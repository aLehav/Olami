Looking to avenge Friday’s five-set loss, the Trojans contained Hawai’i’s Jonas Umlauft and Joshua Walker on Saturday, giving the Warriors no chance at a second consecutive upset, as USC swept Hawai’i in straight sets, 25-20, 28-26, 25-22.

“We did a much better job blocking on Umlauft, held him to a [.237] hitting percentage,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “We got some stuff blocks, but mostly we slowed the ball down so we were able to dig them. We also dug some cross-court balls which forced them to hit back into the blocks and towards our center backs. “
On Friday, the results were much different as Hawai’i’s two stars, Umlauft and Walker, combined for 45 kills and singled-handedly carried the Warriors to a 22-25, 25-22, 15-25, 25-20, 15-10 upset victory.
“In the loss, we played two real good sets and three kind-of-medium sets,” Ferguson said. “We didn’t execute our game plan very well, we didn’t block well and we didn’t defend real well.”
The statistics support Ferguson’s assertion that No. 1 USC (19-2, 18-2) played well in two sets but had a pedestrian showing in the other three. For the match, USC out-hit No. 8 Hawai’i (15-12, 13-9), .383 to .338, and out-dug the Warriors, 36 to 34. In fact, USC scored the same number of points as its opponent.
Although the improved defense was largely a product of re-committing to staying in system, Ferguson singled out senior middle blocker Austin Zahn and junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick for facilitating the Trojans’ offense this weekend with stellar defensive efforts, as they registered a combined 14 blocks. On the offensive end, Zahn and Shandrick, who picked up 15 and 22 kills, respectively, in the two games.
Though USC would have liked to sweep the weekend set, many players still relished the opportunity to play in their home state.
“It was great,” Ferguson said. “There was a lot of family and friends in the stands for those guys, and they really tried to put on a show for them.”
Before the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoffs, USC will close out its regular season at home with games against UCLA on Thursday night and UC Santa Barbara on Saturday. Both matches start at 7 p.m.

Last weekend at No. 13 California, the USC pitching staff allowed 23 runs in 25 innings. This weekend, hosting No. 11 Stanford in a three-game set, the Trojans turned the tables.
All three of their starters went at least seven innings as USC (13-19, 4-5) took two of three from the Cardinal (15-9, 3-3) to win its first Pac-10 series of the season.
Senior pitcher Logan Odom was in control Sunday. The righthander stranded two runners in the first, got a double play to end the third and another in the fifth. In the sixth, he escaped a second and third, one-out jam by striking out the next two Cardinal hitters. In the end, Odom scattered six hits over seven shutout innings to pick up the win and improve his record to 3-4.
“I was throwing all three pitches for strikes today,” Odom said. “Obviously that really helps. Guys can’t sit on one pitch and it keeps them on their toes.”
USC gave Odom support early. Junior catcher Kevin Roundtree led off the first inning with a double, was sacrificed to third and scored on a sacrifice fly.
The Trojans manufactured a run without a hit in the second. Junior first baseman Matt Foat was hit by a pitch and advanced to third on a pair of sacrifices before scoring on a wild pitch to give USC a 2-0 lead.
Roundtree led off the third with another hit and moved to third on a hit-and-run by junior centerfielder Garret Houts. Both ended up scoring on a pair of RBI knocks by Oropesa and Foat to give the Trojans a 4-0 lead.
USC added a pair of runs in the sixth, the first on an infield hit by sophomore left fielder J.R. Aguirre and the second on sacrifice bunt by Roundtree.
Junior closer Chad Smith inherited the bases loaded with two outs in the eight and allowed a two-RBI single but got the next hitter looking to head to the ninth up 6-2. He retired the Cardinal in order in the ninth to clinch the series win.
“We were finally able to relax a little bit,” said USC interim coach Frank Cruz. “We’ve been trying way too hard, and the boys deserve it. Hopefully we can build on this.”
As good as Odom was Sunday, junior pitcher Austin Wood was even better Saturday. The righthander went eight strong innings, allowing just one unearned run. He struck out the side in the first inning and fanned eight hitters over the course of the game while walking just two.
“I was ready to go,” Wood said. “I was tired of not doing well.”
The 3-1 final score was representative of the kind of small-ball game it was. None of the Trojans’ three runs came off of a hit. The first came on a botched squeeze play in the third inning. Houts couldn’t get a bunt down, but Aguirre slid in under the tag and was credited with a straight steal of home.
In the fourth inning Foat scored on a wild pitch, and in the fifth Roundtree scored on a groundout.
Like Odom, Wood was the beneficiary of some clutch double plays, getting out of jams in the second and sixth. After Wood left the game with a runner on in the ninth, Smith got the first hitter he faced to ground into a double play and ended the game with a strikeout for his fourth save of the season.
“I thought we made a lot of quality defense plays today,” Cruz said. “The double plays were huge.”
Friday was what Cruz refers to as a “throwaway game.” Stanford pitcher Mark Appel went the distance, allowing just one unearned run and four hits while striking out seven Trojan hitters. Stanford put up a four-spot in the fifth and ran away with the game 8-1.
“It’s great to bounce back so well after a game like Friday,” Cruz said. “This is a very good team we beat.”
The Trojans are right back at it Tuesday as they travel to Pepperdine for a 3 p.m. matchup against the Waves.

The seats might have been nearly empty, but the USC football team didn’t seem to notice.
On Saturday, the team had one of its liveliest practices of the spring at the Coliseum. Beside the empty seats, it looked a lot like an actual game.
“It was very spirited and competitive,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin.
Go-to guy · Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods scored two touchdowns while the Trojans’ offense practiced its two-minute drill. - Christopher Pham | Daily Trojan 
When the offense went for an early fourth and goal, the defensive sideline hollered in an attempt to distract the offense. They couldn’t stop senior running back Marc Tyler from smashing it up the gut and in, however.
It was Tyler’s first practice participating in full-contact drills.
He went through no-contact drills in his return Tuesday and soft-contact drills Thursday. He said his hamstring felt good in the beginning of practice, but then it got tight and cramped up a bit.
Sophomore running back Dillon Baxter, who impressed in Tyler’s absence, exited midway through the scrimmage with a high ankle sprain.
Kiffin said after practice it was too early to speculate as to the extent of the injury, but he thought Baxter could still return this spring.
The injury was the result of an extremely hard-hitting scrimmage.
It started off with goal-to-go situations, where the injury-depleted offensive line dominated.
This was a dramatic change of pace from other practices, in which the defensive line has been overpowering.

For the first time this spring, USC practiced its two-minute drill. Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods was the target for the first play of all three attempts in the two-minute offense, and he scored both touchdowns.
The offense moved the ball with ease in the hurry-up, the highlight coming when Barkley dropped back, and noticing no one in front of him, tucked it 25 yards for a first down.
The offense faced just one third down, while picking up four first downs.
“Matt did really well,” Kiffin said. “[I] thought he commanded the huddle great.”
The offense went four-and-out in the second two-minute drill, but bounced right back in the third.
The first play was a pass to Woods who would be Barkley’s intended target on five more plays.
Woods snagged a skinny post for 14 yards on a third and 15 that allowed the offense to convert the ensuing fourth and one.
The drive was capped by an 11-yard touchdown grab on third and 10.
“We moved the ball well on offense,” Barkley said. “Our [offensive] line played a lot better than they have in the past, especially in terms of protection.”

Sophomore cornerback Anthony Brown sacked Barkley on one of the scrimmage’s first plays and walk-on senior cornerback Boomer Roepke followed suit midway through the scrimmage.
Junior safety Jawanza Starling had the day’s only interception, which came off freshman quarterback Cody Kessler in a seven-on-seven drill.
When defending a third and 20 early in the scrimmage, USC secondary coach Willie Mack Garza called out his unit, asking them if they remembered the Washington game last season.
The Huskies converted a fourth and 10 for 18 yards against the Trojan defense, which set up a game-winning field goal.
 
—
 
USC invited the 243rd Battalion, known as the “Trojan Battery,” to speak to the team before practice.
The seven-man unit, headed to the Persian Gulf in a couple weeks, and delivered an inspirational speech to the team and presented Kiffin a Battalion coin.
NICE!! Spring is the first building block to a good season. May not be much rest for the starters, so need to get a strong base for stamina and aggressiveness. also need to egt the young studs up to speed who are in spring training.
FIGHT ON!!

I have this very annoying habit when I wake up each morning of anticipating things to come — a tendency to glance at a calendar, eager for some distant event to occur. My initial idea behind this was pure: I wanted the good news to come faster.
Fortunately, I’m not unique in this regard.
At some point in the coming weeks or months, the NCAA will render a decision in regards to USC’s appeal of June’s sanctions.
Granted, nobody knows the day or the hour, but for those of us invested in this ordeal, it’s a moment of great anticipation and even greater uncertainty. The final year of a two-year bowl ban might be lifted and scholarship limitations could potentially be sliced in half.
It could happen, really. Next season, if all goes according to plan — my plan — USC should be celebrating New Year’s in Pasadena, a reprise of the latter years of the Pete Carroll era.
But is this necessarily the proper response? From a fan’s perspective, should probation even matter?
Not entirely.
“It’s about us and not about the NCAA,” said Zack Jerome, who runs the popular USC-centric blog, Lost Angeles. “It’s about enjoying the process: going down Trousdale and hearing the band with a full beer in your hand. Seeing Traveler. Nobody can take that experience away from you.”
Jerome, 28, founded what he calls “Arrogant Nation,” a collection of diehard Trojan football fans encouraged to pay no heed to NCAA rulings — a sort of self-reliance.
Provided USC suits up on Saturdays, he poses the question: What prevents fans from still grabbing a cardinal and gold T-shirt and alcoholic beverage of choice before heading over to a soldout Coliseum?
In a word, nothing.
Lost Angeles opens with a simple, 885-word post titled, “The Most Arrogant Shit Ever,” which encourages fans to drop the Kleenex boxes and enjoy post-sanctions life instead. “Let’s go win, pardon my French, every f–king game,” Jerome remembers thinking on the eve of the 2010 season.
And that’s the heart of his message: Ignore sanctions, ignore the NCAA and ignore the perceptions.
What’s important, at least in Jerome’s mind, is the college experience: that priceless four-year span that became the focal point of the popular blog last season, a sort of rallying cry for fans.
“After the sanctions hit, I saw so many of my underclassman friends talking about how bummed out about the season they were,” he recalled. “And I said, ‘They’re going to let us play.’ We don’t have a playoff so if we go and win every game, we’re still the champs. I didn’t want people to get down on the fact that we couldn’t win a fake national championship.”
Instead of licking his wounds in response to the Committee on Infractions’s mid-June report, Jerome sought to use his platform as a remedy for distraught fans, while also branding that arrogance — that swagger — that is distinctly USC.
“Football is a lifestyle at USC,” he said. “We’re a certain kind of fan and you might not get it if you’re from Auburn and that’s the only thing you have in your life. At USC, we love our football as much as them, but we have it in perspective.”
Much to his surprise, people bought into that notion in the form of T-shirts, snatching up Trojan apparel with slogans such as “Bowls are for salads,” “Lane f–king Kiffin bro”  and “You can’t sanction the endzone” blazoned across the chest.
“It definitely grew faster than I thought,” Jerome said. “I thought that people would like it, but I never thought it would be as much as a rallying cry as it was.”
Unsurprisingly, the blog’s traffic has skyrocketed in recent months. Jerome, a 2005 USC graduate, has been asked to speak on radio shows as well as at events, including the Greek League, Order of Omega and Relay for Life, playing off the site’s popularity.
And though Jerome’s Trojans were barred from partaking in one of 35 bowl games in 2010, he contends many things have remained the same.
Beginning with the team’s Sept. 11 home opener against Virginia, players customarily entered the Coliseum through the southwest stadium tunnel with “Tribute to Troy” blaring. Through 13 games, the offense amassed 403 points, winning eight times. And following a December win over UCLA in the Rose Bowl, Tusk was still put on repeat on the way down the 110.
“It was always about us. The point is that we could still go out every Saturday and go beat the hell out of every team in the Pac-10.”

I know what will happen with sanctions. The SEC controlled NCAA will lift the bowl ban and keep scholarship reductions is place. The bowl ban will be lifted to demonstrate the NCAA “fairness” and placate the university’s need for money. (The NCAA is all about the money, not the well being of athletes). The NCAA doesn’t believe that USC is a BCS threat this year, so lifting the ban will make sense to them. But the SEC hates USC and their perfect record vs the SEC in the Pete Carroll era. They will keep their wings clipped by not reducing scholarship sanctions thereby making it nearly impossible to win a national championship. Furthermore,they will assume the reduced scholarships will limit USC to minor bowls giving plenty of forum fodder to USC haters espousing the inferiority of USC to SEC rivals enjoying the protection of the NCAA.
This is the logic of the corrupt NCAA. There is no justice; only a power hungry, self-serving and corrupt organization hell bent on oppressing student athletes, coaching staffs and even universities that threatens their status as the omnipotent power of college sports. They must be invetigated and disbanded!
[…] because that’s the way things were going to shake out.  I can’t remember if I gave an interview to the Daily Trojan on the car ride home (or was it Thursday), but regardless the Friday commute is awesome because […]

By its own standards, USC is reeling.
For the first time since 2000, the No. 3 USC women’s water polo team (15-5, 3-3) has dropped three games in conference play.
Frustration · Senior two-meter Kristen Dronberger was whistled for three ejections by the third period and forced to watch the rest of the match on the sidelines. Her presence was missed as the Women of Troy fell to UCLA Saturday, 7-5. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Following a loss to No. 1 Stanford in double overtime a week ago, the defending national champions fell in similar fashion Saturday 7-5 at the hands of crosstown rival No. 4 UCLA. This was USC’s second straight loss to a top-five foe.
The Women of Troy had a chance to avert disaster, tying the game at five in the fourth quarter with 6:21 remaining.
But before USC could grab the lead, the Bruins (20-5, 3-3) fought back with two goals from center Grace Reynolds to notch the victory.
“In the last couple of minutes we missed some opportunities,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “It was very similar to the Stanford game. We were 2-for-11 in our opportunities. Our shots didn’t go in.” 
The beginning of the game went well for both teams, particularly in the first frame, with both sides getting on the scoreboard with one goal. But Reynolds proved to be too much to stop through the remainder of the game, scoring four goals.
USC’s attack was more spread out, with five different players each scoring five goals.
“We allowed one of their top players to score four goals, so we just didn’t execute,” said senior driver Joelle Bekhazi.
As the game progressed, a myriad of fouls and other penalties plagued the Women of Troy, giving the host Bruins a decisive advantage.
“We were unlucky,” Bekhazi said. “Two of our best players got two ejections in the first half and one of our best starters wasn’t playing today.”
Senior two-meter Kristen Dronberger had three ejections by the third period, forcing her to sit out the remainder of the game.
Yet despite the technical mistakes by both teams, USC did see a few of its younger players shoulder the load, as freshmen two-meters Kaleigh Gilchrist and Madeline Rosenthal and sophomore driver Blair Moody each finished with a goal apiece.
“In this game, the younger players were playing with more confidence and playing harder than some of our older players,” Vavic said. “We are a young team. Out of our top 11 players, seven are freshmen or sophomores. Those seven really need to learn on the run and there isn’t enough time to teach them anything.” 
Although the loss is USC’s third in Montain Pacific Sports Federation play, it will likely relegate it to the No. 4 seed in the MPSF tournament, scheduled to begin April 29 in San Jose, Calif.
With one conference game remaining on the slate, a home game against San Jose State, there is lasting pressure for a younger Women of Troy team to repeat as national champions.
“Next week is just going to be a big challenge because we have two losses in a row,” Bekhazi said. “We really need to get our confidence back.”

Riding a two-game winning streak the USC women’s tennis team couldn’t continue its success on the road, falling to No. 15 Arizona State (14-5, 6-2) 6-1.
Senior Maria Sanchez was handed her second loss this season, although her singles record still stands at 30-2.
Arizona State’s Kelcy McKenna, the No. 19 singles player in the country, matched Sanchez’s every move and recovered from a 1-6 second set loss to prevail in three sets, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4.
In a rare doubles appearance, Sanchez was paired up with sophomore Danielle Lao to take on the No. 18 doubles squad of McKenna and Micaela Hein. The tandem of Sanchez and Lao fell 8-2 to the Sun Devils pair in the No. 1 spot, marking another usual loss for the Women of Troy (13-6, 2-4).
Lao, who has struggled as of late, had a strong outing on Friday, taking down No. 11 Jacqueline Cako 7-5, 3-2, with Cako retiring because of an injury midway through the second set.
Freshman Kaitlyn Christian was scratched from Friday’s match after a mishap in practice Thursday afternoon.
“[Christian] ran into a pole at the end of practice on Thursday and suffered a bad bruise overnight and she could barely walk on it Friday,” USC coach Richard Gallien said. “Since Valeria [Pulido] was only cleared to play singles, that’s why we were unable to have a third doubles.”
Filling in on court three was Pac-10 Player of the Week junior Alison Ramos, who was a perfect 4-0 last weekend. Against No. 106 Micaela Hein, Ramos fell easily 6-3, 6-2 on a day when nothing seemed to be going right for the Women of Troy.
In her return to singles play, sophomore Valeria Pulido fought hard, albeit in defeat, losing to Arizona State’s Hannah James 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.
Senior Cristala Andrews had another three-set match, her third in the last two weeks, on court five. Andrews fell 3-6, 6-0, 6-3 to Michelle Brycki, while fellow senior Lyndsay Kinstler would also suffer a defeat at the hands of Ashlee Brown (6-4, 6-1) in the sixth spot.
“We will be fine,” Gallien said. “It’s easy to point out the bad luck we’ve had, but it just isn’t interesting. I expect a great week of practice and a very motivated group come Friday.”
With UCLA ahead, the Women of Troy look to avenge an earlier season loss to their crosstown rivals.

USC has launched a Senior Discovery program with Foursquare to encourage graduating seniors to explore the University Park Campus and Health Sciences Campus before the end of the semester.
The initiative works by offering prizes to seniors who check in at various places on campus.
The partnership with Foursquare started last year and has since evolved, according to the Office of the Provost.
Multiple offices, including USC Transportation, USC Athletics, the USC Pertusati Bookstore, USC Libraries and the USC Alumni Association, are working in collaboration with one another to help students familiarize themselves with campus locations.
Ariel Carpenter, director of public relations, said the university wanted to maximize Foursquare’s function as well as create something memorable for seniors.
“We were brainstorming some stuff coming up that Foursquare might be good for in terms of utilizing its geo-location technology,” Carpenter said. “So we thought it would be cool to create a bucket list of some sort for seniors to see their favorite venues across campus and also allow them to check in places that they can visit and win prizes and specials along the way.”
Upon checking in, seniors will discover treasures such as free parking during exam week, travel mugs, USC T-shirts and more.
Along with prizes, there will also be special badges awarded to people who check in multiple times at the same location or check in at a myriad of locations.
Seniors can earn a “campus explorer” badge if they check in at every corner of the campus. The  “bookworm bender” badge is awarded to seniors for multiple check-ins at libraries and “quad squatter,” is given for 10 check-ins at McCarthy quad.
Some students are hesitant about trying the program.
“I am generally not a big fan of the whole checking in thing, but I would do it for the perks like free sporting events tickets,” said Lindsey Vorndran, a senior majoring in creative writing.
Victoria Eliot, a senior majoring in communication, shared Vorndran’s sentiments.
“For personal reasons, I don’t like using Foursquare because I don’t like people knowing where I am at all times,” Eliot said. “But free parking during exams would be nice.”
Other students, however, are glad “Senior Discovery” is encouraging graduating seniors to explore campus.
“I would use this program, said Ashlee Humphrey, a  senior majoring in mechanical engineering. “I think it is great that they are trying to give seniors the opportunity to remember USC and take a last look at the campus so in future years if we come back, we can compare the changes that have transpired. According to Carpenter, the campaign, which launched April 5, has been successful so far.
“A lot of people have been actively checking in, participating, and looking at specials,” Carpenter said.
The program will remain active until commencement.

USC’s graduate school is in the midst of a reorganization that involves changes within the central administration to increase efficiency and the amount of academic programming offered to Ph.D. students.
In a memo to members of the graduate school community last week, Vice Provost for Graduate Programs Sarah Pratt announced several administrative changes, the result of an analysis of the school’s operations led by Provost Elizabeth Garrett.
The analysis was conducted to “ensure that the university’s financial resources are spent as efficiently and strategically as possible,” Pratt said in the memo.
The reorganization has resulted in some layoffs, but Garrett said in a statement that anyone whose job was cut is being offered a severance package and is being encouraged to apply for other positions at the university.
“Reorganizations are never easy,” Garrett said in an email statement. “However, I strongly believe that a large private research university must re-examine itself periodically to ensure that its financial and human resources are allocated to best meet current academic priorities and to do so as efficiently as possible. This is our obligation as stewards of the university and its resources.”
Robert Cooper, vice provost for planning and budget, emphasized the university is not facing any financial hardships — it is simply trying to monitor how it spends its money.
“The university is in a strong financial position,” Cooper said. “The review is part of an ongoing effort to make sure that services are aligned with academic priorities. As stewards of the university’s resources, part of our responsibility is to make sure resources are used in the most effective manner.”
Any money saved as a result of the layoffs will be used for academic purposes, Cooper said.
The reorganization includes combining certain academic services and improving students’ experiences with financial aid and the registrar’s office. The main goal, however, is to create a better academic atmosphere for graduate students.
“Our primary goal is to enhance the excellent training provided by USC faculty with a vibrant, diverse and rigorous university-wide academic culture that will help our students step into the job market with academic and professional skills at the highest possible level,” Pratt said in the memo.
Specifically, the reorganization aims to enhance diversity outreach, help international students better assimilate to the academic culture and address students’ requests for more graduate academic programs.
Though there was some student input on the reorganization, some graduate students still feel uninformed.
“The only things I know about the changes are from the memo,” said Jenny Novak, president of the Graduate & Professional Student Senate. “I think it would have been better if more students had been in the loop.”
Pratt’s memo, which was sent to academic deans, chairs, graduate advisers and graduate student leaders, emphasized that decisions about the reorganization were made as the result of a strategic review by administrators and faculty and of discussions with students on the University Park Campus and the Health Sciences Campus.
Some graduate students welcome the administration’s increased focus on academic programming.
“You have to turn your degree into something,” said Kelley Mowatt, a second-year graduate student studying cell and neurobiology. “You want to be able to have options. So I fully support the focus on professional training.”
The reorganization is expected to be complete by the start of the new fiscal year in July.
“I want to underscore that no changes will be made that would impact our ability to provide students and faculty excellent service,” Garrett said. “This process will improve the undergraduate and graduate student experience at USC.”
I feel rather awful about those who have lost their jobs.  I hope the University does more than simply “encourage” staffers to apply for other positions.  My understanding is that very loyal, long-standing employees were rather suddenly told about this, given “effective-immediately” notices, and the like.  Shameful, I say.  So much for the “Trojan Family.”  
Of course, I don’t mean to suggest that USC has ever treated its staffers well–from union busting to outsourcing to refusing to join the international factory monitoring group, the Workers Rights Consortium–but usually they do a smidge better than this.
I look forward to the university beefing up the graduate faculty to compete with the Berkeley’s out there. The time is now to hire faculty from the crumbling publics of California.

A gallon of regular unleaded is at virtually $4 and oil is trading around $120 a barrel.  Tack onto that the implementation of the Metro ExpressLanes project by the end of this year, and Trojan commuters — along with all Angelenos — are facing the sobering prospect of a very expensive trip down the freeway.
The ExpressLanes project is a one-year pilot program that will shut down the high occupancy vehicle lanes on both the I-10 and I-110 Freeways, replacing them with high occupancy tolled lanes.  Access to the lanes will be based not on occupancy, as with the HOV lanes, but on the payment of a toll.
The project will replicate what is currently done on the 91 Express Lanes in Orange County, offering drivers an opportunity to pay a toll to escape congestion in the adjacent lanes.
Carpoolers will, however, still be able to access the HOT lanes free of charge at all times on the I-110, but only during off-peak hours on the I-10.
But, despite the appeal to consumers, HOT lanes will not reduce congestion in the long-term.
The HOT lanes will be dynamically priced to reflect real-time congestion; prices rise as HOT lanes fill up and fall as they empty out. Pricing is set to ensure traffic within HOT lanes is moving at 45 miles per hour or faster, guaranteeing HOT customers get what they pay for.
So why would the feds fund a Demonstration Project on two of the area’s busiest freeways?  Metro has stated the goal of the project is to facilitate “reduced congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, increased travel time savings, and better trip reliability.”
Charging admission for faster travel times in one HOT lane would pull, at first, a few vehicles out of the “free” traffic flow — but they would quickly be replaced by other vehicles.  Such an effect is well documented by transportation planners and economists.
Overall demand for freeways vastly exceeds supply. Raising the access price of just one lane — and on only two freeways at that — will not significantly tamp down demand to meet supply.
Even if the pilot project generates major revenue and is turned into a permanent program so that every freeway in Los Angeles has a HOT lane, the story remains the same.
If nothing else, this project indicates just how financially strapped both Metro and Caltrans are; charging for HOT access is both less-regressive and more appropriate way of funding freeway improvements than a sales tax.
But it won’t solve the traffic problem. The only real solution to congestion in Los Angeles is to dynamically price,  charging different groups different prices, all freeway access. Allowing some commuters to whiz by congestion in adjacent lanes for a fee will not solve the city’s traffic issues.
 
Teddy Minch is a graduate student studying public policy and civil infrastructure finance.
HOT lanes have proven to be successful  in reducing congestion in other parts of Southern California (Orange County, San Diego County) for rmore than a decade.  They have also been successful in other parts of the country.  The Metro Express Lanes offer Los Angeles County an opportunity to improve travel choices for commuters through the one-year pilot program.  On I-110, the Harbor Transitway (between Adams Blvd and 190th Street) will be converted to HOT lanes.  For about 8 miles, there are two carpool lanes in each direction.  Both of the lanes will be converted.  It is important to note that on both the I-110 and I-10 – no general purpose lanes will be tolled and carpools that meet the existing occupancy requirements will travel toll free.  On I-10, Metro will add another HOT lane by re-striping the existing buffer for about 9 miles along the I-10 El Monte Busway — both carpool lanes will be converted to HOT lanes without taking away any general purpose lanes.  In addition, Metro is purchasing more than 40 new clean fuels buses to improve transit service on the Express Lanes.
While demand for freeway capacity does exceed supply, Metro’s Express Lanes Program offers incentives to encourage transit, vanpools, and carpools, as well as providing single drivers access to the Express Lanes when space is available.  With 10 million people and growing in Los Angeles County, we can’t afford not to look at all options to improve mobility.
What reed said
Just change for access to all the freeways, and use the massive amount of profits to rapidly build more rail lines.  The vast majority of freeway traffic in LA is single-occupancy commuter traffic, which is exactly the population that could (and should) be offloaded onto much more space-efficient mass-transit. Such mass transit WILL get better in LA if more people use it (i.e. more funding and more service, because mass-transit is far more scale-able than road capacity), but people need an incentive to take it. Right now, heavy traffic is not a strong enough incentive to get people out of their cars. Perhaps a $3-5 toll at every on-ramp would be. Imagine if, rather than adding lanes to the 405, we made it a toll road and built a fast rail line parallel to it? Person-moving capacity would be exponentially better, and trains never get in traffic jams.

Here’s a question: What do the entrance of Leavey, the area near Trojan Grounds and the courtyard of VKC have in common?
If you answered “a frequent haze of cigarette smoke,” give yourself a congratulatory pat on the back.
Or rather — don’t. We should be ashamed USC still permits smoking on campus.
Cindy Lee | Daily Trojann
Even with Global Health Week last week and Pre-health Week this week, it seems a very important aspect of student health at USC has been sorely neglected.
According to no-smoke.org, more than 500 other universities across the nation have already gone completely smoke-free, and it’s about time USC did the same, for the sake of students, faculty, staff and visitors.
Members of the USC faculty are pushing for a smoke-free campus to  become a reality, and soon.
Given the smoky haze that blankets much of campus, it seems this is a necessary step.
At the moment, smoking is prohibited in enclosed buildings, facilities and university vehicles on both of USC’s campuses
USC’s Health Sciences Campus has already gone completely smoke-free to protect patients, staff and visitors in the hospitals and research centers.
Why cigarette butts pepper USC’s main campus, however, remains a mystery.
Is it because USC is uninterested in the health of its students and faculty? Is it out of fear of a backlash from those who argue smoking should not be regulated by the university because it is a personal choice?
As a non-smoker, I should be able to walk across campus without having to breathe tobacco smoke. Second-hand smoke can cause negative health effects such as a dramatically increased risk of lung cancer, heart attacks and possible neurological damage. Studies have also shown the toxic chemicals from cigarette smoke leave harmful residue on clothing, walls, benches and other objects that come into contact with the smoke.
Some argue banning smoking entirely would leave no safe places for smokers.
To correct for this, perhaps there could be a few designated smoking areas faraway from areas of heavy student traffic or smoking rooms or like the “booths” commonly used in airports. Currently, the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and the Pertusati Bookstore are designated smoking areas. There are ways to accommodate smokers without placing the entire USC population at risk.
Additionally, USC should implement programs to help people quit smoking to ease the transition to a smoke-free campus. Education on the harmful health effects of tobacco smoke should be continued, as well.
In April 2010, the Academic Senate passed an initiative to put USC on the path of a smoke-free campus. Shortly after, members of the USC Staff Assembly, who are elected by the staff of the university to serve two-year terms, have also passed an initiative to make USC completely smoke-free.
Now, it is up to the Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate and Professional Student Senate to take action.
If USC really does make its students and faculty’s well being a top priority, then we should soon be able to walk from one end of campus to the other without shortening our life expectancies because of repeated exposure to tobacco smoke.
 
Rebecca Gao is a freshman majoring in global health and biological sciences. Her column, “Trojan Grounds,” runs Mondays.
I hate cigarette smoke and I hate tobacco companies. That said, we have turned into a nation of unbelievable whiners and sanctimonious blowhards who have nothing better to do then moan and groan about make believe problems. Rebecca, can you tell me someone you know who has died of second hand smoke from OUTDOOR exposure? How about this deadly scourge known as third hand smoke? You probably have more exposure to toxic microorganisms when you touch public keyboards at the computer center or use public toilets. You and others who want to go to such extremes as a 100% smoking ban indoors and outdoors, sound like people who can not go anywhere without their Purell and oxygen tank. This is why cities like Santa Monica are a joke. They are tough on making fluff laws to make sure taxpayers can not smoke indoors or outdoors but are very liberal and lax if you are a homeless person who wants to urinate and defecate in the public parks. Banning smoking in enclosed places like buildings or the tram makes sense and is reasonable. If you are someone who is so overly concerned about residual traces of cigarettes on an outdoor bench, you need to take a good long look at yourself and ask what exactly are your priorities.
Actually I think Ms. Gao’s article is pretty well done: the main failing is in being too trusting of her sources. I was the same way as a freshman!
I had missed noticing something else while reading it though. Rebecca notes that “toxic chemicals from cigarette smoke leave harmful residue” on such things as benches. Since we’re talking about outdoor smoking bans, I think it’s safe to presume she meant outdoor benches.
If you Google the two words “attocuries” and “kabat” and click on the “Global Health Law” link in the Results, you’ll see an extended commentary about the most heavily headlined study on this “Thirdhand Smoke” phenomenon indoors in people’s homes. The NY Times and Scientific American highlighted one particularly “toxic chemical” of concern, radioactive Polonium 210, and to help readers understand the danger they were in they pointed to the poisoning several years back of a Russian spy using a microscopic amount of this substance.
I decided to see just how much danger someone might be in if they not only “contacted” such surfaces, but actually spent a few hours a day conscientiously licking ten square feet of flooring in smokers’ homes absolutely clean. As you’ll see from the link above, it would take roughly 3 trillion years to get the dose that brought the Commie to the ground.
Now an outdoor bench with breezes blowing all around it is obviously going to “absorb” an extraordinarily small amount of “poison” compared to a floor in a smoker’s home. Perhaps 1/1,000th of the amount would be a reasonable guess. Let’s further guess that the average outdoor campus bench in a smokers’ area had ten square feet of surface on its seating.
It would then take the average student licking an entire smokers’ bench sparkly clean every single day close to 3 QUADRILLION years (i.e. over 2,000x as long as our universe has existed) to get poisoned like the poor KGB chap. And of course, as I pointed out in that article, the poor grad student would not only have to suspend the laws of physics regarding half-life, but they’d also have to refrain from going to the bathroom for the whole time.
If they held off on their doctoral thesis until the end, they would be certain to win the prize for a thesis more full of a certain aromatic substance than any produced in all of academic history.

I guess we can’t be existentialists then. After all existentialism is a style of life centered on whiskey, cigarettes, and long discussion of politics and philosophy that last until the early hours.
No offense, but these columns get somewhat tiring to read because they ALWAYS seem to portray a stereotypical/obvious opinion. The suggestions that are suggested are obvious, cliche ones. It would have been more interesting if a column of someone defending smoking was printed–it is a different viewpoint from most people and would have made a more interesting read.
America was founded with the staple cash crop tobacco as its main source of economy in the 1600s. Without that initial economy, the American colonies could not have slowly but surely evolved into the superpower it is. Being against the freedom of smoking in the open is un-American.
This article is woeful. Nauseatingly sanctimonious. Leave smokers alone and realize that there is pollution everywhere, smokers are few in number on campus and barely noticeable most of the time, and you have no right to go inconvenienced. More people are annoyed at your articles.
I would like to add my voice to the chorus of derision being heaped on this article. It is woeful, badly research, unnuanced and preachy. And isn’t this exactly the same column that was run in the DT previously? When I walk past VKC, I see two people smoking- tops- every now and then. By an ashtray. And only a busybody would notice.
Why don’t we ban driving while we’re at it. The fumes from cars’ exhausts are way more harmful to us than cigarette smoke. I get so tired of these people who have been brainwashed into believing a few outdoor smokers’ smoke is going to harm them. You’re living in Los Angeles, the smog capital of North America, your health is in a lot more danger from other forms of pollution. The haze over USC’s campus is not cigarette smoke, it’s pollution. If I see or hear one more person whining about cigarette smoke I’m going to scream!
Actually I think Ms. Gao’s article is pretty well done: the main failing is in being too trusting of her sources.  I was the same way as a freshman!
I had missed noticing something else while reading it though.  Rebecca notes that “toxic chemicals from cigarette smoke leave harmful residue” on such things as benches.  Since we’re talking about outdoor smoking bans, I think it’s safe to presume she meant outdoor benches.

Perhaps 1/1,000th of the amount would be a reasonable guess.  Let’s further guess that the average outdoor campus bench in a smokers’ area had ten square feet of surface on its seating.
It would then take the average student licking an entire smokers’ bench sparkly clean every single day close to 3 QUADRILLION years (i.e. over 2,000x as long as our universe has existed)  to get poisoned like the poor KGB chap.  And of course, as I pointed out in that article, the poor grad student would not only have to suspend the laws of physics regarding half-life, but they’d also have to refrain from going to the bathroom for the whole time.
If they held off on their doctoral thesis until the end, they would be certain to win the prize for a thesis more full of a certain aromatic substance than any produced in all of academic history.

Slight correction:  I believe I mislaid a couple of decimals there. If our universe is about 15 billion years old it would take about 200,000 universe life cycles for the student to properly prepare that Ph.D. thesis to glowing perfection.

P.S.  And if I’m still off a bit it’s because my brain melts when it computes quadrillions.
Miss Gao’s columns are about the most poorly researched fluff opinion pieces I have ever read! Why do people continue to make comments on them? Oh wait–I’m making a comment on one. I’m confused now.
Rebecca Gao, you wrote, “Second-hand smoke can cause negative health effects such as a dramatically increased risk of lung cancer,”
Rebecca, you’ve read too much propaganda without putting enough thought into checking the original sources and then analyzing what you read.  The above sentence is a good example, particularly in terms of open-air campus bans.  
The EPA estimate for environmental tobacco smoke caused lung cancer is an increase in the base rate of about 4 in a thousand by 19% after 40 solid years of continuous daily exposure indoors for 8 hours a day.  That’s one extra cancer for every 40,000 worker-years.
Now your exposure walking around the campus, particularly if it’s something you have any concern about, is likely to be on the order of about 1 minute per day instead of 8 hours.   And that 1 minute of exposure is likely to be about 90% more dilute than you would be getting if you worked indoors with smokers.  So those 40,000 years would have to be multiplied by (8×60 = 480) and then again by a factor of ten.   
So the normal campus exposure if you fully accept without question the antismoking advocates own figures would be one extra lung cancer for every 40k x 4.8k years of school.  If we factor in three to four months of vacations/breaks, that then becomes 40k x about 8k years.  That’s one extra lung cancer for every 320 MILLION student-years.
THAT is your “dramatically increased risk of lung cancer.”
I’ve heard of perpetual grad students, but I think that’s stretching it a bit.

Michael: What about smoking dope?
I’m sorry, Rebecca, but can you possibly defend the notion that outdoor second hand smoke has shortened your lifespan?  Really?  Really??
Did anyone ask the neighbors who agree to allow the school to exist at its present location tax free?
You forgot the rest of your question. (first sentence)
Whoah,
 hold up there. Passing more laws is not the answer. USC doesn’t, like, need to turn into Mordor. Students and staff can make their own decisions about smoking, they don’t need some nanny student government to tell them how to live.
FYI, you can’t actually smoke in the campus center.
I am completely against cigarettes.  However I have a medical condition that can only be treated with marijuana.  I think USC should provide a safe place for us with legitimate medical needs where we can smoke and relax without being worried that DPS is going to arrest or bother us.
“As a non-smoker, I should be able to walk across campus without having to breathe tobacco smoke. Second-hand smoke can cause negative health effects such as a dramatically increased risk of lung cancer, heart attacks and possible neurological damage. Studies have also shown the toxic chemicals from cigarette smoke leave harmful residue on clothing, walls, benches and other objects that come into contact with the smoke.”
Next thing you know, you will suddenly have the right not to be exposed to drinkers or overweight people.  Good grief!  Get a life as soon as possible.  I don’t think you are going to be attacked by clothing, walls, benches or other objects.
That’s not even a reasonable comparison. The author (and anyone else interested in their health) isn’t complaining about exposure to smoke just because they don’t like it. Last I heard, being around “drinkers or overweight people” wasn’t linked to health risks. 
Sure, you can smoke if you want to, but forcing this on other students and faculty is just not acceptable. Second-hand smoke is more dangerous than smoking directly–who put MY health in YOUR hands?
I thought USC and UCLA were rivals. You know all the CA no smoking rules were started up by a prof at UCLA, don’t you?
Hmm, I wonder if the no smoke proposal includes pot.
I doubt it.

Across the world, Zumba fitness seems to be growing in popularity at an exponential rate.
Whether you’re young, old, a fantastic dancer or a terrible one, everyone nowadays seems to be cranking up Latin music.
Zumba is a relatively new craze that first hit the world in 2001, after fitness instructor Alberto Perez replaced his usual aerobics music tapes with his own mix of Latin music.
The official Zumba website claims it is the only dance-fitness program to draw a crowd of more than 10 million people worldwide, making it a truly universal sensation.
But what makes it so popular?
For one, nearly anyone can do it. Most classes don’t require any dance experience, and there isn’t any distinction between the beginners and the more advanced dancers when it comes to Zumba dancing.
The atmosphere is specifically designed to promote unity and encouragement.
Like regular aerobics classes, you mirror an instructor’s moves.
But instead of counting reps, the primary focus is on keeping up with the rhythm and the beat and, of course, having fun.
USC has not been immune to the worldwide obsession.
At the Trojan Dance Marathon on Feb. 16, one of the dance activities was a group-wide Zumba session, in which a seasoned instructor choreographed an easy-to-follow routine to a variety of Latin beats.
There are also Zumba classes available at the Lyon Center.
The recent Zumba movement has also manifested itself in the new seven-disc set called Zumba Fitness Exhilarate: The Ultimate Experience DVD Set, which is scheduled to be released Friday.
The collection is priced at $149.99 on Amazon.com and comes with a pair of special Zumba toning sticks, which are basically weights you hold while you dance, Exhilarate attempts to target a wide range of people with its great variety of fun workout options.
It has routines for beginners as well as warm-ups for those rushing to fit in an easy workout.
Each DVD serves a unique purpose and dancers can find one to fit their schedule and comfort level.
But is the set ultimately worth buying?
The truth is several cheaper alternatives exist that are better options for those looking to see what the Zumba craze is all about.
For college students, attending fitness classes on- or off-campus isn’t always flexible, and forking out a hundred bucks isn’t an option, either.
Instead of the Exhilarate collection, students can purchase the slightly cheaper and older Zumba Fitness Total Body Transformation System DVD Set. The collection is a four-disc set that is available for a somewhat more reasonable price of $65.
But if you’re looking for something even cheaper, your best bet is to invest in the one-and-only Zumba Fitness video game.
It is available for about $40 on Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 game consoles.
Although there are several ways to get involved in Zumba, there’s no denying the advertisements and products specifically target a female audience.
Zumba might have been originally designed by a man, but it’s difficult to encourage men to get seriously involved in working out when images of scantily clad, stomach-showing women dominate the covers of DVD sets and advertisements.
Even the new Exhilarate collection, with its seven separate discs, has just a single disc with the image of a male dancer on it. The rest have women.
But men shouldn’t use these examples as an excuse to skip out on trying Zumba.
In fact, there seems to have been backlash recently against the presumptions that Zumba is a “feminine” sport.
A Facebook page called “Men can Zumba too, ” was created in Sept. 2010, to encourage more male participation.
It’s true Zumba classes are dominated by women, but men shouldn’t hesitate to give them a shot, or at least invest in a DVD or two to get started.
Zumba, after all, is meant to be accessible to all types of people in a variety of forms, from fitness classes to DVD sets.
Your gender, age and physical ability are all irrelevant when it comes to having fun while getting a workout.
And that’s what Zumba’s all about.

In Dec. 1984, right before midnight and without warning, the gas leaked from the Union Carbide factory. The cool night breeze blew the gas — extremely toxic methyl isocynate — over the city of Bhopal, India, exposing hundreds of thousands of citizens to poisonous chemicals.
Photos courtesy of Bhopali press site
Though figures vary, the immediate death toll was somewhere between 2,400 and 3,500 people. Activists allege 25,000 people died as a direct and indirect result of gas exposure.
The factory still stands today, the 26-year-old chemicals continuing to poison the ground and the surrounding land. Union Carbide and its owner, the Dow Chemical Company, both refuse to take responsibility and clean up the remnants of the disaster.
Bhopali, a documentary by newcomer Van Maximillian “Max” Carlson, looks at Bhopal today, reviewing the wreckage of that calm December night’s events. Bhopali is one of the most impactful and poignant documentaries released in recent memory, but it is certainly not an easy film to watch.
The genuine human struggle of those affected coupled with the lack of contemporary news coverage and the sheer unjustness of it all, however, makes this film a must-see.
That probably sounds like an overstatement, but like 2006’s An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore’s groundbreaking documentary about global warming, Bhopali is a revelation.
Many people today seem to be unaware of the tragedy in Bhopal. Though it might not be covered in mainstream media, the struggle continues, with activists’ cries for continued litigation muted by international and corporate law.
Carlson’s documentary, presented so compellingly, shines a glaring light on a population that has been so systematically maligned.
Minute after minute, Bhopali brilliantly focuses the lens on ordinary people in extraordinarily tragic positions.
There are the activists, of course, but the film also tells the story of a woman survivor who must deal with her speech-impaired, physically challenged son; a family that must cope with a depressed infant, unable to even sit upright; and a man who lost his parents and five of his eight siblings in one fell swoop on the night of the gas leak.
Characters are often the critical components of a film’s narrative success, and in that sense Bhopali is a blockbuster. You simply cannot ignore these peoples’ stories.
Moreover, Carlson masterfully weaves the events of the gas leak, the testimonies of survivors and the current legal pursuit.
One survivor’s moment flows into the technical aspects of the contamination, which flows again into the legal turmoil behind the catastrophe. Even acclaimed political activist, philosopher and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor of linguistics Noam Chomsky, makes an appearance, narrating the governmental issues that allow the tragedy in Bhopal to continue today.
From an aesthetic standpoint, the film is intensely beautiful, with a blend of talented cinematography and cleverly animated court documents, diagrams and even a graphic novel-esque sequence that somehow works perfectly in tandem with the recount of the gas leak and the subsequent flee from the descending fumes.
Still, all of this glossy production does not take away from the friction of the subject material. In actuality, the beauty of the filmmaking highlights two things: a beautiful community has been, in many ways, destroyed and that there is a sort of beauty in the cautious hopefulness of that same community today.
Bhopali isn’t a perfect documentary by any means, mostly because it has a clear bias and leaves out the opposing point of view of the events from that horrific night (though the film does state the Union Carbide and The Dow Chemical Company refused to answer questions).
In the end, however, Bhopali isn’t just about the disaster itself. It’s a film that primarily reflects on human nature and how the people of Bhopal still fight to take care of their own when the battle already seems lost.
To have to fight for normalcy nearly 27 years after the original travesty is a task of Homeric proportions that no one should have to undertake.
While most of the world, including The Dow Chemical Company and its subsidiary, Union Carbide, continues to leave behind the memory of history’s worst industrial disaster, Bhopali stands as a forceful reminder that justice has yet to be served.

USC practiced at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Saturday morning, but one player was unexpectedly not on the field.
Wide receiver Markeith Ambles was not in attendance, and USC coach Lane Kiffin stated after the practice that Ambles had not told any member of the coaching staff where he was.
“He wasn’t here this morning,” Kiffin told the media after practice. “It went on as normal, so we’ll figure it out.”
Ambles has had difficulty staying out of trouble during his short tenure at USC. He arrived late to a mandatory team weightlifting session last week and was forced to run around Howard Jones Field, the Trojans’ usual practice spot, on Thursday instead of participating in the team’s practice.
Last October, the 19-year old wideout was suspended for two weeks before later leaving the team in November. He decided to rejoin the team in January after contemplating a possible transfer.
Last year, Ambles was one of the most highly regarded receivers who committed to USC. He has, however, yet to live up to the hype, catching just one pass last season – a three-yard completion during the team’s Sept. 25 game at Washington State. That play kept him from having the option of redshirting last season.
Over the past year, the sophomore has served several punishments after arriving late to team functions or not showing up at all. He has had to miss a number of practices and participate in extra conditioning drills.

We The Kings unleashed its first single,“Friday is Forever,” from its upcoming studio album. So far, the album is untitled and has no confirmed release date, but the band is aiming for it to hit stores sometime during this summer.
“Friday is Forever,” similar to the songs on WTK’s album Smile Kid, gives off of a summer vibe. It captures the upbeat and free-spirited sound the band is known for.
Although the lyrics dabble in a bit of relationship drama, with lines like I knew a girl in shades of blue / who broke my heart and said ‘We’re through,’  it still moves along in a care-free way.
WTK tends to write songs where the chorus is a hook that has entire crowds singing along. The new single is no different from that with lyrics such as Friday is forever, we belong together / So come on, come on and don’t you say never.
The catchy tune can currently be heard exclusively on AOL Music and this Tuesday, the single will be available for purchase on iTunes.
If you want to head over to the east coast the last weekend of April, WTK will be performing in New Jersey at this year’s Bamboozle Festival.

Award-winning director Sidney Lumet, 86, died of lymphoma on Saturday at his home in Manhattan.  Lumet was personally nominated for four Oscars during his lifetime for gritty dramas, such as The Verdict, Network, Dog Day Afternoon and 12 Angry Men.  On being presented an honorary Lifetime Achievement Oscar in 2005, he told New York Times, “I wanted one, damn it, and I felt I deserved one.”
After directing films that accumulated over 40 Academy Award nominations, this desire was not undeserved.
The Oscar-winning director was also a favorite among actors.  In an interview earlier this year, actress Ali MacGraw, who starred in Lumet’s film Just Tell Me What You Want, told The Wall Street Journal, Lumet was “every actor’s dream.”
Lumet also directed stars like Al Pacino, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Marlon Brando, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Faye Dunaway, Dustin Hoffman and Michael Jackson, just to name a few.
But the legendary filmmaker’s talent lives on through his daughter, Jenny Lumet, writer of the Oscar-nominated, family drama Rachel Getting Married.  Lumet also directed his daughter in the crime thriller, Q&A.
Lumet is survived by his wife Mary Gimbel, stepdaughter Leslie, stepson Bailey Gimbel and daughters Amy and Jenny Lumet.
