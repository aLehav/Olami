Undergraduate Student Government President Monish Tyagi emphasized providing students with an incredible experience Tuesday night when he was sworn into office.
Tyagi pledged to provide all students with ‘the premier undergraduate experience,’ a phrase often used by Former President Chris Cheng.

Cheng introduced Tyagi as someone who has already “worked extremely hard for this organization and for the student body as a whole.”
“I’m very excited to have someone replace me who is better, funnier, better-looking and probably a bit taller,” Cheng said.
Tyagi said he wanted to continue USG’s role as representatives of students’ interests to university administrators, a role emphasized by Cheng’s administration.
“I will build relationships with administration and alumni and bridge the gap between students and administrators,” Tyagi said. “I will reach out to a wide array of diverse students, and I will work tirelessly day in and day out to keep life here at USC great for years to come.”
Tyagi said his role as USG president is important because students applying to USC are interested in more than just outstanding academics or nice facilities.
“College students are looking for more than education, they are looking for an experience – a place to call home, make lifelong friends and lifelong memories,” Tyagi said. “We have been entrusted with providing students with the unique USC undergraduate experience.”
Tyagi also teased Cheng for his sometimes unorthodox behavior during his presidential term.
“It’s time to access the work of the previous administration and look up the things I want to change,” Tyagi said. “Next year, you won’t see me jumping over tables in [executive board] meetings; you won’t see me attending groundbreaking ceremonies in a red suit and you won’t hear me end phone calls with the phrase ‘holla holla.'”
Overall, Tyagi said he was excited to begin his term.
“It’s a humbling feeling to know that I’ve been chosen by my peers to serve the undergraduate student body,” Tyagi said. “And it’s an honor to be passed the torch by a great leader and one of my best friends.”

It sounded for a bit like USC coach Lane Kiffin was going to say he was excited about his team.
“To watch our team, we do have some star players,” Kiffin said. “We do have some legitimate NFL star players. But there’s such a gap between those guys and … the bottom of our roster.”
He’s back · Senior running back Marc Tyler returned to practice Tuesday after suffering a hamstring injury the first day of spring training. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Kiffin said he feels although there is a lot of skill within the team right now, they really lack depth, identifying only seven “great” players.
Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods was mentioned first, followed by junior quarterback Matt Barkley, senior tight end Rhett Ellison, junior defensive end Nick Perry, junior safety T.J. McDonald, sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey and junior safety Tony Burnett.
Beyond that, however, Kiffin is not terribly pleased with his team right now.
“Our challenge is to develop those [lower starters], get the new guys to come in here, get the injured guys back and develop a team,” Kiffin said. “Because right now we would not be a very good team.”
Dealing with a disproportionate number of injuries and illnesses this spring, Kiffin said he is eager to get to the fall.
“We’re excited for the fall with all the new guys coming in,” he said. We have 22 new guys. But we have a lot of work to do to develop into a team instead of just having four or five star players.”
Kiffin did note, however, he was pleased that many of the players performing best this spring are young.
Today, that included redshirt freshman safety Patrick Hall, who had a pair of interceptions. Hall picked off redshirt freshman quarterback Jesse Scroggins during the scrimmage after jumping in front of a Barkley pass in a special teams drill.
“Patrick [Hall] had a really good day,” Kiffin said. “He was matched up against Robert [Woods] and he shut him down.”
Hall’s play was representative of practice as a whole for the defense. The offense didn’t score a touchdown in the scrimmage, and the depleted and injury-plagued offensive line was overwhelmed in the trenches, getting no push on running plays and forcing the quarterbacks to rush their throws.
“[The] biggest question mark that hasn’t been answered is the offensive line,” Kiffin said. We have one legitimate college player there right now in [junior tackle] Matt [Kalil], and none of the other guys have played a legitimate snap of college football ever. There’s a lot of work to do there.”
The offensive line will return just two of five starters in Kalil and junior center Khaled Holmes, who is out for the spring with a neck injury.
Senior tailback Marc Tyler was back at practice Tuesday after injuring his hamstring in the team’s first practice of the spring.
Tyler wore full pads and participated in basic running back drills but appeared to be running a little gingerly. He sat out all contact activities, including the scrimmage.
Junior defensive end Wes Horton and senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou participated in full team drills for the first time this spring.
Tupou, however, left practice early after getting “banged on the knee,” according to Kiffin. He did not seem worried, though.

Location for USC, Kansas game still unknown
Though USC will take on perennial basketball powerhouse Kansas next season, one thing has yet to be determined: where the game will be played.
USC is set to host the game per a home-and-home agreement, but Kansas coach Bill Self confirmed last week the Trojans asked the game be moved from Los Angeles to the 15,000-seat Intrust Arena in Wichita, Kan., — a sure sellout in Jayhawk territory.
Regardless of the game’s location, USC would still act as the home team and gate proceeds would go to the Trojans.
Earlier Tuesday, however, additional reports surfaced that plans to move the game to the Midwest had fallen through.
“Trojans planning to host Kansas on Dec. 22; and, also, the proposed game with Duke is off, sources say. Plans fell through,” tweeted Los Angeles Times reporter Baxter Holmes.
Neither school has made an announcement about the location of the game.
USC last played the Jayhawks at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kan., on Dec. 18 of last year, where the Trojans fell just short of an upset, losing to the then-No. 3 Kansas team 70-68.
The Trojans, who will also take on North Carolina during the upcoming season, were trying to schedule a game against Duke, giving USC three high-profile, non-conference opponents.

Women’s rowing off to strong start
The No. 9 USC women’s rowing team started its season off on the right foot with a winning weekend at the San Diego Crew Classic, as both the varsity eight and varsity four boats captured titles.
For USC’s varsity eight, the victory was its third Jessop-Whittier title overall and first since 2007.
USC also captured the inaugural Karen Plumleigh Cortney Cup, taking first place in the Collegiate 4+ Grand Final.
The Women of Troy’s second varsity eight and second varsity four also had solid showings. The second varsity eight took third place in the Collegiate 2V Grand final, placing ahead of Wisconsin, Washington State and UCLA. Meanwhile, the Second Varsity Four took home the petite final of the collegiate fours race.
“The team is coming along,” USC coach Zenon Babraj told USCTrojans.com. “They were very focused today, staying within the boat and executing the tactics we’ve been working on. We had a good day, but it’s early in the season and there is still a lot of racing between now and NCAA’s.”

Tex Winter elected to Hall of Fame 
Basketball mastermind and former USC hoops star Fred “Tex” Winter has been, at long last, inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on Monday.
During his senior year at USC in 1947, Winter played basketball for the Trojans alongside fellow Hall of Famer’s Alex Hannum and Bill Sharman.
Following graduation, Winter kick-started his coaching career, landing an assistant coach position at Kansas State. He then went on to coaching positions at Marquette, Kansas State, Washington, Northwestern and Long Beach State, as well as an NBA coaching job with the Houston Rockets.
Winter is credited with creating the famed triangle offense, which the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers utilized on their way to a combined nine NBA titles. He is also credited with mentoring legendary coaches Doug Collins and Phil Jackson.
Winter served as an assistant coach on the Chicago Bulls from 1985 to 1998 before following Jackson to the Lakers where he worked from 1999 to 2008. In total, Winter has more than 60 years of coaching experience at the collegiate and NBA levels.
Winter is set to be inducted Aug. 12 with 10 other basketball legends, including Dennis Rodman, Chris Mullin and Artis Gilmore. After falling just short of induction seven times, Winter will be enshrined in Springfield at the age of 89.
“It’s about time. It’s very well deserved,” said Lakers guard Kobe Bryant. “I’m beyond happy for him. It’s exciting, a little past due, but better late than never.”

In every level of athletic competition, there is one core tenet coaches use when looking toward the future: To be the best, you have to beat the best.
The USC men’s basketball team turned a corner in that regard with wins over non-conference foes like Texas and Tennessee in 2010, though the challenge of taking that next step toward national recognition requires a steadfast commitment to continuing the trend.
Since Nikola Vucevic’s decision to forgo his senior season, many have said USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s 2011-12 squad will need to grow up in a hurry if it wants any chance of playing deep into March.
With the loss of Vucevic and graduating seniors Alex Stepheson, Marcus Simmons and Donte Smith, the Trojans will enter their second straight season without four of their top six scorers from the previous year.
Throw in the fact that next year’s replacements — transfers Aaron Fuller and DeWayne Dedmon and freshman recruit Bryon Wesley — have never played a single minute in cardinal and gold, and the prospects look bleak.
O’Neill’s rough month on (being out-coached by Shaka Smart) and off (altercation with University of Arizona booster) the court makes it even harder to see how the puzzle pieces will fit together.
Say what you will about the beleaguered coach and his mixed bag of players, but O’Neill might have just saved the season eight months before it even begins.
How?
By scheduling tough early season games against Kansas, North Carolina and potentially Duke, all of which will occur outside the friendly confines of the Galen Center.
Playing non-conference games, whether they are in Kansas, Las Vegas or Durham, N.C., not only makes for a more battle-tested team come conference play, but it illustrates a willingness to compete against any team in the country, regardless of ranking or pedigree.
Take a look at the teams that played in Monday’s national championship game.
Aside from the fact it ended up being the worst title game in recent memory, both Butler and Connecticut remained unscathed through the first five rounds of the tournament in part because of their extremely tough non-conference schedules.
Among the ranked teams the two faced on their paths to the first Monday in April were Duke, Louisville, Kentucky, Michigan State and Texas.
For USC, scheduling games against three of the past four national champions lends credence to the idea the university is serious about its men’s basketball program, despite the common belief that the round ball plays second fiddle to the pigskin around these parts.
What non-conference game is more exciting to you, USC football vs. Syracuse or USC men’s basketball vs. UNC?
The trickle-down effect of a tough non-conference schedule can only be positive. Whether the team goes 2-1 or 0-3 against these elite opponents is almost of secondary importance.
And O’Neill’s plan goes much deeper, from pleasing the tournament committee on Selection Sunday if the team falls on the bubble to promoting USC on a national level and impressing recruits who might want to one day don a Trojan uniform.
The program, even as it tries to clean up its recently tarnished image, has received very little attention around the country, primarily because the team is never on national television. Outside of the play-in game against VCU and the ESPN circus that ensued after O’Neill’s one-game suspension, you’d be hard-pressed to find people on the East Coast who even know USC has a basketball team, let alone a promising one.
O’Neill has used his connections in the coaching community for the long-term betterment of the program.
I’m a fan of November and December victories against UC Riverside and Lehigh as much as the next person, but quality teams don’t mask their deficiencies with superfluous wins.
Instead, they use the non-conference period as a meaningful, tournament-style barometer to gauge how far they still need to go. And, it’s just the right kind of test cable networks find attractive come the holiday season.
That might mean a blowout loss to Coach K at Cameron Indoor or another gut-wrenching defeat to the Jayhawks, but looking at the big picture, it means a program cares as much about its future as its fans do.
Isn’t that all you can ever really ask for?

Following a six-game stretch during which USC scored just 14 runs, the Trojan bats have suddenly caught fire.
They’ve put 28 runs on the board in their last four games, including a 10-run outburst Tuesday against Loyola Marymount.
Hot at the plate · Senior second baseman Joe De Pinto had two hits, two RBIs and scored three runs in USC’s 10-3 rout of LMU at Dedeaux Field yesterday. The Trojans have been effective at the plate as of late, scoring 28 runs in their last four games. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
USC (11-18) jumped out in front early against USC interim coach Frank Cruz’s former squad. Junior center fielder Garret Houts reached on an error to lead off the game for the Trojans and advanced to second on a single. A few batters later, senior second baseman Joe De Pinto was hit by a pitch to load the bases with nobody out, paving the way for junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa’s sacrifice fly to left to put USC up 1-0.
After another single loaded the bases again, sophomore third baseman Adam Landecker hit what appeared to be an inning-ending double-play ball to shortstop.
The Lions (16-11) got the first out at second, but Jonathan Johnson threw the ball away trying to turn the double play, allowing junior catcher Kevin Roundtree and De Pinto to score, giving the Trojans a 3-0 lead after one inning.
The Lions got a pair back in the top of the second on a two-run single by first baseman Bret Dahlson, but that was all junior starter Brandon Garcia would allow for the next three innings.
Garcia held the Lions scoreless until the sixth, when he walked the leadoff hitter and was pulled after five-plus innings of solid work. That runner would score to give Garcia a final statline of three runs on five hits over five innings, striking out five and walking three.
“Garica gave us a nice outing,” Cruz said. “Probably one of his better starts of the season.”
Garcia was pleased with his start as well.
“As a Tuesday guy, you want to go five innings, maybe more,” Garcia said. “I got that done and the bullpen did the rest.”
USC added a run in the third when Oropesa smacked a double that one-hopped the wall in right-center, scoring De Pinto from first. The Trojans put up another in the fourth after De Pinto singled Houts home following a two-out triple.
The Trojans put the game out of reach in the sixth, when Roundtree whacked a two-out double. De Pinto followed that up with his second two-out RBI single of the day.
“It’s funny, because earlier in the season I felt I was hitting the ball hard and they were all being caught,” De Pinto said. “Now I don’t think I’m hitting them as well, but they’re finding the holes.”
Following an intentional walk of Oropesa, junior left fielder Matt Foat ripped a single to left-center that hopped past the Lions’ center fielder and rolled all the way to the wall, allowing De Pinto and Oropesa to trot home and give the Trojans an 8-3 lead.
“Two-out scoring is always important,” Cruz said. “That was really, really good to see.”
The Trojans added runs in both the seventh and eighth innings, the last run coming off a sacrifice fly by backup junior shortstop Ryan Bast — his first RBI of the season.
USC pitcher Austin Wood, who was knocked out of his Saturday start after only 19 pitches, came in for the ninth. The junior zipped it in to all four hitters he faced at a consistent 95 miles per hour and shut the door on the Trojans’ 10-3 win.
“I’ve been struggling a bit,” Wood said. “I haven’t been contributing as much as I wanted to. I just wanted to go out there, throw strikes and get my confidence back up.”
For the Trojans as a whole, confidence is growing.
“It’s been rare that we get good offense, good defense and good pitching in the same game,” De Pinto said. “But we got that today and hopefully we can use that as a springboard for this weekend.”
USC looks to continue its strong all-around play this weekend as it hosts No. 11 Stanford in a three-game series at Dedeaux Field.

For two weeks, New York City has come to USC. And “New York, New York [is] a helluva town.”
Tony Award winner director John Rubinstein portrays his vision of Leonard Bernstein’s musical On the Town at Bing Theatre, and performed by the School of Theatre, now in its last weekend.
Photo courtesy of the School of Theatre
The musical, Bernstein’s first Broadway score, was inspired by Jerome Robbins’ ballet Fancy Free. The book and lyrics were written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green.
Set during World War II, On the Town depicts the 24-hour leave of three sailors in New York City.
One sailor, Gabey (sophomore Matthew McFarland), falls for the girl of his dreams after seeing a photo on a subway of June’s “Miss Turnstiles.” The trio splits up as each attempts to find Gabey’s dream girl, Ivy Smith (senior Emma Chandler).
Gabey’s friends and fellow sailors, Chip (senior Mark Jacobson) and Ozzie (sophomore D.J. Blickenstaff), have adventures and find women of their own as they search for Ivy.
Chip meets the aggressive and strong-willed taxi driver Hildy (junior Adrienne Storrs), who eventually persuades him to go to her apartment.
Meanwhile, Ozzie visits a museum, where he meets the anthropologist Claire (junior Haley Fletcher), who occasionally gets “Carried Away” with men, though she is engaged to Judge Pitkin (freshman Cole Cuomo).
With less than 24 hours to spare, the couples spend time exploring New York City with one another.
The nearly three-hour-long production has the audience laughing throughout. The cast skillfully portrays each character’s personality, from bashful Chip to downhearted nightclub singer Señorita Dolores Dolores (senior Marina Lynn Macer).
The actors’ performances make the musical more than simple comedy, helping to create a romantic atmosphere.
Costume designer Manuel Prieto’s 1940s ensembles enhance the characters’ personalities as well as the romantic aspect of On the Town.
Ivy’s singing coach, Madame Dilly (freshman Madelyne Heyman), wears an asymmetrical dress with a handkerchief hem, appropriately fitting her dysfunctional lifestyle. Gabey’s various love interests dress in red, highlighting the musical’s romantic qualities.
The elegant and graceful dances choreographed by Lili Fuller express the emotions among the couples, as in “The Great Lover Displays Himself” and “Pas de Deux,” when Gabey imagines finding Ivy and dancing with her.
At other times, such as the scene in which the Museum of Natural History comes to life, the choreography prompts the audience’s laughter.
The costumes, choreography and lighting during “Lonely Town Pas de Deux” exemplify how well the elements of production work together in this musical. The lighting sets the stage for the dancers in their black and white attire with black umbrellas in hand. The dancers perform ballet as an expression of the loneliness felt when one is without love, even when surrounded by so many people in a big city.
Still, On the Town is not without its flaws. Scenic designer William Sammons’ staging for each scene typically consists of I-beam structures simply rearranged, which  quickly become eyesores and detract from the romantic quality of the musical.
In addition, projection designer Nick Santiago goes too far in his use of projections. The projections depict the dark tunnel through which the subway is traveling, the people and cars behind Hildy’s taxi as she drives, and the images of the New York landmarks Chip wants to visit. Unfortunately, the projections serve as distractions rather than complements.
On the Town is a well run production overall. It conveys Bernstein’s idea, influenced by World War II, that love must be taken advantage of while possible, even if it will only last for a short while.
Some elements take away from the romantic-comedy feel, but the audience leaves the theater in high spirits wanting to return for more.
Agree with trojanforlife. This review is pretty pathetic.
Can’t the DT get a theatre major to write these?  Or at least someone with some ability to actually review the cast and creative team without resorting to useless comments that boil down to: “the cast is good” and “the sets are bad?”  Andy Bernard may consider those comments worthy of a critic but I’d think the DT would strive for something more insightful than that…

College can be a stressful time, with the stress of everything from school to work to life in general. We often need time to relax and unwind, and sitcoms can provide the escape we all desire without taking too much time from our busy schedule.
With great sitcoms like Modern Family, Cougar Town, Community and Parks and Recreation bringing in high ratings, the current TV sitcom season has a lot to live up to. But whether you are looking for a comedy about culture clashes or a disparate family, the current season has a variety of offerings to help you get some productive relaxation.

LCD Soundsystem did just about everything right.
In the span of only six short years, the band basically accomplished all the things any aspiring rock band could possibly dream of achieving.
And now, the band has quit. After Saturday’s sold-out show at Madison Square Garden, LCD Soundsystem is no longer an active band.
Based on YouTube videos and reports, the concert was amazing.
The group ran through most of its discography and the show included guest appearances by musicians such as Arcade Fire’s Win Butler, Will Butler and Régine Chassagne.
As is obvious in the band’s shows, LCD Soundsystem is what fans call a disco-punk band. The band’s music includes many aspects of electronic and dance music, which set up its characteristic sound and garnered the members fame.
Through the last 40 years, disco has faded in and out of popularity. Nowadays, people can be found dancing to new and old disco and electronic records in clubs and venues around the world. Times change, and so do people’s musical preferences.
Although LCD Soundsystem borrowed much from its disco ancestors, it didn’t stick around long enough to watch itself lose relevance or recognition in the same way that the genre often does.
The band’s first single, “Losing My Edge,” included lyrics about how frontman James Murphy was losing his sense of coolness to a younger, hipper generation. But LCD Soundsystem never lost its edge.
The group released its first, self-titled album in 2005, which was nominated for a Grammy. Two years later the group released its follow-up album, Sound of Silver, which was also Grammy-nominated. Last year, the group released its third and final album, This Is Happening, which debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard charts.
The band has left behind some great things:
The “Drunk Girls” Video
Spike Jones ruined my favorite book with his film adaptation of Where The Wild Things Are, but he made up for it just a little bit by directing this video. “Drunk Girls” is by no means LCD’s best song, but the video is their most entertaining.
In the video, a group of people dressed in panda costumes terrorize the band members by covering them in a strange mixture of eggs, confetti, balloons, champagne and makeup as the band struggles through a rendition of the song.
One of the best single-shot videos I’ve ever seen.
The Giant Disco Ball
When LCD Soundsystem performs, the band does so under a giant disco ball. One the size of a boulder.
Disco occasionally slips out of popularity, but LCD Soundsystem proudly displays its love for the genre every time it performs.
James Murphy’s Personality
I’m usually a fan of jerk rockstars, the kinds of guys who act uninhibited onstage and don’t care what anyone thinks.
In other words, the Charlie Sheens of music.
LCD frontman James Murphy, humble, soft-spoken and reserved, is the opposite. At Coachella last year he repeatedly thanked the fans for coming to see the band and was giddy about sharing a stage with Jay-Z. He became outraged when tickets to his final show were scooped up by money-hungry scalpers, humbly tweeting fans shouldn’t pay the jacked-up prices just to see his band perform.
Although the nice guys of rock’n’roll like Murphy usually come off as trying too hard, Murphy seems genuine.
Hopefully, that personality will carry over into whatever musical endeavor he pursues next. For now (as Murphy sings in one of my favorite songs), someone great is gone.
As these and other great things about LCD Soundsystem prove, the band quit while it was ahead.
Band members didn’t experience any disagreements, angry break ups or cases of musical writer’s block.
They aren’t calling this an “indefinite hiatus,” á la the newly reunited Blink 182. They simply quit because they felt it was time.
This early departure calls to mind the numerous iconic and respected musical figures who have died young, such as 2Pac, Kurt Cobain and Jimi Hendrix.
These musicians died at the height of their fame without leaving time to fade from public consciousness.
LCD Soundsystem will be remembered in a similar manner not for its untimely death, but for its carefully timed retirement.
Quitting while you’re ahead is one of the hardest things to do, but also one of the smartest.  James Murphy is a smart man.
 
Will Hagle is a sophomore majoring in narrative studies. His column, “Feedback,” runs Wednesdays. 
Of course there was no fight, there is no band…it’s just James. He hires his friends to play with him for live shows, but he alone is lcdss.

Everyone’s favorite French robots are back, or so Disney Music would have you believe.
In light of Daft Punk’s recent Tron: Legacy score, the suits at the happiest ancillary merchandise factory on earth have compiled a truly bizarre sandwich of remixes, released yesterday as Tron: Legacy Reconfigured. 
Indie artists Pretty Lights, M83 and Boys Noize offer their own interpretations of Tron tracks, and bigger, more trance-associated names like Paul Oakenfold, Kaskade and Sander Kleinenberg round out the record.
Former Daft Punk manager Busy P, also the brain of Ed Banger records, made music headlines well before the album’s release, slamming the project as devoid of any involvement from “the Daft boys” and even suggesting those responsible for it are “apparently buying most of [their] electronic music in airports.”
Indeed, even the thought of mediocre Daft Punk being molded and mixed by Moby or The Crystal Method is enough to boil any house-purist’s blood.
Monsieur P is right to be angry. Tron: Legacy Reconfigured is an interminably choppy train wreck of borrowed taste and monetary aspirations.
There are two gems on the album. The best sound to be found here is Paul Oakenfold’s club remix of “C.L.U.”
The once murky antagonist theme receives intravenous steroidal therapy of fat beats, torturous buildups and fuzzy, modulated synths worthy of a Bloody Beetroots track.
Teddybears’ interpretation of the instantly forgettable “Adagio for Tron” is another surprise, wrapping tinny, glittering analog patches around the track’s conventionally mournful strings until they resemble the bleats of an arcade droid.
The remix is not a transformation as much as a sharpening of what remains one of the original soundtrack’s least compelling numbers.
Still, Tron: Legacy Reconfigured was an ill-advised undertaking, and that is painfully audible in the album’s other remixes.
The meticulous craft of the stronger Daft Punk tracks is battered and bruised by rough hands.
The Crystal Method eviscerates the mystery of “The Grid,” with abundant pitch bends and arpeggiated pads.
The Japanese Popstars reduce the majesty of “Arena” to a Casio-toned club filler. Even M83, which has rendered songs like Bloc Party’s “The Pioneers” epic and doom-filled, turns “Fall” into an ugly mash-up of sampled cries, piano chords and shoegaze feedback.
The Tron: Legacy soundtrack was far from the seat-thumping dance party many hoped for, though it had its moments of digital house-soaked bliss.
The bumping “End of Line,” the ballistic “Tron End Credits” and those described above were in no need of remixing to begin with.
The rest of the compilation alternates between monotony and monstrosity, but even at its occasional peaks Tron: Legacy Reconfigured is nothing but a shamefully baldfaced attempt by Disney executives to capitalize on the latest dubstep and hard house trends.
The baffling selection of remix artists is an obvious clue, as is the revealing lack of involvement from Daft Punk themselves.
That co-members Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo were presumably not invited or allowed to share their input on the remix album’s conception speaks to the dark nature of an entertainment giant like Disney.
It also suggests agreeing to score a Disney blockbuster at all might have been the worst artistic decision of Daft Punk’s career.
Unfortunately, the two do not seem to have considered this. They are currently preparing to release their own edition of the popular drink Coca Cola in France.
It’s sad to think the same men who made electronic music popular in both the FM radio and indie world, and captured the adoration of nearly every artist in the genre, have allowed their craft to be exploited and hotly privatized. (Good luck finding free streams of any of the remixes online.)
Should the duo ever decide to tour again, which would be a wise move at this point, I’d imagine we can look forward to enjoying a Daft Coke while we wait for the lasers to warm up.
 
 
There are several free streams of the songs online. You are a bit of a snobby douche.

College lessons I’ve learned
 
Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself is a book by Alan Alda I bought when the actor came to campus as part of Visions & Voices, and it encompasses some of the most valuable lessons I have learned in college.
Lesson No. 1: No one gets to be at the top by talking to themselves, but by learning from others.
Lesson No. 2: The valuable people receive full names; the bad ones, just initials. I could write many paragraphs complaining about people and situations that have annoyed me while at this university. I have learned that later, however, all of the bad things in our life become mere initials, while those people that truly matter fully last in our memories.
Thus, I will not write about L.L., Housing CSR, C.G. or J.T. Instead, I thank Kristy Morrell, Philip Placenti, Abel Delgado, Sharon Lavery, Michael Powers, Ed McCann, Amanda Foran and Margarita Cardenas. It is because of their devotion that thousands of students choose the Trojan family.
Lesson No. 3: The limits to our potential are not firmly set, they are simply self-imposed.
While USC was busy arguing about the infamous rooftop scandal, we were given another $15 million donation, and Friends and Neighbors Service Day took place on campus. If I had spent half my time helping these initiatives as I did reading banal articles on the pointy and sensitive subject, I would have done more for the community.
I never joined a fraternity because of personal convictions, yet I have always advocated for them. The expectations USC has of them are nothing compared to the potential that these institutions have to better the USC community. If Kappa Sigma had spent half of the time advertising Friends and Neighbors instead of trying to clean up its public image, I can assure you our neighborhood would look a lot better today. The next step rests on the shoulders of President C. L. Max Nikias. Hopefully he can once and for all reconcile the great academic path USC is taking with the moral responsibilities and potential of many of its inhabitants. He sure did it for me.

When Grandma Linton introduced me to her friends last weekend and told them I attended USC, I was mortified by their response: “Isn’t that the school where people had sex on the building?”
It seems recent high-profile scandals at USC have tainted what it means to be a Trojan — but even more concerning is that some students don’t seem to care. 
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
 
As a freshman spring admit, I spent all last fall imagining life at USC, and it was an idealized image I desperately wanted a taste of.
Now that I’m finally here, I’m disappointed in what I’ve seen.
Recent incidents have gone against the values of the Trojan family, a notion that carries heavy weight when students choose USC over other universities.
Sex in public? Moreover, on a roof that looks like you’d fall right through it if you weren’t skilled in scaling buildings? Not to mention the disgusting email that was blatantly misogynistic, racist and just plain crude.
Monday, as I was marching with other students around Tommy Trojan in protest of the university’s inadequate response to the viral email, I noticed countless students, both men and women, walking past us, laughing and pointing.
I found myself wondering if others actually find this all funny.
Later that day, for example, when I walked into class and excused myself for coming in late because of the protest, another student said, “This whole thing is being blown out of proportion. It’s just a joke. Chill out.”
I refuse to “chill out,” and I am disheartened any students would think this is the appropriate response.
Those speaking out against the email aren’t targeting Kappa Sigma, nor are they trying to shine a negative light on Greek life.
Instead, they are protesting a culture in which phrases such as “women are targets” are deemed funny and in which non-consent and rape are supposedly two different things.
Phrases like “tooting it and booting it” and that mindset create a cyclical monster of vacuity. Where did the meaning go? The respect?
This might seem like beating a dead horse, and chances are most students would prefer this issue died down so they can move on with their lives in blissful ignorance.
But before that can happen, we must examine our own ideologies and question if this culture of ours is acceptable, and if not, how we can change it.
I love USC. But the current negative atmosphere seems to permeate everything I do these days, and that’s definitely not what I expected when I got my acceptance letter.
If anything, we can consider this situation an opportunity for the student body to collaborate with the university to address the issues that have affecting our campus.
The student body needs to stop being so divided over this issue.
On one hand, you have upset feminists such as myself. On the other hand, you have the apathetic students who don’t really see the importance of the issue.
We will make no progress if I turn my nose up at those who don’t agree with me, just as nothing will be accomplished if those who are apathetic scoff at students, such as myself, who are speaking out.
We’re all being presented with a unique chance to revive the Trojan Family we hear of so often. Right now, I certainly don’t feel as if this is a family.
I’m in to fix this. Are you?
 
Mellissa Linton is a freshman majoring in English literature
Listen, SC doesn’t do “character-checks” prior to conferring admissions. Human beings are wildcards; you don’t know what you’re gonna get.  People are the same everywhere you go. I had TAs who attended Ivies as undergrads and cussed like sailors. One my TAs, who attended Princeton, was hot. She dressed so…owwhhhhh!!! I don’t wanna talk about it. I’m going to the bathroom…
I am very upset with the staff faculty, president Nikias and security department  where were you when this whole sex scandal
was happening   and the stupid moron that video taped  the sex in the roof  why did you have to tape that .
I work 3 jobs to pay for USC TUITION for my daughter  I sacrifice for her to attend this school which I thought  it was
a good choice of school  I  CONGRATULATE  Miss Linton for  writting this article for taking the time and the effort to tell the school the wrong doing of some students  .. the morning i got the LA TIMES and I read about the scandal I was so embarrased with my neighbors   I AM NOT PROUD TO BE A TROJAN PARENT        PRESIDENT   NIKIAS you have to do something about this problem……..  hire more security…. install cameras on building’s roof..   do something….. support this article writter… she seems to have what it takes to speak out…..
As a USC alumna, I agree.  Any time there is a scandal, that degree for which I worked so hard is devalued.  I want to show my resume and wear my cardinal and gold sweatshirt with pride. I shouldn’t need to defend my reputation or my work ethic, or have my accomplishments diminished.
USC is no longer the University of Spoiled Children.  President Sample worked very hard for that.  President Nikias is continuing along that path.  USC is not an Ivy, but it is one of the best schools on the west coast.  Current and future Trojans: don’t destroy the progress of those who came before you; don’t ruin it for yourselves; and don’t ruin it for those who will come after you.
“I found myself wondering if others actually find this all funny.”
Yup. I do. I laughed at you, pointed at you, made loud comments about you, and belligerently walked through your group. And in thirty years, when I walk by protestors who have nothing better to do than waste their time and obstruct my path, I’ll still be doing the same thing.
I hate to say it, but as USC students we don’t usually get the respect that we think we deserve. It seems as if the university standards are more about bringing in revenue (and student athletes that will assist in this endeavor) and less about cultivating the non-athletic students, who I’m sorry to say, will more likely impact the world (just based on numbers. This isn’t to say that student athletes go on to be unsuccessful, because that would be an untruth. But what I am saying is that the typical USC is not an athlete). I mean, what do you see on on television when USC is mentioned? Crime, large amounts of money donated, athletes, sport controversies and other things that sully the USC family reputation. Nikias’ induction and famous figures coming to campus is really the only truly good things that are depicted. But USC is not truly a school of “spoiled children;” I believe that the reason we are depicted this way is not just because of the supposed “wealth” of our student body, but our perceived attitudes as well.
To be honest, I’m not surprised that the Greek System would do something like this. In full disclosure, I would be shocked if the Frats and Sororities were all straight A students that never got in trouble and helped old ladies across the street. Across the country, Greek systems are known for rowdy partying and general stupidity. If the Greek system here bothers you too much, shut it down. But the real issue is how we want to be perceived to the rest of the world. Stop throwing a huge party whenever anyone gives you any large sum of money, it makes us look shallow and materialistic. Stop giving our athletes so much publicity. And for God’s sake stop bragging about how awesome USC is, it annoys all of the serious Universities–besides, we really don’t need to.
If we really are as awesome as we think we are (and as all of our faculty, diverse and hard-working students and staff is. And our history proves we are) then we don’t need to brag, out actions will draw praise from onlookers.  Why spend the time telling others how great you are when you peers can do it for you?
To be surprised…I’m surprised that everyone is surprised that the University is having issues…our priorities are all wrong…
good article though…
Bravo. One of the aims of a university education should be to teach students that “chill out” is an inappropriate response to incidents like this one.
First of all, sex on the roof is nothing new to modern college life.  Worse incidents have happened at Ivy League campuses and USC is no Ivy League!  We’re not a Stanford either.  USC has party time in its DNA and sometimes that spills over onto the public scene.  Every campus has their emotionally unintelligent and immature wingnuts and that’s just a fact of life.

In the sports world today, professional writers and fans have a tendency to irrationally overreact to hot starts and disappointing beginnings, choosing to make sweeping generalizations for the sake of a flashy column, article or tweet.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Consequently, many sports writers have essentially embraced a model of instant gratification, sacrificing good storytelling and concrete details. Writers might think they are appealing to fans through this model — and they might be right.
Slumps are a part of sports, and although they might have been previously accepted as part of the game, Twitter and 24/7 sports coverage have increased scrutiny of players and managers and, at times, forced both to make unreasonably reactionary decisions.
The problem is not limited to one sport. For example, when this season’s heavy preseason favorite,  the Miami Heat, began the season 9-8, “experts” who had chosen them to be the next NBA world champions immediately ate their words.
The Lakers have experienced similar struggles, enduring multiple losing streaks of three games or more. Writers and fans publicly questioned whether the Lakers needed to retool and trade the inconsistent Ron Artest.
General Manager Mitch Kupchak, however, ignored public grumbling and stayed the course. After making no moves, the Lakers are 18-2 since the All Star break and have re-established themselves as the clear favorites for the championship.
If the countless journalists and bloggers had their way, the Lakers would have given up franchise center Andrew Bynum for Carmelo Anthony for the sake of making a move.
Though some of these columnists were adamant the Lakers were just in a funk, others called for a complete rebuilding of the back-to-back defending champion Lakers.
What’s causing this reactionary trend is the impulsive nature of sports writing today. Many columns have abandoned nuance and subtlety, instead providing a reactionary viewpoint to grab the audience’s attention.
Often, writers are contrarians just to piss off fans and get them to read their stories.
Admittedly, it’s worked. Jason Whitlock has made a career of it, pushing his way to become one of Fox Sports’ most read reporters.
Moreover, the newfound ability to bypass the middleman (the editor) by way of social media has made this type of reactionary writing even easier and more widely followed.
Rather than crafting a story or making valid points like ESPN’s Wright Thompson or Buster Olney, most writers are taking the Whitlock route, leading sports writing down a dangerous, impulsive path — to the detriment of fans who remain loyal to professional writing by professional writers.
The Los Angeles Clippers will trail off, the Lakers will go deep into the postseason and everything will shake out the way it should.
But that won’t stop writers from going into hysterics when they see the Lakers’ winning streak snap  The commentary will clutter the front page of ESPN with headlines like “are the Lakers losing their edge?” Your Twitter timeline will have plenty of links to those articles, with writers promoting their new article that promises to expose the “real weaknesses of the Lakers.”
Sports articles are too often a ploy for readers’ attention. And although impulsive posts on one’s Twitter might generate publicity, soon enough fans will learn to distinguish credibility from absurdity.

This past week was an excellent one for Sum 41 fans residing in Los Angeles. The Canadian band performed three different free shows in the area followed by the filming of a music video which fans were invited to free of charge.
In intense promotion mode for their newest release, Screaming Bloody Murder, which came out March 29, the band performed two new songs that aired on Jimmy Kimmel Live on March 31. The first song was the title track from the record and the second song was entitled “Skumf*k.” Following these two songs, they played a mini-concert for the fans on the outdoor stage, which featured three older songs that did not air on television.
The following night, the band performed a Myspace Secret Show at Boardner’s in Hollywood, California, where the capacity was only 150 people. The band played a full headlining set and fans received free commemorative posters at the end of the evening.
On April 2, the band played yet another secret show for free on a small stage inside the Guitar Center in Hollywood and on April 3, the band filmed performance scenes with fans for an upcoming music video from the new record.
Now, the band will be taking a brief break in touring before heading to Japan in May and touring Europe all throughout the summer.
WOW!! I can’t wait to see the music video.

Swirling grey, the ominous night sky became scattered with light drizzle that drifted gently to the earth shortly before Black Star made their way on stage for the final act of the Paid Dues hip-hop festival. Was it foreshadowing for misfortune or a deliberate celestial intervention for the return of two of hip-hop’s greatest MC’s?

Talib Kweli and Mos Def required no introduction. The two hip-hop legends walked humbly toward center stage in rhythmic gait and floated to the top of a bass heavy hit with easy confidence. Or rather, a confidence that was seeded in both MC’s over ten years ago when they released their one and only collaborative album under the name Black Star.
Signed to Rawkus Records, Black Star released their debut album in 1998. They quickly gained attention in the underground and their music has become more widely appreciated since.  Both Mos Def and Talib Kweli have gone on to have solo careers, capturing a style and following each their own, but the energy put forth as a duo is like digging up buried treasure. Their music represents a by gone era. Two MC’s stuck in amber.
After performing the first song, neither wasted time to acknowledge the crowd and raised the energy immediately with their hard-hitting “Supreme, Supreme.” With a flow to match the lyrics, “Ghetto people it’s time to ride/ baby get involved go side to side,” the throng of loyal listeners were more than willing to sway left to right.
Where Mos Def is apt to use his upper register for melodies, you can expect Talib Kweli to rap with tact and precision. But just when you think you know what to expect, the two switch roles.
Black Star has a relationship where one will pick up where the other left off, giving listeners a continuous thread of head-bobbing hip hop alongside strong messages. To emphasize their roles in the group, in hand, Kweli had a black microphone while Mos Def had a red one. Kweli channeled the bass with reserved movement while Mos Def seemed to savor the attention a little more than Kweli, adding unique dance step to his lyrics.
A highlight of the set was when Talib Kweli’s “Get By” clattered through the speakers and settled like a thin cloud over the bursting crowd. “Get By” is an anthem that is immediately intoxicating. It is no wonder then that the beat was originally produced by a young Kanye West who sampled Nina Simone’s ‘Sinnerman to find resonance and power in a yearning chorus.
At one point in between songs, Mos Def asked the crowd if it would be okay if he did an acapella verse; as if the answer would be anything but a resounding yes. The crowd hollered back immediately and Mos Def began. The first lines found Mos using a slant rhyme to make the word ‘endorphins’ sound like ‘dolphins,’ a phenomenon he appropriately stopped to clarify before continuing. Not wanting to miss a word, the crowd fell silent and hung to every nuanced phrase and locked themselves into the rhythm of Mos Def’s genius use of cadence.
The set list wasn’t limited to music created under the name Black Star, but included highlights from the solo careers of both. At points, Mos Def would take a verse from a Talib Kweli song and Talib would make a Mos Def verse his own, showing that their knowledge of each other went beyond their time spent together as Black Star. The set also included several snippets of songs yet to come on what is rumored to be a second Black Star album that will be produced by underground hip-hop legend Madlib.
In the middle of Mos Def’s ‘Auditorium,’ Mos had the DJ cut the music so he could adjust his levels. “Pardon me for being a perfectionist” he pleaded to the crowd. All were patient while Mos Def and Talib Kweli adjusted for what would be a memorable performance that carried on into the night.
The Paid Dues festival, which took place at the National Orange Show Events Center in San Bernadino on Saturday night saw a myriad of big names in hip hop perform including Immortal Technique, Murs, Dead Prez, and Black Star who filled the headlining role. Black Star’s performance was the climax of a long day of hip-hop and seemed to encapsulate the shared sentiments of the festival, which was one of deep appreciation.
