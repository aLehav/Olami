Former USC soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin will plead guilty to racketeering conspiracy charges and cooperate with the “Operation Varsity Blues” investigation by June 30, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Khosroshahin, who recruited students to the USC women’s soccer team in exchange for high-dollar payments, signed a cooperation agreement offering new information to prosecutors about the case in hopes of receiving a lesser sentence.
William “Rick” Singer, the mastermind of the scheme, paid over $350,000 to a private soccer club run by Khosroshahin and Laura Janke, a former USC women’s assistant soccer coach who pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy last month, according to court indictments. Janke and Khosroshahin recruited four of Singer’s clients’ children for the USC women’s soccer team, even though they never played soccer competitively, in exchange for the payments. 
Khosroshahin also sent fake athletic profiles to former UCLA men’s soccer coach Jorge Salcedo in 2016. In another case, Khosroshahin and Janke received $50,000 for their club from Toby MacFarlane, who pleaded guilty to mail fraud conspiracy and honest services mail fraud in late April, after they helped his daughter get into USC. 
Janke and Khosroshahin are ordered to forfeit $356,047 in the form of a money judgment, according to court documents. Khosroshahin is also separately ordered to forfeit $75,000. 
Although Khosroshahin initially pleaded not guilty, he then entered into a proffer agreement on April 22, allowing him to disclose facts about the scheme without further incriminating himself, before his guilty plea this month. 
Due to his cooperation, prosecutors recommended Khosroshahin be sentenced to 46 to 57 months in prison, according to the Times. Prosecutors can recommend lower guidelines if he provides information that adds to the case.
Lawyers representing USC parents Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli, among others implicated in the investigation, were also present at the status conference (a pre-trial procedural meeting).
Loughlin and Giannulli have both pleaded not guilty to charges of mail and wire fraud conspiracy, honest services mail and wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges. Their attorneys outlined a potential defense strategy, which claims that the alleged bribes were actually donations to the University. 
Loughlin could face up to 40 years in prison for her charges, according to BuzzFeed. She and her husband were accused of paying $500,000 to get their daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose, into USC as crew team recruits, despite them never playing the sport.
A second status conference is set for Oct. 2.

After its recent success in the NCAA West Preliminary Championships, the USC track and field program will send 18 athletes to the NCAA Championships Wednesday in Austin, Texas.
The Trojans entered the postseason as one of the strongest overall in the nation. In the Pac-12 Championships, the women’s team came away with first place, while the men took fifth.
The men’s team is currently ranked No. 9 in the nation and will field eight athletes, including Ayden Owens for decathlon, who snatched the Male Pac-12 Freshman of the Year distinction this year. He was the only male Trojan to earn a Pac-12 award. At 6-foot-2-inches, Owens became the Gatorade Pennsylvania Men’s Track and Field Athlete of the Year during his senior year of high school. 
In his first season as a Trojan, Owens posted unprecedented numbers. He ran the 100-meter dash in 10.43 seconds, completed the 110-meter hurdle in 13.76 seconds, and achieved a 24-foot-8-inch long jump, all top five marks for USC. The men’s team hopes Owen continues his success and bring home a championship win for the program.
Other athletes competing include freshman Eric Allen Jr. for the 200-meter sprint, sophomores Cameron Samuel for hurdles and Earnest Sears III for the high jump; junior Isaiah Jewett for the 800-meter sprint; redshirt juniors Nathan Bultman with the hammer throw and Matthew Katnik for shot put; and senior Marquis Morris with the 110 hurdles.
The No. 2 women’s team will send ten athletes to this week’s championship, including junior Anna Cockrell for the 100- and 400-meter hurdles. Cockrell won the 200-meter title and placed second for the 400-meter hurdles at last year’s NCAA Championships.
Cockrell has been particularly valuable for the women’s team, acting as its anchor throughout the 15-meet-long regular season. However, she admits that her career as a Trojan has not always been easy.
“My body felt like it was in a car accident when I first started training at USC,” Cockrell told USC Athletics.
However, it was not long before Cockrell established herself as a force to be reckoned with. She was on the 4×400 team that won in a miraculous comeback during the 2018 NCAA Championships. 
Cockrell credits coach Caryl Smith Gilbert for helping her overcome her hamstring injury during the last indoor season, allowing her to improve her performance both physically and mentally upon return.
“Coach Caryl has pushed me hard from the moment I stepped on campus and she recognizes potential in people to achieve their goals.” Cockrell said. “She knew I could get through the injury and that kept me going.”
Cockrell boasts a number of accolades outside of track. She spoke at USC’s student-athlete graduation in May and is preparing to begin her graduate studies in Public Policy.
“I’m ready and I’m tired of second place,” Cockrell said regarding this season’s championships. “I’ve been an All-American every year I’ve been here and that’s something I’m proud of, but I’m ready for an individual championship.”
Other women competing in the NCAA Championships include freshmen Bailey Lear with the 4×400 relay and Lanae-Tava Thomas with the 100 and 200 sprints; sophomores Chanel Brissett for the 100 hurdles,  Kaelin Roberts as an alternate for the 4×400; and TeeTee Terry with the 100 and 200 sprints; juniors Kyra Constantine for the 400 sprint and Mecca McGlaston as an alternate for the 4×100 and 4×400 relays; redshirt junior Angie Annelus for the 100 and 200 sprints; and senior Margaux Jones with the long jump.
Both the men’s and women’s teams have come a long way and both hope to add a coveted championship banner when all is done. 
The NCAA Championships will be held Wednesday through Saturday in Austin, Texas.

Perched along a busy street in East Los Angeles, surrounded by warehouses and apartment buildings, nestled inside an unassuming food truck, is the single best taco I have ever had. 
Mariscos Jalisco is a far cry from the standard Los Angeles food truck — the car is adorned with a single, humble logo, unlike the visual overload of brightly-colored modern trucks slinging trendy food in L.A.’s hipster neighborhoods. In many ways, Mariscos Jalisco is no different from the average lonchera, serving low-cost Mexican food to a mostly Latinx neighborhood. 
However, Mariscos Jalisco eclipses the definition of lonchera with a swift drizzle of fresh salsa.
Underneath a layer of chilled, spiced tomatoes and sliced avocados sits a steaming, crackling taco, freshly fried. The first bite gives way with a loud crunch, the taste of toasted corn tortilla and earthy avocado supporting a mouth-watering filling of soft shrimp. The salsa and avocado work in tandem to balance out the physical heat of the taco, fresh from the fryer (which likely burnt your tongue on impact, but you won’t mind because the taco is just that good). 
Beyond the tacos de camarones, Mariscos Jalisco sells a variety of seafood: Shrimp coctél drowning in flavorful sauce, tostadas piled high with ceviche, mouth-scorching aguachile — all executed with great craft and care. Only a select few work inside the truck, guarding owner Raul Ortega’s shrimp taco recipe from eager eyes. 
For eighteen years now, Mariscos Jalisco has perfected and sold its trademark tacos, which have won competitions and occupied high ranks on many best taco lists. It sat square on Jonathan Gold’s latest 101 Restaurants list, as it had for many years prior and recently received a Michelin Bib Gourmet award. There is no debate: Mariscos Jalisco is excellent, and the city is well aware of it.
Much like the way Mariscos Jalisco transcends its food truck exterior, it also transcends local interest. Because of its well-deserved fame, Mariscos attracts visitors from all areas of Southern California, prompting hour-plus pilgrimages to try the famous shrimp tacos. 
For many, this is their first time ever nearing Boyle Heights, a neighborhood shaped by constant battles against government erasure and gentrification.
Across decades, Boyle Heights has fostered a Latinx community focused on cultural preservation and survival. Now, as population and housing costs rise, the rest of the city has begun to creep into East L.A., replacing low-income housing with expensive studio apartments and displacing neighborhoods like Boyle Heights. 
The neighborhoods are now dotted with art galleries and artisanal coffee shops, a tell-tale sign that gentrification is already underway. Groups like Defend Boyle Heights and the Boyle Heights Alliance Against Artwashing and Displacement are actively working to remove gallery spaces and white business from the area, sometimes resorting to violence and graffiti to make their message clear — wealthier people, and the displacement they bring with them, are not welcome. 
Peering through the reviews on the Mariscos Jalisco Yelp page, a similar pattern emerges: “The area was kind of sketchy, but the tacos are great!”
 Having a restaurant as profound as Mariscos Jalisco deep in East L.A. is likely a matter of pride to its community, and I am always eager to introduce new people to the most unique and delicious tacos in Los Angeles. However, as more and more white people flock to the area — be it for food, or art, or cultural sightseeing — it is important to consider the people that fostered it. 
I try to be mindful about where I am spending my money in Boyle Heights — am I contributing to the community or the community’s displacement?

Daily Trojan file photo
Head baseball coach Dan Hubbs’ contract will not be renewed after it expires at the end of June, Athletic Director Lynn Swann announced Wednesday.
The decision to terminate Hubbs’ contract comes on the heels of a 25-29-1 season for the Trojans. Despite having won 12 national championships in its storied history, USC missed the postseason for the fourth consecutive year and has not had a winning season since 2015.
“I am grateful for all the opportunities I have had here the last seven years,” Hubbs said in a statement.
In 2015, the Trojans went 39-21 and were eliminated in the regional round of the postseason by eventual champion Virginia. But the following season, USC finished at an even 28-28, despite a roster packed with 12 players selected for the 2016 MLB Draft.
 USC hasn’t been able to fix its path since, finishing with a losing record in the last three seasons.
 “We have a very successful and proud baseball tradition at USC,” Swann said in a statement. “We now look forward to the next chapter of USC baseball under new leadership.”
Swann said that the search for Hubbs’ successor will begin immediately.
 In 2013, Hubbs was promoted from associate head coach to head coach of the Trojans squad and has been at the helm since. He served in the role for seven years, compiling a losing 188-200-1 overall record and finishing in the top four of the Pac-12 standings twice.
 “We want to thank [Hubbs] for his effort and service,” Swann said. “[Hubbs] is a good man and a good coach, and he always will be a great Trojan. However, we felt that after seven years under [Hubbs], our program needed new leadership and direction.” 
 Hubbs played for USC as a student. He pitched for the Trojans from 1991 to 1993, amassing a 19-13 record as a pitcher in 81 appearances. Hubbs ranks fourth on the all-time Trojans saves list and played seven years in the minor leagues with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies organizations. 
“Seeing my players’ success on the field, in the classroom and in their own lives after they left USC was always my greatest reward,” Hubbs said. “I look forward to watching their continued success as I remain part of the Trojan Family.”
Hubbs’ release boiled down to a lack of results on the field for the Trojans over the last few years, especially in 2019. This year, USC’s offense ranked No. 201 in the country in runs scored, featuring just one batter (junior outfielder Matthew Acosta) with a batting average above .300. The pitching staff also put together an underwhelming 4.63 ERA on the season. 
The Trojans showed flashes of promise this season, picking up impressive wins over Arkansas, UCLA, Stanford and Oregon State but failed to sustain success over the long run.
USC has won twice as many national championships as any other Division I program but has not reached the College World Series since 2001 and hasn’t hoisted the trophy since 1998. 
Swann will try to bring the Trojans back to their winning ways, hoping that the next head coach will be the one to turn the tide for USC.

With the goal of creating a valuable platform to sell and exchange products on campus, two freshmen in the World Bachelor Business Program launched Agora, a streamlined marketplace for USC students, in Spring 2019. The website lets USC students sell and exchange goods on campus.
Since Jacob Pielke and Ethan Aspin are leaving USC to study in Hong Kong as part of the WBB program, the duo wanted to make an impact on the University by using their entrepreneurship skills to benefit students.
“We both had similar [ideas] and thought this was a platform that was needed — so we decided to make it ourselves,” Pielke said. “We saw some great user growth and retention, but we are ending our beta platform at the end of this month to begin working on our next platform over the summer.”
The beta version of Agora was launched as a minimum value product to test the market. The creators found that Agora was valuable to the USC community and hope to scale it up in the second version by improving marketing strategies.
“Marketing is something I personally neglected in the beginning, but I’ve come to realize its importance because it promotes your platform,” Aspin said. “We were featured on the Instagram page for our World Bachelor Business Program. They’ve helped us with publicizing Agora, and we’ve been marketing by posting stories on Instagram and Snapchat.” 
Pielke said that the Agora team’s goals include streamlining the whole experience, improving user interaction within the site and potentially developing an app. 
“Long term, we are hoping to expand to other universities around the U.S., but that’s much further down the line,” Aspin said. “Agora is a niche market because it is safe, reliable and trustworthy unlike platforms such as Craigslist. By providing something specialized for campuses, we are creating a reliable platform because students feel safer selling to each other.”
Pielke and Aspin manage the day-to-day operations for Agora. 
The two occasionally reach out to members of the WBB and entrepreneurs from Blackstone Launchpad, a campus resource that offers individualized coaching to student entrepreneurs for advice on how to improve marketing strategies, increase user retention and publicize the creation. 
Although both are studying business, Pielke focuses on coding and development while Ethan specializes in Photoshop and design. 
“Nowadays, businesses need specialists from every field to contribute to the one project and create something valuable.” Aspin said.
Aspin said entrepreneurship comes with a lot of responsibility.  
“Creating a business is a lot harder than one may think,” Aspin said. “You have to put all the aspects you learn from business administration into one package, which is something people tend to forget. When most people think of entrepreneurship, they think of new ideas and ignore everything else that goes into it.”

“You gotta kill the person you were born to be and become the person you were meant to be,” a singer tells Reginald Dwight in “Rocketman.” Dwight, an aspiring pianist from England playing backup for soul artists, soon decided he needed a stage name. Elton John seemed to have a nice ring to it. 
“Rocketman” is based on the true story of singer Elton John’s ascent to stardom. The exciting, unpredictable tone of the entire film is established from the start when Elton, played by Taron Egerton, shows up to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting wearing a bedazzled devil outfit with feathered wings. Throughout that meeting, Elton shares the story of his life: From troubled childhood to sudden fame. 
“Rocketman” is told as a musical. Unlike many music biographies, the film embraces the extravagant style the singer is known for and infuses it into every stylistic choice — turning what could have been a predictable, formulaic tale into an refreshin, empathetic experience. 
The story is primarily told through the lens of various important relationships in the singer’s life. As a young and talented pianist, Reginald Dwight used music as a way to feel loved, as he did not have the loving relationship he craved from his father. 
However, a crucial relationship Elton developed was with his best friend and collaborator, Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell). Taupin and Elton hit it off in their very first meeting: After moving in together, Taupin becomes responsible for iconic hits that propel Elton to stardom. Early in their career, when their manager senses they have something Lennon-and-McCartney-esque, they are sent to perform in the U.S. at the Troubadour — a performance the film portrays as ethereal and (literally) groundbreaking. It forever changes their lives.
Egerton is the centerpiece that drives “Rocketman” forward, but the film is also lifted up by its supporting cast. Bryce Dallas Howard portrays Elton’s mother, someone who loves her son but neglects and becomes disappointed in him, namely because  he is gay — she argues that he is choosing to lead a lonely life where no one will love him. This interaction is the catalyst for Elton’s increasing drug and alcohol use. He passionately searches for what he cannot find but truly craves: love from another human being. 
Another influential character was Elton’s life was his manager John Reid, suavely played by Richard Madden; a wise manager but dishonest lover, Reid helps Elton come to terms with his sexuality. Despite their romantic relationship, Reid constantly has flings with other people on the road, upsetting Elton and making him feel used.
The singer’s tale of love won and lost is heartbreaking — “Rocketman” documents it in a stylistic but melancholic fashion as Elton plummets further into his addictions, anger and despair. 
It isn’t until the end of the movie, when he dreams of his friend Bernie telling him that he has always loved him and sees himself hugging a young Reginald Dwight, that Elton finally becomes content with himself. It’s a cathartic conclusion that reveals  the most important relationship Elton needed to fix — the one with himself.
Despite its exuberant, musical vibrancy, “Rocketman” does not sugarcoat the icon’s struggles and human imperfections. The film creatively sends a message that love is what everyone deeply craves.

USC is well known for having a diverse student body, with recent student demographic records indicating that nearly 70 percent of students come from an underrepresented ethnic or racial group. With that ethnic diversity also comes cultural and religious variety. Because of that, the University must accommodate all religions by not holding classes on major religious holidays. 
The Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr took place on June 3 and 4 this week — as did USC summer classes. This overlap forces Muslim students taking summer classes to make an unfair choice: Attend class and miss an important religious event, or celebrate Eid and miss class. 
USC’s calendar, like most educational institutions, is conveniently designed to fit around Christian holidays like Christmas. Similar holidays in other religions, such as the Jewish Yom Kippur or the Islamic Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr, aren’t afforded the same consideration. 
Given its commitment to diversity, USC should not hold classes during Islamic and Jewish holidays so that students can practice their religion with loved ones without being burdened by falling behind in classes.
Currently, USC’s policy on holy days grants students excused absences and allows them to make up work missed during a religious holiday. The policy also encourages professors to avoid scheduling exams on major holidays but does not require doing so. Religious students are expected to work around their holidays to meet class demands, when the burden should instead lie on the University. 
Changing the academic calendar to fit all students’ needs would reaffirm USC’s acceptance of these communities. By giving these holidays the same weight as Christian holidays, the University can set the precedent that all religions are well-respected by the institution. 
Students shouldn’t have to choose between honoring the most sacred days of their religion and attending school.
Even though USC has policies requiring that professors excuse religious absences, many USC students may still feel compelled to go to class instead of religious services because they fear that they might fall behind. 
Rather than recognizing Islamic and Jewish holidays, many schools have instead responded to complaints by removing all of the names of religious holidays — including Christmas — from the academic schedule, despite their schedules still being created around these holidays. 
One way to address the conflicts, professors should at least create class time schedules that are sensitive to religious holidays. While changing a traditional university schedule may seem logistically difficult, if USC truly cares about preserving religious freedom for its surrounding community, professors and administrators, it would find a way to accommodate religious holidays so that students are not forced to choose between their religion and their schoolwork. 
The United States has major populations of both Muslims and Jews; according to the Pew Research Center, there are 5.7 million practicing Jews and 3.85 million Muslims in the country. These religions, along with others practiced in America, are not treated as equal to Christianity in most education systems’ calendars. By better accommodating these religions, USC can lead the charge for higher education institutions to show their commitment to religious diversity.
As a university that prides itself on a commitment to diversity, there is no reason for USC not to recognize Muslim and Jewish holidays in its academic calendar.

When news first broke about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last February, Tiana Lyew, who grew up in Coral Springs, Fla. was crushed. 
“It was terrible — one of the worst days of my life,” said Lyew, a senior majoring in public relations. “I walked home and cried.” 
While Lyew was always interested in politics, this personal tragedy motivated her to become more involved in the political process. Lyew said that after the shooting in Parkland, she knew she could not remain complacent about political issues.
“I don’t have the privilege of ignoring these issues anymore,” Lyew said. “Now, absolutely every part of my life is affected by politics. I thought it was important, so I decided to go into politics after that officially.”
This summer, Lyew is interning at the office of U.S. Senator Kamala Harris. Harris was elected to serve as California’s senator in 2016, following six years of service as California’s Attorney General. Today, Harris is a high-profile 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. While the Senator’s political career began in her hometown of Oakland, Calif., Lyew’s story began over 3000 miles away. 
Lyew was born in Jamaica to her parents, Dave Lyew and Moya Lopez-Lyew, where Harris’ father also grew up. The couple moved to the United States shortly after Tiana was born. Growing up, Lyew especially looked up to her mother as role model.
“She’s really hard-working and I’ve always been inspired by her,” Lyew said. “I think I got my work ethic and my compassion for other people from her.” 
By the time Lyew was a junior in high school, she knew she wanted to attend USC. Lyew said she chose to study at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism because of its unparalleled reputation and academic rigor.
After a summer internship at the Los Angeles office of Paul Hastings LLP, an international law firm, Lyew accepted an opportunity to serve as a press intern for the Office of California Attorney General Xavier Beccera. 
At Beccera’s office, Lyew drafted speeches and press releases to represent state and immigrant community’s concerns in California. She said her upbringing in an immigrant household was crucial toward her developing the ability to effectively communicate the community’s needs.
“I think that understanding that immigrants are so integral to this country and that they do pay taxes and that they contribute to society in incredible ways … does absolute wonders in helping these communities” Lyew said. 
After the fall internship, Lyew used the latter half of her junior year to participate in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Washington D.C. program. The program allowed Lyew to take classes in the evening while pursuing a full-time press internship at the office of U.S. Senator Jon Tester.
As part of the internship, Lyew conducted correspondence with Tester’s constituents, learning how to communicate with people she strongly disagreed with over hot button issues such as gun control and abortion. 
“I think it’s extremely important for young people to participate in politics, especially for the future of the Democratic Party,” Lyew said. “I definitely believe that the reason for most of the success in the 2018 midterm elections is that young people were finally motivated to go out and vote. But — regardless of party — it’s important for young people to feel as if our ideas and preferred policies are listened to as well. It affects our future more than anyone else’s.”
Director of Graduate Admissions at Annenberg Valerie Friday Jones, who has worked with Lyew, said she is excited to see what is in store for Lyew’s future. 
“She has balanced academic excellence, extracurricular activities and a part-time job with aplomb, all of which will serve her well in Senator Harris’ office,” Jones said. 
Lyew said she is also currently considering working for a 2020 presidential campaign. After graduating, the senior hopes to attend law school and ultimately pursue a career in public service.

The Los Angeles Rams have entered their final week of organized team activities to prepare for the upcoming NFL season. While this early offseason preparation marks the start of the team’s quest to return to the Super Bowl, possibly the most significant aspect is who is missing: most importantly among that group, star running back Todd Gurley. 
Gurley has been a subject of mystery and concern for the last several months. In this year’s Super Bowl, the three-time pro-bowler received only 10 carries — just three more than supposed backup CJ Anderson — after a season in which Gurley took on a large portion of the Rams’ offensive duties. The number of touches was underwhelming and seemed inexplicable, given the obvious stakes and the team’s offensive woes at the time. 
After the game, Gurley maintained that he was healthy. But months later, The Athletic reporter Jeff Howe revealed that Gurley had arthritis in his left knee. 
For Rams fans, news of Gurley’s condition brought both welcome clarity and immense concern. 
On the positive side, head coach Sean McVay’s sanity was reaffirmed. Gurley’s lack of touches during the Super Bowl was bewildering, and McVay provided little explanation. However, the future of the Rams’ former NFL Offensive MVP is reason for concern.
Gurley, 24, is no stranger to knee injuries. Despite tearing his ACL in 2014 at the University of Georgia, Gurley was drafted 10th overall in the 2015 NFL Draft and garnered Rookie of the Year honors. He didn’t look back for the following three seasons until pain in the same knee sidelined him at the end of 2018 and limited him for the rest of the Rams’ postseason run. 
That’s the problem. Gurley’s surgically repaired left knee does not appear to have fully recovered from 2014. 
In fact, it’s getting worse. 
In an article on Rams Wire, Jesse Morse, a specialist in musculoskeletal injuries and arthritis at Florida Orthopedic Specialists, wrote that though Gurley could still be productive in the future, his peak is likely well in the past. 
Last month, Gurley would not confirm nor deny whether he had a degenerative knee condition. The Rams appear to have already begun to take cautionary action.
After Howe reported on Gurley’s arthritis in March, McVay indicated that the team was considering a stem cell procedure to treat Gurley’s injury. The treatment would involve injecting bone marrow from his pelvis into the affected area of his knee, which would work as an anti-inflammatory to help accelerate the healing process. The treatment usually requires several weeks of recovery.
Evidently, the 24-year-old’s future is now a significant question mark. 
The team’s apparent concern for Gurley’s injury was further demonstrated by their second selection in May’s draft. The Rams traded up 24 spots to select Memphis’s Darrell Henderson, a versatile, workhorse type of back with a skillset similar to Gurley’s. 
Teams do not usually sacrifice draft capital that early unless they feel a glaring need to do so. 
The long-term financial consequences of Gurley’s condition are even more alarming for the Rams. Gurley signed a four-year, $57.5 million contract extension with the team before the season. 
That’s a major cap hit, and if Gurley can’t play, he could become a deadweight loss of almost $15 million per year. Given that the median salary for an NFL player is approximately $860,000, the Rams would lose out on the opportunity to sign numerous players who could add depth to their roster.
Considering the Rams’ spending spree during the prior season and the sizeable extension quarterback Jared Goff is likely to receive, the deal may severely limit the organization’s flexibility in years to come. 
Despite all the concern surrounding Gurley’s knee, the Rams’ offseason has been a quiet success. Releasing safety Mark Barron shaved $6.33 million off the team’s financial commitments. Acquisitions of veterans Eric Weddle and Clay Matthews, coupled with a strong draft class, leave much to be hopeful for. 
Still, the reality of the star running back’s fragility remains.
For a team that hopes to compete for a championship this season, Gurley’s knee is Rams fans’ biggest concern.

As news of the nationwide college admissions bribery case and the celebrity stars involved continue to flood nightly newscasts and Facebook feeds months after the college admissions scandal was first made public, both the media and the USC administration are having trouble focusing on much else. 
Articles examining the struggles of first-generation college students go unnoticed, yet gossip tabloid headlines about Lori Loughlin, often referred to by her Full House character’s name, Aunt Becky, and her daughter, Olivia Jade, persist. 
USC heavily markets itself as a university committed to supporting underprivileged students and increasing diversity. But as the din of countless administrative scandals grows increasingly cacophonous, the voices of societally marginalized students continue to be overshadowed and unheard. 
While USC has promoted its efforts to support low-income and first generation students, such as the establishment of a food pantry for food insecure students, these efforts are largely equivalent to placing a Band-Aid on a wound in need of stitches. First-generation and low-income students need extra support from the moment they get to campus, yet the University fails to meet those needs. 
USC prides itself as an institution that is committed to “supporting access for students from diverse backgrounds” — while the University’s Class of 2022 has an estimated 578 first-generation students, once they get here, many find a lack of understanding and guidance. 
Katy Figueroa, a rising sophomore and QuestBridge scholar, said USC didn’t meet her expectations as a first-generation student.
 “I already knew that college would be hard, but I thought that USC would help me sustain myself while at college and take the financial burden off my family,” Figueroa said. “On the contrary, I have not felt that USC has informed me about resources, or … even provided them. As USC tries to cover up their issues, I’ve felt even more neglected.”
The struggles and concerns of first-generation and low-income students have become something of a side plot to the self-inflicted plight of those who have bribed or donated their way into the University. USC has become so concerned with maintaining its pristine image during a time when scandals plague the University that it has forgotten to take care of its most vulnerable students. 
First-generation students walk blindly into outrageously expensive institutions like USC without the financial security they need. It’s the University’s duty to support these students, instead of focusing on the poor decisions made by the ultra-rich. 
This is an issue not only within the University administration, but in the media and public as well. Instead of continuing to cover the admission scandal on what seems to be a weekly, if not daily basis, major newspapers and media websites should focus their attention on covering the stories of first-generation students who had to work twice as hard to get into college, yet don’t receive the necessary support once they’re there. 
While the attention of both the administration and the public continues to jump from one trending scandal to the next, colleges around the country are held unaccountable for their lack of support for underprivileged students. Despite having plenty of funding, a number of colleges instead choose to ignore the wellbeing of their students to protect a flimsy facade of prestige. 
The widely accepted stereotype of ultra-rich parents getting their children into college through bribes or “donations” is finally getting its comeuppance. But there’s another stereotype that higher education institutions must address: the broke college student. 
While it’s often played off as a joke, it’s a real concern for food-insecure, housing-insecure and financially insecure students. Their concerns matter a whole lot more than whether or not the Giannulli sisters will continue to attend USC.
