Draped in sequin-coated suits of armor and exploding with provocative, rollicking humor, three drag queens from Australia set out to conquer the Australian Outback. With every conceivable surface covered with colored lights and furry accessories, Priscilla Queen of the Desert: The Musical has ended its run at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood after an extensive North American tour, including more than 500 performances on Broadway. The show will next tour in Sweden, Italy, Ireland and the U.K.

This story of two drag queens and a transsexual on an unforgettable road trip combines the details of an everlasting friendship, love without barriers and laughs set to a number of famous karaoke songs. On top of the award-winning costumes and catchy tunes, the story recounts the everyday struggles of homosexual men.
Adapted from the 1994 film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, which was written and directed by Stephan Elliot and starred Terence Stamp, Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce, the musical incorporates elements of mainstream comedy and rich costumes to appeal to a wider audience. Where the film accentuated passive humor and the characters’ vulnerability, the theatrical performance emphasizes the flamboyance of the outlandish drag lifestyle that the characters follow.
Despite the outrageously exuberant costumes, the plot is relatively simple. The main character, Tick, a drag queen played by Wade McCollum, is convinced by his wife Marion (Christy Faber) to travel to a town in the middle of the Australian desert in order to perform on the stage of a local casino and finally meet his young son Benji (Will B.), who is unaware of his father’s unconventional lifestyle.
Faced with a pivotal decision and apprehensive about his future encounter with his son, Tick enlists the help of his two good friends, Felicia (Bryan West) and Bernadette (Scott Willis), who just so happen to be fiery rivals on the stage of glamour. Bernadette constantly reminisces about her young days as a headlining lip-syncher, and Felicia, an aspiring drag queen star with impetuous tendencies, decide to accompany Tick on a journey full of surprises and unexpected heart. The trio finds themselves running from old country hillbillies and violent homophobes, all while strutting in glittering 3-inch stilettos.
The music consists entirely of jukebox oldies, evocative of the 1980s disco days when Diana Ross rocked the crowd with classics such as “It’s Raining Men” and “I Will Survive.” With an earful of lyrics familiar to generations of listeners, the musical is a happily reminiscent memory of the striking art and expression once present in the world of underground disco.
Perhaps the most noticeable facet of the ostentatious performances are Tim Chappel and Lizzy Gardiner’s Tony award-winning costumes. Aiming for the bigger and better, the designs for the musical consist of grand ensembles that illuminate the stage with sheer dimension and lavish imagination. From multi-layered cake gowns to a colorful assortment of dessert-inspired pieces, the Priscilla closet is a collection of clothing straight out of a tacky parade.
The show has its heart-rending moments, as well. As the trio embarks on their journey, they are unprepared for the dark world of intolerance outside their powdery, pink dressing rooms. Of the three, it is Felicia, in all her careless glory, who discovers that injustice is the road to expressing one’s true self. Similarly, Bernadette finds herself with an entirely new gender, and an entirely unexpected friend. These surprises aren’t terribly ill-fated, as they match nicely with the assertive and boisterous natures of the three main characters. All in all, the trio escapes these situations with their dignity and poise intact.
What Priscilla lacks in provoking emotion, it compensates in fabulous splendor, combining upbeat music, smooth choreography and a multi-talented army of actors that is bound to make the night worthwhile.
The musical is truly a celebration of acceptance and staying true to oneself.

Glitter. Glamor. Grunge. L.A.-based musician Alexandra Starlight brings a new kind of sparkle to the rock world with her smooth vocals in her latest EP, Alexandra & the Starlight Band.
Starlight radiates with her effervescent personality. Her giggly, upbeat attitude in conversation is captivating. But at the same time, she manages to possess a sense of maturity reflective of more seasoned musicians.
“Honesty as an artist is so important. It is one of those things where the truth will never be overlooked,” she said.  “It’s like The Old Man and the Sea. If you go out everyday and put your line out there, you may not catch a fish. But your boat of truths will make something catch a bite eventually.”
Starlight owes her outlook on life as well as her musical talents to her upbringing. Growing up in the bustling expanse of Oakland, Calif., Starlight had an affinity for music from a young age.
“I started playing classical violin when I was five. I had a choice to either take ballet or play violin, but I’ve always hated tutus — since I was kind of a tomboy — so I went with the violin,” Starlight recalled.
She said her father brought rock ’n’ roll into her life with his collection of David Bowie records. Though her mother was a church choir singer with a markedly different musical palette, she also influenced Starlight’s dreams.
From her upstate beginnings to her downtown gigs playing with artists including Kate Nash, Starlight has revved her engines to leave a mark upon the rock scene today.
But the industry hasn’t always been so kind to Starlight.
“There have been a lot of periods where it’s been hard getting a band together; I’ve at least  played with a hundred different people,” she said. “There’s been a lot of doors slammed in my face and days where I’m thinking, ‘Oh God.’”
Starlight currently performs alongside her boyfriend Zachary James, who leads a band of his own called “Zachary James and the All Seeing Eyes.”
“He’s my best friend. We write together. We create together,” she said. “I play keyboard and sing back up in his band.”
She describes how as a pair, they enjoy an assortment of activities, like designing their own clothing for shows.
“We went downtown and found red fringe one day and thought, ‘Oh cool! We can make a shirt out of this,’” Starlight said. “Normal clothing out of the rack doesn’t do it for us. We keep getting more and more outrageous.”
Outrageous is exactly what some of Starlight’s creations look like. Her edgy hairstyles with bursts of pink and purple, sequined costumes and bright makeup all bring a touch of femininity to the rock ’n’ roll world.
Starlight said she will always stand by her unique style and character.
“Just be real and be yourself. If you tell the truth and you’re honest with yourself, you will always find an audience,” she said. “I don’t think you will ever find me on the cover of a magazine in a pushup bra and lingerie.”
She sounds a bit like Janis Joplin, and  she credits artists like Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger for inspiring her fashion sense. But no matter the associations, it’s clear Starlight is developing her own angle on the rock scene. From the inclusion of jazzy trumpet samples in her songs to bedazzled vinyl records for her loyal fans, this budding artist knows how to put a twist on tradition.

Though film genres are in a constantly shifting state, perhaps none has declined so pervasively since the 1950s as the Western. A firm presence in Hollywood’s Golden Age, now years can go by before another filmmaker dares tread that deserted path with any gumption.

Thankfully, independent cinema has a way of instilling innovation and creativity into stories when they are most needed, and this happens to be case with David Lowery’s neo-Western Ain’t Them Bodies Saints. The film premiered to great acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival in January and has been gathering steam in the festival circuit ever since, with its American release date set for August 16.
Ain’t Them Bodies Saints tells the story of ill-fated lovers Ruth (Rooney Mara) and Bob (Casey Affleck), a pair of outlaws who are separated when Bob is sent to prison after claiming responsibility for shooting a police officer that Ruth had harmed. Years later, Bob manages to escape and sets out across the wide-open plains of Texas to find Ruth and meet his young daughter for the first time.
Trying to remain covert but determined to see his family, Bob contacts old friends and attempts to communicate with his wife. Ruth finds herself under the watchful eye of a local police officer with whom she has struck a wary friendship. Torn between her desire to reunite with her lover and the danger inherent in seeking him out, she fears for her daughter’s safety. As the law closes in on Bob, the star-crossed couple desperately attempts to negotiate a face-to-face meeting.
It is hard to know where to begin in describing Ain’t Them Bodies Saints’ many wondrous feats. The premise and story themselves aren’t particularly original, but what astounds is the way they are so delicately developed, so lovingly reproduced onscreen so as to envelop the viewer completely.
The film’s small-town Texas setting reproduces the 1970s but feels timeless, as if this cluster of abandoned farm houses and dusty bars had stood the test of time for centuries. Not much has changed here since the days of Butch Cassidy, and it shows. The measured pace and lingering shots recall Terrence Malick or even Robert Altman’s early work, but Lowery manages to make the film firmly his own. He is equally skilled in crafting profound, quiet exchanges of dialogue and suspenseful action sequences. Yet the melancholic sense of doom that hangs over the lovers’ story never ceases to be tempered with a timid sense of hope. This is the neo-Western as you’ve never seen it before, marked by vivid characters whose words echo long after the closing credits.
Bradford Young deservedly won the cinematography award at the  Sundance Film Festival for his stunning work on the film. He captures the quiet, dreamlike quality of the setting with graceful handheld camerawork and poetic compositions. The camera almost seems to happen upon the characters by chance, as if accidentally observing the intimate and spontaneous moments of their lives. Certain shots linger in the mind, such as Ruth walking and dancing with her daughter by the roadside, or the long dolly shot in which the lovers are torn away from each other by the police after being caught.
The incredible array of performances deserves equal mention, as they are all consistently excellent. Rooney Mara shines as the ex-outlaw struggling with her own desires and the need to put her daughter first. Quiet and contemplative, she nevertheless exudes confidence and power in her direct delivery of every line of dialogue. Mara and Casey Affleck share an ability to communicate years of longing and doubt without words, aided by the intense chemistry between the two actors.
Affleck likewise oscillates between a vulnerability and inner strength that is astonishing, mercifully far outstripping his brother’s talents. As if that weren’t enough, the supporting cast proves equally talented; Ben Foster delivers a subdued performance that bubbles with passion at the surface as the morally troubled policeman and Keith Carradine nails the role of Bob’s unforgiving, overprotective father.
Finally, the film’s music merits acknowledgement as well; composer Daniel Hart’s haunting soundtrack adds a lyricism to the images that grows progressively mesmerizing throughout the film. Reminiscent of Gustavo Santaolalla’s work on Babel, Into the Wild and The Motorcycle Diaries, the score makes use of melodic and protracted guitar arrangements. These songs alone could tell thousands of ill-fated love stories, but coupled with the film’s images their narrative power is breathtaking. Bodily percussion — clapping and snapping — constitutes the other half of the soundtrack, building suspense in a visceral way as Bob’s freedom becomes ever more precarious.
Ain’t Them Bodies Saints turns the western on its head, relying on raw storytelling power to convey a character-focused narrative that’s a far cry from the overly chaotic brawls that have defined the genre in the past. David Lowery faces the challenges of reinventing such an established field head-on, proving once again that when it comes to fresh perspectives, independent cinema is a lifesaver for audiences and filmmakers alike.

“Yeezy season approaching / F-ck whatever y’all been hearing.” So begins Kanye West on “On Sight,” the opening track of Yeezus, his solo follow-up to 2010’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
To be fair, “Yeezy season” came early this year: Yeezus leaked on June 14 (four days prior to its targeted release date), and one day later West and girlfriend/reality TV star Kim Kardashian became parents to a baby daughter born about a month earlier than expected. Reports and speculation regarding the couple’s daughter are already well underway.
It’s West’s brainchild Yeezus, however, that will be the locus of musical discussion this summer — a win-win for West, whose only defense against accusations of megalomania is a combination of artistic genius and cultural relevance that seems to nip at the heels of his superhuman narcissism.
That same combination thrusts West into uncharted territory on Yeezus. West combines disparate elements of house, trap, dancehall, industrial and jazz into a rhythmic master class that seems far more lean and focused in its execution than the sweeping, cathartic grandiosity of Dark Fantasy.
West also sounds far more engaged lyrically than on Dark Fantasy, although much of West’s emotional detachments on that album were by design. Despite what his newly adapted icy public persona might suggest, the lyrical content on Yeezus is intensely personal.
The album’s production was also significantly pared down by super producer Rick Rubin — a move that undoubtedly lends Yeezus an intense, minimalist aesthetic. Unlike Dark Fantasy, where the devil was in the details and West’s excessive use of them, Yeezus is as ghoulishly lithe as a coked-out runway model.
Armed with only Daft Punk’s plucking synthesizers and an impassioned growl on “New Slaves,” West reconciles “rich n-gga racism” and the unfortunate label of aspirational consumerism appended to black culture in America by breaking down traditional social power structures, rapping “You see it’s leaders … and it’s followers / But I’d rather be a d-ck than a swallower,” along with a host of other unprintable rejections of the American social hierarchy, including the Hamptons.
The album’s undeniable highlight, however, is the six-minute-long “Blood on the Leaves.” West returns to his Auto-tune delivery from 2008’s 808s and Heartbreak in an emotionally exhaustive effort set against vocal samples and piano chords taken from Nina Simone’s cover of “Strange Fruit.” As the track’s tension crescendos to climax, the imperious horn blasts of TNGHT’s “R U Ready” grip the track by the throat. West drops the Auto-tune on the third verse and snarls his way through a furious (and misogynistic) indictment of the hollow façades of the “second string b-tches, tryna get a baby.”
Though West squanders an opportunity to make a socially meaningful statement in the conventional sense (the power invoked by sampling “Strange Fruit” has far more potential for social depth), the management of seemingly irreconcilable ideas and sounds, the use of Auto-tune to signify varying degrees of emotional fracturing and his trademark politically incorrect candor all come together to create a track that is quintessentially Kanye.
Despite the social grandstanding and emotional depth of tracks like “New Slaves” and “Blood on the Leaves,” Yeezus is not above the club banger. The Daft Punk-assisted “Send it Up,” however, is an archetype of the form: alarm-like synths whine over menacing, minimalist bass lines giving the track a hypnotic, head-nodding quality. The infectious beat thankfully drowns out the mediocre rapping on the track, which includes West and guest King L rehashing uninspired tropes about sex, the club and West getting piggyback rides from his bodyguard.
As a rapper, Yeezus sees West at his most confident, as he seems to have grasped full control of his flow — on the opening verse of “On Sight,” West deftly navigates Daft Punk’s breakneck acid-synth syncopations with a playful sprezzatura: “Soon as I pull up and park the Benz / We get this b-tch shaking like Parkinson’s.” And while there are countless instances where the content of his lyrics leave something to be desired (“this the greatest sh-t in the club / since ‘In Da Club’”), they are, for the most part, tightly delivered.
For all the disparate elements Yeezus manages to combine musically, it becomes evident that West’s social statements fall flat against the more pressing issue of his personal struggles. It’s an honest statement of his failure to reconcile the two forces as much as it is a statement that the two forces, in his life at least, will always be in conflict. But being conflicted in pop music has never sounded this challenging while remaining so emotionally powerful and altogether listenable.
So, brace yourselves. Yeezy season is upon us.

This past spring, USC’s Neighborhood Academic Initiative celebrated the graduation of 57 students — its largest graduating class since 1997, according to NAI Executive Director Kim Thomas-Barrios.
Stars in the making · David Maquiling, adjunct faculty in the School of Cinematic Arts, teaches his NAI summer students the basics of film production including writing, shooting and editing. – Peter Nordahl-Hansen | Daily Trojan
NAI, an academic enrichment program geared toward students grades 6 through 12, provides a college preparatory setting for those who excel in the classroom.
“We’re always happy with milestones,” Thomas-Barrios said. “We now have over 700 graduates of our program, which is a big number for us.”
Currently working with Muir Middle School and the Foshay Learning Center, the NAI plans to expand to two more schools in the Boyle Heights area this coming September, in conjunction with USC’s Health Sciences Campus.
“We will double the numbers that the NAI program will work with,” Thomas-Barrios said.
With more than 700 students currently participating, the NAI will likely include 1,400 students within the next seven years.
Students typically begin the program in the sixth grade and attend classes on USC’s campus before and after their regular school hours. Students also attend the academy for four hours on Saturdays.
“They make sure that you’re in the college environment,” said Sarady Merghani, a rising junior at Foshay. “Even though I want to give up sometimes because it’s really hard, I think about how I can’t give up now.”
During the summer, students can retake math or English courses for credit or choose one of 13 elective-style classes, which include filmmaking, guitar, art and more — many taught by USC professors.
“We’ll have guitar and art,” Thomas-Barrios said. “The enrichment classes can widen their scope of understanding so that they’re learning as well as doing.”
Ninety-nine percent of students who have finished the program have gone on to college. If accepted to USC, NAI students receive a full scholarship.
Antonio Hernandez, a Foshay rising sophomore, said the program offers the means to pursue higher education.
“It gives us a lot of opportunity for those students who don’t have economic things to support them through their journeys to college,” Hernandez said.
Funding for the program comes from a multitude of resources, including foundations, individual donors and USC itself.
Students spend grades 6 through 12 with one another, developing close bonds.
“I think [NAI has] definitely changed us,” rising Foshay junior Maurissa Brown said. “I feel that if I wasn’t in the academy, I would have been swept up into that madness and peer pressure.”
Sylvia Lopez, a rising junior at Foshay, agrees.
“[NAI] doesn’t let you hang out with the wrong people,” Lopez said. “We see each other as brothers and sisters — we’re always there for each other. It’s like a second family.”

USC’s newest supercomputer has ranked as the fifth most powerful supercomputer in the U.S., reaching 531.6 teraflops, or floating-point calculations per second, according to USC News.
The computer was ranked by TOP500 Supercomputer Sites, where it was also listed as the 16th most powerful supercomputer used in academia, and the 53rd most powerful in the world.
The computer incorporates graphic processing units that allow it to process data much more quickly, USC News reported.
USC’s previous supercomputer was ranked the 10th-fastest academic supercomputer in the U.S. in November 2012. The new computer is both faster and smaller, taking about one sixth the space of the old one.
The computer is located in the USC Center for High-Performance Computing and Communications, a partnership across several disciplines that supports more than 110 research groups.

Former USC professor Walter Lee Williams was named the 500th person on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Most Wanted List on Monday.

According to the FBI, Williams is wanted for engaging in sexual acts with children, specifically boys between the ages of 14 and 17.
“Because of [Williams’] status, he has the means and access to children, and that’s what makes him dangerous,” Special Agent Jeff Yesensky said in a video posted to the FBI’s Most Wanted website.
Williams traveled extensively, and many of his victims are said to be citizens of third-world countries. USC previously listed Williams as an expert on Belize, Cambodia, China, Laos, Malaysia and Mexico. He held appointments in the anthropology, gender studies and history departments. USC verified that Williams left the university in 2011.
In addition, Williams started the Gay and Lesbian Review in 1996 and worked to build the ONE Institute’s archives. During his time at USC, Williams served as an adviser for several student organizations, including the Lambda Grads, Shades of Troy and the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Assembly.
USC released a statement on Monday: “USC is fully cooperating with the FBI investigation. The FBI has informed us that at this time there is no evidence that any of his alleged illegal activities were associated with the university or took place on campus.”
A $100,000 reward is being offered for information leading to Williams’ arrest. Those with information should call 1-800-CALL-FBI or visit the FBI’s website.
People should not forget all the good he did before all the bad
Now let’s hope the FBI captures other accused pedophiles like Sylvain Kustyan who is a fugitive from the law.  Kustyan, has been formally charged with two counts each of 1st Degree Sodomy and Sexual Abuse of a ten-year-old little boy, but fled the US to avoid imminent arrest.  Kustyan, formerly of Tuscaloosa, Alabama and Hermin/ Mazingarbe, France, is thought to be in Europe.  Kustyan, as a teacher led numerous groups of school children to the UK, Ireland and the US.  Since the average pedophile has 300 different victims in their lifetime and the recidivism rate among pedophiles is virtually 100%, they must be stopped ASAP!

As people spend more time with computers, their reliance on websites and Internet service providers grow. And yet, the government’s ability to monitor these technologies must keep up.
Edward Snowden leaked details to The Washington Post and The Guardian early June about a secret NSA program called “PRISM.” Government departments in the U.S. and the U.K. worked with nine of the largest Internet and tech companies to secretly obtain all kinds of data: messages, personal videos, emails, pictures, blog posts and Internet searches.
Moving forward, the greatest concern lies not in what information is entrusted to the government, but rather the ways in which it is used and how it is delegated.
If information is used for a specific purpose and is necessitated by a clear, compelling government interest, then the government has a legitimate reason to monitor that information. Most often, this is for counterterrorism but can also be used to counter identity theft, among other crimes.
Fishing expeditions are what separate the reasonability of government searches. Citizens ought not be comfortable with the government combing through billions of packets of data, as there have been much more direct methods which law enforcement have used, such as surveilling a suspect’s Internet activity.
Compared to the Supreme Court’s June 3 decision in Maryland v. King, which allows law enforcement officers to use DNA obtained from a suspect at the time of arrest, PRISM raises serious questions over the government’s role in handling our information. As with the PRISM program, citizens must be able to evaluate the purposes being served by these practices.
Despite the Supreme Court’s unwillingness to say so, the real purpose of taking an arrestee’s DNA is to potentially match it against cold cases which would otherwise have no leads and no chance of being solved. This is legitimate because the government collects a specific set of data — a suspect’s genetic code — whereas PRISM collects an unduly large set of data to search for legal transgressions.
What is most shocking about PRISM is the sheer volume of data it gathered. In a 30-day period in March, the NSA collected 97 billion pieces of information from computer networks across the world, 3 billion of which came from within the U.S., according to The Guardian. Despite testimony from NSA officials that a significant sample of attacks were prevented on both sides of the Atlantic, there must be ways to coordinate surveillance of these criminal groups without sifting through the data of millions of Americans.
Case in point: In 2012, Tarek Mahenna of Massachusetts was convicted of conspiring to help al-Qaida when he was found translating documents for the terrorist group. The government has the resources to monitor and scan websites, such as Mahenna’s, which actually work with enemies of democracy.
Instead of implementing broad, secretive programs like PRISM, the government must preserve some form of uniform accountability. It must publicize the guidelines that stipulate when information will be accessed, how long it’ll remain on government servers, why is it being accessed and whether collecting the data fulfills a narrowly tailored government interest. Otherwise, Americans could lose the very ideal of freedom upon which the U.S. was built.
 
Jack Merritt is a sophomore majoring in history.
Every website – even the DT has a “privacy policy” by LAW. Does the NSA need to follow the law? Is it lawful to issue secret letters from secret courts? Is it lawful to threaten people and or companies that receive secret letters with prosecution if they even mention that they have received a letter? Is not the right to protest against or speak against the government fundamental?

A Federal District Court judge in Manhattan ruled last Tuesday that Fox Searchlight Pictures had violated federal law by not paying production interns on the set of Black Swan. Judge William H. Pauley III said that the two interns in question practically worked as regular employees. Furthermore, the studio failed to facilitate an educational environment and reaped the benefits of the interns’ work, all of which violated the Department of Labor’s criteria for unpaid internships.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Cases such as this one illustrate the need for a solution to the rarely policed exploitation of unpaid interns. Increased regulation, however, is not enough. More attention should be given to a better whistle-blower program for victims.
The Fair Labor Standards Act is clear about what provisions an internship must satisfy in order for it to qualify as a proper unpaid internship. The position must be in an educational environment and of benefit to the intern. Unpaid interns must work in close supervision, not displace any regular employees and isn’t promised a job at the end of the internship. In addition, the intern’s work must not be of immediate advantage to the employer and it might even hinder the employer.
Unfortunately, the criteria are hard to enforce and it places the burden on interns to report illegal unpaid internships. This  grand notion fails because interns often fear that pursuing legal action against employers would hurt their chances of employment in the future. As such, the problem isn’t so much that there’s a lack of regulation, but that interns should have a better way to report illegal unpaid internships without fear of retribution.
The matter is complicated by the rising popularity of businesses offering college credit in lieu of payment. This kind of compensation limits the position and experience to those who are financially capable to dish out unit tuition. The undergraduate unit tuition rate at USC for this summer is $1,473, according to the USC Schedule of Classes. Low-income students can therefore lose out on much-needed experience, which further escalates the level of inequality in the workplace.
Employers often use credit as a reason to not compensate their interns; colleges in turn receive tuition money for summer courses.
The whole system, while intended to protect students from exploitation, is broken, and students are left to endure their financial losses and work basically for free — all in the name of “educational” purpose. Furthermore, federal regulations state that while college credit is a form of compensation, if the internship has little training and the work largely benefits the business, then the intern remains entitled to other forms of compensation.
Interns that do wish to brave the process and file a complaint face greater obstacles than regular employees. Kathyrn Edwards, a researcher at the Economic Policy Institute and co-author of a new study on internships, told The New York Times that because unpaid interns are not considered employees, they are not protected by employment discrimination laws.
Companies that decide to accept interns need to commit themselves to providing a productive work environment. Students should foster such change by actively disseminating feedback about their experiences, something that has gradually started through websites like internshipratings.com. And the issue is gaining more attention as the number of bad experiences at unpaid internships proliferates.
Nonprofit newsroom ProPublica caught sight of this issue surrounding the rising intern economy and launched a Kickstarter to fund an investigation. It hopes to raise $22,000 by next Wednesday to investigate the lack of protection interns — especially those who are unpaid — are receiving today. Based on largely anecdotal evidence alone, it appears ProPublica will have plenty to investigate.
“I don’t feel like I walked away with anything useful or something that I can apply to other jobs. It was mostly busy work,” said a’12 alumnus Jason Termechi to the Summer Trojan about his internship experience at an entertainment agency.
While students scramble to land a position to add to their resume, students must remain careful when applying for internships. They should keep in mind that the job descriptions can be a façade, and that employers can often give them too small or too big of a task. Taking up unpaid internships should be approached with extra caution.
It takes courage to stand up to one’s boss, but if unpaid interns feel that they’re expected to work as much as full-time employers do, they should feel that they have every right to express their concerns to their employer or the Department of Labor.
But the best way to facilitate a more open culture surrounding unpaid internships is to increase awareness of interns’ options when faced with improper unpaid internships. This country needs a streamlined program for whistle-blowers to efficiently submit complaints without the need to go to court or fear potential retribution, because not everybody can afford to sue their employers.

Last week, the NCAA announced the Academic Progress Rate multi year scores that cover the four-year period between the 2008-09 and 2011-12 academic years, and USC’s football team was subpar compared to the rest of the Pac-12 and the entire nation.
Student-athlete · The John McKay Center, USC’s $70 million, 110,000-square-foot athletic and academic facility that opened in the fall of 2012, houses the Stevens Academic Center, which includes spaces for tutoring, counseling and study and computer labs for student-athletes. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
The Trojans’ score of 945 is four points below the national average for football, and ninth-best in the conference for the second year in a row, after USC was given a multi year score of 947 last year.
The NCAA calculates APR scores by assessing the eligibility, retention and graduation rates of student athletes.
Currently, any score below 925 results in NCAA-mandated penalties, and if it is lower than 900, the team in question is barred from postseason play for the following year.
But in order to qualify for the 2014-2015 postseason, the bar will be raised to a multi-year score of 930, which approximates to about a 50 percent graduation success rate.
Northwestern scored the highest of any FBS team with 996, while New Mexico State (916) scored the lowest.
Stanford (978) received the highest score of any Pac-12 football team, and California (935) recorded the lowest. UCLA scored second-highest in the conference with 966.
USC’s men’s basketball team fared better than their counterparts on the gridiron, recording a 957, five points above the national average. But that score was still only good enough to tie Washington State for eighth place in the Pac-12, as Washington (985) led the conference.
The disclosure of APR scores captured the attention of the sports world last year when Connecticut’s basketball team  became the sport’s first team from a major conference to be banned from postseason play because of its APR score (889).
No basketball or football teams from major conferences are in danger of being barred from next year’s postseason.
Baseball fared the best of any USC team when compared to each sport’s national average, as its score of 990 bettered baseball’s national average by 35 points and was good for third-best in the Pac-12.
Of USC’s women’s teams, basketball received the highest score of 991, which was 19 points above the sport’s national average and second-best in the conference.

For 15 years, Caryl Smith Gilbert has been molding champion track and field athletes and leaders east of the Mississippi. Beginning next season, however, she will move westward to Los Angeles where she will take the helm of the USC track and field program from Ron Allice, who held the position of director for the past 19 years.
Up-and-comer · Caryl Smith Gilbert’s Central Florida track and field team recorded a program-best fifth place finish at this year’s NCAA indoor and outdoor championships, capping off an impressive six-year run. – Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
 
Smith Gilbert will have large shoes to fill, as Allice oversaw nearly two decades of success, including 25 combined men’s and women’s NCAA Top 10 finishes. His tenure also saw the women’s team win the 2001 outdoor NCAA title, its first in school history.
Though the Trojans are losing a leader responsible for nearly unparalleled success, USC athletic director Pat Haden is confident in his choice for Allice’s successor.
“[Smith Gilbert] has a superb history of success in her career,” Haden said in a press release. “She knows how to develop athletes, as evidenced by the steady improvement of her UCF program and the number of records her athletes set. She has recruited very well and knows the recruiting landscape in California. And her athletes have performed incredibly well academically.”
Haden’s words are bolstered by Smith Gilbert’s accolades. In her six-year tenure as head coach of the women’s track and field and cross country teams at the University of Central Florida, the Knights captured six Conference USA titles. Her teams featured four NCAA individual champions and more than 50 conference titlists. Furthermore, her Knights teams produced more than 100 All-Americans and broke more than 100 school records. Not surprisingly, Smith Gilbert was named the C-USA coach of the year in each of her six years with the program.
Smith Gilbert’s crowning achievement with the Knights was her program-best fifth place finishes at this year’s NCAA indoor and outdoor championships. After assistant coaching tenures at Tennessee, Alabama and Penn State, and her run of success at UCF, she will be moving one more step up the ladder as director of USC’s track and field program, arguably one of the most historically successful track programs in the country.
“This is a tremendous opportunity, a huge opportunity,” Smith Gilbert said in a press release. “While it is difficult to leave the program we built at UCF and I will forever be thankful for the support I received there, I am very excited about becoming a USC Trojan.”
While the USC men’s track and field program has been a perennial powerhouse with 26 NCAA outdoor titles, two NCAA indoor titles, 35 conference titles and 113 individual titles, the women’s program has not been quite as decorated.
With Smith Gilbert’s experience on the women’s side of things, the Women of Troy can expect a big lift in the years to come.
The hiring should have been for the women coach only since she has never dealt with the men side of
competition. Look at golf, a coach for women and a different one for the men, What is with choosing a
‘ruin for the position. It seems if she is so respected why didn’t ucla offer her a spot in their track program?

USC senior Bryshon Nellum, who closed out his USC career with an NCAA championship in the 400 meter last week in Oregon, was named the 2013 Pac-12 Male Track Athlete of the Year by commissioner Larry Scott on June 13.
Unrivaled · Senior Bryshon Nellum finished his USC career as the 2013 Pac-12 champion in both the 200 and 400 meter, becoming just the second athlete to accomplish the feat. He ran a personal record of 44.73 in the 400 meter final at the Pac-12 championships. – Kirby Lee | USC Sports information
 
In addition to this honor, the redshirt senior was also named the 2013 National Men’s Track Athlete of the Year by the U.S Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association.
At the NCAA Championships in Eugene, Ore. held from June 5-8, Nellum placed third in the 200m final with a wind-aided time of 20.27, and dazzled Hayward Field with a personal record of 44.73 in the 400m final, which was the fastest time run by a collegiate runner in 2013. Nellum’s time was the fourth-fastest ever by a Trojan in the finals.
“For my college career, it painted a perfect picture,” expressed Nellum. “Coming from all my injuries and having that long journey, this was a happy ending, winning the national title in the 400m and finishing top three in the 200m. Overall I’ve had a wonderful career at SC.”
Nellum also claimed Pac-12 championship titles in both the 200m and 400m, making him the second conference athlete to ever do so.
The last year for Nellum has been quite exceptional,as he made the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team last June, reached the Olympic semifinals in the 400 meter and was a silver medalist for the 4×400 meter relay team. He would then go on to graduate in December, begin to pursue his graduate degree and then finally excel at the highest levels of collegiate track and field in the spring.
As Nellum wraps up his USC career, he leaves quite a legacy of honors and records behind to be admired by future USC sprinters.
