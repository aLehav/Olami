Lisa Ling, an American journalist and host of CNN’s This is Life with Lisa Ling, spoke Tuesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom about her humanitarian efforts around the world.
The event, hosted by USC Speakers Committee and co-sponsored by the USC Service Student Assembly, USC Political Student Assembly, USC Special Events Committee, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and Women’s Student Assembly, also featured a question and answer session and a meet and greet.
Ling introduced herself as a fellow Trojan, who attended USC in the early ’90s but “didn’t quite make it to graduation.” Because she entered the professional sphere at a young age, reporting for Channel One News, Ling said she became enraptured by the stories she collected on her job assignments and elected to find her education by visiting different countries instead.
“Some of these stories made me a better person,” Ling said. “My hope is that you take these stories back to your dorm, and that they make you a better person.”
Reporting from distant places, Ling was faced with some harsh realities as a 21-year-old reporter, such as witnessing young, Afghan boys holding RPG guns larger than their frame. Ling said she was haunted by these images, but the questions that arose spurred her passion for field experience even more.
“I got to travel and immerse myself in different cultures and engage with different young people,” Ling said. “That’s why I didn’t graduate from USC — it’s because I was traveling. I think traveling is the best education. If there’s one takeaway here tonight, it’s to travel … I’m convinced that you are better, smarter, more marketable  as a job candidate if you travel.”
From there, Ling entered the daytime talk show arena, becoming a host on the ABC’s The View in the early 2000s. She quickly realized, however, that her position was just to draw out the younger demographic. While Ling wanted to share her knowledge about globalization and drug wars, her efforts were quickly curtailed at business meetings.
“The executives said, ‘Lisa, nice try, but no one in the United States cares about what’s happening in the world,” Ling said. “But I didn’t really believe that. I felt like there was this incredible world I needed to explore.”
Ling  left the show in 2002, and later joined the National Geographic channel, where she decided to spotlight places such as North Korea, a country in which her sister, Laura Ling, who is also a journalist, was imprisoned. Ling also set out to highlight the one-child policy in China, where the preference for male children has created an imbalance of males to females in the country.
In recent years, Ling has covered domestic issues, such as the mass incarceration problem in the United States. According to Ling, one in 12 black men will see prison walls at some point in their lives, often a result of minor charges such as drug possession, and are frequently forced into criminal activity because of financial hardship. After release, it can be hard for former convicts to find jobs due to company policy, she said.
“We say that we are a country that offers second chances to people, but I often wonder, ‘Are we really?’” Ling said.
Ling closed with a recitation from a poem, which implored audience members to affect change in their communities. She also cited a quote from Oprah, urging students to open their eyes to the injustices of the world.
“Oprah said, ‘Now that you know, you can’t pretend that you don’t,’” Ling said.

The 2016-2017 USG student body president and vice president were sworn in Tuesday night in the Ronald  Tutor Campus Center, following a ceremony where the 12 2016-2017 senators took the oath of office.
President Edwin Saucedo and Vice President Austin Dunn both took the oath of office, after which Saucedo delivered his inaugural address. Saucedo spoke of his surprise at obtaining the position of student body president, which he previously did not think was possible.
“As a freshman, I never pictured running for president to be a feasible goal or something that was meant for people like me,” Saucedo said.
Saucedo also mentioned his experience as a first-generation college student achieving success at USC, and briefly addressed his parents in Spanish.
“As the first of my family to go to college, I first needed to prove I could get the grades in classes before worrying about getting involved,” Saucedo said. “People in higher office at this University often come from affluent backgrounds, something I could not relate to.”
After his address, Saucedo expressed hopes to increase USG visibility and to involve more of the student body in the process.
“We’re excited for all the changes at USC that we’ll make a reality,” Saucedo said. “We want to make sure that senators are representing student voices, [and that] we are really opening up our student government. Students should know this year that the Senate represents them, and if they have any issues or concerns, that they should talk about that.”
Twelve senators were also inaugurated during the ceremony, who were elected in February out of a pool of 20 candidates. Despite a significant decrease in voter turnout, new senator, Leena Danpour, a junior studying political science, was hopeful about the diverse opinions of the new Senate.
“I’m very excited for the next year,” Danpour said. “I think we have a great group of people [with] very diverse opinions, [who are] very outspoken. I’m looking forward to what they have to say.”
Danpour also spoke on her hopes for the upcoming administrative year, especially concerning disagreements in opinion.
“For this next year, I hope that all senators voice their opinions, say what they want to say, and I hope that everyone out there has to hear what [we] have to say.” Danpour said. “The best solution comes with all opinions combined into a nice compromise. That’s what I’m looking forward to.”
Sen. Sabrina Enriquez, a sophomore majoring in mathematics, was sworn in for a second term as senator. Enriquez expressed enthusiasm toward the new Senate and hoped for less turbulence than in the previous Senate.
“I’m very excited to start my second term,” Enriquez said. “The first one was very rocky. I’m excited to get back at it and continue with my projects. We can only go up from where we started.”

The Center on Public Diplomacy at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted a panel Tuesday to discuss the possibilities for transformation in the relationship between the United States and Mexico based on the result of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The panelists included Arturo Sarukhan, the former Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. and a CPD distinguished fellow; León Krauze, a journalist, author and news anchor; and Pamela Starr, director of the U.S.-Mexico Network at USC and an associate professor of public diplomacy and international relations. The panel was moderated by Tom Hollihan, a professor of communication management at USC Annenberg, and centered on the bilateral ties between the two countries and the partisan rhetoric used by Democratic and Republican presidential candidates.
The panelists talked about how Mexico perceives the U.S. at this juncture, as well as the impacts of the campaign on the bilateral agenda. They also emphasized the public diplomacy footprint that will impact future relations between the U.S. and Mexico.
Starr listed the anomalies that have crept up in the political relationship between the two countries. She observed that while both the U.S. and Mexico have heavily relied on each other for decades, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has presented evidence that the countries don’t trust each other as much now as they did before. On the other hand, Sarukhan said that the impact of Trump’s rhetoric has been transnational, and the strategy of the U.S. should be to work alongside Mexico to promote Latino leadership in the country.
Krauze also reflected upon how to actively fight against nativism in the age of social media.
“I think there is a moral argument to be made,” Krauze said. “The Mexican government should push back and the other parties should push back, including the private companies.”
Krauze also pointed out that while twenty percent of Mexico’s current population is in the United States, the Mexican government was silent when Trump decided to target the country by calling for a wall to be built along the U.S.-Mexico border. He also questioned the stand of Claudia Ruiz Massieu, the Mexican secretary of foreign affairs, on this incident and pointed out how she went back on her statement to the Washington Post, in which she labeled Trump a racist.
The impact of Trump’s rhetoric, Sarukhan argued, may present itself in Latino voter turnout. Sarukhan pointed out that there is a difference of 5 million in the number of Latinos who register to vote and the number who actually turn out to vote.
“The difference is growing,” Sarukhan said. “We have not been able to mobilize them to vote. What I hope will happen as a result of this campaign is that there will be much higher incentives for the Latinos to come out and vote. We could see a slight increase in the number of Latino voter turnout.”
The student attendees found that it was important to have panelists with ties to Mexico because of their differing perspectives.
“It was good to have [opinions] from people who are from Mexico or are who are studying in Mexico,” said Michael Karakashian, a graduate student in public diplomacy. “There is a difference in perception, the people who were born and raised there and are following their academic pursuits here in the states, it was very valuable to know what they think about the current presidential candidates.”
“The conference went very well,” said Sergio de la Calle, a graduate student in public diplomacy from Mexico. “It is very important to bring people from Mexico who are experts on international relations, to talk about the complex historical relation between the USA and Mexico. I think the biggest problem between both countries is that they don’t understand each other; they don’t know about each other, and that’s a politician’s profit out of this misunderstanding.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misidentified the host of the panel. It is the Center on Public Diplomacy not the Center for Public Diplomacy. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Golden Globe-nominated actor David Oyelowo, Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education President Steve Zimmer and UCLA senior student activist Denea Joseph discussed their experiences in the education system and voiced their work toward educational justice in EdMonth’s closing panel, “Rebuild Our Education,” Tuesday night in Bovard Auditorium.
According to the organization’s flyer, EdMonth is a student-led campaign run by the Academic Culture Assembly devoted to raising awareness about the state of education in the United States. They programmed many events surrounding the education of marginalized groups in the past month.
The panel, moderated by EdMonth Executive Director Luis Vidalon-Suzuki, voiced their experiences with the education sector and recounted their activism work.
Oyelowo shared how playing historical roles, the most recent being Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, has inspired him to educate others about diversity in Hollywood.
“I never really thought of myself as an educator,” Oyelowo said. “When I was training to be an actor, I didn’t think it was going to expand people’s view of the world. But in playing roles in those films, specifically Dr. King, that has become a big component of who I am, what I do, what I aspire to do.”
According to Oyelowo, working with different perspectives and making more diverse movies will contribute to the goal of overcoming prejudice in Hollywood.
“You have to educate my industry, not only about the ignorances that have been allowed to exist for too long, but also build a bridge between what the audience wants and what they perceive the audience wants,” Oyelowo said. “The only way to do that is to literally make these movies.”
Joseph then spoke about her work as the co-founder of IGNITE (Invest in Graduation, Not Incarceration, Transform Education) at UCLA. Through the organization, she has led grassroots campaigns protest against tuition increases in the UC system.
As an undocumented student herself, the UCLA senior has personally felt the effects of the tuition hikes. She discussed her progress in getting a tuition freeze for the UC system, but she also shared her other projects that primarily put money from prisons into schools.
As a counselor and teacher for 17 years at Marshall High School prior to serving as LAUSD president, Zimmer recognized the disparities in the educational system from the beginning of his teaching career.
He, along with other teachers in the California education system, helped undocumented students and started a movement against Proposition 187, which aimed to prevent undocumented immigrants from using public services.
“It would have turned teachers into immigration agents,” Zimmer said.
Though all three panelists recognize the increased promotion of diversity in American education, they agree that there’s much work to be done and suggested what could be done next.
“We have a long, long, long way to go,” Zimmer said. “We need to work with every fiber of our being to rapidly change that.”

Football reached the halfway mark of spring practice on Tuesday, completing its seventh session at Howard Jones Field with cold wind gusts and a mix of storylines.
A Different Offense
Senior wide receiver De’Quan Hampton, who appeared in 12 games last season as a backup, expressed disappointment about former quarterback Cody Kessler’s unwillingness to target a variety of receivers last season.
Hampton added that he wasn’t the only receiver who felt that way, and that the two quarterbacks competing for the starting job this spring — redshirt junior Max Browne and redshirt freshman Sam Darnold — along with redshirt sophomore Jalen Greene spread the ball around more and have stronger arms.
“I know Cody was more accurate, but Max, Sam and [Greene], they just have some arms,” Hampton said. “I know that if I have a deep ball, I have to run, otherwise it’s going by me — especially with the wind blowing.”
Under new offensive coordinator Tee Martin, the Trojans appeared to be going deep more often.
“It’s the play calls,” Hampton said. “They’re emphasizing to the quarterbacks that ‘we need to take these shots.’ It’s there.”
One of the criticisms of Kessler while he was under center at USC was that he did not take shots downfield often enough and opted for check-downs instead.
“It just gives me more feeling like there’s a 50 percent chance the ball’s going to go your way,” Hampton said of the new offense. “It just lets me know we’re going to spread this around. We’re about to eat.”
Martin said that he has not game-planned for more deep passes; rather, the quarterbacks themselves are taking the initiative.
“A lot of guys play at receiver, so a lot of guys will get the ball,” Martin said. “It’s good how the quarterbacks trust a lot of guys. It’s not that one guy that they’re keying in on. They’re really spreading the ball around and going through their progressions.”
Martin revealed that the team learned 80 percent of the offense in three days, but much to his pleasure, there have been much fewer hiccups than expected.
“Credit [that] to veteran experience,” Martin said. “We have quarterbacks who’ve been here that understand the concepts and what we’re trying to get done with the way we operate in our offense.”
Quarterback Battle
While Browne has held the edge in the quarterback position thus far, head coach Clay Helton said Tuesday was Darnold’s best practice of the spring. Helton was confident that Darnold completed over 70 percent of his passes.
“I thought he was efficient, accurate,” Helton said. “I thought he played very fluid and timely. The ball came out quick. [In the past], he was holding onto the ball and making sure it was open. Now it’s just spitting out.”
Browne, who has two more years of experience than Darnold, felt confident in his performance.
“I feel comfortable,” Browne said. “I feel right where I want to be. I feel like I’m leading well, executing well, being efficient out there, which is all I can ask for.”
A new Justin Davis
Senior running back Justin Davis is looking to be more poised as one of the most experienced members of the backfield, aiming to focus on the bigger picture.
“I’ve got to learn how the offense works, how the defense blocks, how the receivers move,” Davis said. “I can’t just worry about myself now. I’m past that now. I have to worry about the game as a whole and not just my part.”
Davis said he can’t wait to run behind a stellar offensive line that is returning all its starters.
“It’s the perfect right moment now,” Davis said. “We can get the running game going and turn some heads this fall.”

Just one week after the reported departure of forwards Darion Clark and Malik Martin and a day after the two-year contract extension of head coach Andy Enfield, redshirt junior guard Katin Reinhardt became the next Trojan to depart USC, making an announcement on Twitter on Monday.
On Tuesday, head coach Andy Enfield officially granted releases to all three players.
Originally a transfer from UNLV, Reinhardt, a former four-star prospect, was ranked as the 47th best prospect in the nation in 2012, earning a 94 scout ranking thanks to his shooting capabilities.
During his freshman year with the Runnin’ Rebels, Reinhardt averaged a healthy 29.2 minutes, 10.1 points, 2.5 assists and 2.0 rebounds per game, while shooting 35.8 percent from the floor and 89.2 percent from the line. In an interview with CBS Sports’ Doug Gottlieb, Reinhardt said he left UNLV due to his reduced role on the offense and lack of ball handling.
“Everybody thinks I want to be a point guard — that isn’t true. [Former UNLV head coach Dave Rice] just said I would play mainly off the ball, and I am just not comfortable that way,” Reinhardt said three years ago. “I averaged three assists a game because I like to pass and can pass and I need to have the ball in order to create, not just stand in the corner or run off screens. I’m not that type of player.”
Unfortunately for the Men of Troy, Reinhardt’s primarily shooting role was not good enough, with the former Mater Dei guard transferring.
Considering that sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin and junior guard Julian Jacobs accounted for 65 percent of USC’s 504 assists, Reinhardt was understandably displeased with his 48 assists last season.
Not to mention, the 6-foot-6 guard averaged the least amount of minutes in his college career so far, dropping from 29.2 to 26.9 due to sophomore guard Elijah Stewart’s increased role in the offense.
Simply put, though, Stewart’s superior 3-point accuracy and per-minute rebounding totals earned him the starting job down the stretch after losing it to Reinhardt midseason. With 26.4 minutes per game, Stewart shot 42.9 percent from 3-point range and 45 percent overall in his final nine games as compared to Reinhardt’s 37.3 and 33.3 percent, respectively.
Reinhardt, a potent scorer with 11.4 points per game and a 44.4 percent shooting percentage in his final season with USC, is fitted to a role which Jacobs and McLaughlin already fill.
Expected to receive numerous offers with other Division I schools, Reinhardt has a lot to offer: a sweet shooting stroke, postseason experience and very much improved clamp-down defense which the Trojans will certainly miss in 2016.

It’s still hard to wash that taste out of my mouth. Almost two weeks later, the overwhelming feeling from the USC basketball season is what could have been and how the Trojans let one slip away against Providence in the first round of the NCAA tournament. It still hurts a little bit to see that replay of the final inbound play that sealed the Trojans’ fate or the stat line of USC’s free throw shooting down the stretch.
But of course, it’s time for me and other Trojan fans to look at the bigger picture. The 2016 men’s basketball season was a big success. It certainly ended much sooner, or at least much differently, than fans would have hoped. The potential that we saw during the first half of the season didn’t quite carry its way throughout the entire campaign. But nonetheless, it was the biggest step forward for a program in recent memory. It was just what the program needed in terms of showing that it was finally headed in the right direction for the long-term.
So while the timing of it does seem interesting, it makes sense for the University to have extended the contract of head coach Andy Enfield for an additional two seasons. It’s a largely symbolic move, given that he was already under contract until the 2019 season. But it’s a well-deserved vote of confidence for the man set on truly turning this program around, especially after there were some rumors developing that he could be moving elsewhere.
Enfield’s career record at USC now sits at 44-53, which isn’t that impressive. But this season’s 21-12 performance has the looks of a legitimate conference competitor and NCAA tournament threat. The most significant improvement, though, came in conference play, where the Trojans finally escaped from the bottom of the Pac-12 standings. With only two wins his first season, then three wins his second season, the Trojans finished dead last in the 12-team conference each year. But with an even 9-9 record in the Pac-12 this year, the Trojans finished tied for sixth place in the conference. A win over UCLA in the first round of the conference tournament was the cherry on top to a clean three-game sweep of the season rivalry, and though the Trojans didn’t make it past the second round after a loss to Utah, they came into Selection Sunday knowing that they belonged in the Big Dance.
It was the first time in five seasons that the Trojans made it into the NCAA tournament, a major milestone for Enfield to finally achieve. There was plenty of speculation that Enfield would be on the hot seat if things didn’t start looking up during his third year at the helm. But sure enough, he and the program finally began seeing the fruits of the rebuilding effort.
Coming into the tournament as a No. 8 seed, the Trojans knew they would face a very competitive matchup in the first round against Providence, all for the chance to take on the No. 1 seed on that side of the bracket. It hasn’t been since 2007 that the Trojans have made the Sweet Sixteen, and it wasn’t the most favorable draw for the Trojans’ chances of getting there this year. Sure enough, the Trojans fell in a highly contested 1-point game against Providence. Though the Trojans certainly could have closed it out against the Friars, and anything could have happened during a second round tilt with North Carolina, falling just short in the first round still leaves plenty to be proud of for the team.
The contract extension for Enfield comes just after rumors began circulating that he was on the short list to replace Jamie Dixon as the Pittsburgh head coach. In 13 seasons, Dixon led Pitt to Sweet Sixteen three times, and once to the Elite Eight, but left the school for his alma mater — TCU. As a former Big East and current ACC school, a move to Pitt could have been a promotion to some degree for Enfield. But ultimately, Enfield stuck with USC, and Kevin Stallings from Vanderbilt got the hire. It would be hard to imagine an on-the-rise football coach at USC ever leaving the school for something bigger — unless, of course, it was for an NFL gig. Hopefully, the Trojan basketball program will keep growing to a point where it is one of the most high-profile teams to coach.
The Pac-12 conference didn’t have a great performance in the tournament, with only two of seven teams making it out of the first round. No. 1-seeded Oregon made it all the way to the Elite Eight, but couldn’t get past No. 2 Oklahoma and make it into the Final Four. Nonetheless, the conference is sure to be competitive again next year. With Oregon showing its athletic prowess could now extend beyond just the football field, usual conference forces like Arizona and UCLA sure to rebound after disappointing 2016 campaigns, there still should be a lot of parity at the top of the Pac-12 conference standings.
But USC should take another big step forward in 2017 with all the current starters returning. It’s still too early to guess where exactly USC basketball will be in 2021, and the athletic department could look back on this extension as coming too soon if the Trojans plateau as just an average Pac-12 team. But the extension helps ensure that the right man for the job will be here to build on the current foundation and keep the momentum going.

Head baseball coach Dan Hubbs will have to wait a little longer for his 100th collegiate win as the Trojans stumbled to an 8-0 defeat to Loyola Marymount on Tuesday.
At 11-12, the team falls below .500 after a sloppy five-hit performance in a single-game matchup against LMU.
USC batters watched helplessly from the dugout as their teammates failed to score against LMU junior pitcher Blake Redman, who pitched eight strong innings and recorded seven strikeouts.
“You have got to give credit to [Redman],” Hubbs said. “He came off of seven scoreless innings against Irvine last week and then pitched eight scoreless today, that is a pretty good two weeks. I think he is tough to see.”
Oppositely, USC starting pitcher freshman CJ Stubbs could not manage to stop the bleeding after first allowing a triple to LMU designated hitter Sean Watkins in the second inning, which gave the Lions the first lead of the contest. Watkins scored on a ground out and an error to extend the lead to 2-0, and USC gave the third run of the inning away when junior catcher Jeremy Martinez overthrew his toss in an attempt to pick off an LMU base stealer.
LMU hitters kept the pressure on Stubbs during their next opportunity, opening the third inning with a lead-off single and adding 2 more runs with a home run from junior Cassidy Brown the following at-bat to extend the lead to 5-0 and end Stubbs’ night on the mound.
The Trojans had an opportunity to jump ahead in the first inning, putting two runners in scoring position with two out, but Martinez was picked off to end the inning. Hubbs noted how LMU seized the subsequent momentum.
“It hurt us right after because CJ did not have it in the second inning,” Hubbs said. “He mislocated his pitches a couple times with two strikes and allowed a big inning. And then the next inning, he gave up two more.”
Sophomore pitcher Mason Perryman posted a strong no-run, three-inning performance, only allowing two hits. But senior Marc Huberman struggled as soon as he was put into the game in the seventh inning when he walked his first batter and eventually give up 3 runs after Brown singled to right field to score 2 runs give the Lions an 8-run lead.
Hubbs will not get his milestone, and the Trojans fall below .500. They will head to Stanford for a three-game series starting Friday.
“The thing that is disappointing is that when you are battling to win those games and trying to separate your record, it just magnifies when you have those days when you can’t do anything against the pitcher,” Hubbs said. “But I’m sure we are going to get better this weekend.”
 
Why on earth did the batter leave our guy on third base out to be picked off and why are we even considering a play lie that on two outs…. the coaches were not denied they got what they earned.
First the Trojans were 10 – 11 after the second loss to UCSB on Friday last. There is something mental with this team. Pitching has been mediocre with big names of last season having bad outings too many times. Hubbs expertise was as a pitching coach, and he seems to have no idea how to get a few of the pitchers back on track. Way too much base running blunders this far into the season.

Three Trojans were named Pac-12 Track and Field Athletes of the Week on Tuesday, marking the second week in a row where USC athletes have dominated the Athlete of the Week competition.
Sophomore Ricky Morgan was selected as the men’s track athlete, senior Jaide Stepter was selected as the women’s track athlete and sophomore long jumper Adoree’ Jackson was selected as the men’s field athlete.
Morgan’s award came after winning the 400-meter dash at the Power Conference Cardinal and Gold meet, running a personal record of 45.54 seconds and taking almost a second off his previous personal record. His time is the best in the country and helped the Trojans take second at that meet against high-ranked teams such as No. 3 Florida, No. 7 Texas and No. 13 Ohio State.
Septer also runs the 400-meter dash and set the USC women’s record at the Cardinal and Gold meet at 50.91 seconds. The time ranks fifth in Pac-12 history and leads the country. Septer also ran a 50.6 second leg to win the women’s 4×400-meter relay at the same meet.
Jackson won the long jump at the Cardinal and Gold Challenge with a 7.82-meter jump, a length which tied for sixth in the country. He also placed second in the 100-meter race with 10.41 second time, which ranks in the top 20 in the nation.
This was the second Athlete of the Week award for all three of these Trojans in the last two weeks of the 2016 track and field season. Their next meet will take place this weekend in San Diego at the California Collegiate Invitational.

Gallery Nucleus in Alhambra opened its newest exhibit, Mad about Mid-Century: Tribute to Eames on March 19. The exhibit celebrates the work and legacy of 20th century husband-and-wife architect duo Charles and Ray Eames — pioneers in modern art, design and architecture. Though their contributions extend far beyond just furniture, their most renowned design — the Eames chair and its various variations — is the center of the exhibit. The “Eames Lounge Chair” was the very first piece of furniture designed by the couple in 1956. Made of molded plywood and leather, the chair is known for its versatility, comfort and revolutionary design.
The paintings and models in the gallery all pay tribute to the late designers and incorporate the Eames chair in unique and creative ways.
“Eames Therapy P1” by Roman Muradov, is a piece, made with ink and gouache, that incorporates the Eames chairs and portrays them as people in a therapy session, with punny dialogue like “Please take a seat. So what’s been bothering you lately? “Eames Therapy P2” plays on the same concept, but escalates it with the therapy session going out of hand. “You’re being very uncooperative,” says the chair to the other. “This is my practice not yours.”
The Eames House Bird and Eames Elephant also make appearances in Eren Blanquet Unten’s “Elephant” and “Work and All Play” by Loris Lora. The Eames House Bird, known for its elegant simplicity and glossy tail, has been an important symbol in the Eames Office and has appeared in numerous works by the couple.  The couple’s interest in elephants led them to design the enchanting Eames Elephant, which also appeared in Charles Eames’ photographs.
The most charming tribute was “La Chaise on Green,” by Lora. It features the Eames La Chaise, with a black cat sitting on top of it with an orange ball of yarn. The background is all green, with leaves of different shapes and shades. The Eames La Chaise is a lounge chair famous for its organic design and is made of bonded fiberglass shells, a chromed base and natural oak feet. It is made with gouache on paper and mounted on board.
In the section model, “351 Ocean Avenue” made on Baltic birch plywood, artist Judson Beaumont integrates the Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman as well as the Eames La Chaise in the other room, with a section cut splitting a fraction of the house out as a divider, separating the two rooms.
“The exhibit was well curated with tribute work and truly embodied the essence of Charles and Ray Eames,” said Brett Su, an environmental design student at the Art Center College of Design. “They revolutionized chair design using bent plywood because they molded it to an organic shape which hadn’t been done a lot back in the day. My favorite is the Eames Molded Plywood chair because of its charm and elegance.”
Some of the artists on display are Drake Brodahl, Edward Juan, Ellen Surrey, Unten and Jan Van Der Veken.
Surrey, a Los Angeles-based illustrator, also held a book signing for Mid-Century Modern Women in the Arts the same night at the gallery. The book, authored by Gloria Fowler and illustrated by Surrey, commemorates females in art, design and fashion. It showcases 25 portraits of heroines that have garnered considerable creative successes in the ’30s and the ’60s. Each page is filled with original, colorful illustrations and captures Surrey’s vibrant and modern artistic style. They also included inspirational quotes and rules for artists by artists, like Japanese-American artist Ruth Asawa, who said, “Sculpture is like farming. If you just keep at it, you can get quite a lot done.” In addition to the signing, Surrey also contributed Eames-inspired work and is featured in the Mad About Mid-Century exhibit.
The gallery gave away a free 1950s Eames Molded Fiberglass Chair courtesy of Design Within Reach to a lucky winner.
Gallery Nucleus’ mid-century exhibition does the iconic artists justice with its large variety of tribute pieces on various mediums. Their timeless style and legacy will influence many generations of artists and designers to come. Mad about Mid-Century: Tribute to Eames is available for viewing until April 3 with free admission.

If you’re a fan of alternative-indie pop, you should add newcomer Grace Mitchell to your “new discoveries” playlist. The Oregon-native and rising popstar might still be too young to buy a beer, but her songwriting skills showcase confidence and wisdom beyond her years. From her refreshing cover of Hall & Oates’ 80s classic “Maneater,” on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty soundtrack to the club banger “Jitter,” it is evident that Mitchell will continue to gather momentum. At only 18 years old, she’s on the fast-track toward the music career she wants.
“I wouldn’t have it any other way,” the singer-songwriter told the Daily Trojan during a call from Hollywood, California in early March. “I feel really privileged, while my classmates were doing academia stuff I was making music. I’m really thankful; my experience has been really great.”
Mitchell was in town for a couple days, opening for synth-driven pop band St. Lucia at the Fonda Theatre.
“I’m really excited, I feel really honored,” Mitchell said. “They’re a great crew; their music is infectious, exciting and fun.”
Mitchell moved to Portland to pursue a music career after growing up in the small town of Cottage Grove, Oregon. After being signed to Republic Records in 2013, she constantly drove 10 hours back and forth from Portland to Los Angeles.
“Big city, big mentality,” Mitchell said. “Los Angeles is a lot more urban, more cosmopolitan [and] people have the same ambitions.”
For a while, it was nice to be in Oregon, but she doesn’t believe it’s necessary to make it a part of her image anymore.
One week prior to moving to Los Angeles, New Zealand award-winning radio DJ Zane Lowe, called Mitchell’s single “Jitter,” a “world record” when the song premiered during his Beats 1 radio show.
“This might be the song of the year so far, honestly,” Lowe said on the broadcast.
“Jitter” is the lead single of  Mitchell’s EP, the five-song Raceday that followed Design, her first EP. Design was her first attempt in establishing her place in the prestigious pop world. Her raspy vocals have drawn comparisons to the likes of Lorde. But Raceday has Mitchell experimenting with various strands of hip-hop and pop. For instance, “Breaking Hearts,” is an electronic-pop track influenced by the sounds of Charlie XCX and Chvrches. “Jitter” on the other hand, is a hip-hop-heavy title track. Combining stuttering electro-pop and hip-hop, Raceday is quirky yet genius. Mitchell is on her way to enter the world of pop radio. So far, the single “Jitter” has made an impression within the pop blogosphere over the past months.
Mitchell is currently working on a full-length debut album with a targeted summer release. Mark Foster, the leader of indie-pop band Foster the People, co-produced Raceday along with record producer Rich Costey of the Foo Fighters, Interpol, Muse and Sigur Ros. The singer has continued collaborating with Foster the People and Costey on some new tunes that could possibly appear on her in-the-works debut album. Since a young age she’s followed the career of singer-songwriter and pianist Tori Amos with great reverence. She claims working with Amos “would be a crazy collaboration.”
In the meantime, Mitchell has opened for The Weeknd at the Apple Music Festival and performed at the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas. Yet her most memorable performance is an intimate show at the A&R Music Bar in Columbus, Ohio.
“It was a fun [experience]. That night, me and all of the headliners all hung out after the show,” Mitchell said. “It’s weird when you go to a city and you don’t know your way around — it’s always an adventure to have fun, you know?”
It seems that Mitchell has smartly decided to avoid committing to any direction too specific. Her sound and execution are assuredly her own and both are extremely exciting.
Mitchell is scheduled to perform at the Sleep Train Amphitheatre at Chula Vista on June 5 and 6.

It’s come to my attention that you need a Tinder tutorial. Don’t pretend you don’t use it, but don’t feel bad either. Tinder is surprisingly ubiquitous given its bad rap. People say they don’t use it because they don’t want to seem promiscuous or superficial, but it’s really no different from what we do in a bar. You scan the room and decide if you want to flirt with anyone. Or if you’re less outgoing, perhaps you set your sights on making someone flirt with you. Or you just stare. But you select potential mates all the same, with your eyes rather than your index finger.
To state my credentials, I’ve used Tinder for a year and met four people — three in the context of dates (the fourth helped me join a swim team) and two that I continued seeing for several months. I have never been harassed or received unwanted attention.
I should qualify that by Tinder, I mean Tinder, OkCupid, Bumble, Grindr, Hinge, etc., but I have the most experience with Tinder and would venture to say it’s the most popular of these options. As I’ve only seriously used it seeking men, I can’t comment specifically on men seeking men, women seeking women or men seeking women. Furthermore, I recognize that each dating app has its own culture, so what I have to say may be completely inapplicable. However, learning to discern who’s interesting and who’s creepy via minimal profiles is useful not only for dating, but also in our increasingly digital experience as well.
The first thing to keep in mind is that the profile pictures are not a representation of who these people are — they’re what that person thinks is attractive. An image of someone physically fit posing in a swimsuit says not that they are hot necessarily but that they rely on their hotness. That one may be obvious, but let’s take another common image — selfie with cat. Selfie with cat says not that they have a cat or that they like cats, but that they align themselves with cats as a culture — cat videos, cuteness, hipness, the internet, the perceived values of the other hoards of people who pose in pictures with cats. They’re showing you they identify as cat people, and they think it’s attractive that they do.
To discuss the implications of typical Tinder images would take volumes. Unfortunately, I only have 800 words, so I’ll give you a sample of how I swipe right. Let’s take Arthur. I came upon a picture of him Downtown at a bar, which tells me he either lives Downtown or was also at a bar. He has long, disheveled but healthy-looking hair, and his first photo pictures him in old-school coke-bottle glasses. He looks for all intents and purposes, like a molester.
But wait! No one at this age lacks the self-awareness to know ladies don’t go for the guy in pedophile glasses. Tell me more. He’s giving an animated speech at a wedding. He’s stoically brushing his teeth. Clad in a black suit, he seriously holds a red cup next to a potted plant. No selfies. His Instagram is linked to his profile — he’s an illustrator and he wants us to know it — and his bio says he can fit his fist in his mouth.
On the surface, nothing special. Everyone in L.A. is an artist or a producer or a writer. Everyone has long hair, takes quirky pictures and makes Mean Girls references. What gets me are the glasses — they change the whole bent of what he seems to be looking for. He is a good-looking guy, witty, artistic — but instead of using crowd-pleasers like hiking and sushi to broaden his appeal, he’s narrowing it. That’s exactly what I did when the initial thrill of new matches wore off. Lo and behold, two meaningful matches and a swim team. I like Arthur, swipe right. A few days later, great conversation about Wayne White and Matt Groening.
Tinder is only as sinister as you make it. It can be predatory and shallow if you use it that way — if it becomes uncritical online shopping without consideration of what your matches want you to see or what your preferences say about you. If you receive disgusting come-ons, it may be useful to see if those matches all have a shirtless gym selfie or say anything about Netflix. If everyone you match with is needy, it may be useful to see if they said something about sushi or cats. So much of life is online now — feeling out the patterns of representation is essential not just for dating, but also for knowing how platforms shape your social experience, and how a platform shapes you.

Former USC President Steven Browning Sample died Tuesday at age 75, according to a statement issued by current President C. L. Max Nikias the same day.
Sample served as president of USC from 1991 until 2010 when Nikias succeeded him. Under his watch, according to Nikias, USC underwent a “dramatic, historic ascent,” increasing its outreach and prestige. Sample remained on the USC Board of Trustees after his tenure ended.
“So many of USC’s successes, so much of our university’s current stature can be traced back to Dr. Sample’s dynamic leadership, keen foresight, and extraordinary prudence,” Nikias told USC News. “Dr. Sample stood over our university — and led our Trojan Family — as it began its singular transformation, and for this we should all be grateful.”
During Sample’s presidency, the University began a fundraising campaign called Building on Excellence that raised over $2.85 billion, shattering goals and setting records for donations to universities. According to the Los Angeles Times, USC’s endowment under Sample peaked at $4 billion dollars prior to the Great Recession, nearly ten times its $450 million value upon his arrival to the office in 1991.
Sample also spearheaded the Good Neighbors Campaign and Neighborhood Academic Initiative, which marked larger investments in the University Park community than USC had attempted before. According to Nikias, under Sample USC transformed in ways that the community will feel “generations from now.”
Sample earned bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Devices created with his patents can be found in more than 300 million microwave ovens and other home appliances worldwide, according to USC News.
Sample went on to serve as a professor at Purdue University, the University of Illinois and the University of Nebraska before becoming president of the State University of New York at Buffalo.
In a statement, Steven Spielberg, famed director and USC trustee, remembered Sample’s contribution to USC, to its School of Cinematic Arts, and to Spielberg himself.
“Steve was an ‘all for one and one for all’ kind of university President,” Spielberg said. “His ‘can do’ spirit was accompanied by the word ‘now.’ That’s how he got things done.”
However, Spielberg also noted that, though he has now passed, Sample left an indelible mark on the University.
“While he left behind very big footprints, he gleefully encouraged others to fill them as President Nikias has done and will continue to do,” Spielberg said. “I’ll miss Steve, but just walking around campus, you can feel him everywhere.”
There will be an interfaith prayer service in memorial for Sample Wednesday at 12 p.m. in Hahn Plaza.

Earlier this month, efforts to curb the University of California out-of-state and international student enrollment rate were thwarted. Championed by Assemblyman Kevin McCarty, Assembly Bill 1711, would have capped non-California resident students at 15.5 percent of the entire university population for each of the ten campuses. Though the bill hit a wall in its ratification process, there are still intentions to see the plan to fruition, an action that would ignore many sound arguments. Ultimately, the admittance of non-California students not only ensures economic security, but also cultivates diversity.
At USC, even though many students may deem certain UC schools enemies during game days, it is hard to deny their prestige. According to a 2015 report, eight UC colleges placed on the Times Higher Education World University rankings, based on a criteria such as “teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook.” UC Berkeley and UCLA also led the list as the top public institutions in the world. With their emphasis on holistic academic development, it’s easy to see how close to 50,000 out-of-state and international applicants sought to make UC schools their choice for matriculation.
A statewide audit revealed Thursday found that admissions standards for in-state students were more stringent than for out-of-state students, strengthening the sentiment that increased admittance of out-of-state students actually hurts in-state students. On the surface, it seems as if many UC schools have elevated their standards for in-state admission while maintaining relaxed standards for nonresidents because they will pay more.
Regardless of this criticism, such a policy change is necessary because, behind the scenes, California’s financial support for the UC schools has been severely slashed. Coupled with the effects of the recession and rising costs of resources, states largely withdrew their support for public education, so much so that in 2012, tuition — not state government budgets — became the driving factor in keeping schools open during the 2011-2012 school year. In order to hold their schools to the same standard, the UC system turned to out-of-state students to subsidize the cost of academics. With the out-of-state price tag almost twice the amount of what in-state students pay, looking out of state was the only option to keep schools open.
As UC President Janet Napolitano revealed in a March 8 letter in response to an investigation on the effects of the current admission standards on California students, it would be “unfair and unwarranted” to assume that officials were trying to do anything else other than “[mitigating] the impact of a 33 [percent] budget cut.” In fact, without the support of funds from out-of-state students, residents would have faced a $2500 increase in tuition. Ultimately, this was a choice made in part to preserve the academic quality amid a shortage of resources.
Here at USC, a private institution that takes pride in the fact that students matriculate from all 50 states and 75 different countries, it’s easy to sever our student body from the UC system’s. But with tuition hikes and ongoing discussions about campus climate, our stories are not so different. Everyone deserves an equal chance to gain admission and thrive among others.

You can’t have your cake and eat it too — a line we’ve all heard way too often. However, it’s trite but true, and aptly applies to the attitude many students have in light of recent events.
There have been several causes that have galvanized the student body. Recently, the University enacted a tuition hike from $49,464 to $51,442, coming after Undergraduate Student Government and others have been pushing for a tuition freeze. On March 7, students took to the streets to protest the decision.
Students and student government have also pushed for additional steps to improve campus. Last fall, USG passed a Campus Climate Resolution, which sought to address discrimination and diversity on campus. Among other things, the resolution called for a $100 million dollar fund to support underrepresented minorities, a vice president of diversity, and additional cultural resources. Students have even stood with campus workers in protest and to support increased wages and benefits for campus workers.
One, if not all, of these issues have been supported by the majority of the student body; however, students have neglected the practicality and consequences of the issues.
There’s no such thing as a free lunch. If campus workers are to receive higher wages and better benefits, then the University has to find the money to make it happen. If there is to be a $100 million fund to support underrepresented minorities and additional administrative positions, then the University must find a way to generate the necessary capital. From the University’s perspective, both of these are easily solved and accommodated by raising the tuition. But how could the University realistically acquiesce to these demands while also committing itself to maintaining or lowering the current cost to attend?
It is easy to get behind every cause worth supporting, however, each student must consider how each fits into the whole. Students cannot be naive and must practically consider the full implications of the causes they support if they are implemented. Many students claimed that the tuition hike is an indication their voice has been ignored, when in fact it is the opposite. A tuition hike is one very realistic possible consequence of the University hearing the student body’s voice, of the University meeting the demands and reforms advocated for.
The price of tuition, workers’ rights and diversity are all critical issues we must continue to discuss. But beyond the politics of each of these issues is an undeniable fact that we all must consider, which is that in many ways, one or more of them are mutually exclusive. Any failure not to observe this would be shortsighted. What really must take place is a conversation about what is most important to us as student body. If we have to choose, what is most critical? We can’t have our cake and eat it too.
Colin Parker
Assistant Director, USG University Affairs
Actually, this piece is a fair and accurate portrayal of reality.  Young people today have become a “cake and eat it too” generation.  (Not in the country legally? No problem, here’s a drivers license…. Oh, and here’s a license to practice law too!  Anyone remember that one from the CA supreme court?)  Many goals are virtuous, but still cost… and the cost is not always monetary.  It’s often about sacrifice in many forms!  
And what’s this nonsense about USC not paying it’s employees a living wage?  USC’s wages are very competitive from the top down, and include a tremendous benefits package including tuition remission for children.  The under-educated or unskilled person sweeping the floors or taking your order at Lemonade clearly should not be making the same wage as the person managing one of the departments, or a professor teaching classes.  So if we arbitrarily decide that the unskilled worker deserves a raise (and maybe they do), shouldn’t we raise everybody else’s wages above them, so that a “fair” and appropriate parity remains?  Nobody thinks about the long term implications.  There is a cost.
By the way, the “campus climate resolution” is just that… a resolution.  It’s not a law and it’s not something the board has voted to adopt.  Young people think they can just bully their goals into being.  Much of it is silly anyway.  Diversity is currently one of the most overused and abused words.  There is tremendous diversity at USC in the first place, and in Los Angeles, and in our nation.  Enough with the victim-hood and coddling.  Stop asking why there aren’t more black people here… or Hispanics doing this… or Asians over there!   I’ve said it before and I will say it again:  Stop chasing equality!  Equality rarely occurs in life or in nature.  Instead, chase FAIRNESS.  That is actually a virtuous goal.  What is fair is not always “equal”.  
We need to It’s not about who the blackest person or whitest person is… it’s about who the right person is, whatever colour that may be.  That’s true diversity.  That’s truly fair.   And above all else… while at USC you should be focused on learning and classwork, and preparing yourself for a meaningful, satisfying and hopefully prosperous life ahead.  Way too many distractions that people get caught up in these days.
This piece presents a false dichotomy. Other schools pay their workers a living wage and still have lower tuition than USC. Most of our tuition doesn’t go to workers or student services, it goes to administrative salaries and lawsuits, that’s why USC isn’t transparent about it. Also the campus climate resolution specifically stipulated that it would not raise tuition.
