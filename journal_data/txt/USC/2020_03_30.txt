There is no perfect formula for creating a pop star, but if there was, Dua Lipa seems to have found it. 
The 24-year-old London artist had proven herself as one to watch with singles “New Rules” and “IDGAF” from her 2017 self-titled debut album turning into catchy radio hits. But at the time, she still lacked a complete artistic presence, which was reflected in her underwhelming performance at the BRIT Awards in 2018. 
Fast forward to today, Lipa is ready to take the pop world by storm with choreographed numbers and neon visuals. Her previous blockbuster singles were simply the rocket fuel for her latest project to take off. 
In the midst of a global pandemic and online leaks, “Future Nostalgia” debuted March 27, a week earlier than anticipated. These circumstances had little effect on the impact of the heavy-hitting album where we hear Lipa in full command. 
Drawing on the fondness of the past, the 11-track project captures the essence of disco culture while delivering snappy basslines and Daft Punk-esque effects for listeners to explore. 
The album introduces itself with the title track and a clear statement: “You want a timeless song, I wanna change the game.” 
Much of the appeal of “Future Nostalgia” comes from how refreshing it sounds. This past year saw the rise of monumental pop artists, such as Lizzo and Billie Eilish, who flaunt vulnerability and intimate lyrics — a stark contrast to Lipa, who thrives by exuding an effortless cool. The idea of this untouchable pop star creates desire, one that makes audiences thirsty to follow.
Even when using samples, the artistry of the album goes beyond simple imitation. The funky guitar strums of INXS’s “Need You Tonight” are transformed in Lipa’s “Break My Heart.” The mix of references and innovative production serves as an ode to the glitter disco era. 
On “Love Again” the instrumental intro is built off of White Town’s iconic 1997 “Your Woman.” With these musical snippets, she creates layers keen listeners can begin to dissect.
The combination of the artist’s work and influence goes beyond samples. Her collaborations bolster its commercial appeal, and the innovative nature of subtly featured artists amplifies Lipa’s already-explosive tracks. Notable hip-hop producer Take a Daytrip’s placement of bubbly effects can be heard in the quirky track “Good In Bed.” And in the sultry track “Cool,” Tove Lo’s songwriting skills shine through on the captivating hook. 
The breakout track on the project is “Levitating,” which has fun melodies and 808 drum rhythms that make it the perfect dance floor song. The call-and-response and dance break components seem as though they were placed with audience participation in mind. Overall, it’s a dynamic track that encapsulates the careless excitement that comes with a fleeting love-interest. 
The structured bass lines and synths throughout the album provided a sense of cohesiveness; while each song is distinct in style, the same underlying instrumentals give the project an elevated production feel.
Every aspect of the production was deliberate and a result of constantly learning on the job. In an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats, Lipa details using “the same strings in multiple different songs” and “singing everything on the same mic,” elements of music production that she has learned over the course of her career. 
The album ends on a different note than expected, but not shocking given Lipa’s history of championing women. 
“I talk so much about female empowerment, but I’d never done a song which really talks about the growing pains of what it’s like to be a woman,” she explained via Apple Music. “[‘Boys Will Be Boys’] is a completely different element, but lyrically it was very important for me to have it on the record.” 
But while the stylistic choices made on the closing song lend it to be a powerful cinematic finale, it ultimately ended up falling short. The combination of basic lyrics and a muted children’s choir fail to make the hard-hitting impression Lipa hoped for.
When speaking to the vision of the album, Lipa shares her own feelings of musical nostalgia to Apple Music. 
“I remember listening to songs by Moloko and Jamiroquai, which would make you want to dance no matter what time of day it was,” she said. “I wanted to recreate that feeling.” 
In a time of uncertainty, the album invites listeners to give into the freedom that music provides. It builds a vibrant world that can be accessed only on the shimmery dance floor. The standalone strength of each song on “Future Nostalgia” establishes it as the standard for commercial pop artistry. This year has been full of surprises, but Dua Lipa’s pop stardom has been the most exciting to witness.

To my fellow Trojans near and far, I write this column with the understanding that the coronavirus pandemic has radically transformed our lives. Most of us are no longer within the 2-mile radius of Fryft. For myself, in seeking out some sort of normalcy in the havoc of canceled plans, unfinished resolutions and abrupt endings, I am reminded of why I started drinking wine in the first place.
Wine is a tool through which I built my social community here at USC — toasting a glass of champagne when one of my friends secured their summer internship, crying over a first heartbreak with my girlfriends over a glass of red wine and attending Friday happy hours at Rock and Reilly’s while always ordering their House Cab. 
When the public health response to the virus escalated and the USC community went into social distancing mode, I felt a tremendous amount of sadness but couldn’t understand why I was feeling this way. It wasn’t until a few days later that I was grieving the loss of social community that many of us took for granted. 
With these ever-evolving circumstances, it’s crucial for our emotional and mental well-being to maintain some sanity. And to assist, here are a few ways to improvise your wine game.
Wine nights on Zoom
Zoom, with its virtual backgrounds and filter add-ons, is the perfect tool to hold a virtual wine night. So far my friends and I have joined together for an in-house bar crawl (where we have different drinks as we move around the house), Zoom-ed into happy hour and drunkenly discussed a memoir of a USC alumna-turned-CIA agent. 
The possibilities are endless when we use our imagination! Or don’t use your imagination and just gather with your friends over Zoom for no reason other than to just chat over wine. What is most important is that we maintain our social connections throughout this time apart. 
Sign up for wine clubs
Seen the lines lately at Trader Joe’s? Trying to practice social distancing? Do you drink at least one bottle of wine per week? Is being at home or with your family becoming unbearable? (Just joking!)
If you answer yes to these questions, perhaps now is the time to complete an important milestone of adulthood — joining a wine club. A wine club typically consists of a monthly subscription where a winery or an associated business ships a selection of wine to your front door. Some affordable options are Vinebox ($72 a year for nine glasses of wine shipped quarterly), Winc Wine Club (many options under $15 per bottle and free delivery for four bottles or more) and Wine Awesomeness ($49 per box of three bottles averaging around $16 per bottle). 
Become a wine connoisseur
With all this free time outside of classes, books have become a normal staple in my social distancing life. Why not use this time to become a booksmart wine connoisseur? Wine Folly’s “Magnum Edition: The Master Guide” is a good start. It was the first book I read about wine, and it has helped me tremendously in understanding a wine’s origin and taste. 
Jon Bonne’s “The New Wine Rules: A Genuinely Helpful Guide to Everything You Need to Know” will teach you practical rules about drinking and taking care of wine without any snobbish obstacles. If you’re also interested in how climate change and sustainability fit into the wine world, this is the book for you.
Above all else, listen to the CDC
Even though wine is an alcoholic beverage, it’s no substitute for washing your hands with soap and water. I cannot believe I need to say that, but it needed to be said. 
Most importantly, I want to emphasize that social distancing and abruptly leaving USC is jarring for many people. Please remember to drink alcohol with caution, and all jokes aside, we don’t want to come out of this situation as alcoholics. There’s so much life to enjoy after all this ends!

Food waste is a growing problem in the United States. Approximately 30-40% of the total food supply goes to waste, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The issue is especially prevalent at USC, where residential dining halls and other food locations are responsible for feeding thousands of college students, employees and Los Angeles community members every day. The Food Recovery Network has found that U.S. college campuses are responsible for throwing out 22 million pounds of food each year, discarding a substantial amount of food that could have otherwise gone to students in need. Additionally, this figure points out the number of resources wasted on the production, transportation, storage and disposal of food.
However, the University has taken several steps to eliminate food waste and should continue to work to ensure that the most is made from the food that it prepares.
In 2019, Nichelle Mitchell-Huizar, sustainability administrator for USC Auxiliary Services, and Catherine Atkinson, then-director of sustainability affairs for Undergraduate Student Government, worked together to create a composting program with students who lived in Cardinal Gardens and Nemirovsky Residential College. Students learned about the types of foods that can be composted through the program. 
Composting is one way to redirect food waste from incineration or landfills, where it would otherwise be disposed of. However, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Food Recovery Hierarchy, it is the second to least preferred method of food recovery. Better methods to address food waste include decreasing the amount of food produced in the first place and using surplus food to feed hungry people. 
The EPA claims that the best way to decrease food waste is to reduce the amount of food produced at the source. However, it would likely be difficult for dining halls and campus restaurants to estimate how much food they should prepare each day considering the large and fluctuating number of people they feed. 
A good first step could be to monitor and record how much and what kinds of foods are going to waste. This would create the opportunity to learn where improvements could be made to menus and allow USC to adjust the amount of food prepared each day accordingly.
Inevitably, there will still be more food prepared than consumed. In order to reduce food waste after the fact, the University should implement a program to distribute surplus food to students who are experiencing food insecurity. According to a survey conducted in April 2019 by the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice, 45% of college students reported having faced food insecurity in the past 30 days. 
In the past, USC has partnered with St. Francis Center to redistribute excess food from dining halls to local homeless people, seniors and families in need. The University should consider creating a similar program that will redistribute food to food-insecure students on campus. This will help both reduce food waste on campus and support students in need within the community.
Dining halls can also allow students to take out the food that they do not finish. Students who have to finish their meals within short periods of time may leave behind food that they are unable to finish. If dining halls were to allow takeout, students would be able to pack up their leftover food for later as opposed to disposing of it. Not only would this decrease the amount of food waste, it would also be convenient for students who have to schedule their meals around packed academic and work schedules.
On the consumer side, USC should better inform students about the impacts of food waste on society and the environment. It may be easy to throw away a whole plate of food in the moment, but students should ultimately consider the number of resources that go into making it and the number of students who go hungry within the USC community.

Redness, breaking the skin — not just a zit or two but vast, uneven patches changing day by day. Creams, pills, cosmetics and injections — the first thing most students think when they see acne appear is “How do I stop it?”
While discouraging, adult acne is a very common struggle for college students. At USC, a wide array of resources to fight the dreaded affliction still might not be enough to keep clogged pores at bay. It is important to realize that while acne issues span topics of class and body acceptance, uneven skin is a problem that many students face well into adulthood, and individuals suffering from acne are never alone. 
During a typical semester, the Student Health Center has three dermatologists on staff and several physician’s assistants who can help with skin issues with easy weekday appointments, and the USC Health Science Campus has more professionals available to treat acne-related issues. Students can also request digital appointments with providers, a new service that was introduced in the spring this year to speed up the treatment process at USC and has been bolstered due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Acne treatments include over-the-counter creams and washes with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid and hard-to-find adapalene, a relatively gentle retinoid currently offered by only one brand in the Target skin care aisle. Patients can also request antibacterial wipes, low-dose antibiotics or harsher treatments such as Accutane injections, which require careful observation and may come with severe side effects.
But not all treatments are available for students with different insurance plans, and battling tough acne can get expensive if skincare aisle washes fail to get the job done. Many insurance plans, including the USC student health care plan, do not cover behind-the-counter adapalene without additional paperwork from a physician. 
Another option is to visit an esthetician for acne issues, but this may mean a monthly skincare regimen costing hundreds of dollars a month in addition to chemical peels costing between $100 to $5,000 per visit. No one should feel that they have to put up with acne because they cannot purchase the materials they need to feel their best.
However, does one really have to get rid of acne to feel their best? Having acne as an adult takes a lot of tough love and patience in a world that lauds clear skin, but with education and a proper attitude, both those with and without sensitive skin can learn to love and treat their skin well while dealing with this condition. 
A little acne education goes a long way. Some people are surprised to learn that acne is not contagious, and others fail to realize that some of the most intensive medications like Accutane can cause disastrous birth defects and liver damage if left unmonitored. The decision to treat, cover or flaunt acne includes many complex choices that should not be taken lightly. 
Students should feel comfortable bringing their best skin forward in a way that best suits them, regardless of class or gender. For some, this means tackling the day bare-faced, while for others, this means turning to makeup or medicine in their daily routine. Even stellar dudes who want acne relief should also be able to utilize the full arsenal of tools at their disposal, including those located in the makeup department.  
Students ought to know that they can present themselves any way they choose, even in the face of modern Photoshop and unrealistic beauty standards. Using acne patches, sporting fresh skin or using one’s face as a cosmetic canvas are all valid means of self-expression. Students should support these decisions by engaging in open communication about acne struggles and celebration based on their personalities, not their packaging. 
How students deal with their acne is their own decision. Much like appreciating one’s eye color, students are free to accept and enjoy their acne as a feature that gives them character.

USC will extend the pass/no pass deadline from April 24 to May 27, a week after final class grades are posted, President Carol Folt and Provost Charles Zukoski announced in a communitywide email Monday. Undergraduate students will also be able to have any classes taken this semester expunged from their transcripts using the no record option.
“We continue to be inspired by the resiliency of our students, faculty, and staff during this disruptive time,” the email read. “In particular, we recognize the pressures all students are experiencing, and we want to do everything we can to alleviate distress.”  
All students’ transcripts will note that the semester was disrupted due to the coronavirus pandemic. The no record option will function similarly to a withdrawal except there will be no “W” designation or record of the course on the students’ transcripts, unlike in the normal grading policy, which stipulates that students will receive a “W” on their transcripts if they drop a class after the third week of the semester. Students will still be able to elect to receive a letter grade. 
The University also announced that future applicants to USC undergraduate, graduate and professional schools would not be negatively affected by opting for pass/no pass grading for the spring semester.
“We understand students are working under unprecedented conditions, and we appreciate what they are going through,” the email read. “We are committed to evaluating all pass grades for course work without prejudice and are making this historic accommodation because we believe right now students should be able to focus on learning.”
Zukoski is working with various deans to evaluate grading options for graduate students, the email read. The grading policies will be further clarified in the frequently asked questions page on the University’s coronavirus website later this week.

NCAA spring athletes will be given an extra year of eligibility, the NCAA Division I Council announced Monday.
The ruling does not offer extended eligibility to winter athletes, including seniors and those who missed out on championship competition due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Spring student-athletes whose last year of eligibility would have been 2019-20 are not guaranteed their full scholarship next year. Schools will decide how much aid they will provide those athletes on an individual basis, ranging from the full amount they received this year to no aid at all.
Schools will be able to use the NCAA’s Student Assistance Fund to pay for scholarships for the student-athletes who choose to return for their extra year of eligibility.
“The Council’s decision gives individual schools the flexibility to make decisions at a campus level,” chair of the NCAA Division I Council M. Grace Calhoun said in a statement Monday. “The Board of Governors encouraged conferences and schools to take action in the best interest of student-athletes and their communities, and now schools have the opportunity to do that.”
The NCAA will also allow Division I rosters to carry more student-athletes on scholarship due to incoming recruits and athletes who had been in their final year of eligibility choosing to stay for another year.
In addition, baseball programs will see their roster limit expanded from 35 to a currently unspecified number. Baseball is the only spring sport with a roster limit.
USC athletic director Mike Bohn expressed his approval of the decision in a statement on Twitter Monday night.
“The last several weeks have been difficult for our student-athletes, especially the more than 50 spring sport student-athletes confronted by expiring competition eligibility,” the statement read. “I’m pleased that within three weeks of the decision to cancel spring sport championships the NCAA Division I Council voted to create the possibility for our spring sport student-athletes to compete with their teammates for an additional year. I want to thank President [Carol] Folt for partnering with me to advocate for student-athlete eligibility relief.”
USC lacrosse senior attacker Hope Anhut, who is also the president of the Trojan Athletic Senate, shared her thoughts on the NCAA’s decision Monday night via USC Women’s Lacrosse on Twitter.
“The past few weeks have been filled with uncertainty for us all, but knowing that it’s now possible to represent USC on the field again is such a gift,” Anhut said. “We are all in this together, so please support each other and most importantly, stay safe and stay healthy. As always, it is an honor and a privilege to be a part of this [Trojan] family.”
On Sunday, student-athletes from the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee representing various Power Five schools released a joint statement to recommend an extra year of eligibility for all spring athletes as well as winter athletes who did not get the chance to compete in championship play. 
“We are aware that eligibility relief presents extreme challenges for universities and the NCAA. Our job is to stand up for what we believe is right and fair for athletes,” the SAAC statement read. “Now, more than ever, it is imperative for our college athlete community to unify and support each other by standing up for what accurately represents the unified voice of college athletes.”
The NCAA Division I Council Coordination Committee had agreed to recommend eligibility relief for spring student-athletes on March 13, though until Monday, there had been no official ruling by the NCAA.
This story was updated on March 31 to reflect new information.

USC has created four funds to support the University and South Los Angeles community amid the spread of the coronavirus, President Carol Folt announced Monday in a schoolwide email. The outreach projects will fund students’ basic needs, Keck Medicine of USC’s emergency response, community support and employee assistance. 
“As we go through these times and I think of your dedication and commitment, it’s a constant reminder to me and to our entire community that we will not only weather this crisis, but we will emerge stronger,” Folt said in a video message to students, faculty and staff.
The USC Student Basic Needs Fund aims to cover student costs related to housing expenses, food insecurity, emergency travel, income loss and technology upgrades needed for remote instruction, among other financial burdens.
The USC Community Outreach Fund will provide meals to families and children living near campus, support for the elderly and people with disabilities through wellness calls and supportive outreach, job opportunities and financial resources for unemployed workers, assistance to surrounding small business and nonprofits and mental health and housing services to those in South L.A. neighborhoods. 
The fund for Keck Medicine health professionals will support those working on the front lines during the crisis. Donations will go toward purchasing masks, gloves, gowns, face shields and other personal protective equipment, along with providing ventilators and testing kits. The fund will also help bolster new quarantining areas for those in recovery who are not yet ready to return home, freeing up space for incoming patients.
The USC Employees Support Fund aims to provide aid to nearly 28,000 staff and faculty employed at the University. While USC has extended paid administrative until mid-April from the original March 26 date, the fund will serve as supplementary support for expenses such as unexpected child care and health care costs, income loss and technology requirements to work from home.

A Department of Public Safety employee has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to an email sent Sunday night from Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman and DPS Chief John Thomas to DPS personnel. 
The employee’s last shift was Wednesday, according to the email. The department has traced employees who may have had contact with the individual, notified them of the potential exposure and instructed them to monitor for coronavirus symptoms.
“As members of the Department of Public Safety, your work is essential to campus and we value your health and safety,” the email read.
DPS has enacted safety measures in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the email read. Practices implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus include checking employees’ temperatures at the start of each shift, enforcing 6-foot distances during all interactions, requiring employees to report illnesses and providing surgical masks and gloves. 
DPS employees experiencing symptoms, including fever, sore throat and difficulty breathing, are instructed to begin self-isolation and notify their supervisor. Employees who need testing for the virus can contact Student Health.
