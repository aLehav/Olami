USC baseball coach Frank Cruz is trying to treat his team’s upcoming weekend bout with No. 6 North Carolina as if it were any other series.

The Tar Heels are consistently one of the top teams in the nation and will provide a test for the Trojans (7-1) that they haven’t had to face before in 2012. The weekend series is arguably the toughest trip on USC’s schedule.
“Obviously we’re going on the road, on a long trip, and [we] need to be prepared,” Cruz said. “Every series is just another series, to be honest with you, but I’d be lying if I said this wasn’t a little different.”
The Trojans are off to their best start since 1988, when the Cardinal and Gold began the year 15-0. In 2012, USC won its first seven games of the season, including series sweeps of Jacksonville University and the University of Akron, before falling to Pepperdine on Tuesday afternoon.
The Tar Heels, however, aren’t exactly stumbling into the series. North Carolina is off to a 6-1 start, including a current streak of five straight wins heading into the showdown with USC.
“When you’re going up against a team like that, obviously, you need to show a little bit more edge,” Cruz said. “When you’re playing someone that good, I would hope that you would have that extra edge to your play.”
USC leads the all-time series with North Carolina 7-1, certainly a reflection of the Trojans’ past history of dominance over college baseball. The Tar Heels took their lone win in the series last season at Dedeaux Field by a final of 11-7.
If anything indicates that the Trojans might be ready to reverse the result from a year ago, it’s the performance of their weekend rotation to begin the 2012 season.
Friday starter Andrew Triggs and Saturday senior hurler Ben Mount are both coming off equally impressive outings, combining to pitch 15 innings with only three earned runs allowed, 11 hits, 16 strikeouts and only one walk.
Freshman pitcher Stephen Tarpley, who will likely pitch the series finale on Sunday for USC, struggled with his command in the series finale against Akron, but has 16 strikeouts in his first two career starts and has dominated hitters at times.
“We feel confident where we’re at, from a pitching standpoint,” Cruz said.
The pitching will need to be sharp to contend with the Heels, who have failed to score double digits in just two of their seven games to start the year.
In North Carolina’s most recent three-game series, against Wright State, the Tar Heels outscored their opponent 34-3 overall, including two shutouts to end the series.
“I just hope we’re ready to go out there and compete like crazy,” Cruz said. “We’re going to need to compete or else we’ll be in trouble. But I don’t have any doubt that we’ll go out there and give it all we have.”
Friday’s series opener is scheduled for a noon first pitch, with Saturday and Sunday’s games beginning at 11 a.m. and 10 a.m., respectively. Friday and Sunday’s game can both be seen on ESPN 3.
 
 
 
 
Looks like NC squeaked out a 1-0 win. A loss but a good showing against a very strong team.

Strong efforts in the three freestyle events headlined USC’s efforts at the second day of the Pac-12 championships at the East Los Angeles Swim Center in Monterey Park, Calif., on Thursday.
USC, which earned a title in the 50-yard freestyle for the first time in 16 years and barely missed titles in the 500-yard free and 200-yard free, currently sits in fourth place after the second day with 169 points. Stanford continues its chase for its 31st straight conference team championship, leading the pack with 324.5 points, followed by California with 257 points and Arizona with 181. USC is followed by Utah (114), Arizona State (108), UC Santa Barbara (107.5) and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo(67).
Sophomore Vladimir Morozov was able to bounce back from a second-place finish to current California senior Nathan Adrian in the 50-yard freestyle in last year’s conference championships, earning the top qualifier in prelims (19.46) and beating out Stanford junior Aaron Wayne by .07 seconds (19.48 to 19.55), to win USC’s first 50-yard freestyle conference title since 1996. Morozov’s win also extends USC’s current streak of 16-straight years with at least one conference title.
Senior Jeff Daniels also earned a second swim in the race, winning the “C” final in 19.82, which would have earned him a spot in the “A” final in prelims and placed fourth in the final.
The team of Morozov, sophomore Dimitri Colupaev, sophomore Jack Wagner and Daniels almost ended USC’s drought in the 200-yard freestyle. The Trojans were .04 seconds from winning their first title in the event since 1996, finishing just behind Stanford’s 1:17.92 with a time of 1:17.96.
Morozov led the event with a season-best 19.27, and Daniels passed California on the final leg to move the Trojans up from third to second. Cal finished in 1:18.13.
The 500-yard final proved to be a tight four-man race between Quintero, Bobrosky and Stanford’s Chad La Tourette and David Mosko. Mosko led the event after 300 yards and was overcome by teammate La Tourette after 350, with Bobrosky sitting in third. Bobrosky jumped up to second at 400 yards and remained there at 450, while Quintero moved up to third. La Tourette was able to maintain his lead over the past 150 yards, winning the event in 4:17.38. Quintero’s second-place finish of 4:17.83 earned USC’s best time in the event this year and an NCAA “B” cut. Bobrosky dropped to fifth (4:19.93), falling behind Mosko (4:18.00) and Stanford’s Bryan Offutt (4:18.77).
USC senior Julian Bonse and sophomore Nick Johnson both earned personal records in the event, finishing 11th (4:21.27) and 15th (4:25.63), respectively. Bonse’s time was also an NCAA “B” cut.
In the 200-yard individual medley prelims, junior Alex Lendrum fell .54 short of qualifying for the final. Lendrum, one of the top seeds in the event, took second in the consolation final with a time of 1:46.73 (10th overall). Sophomore Sean Mulroy made his postseason scoring debut with a PR of 1:48.66 and a 16th-place finish, while Wagner and junior Justin DiFederico finished 20th (1:49.25) and 24th (1.51.73), respectively.
The Pac-12 championships continue Friday and Saturday, with prelims starting at 11 a.m. and finals at 6 p.m. on both days.

USC continued its hot streak heading into the postseason with a 62-55 victory over the Washington Huskies.  The Women of Troy strengthened its position as the third place team in the Pac-12 by withstanding a cold shooting streak in the second half.
Finishing strong · Freshman guard Ariya Crook scored four points against Washington Thursday. USC plays Washington State Saturday. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
 
Led by junior forward Christina Marinacci’s 19 points and 12 rebounds, USC finished the game on a 10-2 run after falling behind 53-52 with just over three minutes to play.
The game was back and forth in the middle stages. USC was able to goad the Huskies into 19 turnovers while only committing 11 of their own.
The Women of Troy took control in the second half with a 10-1 run with 8:22 to play in the game.  USC’s bench was key in this game, with freshman guard Ariya Crook and sophomore forward Desire Bradley making key plays in the second half.  The run was thanks to a scoring drought by Washington that spanned over four minutes.
Senior guard Briana Gilbreath continued her stellar play, finishing a well-rounded game with 15 points, six rebounds, four assists, and three steals. She also added one block.
In the first half, USC out-shot Washington, making 39 percent of its shots from the floor compared to the Huskies’ 36 percent.  This led to a 34-25 halftime lead that would be depleted in the second half when Washington started off on a 6-0 run.
USC was able to hang on just enough in the face of Washington’s scorching 63 percent shooting percentage in the second half.  In the nail-biting final minutes, Gilbreath put the Women of Troy ahead by making two free throws with less than two minutes left in the game.  After a crucial defensive stop on the next possession, USC scored to make it a two-possession game, effectively sealing the victory.
With the exception of Stanford, USC is arguably the hottest team in the conference heading into the Pac-12 Tournament.
With just one regular season left to play at Washington State, USC has now won five games in a row, a streak it  hopes to continue all the way to an NCAA tournament berth.  Such an accomplishment would be the first time in coach Michael Cooper’s tenure that the Women of Troy appear in the chase for the national championship.
Tip-off for Saturday’s game is scheduled for 1:00 p.m. in Pullman, Washington.

It’s been a long detour from success for USC’s storied baseball team.
Gone are the days of Mark Prior, Barry Zito and Ian Kennedy. Gone are the back-to-back national championships. Gone are winning seasons in general. With USC’s last postseason appareance in 2005, the past five years have not been kind to this USC squad, which has struggled to find consistency on the field and in management.
The team’s legacy — you know, the one represented by twice as many national titles  (12) as the next closest schools, Texas and Louisiana State University — has taken a severe hit as a result.
Not many people at this university see Trojan baseball as the powerhouse program it once was, and the same can be said for much of the top talent looking to be recruited out of high school by programs promising wins and national exposure.
It must come as a bit of a surprise to many people to learn that USC’s current ball club is in the process of kicking their recent losing habits. With a 7-1 record to open the year, the Trojans are off to its best start since 1988 — and they have looked impressive in the process.
A major reason for the turnaround has been a visible improvement on the mound. With a starting rotation anchored by seniors Andrew Triggs and Ben Mount, and a bullpen showing vast improvements in consistency over last year, the Trojans have managed a collective 2.79 ERA and 80 strikeouts over 71 innings.
It hasn’t hurt that the offense has shown up too. USC has scored eight or more runs in five of its eight games thus far, amassing 60 runs on the season.
Senior Matt Foat has led the charge, hitting .424 with a home run and seven RBI, and sophomore Kevin Swick has a .464 average and has knocked in five RBI in the process.
Certainly all positives for a team that finished seventh in the Pac-10 last season with a 25-31 record. But as is to be expected of a youthful team looking to bounce back into competitive form, this early start should be taken as just that — an early start.
With Jacksonville University, Long Beach State and Akron, the Trojans haven’t exactly faced powerhouse ball clubs in their seven wins, and their one loss to Pepperdine was fairly decisive.
With a road trip to face No. 5 North Carolina this weekend, USC will meet its toughest challenge of the season at a point where the team is still working to get a full sense of its strengths and abilities.
And though the Trojans have gotten solid production from many of their veterans so far, USC’s chances of turning this initial progress into season-long success relies squarely on the freshman class to pull its weight accordingly.
Some have already stepped up — freshman relief pitcher Wyatt Strahan has gone 5.2 innings without allowing a run, while highly touted infielder Dante Flores has already recorded a triple and a pair of RBIs in just four games — but many others, namely freshman starting pitcher Stephen Tarpley, have yet to show they are fully ready to compete at the college level.
Cruz, in only his second year at the helm of the Trojans, has shown he knows how to win at USC.
But with his relative inexperience as coach and the range of youth in front of him, there remain several uncertainties about the staying power of this early success.
If the Trojans can maintain the same composure they’ve shown in the beginning of the season and continue to form a new identity around winning baseball games, consistency will eventually come.
But only in that long-term maturation process will the proper foundation be formed upon which winning seasons can build on.
Until then, a return to tradition still seems distant.

I have to disagree with you about the relative inexperience of head coach Cruz. He was an asst. for four years under Gillespie in the mid nineties once reaching the championship game in the CWS ( 1995). He was the Head Coach of LMU for twelve years. That is not the main issue, it is recruiting the best who do not turn pro out of high
school, and developing some players that have not peaked before college.

It wasn’t exactly the start the USC men’s basketball team had hoped for.
In it together · Junior center James Blasczyk and freshman guard Byron Wesley were unable to lead the Trojans to their second Pac-12 win. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
Facing first-place Washington, the Trojans (6-24, 1-16) gave up a season-high 40 points in the first half before eventually falling by a score of 80-58 — their eighth consecutive loss and 16th in the last 17 games.
The Huskies, who clinched a share of the Pac-12 regular season title on Thursday, started the game on a 13-4 run, silencing much of the announced crowd of 2,763 at the Galen Center. USC would, as a result, struggle to recover.
“They have too much for us,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “Top to bottom, they have experience. If I was going to be in the NCAA tournament, I wouldn’t want to play those guys. They’ve gotten better. They’ve improved.”
Despite the discrepancy in talent, the Trojans would whittle away at the Huskies’ 14-point halftime lead — at least somewhat in the early goings of the second half. Following a made free throw from junior center James Blasczyk with 13:03 left in game, they trailed by just nine, the lowest since the 13-minute mark of the first half.
But on its next three possessions, the Huskies amassed seven points, ballooning its lead to a near-insurmountable 16-point-advantage midway through the final period.
“We needed to get it to five to have a chance,” O’Neill said. [They] stretched it out and made it hard for us.”
Guard Terrence Ross, who finished with a team-high 18 points started the 7-0 run with a 3-pointer, followed by a pair of baskets from guard C.J. Wilcox and center Aziz N’Diaye.
Making things even tougher for the Trojans’ comeback hopes was rebounding, or more so a lack thereof, as they were out-rebounded 49-23.
“We miss so many shots that people get more defensive rebounds,” O’Neill said. “And tonight, they’re just bigger and stronger than us at every position. That’s all there is to it. We don’t have the capability to outrebound people right now.”
One player who didn’t miss much was freshman guard Byron Wesley, who notched a career-high 23 points — the second straight game he finished with more than 20.
“There’s definitely some positives of our situation,” said Wesley, who hoisted 18 shot attempts. “I’m getting lots of minutes and touches. But at the end of the day, we want to win games.”
Over the last three games, he has averaged 21 points.
“I really like how he attacks the basket,” O’Neill said. “If he becomes a knock-down shooter, he’ll be a guy who can play for a long, long time.”
Wesley was among three Trojans to finish in double-figures. Sophomore forward Garrett Jackson finished with 14 points, the seventh time in his last 12 starts he has finished with more than 10 points, and Blasczky had 10 — a career-high. Sophomore guard Maurice Jones also chipped in with four assists.
The Trojans conclude the regular season on Saturday against Washington State at the Galen Center. The game is scheduled to tip-off at 3 p.m. and will be streamed on       USCTrojans.com. O’Neill’s squad has not won since Jan. 28 and will look to notch what would be its second win in conference play.
“Nobody is enjoying this, let’s face it,” O’Neill said. “But it is what it is.”
USC lost to the Cougars (14-15, 6-11) 60-53 earlier this season in Pullman, Wash.

USC’s video game design program was ranked No. 1 by The Princeton Review for the third year in a row, the university announced Thursday.
Both the graduate and undergraduate programs have held the top spot since the Review began publishing the list in 2010. USC retained its spot as more video game programs formed around the country, and the list of top schools increased from 30 to 50.
The Games program is a joint program between the Interactive Media Division of the School of Cinematic Arts and the computer science department of the Viterbi School of Engineering, although the interactive entertainment degree is granted by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in conjunction with the School of Cinematic Arts.
Tracy Fullerton, chair of the SCA’s IMD and the USC Game Innovation Lab Director, said USC’s multidisciplinary approach has allowed the university to stay on top.
“USC comes out on top because of our focus on the artistry of game design,” Fullerton told USA Today. “Our faculty and students see beyond the trappings of technology and we are constantly driving the form forward.”
On the undergraduate list, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ranked second and the University of Utah ranked third. The graduate list ranked Rochester Institute of Technology second and MIT third. Other than MIT and USC, Carnegie Mellon (No. 6 on the graduate list) was the only other institution also in U.S. News and World Report’s top 25 universities.

National Institutes of Health funding for research at USC increased more than 10 percent over the 2011 fiscal year, primarily because of new research facilities and projects.
USC received $202 million in NIH funding, and its funding ranks 11th among all private higher education institutions, according to the NIH.
NIH grants are used to support the direct and indirect costs of research and are awarded to USC for use by faculty members and administration.
Elizabeth Fini, vice dean for research at the Keck School of Medicine, said the increase in NIH funding can be attributed to the construction of the new research facilities the university added over the last year.
“We received 14 percent more funding than last year when counting grants from all sponsors,” Fini said. “This can be attributed to the opening of four new research buildings and the recruitment of a new generation of researchers into these new facilities, thus expanding the number of research faculty who are competitive for grants.”
Part of the new funding from the NIH will be used for the construction and development of the National Cancer Institute Physical Science-Oncology Center at USC, Fini said.
“Recently the National Cancer Institute of the NIH designated USC as one of 12 Physical Science-Oncology Centers across the country and funded the program with a $16-million grant to be used over five years,” Fini said. “The five-year grant will allow [researchers] to focus on creating a set of virtual cancer models based on measurements from individual cancer patients, [and] the models then would be used to simulate cancer growth and predict drug responses for each patient.”
Fini said that given the current budget cuts in the federal government, NIH funding for the 2012 fiscal year will not increase as substantially as in 2011.
“We have some catching up to do, and times are tough at NIH,” Fini said. “Nevertheless, the Keck School has taken a positive stance, [and] we are projecting a 1 to 3 percent increase [in funding] in parallel with the 2012 NIH budget increase.”
Because of the predicted decrease in the growth of funding from the NIH, Fini said this year the university will try to increase its research funding from other foundations and corporations.
“We also receive funding from foundations, such as the American Cancer Society, Autism Speaks and Fight for Sight,” Fini said. “Industry sponsorship is currently a small part of our portfolio, but we see this as an opportunity to expand and fill the gap opened by difficult times at NIH.”
Kelsi Chesney, an undeclared freshman, said the university’s increased funding from the NIH shows the growth of USC as a private research university.
“I’m excited that USC keeps securing more funding from the NIH because it shows that [the university] really cares about its student and faculty research projects,” Chesney said.

USC’s National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events held an informational session to increase awareness on campus and to recruit potential researchers on Thursday.
Securing information · Stephen Hora, director of the USC Homeland Security Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events, tells students about the type of research the center conducts. - Zhiyi Feng | Daily Trojan
CREATE, operated jointly by the Sol Price School of Public Policy and Viterbi School of Engineering, is the first of 12 Centers of Excellence, sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, in the country.
With 30 research projects a year, CREATE trains more than 100 students in homeland security issues. It provides education opportunities for graduate students looking to specialize in homeland security and to earn professional certifications, CREATE Director Stephen Hora said.
Some of their current projects include partnerships with the NFL regarding stadium security and with the Transportation Security Administration concerning airport security. Recently, CREATE studied the effects of a hypothetical anthrax attack on Seattle. Their findings helped determine how to minimize the damages that would be done to the people as well as the economy, Hora said.
The brainchild of Randolph Hall, senior vice president for research at USC, CREATE began as a response to 9/11 and quickly developed into an active presence in the United States’ counter-terrorism effort.
“Randy Hall’s idea was, ‘Let’s not just react, let’s engage in deep interdisciplinary research to solve the problem and mindset to prevent the terrorism events,’” said Gisele Ragusa, the associate director of education at CREATE. “Instead of just reacting we have to be proactive and we need to do this kind of proactive work by engaging in comprehensive inter-disciplinary research.”
USC worked with the Department of Homeland Security to develop the idea for the center, which works with institutions in the states and abroad. The mission of the Homeland Security Centers of Excellence is to produce ideas, technology and research for the Department of Homeland Security.
CREATE aims to evaluate the risk and consequences of terrorism both to United States’ society and economy in an attempt to prevent future attacks.
“This issue is not going to go away unless we confront it from the standpoint of research. We need to begin to understand both psychologically, economically and in terms of strategy how terrorists think and operate and we need to do that using contemporary research with an interdisciplinary focus across engineering, public policy, economics, psychology, statistics, etc.,” Ragusa said.
Samrat Chatterjee, a postdoctoral research associate at CREATE, said the work is fulfilling.
“It’s not just making the country secure,” Chatterjee said. “At times people feel that they can contribute to some sort of greater good. … If your efforts or research can lead to a more secure campus, community or society, that’s something that can get [people] motivated to at least get interested in knowing more.”

A team of 10 USC students will compete at the White House to win $100,000 from the U.S. Department of Energy on Friday.
The team, made up of graduate student members of the USC Student Energy Club, entered the DOE-sponsored Better Buildings Case Competition in early February.
The competition centers on two student-created proposals for making an office building and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the U.S. Army’s flagship medical center in Washington, D.C., more energy efficient.
The team will see if four weeks of hard work will pay off Friday, when they present their project in front of a panel of energy experts in Washington.
Nineteen universities, including UCLA and UC Berkeley, are participating in the challenge.
Because the competition involves elements of architecture, engineering, finance and public policy, the students on USC’s team come from a diverse group of backgrounds.
Of the 10 team members, two are MBA students, one is a public policy student, three are architects and four are engineers.
Members of the team credit each person’s different area of expertise with their ability to compete.
“When we started working on this, we saw engineering students weren’t enough and that we needed help,” said Riddhi Ray, a graduate student studying electrical engineering. “Having people from different walks of life really helps.”
The ability to hand off tasks to someone with a better understanding of that particular topic also made them more efficient as a whole, said Elliot Weinstock, a graduate student studying business administration.
“The engineers did the energy model and passed off the outputs for me to find out what made sense financially,” Weinstock said. “We knew which person was better with each task.”
This ability to use everyone’s knowledge to the team’s benefit also helped them learn from one another, Weinstock said.
“At the end of the day, if you had to ask one of them about the financial aspects, they’d be able to tell you plenty about that,” Weinstock said. “If you asked me I would able to tell you about the engineering systems, which is something I didn’t know about before.”
Though the students on the team differ in their areas of study, their common interest in creating efficient, sustainable energy pulls them together.
“We really can’t keep doing things the way we have been … with natural resources running out, we just need to leave a better future for everyone and we need to start working toward that now,” said Nadine Mackenzie, a graduate student studying green technology. “That is what this competition is about, finding sustainable solutions for building projects.”
The idea of challenging the way society currently looks at saving energy cropped up as several students’ motivation.
“For me, it’s being able to tie everything together and show practically how you can make green energy work,” Weinstock said. “We’re starting off with, ‘To hell with LEED and to hell with the environment, we’re here to save you some money.’”
The professional quality that teams strive for in their proposals is also valuable to students who want to enter the field.
“In my classes, we are getting a lot of introduction to these high-level concepts, but through this competition, we have had to translate that into actual implementation,” said Sarah Dominguez, a graduate student studying planning. “I enjoy actually learning how these ideas of energy efficiency and water management can be put into use in real urban planning.”
Riddhi Ray!!! congrats broooo!!!! m sooo damn excited n happy!!!

Disillusioned by pressures and expectations from big corporations, many bands and artists are now attempting to leave record labels behind and adopt a do-it-yourself spirit.
And this trend is sparking creativity and spontaneity — the elements needed to make music so much fun in the first place. Without major labels, bands have no deadlines, no quotas and no false imaging. Bands get to be themselves and get their work done on their own time.
Of course, branching off and starting a record label is no easy feat, and leaving behind a major label introduces a whole new set of challenges.
The biggest loss is distribution. Record labels often handle the physical production of CDs and ship them to online vendors and retail stores.
Without a record label, bands have to deal with getting their digital files pressed onto an album, creating the artwork for the record and distributing it internationally. But doing so makes the process much more rewarding.
Look at ska-punk band Less Than Jake, which formed its own record label, Sleep It Off Records, in 2008. Immediately after doing so, the band re-released its past albums from Warner Bros. Records and a brand-new CD, GNV FLA — named after the band members’ hometown and label’s headquarters in Gainesville, Fla.
They began really enjoying the freedom their independent venture afforded them. The liberty inspired them to release a playful EP of covers, TV/EP, all based on the theme songs from popular television shows.
Normally a staple of the band’s live shows, this EP would likely have never been given the green light from a major label. It lacks any singles and clocks in under 12 minutes with a 16-song tracklisting.
Not only did the band release its own EPs, but it began to do so with no talk about release dates or prior promotions. Essentially, fans could wake up one day and unexpectedly find a new EP from Less Than Jake.
The second of these surprise releases came out Feb. 16. Titled Seasons Greetings from Less Than Jake, this companion piece to the Greetings from Less Than Jake EP released in summer 2011 surprised fans and featured some of the band’s best material yet.
The songs sound energetic and naturally inspired, which are factors that major record labels tend to neglect in favor of creating the most surefire revenue-generating radio hit for their artists.
Even industry veterans have been inspired to join the DIY cause. Mötley Crüe has its own record label, Mötley Records, which handles the releases of its material in conjunction with Eleven Seven Music.
Mötley Crüe’s bassist Nikki Sixx is even the president of Eleven Seven Music and many of the band’s closest musical friends have switched to the label. Among the converts are rock groups Buckcherry and Papa Roach.
For Papa Roach, the label allowed the band the freedom to release a hybrid album in 2010 titled Time for Annihilation of new studio material and live recordings. And now, the band has been working on recording its first full-length release for Eleven Seven Music.
And, as can be expected, the creative juices appear to be flowing even more smoothly. Vocalist Jacoby Shaddix has stated that this upcoming release, which should come out later this year, will be the album of the band’s career, and further elaboration in an interview with NME yielded this insight: “The new album will be ‘aggressive and uplifting’ as well as ‘out of the norm’ and different to their previous, nu-metal skewed work.”
What these examples showcase is that bands are often better off on their own. Sure, it is scary and daunting at first, but the challenge tends to inspire the greatest creativity and the most loyal support.
Fans can rejoice in knowing that there was no outside influence from label executives or forced collaborations; everything on self-released records is 100 percent accomplished by the band.
When bands can leave behind deadlines and corporate meetings, they can truly be themselves, unmanaged by an outside entity. And when that happens, they can only be at their peak, as long as they push themselves there with their innate passions for their craft.
The takeaway message here is that bands will no doubt have difficulty releasing material on their own, but the risks and challenges of doing so will pay off as long as they can persevere.

Stepping off the elevator to the sound of Steven Tyler belting out “Livin’ on the Edge” over the intercom is a perfect start to the exhibit Trouble in Paradise: Music and Los Angeles, 1945-1975, currently featured at the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live.
History lesson · “Search for Weapons, Watts Riots” (1966) by Cliff Wesselman shows Los Angeles police searching black men in the 1900 block of East 103rd Street. Trouble in Paradise: Music and Los Angeles will be on display at the Grammy Museum through June 3. - Photo courtesy of Herald Examiner Collection/Los Angeles Public Library
The gallery explores the development of music in Los Angeles from 1945-1975 and the interaction between music and culture. The exhibit originated at USC, in an undergraduate communications class at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism under the supervision of Professor Josh Kun.
His goal was to give an arc of different periods in American history — a picture of cultural politics and social unrest.
“1975 provided a good stopping point for our timeline,” Kun said. “We wanted to stop before disco, funk and punk really changed the narrative of music.”
Thirty years offers quite a variety of music to pull from for curation, and if the exhibit suffers from anything, it’s the vast scale of the material that it attempts to fuse into one space. Pulling from R&B, jazz, beach party, Chicano, gospel, folk and rock genres, each section of the exhibit could stand as a collection of its own; however, each segment brilliantly captures music’s relationship to society, justice and other contemporary concerns.
USC students developed some of the key pieces that elevate the exhibit from a run-of-the-mill museum tour through time to an interactive, engaging space. Kun, acting as a guest curator for the Grammy Museum, said that his favorite student idea — a revamped 1970s jukebox — became an exemplary feature of Trouble in Paradise.
The jukebox features approximately 90 MP3s for passers-by to choose from and offers vitality to the exhibit, as it never allows the space to sink into a quiet, dreary museum feel. And its inclusion is fitting: According to Kun, one of the biggest shifts in music was the disappearance of the jukebox.
“In the heyday of jukeboxes, people would make a public choice and have to live with it. Everyone knew who picked what song,” Kun said. “It gave people the opportunity to learn to be in each other’s presence through music.”
Another central piece of the exhibit is a timeline comparing moments of social and political importance with chronologically corresponding albums and music memorabilia. The piece strives to show that constructed environments, public policy and music have a symbiotic relationship in culture.
One part of this timeline, highlighting the mid – to late-1960s, showcases newspaper clippings of the Sunset Strip riots and The Doors’ nightclub debut at the London Fog. These sections are set up with headphones and a selection of six songs, giving viewers the opportunity to consider the evolution of music throughout the period.
In particular, the exhibit’s undertone of police aggression acts as a connective theme and is perhaps best exemplified in the 1966 Freakout Hot Spots! map from Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, which highlighted areas of high LAPD activity.
“It has died out, but Los Angeles is always reliable for police brutality,” Kun said. “It won’t go away, and as we can see here at the exhibit, culture comes out of that clash.”
Major cultural seismic shocks that changed Los Angeles’ image are displayed throughout Kun’s vision of “L.A.’s quaking racial fault lines,” such as the 1965 riots and the 1970 Chicano anti-Vietnam demonstration that turned violent. Notably, though, Kun gives the most significance to the 1969 Charles Manson murders.
“Just look at the evolution of Laurel Canyon folk singers. In the late 1960s, the Mamas & the Papas were singing ‘Safe in my Garden,’ this bucolic, happy song; 1969 and Manson come along, and then the 1970s bring Jackson Browne’s ‘Before the Deluge,’” Kun said. “It’s the end of innocence — innocence and hope to fear and paranoia.”
Maybe the greatest L.A. concept the exhibit explores is the advent of the car. At the end of the exhibit, a car that’s been converted into a couch sits in the center of the room while a projection of music performances, L.A. imagery and photo compilations showcase the relationship between the car and music.
Surrounding the couch are pieces from Radio DJ Art Laboe’s late 1950s to early 1970s drive-in radio show at Scrivener’s Drive-In. Pieces include albums, photographs and the very microphone that he used on the show.
Laboe, one of the first DJs to play rock music in the Western United States, was on site for the exhibit’s opening.
“It felt like overnight we moved from Doris Day to Elvis, from big bands to rock ‘n’ roll,” Laboe said.
An informational placard at the beginning of the exhibit denotes that a goal of the exhibit is to “listen to the heart of the city in the songs it sang,” and the exhibit certainly does not disappoint.
From handwritten lyrics of Ritchie Valens, depictions of the Watts Towers as album iconography and videos of the 1965 Watts Riot paired with background music of the era, the exhibit is approachable from various perspectives and makes viewers appreciate contemporary music’s place in an ever-lengthening timeline.

America’s eccentric troupe of swim-capped crusaders is donning its collective spandex once again. The Aquabats, that endearing and addictive band of musical superheroes, is suiting up for a new adventure: The Aquabats! Super Show!
The series, which kicks off March 3 on The Hub, will follow the band as it mixes song-and-dance routines with misadventures and crimefighting, somewhat akin to the Monkees’ eponymous sitcom in the mid-1960s.
“A lot like The Monkees’ show meets … Batman,” said Christian Jacobs, executive producer and lead vocalist of The Aquabats. “But [it’s] also inspired by Flight of the Conchords — Power Rangers meets Batman meets Flight of the Conchords. There’s a lot of strange, wonderful, weird things that are happening.”
It’s a natural step for the band, which has been making weird things happen with one lineup or another since 1994. After all, The Aquabats built their image around a mythology of costumes, characters and the idea of fighting evil with music.
“We always thought this would be a cool kids show,” Jacobs said. “The inspiration for the band, anyway, was wacky television kids shows, fighting monsters and being goofy … [it’s] a good 15 years [that] we’ve been trying to make this happen.”
The Aquabats’ fans will immediately recognize the show’s starring characters: MC Bat Commander (Jacobs), Crash McLarson (bassist Chad Larson), Jimmy the Robot (keyboard and sax player James Briggs), Ricky Fitness (drummer Ricky Falomir) and Eagle “Bones” Falconhawk (guitarist and recent find Ian Fowles), all in their signature caps and goggles. But that’s not all.
“I guess the sixth Aquabat is Battletram, this big motorhome we drive around in,” Jacobs said. “In a lot of ways, it’s very Scooby-Doo.”
Each episode will run about 20 minutes and feature a mix of live action and interstitial cartoons, including fake, SNL-style commercial breaks. The soundtrack will be composed of familiar Aquabats staples and new songs written for each show.
And for the most part, viewers can expect a different and fantastical monster for the crew to face in every episode: Jacobs confirmed there will be battles with bad guys ranging from giant mole rats to mummies.
“The villains look right out of a Jim Henson muppet movie,” said network publicist JP Shields.
Jacobs also jokingly speculated about the increased risk for band-wide heart attacks that could result from a hectic schedule while filming a second season — principal photography is complete for 13 episodes, but the show’s future is still undecided.
“Every week I come to the conclusion that this is the most ridiculous thing ever,” Jacobs said. “Crash was covered in gophers and was supposed to jump into this really gross pond. It was cold. He was afraid of catching a disease … Eagle Bones got whipped in the eye by a giant laundry monster.
“We’re not 20-year-olds anymore, you know? We’re not in the best shape … I guess that’s part of the comedy, these out-of-shape guys trying to fight monsters. But we’d love to keep doing it forever.”
At the moment, what’s standing in the way of forever is the budget. The show is built around comically simplistic stunts and special effects, but songstress Dolly Parton might have said it best when she quipped,  “It costs a lot of money to look this cheap.”
Jacobs half-jokingly alluded to bake sales to pay for extra special effects, which account for the bulk of the expense, but believes it’s worth it to render the show’s unique look — so long as viewers understand that.
“That’s the only thing we’re a little nervous about,” Jacobs said. “That it’s supposed to look a little janky. It’s not like we can compete with, you know, Transformers, and we don’t want to. But I think kids today are hipper to irony and sarcasm.”
The Hub caters traditionally to children ages six to 11, and The Aquabats! Super Show! is, on the surface, written for kids. But Jacobs and company believe the series, like so many before it, has the potential for a greater audience.
“All the good stuff, like SpongeBob [Squarepants], is aimed at kids,” Jacobs said. “It’s definitely silly, but I think it will pick up an adult following as well.  We try to tap into that 11-year-old, pure kid mentality. That doesn’t really ever leave you.”
 
The Aquabats! Super Show! premieres March 3 at 10 a.m. PST.  on The Hub.

After the success of Horton Hears a Who! (2008) it was only a matter of time before another beloved work of Dr. Seuss would be transformed into a feat of computer-animated giddiness.
Eco-friendly · Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda’s cinematic interpretation of The Lorax makes a blatant political statement as the Lorax, voiced by Danny DeVito, fights to protect his world from destruction. - Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment
 
Sure enough, there’s The Lorax, with a screenplay by Cinco Paul and Ken Duario — the same duo behind Horton — that does justice to the source material while providing a suitable adaptation for modern audiences.
“Every single page in the book is represented in the movie,” Paul said, who wanted to capture all the appeal of his favorite Seuss story.
The original book tells the tale of a young boy who visits the shadowy Once-ler in the hopes of learning what made the land around him so barren, a sight that “really haunted” Paul when he was younger.
The Once-ler relates how he ignored the advice of the Lorax, a diminutive, mustachioed nature spirit who “speaks for the trees.” And in his greed, the Once-ler cut down the entire forest.

It was difficult for Paul and Duario to expand that simple premise at first, but they eventually succeeded by exploring the story of the boy, named Ted (Zac Efron) in the film, as he seeks out a tree to impress his crush Audrey (Taylor Swift).
The two live in “Thneedville,” a sugary-sweet and heavily polluted town whose inhabitants don’t seem to care that they live under the thumb of a totalitarian businessman. The inclusion of Ted and Audrey’s story, combined with the classic tale of the Lorax and the Once-ler, form a cohesive, modern whole with a more blatant pro-environmental message than Wall-E.
This theme comes from the original book, which strongly considered the dangers that industry and consumerism posed to the environment. Though Seuss claimed “kids can see a moral coming a mile away,” there’s no denying that The Lorax remains his most heavy-handed parable.
And that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If this new take on the story is trying to be an environmental tale tailored to the current political environment, it entirely succeeds.
And though Paul says they “weren’t making an anti-industry movie, but a pro-responsible industry movie” the claim of a moderate approach rings a bit hollow when viewing the film’s bombastically catchy villain song “How Bad Can I Be?”— a no-holds-barred skewering of the attitudes held by corporate America, replete with headlines proclaiming that the Once-ler is “too big to fail.”
That said, Daurio was right when he pointed out that “nobody wants to get yelled at for 90 minutes.” And sure enough, The Lorax is the most relentlessly polished, cheery exposition against boundless consumerism that anyone could ask for.
The visuals are dazzling, fitting for one of Seuss’s first books to move away from his standard red and blue palette, and the character design is superb. The bears and fish of the forest in particular are this film’s requisite avatars of animated adorableness, and they certainly do the trick.
The voice acting is spot-on as well; Danny DeVito is a brilliant fit as the Lorax and Ed Helms makes for a perfect Once-ler, even going so far as to perform the music the character plays.
The studio was “worried about this becoming a musical,” but The Lorax does have some musical numbers. So to ensure that the film wouldn’t have a “musical” stigma attached to it, neither Ted nor Audrey sing in the film, even though their voice actors are especially vocally adept.
Nevertheless, it works for the story being told, and as a smartly executed animated feature that commits fully to its message, The Lorax is a nice treat for audiences of all ages.
I love the work that Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio did on The Lorax.  Excellent film!

Rick Santorum’s most recent grievance with the state of American politics is that colleges deliberately create hostile environments for conservative students.
Santorum stated on the ABC’s program This Week that right-leaning students on college campuses must contend “with an ideology that is forced upon people” who do not agree with the more prevalent left.
Is he not advocating a forced ideology by suggesting that colleges need to change in order to be more open to conservatives? Does that not tamper with the natural status quo at colleges nationwide?
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
It is hard to argue that conservatives are not underrepresented among college students — particularly social conservatives. According to a fall 2011 survey conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA, 27.6 percent of incoming freshman described themselves as “liberal” while 20.7 percent identified as “conservative.”
Conservative college students might be outnumbered, but they are not marginalized. Is there going to be more liberal sentiment expressed on college campuses? Yes. But the same goes for conservative opinion in a Baptist parish: Given the background and sentiments of the people who comprise that particular community, one would expect the liberal voice to be far less prominent.
And just as Baptist parish members aren’t tripping over one another to embrace the liberal point of view, liberal college students should not be expected to specifically cater to the needs of their conservative peers. We’re all adults here; simply as a function of numbers, the conservatives among us might have a harder time finding political allies, but no one needs to take special care of them.
Moreover, to argue that conservative college students are not allowed to express their opinions or are treated contemptuously by the rest of the student body is to ignore the strong evidence of conservative student input at institutions across the country.
At USC, for example, conservative student organizations, such as the College Republicans and ‘SC Students for Israel, have considerable student and institutional respect.
The only time when conservatives might be marginalized at USC and other colleges is when their principles lead them to a behavior directly at odds with the school’s mission or policies. For example, a staunch social conservative would probably not be permitted to start a USC anti-LGBT club, because discrimination based on sexual orientation is not tolerated on our campus.
In cases such as these, conservatives can raise no complaint. Their enrollment at college implies an agreement to adhere to university policy, even where it might deviate from one’s personal political views.
No person or entity is currently tampering with the political equilibrium at American colleges — and that’s exactly how it should be. Conservatives are just as welcome to express their opinions as liberals, and they do not need special privileges just because they represent the minority view.

One of the reasons I wanted to attend USC was because I was under the impression there is a relatively close 50:50 ratio of conservatives to progressives on this campus and so far that has more or less been my experience. Professors here, especially in philosophy classes, do a good job of not inserting their own beliefs to discussion and instead letting students come to their own conclusions and openly debate their stances on various political or moral issues against eachother. Isn’t that really the most ideal learning environment for students in the classroom? It is rather off-putting when a professor inserts their own left or right leaning opinion because it taints the rest of the discussion this might influence students who have not solidly formed their own beliefs yet in a biased manner.
That being said, Rick Santorum is an idiot and the GOP need to embrace a more moderate candidate if they plan to lure centrist/left-leaning voters and win this coming November.
Congratulations, Francesca! As a fellow Trojan, I’d like to be the first to pat you on the back for mastering the art of the red herring. The way you made it seem like belonging to a church was in any way similar to dealing with a liberal professor who creates an atmosphere that stifles debate was masterful. I also like the leap in logic (i.e., because Santorum believes leftist ideology is forced upon conservatives that he would favor some sort of right wing social conservative agenda on the rest of the student body if given the chance).
Did I want to be treated with kid gloves when I was on campus just under a decade ago? No. In fact, I love a good debate. I do have one request, though: If you’re going to talk about how respected conservative groups on campus are, it’s probably a good idea not to be so sloppy as to link to College Republicans from…South Carolina.
The college republicans link is for the OTHER sc.  Where can I find the Trojan group?

In keeping with a tradition of making far-fetched and controversial claims, Rick Santorum called President Barack Obama a “snob” for encouraging all Americans to go to college. He further accused universities of attempting to indoctrinate people with liberal values.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
Though the comment sounds too much like a poorly thought-out conspiracy theory to be taken at face value, the deeper point that Santorum was trying to make holds some truth.
In an interview on ABC’s This Week on Sunday, Santorum spoke against the “politically correct left doctrine” at universities and advocated for more conservative Christian principles in institutions of higher education. The problem is not nearly as extreme as Santorum makes it out to be, but it is true that conservative students, especially those with Christian backgrounds, tend to feel as if their views are invalid in universities like USC.
As a university, USC encourages inquiry and the free exchange of ideas. Many students, however, have not followed the university’s lead.
When politics comes up in a conversation and a student mentions his or her conservatism, that person often becomes the rhetorical punching bag of the conversation.
Apparently, since the student is a conservative — or even more objectionable, a conservative Christian — his or her viewpoint is no longer valid.
Students who criticize others for their conservative beliefs must respect these other views and learn from them. In doing so, we can foster a more accepting and vibrant political atmosphere.
Contrary to what Santorum argues, the bias against conservative Christians is not an entirely institutional one, at least not at USC. A couple of weeks ago, the late conservative activist Andrew Breitbart participated in a Students Talk Back panel, presented by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
This is not an issue that can be fixed by hiring more conservative professors and creating more courses that reflect conservative principles — nor should it be. To attempt to change people’s minds about a certain political ideology through education would be wrong, regardless of what that ideology is.
What is essential is the building of respect for differing views at the student level. Students with more popular political leanings must treat conservatives as their intellectual equals. Bipartisan events such as those the Unruh Institute puts on foster respectful debate and could be a valuable tool for increasing the conservative presence on campus.
None of this is to say that anyone must go out of their way to include the conservative viewpoint in every conversation. What is important is that all students feel welcome to speak their mind without being dismissed. Only then will USC reach its full potential as a university with a politically engaged student body, breaking from a long history of relative political apathy and inaction.

Sarah, the problem with your argument is that many of today’s socially conservative views blatantly attack other people based on their religion, sexual orientation, even race. If a campus allows professors or speakers to make a gay student feel less than human simply because it is keeping with today’s social conservative trends, that does NOT promote a safe campus for all.

With the start of Women’s History Month and with Paris Fashion Week amongst us, what better time to look into the work of a game-changer and mover-and-shaker of the times: fashion photographer Christie Zinner.
Around 1943, when the world’s first fashion-week took place in Paris as an intended distraction from World War II, fashion photographer Christie Zinner produced portraits of American women living alone in San Francisco while their men served the military across the seas during the wake of World War II; a collection that contributes to American women and fashion history.
USC Libraries Special Collection hones a handful of the fashion photographers’ work, which was donated in 1998 by the artist herself.
The Frank and Betty Horton Rare Book Room Reserves in the USC Doheny Library homes her plenty historical contribution and recognizes the German-born still-film photographers’ work of all but thirty-years.
After World War II, having worked in San Francisco first as a model then a photographer, Zinner moved to open and run her own photography studio in Southern California where she made her mark and marked her territory having worked with Hollywood’s beloved Grace Kelly, Fred Astaire and Elizabeth Taylor among others and marrying Los Angeles prized film editor Peter Zinner.
The university library holds fine points of her work during the years 1940-1960; clips from The Sports Illustrated, Los Angeles Magazine and Seventeen and oeuvre throughout her career like photographs, proof sheets and negatives.
USC also show-cases “actress” a Zinner original bronze piece made in the 1970’s when drawing and sculpture took place of her camera.
Learn more about Zinner’s work here.

Although the Pac-12 tournament begins in exactly one week, the USC women’s basketball team have to tackle one final road trip before they can begin their looming postseason journey.
USC (16-11, 10-6) will carry four straight wins into Seattle and take on Washington (15-11, 7-9) at 7 p.m. Thursday in the first contest of a two-game road trip.
After their recent 59-53 victory over Arizona State (18-10, 9-8) on USC’s Senior Day, the Women of Troy maintained their third-place standing in the Pac-12 with a one-and-a-half-game cushion over the Sun Devils.
Oregon State (18-9, 9-7) and UCLA (14-13, 9-7) are still hot on USC’s heels, however, trailing by only one game in conference standings. No. 2 Stanford (26-1, 17-0) and California (22-7, 13-4) have already secured first and second place, respectively.
The top four conference teams receive a bye in the first round, and USC can lock their position at third place with wins over Washington and Washington State in their concluding road trip.
“We know these next two games will be very difficult games,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “We have to come out and continue this streak we’re on, and see if we can finish out the season with six straight wins.”
The last time USC squared off against Washington, the Huskies pulled away 67-61 at the Galen Center on Feb. 5. The Women of Troy were led by 19 points from senior guard Ashley Corral and a double-double from sophomore forward Cassie Harberts.
It was the Huskies’ freshman guard Jazmine Davis, however, who controlled the court by leading a trio of Washington women in double-digits with a game-high 26 points.
“We’re going to lock [Davis] up,” senior guard Briana Gilbreath said. “She got some really good shots down here, and she really went off on us, so if we can contain her and stick to our defensive schemes, we’ll be OK.”
With a combined 44.1 points per game from top scorers Corral, Gilbreath, Harberts and junior forward Christina Marinacci, the Women of Troy are poised to snap the Huskies’ two-game winning streak.
In the contest against the Sun Devils, Marinacci led the Women of Troy with 12 points and 10 rebounds. USC has had five different leading scorers in each of their last five games.
Despite USC’s offensive potential, Gilbreath contends that defense will be the key to the team’s victory.
“If we can play defense and get stops, and we can run in transition, the more better for us,” Gilbreath said.
With the postseason just around the corner, the Women of Troy look to enter this year’s Pac-12 tournament with six straight wins and push for a conference title after falling to Arizona 61-72 in the second round of last year’s Pac-10 competition.
“We’re in a good position, but the road is still tough ahead,” Cooper said. “When the Pac-12 tournament starts, we’ll be ready for that. I’m excited about it, and I’m looking forward to it.”

Coming off of a rousing 4-3 win against California last weekend, the now-No. 2 USC women’s tennis team host top-ranked UCLA in an early-season showdown of the Pac-12’s two best teams this Thursday, with the University of San Diego to follow on Saturday.
Last Saturday USC (9-1) once again fell behind early, losing a hotly contested doubles round to the Bears. As they’ve demonstrated so far this season, however, the Women of Troy showed their resolution in the face of defeat to come storming back to win four singles matches, earning an impressive Pac-12 victory.
USC capitalized on a depleted Cal squad that was without its top player, No. 3 Jana Juricova, and that lost Tayler Davis after just one set (6-0) into her match with junior Danielle Lao on court two.
Despite the absence of two top players, the Bears fought tough against coach Richard Gallien’s group, including a superb performance by Juricova’s fill-in, No. 23 Zsofi Susanyi, who took down freshman Zoë Scandalis in a three-set tiebreaker in first singles.
This weekend, the Women of Troy have their eyes set on taking down a UCLA team that had previously knocked them out of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Indoor Semifinals in Virginia earlier this month. The Bruins would go on to claim the tournament championship and, from there, that victory vaulted them into the country’s No. 1 spot.
Sitting at a perfect 11-0 on the season, UCLA is lead by No. 5 freshman Robin Anderson and has five players ranked among the nation’s top 100 players, not to mention two girls just outside that with No. 104 McCall Jones and No. 107 Skylar Morton.
On the doubles’ side, the Bruins are anchored by two top-15 duos with No. 14 Anderson/Morton and No. 15 Dolehide/Montez, who are set to take on the likes of the No. 3 pairing of sophomore Kaitlyn Christian and freshman Sabrina Santamaria along with Lao/Ramos.
Matching up against the Bruins’ strong singles squad will be a tough task for the Women of Troy and it will likely depend upon the backend of their team if USC has any hope to end their five-game skid against UCLA.
Zoë Scandalis, who has faced the opponents’ top competition throughout the year, will have to recover from a tough loss last week, but she has shown a propensity to do just that in her short USC career.
Despite the injury from Cal’s Davis last Saturday, No. 17 Lao continues to show she’s in top form and will be looked upon to set the tone for USC.
Along with Scandalis, the other two freshman, Gabriella DeSimone and Santamaria, will be counted on to once again lead the Women of Troy, especially DeSimone, who has shown great poise under pressure with three game-deciding victories in as many weeks.
Christian shook off some rust early on in her match against Cal to win 10 of the last 11 sets, defeating Annie Goransson 6-3, 6-1. Despite sitting in the fourth slot, Christian is an important cog as she always competes and provides energy and grit for the Women of Troy.

No one can argue that the Beatles are one of the most successful and influential bands of modern time. Their music has inspired countless artists and only time will tell how long their presence will live on. The fact that the childhood homes of Paul McCartney and John Lennon now have a place in history too is no surprise.
The English Heritage Foundation recently decided to preserve McCartney’s house on Forthlin Road where he lived for nine years in his youth as well as the 1930s duplex house nearby where Lennon lived with his aunt and uncle. The houses have been listed as Grade II buildings and this listing celebrate the historical association and cultural significance of the Beatles to the UK as opposed to the typical architectural aesthetic. Now the homes cannot be demolished and they cannot be altered unless there is permission from local authorities. As many would guess, both houses are in Liverpool.
The homes of McCartney and Lennon were scenes of rehearsal, creative collaboration, production and the very formation of the Beatles in the artists’ early days. The pair wrote “Please Please Me,” the band’s first hit, in Lennon’s house and they composed possibly 100 songs in McCartney’s home, which had an enclosed porch to ensure that McCartney’s aunt Mimi wouldn’t be disturbed by the band’s practicing.
However, the homes of George Harrison and Ringo Starr were not preserved by the English Heritage Foundation, not as a slight, but because they were not historically significant to the band.
Now that McCarthy and Lennon’s houses are preserved, they can be added to list of destinations for Beatle-fan pilgrimages. The homes will be open to visitors during certain parts of the year and both will certainly become popular places for both avid Beatle-fans and tourists alike.
 
….No one can argue that the Beatles are one of the most successful and influential bands of modern time. 
Not one of. but the MOST.
….which had an enclosed porch to ensure that McCartney’s aunt Mimi wouldn’t be disturbed by the band’s practicing.
Mimi was John’s aunt.
…..Now that McCarthy and Lennon’s houses are preserved, they can be added to list of destinations for Beatle-fan pilgrimages. 
It’s McCartNEY.  
These homes already been the destination of fan pilgrimages since the 1990’s as  ‘National Trust’ properties.

Kid Cudi and Dot da Genius’ debut as the band WZRD released their self-titled album earlier this week. The album features a track cover of Nirvana’s rendition of the Lead Belly original “Where did you sleep last night.”
Nirvana is known as the first and only band to have covered the song in homage to blues folk singer Lead Belly. Until recently, that is.
The staggering cover by Nirvana with its resonating lyrical drone by the ever-so charming vocals of lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain will eternally outstand any reworked copy.
When Nirvana covered the song live in New York as seen on MTV Unplugged’93, the trio indefinitely placed to taste the hit song for generations to come.
Cudi says the decision to (re)-cover the song came naturally while enduring a writers block in the course of making the new record, when he turned to personal music inspirations like Nirvana among other rock legends.
The WZRT collaboration roughed up the edges by adding a consistent kick drum and percussion hits that create a theatric-like flair, not to mention the emotion-filled croon and dramatic-pace vocals of which a Kid Cudi original could not be complete without.
Thanks to the artists’ implicit knowledge of the instrumental talent of Cobain and Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, Cudi opts out from playing the guitar riffs on the track.
Nonetheless, the song takes a third trip down rock ‘n’ roll lane with an unusual twist and execution by Cudi that is bound to take his fans by surprise and knock the doors of long-lasting classic rock addicts.
The duo first collaborated with one another back in 2008. You may remember the Grammy-nominated single “Day ‘n’ Nite.”
Check out WZRT as they spell out track by track the making of their new album to Complex Magazine, beginning with the Lead Belly cover.
