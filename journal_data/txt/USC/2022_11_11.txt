The new USC women’s basketball team begins their season this week with two games at Galen Center Tuesday and Saturday. The season’s beginning comes after an offseason of immense turnover for the Trojans. Only five players from last season’s roster remain on the current team.  The Trojans will have to adjust to the departure of last year’s leading scorer sophomore forward Jordyn Jenkins, who led the team with 14.8 points average per game last season. 
Fortunately, the returners from last year’s squad have the potential to elevate their scoring output and make up for the absence of Jenkins. Sophomore guard /forward Rayah Marshall is one of the Trojans’ key returners. Marshall displayed impressive potential on both ends of the floor last season, her first at USC. She was third on the team in points per game with 11.2, and led the team with 7.7 rebounds per game. 
On the defensive end, Marshall was even more of a force. She was the top freshman in the nation with 2.54 blocks per game, and recorded 1.3 steals per game. All in all, her two-way play earned her a spot on the Pac-12 All-Freshman team. But, Marshall is nowhere near satisfied with how last year went after the Trojans finished tenth in the Pac-12 standings. 
The Trojans were ranked to finish in a similar spot this season (ninth) in both the preseason coaches poll and Pac-12 media poll, and Marshall is intent on proving that wrong. 
“Our preseason ranking is ninth, so that should motivate us to want to go in and just dominate,” Marshall said. 
Another returner who will likely play a vital role on the Trojans is senior guard Alyson Miura. Miura led the Trojans with 38 three-pointers made last season. She hopes to continue to factor in as an elite scoring option on the perimeter this season, but also elevate her game to help the Trojans in lots of other ways. 
“Whatever they need from me this year, that’s what I’m hoping to do, be a great teammate and help us win however we can,” Miura said. 
In addition to the few key returners, the Trojans will rely heavily on talent from the transfer portal to win games this season. The Trojans brought in eight transfers, including four graduate transfers. The abundance of experience has been of great service to the Trojans. 
“We definitely have a lot of experience, and with that comes knowledge and wisdom of the game,” Miura said. 
One transfer who has already proven to be a key addition is graduate forward Kadi Sissoko, who put on a show in the Trojans’ preseason matchup against Cal State Los Angeles with a 25 point, 10 rebound and a double-double. Her 25 points led the team and showed her potential to be an elite scorer this season. In addition to her on-court excellence, the Trojans hope that Sissoko can have an impact on the team as a mentor as well. Particularly, the Trojans are hoping she can serve as a mentor to Marshall as the young, skilled forward continues to learn and grow. 
“I think that Kadi has been a huge help for [Rayah]. That’s really been a great thing for her to be able to learn from Kadi,” Miura said.
Sissoko has had a massive impact on Marshall already. 
“Kadi is just a great player to even watch…when you look at her, you’re motivated like, I wanna do the same thing, every aspect of her game, that’s who I want to look like,” Marshall said.   
Graduate guard Destiny Littleton is another transfer who stands to have a massive impact on the Trojans’ culture beyond just what she brings on the court. Littleton won a national championship last season at South Carolina. Her championship experience will help guide the Trojans to winning ways as they rebound from a tough season and learn how to win as a unit. 
“On the court, probably the one we really lean on is Destiny Littleton…she is the only one who understands what it takes to win a national championship,” said new Associate Head Coach Beth Burns. 
Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb further emphasized the importance of winning experience by hiring Burns as the new associate head coach this offseason. Burns has a multitude of experience leading schools like University of Louisville to tournament runs as an assistant, and is the winningest head coach in San Diego State women’s basketball history. 
Burns focuses mainly on defense and discipline, which is very different to Gottlieb’s emphasis on offense and maintaining personal relationships with the players.
“I’m just trying to help her with details and structure and how to function day to day, so our culture going forward is a successful and winning one,” Burns said. 
Fortunately, the two are on the same page about how to take their team to the top and their styles should serve to complement one another well as they aim to build a well-rounded team. 
“When you come in new and you have people from so many different colleges…[some details] sound like pedestrian things but when you’re building a team [they’re] not. You have to have like minded people,” Burns said. 
With so much turnover, it’s almost ironic that the Trojans are projected to finish in almost the exact same spot as they finished last season. With such a different team full of winning potential, the Trojans have an opportunity to surprise a lot of people if their new unit works as well as Gottlieb and Burns hope it does. 
Marshall is confident the team will turn it around, and doesn’t want students to miss the games at Galen Center this season. 
“We’re looking forward to giving them a show,” Marshall said. 
The Trojans will hope to pick up some wins and build momentum to start the season as they face off against Idaho State University at 7 p.m. Saturday night.

Robert Shrum, the director of the Center for the Political Future, said that the Democratic party had the most successful midterm elections for the party of an incumbent president within the last 20 years. Data election archives show an average loss of 28 seats for the incumbent party, compared to the loss of only 12 Democratic seats so far in this election. 
As votes of citizens throughout the country continue to be counted, control of the House of Representatives and the Senate remains in sight for both parties. Republicans have picked up 12 seats in the House, with 209 seats confirmed; however, Democrats have also made four pickups, currently claiming 192 seats. The Senate race is even closer, with 48 Democratic seats, 49 Republican seats and two Independent seats that will caucus with the Democrats. 
Despite the strides that the Democratic party has made, there were also substantial losses. In particular, many USC students were surprised by the loss of Beto O’Rourke in the race for Governor of Texas. 
“Hearing the news that [Greg] Abbott actually is elected for another term, shocked me, especially after what happened at the elementary school,” said Emily Sabinas, a junior majoring in music industry. “And not only that, but how his plan was during that winter where a lot of Texas residents had no water, no power, nothing.” 
Contrarily, Christian Grose, a professor of political science and public policy, was most surprised by certain democratic wins. 
“There’s a house race in New Mexico and a House race in Colorado that I think are particularly surprising,” Grose said, referring to the likely loss of GOP incumbents Gabe Vasquez and Lauren Boebert.  
Outside of the mixed reactions of USC community members, many election analysts were predicting a “red wave,” with the GOP taking a strong majority in the House and a narrower one in the Senate. Yet, both branches of Congress are yet to be called along partisan lines. 
USC experts have many different explanations for this discrepancy, primarily based on reproductive rights,  with just as many voters citing reproductive rights as their top voting issue as inflation, according to reporting by Reuters. 
“First of all, the conventional wisdom, which held that reproductive rights was fading as an issue, turns out to be wrong,” Shrum said. 
Grose agreed, but said he believes there are other factors being overlooked. He believes that the Democrats were given an advantage due to national redistricting that took place in 2022 that made many elections more fair along partisan lines.
“There’s more independent redistricting commissions drawing lines, like has been done in California historically,” Grose said. “That was done in Colorado, that was done in Michigan, and it just made a lot more elections competitive for the U.S. House than had happened in the past.” 
Yet, while many election analysts are focused on the bigger congressional outcomes, USC students are more focused on the impacts of local elections. 
Sophia Bossoughi, a senior majoring in public relations, was most interested in the outcomes of the Los Angeles mayoral race. Although Rick Caruso is currently in the lead with 50.2% of the vote, the race is yet to be called, with only 58% of the vote in, according to L.A. Times reporting.  
“I really do not believe that Rick Caruso is the right person for the job in L.A., and I just was really invested in making sure that I was aware enough to make other people aware of that information,” Bossoughi said. 
Sabinas was also pleased by the results of California elections, particularly the passing of Proposition 1, which enshrined abortion as a right in California’s constitution, and was the “most important election” for her. 
Across campus, community members have had a variety of reactions to the outcomes of the midterm elections. However, they are also waiting to see what is to come, with three key Senate races in Georgia, Arizona and Nevada and various Southern California House districts yet to be called. 
“I mean, it does appear Republicans will have a narrow majority, but there’s a lot of districts still being counted in California over the next two weeks,” Grose said. “We have to kind of wait and see how some of the final races play out.”

The Department of Public Safety has narrowed down its roster of candidates for the role of Assistant Vice President/Chief of Public Safety to a set of semi-finalists, with an update on the search soon-coming, said Associate Senior Vice President of Safety and Risk Assurance Dr. Errol Southers in an interview with the Daily Trojan Thursday. 
The search yielded six semi-finalists — whose names have not been disclosed — out of a candidate pool of more than 30.
Following former DPS Chief John Thomas’ retirement in January, the University conducted a full search process in the spring, after which two finalists were presented in April. Southers told the Daily Trojan in August that the search had been extended and the title changed to include the Assistant VP label to attract a broader range of candidates. 
“It did bring on a whole new applicant pool, and I believe all of them were AVPs at their current institution,” Southers said. 
In contrast to last semester’s search, DPS will not hold a town hall with the final two candidates, although in August, Southers said DPS had plans to hold such an event. The single final candidate will instead address community members in a similar format after they assume their new role, Southers said Thursday. 
In a Universitywide statement Thursday, Southers detailed progress updates on recommendations from the Community Advisory Board, which President Carol Folt established in 2020 to conduct a “thorough examination of USC’s safety practices.” The board’s first report, published in July 2021, announced 45 recommendations — pillared by accountability, alternatives to armed response, community care and transparency — and the launch of “ONE USC Safety Vision,” which “expresses a holistic view of safety.” The vision, the email read, has since been approved by senior leadership. 
As per recommendation three of the CAB report, the email included a public policy statement on racial profiling that reaffirmed the University’s stance against the influence of implicit bias in police and community response. 
“Bias-based policing is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at USC,” the statement read. “Moreover, all members of our community are accountable for helping ensure that complaints to, and other interactions with, DPS are not infected by [implicit] bias.”
All DPS officers, Southers said, have been trained in trauma-informed care. Fire Safety and Emergency Planning, and Environmental Health and Safety staff members will be similarly trained. The University is also implementing updated screening methods for new DPS officers to reduce the potential for instances of racial profiling. 
To address recommendation 17 of the report, which highlights the need for an expert mental health response to wellness-related DPS calls, DPS launched the pilot Mental Health Assistance and Response Team in early September. Through the program, a licensed mental health professional from USC Student Health accompanies DPS officers when responding to a mental health emergency. 
In “appropriate cases,” a classification that Southers said is determined by the dispatcher based on information about safety concerns, the mental health professional leads the response and is the first to speak with the student. 
MHART currency operates between noon and 8:30 p.m., with on-call mental health clinicians available outside of these hours to provide support during mental health emergencies. On-call professionals do not always travel to respond with the DPS officers outside of the operating hours, Southers said. 
Community response to the pilot program has not yet been analyzed, he said, and the University Clinical Services Board is currently evaluating the program’s successes and areas for improvement. 
“We’re gathering data on the number of responses we’ve had,” Southers said. “We’re also looking at metrics to be able to determine how effective this program is going to be.”
A charter for the DPS Advisory Board, an independent oversight body, has been drafted and approved, with further details coming soon. The body will be composed of students, faculty, staff and community stakeholders. Body bylaws, which have yet to be released, will outline the board members’ term limits and the proportion of stakeholders on the board.
Southers also announced the departure of Ange-Marie Hancock Alfaro, with whom he worked on the CAB and the Co-Design Public Safety Process. Hancock Alfaro accepted an opportunity to return home and work at Ohio State University. The University has not yet planned a process by which to appoint her replacement. 
“She leaves huge shoes to fill,” Southers said. “I loved working with her and she’s just a very, very valuable asset to USC.”

Sydney Kamlager won the election for the U.S. Representative of California’s 37th congressional district, which includes the area surrounding USC. The Los Angeles Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune and the New York Times called the race around noon Thursday — 40 hours after the polls in California had closed on Election Day. Kamlager defeated fellow Democrat Jan Perry in a “top two” general election by winning approximately 61.4% of the district vote, though at time of publication, only 44% of votes had been tallied. 
Kamlager, a USC alumna and member of California’s State Senate who has represented its 30th district since March 2021. Before her term in the State Senate — from 2018 to 2021 — she was a member of the State Assembly and represented its 54th district after winning a special election for the seat. In both positions, Kamlager served on many committees, including the Rules and Public Safety Committees in the State Assembly and the Appropriations and Human Services Committees in the State Senate. 
In this election, Kamlager was endorsed by U.S. Rep. Karen Bass (a Los Angeles mayoral candidate who currently holds the 37th district house seat), recently re-elected Senator Alex Padilla, Rep. Adam Schiff and the California Democratic Party.
Ariela Moel, a freshman majoring in legal studies, voted in the 37th district this election and was pleased with the results. 
“I’m so excited to see that the person I voted for won,” she said. 
Cristian Cardona, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and economics, did not vote for Kamlager. He said that while he was a little disappointed, he was not devastated over Perry’s loss. 
“I don’t feel too horrible about the outcome because I know Kamlager is also a pretty solid candidate,” he said. “Can’t really complain.”
Kamlager’s office did not respond to the Daily Trojan’s request for comment. Her Twitter account posted in celebration Thursday, referencing the Associated Press calling the race. 
“This just popped up on my feed…” the account wrote. “Looks like the Associated Press has called the race for CA’s 37th Congressional District. We have a [check mark emoji], y’all… and are headed to Congress!”

For many of my Latinx youngsters who have grown up in Southern California, our contact with Spanish comes in a variety of ways. We might speak it with our parents or grandparents from a young age. Others might learn in high school — the only time language acquisition is truly emphasized. But in an English-focused and assimilationist childhood, many often lose critical and scholarly engagement with Spanish at a young age when learning a second language is much easier than it is later in life. Reflecting on my own experiences, bilingual education isn’t only just a way for the Latinx community to communicate with one another, but it is also a means of cultural preservation. 
Over the summer, I worked as Literacy Leader for WISE Readers to Leaders, a non-profit organization that aims to maintain summer literacy proficiency among various elementary schools across Los Angeles. It was my first experience teaching 12 third grade students and teaching in general. While the goal of the program was to practice reading in English, I reached an unexpected obstacle: a few of my students could only speak Spanish. 
One of the students’ names was Santiago. He had recently moved to the United States from Mexico, and thankfully, as the only teacher who spoke Spanish, I was able to work with him on his English. I wondered how many had dismissed his advanced proficiency in Spanish for his poor English skills. Like many who immigrated from Mexico, he learned English gradually. But, his academic Spanish skills will remain stagnant unless a bilingual education program is instituted. 
In 1998, California voters passed Proposition 227, a law known as the “English in Public Schools” Initiative, which greatly reduced the number of bilingual education programs by requiring public schools to teach students who had a below basic understanding of English in special classes that taught purely in English. But in 2016, voters repealed the restrictions of Prop 227 through the California Non-English Languages Allowed in Public Education Act, allowing schools to freely teach classes using a bilingual approach.
For students like Santiago, who are proficient in one language and learning another, dual language immersion programs are especially effective. Dual language programs are intended for native speakers of English and for native speakers of Spanish, with the goal of cross-cultural proficiency and understanding. Here both languages are prioritized and grow together.
Many of my students were children of Mexican, Guatemalan, Salvadoran and Nicaraguan immigrants. Many of them lit up like lightbulbs any time their heritage and language were brought up in the classroom. One girl, Luna, loved sharing her culture: “Did you know the Quetzal is the national bird of Guatemala? Have you ever played Lotería? Mr. Andrew, are you Mexican?” 
Speaking to them in Spanish was a special cultural connection we created regardless of their skillset in Spanish or English. Their minds were rich with the power of the two languages since — outside of the summer program — Spanish was often overlooked in their education. 
Growing up in Southern California, I have met a range of Latinx people with a range of Spanish-speaking abilities and cultural ties. For my friends who have considered themselves “no sabo kids,” many have expressed a desire to be closer to their culture and Spanish language. 
“No sabo” is a telling phrase that most children of Latinx immigrants avoid so they can keep their Spanish-speaking credibility. For those unaware, “no sabo” is a misconjugation of the Spanish translation of “I don’t know.” It’s an innocuous mistake, yet saying this phrase automatically attracts first light-hearted ridicule then full-blown scrutiny. On TikTok especially, the term “no sabo kids” has become a deceptive mode of categorizing monolingual Latinx teens in the U.S. as “uncultured.” 
For many, being bilingual is a source of pride, as bearing your culture is something to be celebrated especially within underrepresented communities. However, the term “no sabo kid” has created an unnecessary bilingual barrier for embracing one’s Latinx identity when, in reality, there is no right way to be Latinx. 
Being monolingual shouldn’t be a source of shame in the same way that accessibility to dual-language immersion programs shouldn’t be limited, as they can be a powerful tool of cultural enlightenment. Considering the growing population of bilingual Californians, dual-language immersion programs are necessary. And thankfully, they are coming. 
The California Department of Education has proposed that half of all K-12 will have participated in some sort of bilingual program by 2030. By 2040, they aim for three out of four students to be proficient in two or more languages, earning a State Seal of Biliteracy. 
We are long past the traditional English-only schooling system. For my friends who feel disconnected from their culture, dual-language immersion programs can be one factor that may rekindle their connection to their language and heritage.

When I first committed to USC, making a plan to vote was the last thing on my mind. Amid a whirlwind of family celebrations, graduation parties and congratulations cards, the word “voting” never entered my train of thought. Even during the process of moving from Wisconsin to California, as I sorted out the logistics of car insurance and healthcare, I never considered the intricacies of voting as an out-of-state student until the absentee ballot that I requested never came in the mail.
As an institution of higher education, USC must make a more genuine effort to encourage and educate students about voting. Not only would this effort promote hands-on learning through civic engagement, but it would also help empower students to make their voices heard during election season. As a university, part of USC’s role is to teach students skills and knowledge that will empower them to pursue their academic and professional goals in the future  — voting falls into this category.
According to the National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement, USC had a voter turnout of 45.4% in 2018. This number reflects the number of eligible voters at USC who voted in the 2018 midterm elections. While this number is above the national average of 39.1% for all institutions, there is still room for improvement. 
Right now, USC offers information on voter registration through the USC Communities website. This website includes a link that takes users to voter registration paperwork and a list of important deadlines for California residents to follow as a reference. The website also includes an in-person poll locator, but this feature also only applies to local California residents. 
Having a website is the bare minimum. While the information provided on this webpage is accessible and accurate — making it extremely helpful for first-time voters in the Southern California area — it’s missing information for USC’s large out-of-state population. Almost half of USC’s student population is from out of state, and navigating the often purposefully tricky voter registration websites of one’s state is not always an easy task for newly independent teenagers. In order to help bridge the voting accessibility gap within its population, USC should expand the information it provides by offering more links and in-person resources for out-of-state students. 
Every state has a different voting process, and they don’t all follow the same procedures as California. This variance can make it challenging for students unfamiliar with voting to acquire an absentee ballot through sole reliance on the information that USC currently provides. An increase in voting education on and around campus can help alleviate some of the hurdles that prevent students from voting, and it is a plausible and easy solution that USC can implement. Informational stands in prominent campus locations or online information sessions could greatly impact student awareness and education by providing opportunities to interact with knowledgeable individuals. These kinds of initiatives would get students involved and make them aware of the fact that it is still possible to vote outside of their state.
It is also important to consider that USC hosts students from a wide variety of economic backgrounds. This economic gap often manifests itself in the form of wealth inequality, but it can also manifest through other avenues, with voting knowledge and accessibility being one. By prioritizing more on-campus voting initiatives and improved online information, USC could potentially reach students who may not have been heavily exposed to the voting process during high school.
Pushing students to vote would act as an introduction to independence and accountability while away from home. After all, universities are hubs of education and learning, so it only makes sense to put effort into expanding that learning outside of the classroom setting and into real-life situations. 
This is not to say that USC must hold its students’ hands throughout their time in school and focus its resources solely on teaching “adult responsibilities.” University is an important time for personal growth and self-accountability, but it’s unfair to assume that all students have the resources to navigate life away from home on their own. Voting is unnecessarily difficult enough as is, and if USC and other universities around the country don’t take action, these inequalities will only continue to grow.

After a close call against the California Golden Bears last week, USC will look to extend their two-game win streak against Colorado this Friday.
USC had a rough outing against Cal, giving up 21 points in the fourth quarter, which brought the Golden Bears within one possession before the final whistle. It marked the third Pac-12 matchup that the Trojans won by only 8 points or less.
“We stunk offensively in the first half and we stunk defensively in the second half,” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley in a press session after Tuesday’s practice.
A contest against a team that USA Today ranked as the worst in college football can be easy to write off, especially with matchups against UCLA and Notre Dame looming in the next two weeks. However, Riley said that he and the team have done their best to stay focused despite the short week.
“We’re doing everything in 24 hours less,” Riley said. “You gotta pack it in, you gotta prepare. It’s an absolute race the entire week.”
One part of that race is the return of the Trojans’ duo of injured star receivers, junior Jordan Addison and sophomore Mario Williams, who have both been out since USC’s loss to Utah Oct. 15. Riley said Addison is set to play, while Mario Williams’ return is questionable.
USC has also been missing a duo of impactful defensive players in linebackers senior Ralen Goforth and sophomore Eric Gentry. Riley has stated Goforth will return against the Buffs, but Gentry remains a game-time decision.
“They’ve actually looked like they haven’t missed a day,” said sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams. “It’s awesome to get them back, just adds a few more weapons to the offense again.”
Caleb Williams had another banner day against Cal, throwing for 360 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Trojans’ passing attack was firing on all cylinders, led by Caleb Williams and sophomore receiver Michael Jackson III. Jackson III hauled in 5 passes for 115 yards and 2 touchdowns Saturday, both career highs.
“Something about [Jackson III] is that he always works,” Caleb Williams said. “He hated not being on the field, and you could see it.”
Jackson III has been dealing with a litany of injuries since last winter, pulling his hamstring an estimated six times. He made his debut this year against Utah but had not amassed more than 20 yards in one game before playing Cal.
“He had a couple of practices in the spring where he did a few things, especially aggressively running through the ball and catching the ball where you’re like, ‘OK, there’s something there,’” Riley said. “It’s been good to see that after missing all that time, that mentally, he stayed into it.”
One of Jackson III’s touchdowns came on a 59-yard screen pass from Caleb Williams, an aspect of the Trojans’ passing game that has been consistently successful in the past few weeks. Against an inexperienced Colorado secondary, such plays may continue to find the end zone.
“The screen game makes a quarterback’s job so much easier if you can run the ball as efficiently as we have,” Caleb Williams said. “It allows for some trick plays…possible screens, screen and go’s and also the play action game.”
Last spring, USC added two former Buffs to their roster through the transfer portal who will face their former team for the first time Friday. Junior receiver Brenden Rice, the sure-handed son of NFL hall-of-fame wideout Jerry Rice, has caught 23 passes for 266 yards and a touchdown so far for the Trojans. 
Meanwhile, redshirt senior Mekhi Blackmon has racked up 27 tackles, 2 interceptions and 9 pass breakups during his time at USC. Blackmon’s departure from Colorado was certainly felt by the Buffs’ secondary, which is now composed entirely of freshman starters.
Southern California (8-1, 6-1) takes on Colorado (1-8, 1-5) Friday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m.

USC Women’s Soccer will begin their campaign for a third NCAA Women’s College Cup title against UC Irvine Saturday at Soni McAlister Field. 
The Trojans enter the tournament as a 4-seed, having defeated the No. 1 ranked UCLA Bruins in their final regular season match. USC won all four of their matches against ranked opponents but did not crack into the tier of 3-seeds that includes the Pac-12 Champion Stanford Cardinals. The selection committee awarded a 1-seed position to UCLA. 
The Anteaters qualified for the tournament with an automatic bid as the Big West Conference Champions, winning their conference tournament as only the sixth-best team by regular season record. They now own a 10-6-6 record, including non-conference and conference tournament play.
Alukonis noted that, with a full week without a match, the Trojans have had more time to prepare for this first postseason match. 
“We had a little more time usually [than for] most games … a day or two where we [could] focus on the opponent a bit more than sometimes with quick turnarounds,” she said.
USC hosted the Anteaters in September, beating them 3-2. In that early-season match, USC sprinted out to a 3-0 lead within 25 minutes, then conceded two second half goals from imprecise defending when the match was already won. Junior midfielder Zoe Burns had a player-of-the-match-worthy performance with a goal and an assist. USC dominated down the right side of the pitch — both of their first two goals came from smart combination play on that flank. Sophomore forward Simone Jackson also missed a penalty in the second half that would’ve put USC up 4-1.
Head Coach Jane Alukonis found Irvine to be a “hard-working team that didn’t give up” in that first match. 
“We went up 3-0 and then they came back, changed tactics and mentality … credit to them for that because that’s hard to do,” she said.
Despite the victory, Alukonis expects a challenge the second time around. “We know that they’re always going to just make the game tough, whether that’s from how they press or their possession on the ball.”
USC cannot afford to take Irvine lightly. The Anteaters have demonstrated a capacity to generate offense all season and have hit somewhat of a hot streak going into the national championship. They’ve averaged 14 shots per game this season, with at least 40% of those being on goal. 
In the Big West conference tournament, Irvine scored six goals and conceded none across three matches, winning the final 3-0 against Long Beach State. Irvine midfielder Amber Huff has found particularly good form, with seven assists in her last four matches. All three of Irvine’s goals in the final came in the first half, and two were off of corner kicks, which Huff took. 
Alukonis was quick to acknowledge Irvine’s proficiency with set pieces. 
“Irvine has scored many of their goals recently on set pieces. They have a long throw-in, and have done well on some corners in their conference tournament,” she said. “A key for us is negating those as much as possible and then hoping to continue executing on ours in a positive way.”
Keeping possession of the ball is a key part of the Trojans’ game plan to exploit Irvine’s weaknesses and clinch the win Saturday. 
“We’ve noticed that [for] opponents that dominate the possession against Irvine, typically the game favors them,” Alukonis said. “I know that sounds kind of obvious in the game of soccer, but it’s not always the case.”
Above all, she hopes to continue their positive momentum after a strong result against UCLA. 
“I was super pleased with the work rate of the players [against] UCLA … [on] both sides of the ball, we felt like every player just left everything out there,” she said. “So that’s something we’re encouraging players to bring no matter what game it is.”
USC has won the Women’s College Cup twice before, once in 2007, when Assistant Coach Amy Rodriguez was a key member of the team, and again in 2016. USC did not win the Pac-12 in either season they won the national championship. Could the same happen again this year? If so, it has to start with a win in front of a home crowd Saturday.

It’s the middle of a game in the 2021 season, and then-Oregon running back Travis Dye needs a break. 
When his teammate C.J. Verdell was ruled out for the season in early October, Dye stepped in as the lead back and dominated the share of carries. A run there, a block here and a long catch en route to eye-popping numbers — 1,271 rushing and 402 receiving yards for 18 total touchdowns. 
Tonight, he’ll run for a career-high 211 yards plus one touchdown as the Ducks hold on against Washington, their bitter rivals.
After yet another drive, then-Oregon running backs coach Jim Mastro decides it’s time for Dye to sit. He starts the series with the running back on the sideline only to see a familiar sight once he turns around. 
Eyes glaring, eyebrows scrunched, helmet on his fluffy hair, Dye’s mustache completes a face Mastro sees as often as his own.
‘He’d give me the death stare, like ‘What are you doing?’” Mastro said. “He did not want to come out of the game.”
Moments later Dye is in, bouncing off tackles, catching passes bare-handed and steamrolling into linebackers hard enough to leave a dent in his shoulder pads. It didn’t take much convincing for Mastro to insert Dye back into the game, especially with a skill set that is “second to none.” 
Listed at 5-foot-10, the redshirt senior running back is a unique blend of competitiveness and otherworldly skill. His hard, rugged running style is reminiscent of an old-time running back. He’s evolved into USC’s trusted running back, a workhorse that won’t stop. 
All while wearing no gloves. 
“Travis is not a drip guy,” said Norco High School football coach Chuck Chastain. “He didn’t wear gloves in high school. He didn’t wear all those bands and stuff in high school. You just give him the ball and let ‘em go to work.” 
That’s all Dye wants to do: go to work. 
Much of Dye’s nature can be attributed to his very competitive family, which Chastain said he brought to the practice field at Norco High School. Travis’ brother, Troy, was a senior in high school when Travis was a sophomore on the team. Neither of them wanted to lose to the other in practice.
After a quiet freshman year, Dye broke out his sophomore season. Beginning the year rotating with two seniors, his production forced Chastain to make a move. In the fourth week of the season, Dye was named the starter. He never looked back. 
He notched 1,000 total yards his sophomore year, then over 2,000 in each of his last two. As a senior, he was the All-CIF Division 2 and Big VIII League Offensive Player of the Year after running for 2,383 yards for 34 touchdowns.
Chastain had Dye do practically everything on the field, from receiving direct snaps to playing safety and corner.
“In big-time games, he would go play defensive back and guard their best player or receiver,” he said. 
Dye would get the job done, solidifying himself as a player Chastain believed could “play any position on the field.” 
But, after four years at Norco, Dye’s offers to play collegiate football were dry. He was listed as a 3-star recruit with very little interest across the board. His schools included Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee and, of course, Oregon. UCLA and USC did not recruit Dye. 
Mastro, then at Washington State, pointed to the fact that Dye’s brother was at Oregon then, which left recruiters assuming he’d follow suit. Chastain highlighted that Travis is not the most physically imposing player, which could have also deterred recruiters. 
But what they both can agree on is that the lack of recruitment added extra motivation for the running back. He plays with a chip on his shoulder to prove people wrong. 
Three weeks into his time in Eugene, Travis had already proved it to Mastro.
It’s November 2020, two games into the pandemic-shortened season. The Ducks are playing at Washington State and it’s cold enough to turn your hands numb while taking out the trash, let alone carrying the football.
Temperatures are at a high of 41 but reach 39 near game time. One by one, position groups come out doing drills, and as the ball kicks off, there’s a rare sight on Oregon’s first drive. 
Dye is wearing gloves, something he hasn’t done since he was a little kid. 
“I said, ‘Travis, you’re gonna wear gloves.’ I mean, I used to coach at Washington [State]. I go, ‘Your hands are gonna get icy,’” Mastro said. 
Dye never wears gloves — it’s “too soft,” Chastain said, though it was the high school coach that implemented the no-glove mindset for the running back. Chastain told his players wearing gloves wouldn’t help them catch or block.
“It’s kind of what we preach,” he said.
Dye credits a comfort factor, highlighting he feels better playing without gloves. But, on this Saturday game day, he has no choice. Mastro has already made up his mind — Dye has to wear gloves. 
The coach was looking out for his player, but some things are better left alone. Just 12 minutes into the game, Dye fumbles the ball.
It’s the first time he’s fumbled since October 2019. 
“I was in the press box at the time and I could just feel the stare from the field, like, ‘You made me wear these gloves and I put the ball, we were out,’” Mastro said. “So from that point forward, I never said a word… Do what you got to do bro, you’re fine.”
In a way, the no-glove ethos is a testament to Dye’s mentality. He’s described as an old-school running back, someone more interested in his play than how he looks on the field. For him, production is paramount. 
“No sleeves, no gloves, no flash, no towels. Just wants to go out and ball out,” Mastro said. 
But there’s another layer to Dye’s success that often goes unseen — his leadership. 
It’s game day for USC, with pre-game warmups well underway. The Trojans stretch together to loosen up, then are separated into their respective position groups for drills. 
As time winds down and kick-off inches closer, a ball is punted in the air to signal the end of warm-ups. Players rush over to where the ball lands and gather in a circle.
A player then limps up with his helmet in hand, hair frizzy and mustache hanging ready for battle. All attention focuses on this one person.
Dye is about to give a pre-game speech. 
He preaches brotherhood, unity and for his teammates to “play for us,” redshirt senior offensive lineman Justin Dedich says. He talks about the game not being about the opponent, but about the team and how it can improve each week. 
“You could really feel everything that he feels in those pre-game speeches,” said senior inside linebacker Shane Lee. “It’s just that raw authentic energy that he gives that’s just so unique but it feeds the team.”
Dye’s leadership carries into the locker room right after the speech. He walks around handing out high-fives and words of encouragement to every player, making sure his message comes across. 
At Oregon, Mastro said the coaching staff would save Dye’s speeches for the biggest games of the season. Anytime he spoke, the team knew it was important. Dye understood the messaging and would emphasize what the team needed to do to win.  
Mastro said Dye’s speeches would be no more than two minutes long, but “captured the attention of the entire team and the coaching staff.”
When Dye talks, everybody listens.
“He’s that guy of the team,” said junior defensive end Tuli Tuipulotu. “He’s been to the Pac-12 [championship game], he’s been to the Rose Bowl. He’s been where we want to go so he knows what we have to do.”
Dye’s leadership carries to the practice field where he “does things the right way,” Chastain said. But it’s also where his competitive drive takes over; every drill is done at full speed, as Dye leads by example and pushes himself past his limits. 
Two-minute drills at Oregon’s Wednesday practices became Dye’s test. He wanted to be in every snap. 
“He did not wanna not be in there because it was two-minute against the defense,” Mastro said. “He did not want to lose that drill.”
Dye’s competitive nature stood out immediately to Chastain. Dye is someone as competitive as Mastro has ever seen in his 31-year-plus coaching career. Lee noticed the same. 
“He’s just different,” Lee said. “The way he plays the game, the way he comes to work, he’s just different.” 
Taking days off is just not part of Dye’s mentality, and it never hindered his play. While others may slow down as the seasons wane, Dye continues to push himself on the practice field and weight room.
Some of his best career games came during the last month of the season. 
His career-best 28 carries for 211 yards was in November 2021. Against Oklahoma in the Alamo Bowl last season, his 153 rushing yards were the third-highest of his career, second only to 199 against Oregon State in the last regular season game of 2018. 
And with USC’s season dwindling down, it wouldn’t be surprising if Dye’s production trends the opposite way. That rare combination of skill and competitiveness molds a player capable of lining up anywhere and giving his everything. Even at 5-foot-10. 
“I firmly believe if he was a full-time slot receiver, he would’ve been our best slot receiver,” Mastro said. “I firmly believe if he was a starting corner, he would’ve been our best starting corner… They don’t make many that can do what he does at that position.”

Father Time currently has LeBron James on a leash. 
If you know me, you know how much it pains me to say that. Kids growing up in the ‘90s had Michael Jordan; in the 2000s, they had Kobe Bryant. For me, growing up in the 2010s, I had LeBron James.
Watching LeBron claw his way to the NBA Finals nine times in ten years, it felt like he played with an immortal flair. Through the last decade, LeBron and the Finals were like Ross and Rachel in “Friends” — an inevitable match. 
To see LeBron look so human on the basketball court, so vulnerable, is disconcerting. On some nights, he feels like an afterthought, barely putting his stamp on the game. 
LeBron will still waltz into a 25-6-6 statline, because, even being less than two months away from age 38, that’s how easy basketball comes to him. But it’s a mundane 25-6-6 — opponents don’t feel LeBron anymore, that fear he used to put in their hearts as he barrelled down the lane. “I don’t think I see that spark in Bron,” James’ former teammate Kentavious Caldwell-Pope told ESPN this week. 
As he has aged, LeBron has combatted his dwindling explosiveness by becoming a legitimate jump shooting threat, but through 11 games this season, his shooting numbers have fallen off a cliff. 
He’s connected on a measly 17 of 71 threes, including a stretch where he missed 14 straight long balls. The catch-and-shoot numbers are worse — 6 for 32 to start the season. Gross.
When his jumper’s not falling, his only scoring option is to play “bully ball” to the rim, but he is still an elite playmaker, creating looks for his teammates off the drive-and-kick. The only problem is, just like LeBron, basically every Laker also can’t seem to throw a rock into the ocean. Through the Lakers’ first nine games this season, LeBron’s teammates shot 34.9% on 3s from his feeds but only 27.5% on wide-open 3s directly from a LeBron pass.
LeBron looks uninterested and disengaged, and it’s hard to blame him. The roster construction is completely backwards, with the 2-9 record indicative of general manager Rob Pelinka’s missteps. This is not a playoff-caliber team, and LeBron knows that. This season, all he’s playing for is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s scoring record — LeBron trails the greatest big man of all time by just over 1,300 points. 
It saddens me to watch one of LeBron’s final seasons minimized to record-chasing over win-chasing, a full year reduced to a short, passing moment of glory. Despite a lackluster start, he’s still LeBron — in the right system, he can still be a number one option on a championship team, and that’s why this lost season hurts so much. 
It isn’t all sorrow and heartache for LeBron, who deserves some of the blame too. He has played himself into this position, signing a questionable two-year extension with the Lakers in the offseason, penciling him in as a member of the Purple and Gold for another two seasons. 
What has Rob Pelinka shown LeBron to warrant the belief that he can put a good team together? How much trust does LeBron have in Anthony Davis to stay on the floor? Is it all just about playing with his son Bronny after one year of college?
The only reasonable conclusion I can come to after pondering LeBron’s extension is that it’s more about life outside of basketball, life in Los Angeles with his wife and three children. Maybe winning a fifth ring is a secondary priority for The King, and that’s completely fair — his career could end today and he’d still arguably be the greatest player to step foot on a court. 
He’s undeniably a winner, in spite of his 4-6 Finals record, so to see him lose regular season games while not even standing a chance just doesn’t feel right. But if his mind is not solely on basketball anymore, if he is not letting these losses bother him, why should I let it bother me, right?
Yet, no matter how awful the Lakers continue to look this year, a small part of me will always cling onto the hope that LeBron will be revitalized once again. 
In 2016, the LeBron-led Cleveland Cavaliers found themselves down 2-0 in the NBA Finals to the record-breaking 73-9 Golden State Warriors. This prompted Colin Cowherd, host of FS1 show “The Herd,” to spiral into a tirade, insisting, “LeBron James is 31, he doesn’t dunk as much, you’re not going to get a 45-point night from him, those days are over… he is not going to chase you down and block you from behind.”
Safe to say, LeBron made Cowherd look pretty foolish, ironically doing the exact things Cowherd said he was no longer capable of, dropping 41 points in Games 5 and 6, as well as arguably the greatest block of all time, chasing down Andre Iguodala in Game 7. 
LeBron could very well make me look foolish for writing this article too. And, to be honest, I really hope he does. Because I’m just not ready for LeBron’s career to be over.

If games could be won in the first half of play, then women’s volleyball might have left the Galen Center with a remarkable victory over a conference-leading opponent.
After a near perfect start, even in the face of adversity, USC never closed out the match — they instead saw a great Stanford team do it for them.
The Trojans fell to Stanford 3-2 on Wednesday, even after taking the first two sets of the match without standout senior Skylar Fields active in the contest.
“Stanford was a little bit more polished and a little bit more mature than we were,” Head Coach Brad Keller said. “I thought that we lost our identity at times and we had to get it back. It caught us off guard, and when you go five sets, it costs you.”
USC came out swinging, with 18 kills in the first set. Four each were attributed to the palms of freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson, senior opposite Emilia Weske and sophomore middle blocker Katelyn Smith.
Tied at 18, Weske made an incredible dig to keep the play in sequence before Smith hammered down a go-ahead kill off an assist from sophomore setter Mia Tuaniga. The Trojans did not surrender the lead for the rest of the set, finishing off the opening game 25-23.
USC jumped ahead despite committing 13 total errors, compared to Stanford’s eight. That figure was countered in part by the Cardinal’s complete absence from the net early in the game. The visitors did not record a single block, let alone a block attempt, in the opening set. 
That element of the game would change as it progressed, but Tuaniga made sure to set up the offense at the net early.
“I had a lot of confidence going to every hitter because everything was open,” Tuaniga said. “They’re a pretty big team. They’re really tall, so it was trying to find ways [to score] with my hot hitter and who’s doing well — like Jordan [Wilson] was doing really well this whole game.”
With Fields inactive with a lower leg injury, the freshman Wilson assumed the role of USC’s premier scoring option. The product out of Phoenix led the team with 21 kills on 50 attempts (.240) with nine errors. 
“It’s a huge responsibility, but I really do own up to it,” Wilson said. “Skylar [Fields] is a huge factor within our team, but we are still able to be a great team without her as she recovers.” 
The Trojans enjoyed their biggest lead of the night in the second set thanks to a team-low .208 attack percentage from Stanford. Little attack success and a couple of service errors from the Cardinal helped put USC ahead 20-13, but a subsequent four-point run from Stanford tightened things up. 
On set point, Wilson and graduate MB Kalyah Williams double blocked Cardinal redshirt junior OH Caitie Baird to win set two 25-21.
What could have been a decisive third set became a dramatic back-and-forth between two Pac-12 Conference foes. Seven lead changes in set three characterized the awakening of Stanford and its takeover of the game. 
AVCA All-America second team senior OPP Kendall Kipp started to catch fire with five kills in the third set alone. With its No. 1 scorer contributing, the Cardinal offense secured the team’s first set win 25-22.
While the Trojans held their opponent down for most of the fourth set, Stanford’s big hitters proved too much for the USC defense down the stretch.
Baird quickly erased her team’s 16-15 deficit with three straight kills in succession. When USC controlled the ball not long after, Tuaniga went on a three-score run as a server, including two emphatic service aces, but that only brought the Trojans as close as 22-20.
After a quick back-and-forth, USC’s Wilson had the serve leading 23-22 — just two points away from upsetting the Pac-12 leading and No. 8 in the nation Cardinal.
However, in a three point sequence, the 6-foot-5 opposite Kendall Kipp hammered down a kill to tie the game at 23, then served consecutive aces to steal set four 25-23.
“Kendall Kipp is a national team caliber type of player,” Keller said. “[She’s] playing at a higher level — physically higher level — than anybody else. Kipp is surrounded by a really good group, she has a really good setter, so she’s able to really grow as a player.”
In the blink of an eye, USC’s 2-0 lead was erased and it was headed for a first-to-15 final set.
An 8-2 run from the visitors to start the fifth all but put the game away, as Stanford was able to close out the Trojans 15-9 to complete the comeback victory.
USC, on a three-day turnaround from its last game, was unable to field its best player and ultimately suffered one of its most dramatic losses of the season in front of a home crowd.
Keller said that having a Wednesday game for the first time this season had a major impact on the decision to sit Fields, the Pac-12’s leading scorer, because of a shorter recovery window.
“Skylar [Fields] has a lower leg injury that’s day-to-day,” Keller said. “It was a game-time decision for her, and we chose what we chose. Hopefully we did the right thing for her health and longevity.”
The Trojans will cap off a four game homestand with a match against UC Berkeley on Saturday. The Golden Bears are 0-14 in conference play this season, but Keller will not allow his team to underestimate its opponent.
“They’re not what Stanford is, but it doesn’t matter,” Keller said. “Sam [Crosson] and that staff is incredible. They have physical pins and they can play the game at a super high level. They’re desperate for a win, which makes them the most dangerous team in the conference.”

Few people I know read the news for fun — and I have a lot of nerd friends. Perusing newspaper reports on Supreme Court decisions and congressional budgets is more of a painful exercise in patience and fortitude than a pleasant morning activity. 
Enter the world of magazines: These publications run a mix of commentary, profiles and what I like to call news-adjacent stories — articles that deal with current things in the news cycle but with a fresh angle or a more in-depth take.
Magazine reporting tends to be written in a first-person perspective, which often means it’s funnier and more entertaining than reading more hard news-y journalism. Personally, I’m actually far more likely to read all the way through a 5,000-word magazine profile than a 1,500-word news story.
Here’s a quick list of some of my favorite American magazines, and my thoughts on each; I’m judging these magazines specifically as a college student on the West Coast with a fairly limited budget.
The classic choice: The New Yorker 
Ask any person on the street to name a magazine, and there’s a good chance their first answer will be The New Yorker — well, maybe after Sports Illustrated and Playboy.
But unlike the latter two, this New York-based weekly is widely considered the epitome of long-form journalism, and rightfully so. This is the publication that printed John Hersey’s landmark “Hiroshima,” Seymour M. Hersh’s investigation of the sadistic torture of Iraqi prisoners in U.S. captivity and Ronan Farrow’s sweeping exposé of sexual misconduct in Hollywood.
Some of the most consequential journalism of the century can call The New Yorker home. 
That’s all well and good, but in all honesty, I’m not sure how much the average USC student is going to enjoy this magazine. At times, it can feel a little high brow, and there’s nothing particularly concise about this publication. Sitting down to read The New Yorker is like sitting down to read a book, and I’m not convinced that the average college student is looking for that.
Now, I am aware that this is sort of like a budding art student saying that the “Mona Lisa” is overrated, but I genuinely don’t think that this is the best magazine for a West Coast university student to subscribe to, assuming that student only has the budget to subscribe to one or two magazines. 
Personally, I quite enjoy reading The New Yorker, but it’s definitely one of my less utilized subscriptions.
Some other notes: The New Yorker’s humor section is unrivaled in its hilarity, and I appreciate the poetry and fiction sections. Its print layout is clean, minimal and undistracting, unlike most other magazines. You’ll also get a cool tote bag — that literally everybody else seems to have. The crosswords are too hard for me.
The current student rate is $49.99 for annual digital-only access, and $89.99 (with no student discount) for annual print and digital access. Three-month subscriptions are also offered.
The news-y choice: The Atlantic
If you meet the following criteria, you’ll probably enjoy The Atlantic: (1) You already somewhat regularly read The New York Times, (2) you don’t want to read pieces that are as long as The New Yorker’s and (3) you’re a liberal.
This magazine is pretty heavy on those “news-adjacent” stories and commentary, which are often long enough that you’re actually learning something, but short enough that you could read one during your lunch break in between classes.
The Atlantic’s suite of newsletters is the best of all the magazines on the list, although the publication only mails print copies ten times a year if that makes any difference to you. 
That said, I’ve definitely read more bad — like, really bad — pieces in this publication than I have in any of the other magazines in this list. At its best, The Atlantic publishes thoughtful and balanced commentary. At its worst, it can feel like liberals screaming into the void or just plain stupid. 
Still, the more concise and news-y format of The Atlantic serves as a good bridge for any regular newspaper reader looking to get into magazines. Just know that if you’re not all that into politics, this probably isn’t where your money is best spent — its culture and tech sections aren’t quite as robust as many others on this list.
The current student rate is $34.99 for annual digital access, and $39.99 for annual print and digital access. No monthly subscription is offered.
The in-between choice: New York
If I could only read one magazine ever again, it would probably be New York — not to be confused with The New Yorker or The New York Times. The magazine is divided into six different publications: Intelligencer, The Cut, Vulture, The Strategist, Curbed and Grub Street. 
Each covers its own topic area — politics, style, culture, food, etc. — a system which I find somewhat confusing, but am willing to stomach because I like the content. 
I’ve found Intelligencer’s political coverage to be the right mix between The Atlantic and The New Yorker in terms of length, voice and angle. Honestly, The Strategist is the only other section I read from, and that’s only when I want to meticulously fret over, say, the 13 best wool socks to buy or the best gifts to buy for every dad at every price point. 
Style, culture and food reporting don’t particularly interest me, but I have a sneaking suspicion that a lot of college students will appreciate the broad range of topics in New York. 
This magazine prints bi-weekly which is a perfect time interval for me, though I do the bulk of my reading online through its so-so suite of newsletters. The hilarious “Approval Matrix” alone might be a good reason to subscribe, and the crossword is my favorite of all these magazines — though it can sometimes feel very specific to New York, a city and state which I’ve never stepped foot in. 
As a side note, my New York tote bag is my favorite among all these magazines. 
The current rate is $50 for annual digital access, and $70 for annual print and digital access. No student discount is offered, though monthly digital subscriptions are.
The nerdy choice: WIRED
Perhaps politics and culture don’t particularly interest you, or maybe you’re just really into tech and science. Either way, WIRED is the way to go. 
The magazine is sort of like a print version of the tech YouTubers I used to religiously watch in my freshman year of high school, and is one of my most-read subscriptions — second only to New York. 
WIRED offers a solid range of newsletters, and I often find myself reading its particularly clever coverage of artificial intelligence technologies. The magazine also has a good range of product reviews akin to The Strategist, which I appreciate from time to time. 
If I could only ever read from one magazine again, it probably wouldn’t be WIRED, but its typically shorter pieces on more novel topics are an admittedly nice break from the politics and profiles of more “serious” magazines. 
The publication prints 10 times a year, though I honestly wouldn’t bother with a print subscription — it looks nice, but it’s quite ad-heavy and the content tends to be shorter, so I don’t mind reading even the long(er) stuff online.
The current student rate is $5 for both annual digital-only and annual print and digital access. 
The *different* (or Texas) choice: Texas Monthly
Here’s the curveball read: I’ve never even flown over the Lone Star State, nor do I plan to any time in the near future. But Texas Monthly produces some of the best journalism I’ve read. 
The magazine publishes the same kind of thorough profiles that The New Yorker does alongside political commentary similar to The Atlantic. The only difference is that pretty much all its journalism is within the context of Texas, unlike the other general-interest magazines on this list which usually write with a national slant — though, granted, those tend to skew East Coast in terms of general worldview.
Still, Texas is the second-most populous state in the U.S. behind California, and stories within the state can be harbingers of broader national trends. 
Texas Monthly tends to feel more down-to-earth than the East Coast publications, and it also feels like it’s meant for an audience slightly broader than the narrow spectrum of college-educated readers that most other magazines cater to; it’s great journalism. 
I should note that I’m not particularly fond of the very ad-heavy monthly print copies, but your student email address should be able to get you a print and digital subscription for the same price as a digital-only pass which doesn’t have a student discount option.
The current rate is $15 for annual digital-only access, but students can get an annual print and digital subscription for the same price. Monthly digital subscriptions are offered.

If you follow my private Instagram account, I sincerely apologize for the influx of posts that you’ve seen over the last few days. It’s been a really eventful few days for a few K-pop groups and their respective fanbases. 
Throughout my year of writing this column, I suppose I’ve never delved deep into the groups that I personally follow — my “ultimate” groups are Stray Kids, THE BOYZ and TREASURE. Aside from being fourth-generation boy groups with members of relatively similar age groups, one thing each of these groups has in common is their experience with members going on and off hiatus. 
In no way is the concept of a hiatus anything unique to these three groups — BTS have gone on several as a group — but it’s a concept I’ve grown very familiar with since becoming a K-pop fan of these groups specifically. And this past week, after a little over seven months, each of my three favorite groups officially have no members on hiatus currently, whether that be through members resuming their activities with their respective group or leaving permanently. 
While there’s no official definition of what a hiatus for a K-pop idol actually is, it usually occurs when an idol gets injured or sick (in order to let them get necessary recuperation time) or is involved in a scandal (so the story can blow over without too drastically impacting the idol’s group as a whole). 
The idol’s management company customarily issues a notification to fans via social media, and the idol takes a pause from all public appearances, which can sometimes even include a suspension in their versions of member-specific merchandise. Additionally, the other members of the group may or may not be allowed to discuss the member on hiatus publicly. 
Hiatuses, in general, are sad. Perhaps it has to do with the emphasis on unity that many K-pop groups emphasize — many fans often use the acronym “OT,” meaning “one true,” along with the number of members in their favorite group to show that they support all of the members of a certain group. Or, maybe it’s the strong personal connection many fans feel they have with their idols that makes not seeing new content featuring them for an extended period of time really difficult. 
But I wanted to write a column on this topic specifically not to talk about how it feels when your idol is on hiatus, but instead how it feels when their hiatuses end. 
THE BOYZ’s Eric, whose hiatus was announced at the beginning of March for health issues, ended his hiatus Monday with a tweet and a letter on THE BOYZ’s Fancafe social media platform, to the surprise and delight of fans around the world. “ERIC” and “BACK IN THE GAME SOHN,” a pun utilizing a THE BOYZ song lyric and Eric’s last name, trended on Twitter worldwide within two hours of his return. 
I celebrated too, texting my friends who also like THE BOYZ about his return all day and watching way too many music videos to be productive, all in the name of commemoration. 
But less than a day later, TREASURE announced that their two members that had gone on hiatus in late May, Mashiho and Bang Yedam, for health reasons and intentions to pursue a different career path, respectively, would be officially leaving the group, and that TREASURE would promote itself as a 10-member group moving forward. Fans responded frustratedly, trending “OT12” in multiple countries and asking TREASURE’s entertainment company for a more comprehensive explanation behind the decision. 
I, for lack of a better word, mourned this loss too. Friends sent me consolation messages and I watched even more music videos, this time in the name of remembrance. 
Writing all of this and talking about this with my friends who don’t follow K-pop, makes me realize it might all seem a little silly. But I think something that’s really interesting about K-pop is the relationships that it fosters — both between fans and their idols, but even moreso, between fans themselves. Seeing how much these idols mean to people is intriguing, but seeing how fans come together to celebrate what is essentially a loved one’s return, or to cry over a collective loss, perhaps is even more indicative of the community and space fans create for one another.

Hearts were palpitating in fervorous excitement Tuesday night at the Troubadour, which offered a homely haven from the pouring rain just outside the West Hollywood music venue. “2 British Friends 1 North America” is the slogan for Alfie Templeman and Thomas Headon’s joint 2022 tour — and a very fitting one, as their friendship and support for one another radiated throughout each of their sets.
Their friendship began as organically as all pandemic friendships did — through the internet. Members of the indie scene, they supported each other’s work online before finally meeting in person. This inevitably led to a collaboration and in 2021 they released a song together, along with Chloe Moriondo, called “Dizzy.” Flash forward a year later and the pair decided to tour North America together. 
Before they’d even come onstage, girls’ squeals were heard as the band members gave friendly waves from the backstage room above. Templeman opened the night with all the catchy, sugary buzz of  “Candyfloss,” one of his favorite songs to perform live from his debut album “Mellow Moon” which came out earlier this year. 
Kicks, jumps and spins between his carefree dancing raised the energy of the room right from the start. Templeman’s infallible charisma combined with his upbeat sound left fans with no choice but to give in to the music and dance their hearts out, or, as he put it, “boogie”! Concertgoers were rewarded with a new unreleased song called “Eyes Wide Shut” which he teased as having “a bit of a Kubrick vibe to it.”
The nineteen-year-old singer-songwriter-multi-instrumentalist also delighted long-time fans with the songs “Movies” and “Circles” from his 2019 “Don’t Go Wasting Time” EP, plus multiple others from his viral 2020 EP “Happiness in Liquid Form.” Some of these songs hadn’t been on the setlist for his last show in L.A. at the Roxy. 
This time around, the well-lit crowd, disco ball and decadent aromas from nearby food vendors created a vastly different atmosphere. Templeman finished his set off strong with “3D Feelings,” a song that effortlessly flaunts his talented singing and stellar songwriting, encapsulating “Mellow Moon”’s danceable melodies and lyrics’ underlying themes of comforting yet painful nostalgia. After setting the dancing tone for the night and hyping up his friend, he warmly conceded the stage to Headon. 
While Templeman set his guitar down for a maximum 10 seconds during his set, Headon picked up his guitar for only a couple of songs. This suited his performance style better since it gave him more liberty to move around (and off) the stage as he pleased. At one point in the show, he climbed on top of the drum set and got down on the ground with the crowd. 
Headon’s interactions with the crowd also included various instructions to follow, such as chants, crouching and raising hands in a rock n’ roll sign. His top Spotify songs “Clean Me Up,” “Strawberry Kisses” and “UrbanAngel1999” made it to the setlist. He invited those who didn’t know his lyrics to sing along to his covers of the Hannah Montana theme song “The Best of Both Worlds” and Taylor Swift’s “You Belong With Me.” He also pleasantly surprised fans with a new song titled “Georgia” which was released the next day.
To say Headon’s set was individualistic would be an understatement. If he wasn’t dancing literally on his guitarist, he kept busy by sticking his tongue out at people, asking about their coffee intake, making extended eye contact with everyone in the crowd, touching people’s heads in the front row, complimenting their hats or grabbing their hands. 
Once he’d gotten his fill of fangirl screams and felt like he’d broken enough hearts, Headon closed the night by gracefully requesting a round of applause for his bandmates and Templeman’s, then thanked the audience for taking the time to come to the show. Sadly, fans were left longing to see them both share the stage since they didn’t perform “Dizzy,” probably because they couldn’t without Moriondo. Who knows though, there’s always next year.
