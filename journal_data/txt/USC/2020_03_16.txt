A health care professional at Keck Medical Center has tested positive for coronavirus, the Department of Public Safety confirmed in an email to the USC community Monday, marking the second case of coronavirus publicly confirmed by the University. The individual is currently at home in self-quarantine.
The test result is considered presumptive and is awaiting confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the email. USC is currently working with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to look into possible exposures. 
A second individual under care at USC Verdugo Hills Hospital has also tested positive for coronavirus and is in isolation. However, the patient is not a member of the USC community. These two are most likely the first of many, according to the email.
“Given the available information through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, we expect that there may be more cases in the coming days,” the email read.
The email recommends that students with coronavirus symptoms visit USC Student Health. Student Health currently requires individuals with respiratory symptoms to make a TeleHealth appointment to evaluate their condition and determine next steps. Student Health offers testing exclusively for students exhibiting coronavirus symptoms.

USC has extended the period of remote instruction to the end of the semester, President Carol Folt announced in an email to the community Monday. The decision comes five days after the University announced it would transition to online classes for three weeks following spring break to mitigate the spread of coronavirus.
“We are fortunate that with your help we already moved to teach our courses remotely and online, limit campus activities, implement working from home, cancel or postpone events, intensify cleaning and hygiene, take extensive precautions to protect health care workers, and ensure that our clinics and hospitals are ready to care for those most in need,” the email read.
The University has not yet made a decision on commencement but will update the community when other issues associated with completing the current semester have been resolved, the email stated. Students will be able to complete the semester and graduate, although the University encourages international students to contact the Office of International Services with travel, visa and remote instruction concerns.
As the University updates its plan for commencement, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said USC is taking into consideration the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation to halt gatherings of 50 or more people for eight weeks, or until May 10 — five days before commencement. 
The recommendation does not apply to the daily operations of universities, schools or businesses, but events that draw members from outside the community, such as commencement activities, are discouraged. According to the email, USC events taking place through May 1 will likely be canceled or postponed, an extension of the original April 13 date.
All students, including resident assistants, who are able to return to their permanent residences have been asked to leave campus. Those who remain on campus are encouraged to practice social distancing and remain in their residences as much as possible to curb the spread of the virus. 
“The majority of students living in university housing left for Spring Recess, but many did not or were unable to for a range of reasons,” the email read. “For those who stayed in university housing, please be assured, we will continue to provide housing, food and support as we work with each of you to find a solution that fits your circumstances.”
Those who have left campus are advised not to return to collect their belongings until a safe and orderly process has been implemented. The University is determining how to allocate partial refunds for housing and meal plans for those who have left campus and said it would not have an update on the process for a couple of weeks. 
EVK has switched to a to-go format until further notice, and USC Village and Parkside dining halls have ceased operation. Starbucks at Trojan Grounds and Seeds Marketplace will remain open but with limited hours and services. Some restaurants, such as Cafe Dulce, in USC Village have moved to a takeout format as well. Most University buildings, including libraries, the USC Bookstore and recreational facilities, will close until further notice. Library resources and services will still be available online. Nonessential clinics will also close temporarily. 
This decision comes after Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s order Sunday to close certain public businesses, such as restaurants, movie theaters and gyms, to slow the spread of the virus. Garcetti’s mandate will remain in effect through March 31.
Staff also began working from home Monday. The University has told employees unable to perform their jobs from home that they can begin using their 10-day paid administrative leave. Employees will need to access accrued vacation time for additional pay if restrictions to University operations continue. These policies also apply to students with work-study.
“We also understand that financial uncertainties are increasing the burden of this situation on so many of you,” the email read. “We do not have all of the answers yet because the situation is still changing, but we will continue to do our best to answer your questions as soon as we are able.”
At this time, USC has publicly announced one case of coronavirus tied to the USC community. However, the student who tested positive is currently in Orange County after studying abroad in Europe and has not visited USC campuses recently, according to the University.
Van Orman said that while the risk of infection for students without underlying conditions was low, social distancing measures would help prevent community transmission and protect individuals who are immunocompromised.
“It’s so critical that people who have [coronavirus] diagnosed or have respiratory symptoms practice self-isolation, cover your cough,” Van Orman said. “Even if you’re not at higher risk, you — when you go out and interact in the world — you are at risk of spreading it to more vulnerable members of our community.”

Amid crisis, USC’s mishandling of information related to the coronavirus pandemic is telling. The administration’s disorganized communication of its health and safety policies has resulted in widespread confusion and anxiety among the USC community.
USC is no stranger to fumbling with transparency and integrity nor is it unfamiliar with crisis management. But instead of sweeping information under the rug, USC is providing vague and incomplete answers to the community, inducing panic and uncertainty. The University has lagged in providing individualized updates to students, faculty and staff, all of whom would benefit from the ability to plan ahead during this global health emergency. 
While the Daily Trojan Editorial Board recognizes that the coronavirus pandemic is rapidly evolving, we also strongly feel that the community deserves concrete and complete communication from the administration. We also understand that the Emergency Operations Center committee has to make decisions daily as circumstances continue to change, but that does not mean the University should keep its students in the dark in the interim.
It’s apparent that there have been big structural issues from the top down. Miscommunication has been evident based on different administrators’ conflicting explanations to the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media of how the University would be moving forward policy-wise, specifically in terms of housing. The provost told us Wednesday it would mandate that most students leave USC housing before spring break, then an hour later the University called us, upset that we had reported such because that was not the case.
Even with the most recent memo released Friday, there are many unanswered questions. While in-person classes are currently set to return mid-April, USC said it will continue evaluating the situation and adjust accordingly. However, many students, primarily those out of town, state or country, remain unsure regarding their return to USC. So, we’re imploring the University to notify people before the end of spring break about whether remote instruction will continue beyond April 13 to ensure students have enough time to plan ahead. 
Before Friday’s memo, an update which was sent more than half a day after USC had said it would be, the University struggled to address concerns that were circulating on campus and around the country. Particularly, USC was slow to determine the fate of certain in-person classes, such as labs and performances, and whether students could remain on campus. 
And while the University has done well in establishing a website dedicated to updates, it’s riddled with myriad links and hidden information, rendering it ineffective. Its various tabs are hard to navigate and, in some cases, provide vague guidelines that are not individualized for each group. For students studying abroad, the website provides little to no nuance for each program. This trend continues across the assorted tabs for faculty, staff and students. 
USC should put in the time and effort to give specialized help to those facing unique situations by providing guidance on a case-by-case basis. The administration must shoulder the burden of communication and not expect people to pour over decentralized links to figure out their next steps.
Just as the University was forced to quickly make difficult decisions, so was its community. The coronavirus pandemic is worrisome enough as it is, disrupting people’s access to health care, incomes and livelihoods. USC’s vague communication only exacerbates the frustration, anxiety and fear many feel. The last thing people need while making life-changing decisions that force them to choose between seeing their loved ones and going to work or staying at school to graduate on time is an administration that acts carelessly. 
For these reasons, the Daily Trojan Editorial Board calls on USC to centralize its communication to the community, providing clear and detailed updates within hours of U.S. and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention policy announcements. The University should also send individualized emails, videos and other memos at set times to the diverse people it houses, teaches and employs. Most of all, USC ought to consider its immense responsibility as an institution considered a home by faculty, staff and the student body, all of whom look to the school for communication at minimum, as well as a space to provide them with respite from the disarray we are met with now. 
It goes without saying that this pandemic has been distressing for the USC community, so we can understand that each decision being made isn’t made lightly or without the consideration of the greater good of the University and its stakeholders. At the same time, the measures USC is taking to inform us only serve to induce more fear and confusion, so we implore the University to do better before the situation worsens.
