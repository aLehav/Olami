To anyone who has made it this far in following my blog…you a real one. I feel like all of you deserve some sort of prize but since I spent all of my coins on sweaters in preparation for the fall (which never arrived), ya girl will just send you some “in spirit” type vibes. 
I decided to switch it up this week and instead of writing an article the regular degular shmegular kind of way I figured I would give you some of my thoughts at the end of every day to sum up my week. Shout out to you if you picked up on this Cardi B reference; You REALLY a real one! 
Sunday
I had planned on getting ahead on some of my assignments but like usual got distracted by Netflix. Although I didn’t make it around to that presentation for my COMM 400 class, I did enjoy two documentaries: 13th and The Hunting Ground. If you haven’t already seen them, they are a must, especially considering who is going to take office in January. #staywoke 
Monday
Queue rude awakening at 7:00 AM (and subsequent snooze x3). After sleeping in all weekend, I threw on the first thing I saw and headed to my 8:30 AM class. I left with no makeup, no coffee, and no sleep but somehow managed to power through a lecture about…honestly I forget because I was on autopilot. After tearing up at my to-do list, I banged out two of my assignments for the week and called it a night. 
Tuesday
LA Traffic. Work. Excel sheets. Crappy lunch at the office. Excel sheets. Staring at my computer. Contemplating quitting on the spot. Looking at the clock. Losing brain cells. Finally leaving! So happy!! LA TRAFFIC!!! SO ANGRY!!!! 
Wednesday 
I wake up from a really weird dream about me trying to swim during a tsunami. I quickly realize it is a metaphor for my life at this point. I remember I woke up early so I could try to look cute today…I regret this decision and roll back over in bed…sweatshirt and Nikes it is. At least it’s already halfway through the week. After a long-ass day in class from 8:30 AM to nearly 10:00 PM, I catch up on this week’s episode of Jane the Virgin and This Is Us. Another day, another dolla. 
Thursday 
I actually get to sleep in since I told my workplace I am taking care of my mom post-surgery today. Which I am…at 3:00 PM. *evil laugh* I let myself feel bad about ditching my exciting cubicle for the day for a maximum of three seconds. Like the title of this article says: peep it, pray on it, keep it pushing. I pick my mom up at LAX, nearly getting hit by a Hertz van. I’ve always loved when either of my parents come to visit me because it means a free meal, and a real meal at that, as in one that is served in a nice restaurant. 
Friday 
While you’re reading this, I’ll be watching my sister kick ass at the women’s volleyball game. She plays for Oregon so I’ll be rocking that forest green over cardinal red just for today. Also, my boyfriend will be meeting my parents for the first time (no pressure!) So hopefully I can come away with two W’s, one for the sis and one for the man.   
We are just a couple of days away from Thanksgiving Break and let me tell you, I don’t think I’ve ever been so desperada for a break. I will definitely be eating, drinking, and being merry. So whether you are posting up at Parkside for your turkey dinner or heading home for the holidays, enjoy your food coma before it’s back to school for finals!

“Immediately when you arrive in Sahara, for the first or the tenth time, you notice the stillness. An incredible, absolute silence prevails outside the towns; and within, even in busy places like the markets, there is a hushed quality in the air, as if the quiet were a conscious force which, resenting the intrusion of sound, minimizes and disperses sound straightaway…” –Former American composer, and expatriate in Morocco, Paul Bowles
I experienced Bowels words firsthand last weekend in Merzouga, a desert town in the Sahara. I arrived after a 12 hour voyage from Rabat around 7 a.m. and promptly watched the sunrise from the roof of our hotel. We then ate a light French-style breakfast: boiled eggs and bread with a variety of cheeses and jams, mint tea and coffee. 
Shortly after, we explored Merzouga–what looked like a small almost ghost town at the time (because shops don’t open until late afternoon)–which reminded me of the old Wild West I’ve seen depicted in classic American movies. While we were waiting for the shops to open, to pass time, my friends and I filmed a staging of two sheriff’s having a showdown over a damsel in distress in the middle of the empty road. Once the first shop opened, we headed over to buy scarves to wrap around our heads for our camel trek in the evening. The scarves protect against the heat, flies and sand from getting into eyes, ears and nose. 

Around 5 p.m., we hopped on our camels and trekked deep into the Sahara. We were headed to our campsite in the middle of the desert, where we would sleep for two nights. In my diary, I wrote, “Alhumdulillah (praise God), I still can’t believe I’m seeing this.” It’s so hard to capture the beauty of the Sahara on camera. We stopped at the top of a large sand dune and found an abandoned sled and sledded down the dune. I wonder how many people have ridden this sled on this very dune. We could see the Algerian border past a plateau in the distance. It was only 25 miles away. And just like that, the sun had set over the Sahara. 
“At sunset, the precise, curved shadow of the earth rises into it swiftly from the horizon, cutting into light section and dark section.”
At our camp, we met Latvians and Australians and shared chicken tagine with them. At night, our Moroccan guides played drums and sang traditional Sahrawi (natives of the Sahara) songs and we danced around the campfire. Camping in the Sahara desert was on my bucket list coming to Morocco and it was exhilarating to finally be experiencing it. 
Aziz, our guide, spoke about his life living as a nomad as the smoldering remains of the fire died down. He mentioned the sense of hospitality and community that all nomads have when they meet other nomads; they invite each other to stay at their camps and feed them until they move on to their next destination. 

Aziz owns a few camels and is hired by hotels to give desert tours. He emphasized how tourism has changed his life and employed him so that he can send money back home and raise a family. He emphasized living in the moment every day–never thinking or stressing about the future, but surviving in the present–the nomadic life in which nothing is still; everything is constant; It’s a test of survival, a hard life that requires the body and mind to be in sync, testing one’s willingness to go as far as possible for food, shelter and water. Aziz said that though his life is hard, he is very content with the lifestyle and wouldn’t give it up for anything else.
I appreciate his view, but in the time and place I am now in my life, I would almost have to pull a Chris Mccandless move to live this life–it’s not for everybody. Which leads me to my next point–I am extremely grateful for the experience to be exposed to people to live vastly different lives from from me; their lives are easier and harder at times. Often I think one gets stuck in his or her own little world and forgets to pause and realize that his or her problems are miniscule compared to others’. But this humility can only be bred if one has been exposed to other cultures and lifestyles, which is why it’s imperative to travel, close or far enough to step out of one’s bubble. 
“…When all daylight is gone, and the space is thick with stars, it is still of an intense and burning blue, darkest directly overhead and paling toward the earth, so that the night never really goes dark.”
At night, the Sahara is pitch black. There is no light pollution, which makes the stars appear brighter than ever. I saw four shooting stars. My friends and I took some mattresses to the top of a dune and lay on them and star gazed. We had some deep conversations about religion, our purpose in life, “finding ourselves,” “ignorance is bliss” and more.
Gazing at the stars, I had an existential moment. I didn’t want to return to society–my responsibilities as a student, an employee, a friend…I left all of that behind to savor the moment of refuge away from society. 
As I lay next to my friends, I had a moment of realization–I was never going to be able to experience this ever again–with these same people in this moment of time in my life–where I am so close to entering “adulthood.” This is a transitional and crucial stage in my life where my decisions within the next year will impact my future career.
Then my friend said something very important–because this moment would never happen again, it was even more pivotal to savor it in the present…which is what Aziz said to us around the campfire. My night was coming to a full circle.
Around 4 a.m., I woke up to the sound of hyenas scratching my tent. At first, I thought they were some of the others campers laughing and joking around, but then I heard them howl and knew they were not humans for sure. I was hyperventilating and trying not to make any sudden sounds to attract the hyenas. 
The next morning, we climbed to the top of the highest dune nearby and watch the sunrise. 
As I was walking, I asked my guide what to do if a hyena enters my tent, and he just said “They will eat you, there is no running away.” I couldn’t tell if he was joking or not.
“Then there is the sky, compared to which all other skies seem fainthearted efforts. Solid and luminous, it is always the focal point of the landscape.”
We then traveled by camel to a nomad hut, where we had “berber” pizza. It was similar to a calzone, fresh baked bread but with with vegetables inside. As we ate under the makeshift tent, we heard that one of our camel’s had passed away…we gave him a toast with our mint tea glasses. The rest of the day was relaxing. We read Under the Naked Sky: Short Stories from the Arab World and took turns narrating short stories.We played hangman, napped a bit, and explored the dry river bed. I found some fascinating fossils and a lot of snake holes, but no snakes. 

The desert sand is tangible, yet intangible at the same time. You hold it for a few precious seconds before it wisps out of your fingers with a gust of desert wind—the same wind that shapes the dunes and has been shaping the dunes for centuries.
I wonder if others who have been to the Sahara have seen the same as I do. The dunes slowly shift everyday…is the Sahara perpetually impermanent?
“The answer is that when a man has been there and undergone the baptism of solitude he can’t help himself. Once he has been under the spell of the vast, luminous, silent country, no other place is quite strong enough for him, no other surroundings can provide the supremely satisfying sensation of existing in the midst of something that is absolute. He will go back, whatever the cost in comfort or money, for the absolute has no price.”

“If people have their way, ‘we’re gonna be alright,’” moderator Manuel Pastor said, quoting rapper Kendrick Lamar, as he ended a post-election discussion on immigrant integration at the USC Caruso Catholic Center.
Natalie Reyes, a senior majoring in sociology and law, history and culture, appreciated Pastor’s humor and said that it lightened the “fear and anxiety of the undocumented community.”
Pastor moderated a panel of four members, focusing on immigrants’ emotions post-election and the effects President-elect Donald Trump will have on the undocumented community. The event hosted around 100 people.
The panel consisted of local immigrant rights advocate Anthony Ng, USC professor of political science Jane Junn, Citi Community Development Senior Vice President James Alva and Ismahan Abdullahi, director of civic engagement and community partnerships at Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans.
Ng spoke about his personal experience as an undocumented immigrant and how Trump’s election has affected him personally.
“The first three days after the elections were filled with fear. I felt that I was hated as a person of color,” Ng said. “A lot of us are still coping, but this fear is not going to make us stop fighting and stop hoping.”
The panelists described their post-election sentiments and the impact the results are having on their daily lives. Abdullahi, who is Muslim and a Somali refugee, said that the negative rhetoric by Trump has “affected our hearts and minds, and some of us are living through the fear.” 
She said that in the past year, hate crimes have increased 67 percent.
“Ten years ago, I could go to a quiet place to pray. The comfortability is not there anymore,” Abdullahi said. “We need to be more inclusive so individuals can exercise their rights as Americans.”
Along with personal accounts about immigration on the panel, Alva quantified the effects  a pathway for undocumented Americans to become citizens would have on the economy. He also explained how Citibank invests in immigration advocacy organizations.
“We provide funding to nonprofit organizations to help people become citizens,” Alva said. “The economy would increase between 37 to 52 billion [dollars] if people become citizens.”
Junn also explained that nearly 65 percent of voters, regardless of party affiliation, support a comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway toward citizenship.
After the panelists spoke, Pastor invited Linda Lopez, Los Angeles’ head of immigrant affairs, to speak about the city’s efforts to help undocumented locals, especially with the increase in hate crimes, which she said “brings the city great concern.”
“We are committed to our immigrant community here in L.A.,” Lopez said. “When it comes to law enforcement, Chief Beck has said they won’t comply with the federal government to deport people. This is the moment where we can build a bridge in our community.”
With regards to Los Angeles being a sanctuary city, Lopez explained that there is “different terminology” when it comes to sanctuary cities and said that the city has “really focused on policies and practices towards our immigrants” — for example, with Special Order 40 that prohibits LAPD from contacting residents specifically to ask about their immigration status.
Pastor also explained that for students, the event was important to shift focus to children and refugees who have been granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, in response to the President-elect’s rhetoric.
Reyes said she felt an atmosphere of unity at the event and plans to equip herself with more information to be good ally to her undocumented friends and family. 
“There’s still that fear for the unknown, especially with a lot of the promises Trump has made to repeal Obama’s executive orders, that have helped undocumented immigrants come out of the shadows,” she said. “It is important to build these communities and ties between different ethnic groups, so that the voices are stronger, so people can see that undocumented people contribute a lot more to society than what we know of.”

The Undergraduate Student Government, the USC Concerts Committee and the Conquest Committee organized USC’s 2016 Conquest Thursday in McCarthy Quad. 
The event featured a Ferris wheel, food trucks, a Bruin bonfire and a concert, among other attractions.
Before the concert, headlined by artists AlunaGeorge and Majid Jordan, student groups like the Trojan Marching Band and dance teams performed on stage as part of the rally. Trojan Pride conducted the traditional burning of a UCLA sign and Bruin bear in preparation for USC’s football game against UCLA in the upcoming weekend. 
“The activity that I’m most excited about by far is the Ferris wheel,” said Jacob Lester, a freshman majoring in English. “I expected all other aspects of Conquest, but the Ferris wheel adds an interesting flair to the whole event, and I’m interested to see what else Conquest has to offer.” 
Food trucks included Farmer’s Belly, The Boba Truck, Sweet E’s Bake Shop, Made in Brooklyn NY Pizza, Jogasaki Sushi Burrito and Wings N’ Waffles. 
The Conquest Committee spent about a year organizing logistics and designing Conquest 2016 to be distinct from other previous years’ events. According to the event’s marketing chair Eshaya Siriwardane and graphics design chair Emily Lu, organizing the event required much communication with both school authorities and outside organizations to become a success.
“We really tried to make this year’s Conquest different by rebranding it,” said Ruwandi Siriwardane, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “We really wanted this event to be about all of us coming together as a Trojan family to feel the USC spirit before we head into our big game against UCLA.” 
Lu said that the Conquest Committee added several activities this year to increase spirit even before the day of the event. 
“We tried to imitate Ellen [Degeneres]’s 12 Days of Giveaways before Christmas with Conquest this year,” Lu said. “We gave out freebies such as food items and merchandise over the course of the week to pump everyone up for Conquest, and we’ll be announcing the winner of two VIP tickets to an upcoming concert as well. Beyond our week before Conquest, however, we also had an overall change of image — in our Facebook event and posts — we’ve incorporated a special theme for this year with the Victory sign in a glitch-style video.” 
The Conquest Committee’s efforts have not only been to increase student participation and spirit for the USC-UCLA rivalry, but also to give students a greater sense of unity as active members of the Trojan Family. Joshua Chang, a senior majoring in business administration and an organizer of Conquest, added that one of the most important goals of Conquest is to increase student energy.
“At the end of the day, we want the Trojans to feel part of a bigger movement,” Chang said. “I think Conquest offers that energy to make us feel more as a team and more excited about the upcoming game.”

The USC Stevens Hall for Neuroimaging, a new neurological research building that contains the world’s largest repository of brain data, opened at the Health Sciences Campus Thursday afternoon. The facility was designed by Arthur Toga, a professor of ophthalmology and the director of the USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, and was made possible through a donation from USC Trustees Mark and Mary Stevens.
The ceremony began with a ribbon-cutting by President C. L. Max Nikias, who then invited guests to tour the new building. Nikias also delivered a speech regarding the impact he believes this building will make on research and innovation in the field of neuroscience.
“We are on the verge of ushering in a golden age of medicine and biology,” Nikias said. “Neuroscience and brain sciences in particular hold a unique place for us within medical science because within the modest space of the human brain rests a vast and infinitely complex universe of its very own.”
Stevens Hall currently houses the world’s largest bank of information about the brain, with 2,867 terabytes of data from every continent other than Antarctica. In the coming year, the institute will receive the world’s only Siemens 7T magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, machine to conduct detailed and accurate brain scans. 
The new building also houses the Data Immersive Visualization Environment presentation theater, where researchers can project sets of data and highly magnified images on a 12-by-15-foot screen in ultra high definition. These high-tech features, Mark Stevens said, will allow the institute to conduct further research into the causes of several illnesses.
“The dream for all of us is … via the research that will go on here in this new facility, to find solutions to a whole range of diseases that ravage all of our families,” Stevens said. 
Nikias ended his speech by thanking the Stevens family for their contribution once more.
“Mark and Mary have earned the Trojan Family’s enduring respect and gratitude,” Nikias said. “For their commitment to this university and its Trojan Family, for your compassion for those who suffer, for your commitment to unleashing the best within the human mind and spirit, we thank them once again.”
