Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism invited more than 140 students to participate in a Zoom Q&A with the head of the NBA human resources department Eric Hutcherson Friday. The Q&A was led by Annenberg Dean Willow Bay and covered the league’s strategy during the coronavirus crisis and the virus’ implications on professional basketball. 
The talk was part of Annenberg’s newly launched program Annenberg Intelligence, a series of Zoom conversations with industry leaders and alumni in order to make up for the spring semester’s canceled on-campus events and job recruiting opportunities. Hutcherson discussed the NBA’s own initiative to continue its community outreach through NBA Together, a campaign currently pushing medical information and pandemic relief efforts. 
The NBA was the first professional league to suspend the remainder of its season March 11 after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus. Hutcherson outlined HR’s role in maintaining inclusivity and workspace health when the workplace itself is scattered across homes and geographies. 
“Home right now is taking precedence,” Hutcherson said. “So it’s really important for employers, ourselves, in particular, to remember that we infiltrated the home life, and so trying to figure out how to take care of school and take care of life and take care of family and deal with illness and then at the same be productive at work has been a real challenge.”
The NBA has amped up its communication and created new task forces in light of its continued operations and planning for hypothetical outcomes of the coronavirus crisis. Hutcherson provides town halls and panels for employees to tune into that cover topics such as the disparate impact of the coronavirus on communities of color. 
The task forces span different scenarios and continents, with one planning the logistics of a remaining 2020 season and one covering a 2021 comeback. Others focus on different international markets and how to operate under varying government policies regarding social distancing and economic reopening.
Hutcherson also emphasized how uncertainty still persists as the decider of future plans with the facts about the pandemic changing every day. The coronavirus upended not only its game operations but the transition of the NBA’s next generation of draftees. With the NCAA Tournament canceled, many college players lost the chance to improve their stock value to professional teams, and with the G-League’s suspension, the players’ journey to an NBA lineup may be delayed.
Despite the looming economic consequences of the pandemic, Hutcherson projected confidence and a willingness to adapt to the circumstances that the NBA is facing. 
“The way we’re looking at [it] is in times of crisis, you get access to talent that you otherwise wouldn’t get access to,” Hutcherson said. “And so we’re using that as an opportunity hopefully to continue to grow.”

With the toll that the coronavirus pandemic has taken on just about everything sports fans had to look forward to this spring, seeing the best day of many football players’ lives unfold on screen seemed like the perfect remedy. 
Thanks to ESPN, however, the 2020 NFL Draft essentially became a highlight reel of the worst days of draftees’ lives, doing little to distract from the sadness people across the country are feeling with the pandemic and certainly not doing any favors for the draftees themselves.
Stories of players overcoming obstacles have always been a component of draft coverage, but this year, it seemed that the infographic for nearly every draftee referenced some sort of personal tragedy. And as if simply mentioning the player’s horrific circumstance wasn’t enough, the broadcasters often elaborated on these stories in great detail as somber piano music played in the background.
When former Utah State quarterback Jordan Love was drafted in the first round by the Green Bay Packers, the discussion should have centered around the implications on franchise quarterback Aaron Rodgers’ future in Green Bay. Instead, after briefly comparing the circumstances of Love’s selection to those of Rodgers’ in 2005, ESPN spent a few minutes of airtime on the suicide of Love’s father, going into detail about what may have caused him to take his own life.
After receiving backlash from viewers about the broadcast’s overreliance on “sob stories” like Love’s, ESPN defended its tragedy-focused coverage as a way to provide insight into players’ lives off the field.
“Our NFL Draft coverage analyzes the prospects on the field and introduces the human side of the players by telling their stories, including the obstacles their families have overcome as part of the journey to the NFL,” ESPN said in a statement to The Athletic Saturday.
But the network continued to come under fire, especially for the content it included in various player infographics. The graphic for former Clemson wide receiver Tee Higgins read, “Mom, Camillia, fought drug addiction for 16 years.” A screenshot of the graphic went viral on Twitter, as fans wondered why ESPN would choose to casually include such personal information on the screen alongside Higgins’ hometown and other collegiate scholarship offers.
Fans were also confused when former Wisconsin wide receiver Quintez Cephus’ graphic detailed the legal trouble he faced in college. They couldn’t fathom that Cephus would have given the go-ahead for ESPN to broadcast this information to millions of viewers. Yes, disciplinary issues can be a concern for a player’s future in the NFL, but ESPN chose to lead with the fact that Cephus was accused and charged, rather than emphasizing his acquittal.
Although Higgins tweeted that he had “no problem” with ESPN elucidating his mother’s battle with addiction because he is proud of how far she has come, I doubt all of the draftees were pleased with seeing their draft announcement and a little bit of game tape before reliving their biggest hardships via national broadcast. 
ESPN vice president of production Seth Markman apologized about the content of the Higgins graphic in a statement to the Washington Post Sunday but did not mention how any other players were depicted, including Cephus.
“It was a mistake and we apologize for it,” Markman said. “We want our draft coverage to personalize players and, where appropriate, acknowledge the obstacles they’ve had to overcome on their journey to the NFL. This graphic lacked proper context.”
While I understand that ESPN’s goal is for viewers to get to know the draftees, there is a time and place for certain types of stories, and the draft — which is supposed to be uplifting and a cause for celebration — is not the time to talk about criminal records and the deaths of parents a decade ago. If players like Higgins are open to sharing these stories with the world at a later date, then so be it. Include it in a short documentary or another broadcast, but let’s minimize such content in the draft.
Even if every player had consented to ESPN revealing the darkest aspects of their past, it was also just not what fans needed from a broadcast that was supposed to be a reprieve from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Perhaps the most striking story was that of former Penn State defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos, who lost his father and older brother in two separate tragedies. Gross-Matos’ father drowned trying to save 1-year-old Yetur when he fell overboard on a boating trip, and his older brother was fatally struck by lightning while playing baseball. 
These events seem too tragic to be true, and I can see why ESPN jumped at the chance to reveal what must have been formative parts of Gross-Matos’ life. But when so many people are feeling depressed over the apparent lack of control they have over their lives due to a global pandemic, Gross-Matos’ story — along with several others included in the broadcast — only served to underscore the notion that life can be devastatingly unpredictable.
With Gross-Matos’ permission, his story would make a compelling documentary for viewers who know what they’re getting into. But showing tragedy after tragedy on the broadcast is no way for players to celebrate achieving a lifelong goal or fans to celebrate one of the first major sporting events in a long while. It’s no way to make people feel good when they might not have a lot to feel good about otherwise.
It’s more than possible for ESPN to cut down on the dramatic — in fact, there’s so much potential for other types of content in the draft. I would have loved for the announcers to spend more of the time between picks focusing on each team and how the draft was going for them, essentially showing the “winners and losers” of the draft.
It also would have been interesting for the broadcast to incorporate interviews with draftees’ college coaches and get their reactions to their former players being selected. The coaches could have provided insight as to how each player has grown and can be an asset to their new NFL team, allowing ESPN to highlight a player’s development without desperately bringing up tragedy.
Ultimately, I started to feel like I was watching “American Idol” rather than a sporting event, because the players that stood out on the broadcast the most were often the ones with the most devastating backstories rather than those with the most impressive game tape.  
The NFL Draft is one of the best celebrations in sports. Given that distinction, it doesn’t seem like it should be controversial to suggest that ESPN’s coverage should focus a lot more on the celebration, and a lot less on trauma porn.

Americana folk duo Mandolin Orange played a virtual benefit concert via live stream on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook Sunday. With a range of featured instruments including the guitar and mandolin, Andrew Marlin and Emily Frantz reflected an eclectic modern and traditional bluegrass musical style.
The duo donated half of the evening’s contributions from fans to the Compass Center, a service center in Chapel Hill, N.C., that provides critical resources to people experiencing domestic violence. The cause follows the rise in domestic violence occurrences; an article from The New York Times pointed directly to a rise in calls to domestic violence hotlines with abuse reports as a result of the pandemic. 
After tuning instruments, Marlin and Frantz’s performance began with an older track “One More Down” from their 2010 album “Quiet Little Room.” Frantz played the guitar while Marlin was on the mandolin. While playing together, the duo displayed a unique sound that brought in elements of late 19th century American roots music typical of bluegrass and folk genres. Sitting behind a large glass window in their house, with rain pattering down in the background, Marlin and Frantz’s performance was intimate and warm.  
At the end of the song, Marlin noted how nice it was to play with no microphones. The two went on about the differences between live performance and virtual concerts. 
“[It] feels weird when the song ends and there’s no applause,” Frantz said. Seeing the tiny rainbow hearts coming in on the screen from fans on the virtual live show helped, she added. 
“The thing about playing a normal show is that we have to choose what instrument we’re going to play before we walk out on stage, actually before we leave for tour, and the dangerous thing about this scenario is that we can switch instruments at any time,” Frantz said. “I guess that’s fun though, right?” 
Throughout the night, the two traded smiles and sang harmoniously on some of their classic records. The harmony of the vocals between Frantz and Marlin was incredibly beautiful and touted their obvious musical connection as they played their iconic records such as the second selection of the night, “Old Ties and Companions.” 
When trying to decide Sunday night’s setlist, Mandolin Orange revealed that the two came up with a mixture of tunes from their past and present work, one of which they hadn’t played in a show in eight years. The song, “Lonely All the Time,” fit the present atmosphere as the country practices social distancing. With lyrics like “There was a time when I was able / To sit down at the table / With the ones that I love most in life / Now my days have grown so bitter / Lord knows they get no better / I’m so tired of being lonely all the time,” the duo encapsulated feelings of yearning and solitude. 
Frantz told viewers the group could hardly manage to get through a previous rehearsal without laughing because they kept thinking about the  song’s relevancy. 
When the duo began playing “Lonely All the Time,” comments on Instagram and YouTube flooded with support, showing love from all around the country, with people reminiscing on old memories, weddings and times spent with friends. One comment from a viewer on YouTube read, “Your music is making every day a little easier through all this.” 
Mandolin Orange’s song selection encompassed a range of emotions throughout the evening. Tones of longing, nostalgia and hopefulness filled the night. Most of the emotion that came from the duo had to do with the sentimental and reminiscent undertones of Marlin and Frantz’s songs as they shared their personal accounts and experiences in their lyrics. 
The duo also performed “Turtle Dove and the Crow,” which Marlin wrote for his father. During the selection, Frantz switched from guitar to the violin, adding a whole new layer to the duo’s performance as it echoed their vocals. The violin, often found in classical music, created a rich, deep, lyrical accent for this song in particular. 
Following “Turtle Dove and the Crow,” Mandolin Orange played “Hey Stranger,” “The Wolves,” “Lullaby,” one of their newest songs “Belly of the Beast” and “Take this Heart of Gold.” The performance ended on “Amsterdam,” with Mandolin Orange then thanking viewers and expressing hope in “seeing” them again soon with another virtual live performance. 
The live stream video of the concert is on Mandolin Orange’s YouTube channel.

Are people actually lining up at Trader Joe’s for food or just buying liquor? How many days (or hours — no judgment) can the bottle of wine I’m currently drinking last me? Can Jesus turn my water into wine? If you are like me, shelter-in-place orders have made you mindlessly unproductive. Yet, I want you to know that it is time to embrace this moment. I am no longer holding myself to the productivity standards made for a non-pandemic world in the times of the coronavirus. 
Now is the perfect time to spiral down a Wikipedia search hole, especially with a glass of red wine. What used to be mundane browsing on who was the American president during “Downton Abbey” might just lead you to a life-changing discovery of inspirational quotes by Teddy Roosevelt. You might be inspired to become a keyboard detective like that lady from Netflix’s “Don’t F*ck With Cats” and go on a “journey,” or perhaps, we might be able to solve climate change after all. 
Open up a bottle of rosé and devour the Gen Z online favorite known as Zoom Bachelor. Look it up, I’m not joking. You might even be searching for love yourself or some Zoom dates in your near future. I would definitely recommend a bottle of wine for that particular occasion because at least then, if the date goes bad, you’ll still have the wine to enjoy. 
I have also recently rediscovered the time-killing, energy-draining activity that is The New York Times Sunday Crossword Puzzle (virtual, of course, as you cannot Lysol a physical newspaper, but trust me, I tried). Add a glass or two of wine to the mix, and you’ll have a whole Sunday afternoon occupied! An activity that was once only supposed to take an hour or two can last you until dinnertime. Now that is a miracle. 
If you have not attempted to write some poetry while drunk on wine, I suggest you give that a shot. Poetry makes so much more sense to me now. Whether you’re lamenting about your ex or intently focusing on the motif in the film “Brokeback Mountain,” a glass of white wine makes the experience so much more magical. It is almost as if you are among the greats of Robert Frost and Emily Dickinson. I now greatly empathize with Dickinson’s quote: “Tuesday is a deeply depressed Day.” I treat my Tuesdays as my middle of the week (Wednesdays) because my last day of classes are on Wednesdays, so it’s sort of like a Friday for me. But now every day has  turned into a stream of nothingness.
Lastly, to all my graduating Trojans out there, now is the time to start brainstorming our celebratory wine selections for our virtual graduation ceremony. Due to the outbreak, grocery delivery times will be delayed and our wine selection might not be ideal if left to the last minute. Get your wine orders in now, my friends. I am personally thinking about going with a pinot grigio for the day. Whatever my choice ends up being, I am definitely sticking to white wine because I do not plan to fall asleep for the “special” activities that USC has planned for us. 
Wherever you are reading this, I hope this column has brought some laughter and joy in your life. All jokes aside, I really want to stress the importance of finding joy even in a moment like this. I also understand that not everyone is in a situation where they have the luxury of being bored and not stressed. Whatever your situation, I hope you will join me in a toast to the blessing of being healthy and alive.

Pedro Noguera will serve as the Rossier School of Education’s new dean, Provost Charles Zukoski announced in a memorandum to the USC community Monday. He will take office July 1.
Noguera currently works as a professor of education at UCLA’s Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. He will replace Karen Symms Gallagher, who has led the Rossier school since 2000 and chose to step down to a Rossier faculty position effective June 30. 
“Dr. Noguera, who will be the Emery Stoops and Joyce King Stoops Dean of Rossier, joins USC as the school and university community together chart a safe path toward a post-COVID recovery,” the email read. “He will draw on his deep experience to hold the school’s mission paramount — to prepare leaders to achieve educational equity through practice, research, and policy.”
Noguera currently serves on the board of the Economic Policy Institute, the National Equity Project, The Nation magazine and City Year Los Angeles.
Noguera has previously taught at New York University, Harvard University and UC Berkeley. He was also appointed as an education policy adviser to the governor of New Mexico and advises the state departments of education in Washington, Oregon and Nevada. 
“President Folt and I very much look forward to Dr. Noguera’s partnership with our senior leadership team,” Zukoski’s email read. “We know he will bring intellect, enthusiasm, and creative ideas to our team.”
According to the email, Noguera has won awards for research and advocacy in the fight against poverty from Stanford University’s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, the National Association of Secondary School Principals and McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at NYU. He has also received seven honorary doctorates. 
Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Willow Bay and Interim Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs John Matsusaka spearheaded the search committee for the next Rossier dean. The search began last fall after Gallagher announced her intention in May to not apply for a fifth term as dean.

USC social media is full of students who seem to be making the most of quarantine, from Thornton students performing concerts at home to Marshall students raising money for local businesses. Independently, many students on social media seem to be thriving as they develop new exercise routines, learn new skills, discover new hobbies and constantly find new and innovative ways to make the most out of a difficult situation.
These examples flooding social media exemplify the best of the Trojan spirit, highlighting students’ resilience, ingenuity and creativity; however, the constant influx of one-sided positivity can also make struggling students feel marginalized and further isolated. The USC community should celebrate the resilience of all Trojans by being sensitive to the multitude of current experiences, both good and bad.
Students might feel inclined to categorize themselves as either optimists or pessimists depending on their responses to the chaos and stress of this pandemic, but despite endless BuzzFeed quizzes, these labels are ultimately shallow indicators of complex human personalities and behaviors.
The labels attempt to organize how individual people respond to the same stimuli, but what is inconsequential to one person might be catastrophic to another who has radically different personal reference points and life exposures. As a result, these labels tend to flatten and minimize the complexities of human experiences, disregarding how one’s past shapes oneself.
A study in the British Journal of Social Psychology examined self-categorization as an identity-forming experience and a response to stress. While it might be natural to self-identify and categorize, it is detrimental to enforce these labels onto other people. Some students will invariably handle this crisis better than others. These are students who likely also have the financial security, community and familial support to weather this pandemic relatively unharmed. 
Before students dismiss their friends or classmates as negative or pessimistic in their response to the pandemic, they should consider how their peers’ experiences might differ. There are Trojans who are housing or food insecure. Trojans who have lost their job. Trojans who are at risk of falling ill. Trojans who have lost friends or family members. Trojans who struggle with mental illness exacerbated by the pandemic. Trojans who have returned home to a negative or abusive environment.
Even Trojans lucky enough to have safety and security will still struggle immensely from the mental stress of this pandemic. According to Vox, prolonged loneliness contributes to depression, anxiety and physical health problems. The toll of this pandemic on mental health alone is its own crisis. Students, professors and administrators must be sensitive and compassionate toward one another. 
By minimizing the harsh reality many students face, the USC community unwittingly enforces a cult of positivity. It is wonderful that some students have the chance to thrive under these conditions, but not every student receives the same opportunities. This blind optimism erases their experiences and makes them feel further isolated.
Sharing a negative experience does not make someone a pessimist when the reality itself is truly negative. Students cannot secure a job or cure their depression by simply changing their attitude. Being realistic about their trials and tribulations does not mean a student is simply complaining. Moreover, a January article from The New York Times explains that complaining itself helps people process their emotions and bond with others.
Psychology Today finds a significant difference between blind optimists who subscribe to a cult of positivity and realistic optimists. The former tends to overlook real problems and prevent others from sharing their grief, pain, anger, loneliness and fear by making them feel guilty just for having these negative feelings.
By ignoring negativity, blind optimists can make their small problems even bigger. On the other hand, psychologist Julie Norem describes how so-called pessimists effectively “[transform] anxiety into action” by defensively imagining and then preparing for the worst.
USC students need to meet their friends and classmates where they are. If a friend reaches out and describes how they are struggling with the current situation, just telling them that everything will be OK and not to worry dismisses their experience. Instead, honestly listen to their concerns and anxieties.
In the same vein, throwing out a litany of well-meaning suggestions such as yoga, meditation or podcasts may make you feel helpful, but it might make your friend feel minimized. These can all be good coping strategies, but they won’t work for everyone.
For all the Trojans out there who are struggling and whose experiences do not seem to match up with their classmates’ cheerful and ultra-motivated social media posts, remember that Instagram is not reality. People post finely-curated representations of their lives and often try to cope with their own negative experiences by exuding a perfected life online.
USC can create a stronger, more compassionate Trojan Family by recognizing the multiplicity of positive and negative situations students are currently experiencing and by normalizing the experiences of those who are struggling. At the end of the day, USC is a family, and Trojans should support one another accordingly.

In a typical year, May 1 marks National College Decision Day, a celebratory milestone for high school seniors who, after months of uncertainty, firmly commit to the college they will attend in the fall. However, as we all know, this is anything but a typical year. 
With drastic changes to higher education and the world at large caused by the coronavirus, the looming deadline of May 1 has undoubtedly taken on a new meaning for the incoming Class of 2024. Because of this, USC should extend its commitment deadline from May 1 to June 1. 
The earlier students enroll, the easier it is for schools to assess their fall revenue and consider logistics such as housing. Usually, a deadline of  May 1 makes sense in this respect, but in these unprecedented times, flexibility is key. 
The reality of the coronavirus pandemic means there is potential for drastic updates and changing circumstances every single day. Although the pandemic will not miraculously disappear in a month, postponing the deadline to enroll in June will give both students and universities more time to understand what the fall semester has in store — for better or worse. 
When a prospective student commits to USC, the University requires a $300 nonrefundable deposit and submission of a housing application. With a record number of 26 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits in the last five weeks — a number sure to increase — the financial security of many households is no doubt precarious. Due to a constantly evolving situation, families may not know if they will be able to afford USC’s $57,256 tuition months from now.
As universities across the country are unsure if in-person classes may even resume in the fall, it is unfair to expect students to commit to schools — and their respective tuitions — without any certainty concerning the future state of instruction. In this regard, families’ hesitation to pay a nonrefundable deposit toward tuition is completely understandable. 
The quality of online classes does not hold a candle to in-person classes, and families want to be sure they are putting their hard-earned money toward an education at USC, not Zoom University. Allowing students to enroll in June will give families a much-needed month to better assess their financial situation and the future impacts of the virus. 
More than 400 universities have already extended the deadline to commit from May 1 to June 1, while many others have maintained their May 1 deadlines. This leaves students in a predicament, for if some colleges extend their deadline and others don’t, many students will still need to make their choice by May 1. 
With most states under stay-at-home orders, students cannot visit different campuses — often a crucial factor in making the decision of which university to attend. An extra month to commit will give students time to sift through virtual tours or reach out to current students with questions. Although there is no substitute for a prospective student walking down Trousdale or seeing students biking on their way to class, it is the closest thing students have to an in-person experience at the moment. 
High school seniors are facing an ominous 24-hour news cycle, the cancellations of end-of-the-year events and complete uncertainty surrounding their freshman year of college. What was supposed to be a time dedicated to the celebration of their achievements has now turned into months of complete isolation and unpredictability.  
Although many other people are dealing with more extreme stressors, this does not make high school seniors’ worries invalid. In fact, they are very real and understandable. Even if USC cannot remedy their anxiety completely, moving the deadline to commit from May 1 to June 1 shows the University’s support for the incoming Class of 2024 and gives these students just a bit longer to navigate a cloudy future.
