The volleyball came spinning down from the opposite side of the net with the power and speed that can only come from a 6-foot-3 man. It smacked freshman setter Raquel Lázaro square in the face. The impact took her to the ground, but she quickly rolled over and stood on her feet with her usual smile, her arms wide open toward her teammates as they huddled before the next play. 
At the end of a Tuesday afternoon practice in Galen Center, the USC women’s volleyball team were preparing to face Oregon State and Oregon at home later that week with a scrimmage featuring the starters against the rest of the team and some male practice players from USC’s club team. After a full day of classes and hours of practice, Lázaro was giving her teammates all she had left. 
She spent six years building this resilience on the Spanish national team, competing for her native country on the Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 teams. The national team coaches first noticed Lázaro when she was 13 and invited her to see what the team was like in a camp setting. She spent the next five years living in Soria, Spain, practicing four hours a day while being a high school student. 
Lázaro’s big break came when she was 16. After a player on the senior team was injured, she was called up.

“It was three weeks [of practices],” Lázaro said with eloquence. “They were so hard because practicing with the first team is a big deal.” 
She got the call for the 2017 European League Championships, where she played in eight matches with the senior team. USC recruited Lázaro after associate head coach JJ Van Niel saw her film while he was an assistant coach  at Utah last season.
After committing to USC, Lázaro spent the summer before freshman year playing in Spain, forcing her to only FaceTime her USC teammates and coaches from abroad. She didn’t arrive in Los Angeles until three days before the team’s picture day. 
“She got here, [and] she was exhausted,” women’s volleyball head coach Brent Crouch said. “She had just been on an overnight flight from Madrid. But even with the jetlag, she was full of energy. Clearly, she was fatigued, but you could tell right away that she’s somebody that just carries a nice, natural amount of positive energy and vibes with her all the time.”
She immediately began to adjust to life in America. 
“My first impression was ‘This kid’s funny,’” said sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin, who has become a close friend. “She has a good personality.”
Lázaro has become hooked on sweet American cereal. Frosted Flakes is now a staple in her morning breakfast routine. She described the goodness with wide eyes and the same shy but bright smile that she displayed when pretending to pose for a photo and demanding that the photographer “get her good side.” 
Her initially modest, yet humorous personality helped her to connect with her teammates in ways that even her coaching staff did not expect. But Lázaro still struggled to overcome cultural barriers, despite knowing English. 
“I thought it was going to be more like Europe, but it isn’t,” Lázaro said. “It’s very different. We’re more empathic, we think [about] everyone that’s … next to us. And here people go more for themselves.” 
She had to transition to a new culture, yet still remain herself.

“The most difficult part for connecting with people was I didn’t know what to talk about with them,” Lázaro said. “There have been moments where I feel like a stranger here, but others that I feel like I was back … home.”
She credits her comfort level to her teammates, who have stepped in as her family in America and look out for her as she looks out for them. Warmth naturally radiates from the smile that crinkles her eyes when she hugs her teammates on the sidelines. Being supportive is in the job description of a setter, especially for one who runs a 5-1 offense for the No. 14 team in the nation. She sets in every rotation, while blocking in the front row and digging in the back row. 
“As a setter, you have to be a leader. You’re the quarterback of the team,” Botkin said. “You’re in charge of making sure the pass is good [by] being on top of those passers, and also being on top of your hitters and providing good sets.”
It can be a daunting task for an 18-year-old freshman, but Lázaro handles the tough coaching and criticism well. The tempo and plays of Crouch’s offense were new to her during training camp, but she caught up seamlessly. Lázaro has collected 815 assists this year, with a career high of 59 against Arizona State on Oct. 12. 
“You never see anything from her other than just connecting and ‘Hey how’re you doing?’ and ‘I’m gonna do this’ and ‘Let’s go’ and ‘You can do it,’” Crouch said. “And it’s just all the time with everybody in every activity. It’s really astonishing how consistent she is at that.”
While leading the offense, Lázaro also has to make sure that her block is solid and consistent, and that she’s executing on back row defense. She has picked up 200 balls this season by sprawling all over the right side of the court, getting touches and making quick moves to keep it alive. Out of 19 games, Lázaro has recorded nine double-doubles. 
Crouch noted that since coming to USC, her serving has improved significantly. Lázaro came in with a top-spin serve, but she developed a deadly jump float that served UCLA off the court when USC swept its rival at Galen Center on Sept. 19.  Her six aces gave the Trojans the lead they needed to eventually beat the Bruins 25-8 in the second set. 
“She was a big reason why we did so well against UCLA,” Crouch said.

Lázaro’s fourth Pac-12 Freshman of the Week award followed USC’s victories over Arizona and Arizona State on Oct. 12 and 14, where she led the Trojans to a .299 hitting percentage. She earned her third honors after the UCLA match and a 3-2 victory over Colorado on Sept. 23. The first two awards came back-to-back in the opening weeks of the season. 
When she’s not busy making people laugh, running USC’s offense and winning awards, Lázaro spends much of her time fulfilling her student-athlete duties in the classroom. She’s used to balancing her academic and volleyball commitments. But she’s noticed that she has to read more in her USC classes than in high school, a new challenge. 
“When I have to read a lot, my eyes just close. So I end up reading nothing,” Lázaro admitted, with a smile and a shrug. 
While her major remains undecided, she doesn’t take her time at USC for granted. Lázaro has opened up since arriving from Spain by making new friends and trying to make the most of her international experience.
“I’m very lucky to be here,” Lázaro said. 
This time, she was completely serious.

Freshman forward Penelope Hocking scored a goal in the team’s 3-2 victory over Washington State on Oct. 13. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
The women’s soccer team is preparing for their final home matches of the regular season, hosting both Oregon State on Thursday and Oregon on Sunday.
The Trojans stand at 12-1-1 this season following their tight victory away at No. 19 Washington State over the weekend. Senior forward Leah Pruitt, sophomore midfielder Tara McKeown and freshman forward Penelope Hocking all found the back of the net to help the Women of Troy claim a 3-2 victory.
McAlpine commended Washington State’s speed on the ball and admitted that the Cougars posed a challenge to the Women of Troy.
In their first game of the week, the Trojans will host Oregon State on Thursday at 3 p.m. With a 2-12 record, the Beavers are not the most difficult of opponents for the Trojans. However, they did manage a victory against Cal on Oct. 4. Cal proved to be a challenge for the Trojans on Sept. 27, as they needed overtime to beat the Golden Bears.
The Beavers have struggled to score this season, with only 6 goals in 14 games. Redshirt freshman forward McKenzie Weinert, who has scored 2 goals, will be a key player against USC. The defense does not appear much better, as it has conceded 34 goals this season.
On Sunday, USC will host Oregon at 1 p.m. The Ducks have a 7-6-1 record on the season. They’ve had impressive results and close games against quality opponents, taking Stanford to overtime on Oct. 4 but falling short of the win. However, the Ducks have lost their past five games, including a 4-1 home loss to Colorado on Oct. 13. 
The Ducks have scored 16 goals and conceded 15 this year. Six of those goals came through senior forward Marissa Everett. However, freshman forward Zoe Hasenauer is a creative outlet with four assists on the season.
The Trojans did not let their loss to Stanford earlier in the season  dent their spirits. They have won all three games following their defeat to the Cardinal and have managed to score at least two times in each of those games.
Hocking will be the player to watch this weekend. The freshman has been impressive all season in her role of coming off the bench. She has scored seven times this year with four assists. Her ability to open up defenses with her fast movement and intelligent runs off the ball have helped the Trojans score more goals late in halves. Her hard work was rewarded by finding the net in her last two games.
Defensively, the Trojans have only conceded seven times to date, averaging out to .50 goals against per game this year. While the whole backline has been impressive all season, senior defender Ally Prisock has led the way. Prisock offers an ability unlike other defenders in the Pac-12. 
“When you talk about great teams, you talk about great goalkeepers, great center backs, you talk about your number six and your number nine as being the spine of your team, and Ally by far is the spine of our team,” McAlpine said earlier this year. “But more importantly, she is the competitiveness that we have and the urgency that we play with. [It’s great] when you have that kind of player in there for as long as we have, and being able to be that consistent with starting and playing games and with her performances.”
Winning both of these games would leave the Women of Troy undefeated at home in the regular season.

Junior wide receiver Michael Pittman leads the band after recording 155 yards on six receptions for two touchdowns against Colorado on Saturday. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
The Trojans handed No. 19 Colorado its first loss of the season Saturday, driven by strong performances by the wide receivers and the stifling defense.
“We already knew we were gonna win, playing in the [Coliseum],” junior wide receiver Michael Pittman said. “We don’t lose in the Coli, but we just didn’t know how it was going to happen.” 
They stuck with this confident mentality from the get-go.
“We didn’t really want to look at the ranking, we just looked at it as another game,” Pittman said.
Their upcoming game against Utah on Saturday looks to be another tough matchup, as the Utes are coming off double-digit wins against Stanford and Arizona.
Head coach Clay Helton commended the Utah run game, including junior quarterback Tyler Huntley, who averages 34.5 rushing yards per game.
“They’ve done a great job of getting the ball to [sophomore wide receiver Britain] Covey different ways,” Helton said. “Because of that run game, they’re creating some one-on-one matchups, and they’ve really hit their deep ball shots over the last two games.” 
Senior linebackers Chase Hanson and Cody Barton are impact players on the Utes’ defense, Helton noted.
“As a whole unit, [we want] to give [freshman quarterback JT Daniels] time to throw the ball, so that our guys outside can make some plays,” redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai said.
The backs have been working on pass protection to better protect Daniels and open up the deep ball for other plays that take longer to develop. 
“We play at Utah, so just a road mentality,” Malepeai said. “We want to go there, establish a run game, open up the pass [and] execute as a whole.”
Preparation was key coming into the Colorado game off the bye week, but the mentality for Utah is a bit different. 
“[Utah has] a lot of different schemes that they really go on the fly with, most[ly] on their defense,” Malepeai said. “So we’re not unexpecting what they’re going to do, we just [have to] see it on the field and react [to] it.”
Injury report
Senior linebacker Porter Gustin, who is out for the season with a fractured ankle, had a successful surgery on Monday. Freshman cornerback Olaijah Griffin is out with a shoulder injury. Sophomore defensive lineman Brandon Pili was limited, also with a shoulder injury. Redshirt senior cornerback Jonathan Lockett was out with a hip injury. 
Senior linebacker and team captain Cameron Smith did not practice due to a lingering hamstring injury that kept him out of Saturday’s game. Freshman linebacker Palaie Gaoteote was out with a concussion suffered against Colorado.

With the NBA season underway, it appears that more people have become disinterested with the league, since the Golden State Warriors winning the title is a foregone conclusion.
The Warriors are one of the most impressive NBA teams of all time. When healthy, their likely starting five of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant and now DeMarcus Cousins consists of 25 total All-Star appearances, with at least three for each player. With LeBron James now out of the Eastern Conference, it is debatable that this starting five could beat a team fielded with the five best players from the Eastern Conference. It would be a close contest, but it seems unlikely that anyone will stop this team from its fourth title in five years.  
The cheap acquisition of Cousins, one of the best big men in the game, only made them more dominant than before. While I will never begrudge a team for having a good front office, I will state my frustrations toward the NBA for allowing this to happen.
The Warriors were completely in their rights to sign Cousins and pay him less than his true market value because he was injured. However, it seems illogical that a 28-year-old four-time All-Star is allowed to take a mid-level exception for $5.2 million to fit the salary cap needs of one of the best teams of all-time. The lack of a rule preventing All-Star caliber players from taking less than they are worth defeats the whole purpose of having a salary cap system in the first place, and it allows the rich to get richer. In turn, this makes the NBA less competitive and the championship winner even more of a foregone conclusion. 
With that being said, there are still many storylines in this NBA season that make basketball worth watching. People don’t only watch sports because they want to know who will win. People watch sports for the love of the game and the desire to be entertained, and basketball will still be entertaining this season.
First and foremost, “Showtime” basketball is back in Los Angeles with the start of the “LA-Bron” era. It will be interesting to see how James will deal with the strong Western Conference as opposed to the East. Moreover, James has never played with a young core of players, so it will be interesting to see how his leadership abilities enhance the talents of players like Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma.
With Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving coming back from their respective injuries, and the promising displays of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown in last season’s playoffs, the early summer declared the Boston Celtics as the clear favorites to come out of the Eastern Conference. However, following the Kawhi Leonard trade, the Toronto Raptors can contend for the Eastern Conference, and Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid’s Philadelphia 76ers also shouldn’t be overlooked.
Jimmy Butler has caused a lot of stir in Minnesota recently. The Olympic gold medalist has been outspoken about his disapproval of the NBA. After a lot of speculation over the past few weeks, it seems like he will stay in Minnesota for the season; however, it will be interesting to see how his locker room responds to his actions. It was reported that Butler held a “players only” meeting to voice his frustration to his teammates. He believes the team needs to play with more passion and commitment. The Timberwolves finished eighth in the West last season, but Butler only played 59 games due to injury. On paper, the Timberwolves have one of the most talented rosters in the NBA with Butler, Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins, so there should be high expectations for this season. 
For USC fans, the prospect of watching former Trojans like De’Anthony Melton, (Phoenix Suns) and Chimezie Metu (San Antonio Spurs) take the court for the first time will be fun to follow. Trojan fans did not get to see much of Melton last season, as the University suspended him indefinitely following the fraud and corruption charges against former USC assistant coach Tony Bland. Metu, on the other hand, was First Team All-Pac-12 last season averaging over 15 points a game. Following the leadership of coach Gregg Popovich, Metu will look to take his game to the next level as he enters the NBA.
Fans shouldn’t be discouraged from watching the NBA this season just because it seems inevitable that the Warriors will win. As with all sports, the winner isn’t always the best or the most interesting storyline.

On Monday, Capitol Records hosted an album release party and music video shoot for Migos’ Quavo. “Quavo Huncho” is the Atlanta rapper’s first solo project. (Matthew Philips | Daily Trojan)
To celebrate last Friday’s release of “Quavo Huncho” from Migos’ own Quavo, Capitol Records hosted an album release party and music video shoot at its Hollywood office on Monday. 
The album, which features artists such as Normani, Travis Scott, Drake and Cardi B, is Quavo’s first solo effort since Migos burst onto the scene with “Versace” in 2013. Since then, the trio has been on a tear with Billboard-topping singles like “Bad and Boujee,” “Fight Night” and “Walk It Talk It.” 
“Quavo Huncho” is Quavo’s first real test as an artist without the assistance of Takeoff and Offset, (excluding “KEEP THAT SHIT” and “FUCK 12,” on which each rapper has one verse, respectively). Some critics have said that the album is a reflection of Quavo’s strengths, as well as proof that the group is greater than the sum of its parts. But at Monday’s event, Quavo flashed the personality and charisma that sets him apart from the rest of Migos.
For the first portion of the event, Capitol Records led actors and media members to a mock press conference complete with a podium for Quavo and a curtained backdrop covered in “Quavo Huncho” tags. There, the production team encouraged the mixed group of reporters and actors to take part in Quavo’s video for “How Bout That?” 
The video’s concept revolves around a basketball game following the press event. In this particular scene, Quavo addresses the media on behalf of his team. The group acting as the press animatedly begs Quavo to answer their scripted questions, which were more fitting for an NBA player than the Atlanta-based rapper. Quavo’s responses were comedic, littered with ad-libs and typical Migos slang like “drip” and “gang.”  
Quavo himself was a bit more impatient during the video shoot, but it was more a product of his demand for professionalism. He ensured that his seat and podium were perfectly centered with the camera and reporters, and he demanded that the reporters commit to their performance as much as he did. He delivered his lines with a certain self-awareness and sense of humor that fit his image within the Migos brand.
The album release party also featured a basketball game comprising streetball players and some of Quavo’s friends. Quavo appeared shortly after warm-ups. He took pictures with fans and posed with a crew member dressed in a bodysuit that resembled the trap artist and included a foam recreation of his signature dreadlocks. For the most part, fans enjoyed a pick-up game with a strong mixture of musical talent and athleticism on a shortened court. 
Capitol Records even enlisted a DJ and master of ceremonies to host the event and entertain the crowd gathered around the court. The players’ names were not listed nor displayed on their jerseys, so the host took liberty in giving them playful nicknames. During the game, the DJ blasted hit tracks from “Quavo Huncho.” Quavo’s label “Quality Control” and the “Quavo Huncho” tags also decorated the surface of the court.
Even with the release of his debut full-length album, Quavo has not indicated any plans to embark on a solo tour. Migos is currently opening for Drake on his “Aubrey & The Three Migos” tour, with no break until the end of the tour in November. Until then, fans and industry veterans alike can only speculate over what’s next for the Grammy-nominated trap trio and for Quavo’s burgeoning solo career.

October is my favorite month for a slew of reasons — miniature pumpkins, sweater weather, my birthday — but Halloween is not one of them. As a big ol’ scaredy cat, I like to keep my distance from horror in any medium, be it books, movies or theme parks. So when I picked up Alexandra Kleeman’s “You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine,” I did not expect to put it down with a growing sense of unease gnawing at my stomach. 
At first blush, “You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine” seems your standard postmodern Pynchonian novel. The protagonist, known only as A, lives with a roommate, B, and has a boyfriend, C. They live in an unnamed American city, on a quiet residential street dotted with manicured lawns and lined with oaks and maples. A works as a proofreader for a company that produces magazines and newsletters. To pass time, thick with summer’s blistering heat, A and B sit outside and lap up a panoply of tropical-colored popsicles. 
But something’s not quite right. Upon closer inspection, the standard trappings that accompany white-collar suburbia, the placid cookie cutter houses and big box grocery stores and tedious pablum on TV reveal themselves, like stage props, to be fake and contrived, in service to some murky conspiracy where a shadow organization pulls the strings.
First, there’s Wally’s Supermarket. Wally’s operates under an unconventional organizing principle in that every few weeks the store layout rearranges itself and the items rotate positions. The employee uniform is an enormous foam head of Wally, the store’s teenage mascot, and if you approach it asking for help, they are not allowed to direct you to the milk; instead, they offer a form of generalized aid, in which you describe your “product circumstances” and they suggest alternatives vaguely tangential to what you seek.
The Wally’s shopping experience is designed to obscure, to baffle, so that bemused shoppers are forced to wander the aisles in hopes of stumbling upon what they are looking for, and in the meantime, grab an item or two that they weren’t. Wally’s customers average an impressive 22-percent increase in unforeseen purchases.  
On TV, the most popular show on air is a reality dating series called “That’s My Partner!” One member of a couple must jump through elaborate hoops to identify their significant other concealed in a lineup, both burdened with the knowledge that if the competing partner fails, they must contractually separate and impose a restraining order on each other. During breaks, ominous commercials: A woman peels her face off — over and over — until a beautiful, famous actress is revealed; a dove forces its way down a woman’s throat so she can be beautiful and radiant from the inside. The most frequent ones, however, are for Kandy Kakes, in which an emaciated Kandy Kat chases after the freewheeling, ever-elusive Kakes in a series of increasingly desperate scenarios reminiscent of the Trix rabbit. 
And then weird shit starts happening. A witnesses the nice normal family across the street — a mom, a dad, a daughter who does ballet — suddenly abandon their house in broad daylight, all while draped in white bed sheets with cut-out eye holes, like they forgot Halloween was tomorrow. Fathers begin vanishing from their middle-class lives only to reappear months later, living the exact same life with a similar set of wife and kids and a curious case of amnesia, a phenomenon that newscasters dub Disappearing Dad Disorder. B cuts her hair and presents the lopped-off braid to A, who suspects that B, to whom she already bears an eerie resemblance, is trying to steal her identity. When A confides in C, C blithely gaslights her, his bland, reassuring demeanor and ability to rationalize the most irrational situations only heightening her disquietude. 
I don’t want to spoil the book, but once Kleeman completes world-building and gets the ball rolling, A’s deteriorating mental state leads her on a wild goose chase involving Kandy Kakes, “That’s My Partner!” and a mysterious cult called the Church of the Conjoined Eater. Stories exploring suburbia as a vehicle for consumption, conformity and commodification are nothing new, but Kleeman imbues familiar territory with a sinister air, so that I have second thoughts about stepping into the local Ralphs. There may not be monsters or demons in “You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine,” but rest assured, A’s world contains something far, far more foreboding.

On Sept. 8, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill that will ban for-profit charter schools in the state of California. While this seems like a step in the right direction, the bill will make little difference and covers up greater problems about charter schools, such as their lack of racial and socioeconomic diversity.
Brown has been a staunch advocate of charter schools, previously avoiding the issue of charter school regulation. California has a reputation as the “Wild West” of privatized education, with the number of charter schools consistently growing even as they were wracked with scandal. Brown’s position as a charter school advocate — he opened two during his time as mayor of Oakland — has caused some to be confused by his decision to break the pattern and sign this supposedly restrictive bill. Upon a closer look at AB 406, however, it is evident that the measure is an ineffective piece of legislation that will do little more than distract from the underlying issues facing the charter school system, such as racial segregation in the charter system.
California has more charter schools than any other state. Overall, its 1,275 charter schools enroll around 630,000 students, according to the California Charter Schools Association. Of this, 35 of the charter schools, serving approximately 25,000 students, are run by five private companies. Although these for-profit companies are the targets of the bill, little operational change can be expected. The bill will not go into effect until July 2019, and gives for-profit schools a five-year grace period to submit their charter for review, re-categorize themselves as nonprofits or create new corporate identities every five years to avoid regulation. It will likely not have any immediate implications on these targeted institutions, as reported in The Washington Post.
Often, charter schools are supported by parents because people perceive them as institutions of educational choice, flexibility and innovation. They are essentially privatized public schools — they receive taxpayer money, but are exempt from many of the rules and regulations that govern traditional public schools. The result of this flexible contract not only allows the schools to make quicker, experimental changes, but also results in opportunistic investors with no educational experience using charter schools to make a quick buck, and charter schools becoming unintentionally segregated.
In December 2017, an Associated Press analysis of nationwide charter school enrollment found that these schools were some of the most racially segregated in the nation. Though they  are technically open to all students who are interested, and sometimes admit students through a lottery system, the racial makeup of the schools end up skewed. Seventeen percent of charter schools had student bodies consisting of 99 percent minority students, compared to 4 percent of traditional public schools in the 2014-15 academic year, according to the National Education Association. Of the 6,747 charter schools nationwide, that is more than 1,000 schools with minority enrollments of at least 99 percent.
Although these schools were intended to help equalize education, minority students have simply been resegregated in charter schools. This is because charter schools tend to be located in inner cities, which is a noble choice for the founders, but is concerning because it means that a large portion of children in America may be learning at institutions that are unregulated and provide subpar education.
High levels of segregation are inextricably linked to wide gaps in educational opportunities. As the AP report states, “levels of segregation correspond with low achievement levels at schools of all kinds.” Educational and life disadvantages and limited opportunities are consistently connected to segregated schools.
Racial segregation in public schools is inherently unconstitutional and unjust.  Since charters are publicly funded, they must adhere to public standards and be regulated to avoid segregation.
While charter schools are not entirely responsible for the issue, their claims that they have no business to deal with segregation is erroneous. By saying it is “unfair to put the burden on charters to pursue integration,” charter schools exempt themselves from getting to the real source of inequity. Since the charter school system and diversity can coexist, there is no need to stifle progress and refuse to make changes.
Charter schools must have greater oversight. They need to restore and enforce diversifying methods such as free transportation, outreach and diversity goals. It is crucial that states strengthen the civil rights and equity policies for their charter schools.
The bill signed by Brown is merely a Band-Aid solution to a much larger wound. To fix the extreme segregation in charter schools, government and charter school leaders must work to create more stringent regulations  of the charter system, as charter schools cannot continue to perpetuate segregation.

In the wake of the notorious 1992 Anita Hill hearings, which saw a black woman shoulder frustrating sexism upon testifying about her experiences with sexual harassment, a wave of then-unprecedented numbers of American women ran for office and won. So far in 2018, there has been a 60-percent increase in the number of women planning to run for Congress compared to the 2016 race, according to Politico. And many of these female candidates have found success: In August, The New York Times reported that a record-high 200 female candidates had won their primaries for the House of Representatives. White men comprise a minority of the House Democratic nominees for the first time in history.
Just last week, a statistic by the Reflective Democracy Campaign revealed a 75-percent increase in women of color running for office since 2012. These numbers are a sharp challenge to the status quo; currently, white men hold 65 percent of all local, state and federal offices. White men make up just 32 percent of the U.S. population.
Now more than ever, voters must recognize the critical nature of electing more women, and specifically more women of color, particularly in light of recent divides between white women voters and women of color.
All Americans benefit when women, in general, hold more offices. Research by Michele Swers, a political scientist at Georgetown University, shows that women legislators in Congress have historically introduced and passed almost double the legislation of their male counterparts, focused on oft-neglected domestic issues like health care and education, and have been more likely to work across party lines.
Feminism is driven by solidarity among women and marginalized groups; the movement seeks to uplift all people who are oppressed by the white, cisgender, heterosexual patriarchy. With that said, here are some difficult truths: 53 percent of white women voted for President Donald Trump in 2016. Just 46 percent of white women believed the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her, compared to 83 and 66 percent of black and Latinas, respectively, according to Quinnipiac University polling. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was one of the deciding votes to confirm Kavanaugh to the high court, despite the numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against him. The voting public must examine why so many white women act against their own interests to uphold the Trump administration’s agenda of misogyny.
The intersectional war on women that disparately attacks women of color, people of color, immigrants and LGBTQ people, is ultimately facilitated by powerful, wealthy, straight white men. There is no erasing their active, unrelenting attacks on women’s rights, and their creation and maintenance of a culture that erases and trivializes sexual violence and empowers accused men as victims. However, to stand up to this all-encompassing system of oppression requires the labor and solidarity of all women. For too long, throughout history and today, not enough white women have been willing to yield the privileges conferred upon them by whiteness to stand up for others.
Voting for Trump, and voting in line with Trump, ultimately empowers male abusers, forfeits women’s bodily autonomy and supports a system that strips women of credibility and  hurts them regardless of their race. But for white women who are able to reap some of the benefits of the white, cis-hetero patriarchy, systems of oppression may seem worth maintaining. The wives of men like Trump, Kavanaugh and Vice President Mike Pence and other white women connected to powerful white men aren’t affected by patriarchal oppression in the same way women of color are, and additionally, they are unwilling to give up the social capital they gain from those relationships.
Let’s not forget how women of color are more likely to seek abortion care, or how black women are disproportionately affected by the United States’ crisis in maternal health care, and are 243 percent more likely than white women to die of pregnancy and birth-related causes. Let’s not forget how Native American women are more likely than all other women to experience sexual violence, or how the wage gap expands from $0.86 on the dollar for white women, to $0.63 and $0.54 for black and Latinx women, respectively.
Of course, women of color are not a monolith. We all have different perspectives, experiences and different policy preferences. It’s not our obligation to save the world, and bear the burden of decades of cruel, harmful policies from bigoted white men. But certainly, we deserve a seat at the table and determinism in the decisions being made about our bodies and our lives. Certainly, it’s fair to say the legislative decisions of women of color may be impacted by their lived experiences, which are often unique of white women and men.
This November, with more women of color candidates than ever, we have a chance to make real change, not just for some people, and not just for some women — but also for everyone.

The Undergraduate Student Government held a committee meeting Tuesday to discuss a potential amendment to a $50,000 diversity fund. 
The fund, which was created to provide funding for events that would promote diversity on campus, has undergone a process to create an amendment that would make it more accessible to cultural assemblies at USC. 
The first topic of discussion Tuesday concerned whether the senate should have the ability to veto a fund request that has already been granted. Senator Michaela Murphy, the co-chair of the diversity fund committee, explained that there is no precedent for USG senate vetoes in other USG funds.
“I don’t think it’s fair to make it seem like we don’t trust the discretion of the people who would be sitting on this oversight board when we haven’t given senate this discretion on any other fund in the past,” Murphy said. 
Senator Meagan Lane said that in light of the Ben Shapiro event last week, there should be more checks to how certain events receive funding when they could potentially present harm to students.
However, she explained that the diversity fund would not endorse any kind of event that would risk people’s safety and well-being. She said that any complaints against the use of the diversity fund would come from outside of the senate, not from anyone within USG. 
Speaker Pro Tempore Matthew Crane said he was concerned that denying funding to certain groups could lead to lawsuits from certain organizations. However, several cultural assembly representatives said that they have never witnessed such lawsuits at USC.
Co-chief Diversity Director Shaghayegh Ebadi said that because of the makeup of the fund’s oversight board — which includes the USG treasurer, the chief diversity officers and a representative from each cultural assembly — it would be unlikely for the diversity fund to pay for anything that would harm students. 
“You have the most qualified, the most impacted communities that should know what’s good for them [and] should know what’s going to be of value to that community,” Ebadi said.
Murphy echoed this sentiment, saying that the oversight board is not at risk of funding anything problematic.
“The clear and most present and most explicit and most important stakeholders for conversations like these, for funding applications for different marginalized communities are not only present at the very beginning, but they are empowered at the very beginning,” Murphy said. “A senate veto is paternalistic … I don’t think that it’s important.”
The second part of the meeting delved into whether or not the language of the amendment should set $50,000 as a floor for the fund.
“Do we [as USG] want to get roped into funding things that admin should be paying for themselves, but now have an excuse not to fund them?” Murphy said. 
Murphy said that if USG puts its own money toward promoting diversity, the administration will follow their lead. She said that because the administration is not funding certain diversity-based initiatives already, it is up to USG to start a trend with the hope that the administration will follow suit.
“If we use the belief system that … where we put our money is a reflection of our values, then that is a very strong statement to make to the USC administration to say that what we value is diversity-based initiatives,” Murphy said.

Faith Florez was inspired to develop an app that alerts farmworkers of high temperatures, among other dangers in the fields, after her great-grandmother developed pancreatic cancer and died from pesticides and heat overexposure. (Photo courtesy of Faith Florez)
Growing up in the Central Valley, freshman Faith Florez was raised by immigrant family members who worked on farms. After her great-grandmother, a former farmworker, developed pancreatic cancer and died from pesticides and heat overexposure, Florez was inspired to take matters into her own hands. 
“I think realizing the privilege and opportunity I have now, I see an obligation to go back into my community even though I moved to Los Angeles, and do what I can to help individuals [in the Central Valley],” Florez said.
From that obligation, she created the iOS app Calor, which was featured this month. 
The app notifies farmworkers when field temperatures exceed 95 degrees, alerting them to take legally mandated breaks for water and shade. It also provides tips on what workers should wear, eat and drink based on weather data and individualized medical information. 
In addition, the app hosts short articles and videos to educate farmworkers about their legal rights and ensures their safety and health along with functions like an emergency 911 hotline in conjunction with Apple’s SOS function. 
The project began during Florez’s sophomore year of high school, when she approached Viterbi School of Engineering professor Supannika Koolmanojwong  in a software engineering class where Florez wrote the concept for her application. 
“With 90,000 farms in California, Calor’s main motivation is to change from ‘work or health’ to ‘work and health,’” Koolmanojwong Mobasser told USC News. 
Florez commuted to Viterbi two to three times a month to develop Calor with Koolmanojwong in a class on real-life software development projects. With the guidance of professor Barry Boehm, Florez worked out which functions to prioritize, which services to choose for the weather and notification functions to use in order to make the system more accessible to farmworkers. 
“It was really interesting because I didn’t really know anyone there, but the group that I worked with. They’re a really great group of guys, really smart and really effective and productive,” Florez said. “It was a great time working with them.”
Florez has fundraised over $60,000 to cover development costs. She has also been applying for grants and scholarships to fund more Apple Watches for farmworkers. The app is now also expanding to the watch brand Fitbit because it is less expensive than the Apple Watch. 
Florez hopes to continue improving the app, and her team is working on adding emergency outline functions that track workers’ locations.
“We’ll kind of adjust the app based off of more pilots that we do and more feedback that we get from farmers and farmworkers,” Florez said. 
Florez hopes to expand Calor and make it a standardized tool for farmworkers everywhere.
“It’s really cool that this is being featured [by Apple],” Florez said. “A lot of the time when we talk about the future, everyone’s driving a flying car or having their own personal robot. If we have these really big visions of the future, why can’t an agricultural worker have wearable technology like an Apple Watch that already exists?”

Adjunct professor La Mikia Castillo said it can be hard to find a space where she “fits in,” due to her Afro-Latina identity. Castillo works to bridge her two communities, since she thinks members of both face similar issues. (Sarah Johnson| Daily Trojan)
Born and raised in South L.A., alumna and adjunct professor La Mikia Castillo strives to make a difference in communities in need by focusing on public policy and urban planning.
“I grew up in a low-income community,” Castillo said. “It wasn’t until that I got to college when I realized that my community didn’t have access to the same resources as other communities.”
Castillo received her bachelor’s degree from UC San Diego, where she said she noticed a stark contrast in access to resources among her peers.
“When I began to see the disparities between what I had access to and what my friends from home had access to versus my peers in college, I realized that there was something wrong there and I wanted to change it,” she said. 
In college, Castillo learned that communities looked the way they do due to policies implemented by policymakers and urban planners, who decide which areas certain populations will be placed in. 
“I became a community organizer because I really wanted to work on organizing community members to learn what I had learned in college and use that information to change the community, to actually advocate for policies that would be positive for us,” Castillo said.
As a graduate student at the Price School of Public Policy, Castillo founded the Black Student Association at Price after noticing that there was a need for black students to speak about issues that impact the black community. In addition, she was a board member of the Latino Student Association at Price.
“[These groups] were very meaningful for me because as a person who identifies as black and Latina, sometimes it’s hard to find the space where I feel like I fit in, where I can be my whole self,” Castillo said. “I’ve always been involved in black student organizations and Latinx student organizations and then act as a bridge between them because I think that issues our communities face are so similar, that it makes sense for us to overlap and work together to address them through policy and planning,” 
Castillo recently worked as a national director at the National Foster Institute, where she worked on local, state and federal child welfare policies. She also helped empower foster youth by helping them understand how policy is created.  
“I would bring foster youth from across the country to Washington D.C. to meet with their Congress members,” Castillo said. “They would shadow them to learn about how Congress works, and they would then tell their own personal stories about what their experiences were like in the foster care system … They would also make recommendations for how they can address those challenges through policy.” 
Currently, Castillo teaches both of Price’s undergraduate social innovation and graduate social context courses at Price. In both classes, Castillo allows students to work together to solve challenges through social innovations and hands-on activities. 
“I know that there’s so much for [students] to contribute to the class, so if you would like to lead a session in the class, I want you to take the lead on that,” Castillo said. “I absolutely love when students take that opportunity to lead, and I think it helps them feel empowered that you have something to bring and something to offer, and your peers can learn from you as well.”
This story is part of a mini-series highlighting Latinos at USC. It ran every week during Hispanic Heritage Month, which ended Oct. 15.

Former state legislator Sebastian Ridley-Thomas filed a complaint against USC to the U.S. Department of Education alleging student right violations, according to documents obtained by the Daily Trojan.
The complaint, which was filed in late September, comes after Ridley-Thomas accused USC of disclosing confidential student data to the Los Angeles Times. Some of the data disclosed included the legislator’s status as a student and information about his hiring as a professor and his scholarship for a master’s degree at the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work.
“Since we have no way of knowing if USC questioned the persons who knew about the scholarship or took other steps to learn the source of the disclosure, we will rely on the federal authorities at the Department of Education to investigate this issue,” Porter Scott, Ridley-Thomas’ attorney, wrote in a letter to University Counsel Dawn Kennedy on Oct. 5.
USC denied the allegations in a letter to Scott on Oct. 2, explaining that “any individuals authorized to speak on behalf of the University … would not have shared information in violation of [the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act].” 
The act, commonly referred to as FERPA, states that schools receiving federal funding “must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student’s education record.” 
The law also suggests that schools have permission to disclose, without consent, directory information such as student names, addresses, honors and awards, but that they must also provide a “reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them.”
Kennedy informed Scott and Ridley-Thomas on Oct. 2 that his complaints were reviewed by the Office of Student Affairs, and that the office determined that “these matters do not fall within the scope of the student grievance process” denoted under the University’s Student Conduct Code.
In August, Lance Olson, one of Ridley-Thomas’ attorneys, wrote to the University that he was concerned that the Los Angeles Times was informed of a confidential interview prior to Ridley-Thomas’ hiring.
“That information could only have come from one of the three persons from USC who participated in the interview,” he wrote.
Ridley-Thomas’ complaint to the Department of Education comes after stories from the Times about the former legislator’s resignation from the state Assembly. The Daily Trojan also published a story last month that suggested that administrators at the School of Social Work were aware of Ridley-Thomas’ status as a student when he was hired as a faculty member — a conflict that led to his firing.
“Like all other new students and people who are offered employment, Mr. Ridley-Thomas relied on the deans and academic administrators at USC to know and follow the university’s rules,” Olson wrote in a September email to the Daily Trojan. “Naturally, he believed that everything was in order.”
In early August, the Times reported that Ridley-Thomas joined the School of Social Work faculty while pursuing his master’s degree under a full-tuition scholarship.
During this time, the Times reported that his father, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, made a $100,000 donation from his campaign fund to the School of Social Work, which was later funneled to a think tank unaffiliated with USC and led by Sebastian Ridley-Thomas.
“We do not believe that it raises any legal or ethical issues, and it had nothing to do with his son’s scholarship or employment at the University,” Mark Ridley-Thomas’ attorney said in a statement to the Daily Trojan in August.
Following the disclosure of this transaction, USC put former School of Social Work dean Marilyn Flynn on leave, fired Sebastian Ridley-Thomas and forwarded the details about the donation to a federal agency.
Sebastian Ridley-Thomas’ attorneys denied any connection between the donation from Mark Ridley-Thomas and Sebastian’s enrollment and employment at the University.
