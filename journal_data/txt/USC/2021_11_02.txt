Students, parents and non-USC anti-Greek life activists gathered  Monday at the Sigma Nu fraternity to advocate for the abolition of Greek life at USC. Under a boom microphone and the harsh lighting of video cameras, participants took turns offering their experiences and opinions on Greek life’s effect on university culture, while men in passing cars yelled expletives and heckled the crowd. 
Leila Hilf, a sophomore majoring in film and television production, organized the protest by posting her plans on social media before she was contacted by Greek life abolition organizations and parent activists.
A documentary crew was present at the protest, part of a two-year project by parents of children who died from hazing-related incidents. They expressed their desire for reform within the Greek system. Among them was Gary DeVercelly, who lost his son Gary Jr. in 2007 to alcohol poisoning in a fraternity hazing ritual at Rider University.
“Dealing with that devastation in our lives, we decided that we wanted to help prevent this from ever happening again,” DeVercelly said. 
Others did not believe reform was an option, and voiced their support for completely removing Greek life from USC. A freshman majoring in public policy at the event said that the entire system should be abolished.
“At the core of a lot of these institutions is decades of racism, decades of classism, decades of violence, decades of fear mongering, decades of toxic masculinity,” they said. “It’s almost cult-like … I just don’t think that there is a solution that is progressive, that any organization on this row or any organization in this country will understand.” 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, the student said that the issue transcends sexual assault.
“This is about years of festering ignorance becoming something that is unavoidable and something that we cannot ignore,” they said. “This is about getting rid of it all.”
The sororities involved are also complicit, the student said. 
“It’s hard to separate sorority girls, when they live right across the street,” they said. “There needs to be accountability and there needs to be an understanding that this entire system has been built on the backs of ugly, ugly things.”
After students finished speaking, the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority house, opposite Sigma Nu, opened its doors and two members spoke to the crowd with security guards stationed on the front steps. The members shared their opinions on abolition, telling the crowd that not all Greek life members are wealthy and that sexual assault frequently occurs outside of fraternities. The exchange became heated, and the members went back inside the house with one of the parent activists, saying they had a meeting to attend.

This week’s edition features my takes on why Carmelo Anthony is the front-runner for sixth man of the year, why Brady remains the NFL’s best player and why Saturday wasn’t the right time for USC to try out its two-quarterback system.
Carmelo Anthony makes his case for Sixth Man of the Year
After an 0-2 start with their shiny new big three of LeBron James, Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis that had fans panicking, the Los Angeles Lakers are cooking as they’ve won four of their last five games. However, people may have to start acknowledging that the Lakers have a Big Four as future-hall-of-famer Carmelo Anthony is making a legitimate case for Sixth Man of the Year.
The NBA’s ninth all-time leading scorer has been criticized for a lack of efficiency and inability to adapt to the modern game. However, Melo has evolved into one of the most elite catch-and-shoot players in the NBA as he is shooting 50% from the field, 52.2% from three and averages 16.7 points a game this season —  his highest total since he was an All Star with the New York Knicks in 2017.
On Friday, Melo dropped 24 points on 9-of-12 shooting as he once again went 6-of-8 from three, this time on the 18th anniversary of his NBA debut. Melo closed off his incredible resurgence this week with 23 points in 25 minutes while making 5 three-pointers on Sunday. What was most notable on Sunday is that Melo, once again, proved the haters wrong as the often-criticized defender was a menace with 4 blocks and 2 steals.
The block party tied Melo’s career-high in blocks. As it stands right now, 37-year-old Carmelo Anthony is clearly the most deserving player in the NBA for the Sixth Man of the Year award.
Tom Brady proves he’s still the NFL’s best quarterback
44-year-old quarterback Tom Brady already has more Lombardi Trophies than any NFL franchise with seven Super Bowl wins. However, he simply won’t stop as he’s now out-playing young quarterbacks that grew up watching him win Super Bowl’s in the early 2000s while remaining this year’s favorite to win it all.
Brady’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers may have lost to the New Orleans Saints this weekend, but they’re still 6-2 after demolishing the Chicago Bears 38-3 last weekend in a blowout win. The Bucs blew out the Bears by so much that Brady sat most of the fourth quarter and still threw for four touchdowns.
Brady may have thrown an uncharacteristic costly interception against the Saints, but before that play he had 375 yards and four touchdowns. The 22-year veteran is still clearly the best player in the NFL as he leads the league with 2650 passing yards and 25 touchdowns.
The scariest part about this is that Brady may be having the best season of his career so it’s impossible to know when he’ll slow down. Brady is throwing the deep ball and spreading the ball to multiple receivers even though he has his best receiver since Randy Moss in 2007: Mike Evans.
Brady’s best season to date was when threw for 4,806 yards and 50 touchdowns as he led the New England Patriots to the NFL’s first 16-0 record in 2007. Brady is on pace to surpass both totals with the NFL’s new 17-game schedule.
This comes nearly 15 years after his best season. Even the haters should enjoy watching this unprecedented greatness from Brady as we may never see anything like it again.
USC deploys bold two-quarterback system
Fans have been enamored with freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart ever since he had the greatest debut by a quarterback in USC football history throwing for a record 391 yards. However, a knee injury prevented him from playing since his debut game Sept. 18, that was until the second quarter of the Arizona game Sunday after junior starting quarterback Kedon Slovis put up arguably the best first quarter of his three-season career.
Slovis had thrown for nearly 145 yards and a touchdown while completing 9-of-11 passes before Dart came in. Fans were thrilled and the seemingly lifeless Trojan crowd was injected with energy, but fans and pundits alike still question whether interim Head Coach Donte Williams should have let Slovis play in this instance.
Dart is evidently the team’s future, and it could even be wise to start him over Slovis going forward, but this two-quarterback system could be confusing for both players. It’s a bold decision by Williams, which makes sense as he’s trying to prove why his interim title should only be temporary.
With the devastating injury to junior receiver Drake London, arguably the nation’s best receiver, overshadowing the win against the lowly 0-8 Arizona Wildcats, making it only more apparent that the Trojans need to look toward the future. Dart will be an exciting quarterback for USC, but he deserves to have his own games as does Slovis — at least until Dart is announced as the starter.
At this point, the Trojans need a cultural reset involving a coach such as Eric Bieniemy, the Southern California native currently coordinating the struggling offense of the Kansas City Chiefs, not a two-quarterback system. With that said, Williams deserves credit for managing a tough situation and making a bold choice, but it may not be enough to remove the interim title unless the Trojans can perform against better teams.

USC was defeated by No. 12 Washington and No. 21 Washington State at the Galen Center this weekend. The Trojans now have an overall record of 10-11 and a conference record of 6-6.
The Trojans took on Washington Friday, who currently stands with an overall record of 16-4 and a conference record of 9-3.  In their last meeting, the Huskies came out on top at home by a score of 3-1. Washington bested the Trojans again (28-26, 28-26, 19-25, 25-23). The first two sets continued past regulation score with the Huskies winning both.
Sunday saw USC face a 14-8 (8-4) Washington State team. The last time the two teams met, the Trojans took a 3-1 away win over the Cougars.
“I think they were well prepared,” Head Coach Brad Keller said. “They were ready to go. I think they were shocked when we went over there and beat them, and they definitely wanted to get revenge. They wanted this one pretty bad.”
The Trojans made costly mistakes that allowed Washington State to jump ahead. Starting the first set with three errors at the net and service reception, USC allowed the Cougars to gain momentum. USC also faced trouble on the offensive end as it had a hitting percentage of .077, compared to Washington State’s .271. Washington State claimed the match with a score of 3-0 (25-21, 25-23, 25-14).
“We were off from point one, and we never, ever found rhythm,” Keller said. “Everything wasn’t working … We were scattered the entire match. We were trying to figure out how to regain a bit of rhythm and figure out how to work through that problem. We just never could get it going.”
USC will focus on limiting its unforced errors moving forward. Against Washington, the Trojans had a total of 15 service errors, points that can easily determine a match’s outcome. 
“We [made] a lot of unforced errors, and we [made] tentative plays as the match [went] on,” Keller said. “We have to be more aggressive, be more assertive in how we play at the end of games. I think that is something that is very doable for us. I think we can correct that.”
This coming weekend, the Trojans will be back on the road as they travel to Colorado and Utah in their second matchups this season. USC plays Colorado Friday at 6 p.m. and Utah at 11 a.m. Sunday.

The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities awarded USC and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles a $24.5 million grant last month to establish a center focusing on health disparities in the Southern California Latinx community.
The Southern California Center for Chronic Health Disparities in Latino Children and Families is one of 11 NIMHD funded initiatives for research in Chronic Disease Prevention and Treatment in underserved communities and will involve a coalition of research and community-based institutions across Southern California, such as Kaiser Permanente, UC San Diego, Southern California Clinical and Translational Science Institute and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
Michael Goran, professor of pediatrics at USC Keck School of Medicine, said one of the center’s projects he founded was to better understand dietary issues and nutrition intervention required in the Latinx population. The center will address disparities in obesity, Type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and dyslipidemia in Southern California Latinx families, who represent almost half of the area’s population.
While researching childhood nutrition at USC for 20 years, Goran, who is also the director for diabetes and obesity at the Saban Research Institute at CHLA, found that Latinx are more likely to develop obesity at younger ages and submitted a proposal for the center to the NIMHD in mid-June. Since beginning operations in early-October, Goran said the center has received calls from Latinx organizations.
“Most research on how to address this problem is done among non-Latino populations, so, clearly, we need to work more closely with the Latino community to develop strategies that will be more effective,” Goran said. “Latinos have a huge disparity in terms of risk for the major chronic diseases that are shortening lives and costing healthcare dollars but yet, there’s not enough research in that community to help mitigate those problems.”
Goran and his co-director, Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, hope to address the Latinx community’s diverse needs and disparities in Southern California during the five years the center will be funded, with a chance to renew funding.
“Our work is to really encompass the entire Latino population and be able to understand unique issues in these different groups,” said Baezconde-Garbanati, professor of preventive medicine and co-lead of community outreach core at the center. “It’s a very unique center and it has such a broad geographic spread in the entire region, that we think it can really make a difference in terms of really impacting disparities at that level.”
Baezconde-Garbanati said it is important to take different perspectives into account when working with the Latinx community, such as acknowledging that many Latinx are from various parts of Latin America.
She also said the center plans to take cultural sensitivity into account, writing educational material directly in Spanish without translating it from English first to understand the uniqueness and the cultural nuances that may be needed. 
Baezconde-Garbanati said many obesity-related health disparities became even more prevalent during the pandemic. The lack of nutritious food and physical activity in the community led the researchers to believe they needed to intervene. To combat the rise of obesity-related health disparities that occurred during the pandemic, the center will work with its partners to offer telehealth nutrition counseling to Latinx families. The center also plans to spread information and research findings through its “promotores de salud,” or community health workers.
“What we hope to accomplish is to really improve the health of the Latino population in Southern California, to really reduce disparities, and to be able to impact the chronic disease burden that has suffered in these communities,” Baezconde-Garbanati said. “We’re hoping that that will be a place where we can make an impact.”
Kayla de la Haye, associate professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine and co-lead of investigator development at the center, said the center’s work is important because the first years of children’s lives are “so critical,” but many are not given treatment or intervention until already diagnosed. By then, it is difficult to reverse health outcomes, she said.
“If you can work with the whole family system to change the environment and change some intergenerational patterns that might have happened, you set these kids at a whole different trajectory, increasing their ability to have healthy options, and healthy eating and activity. I just think that that’s such a crucial shift,” de la Haye said.

I was talking with my cousin over boba the other day when she proceeded to tell me about a trend taking over TikTok. I avoid the app like the plague so this is a more common occurrence than I would like to admit. I just know that the second the app appears on my home screen, I’d be hooked. (Though, I am tempted everyday by “BookTok,” but more on that later.)
Nevertheless, on this particular day, she told me about the “Berries and Cream” trend. It features a song from a 2007 Starburst commercial that found its way to TikTok and has people dancing and donning bowl cuts similar to the commercial. 
My cousin showed me remixes that included snakes singing the song and I said she ought to be proud! My TikTok knowledge also included Walker Hayes’ “Fancy Like.” But, the second she showed me that first video of “Berries and Cream” remixes, I knew I had to write about songs in books. 
I’ve often felt that sharing your Spotify (or Apple Music, who am I to judge?) and your music taste with someone is a sign that you genuinely care about them. It could be a longtime friend you’re sharing it with — I recently made a playlist for a friend and titled it “you’ll probably hate this” — a significant other, or perhaps someone else in your life. So, presumably, it makes sense that an author adding songs to a book is giving their heart along with their words. 
I adore Morgan Matson, and not only because, once upon a time, she went to USC and worked at Vroman’s while at Occidental. (If you’ve never been to the oldest independent bookstore in Southern California, what’s your excuse?) But, it is also because her books are wonderful and have long since held a space in my heart as never-fail comfort books.
One book that I particularly love is “Amy and Roger’s Epic Detour.” I have an old copy where I dog-eared the bottom corner on each page that features a playlist, which includes gems such as Sufjan Stevens “Come on! Feel the Illinoise!”, R.E.M’s “Nightswimming,” The Cure’s “Just Like Heaven” and so many more. 
The story follows the titular Amy after her father dies in a car accident and her mom wants to start a new life. This means driving the family vehicle across the country to Connecticut from California. This is where family friend Roger enters and a detour across the country begins.
I feel as though there is a particular magic to a road trip story and maybe that’s coming from my own personal bias and my deep familiarity with the northbound 5 freeway. Of course, if nothing else, “Amy and Roger’s Epic Detour” taught me the Kansas state motto “Ad Astra Per Aspera” or “through hardship to the stars.” 
I might be bending my own prompt’s rules here, but this of course, popped into my mind. One of the greatest parts of how the online world adds to a connection beyond state lines and boundaries is that authors can connect with readers.
Alexandra Bracken has taken advantage of this with a menu on her author website displaying “book playlists.” She has one for each of her books, including her wildly successful series “The Darkest Minds.” It’s one of those instances where, yes, I know I loved the book, but perhaps the songs made me fall in love with it the slightest bit more.
“The Darkest Minds” follows a mysterious disease that kills American children and teens. For those who survive, many are sent to “rehabilitation” camps for unexplained abilities that terrify their parents. One kid in particular — Ruby — ends up escaping one of the most notorious camps and ends up with a motley crew of kids with similar abilities. This book has one of the best little monologues that totally tore apart my heart at age 16. Please consider that my official endorsement: It crushed my heart. Read it. 
Of course, all of this music and books isn’t even taking into consideration the fact that I am still obsessed with the “Me Before You” and the “Catching Fire” soundtrack. But, frankly, books are paired with music quite a lot on the aforementioned “clock app.” “BookTok” has changed the landscape of how books are sold today even more so than the now passè “BookTube.”
Books such as E. Lockhart’s 2014 “We Were Liars” ended up on the New York Times’ bestseller list because of TikTok, despite the novel being released more than five years ago. It also means I want to talk to anyone and everyone about how book selling has shifted in the last two years.
Frankly, the changing literary market (and the fact that too many loose acquaintances becausedue to this app is still not enough for me to download it. But it does ensure that through music, books are finding new audiences every day — just as auditory artists are. 
Right now, there is no better time than to take a peek at “BookTok” and perhaps find a new story within the feed. If you need me, I’ll be learning the “Berries and Cream” dance and crafting playlists for my favorite books.

This past summer, “Hot Girl Summer” was all the rage and there was no limit to the amount of sunny, confident songs to bop along to.
Whether it was making a TikTok with your best friends or laying poolside, there’s no doubt the likes of Megan Thee Stallion, Flo Milli and Doja Cat filled your headphones. Yet, with the upcoming release of Taylor Swift’s re-recording of “Red (Taylor’s Version)” and Adele’s highly anticipated album “30,” there appears to be a shift in the music industry from pop anthems to solemn ballads; otherwise known as the transition from “Hot Girl Summer” to “Sad Girl Autumn.”
To get in the spirit of this gloomy shift in tunes, here are some albums that will prepare you for all the lovely autumn ditties to come.
Phoebe Bridgers “Punisher”
Praised widely by Bridgers’ fanbase, also known as “Pharbs,” “Punisher” was released June 2020 and swept the indie rock scene. Notable for her ethereal synths and sounds, “Punisher” fosters a comfortable anxiety and elicits a strong force of intimacy.
Bridgers explores heavy subject matters such as the fickle nature of human relationships, dissociation and identity crisis. Often featuring a folk rock vibe, “Punisher” also contains eccentric lyrics, various pop culture references and, of course, a hearty chorus of screams. If you’re looking for an upbeat sad bop, stream the track “Kyoto” and for those of you who can swallow an introspective epic, give “I Know the End” a try. 
Taylor Swift “folklore”
Straying drastically from her previous albums, Swift departs from her typical autobiographical albums outlining ex-relationships in an upbeat fashion to “folklore’s” mellow strings and lyrics that echo indie folk music. Swift recorded the album in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, with on-the-rise producer Jack Antonoff’s support.
In a nutshell, this album embodies the “cottagecore” aesthetic, as it features copious amounts of romanticism and melancholia. These themes are primarily explored through fictional narratives and novel characters, such as Betty, James and Inez. “folklore,” true to its time of conception, is reflective of a profound sense of introspection present within the younger generation. Your everyday hopeless romantic will thoroughly enjoy the songs “invisible string” and “the 1.”
Clairo “Sling”
“Sling” is the sophomore album for bedroom-pop-turned-folk-rock star Clairo. The album, released in July 2021, first previewed with her lead single “Blouse.” Once known for her artful descriptions of adolescent milestones and young love and electronic songs, “Sling” soulfully and bittersweetly explores the death of such topics while embodying 1970s rock (á la Joni Mitchell and Carole King).
Given this, the album seems to be a reaction to the social pressures Generation Z faces, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, dating, school, work, etc., and chooses to regress to a simpler time as a solution. “Sling” features fun tunes, such as “Amoeba” and more heart-wrenching sounds like “Harbor.” If you’re looking for an album featuring soft vocals and sighs, mellifluous instruments, this is the one for you. 
Mitski “Be the Cowboy”
There are high chances that you have had minimal exposure to indie rock artist Mitski’s fifth studio album, as one of her most popular songs, “Nobody,” is a single from the album that once dominated TikTok. 
“Be the Cowboy,” which was released in August 2018, features Mitski’s unique ability to flawlessly examine loneliness and its impact on the human condition. Challenging Clairo’s “Sling” for queen of introspection, Mitski is painfully honest in this album on the basis of how she perceives herself through the lens of fame and anxiety. Featuring her signature doubled vocals, Mitski delves into an, at times, uncomfortable level of vulnerability through soulful ballads and upbeat tunes. 
Lana Del Rey “Norman Fucking Rockwell!”
Released in August 2019, Del Rey’s sixth studio album “Norman Fucking Rockwell!” finds itself more in the vein of the psychedelic pop rock genre. Similar to the aforementioned albums, this album is inherently introspective, specifically in the realm of existence itself, freedom and even a lost sense of patriotism.
Notorious as one of the most problematic indie musicians who constantly keeps her fans shaking their heads at her latest controversies (who could forget her infamous mesh mask that she donned to attend a Los Angeles book signing in October 2020?), Del Rey nonetheless brilliantly achieves an album that features equal parts trap-pop and piano ballads, as demonstrated through the songs “Cinnamon Girl” and “Doin’ Time” making it a musical experience ready to please any type of music listener. 
Snail Mail “Lush”
Stunning indie rock fans with her debut album released in June 2018, Snail Mail (formerly known as Lindsey Jordan) leans into her sad sentimental nature and even creates rock songs that celebrate it. Despite sad subject matters such as unrequited love and just plain confusion, “Lush” highlights melancholia with drums and bass choruses. Her emotional honesty ties beautifully with her dulcet tone and features signature adolescent ingenuine dismissiveness (which is actually telling of someone who cares and feels very deeply). On this record, check out songs “Pristine” and “Heat Wave.”

When considering our bitterly divided country, the ability to sell a policy plan in an unfamiliar market is an all too rare but increasingly important skill nowadays. For politicians, blanket statements and basic talking points only get them so far outside of their own constituencies. Unfortunately, it seems like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont didn’t get the memo before he published a scathing op-ed in Sen. Joe Manchin’s hometown newspaper last month.
Published in the Charleston Gazette-Mail on Oct. 15, the op-ed was meant to appeal to West Virginians in Manchin’s home state. Sanders outlined how President Joe Biden’s $3.5 trillion Build Back Better spending plan would help West Virginians. He first talked about the 1% and the wealth gap before moving into how the Build Back Better plan would address the working-class families’ plight. Sanders’ op-ed also extensively discussed the plan’s intent to lower prescription drug prices and stand up to Big Pharma.
Sanders also touched on the plan’s expansion of Medicare to cover hearing aids, eyeglasses, dental care and home-based healthcare. He also emphasized the spending plan’s necessity to apply to children as well, warning that the older American Rescue Plan’s $300 direct payments to working-class families could end if Congress stalled the Build Back Better plan any longer. 
After briefly talking about climate change and the plan’s intent to cut carbon emissions and move the nation toward more sustainable energy alternatives, Sanders ended his op-ed by calling out Manchin from West Virginia, singling him out as one of two Democratic Senators who oppose Biden’s ambitious spending plan.
Manchin fired back in a statement that fumed over Sanders’ op-ed, writing, “This isn’t the first time an out-of-stater has tried to tell West Virginians what is best for them despite having no relationship to our state.” 
Manchin is simply incorrect in one way here: The Build Back Better plan, with the provisions Sanders listed in his op-ed, will greatly help West Virginia. Manchin also lacks a soapbox to stand on when it comes to movements toward sustainable energy alternatives. Investigative journalism revealed that the Senator from West Virginia is a modern-day Mr. Peabody, raking in roughly half a million in dividends every year from his millions of dollars of coal company stock. If that isn’t a conflict of interest, I don’t know what is.
There is no doubt that a serious financial investment in West Virginia is long overdue, but Sanders’ approach to such an investment has Southerners rightfully wary of policies that would otherwise be incredibly beneficial.
If you get the chance to read Sanders’ op-ed, you’ll find he doesn’t mention West Virginia or West Virginians all that often. In fact, West Virginia is only explicitly mentioned twice in the 900-word article. It is a bad look when an article, meant to convince and compel a particular audience, can be applied and reused for multiple other audiences. If anything, the op-ed sounds as if it were ripped right from the pages of the Vermont Senator’s website, with little edits to make it specifically tailored toward West Virginians. 
When the independent Senator from Vermont actually brings up the Mountain State, he often follows it with a mention of his own home state, casting the two states as being cut from the same metaphorical cloth — as underdogs fighting greedy corporations and the uber wealthy. West Virginia and Vermont have problems unique to each state; it would be heinous to compare the two or treat both as if they share the same values and priorities.
In perhaps a bigger waste of printer ink, Sanders’ op-ed hits at the heart of coal country. The climate change warnings might be great campaign press outside a state so dependent on the coal industry, but when so many West Virginian families depend on coal jobs to make ends meet, a promise to move toward sustainable energy comes off as a threat to nab jobs from families that worked in the coal industry for generations.
With that being said, Sanders riles up great masses of people to a cause. His entire presidential bids’ appeal centered around his ability to frame his candidacy as a revolution of the majority against a corporate minority. In the case of Sanders vs. Manchin, Vermont’s independent Senator can gain the ear of many more West Virginians if he employed that appeal and tailored it to their needs and values.

In preparation for the impending Thanksgiving feast, a question broils for film students far and wide. Every year, film students all over the world converge on their hometowns with a discernible air of trepidation, knowing that, at any moment, it — a sentence tinged with judgement, whose arrival can be sensed like a crumb sinking to the bottom of a shaky wine glass — will come: “What’s a degree like that good for anyway?”
Here is a truthful rebuttal, good for not only this question but also most questions: It depends.
The cons are extremely visible, and they are all Uncle Joe wants to talk about: the high cost, the degree’s inflexibility and the impracticality of the degree’s ultimate career goal.
There is merit to this skepticism. Almost two years ago, the coronavirus washed up on our shores and instantly halted film and TV production. The industry suffered greatly during the shutdown and has yet to fully recover. Thousands lost their jobs, many of whom may never find them again.
It is also familiar lore that the lates and greats who built this city into the West’s entertainment empire never attended film school. Christopher Nolan studied English literature; Steven Spielberg was rejected from USC and Tarantino never even graduated from high school. It is arguable, then, that if one possesses even a shred of natural-born talent and unrelenting discipline, they can find success outside the confines of an educational establishment.
That is true — sometimes. It depends.
An estimated 35% of all job openings require at least a bachelor’s degree. Going to college, at this point, becomes much less an option than a societal expectation. If one fulfills that expectation to make career-building and job-searching less miserable experiences, it may as well be in the pursuit of something they feel passionate about, right?
Furthermore, film programs require balancing two equally weighted spinning plates: One holds an immense amount of collaboration, time management, budgeting and critical analysis, while the other holds grand creative or artistic merit, morale and social messaging. Keeping these plates spinning for always and eternity is unique to the field, forcing its torch-carriers to adapt with immediacy. Upon graduation, these abilities are still incredibly valuable. 
Another pro: In most film programs, the production of short films, pilots and web-series is the curriculum’s essential center. Students are expected to know how to work with cutting-edge equipment and software, often provided by the school. By the time caps and gowns are ready for pickup, soon-to-be-alumni have well-produced, medium-to-high budget original works bulking up their portfolios. For that reason alone, film school is worth the expense.
Then again… it depends. One could make an argument that tuition money could be spent directly on a passion project, forgoing all of the class schedules and homework assignments in favor of just making the damn thing.
That is what Grace Gao, a graduate student at the School of Cinematic Arts in the John Wells Writing for Screen & Television program, said many of her undergraduate peers did.
“Many of the students had to graduate early just to have the money to make their production come to life… So not everybody could really afford to go through the entire four years and also take money out of [their] pocket to make films at the same time,” Gao said. 
Grace hits on another well-known secret of the entertainment industry: Nepotism is blood, and, without a connection to someone who has already “made it,” we are as good as a bag of unemployed bones. 
“After I graduated from undergrad – which was also a film school, NYU – I landed a job as a writer/director’s assistant. It was a very haphazardly found opportunity and the only reason why I found it is because of a very remote family connection… Given how competitive the industry is, [not] everyone can really find an entryway into it. I felt very fortunate.”
However, one of graduate programs’ strongest pulls is the promise of a highly-motivated, like-minded cohort. The School of Cinematic Arts echoed this sentiment during the first event of Welcome Week, ensuring new Masters of Fine Arts candidates that the people they have just met will accompany them through the majority of their career. This is vital, considering the industry’s heavy reliance on word-of-mouth referrals.
All in all, the question of whether or not film school is worth it plays out like a tennis match between Venus and Serena Williams: Either team is a great bet, but it ultimately comes down to a very extensive pros and cons list, gut instinct, wind speed and direction.
