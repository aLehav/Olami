A contribution to incumbent Councilman Bernard Parks’ campaign has instigated a debate between the two candidates vying for the city council’s 8th District seat about whether or not the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum should host raves.
Last week, the Los Angeles Times reported that Parks had received a $500 campaign contribution from Todd DeStefano. DeStefano is currently under investigation by local and state authorities to see if any laws were broken when he served on the Coliseum’s Commission to oversee security, while also being a paid promoter for Insomniac Inc., the company that hosted the 2010 Electric Daisy Carnival at the Coliseum.
A 15-year-old girl died of a drug overdose during EDC at the Coliseum.
Forescee Hogan-Rowles, who is running against Parks for the 8th District seat, asserts that Parks should return DeStefano’s contribution.
“[Parks] should return the money,” Hogan-Rowles said. “It is not in a gray area.”
Parks, however, maintains that DeStefano committed no crime and he will therefore not return his donation.
Hogan-Rowles not only disapproves of the donation but said she is also a harsh critic of raves, insisting that raves foster a negative environment in the district.
“[Raves] should not be held at the Coliseum,” Hogan-Rowles said. “They are not appropriate for our neighborhood and our community.”
Parks contends that the electronic music events that occur at the Coliseum are not raves, and the events reflect the music preferences of the community.
“A rave is an illegal underground party,” Parks said. “What we have at the Coliseum is an electric music festival, which is the number-one genre of music worldwide.”
Parks also noted that musical performer Will.i.am headlined both the Electric Daisy Carnival and the 2011 Super Bowl halftime show.
“The headline performer at [the Electric Daisy Carnival] happened to have been the headline at the Super Bowl halftime show,” Parks said. “I think it is not an underground event, but a mainstream event.”
The main concern of rave opponents is safety. Hogan-Rowles said she worries in particular about the safety of the youth, who comprise a majority of the attendees at such events.
“If our youth and young people, who we are expecting to be leaders, are dying or suffering injuries from raves, then they are not events we should support and they are not events that I support,” Hogan-Rowles said.
Parks said safety is the number one priority of the Coliseum and event providers.
“It’s absolutely incumbent, whether it’s an ’SC football game or a music festival, that we be absolutely concerned about the safety of the community and participants above all,” Parks said.
Parks also supports raves because of their economic benefits. He cites studies from event promoters, which state that electronic music events stimulate the economies of hosting communities.
“If we believe what we have been told by the event promoters, 4,000 jobs are added to the community for music events,” Parks said. “Their economic studies predict $32 million is infused into the community.”
Hogan-Rowles highlights, though, that these jobs are only temporary and their economic impact is short-lived.
“Parks has stated that raves create 4,000 jobs, but these are one-night events,” Hogan-Rowles said. “We want to create living wage jobs, where people have benefits and can count on an income going forward.”
The increased prevalence of raves in Los Angeles prompted President C. L. Max Nikias to address students, through a letter last month, of the dangers of attending such events. He went so far as to explicitly advise students against attending raves.
“With the collective support of the university’s senior administration — and as the father of two USC students — I strongly discourage your participation in rave events,” Nikias wrote.
Dylan Moore, a freshman majoring in software engineering, said he believes people shouldn’t be restricted from attending raves because of the poor choices some participants make.
“Students should spend their time as they will,” Moore said. “Raves aren’t dangerous, it is what individual people decide to do that can be harmful.”
Some students say the clear division between the candidates in regards to raves might impact their vote.
“I would be in favor of a candidate who was against raves,” said Alex Plueger, a senior majoring in business administration. “I have been to raves before and know they are dangerous, and I have friends that have had trouble at [raves].”
Elections for the 8th District seat, which represents USC and its surrounding community, will be held March 8.
What an odd stance for Hogan-Rowles to take. Of course he can make that contribution. Especially since he hasn’t been convicted of anything, donating to a candidate as a private citizen is pretty innocuous. If DeStephano had Insomniac dump money into Parks’ campaign, then she’s got a case, but she needs to separate her own issue with raves from the basic standards of campaign contributions.

With Sasquatch celebrating its tenth anniversary, you would think that the organizers would bust out the big names, but Coachella most definitely wins in that department.
Coachella’s 2011 lineup is being headlined by Kings of Leon, Arcade Fire, and the legend in the making, Mr. Kanye West himself.  
This proved to be a difficult follow-up after last year’s lineup which featured Jay-Z, Muse and Gorillaz, but Coachella has outdone itself yet again.
Then again, maybe your preference comes down to a matter of taste.  Coachella has somewhat more mainstream artists now that the festival has increased in popularity, while Sasquatch features more underground, low-key and indie bands.
Granted, there is plenty of overlap since both festivals attract laid back, musically well-rounded crowds.  Cold War Kids, Flogging Molly, Robyn, Skrillex, Bright Eyes, Jenny and Johnny, Best Coast, Chromeo, CSS, Ratatat and the unpronounceable !!! will appear both in Indio Valley and George, Washington.
Maybe Sasquatch is more appealing since it’s off the radar. Not as many people know about it so it doesn’t attract as many conformists who are only showing up because they recognize a few big names.  Not that Coachella doesn’t feature any underground bands, but in the eyes of some the choice is clear.
“Sasquatch is what Coachella was five years ago,” said Christina Ellis, a freshman majoring in.  This means Coachella now has to appeal to the masses, while Sasquatch can take more creative liberties.
While Sasquatch contains many small bands on the rise, wouldn’t you rather see them in more of an intimate setting versus a chaotic, drug-induced environment?  Wouldn’t you rather see Iron and Wine or The Antlers in a small café and actually remember the music?  With small mellow bands, the setting makes the difference and it allows for one to have a direct experience with the artists, which to most music seems the clear choice.
Both festivals are valuable in either right, but there’s no denying that Coachella has a more diverse and intriguing line-up and an environment meant for chaotic fun, making it slightly more worthwhile.
It’s such a pity that tickets are already sold out.

Sanchez and Poldma earn Pac-10 honors
Senior Maria Sanchez has garnered a long list of accolades during her time at USC, and the women’s tennis captain continues to add to her legacy after being named Pac-10 Player of the Week for the fourth time in her Trojan career.
Sanchez is currently riding a 15-match undefeated streak in the singles department, and has been the driving force behind the USC women’s hot start to the season.
After dispatching No. 8 Aeriel Ellis in both her singles and doubles matchup Sunday, along with USF’s No. 25 Irene Rehberger, Sanchez jumped to the front of the discussion for National Player of the Year.
—Jesse Paguaga
USC men’s tennis player senior Jaak Poldma was named Pac-10 Player of the Week following an impressive win against Pepperdine’s Sebastian Fanselow on Friday.
Poldma, nationally ranked No. 94 in singles and No. 51 in doubles with partner sophomore J.T. Sundling, received the honor for the second time in his career.
The award comes on the heels of a successful singles season for Poldma, who is currently 16-3 overall and holds a six-game winning streak and a perfect record in dual matches.

Colbert set on making it back to NFL 
USC tight ends assistant Keary Colbert, who joined the staff a year ago, is stepping down in hopes of revitalizing his NFL playing career, according to the football office.
Colbert, 28, was among the favorites to replace the recently departed wide receivers coach John Morton, who left to take on a similar position with the San Francisco 49ers last month.
“After spending a year working with the tight ends at USC as a graduate assistant, it ignited my passion and fire to compete at the highest level,” Colbert said in a statement. “I’ve been training and getting myself physically prepared to make a comeback in the NFL.”
Colbert, a former 2004 second-round draft pick of the Carolina Panthers, spent five years in the NFL, where he amassed a total of 121 catches for 1,540 yards and eight touchdowns. He set Panther rookie records with 47 receptions, 754 receiving yards and five touchdowns.
He spent the 2008 season with Seattle, Denver and Detroit. In 2009, he played for the UFL’s Florida Tuskers.
A four-year starter for USC, Colbert once held the school’s all-time mark for receptions with 207. He was also a member of the Trojans’ 2003 national championship team.

The USC men’s basketball team is struggling. The USC men’s volleyball team is not.
Yes, the top-ranked men’s volleyball team lost its first game of what was a perfect season over the weekend, a five-set heartbreaker to Pepperdine. But the mild setback didn’t shake the college volleyball world.
The Trojans are still the No. 1 team in the land.
The USC men’s basketball team had an equally disappointing and even more costly weekend. USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s boys split two home games, sputtering out badly Saturday in an ugly loss to Oregon. The Trojans were already a long shot to make the Big Dance. Now, they’d be lucky to make the National Invitational Tournament.
When you look at the two programs, it’s like looking at two houses in disparate conditions. One, nearly pristine, has been meticulously improved year after year and is the envy of the neighborhood.
The other house was bought after a foreclosure. Although it’s not rundown, the roof is leaking. And as soon as you plug one hole, another keeps popping up.
I don’t think I have to tell you which house represents which program.
The two teams are on different tracks. The volleyball team is headed straight to the top, national championship or bust. The basketball team is just trying to move in a positive direction, to finish out an up-and-down season on a high note.
Volleyball and basketball aren’t so different after all. Both are games made up of runs. Both rely on a certain rhythm and flow. Spacing is crucial, teamwork essential. Point is, a lesson from one is easily transferable to the other.
So what cues can the men’s basketball team take from the success of senior opposite hitter Murphy Troy and the men’s volleyball team? If there’s one word, it’s consistency.
I was the volleyball beat writer two years ago. After moving on to other sports, I popped my head into volleyball practice last week, and it was as if I were in a time warp.
Very little had changed. The atmosphere was more intense, but the faces were practically the same.
Troy is still the power hitter on the outside. Senior setter Riley McKibbin still quarterbacks the offense. Senior middle blocker Austin Zahn is still a presence at the net. Senior outside Tri Bourne is still making teams pay when they forget about him on the other side.
Those four seniors form the core of the team that has been steadily building since 2007. They were USC coach Bill Ferguson’s golden recruiting class and they are living up to expectations. They came in together as freshmen and the only direction to go was up. They were a few points away from winning the national title in 2009 and still have one last crack at it.
Compare that with O’Neill’s basketball squad. A very capable coach, O’Neill came in two years ago after Tim Floyd’s abrupt resignation and an exodus of recruits that would have impressed Moses. The program was nearing disarray, and O’Neill helped to stabilize it.
But consistency continues to elude the Trojans on the basketball court. They have nothing that approaches the consistency of the volleyball team.
Junior forward Nikola Vucevic is really the only player remaining who had any impact in the Tim Floyd days. Senior forward Alex Stepheson had to sit out that year because he transferred in and senior guard Donte Smith had not discovered his jump shot yet.
Meanwhile, new players like freshmen guard Maurice Jones and forward Garrett Jackson were thrown into the mix early and are still struggling to find their way.
So the basketball team takes two steps backward as soon as it takes one step forward, while the volleyball team steadily climbs.
Players on both teams work equally hard. Both coaching staffs are just as dedicated. But Ferguson’s starters are four seniors and two juniors, all of whom have been at USC their entire college careers, learning the offense, buying into the system.
Meanwhile, O’Neill must go with what he has, which is a group of guys who, with the exception of a few, haven’t logged a whole lot of games together.
Any rebuilding program struggles with these issues. This is part of the process. Progress is often slow. Fans get impatient and players get frustrated.
The only way to have lasting success is to stay the course. It is a valuable lesson the basketball team would be wise to heed.

Senior Lyndsay DePaul helped lead USC to victory over crosstown rival UCLA in its last dual meet of the season. The Daily Trojan sat down with the co-captain and asked to share us her thoughts on the season, and how the team will prepare for the NCAAs and Pac-10 championships.
Leadership · DePaul is one of the top butterflyers in the nation and owns numerous USC swim school records. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Daily Trojan: Looking back at the team’s regular season, what lessons did you and the other swimmers take out of the dual meets you participated in?
DePaul: We learned not to take some teams too lightly and we learned what it’s like to win and what it’s like to lose. We know what we can do, we learned what we are capable or and what we aren’t capable of — this has all been a learning experience.
DT: Your two losses came against California and Stanford. How did losing to those Northern California schools influence the team?
DePaul: Going into those two meets, we didn’t really know what to expect. We were going up there coming off some really hard training and we knew they were going to be ready for us. We flew up the day of the Cal meet and had to be at the meet two hours after we got there, so the travel situation was tough. Our main problem was that we kept getting out-touched and that makes a huge difference at dual meets. We have been working on our finishes and hitting the wall so that we won’t be getting out-touched by anyone.
DT: What was the goal of the women’s swim team throughout the season and how did the swimmers work to achieve it?
DePaul: We set multiple goals and one of them was to win all of our dual meets, which didn’t happen. Another one was to be top four at the NCAAs and I really believe we can do that. Hopefully we can go to NCAAs with a full roster of girls, which is 18 girls, and win.
DT: As a co-captain on the team, what did you notice about the team dynamic and motivation as the season went on?
DePaul: Our freshmen and sophomores were very mature and jumped on board very quickly. This year they made sure that we were all on the same page. It is our [seniors] last year but they have been helping us out.
DT: What was the most exciting moment about the women’s dual meet season?
DePaul: I think the UCLA meet as a whole was monumental. Everybody’s attitudes and strength was great. It was exciting to see everybody’s confidence at yesterday’s meet. It really set the stage for Pac-10s and NCAAs.
DT: What is the message you would like to send to the USC community as the women’s swim team prepares to wrap up its season with the NCAAs and Pac-10s?
DePaul: Our girl’s and boy’s teams work really, really hard and that fan support would be greatly appreciated. We put a lot of effort in and it is nice to have support and have people cheer for us. Thank you to everyone who has supported us and followed us throughout the season.

There’s something about Pixar that just works.
Since the Academy created the Best Animated Feature category in 2001, Pixar has taken five of those nine Oscars and every one of their films released in the last 10 years has been nominated.
Before that, Pixar had never released a feature film that wasn’t nominated for at least one Oscar.
Up and Toy Story 3 are two of only three animated films ever nominated for Best Picture (Beauty and the Beast was the third).
There might not be a single production company that consistently makes such commercially successful and critically acclaimed films. What’s the secret to Pixar’s impeccable record?
According to Pixar’s corporate statement, its objective is simply “to combine proprietary technology and world-class creative talent to develop computer-animated feature films with memorable characters and heartwarming stories that appeal to audiences of all ages.”
That sounds easy enough, and Pixar’s certainly managed to accomplish such a goal with each of its films.
Its incredible box office record is proof of these films’ mass appeal. Toy Story 3 was the highest grossing film of 2010, pulling in a whopping $920 million. That kind of money isn’t just kids’ stuff.
But Pixar’s corporate objective doesn’t capture what makes it special.
All movies ought to strive for memorable characters, and heartwarming endings generally fall within the territory of family fare.
Of course, Pixar is not the only company that makes excellent animated films. It just inexplicably does it the best.
Last year, five of the highest grossing films were animated. Dreamworks is generally considered Pixar’s biggest competition in terms of quality animated movies, and the former’s How to Train Your Dragon was highly praised.
It is arguably the second-best reviewed among those top-grossing films, following only Toy Story 3, whose 99 percent on Rotten Tomatoes just barely outdoes Dragon’s 98 percent.
Pixar’s and Dreamworks’ animation domination hasn’t stopped others from getting into the fray, but those who try rarely live up to the absurdly high bar that Pixar has set.
Last weekend’s release of Gnomeo and Juliet, an adaptation of Shakespeare’s classic tragedy in which the main characters are lawn gnomes, is the first of many family releases set for 2011. It’s reception has been lukewarm at best.
New York Times’ critic Stephen Holden writes that the Gnomeo and Juliet characters have “little emotional resonance.”
Granted, Woody and Buzz have had more than 10 years to work their way into our hearts, but the emotional resonance of characters like lovesick robot WALL-E and Up’s crotchety old Carl is undeniable.
Variety, on the other hand, gives the gnome romance a generally positive review, but specifically notes that it “never quite plumbs the existential depths of [the Toy Story] franchise.”
Pixar’s stories delve into issues such as love, loss, death, growing up and what it means to be a family. Many of the best films — animated or live action — simply don’t achieve the complexity and sophistication that Pixar somehow manages to pull off every time.
So is there a secret to Pixar’s unheard-of consistency?
When Ed Catmull, president of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, visited USC in 2009, he didn’t provide any easy formula for the studio’s success. Pixar seems to just always assemble incredible teams to tell great stories.
“We realized having lower standards for something is bad for your soul,” Catmull said.
The fact that Catmull cares about his team’s collective soul already sets Pixar miles apart from the major studios and countless production companies, such as those willing to produce Saw XI, to make a quick buck.
The people at Pixar care. They care about the quality of their product and they care about telling good, original stories. Even when the characters are monsters, cars or toys, there is something deeply human in every story Pixar tells.
The originality and genuine heart of Pixar features are a breath of fresh air among all of the meaningless dreck that is released by studios every week.
Toy Story 3 might not win Best Picture in a few weeks, but Pixar has created something better than award bait. It made something that is good for the soul.

When discussing new albums, “different” isn’t a word most avid fans like to hear.
Right after “I liked them before they got big,” the oldest phrase in the music fan book is “I like their earlier stuff … but they suck now.”
Strange vision · People’s Key, as is evident in the album cover, shows the more experimental side of Bright Eyes, with help from Denny Brewer. - Photo courtesy of Saddle Creek  
Although bands inevitably get sick of their older work, fans can’t move past it.
After the band’s four-year hiatus and numerous side projects from Conor Oberst, it would be great to hear another classic, acoustic-heavy alternative country album from the members of Bright Eyes.
Their newest work, The People’s Key, is not that album. Oberst himself said he wanted to get away from the rootsy Americana music for which they became popular with this new release.
Sure, they’ve done it before. 2005’s Digital Ash In A Digital Urn was the band’s first full-out electronic effort. And although it was unlike any of the band’s earlier work, it was good. But it was released on the same day as the old-fashioned, rootsy Americana album I’m Wide Awake It’s Morning, to keep the old fans interested.
That’s why I approached The People’s Key with extreme caution.
Complaints that the album is too different are somewhat warranted. Certain songs, such as the electric guitar-ridden “Jejune Stars,” would be unidentifiable as a Bright Eyes track without Oberst’s signature shaky voice and poetic lyrics.
The band also delves more heavily into psychedelia throughout the album. “Firewall,” the album’s opener, begins with a nearly two-and-a-half minute rant over ambient sounds by the 60-something Denny Brewer, singer of the politically opinionated band Refried Ice Cream, which has opened for Oberst in the past.
Brewer’s speeches on the fourth dimension, humans with reptilian-like features and other strange subjects continue at various points throughout the album. His voice is manipulated for an added trippy effect.
This type of aesthetic behavior isn’t unusual for Bright Eyes, but it feels over-the-top in this album.
The effect-heavy elements, such as the numerous unnecessary echoes and voice warps, are forced at certain points.
At times, Oberst seems like a pre-teen who just discovered Pink Floyd and his computer’s ability to run GarageBand. The effects are overused and predictable.
Overall, however, the CD still sounds somewhat like a Bright Eyes album and is a natural sonic progression from the band’s earlier works.
True fans won’t feel betrayed, however, as the newer elements of these songs add something unique and interesting to the band’s catalogue.
For instance, the beat on “A Machine Spiritual” sounds, not so subtly, like a machine working over and over. It’s theatrical and cheesy, but it somehow works.
With its simple beat, use of synthesizers and a chorus of here it comes / that heavy love, the lead single “Shell Games” -has all the makings of a cheesy ’80s pop/rock song.
But it has enough changes and captivating instrumentation that makes it possibly one of the album’s best tracks.
Different or not, there’s just something inherently Bright Eyes about it.
The album’s most stripped-down, intimate moment occurs on “Ladder Song,” which consists solely of a piano and Oberst’s clear, unaltered voice.
This is the type of situation in which Oberst usually shines, but this song lacks the uncomfortable romance of similarly bare songs like “Lua.”
The LP’s closer, “One for You and One for Me” sounds like an LCD Sound system B-side with its repetitive but complex drum loop and chorus.
And the heavy beat on “Approximate Sunlight” sounds like it could fit on Digital Ash In A Digital Urn.
In the end, there is enough variation on The People’s Key that things stay interesting.
But is the new Bright Eyes album a career defining work of art? Maybe.
Oberst and co. might not have mastered this non-rootsy, non-Americana music completely, but they’ve definitely taken a step in the right direction.

The wild dating habits, passionate necking and cohabitation began a day early this Valentine’s Day week.
On Sunday, the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association presented “Sex and the City Zoo 2,” a romantic and provocative evening for all couples.
The day was dedicated to talking about romantic unions in the animal kingdom. The talk also attempted to solve the age-long question of whether a relationship is necessary.
The reception began in sophisticated style with an acoustic guitarist plucking out “Für Elise,” while an assortment of savory and delicate desserts decorated the tables. The cultured atmosphere was complete with a tiny bar to the side.
The real distraction was neither the food nor the drinks, but an adorable armadillo and a small, sleeping porcupine.
Couples surrounded the two show-stealers, ooh-ing and aw-ing while their handlers presented them.
Not only is Valentine’s Day a time to show that special someone love and affection, it’s also a day when couples have the special opportunity to exhibit their creativity and intelligence, particularly in their choice of date location.
One such innovative couple was Mike Miller and Stephanie Scher of Los Feliz, both members of GLAZA.
“It’s a very interesting subject matter and a way to beat the crowds [at the restaurants],” Scher said.
But the program was no regular day at the zoo.
The entertaining and very informative presentation definitely met Scher and Miller’s expectations.
Jason Jacobs, L.A. Zoo’s director of public relations and marketing, supplied the night’s entertainment, using a slideshow presentation unlike any professor at USC.
His lecture, complete with one-of-a-kind photos, discussed animal mating and dating habits, some of which are suprisingly similar to our own human actions and attitudes.
To start off, Jacobs discussed the pros and cons of staying single and solitary versus dating or participating in social groups.
“One of the advantages of being single is that you can do things and come and go as you please, within reason,” Jacobs said.
But whether human or animal, having a companion or being social also has its life-and-death advantages.
“If you are a member of a herd, you only have to be quicker than the slowest member so you don’t perish becoming dinner to a predator like a lion,” Jacobs said.
Jacobs shared the interesting methods animals use to attract their mates. When it comes to the American bison, the male can tell if a female bison is in heat based on how her urine tastes. The scent of a male bull’s urine also contributes to a female bull’s ovulation.
Yet there are still hilarious connections between the human and animal kingdom is their strategies in attracting the opposite sex.
The African kob exhibits human-like attributes when choosing a potential mate. Jacobs compared the kob’s strategy of mating in a “Lek” to that of the atmosphere of a modern nightclub or bar.
“[Male kobs’] posture, they spar, they have various positions they take up and usually the males in the middle of the Lek are the strongest and the most fit,” Jacobs said.
This sounds curiously similar to the break-dancer who impresses all the ladies by taking the spotlight in the center of the dance mosh pit.
Throughout the evening, Jacobs related some animal mating habits that were both shocking and disturbing.
One example was a picture of a very large, dangling elephant genetilia, which caused quite a ruckus of laughter.
“Unlike other 16 year olds, I wasn’t giggling when I saw this,” Jacobs said when describing when he took it. “I was like, ‘Wow.’ I’ve always wanted to work with animals. You see the good and the bad.”
On a more serious note, Jacobs related how rhinos can be so violent when trying to impregnate a female that in some cases, the females are killed.
“If things got too hairy we would drive a pick up truck in between the rhinos to separate them,” Jacobs said.
The evening wrapped up with a silly survey called, “What Type of Lover You Are,” when the audience members could find which animal corresponds with their sexual personality.
The audience was a mix of gibbons, a type of ape that lives in monogamous pairs, and gorillas, the ape who doesn’t sleep with the same female twice.
For first dates, this was definitely not the average small talk.

The dynamic between China and the United States has always been more than a little dysfunctional. Back in the day, we passed the Chinese Exclusion Act and they fought against us in the Vietnam War. Today, we question the value of their currency. They send us toys coated in lead paint.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
But one aspect of the relationship between the Chinese and U.S. governments has improved in recent years, particularly since President Barack Obama took office, which holds an enormous potential to benefit the economies of both nations: cooperation surrounding clean energy.
The green partnership between the two countries runs deeper than most people probably realize. We now have both a U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center and a U.S.-China Ten Year Framework for Cooperation on Energy and the Environment, which coordinate research and funding to facilitate the expansion of clean energy.
Despite the tensions of the past, such a partnership seems natural. We are the two largest economies, we are the largest consumers of coal and oil and we are the largest emitters of greenhouse gases.
These efforts are more than symbolic handshakes. China and the United States are leading an Electric Vehicles Initiative, which has hosted research workshops and is working with seven other countries to track electric vehicle production across the globe. China and the United States have each pledged to contribute $75 million during the next five years to Clean Energy Research Center, according to a January progress report released by the U.S. Department of Energy.
“Our clean energy partnership with China can help boost America’s exports, creating jobs here at home, and ensure that our country remains at the forefront of technology innovation,” U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in the report.
That’s not to suggest the United States is the sole benefactor of the partnership.
We’re equally invested in the well being of China’s clean energy endeavors, and using our own expertise to help move them forward; among other things, the United States is participating in a Shale Gas Resource Initiative to help China more efficiently utilize its natural resources.
What we have right now is that rare breed of partnership in which both parties bring something to the table and neither seems to be merely leeching off the other. But we need to keep expanding on it, or risk being left behind.
China clearly recognizes that it can’t afford to run on coal forever. Last year, the Chinese government invested more than $50 billion in clean energy, far outspending the United States.
A Chinese solar plant recently landed a photovoltaic project in Arizona over a number of prominent American companies, and as of January, Chinese wind turbines  harness more power than do U.S. turbines.
China can still benefit from the resources and expertise of the United States. But if we don’t stress that point now by strengthening our existing partnership, both countries could miss out on the benefits of future collaboration.
A mutual dislike of smog isn’t enough to erase 150 years of political tension. The relationship between the two nations is still dysfunctional and the realm of clean energy isn’t safe from that. True to form, the United States is challenging the validity of China’s wind energy subsidies as we speak.
But both countries are going to have to set aside any inherent suspicions and keep trying to work conjointly if they want to reap the benefits.
“Over the last decade, experts from the United States … and Chinese policy makers have actively shared best practices for establishing demand-side energy efficiency programs, resulting in a recent Chinese policy in the power sector that can potentially save enough electricity to power 10 million Chinese homes,” said Barbara Finamore, senior attorney and China program director of the Natural Resource Defense Council, in the progress report. “This program is a testament to the value of long-term cooperation between the United States and China on clean energy.”

Train talk is not going away.
Amtrak California broke ridership records in 2010. Both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have consistently shifted policy focus onto high-speed rail — first with $8 billion in grants awarded early last year, and then with plans to spend $53 billion over six years to construct a high-speed rail across the country.
In short, there is an increasingly popular notion that trains are the solution to our congested and aging transportation network.
High-speed rail in California has received a lot of attention, given the transportation woes the state currently faces. From decaying and congested highways to overcrowded airports, California seems to be a natural spot for intercity rail — especially high-speed rail — to reassert itself.
But high-speed rail in California will simply  never achieve its full potential the way it is currently being executed by the California High Speed Rail Authority.
First and foremost, high-speed operations of the scale and magnitude that give high-speed rail its advantage will be physically impossible on the proposed line.
With 17 stops between San Diego and San Francisco and  16 stops between San Diego and Sacramento, trains will accelerate after leaving stations only to have to decelerate shortly thereafter, according to the CHSRA.
Some argue that not all trains will stop at all stations. Other trains will still make frequent stops, however. This slows down “express” service — double tracking is simply not sufficient to allow the faster trains to pass, even with railroad sidings that allow trains to pull off to the side off a mainline.
Past evidence suggests rail infrastructure projects are disproportionately prone to major cost overruns. Moreover, ridership overestimation only reinforces concern about how much revenue CHSRA should realistically expect to generate. Supplementing this uncertainty is the fact that the CHSRA is currently pricing tickets at well below market value, in accordance with the “public transportation” mentality of the system.
On top of that, California’s credit rating  — the worst in the nation — is not getting better anytime soon, causing the cost of debt needed to finance the project to skyrocket.
If California insists on developing high-speed rail, it must shift its paradigm. High-speed rail is not “public transportation,” and it should not be priced, financed or routed as such. Stations should be very limited in number, tracks should run straight through the flattest and most rural countryside available and tickets should be priced at or above market level.
Furthermore, private capital should play a significant role in financing the project — a point CHSRA has only half-heartedly embraced. If California high-speed rail is truly as attractive and potentially profit-making as CHSRA argues, then investors should be flocking to it. Currently, those investors are avoiding California high-speed rail like the plague.
High-speed rail is an attractive and potentially very lucrative infrastructure investment with the potential to change the way intra-regional, intercity travel is conducted in the United States.
But, as proposed, CHSRA’s plan to bring high-speed rail to both Palmdale and San Francisco, while selling tickets at half the price of airfare, is a looming trainwreck of epic proportions.

Haha I realized that I mistook UCLA for USC but it’s all the same nonsense.
“Some argue that not all trains will stop at all stations.”
Weasel words.  That implies there is some debate on the matter.  And there isn’t.  Further, it is intellectually dishonest to claim that the High-Speed Rail Authority denies that.
Second, there is considerable outside interest in the project, both from the private sector and from eight other countries that have signed agreements with the Authority.  But nobody’s going to freely throw their private money at this project more of the necessary federal funds are in place and state bond money starts flowing again.
I’m curious what research has been done to substantiate the views in this article, which I don’t agree with.  I believe that high speed rail is an important strategic initiative to both our economy and infrastructure.  Certainly the details need to be correctly implemented, but I’ve seen no evidence to date that this is not the case.
Fight On!
You are a graduate student at UCLA? Really? This article represents such a lack of research and commonsense. You get the most basic facts wrong.
I was recently down on myself because I am only going to CSU and never even applied to a UC, but this article makes me better a lot better.
I agree with John. Express trains will run past local service. Amtrak is already doing this on the Pacific Surfliner between San Diego and LA.
Also, please don’t elevate yourself above public transportation. The airline industry is an example of public transportation. There is no difference between Amtrak, Greyhound and your favorite airline. If anything, Amtrak and Greyhound may even have better on-time records. Also, local public transportation (bus and rail) is a great way to get to the airport or train station.
In regards to debt, the US government will likely contribute at least 1/3 (hopefully more) to the project. However, I wish California had a better debt rating.
You are aware, I assume, of the California High Speed Rail Authority 2009  Business Plan.  The schematic operations plan (Table A, page 66)  shows 114 trains in a 6 hour period on the initial San Francisco to Anaheim segment.  This is achieved by letting express trains  pass local trains in stations.  Check it out— Or do you  think that the business plan is in error.

A call reporting a bomb threat on campus was received by DPS officials today at 2 p.m., but according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle the threat was so vague that no action was necessary.
“It’s just a call that was received by our campus communications from an unknown male caller who made a very vague threat about placing a bomb on campus,” Carlisle said.
Cars were being turned away at the Figueroa Street entrance and it was rumored that the campus was on lockdown. Though DPS officers were deployed to predesignated areas in case of a lockdown, Carlisle said no lockdown took place and no search was conducted.
LAPD responded and is handling the investigation.

Voting for USG Senators and Presidential tickets will begin tomorrow, after two weeks of successful campaigning.
Despite low voter awareness and turnout for the debate last week, more students around campus seem prepared for the elections than before.
There was talk last week about how quietly the campaigns were running, especially compared to previous years, but when the voting booths open up things tend to get louder.
“It’s an exciting chance to see your candidate win and change things around campus,” said Rachel Lipari, a freshman majoring in psychology. “I haven’t really heard much about it this year, and I had no idea when or where the debate was held. I definitely plan on voting, I just don’t know where it will be happening.”
The booths will be set up in four locations around campus from tomorrow until Thursday, and anyone who misses them can cast their votes online at usg.usc.edu.

ESPN has set game times for three Thursday night Pac-12 matches in the upcoming season, including one on USC’s schedule.
The Trojans will take on the California Bears at 6 p.m. on Oct. 13. Because of extensive renovations to Cal’s Memorial Stadium, the game — like all of the Bears’ home games — will be played at AT&T Park, the home of the San Francisco Giants.
The other two Thursday Pac-12 games are Cal at Oregon on Oct. 6 and UCLA at Arizona on Oct. 20.
Not ALL Cal games will be played at AT&T.  The opener on 9/3 vs Fresno State will be played at Candlestick Park.  It is billed as a neutral site game, and Cal is skr3Wing us season ticket holders over by making us purchase tickets for that game as an “extra.”  Pure bu11sh1t!  Nothing but a money grab.

Atlas Shrugged: Part 1
Coming to theaters Apr. 15
Sure, most of us haven’t touched an Ayn Rand title since 9th or 10th grade, but we think we would remember if Atlas Shrugged was an action packed sci-fi thriller.
Director Paul Johansson of One Tree Hill has decided to tackle the monumental individualist novel with a cast of unknown character actors and a production design mentality of a Saturday afternoon Hallmark Channel made-for-T.V. movie.
Though it will be up to American and international audiences to decide whether or not the film will be successful, the trailer makes the film look like Unstoppable meets The Tourist but with the budget of one episode of a SyFy original series. Who is John Galt? We don’t remember, but we’re sure he probably doesn’t want to see this movie.
Jane Eyre
Coming to select theaters March 11

Mia Wasikowska must be tired of dressing in frills.
Jane Eyre, the novel. Creative Commons
With her first breakout cinematic role as Alice in Tim Burton’s reimagining of Alice in Wonderland, Wasikowska once again plays a charming British and bookish girl in director Cary Fukunaga’s rendition of the Charlotte Bronte coming of age story.
With a solid supporting cast, including Judi Dench and Jamie Bell, as well as a trailer that presents the movie version as a gripping dramatic version of the Bible-thick English class standby, this film version might appeal to a wider audience than just Anglophiles.
Red Riding Hood
Coming to theaters March 11

A sordid-looking mashup of an ubiquitous tale designed to warn children about suspicious strangers, Little Red Riding Hood, directed by Twilight-famed Catherine Hardwick, employs the same intrigue of the sexy, seductive and serial killer werewolf. Starring the usually adorable or ditzy Amanda Seyfried (Mean Girls), this bloody teen movie seems like Sleepy Hollow meets Vampire Diaries.
