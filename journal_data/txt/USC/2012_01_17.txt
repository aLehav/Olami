The Department of American Studies and Ethnicity will officially begin partnering with Kaya Press this semester with the opening of its office in Kaprielian  Hall.
Edit ready · Kaya Press Publisher Sunyoung Lee makes edits to a book in her office in Kaprielian Hall. Kaya Press will partner with USC for the next five years. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
 
Kaya Press, which only prints books from Asian and Pacific Island diasporas, plans to give USC students a hands-on experience in book publishing.
Sunyoung Lee, the company’s editor and publisher, said one of the reasons Kaya Press moved from New York to USC was because of the strength of the programs focusing on Asia and the Pacific Islands.
“We’re in Los Angeles because we had an opportunity to come out to USC, a dream for any independent literary press,” Lee said. “USC’s interest in becoming the premier university of the Asia Pacific age seemed like a perfect fit for Kaya Press in particular. We’re very much looking forward to contributing to USC’s emerging profile as a powerhouse in this area.”
The five-year contract with the university means students can become involved with a fully operational literary publishing company with the actual processes of acquiring, putting together and publicizing books.
Jennifer Reynolds-Kaye, a graduate student studying art history, has worked as a graduate assistant for Kaya Press since the start of the fall semester. Reynolds-Kaye said her work with the company doesn’t specifically intersect with her dissertation at the moment, but working at Kaya Press has taught her about publishing.
“It’s a very vibrant, creative atmosphere, and it’s really great to have that opportunity, especially while I’m in grad school, to have that as part of what you do every day,” Reynolds-Kaye said. “It’s a very exciting place, and we want it to be a hub of creativity of students at USC.”
Fiona Wang, a junior majoring in business administration and accounting, has been working as a project specialist for Kaya Press since October. She said the enthusiasm of Kaya Press’ workers impressed her.
“I’d never worked for a non profit before,” Wang said. “It’s a different kind of passion people have. They’re not working for money — they’re working so hard because they love this.”
Nicole Saeun Schildkraut, a graduate student studying English, said she has been working with Kaya Press for two years to publish her collection of poetry, The Magnetic Refrain.
“Students who are interested in publishing would learn a great deal by working with them,” Schildkraut said. “It’s very hands-on, from the very beginning of signing offers all the way up to publishing them and creating publicity.”
Authors whose books Kaya Press has published have received awards such as the American Book Award and the Association for Asian-American Studies Book Award.
Lee said the books she publishes fix misconceptions about Asian storytelling.
“By publishing only works from the Asian and Pacific diasporas, we’re hoping to showcase the innovation and diversity that can be found there,” Lee said. “[Our authors] are not trying to represent, so much as they are trying to bust through presumptions about the kinds of stories that Asian-Americans or Asian-Australians or Asian-Africans or Asian-Latin-Americans have to tell.”
Viet Nguyen, a professor of American studies and ethnicity, said his department is concerned with the ways ethnic and racial populations in the United States are shaped globally by histories and events and how the United States impacts the rest of the world.
“[The ASE department is] at the forefront of American studies and ethnic studies … because so many of its faculty and students are working on transnational and international issues,” Nguyen said.
Kaya Press plans to unite Asian and Pacific writers in Los Angeles by working to establish an organization like New York’s Asian American Writers’ Workshop, a non-profit arts organization that supports the creating, publishing, developing and disseminating of creative writing by Asian-Americans.
“Despite the enormous diversity of culture and experiences in Los Angeles, it doesn’t have any kind of Asian-American, much less Asian, diasporic, literary organization,” Lee said. “We [Kaya Press] hope to remedy that situation.”
Kaya Press plans to hold its launch party in Kaprielian Hall room 445 at 5 p.m. on Thursday. The event will feature readings by Kaya Press authors, including Sesshu Foster, Catherine Liu, Samantha Chanse and Nicole Schildkraut.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety daily incident log between Friday, Jan. 13 and Monday, Jan. 16.
Crimes against property
At 12:21 p.m. on Jan. 13, a student reported that her ex-boyfriend, a former student, entered her apartment at Regal Trojan Arms without permission and while she was attempting to get him to leave he removed her debit card from her bedroom without her knowledge. Later, the student reported that her ex-boyfriend sent her a photo that showed her debit card cut in pieces.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 2:39 p.m. on Jan. 16, DPS officers responded to a student who reported that a pot of cooking oil caught fire on the stove in her apartment at Cardinal Gardens. The student had removed the pot from the stove and extinguished the fire before the officers arrived and they confirmed that it was out. There was no structural damage to the apartment, but the kitchen walls and ceiling were blackened by smoke.
at 4:07 p.m. on Jan. 15, DPS and LAPD officers responded to a report of a student setting a T-shirt on fire in front of Cardinal Gardens and detained him for investigation. The DPS officers extinguished the fire and a witness positively identified the student as the person who started it. LAPD officers arrested the student and transported him to S/W station, but he was released without being booked and the matter was referred to Judicial Affairs instead.
AT 6:15 P.M. on Jan. 13, DPS officers responded to a report of a male and a female yelling at each other at the location and detained them for questioning. The male identified himself as a student and stated that he was in an argument with his girlfriend. Both parties stated that the dispute was verbal only and the officers cleared the scene after observing no signs of injury to either of them.

The Dept. of Public Safety will be informing students of familiar and forgotten safety tips at the Annual Campus Safety and Emergency Preparedness Fair on Trousdale Parkway today.
The fair gives various law enforcement and crime prevention organizations on campus and in Los Angeles the opportunity to teach new students security techniques, said DPS Capt. David Carlisle.
“Every year we see almost 3,000 new students that have to be trained after they have moved away from home,” Carlisle said. “Students that have been here a while know about smart behavior and what to do in an event of an emergency, but we have to educate the new people.”
Michael Chapey, a sophomore majoring in narrative studies, said he wouldn’t be fully prepared if a crisis were to occur.
“I don’t really have any plans in an emergency like a fire or earthquake,” Chapey said. “Although we do have many fire drills in Troy, so we’ll know what to do in an evacuation.”
The fair will also teach students what protocol must be followed during fires and natural disasters, said DPS officer Wyman Thomas.
“We will be providing safety kits in the event of an emergency, especially since this is earthquake territory,” Thomas said. “The kits will include a flashlight, Band-Aids, batteries and small essential things that you can keep in a locker or your car.”
Alex Cerone, a sophomore majoring in business and cinematic arts, said in most situations a student’s choices can prevent crime.
“The further away from campus you get, there’s less of a DPS presence,” Cerone said. “Students also have to be taking it upon themselves and asking how they can protect themselves.”
Even though most returning students are aware of ways to prevent crime, the fair will remind them that safety is invaluable, Thomas said.
“Students often prioritize their classes, getting their assignments done and also the social component outside of the classroom,” Thomas said. “Safety becomes really low on the totem pole and we want people to know that safety is first.”

USC Hospitality has changed the hours that hot food buffets operate in EVK Restaurant and Grill and The Parkside Restaurant — a change stirring mixed reactions among students.
Food for all · EVK Restaurant and Grill and The Parkside Restaurant have changed the hours of their hot food buffet in response to student traffic. Lunch and dinner are served continuously until 8:45 p.m. - Daily Trojan file photo
 
Though Parkside and EVK will remain open until 10 p.m., hot food, with a few exceptions including pizza and soup, will not be served after 8:45 p.m. The dining halls will no longer close for 30 minutes between lunch and dinner, as in previous semesters.
The dining halls will still close from 10:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., between breakfast and lunch.
Before making the change, USC Hospitality analyzed when students typically eat at the dining halls and meet with groups of students.
“We tracked when students come and looked at the traffic patterns for [a monthly period] and for [a yearly period],” Director of USC Hospitality Kris Klinger said. “We also met with students in focus groups, student government and residential student government and asked them questions.”
Sawyer Coleman, an undeclared freshman, said he thinks students will be irritated by the change since they tend to eat late meals.
“It’s a little frustrating because I feel like a lot of college students are hungry after 8:45 [p.m.] and without hot food, there is no real incentive to eat at EVK,” Coleman said.
Klinger said the change was in response to students who had communicated a desire to extend dining hours, many of whom said they appreciate the changed hours.
“I like [the new schedule],” said Jennifer Camello, a freshman majoring in anthropology. “I always eat early anyway. I like to get a snack between 3:30 and 4 [p.m.] so I’m glad it’s open then.”
Thierry Bourroux, the associate director of USC Hospitality for residential operations, said although the change has received negative feedback, he has received more positive comments on the quality of the food being served.
Klinger said Bourroux, who joined USC Hospitality in May 2011, has worked to provide fresher entrées in the dining halls.
“We got feedback from students who are not happy because they like to have a late dinner,” Bourroux said. “But we have a lot of good feedback from the students who appreciate the food we are serving today.”
Klinger said that he and Bourroux continue to meet with students in an effort to make sure USC Hospitality addresses their concerns.
“We appreciate what the students have shared with us and we are taking it into consideration,” Klinger said.
Richard Mattox, a freshman majoring in narrative studies, said the new hours makes him more inclined to spend his own money at other off-campus venues, such as Wendy’s or Chick-fil-A.
“My main time to come is between 8 [p.m.] and 10 [p.m.],” Mattox said. “This change makes me less likely to go here to buy food and more likely to buy food somewhere else and use my own money.”
The grill station in EVK will also stay open on the weekends during lunch and dinner. By the end of the month, USC Hospitality hopes to have smoothie bars set up in both dining halls.
No questions to staff about how this will impact them?
No questions to the admin about it, either?

Despite splitting up this weekend, the women’s tennis team found success in Palm Springs, Calif., and Las Vegas with junior Danielle Lao and freshman Zoe Scandalis each taking home the singles title in their respective tournament.
In Las Vegas at the Freeman Memorial, Scandalis ran the table to bring home the championship, taking down three top-70 players, including two top-10-ranked Pac-12 rivals.
Getting served · Junior Danielle Lao won the singles title at the Freeman Memorial in Las Vegas. The squad is ranked 16th nationally. - Daily Trojan file photo
 
The freshman dismantled UCLA’s Robin Anderson, the nation’s No. 8 singles player, in straight sets in the semifinals.
Once in the title game, Scandalis faced what could easily be the greatest challenge of her short USC career thus far in Stanford’s Mallory Burdette. Burdette was a doubles All-American and paired with Hilary Barte to win NCAA doubles championship last year. This year, Burdette was the country’s top-ranked singles player coming into this weekend.
Scandalis roared back from an early 6-7 defeat in the first set to steal the second game in a 7-6 (5) tiebreaker that seemed to sap all the energy out of Burdette. Scandalis finished off her Pac-12 rival with a 6-3 victory in the third set, defeating the top two seeds in the last two rounds.
On top of Scandalis’ day in the singles department, fellow freshman Sabrina Santamaria paired with sophomore Kaitlyn Christian, who bowed out before the quarterfinals of the singles bracket after a loss to Anderson, as the second seed in the Freeman Memorial. As the No. 3 doubles team in the country, the duo advanced to the final match after Christian exacted some revenge on a UCLA squad that featured Anderson, making their personal record even at 1-1 on the day.
In the finals, the UCLA pair of Pamela Montez and Courtney Dolehide, who ranks 23rd nationally, were too much for Christian and Santamaria, as the duo fell 8-4. Despite the loss, USC coach Richard Gallien has much to be excited about, especially with the high level of play he is getting from the younger team members.
The Women of Troy seemed to have rivaled Stanford’s number all day and besides Scandalis’ take down of the Cardinal’s two singles players, the team of Scandalis and junior Valeria Pulido upset the tandem of Burdette/Nicole Gibbs 8-3 in the quarterfinals.
In La Quinta, Calif., Lao took down Virginia’s Emily Frasor in straight sets, 7-6 (5), 6-0, to win the National Collegiate Tennis Classic. Lao not only defeated Fraser, but she beat Virginia’s Li Xi in a three-set thriller in the semifinal match.
In the doubles bracket, senior Alison Ramos paired with Lao to make it all the way to the final match only to fall 8-6 to the Virginia duo Fraser and Xi, who exacted some revenge on Lao after their loss in the singles tournament.
As the younger team members gain more game experience, the high expectations for this team are that much closer to being reached.
Great Teams like Women of Troy Racquet Babes…..make their hard work worthwhile.
Stay with this exciting team of women as they improve with experience and claim the tough pac-12
title.
Fight On!
See you on the Courts.

Three other premier men’s tennis teams showed up to compete at the four-day Sherwood Collegiate Cup in Thousand Oaks, but No. 1 USC ensured that they could go home a little early.
Aces · The Trojans are the top team in the country due in large part to Ray Sarmiento (above). USC has won three straight national titles. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
In a tournament dominated by Trojans, senior Steve Johnson took home his first collegiate title since the 2011 NCAA singles championship after defeating fellow Trojan senior Daniel Nguyen 6-2, 6-2 on Monday.
Ten Trojans participated in a 32-player singles draw and 16-team doubles draw. By the third day of the tournament, every player from No. 5 Baylor, No. 6 Stanford and No. 9 UCLA had been eliminated from play except a pair of Baylor Bears that eventually lost in the doubles semifinal round.
Despite falling to Johnson in the singles final, Nguyen still walked away victorious by joining forces with USC sophomore Ray Sarmiento to defeat teammates Johnson and Freshman Yannick Hanfmann in a tight 9-7 victory in the doubles title match.
“You always want to beat [Johnson] when you go up against him, but he looked unbelievable out there,” Nguyen said.
Johnson, No. 1 in the tournament and No. 1 in the International Tennis Association rankings, starts his return to collegiate action with a perfect 5-0 singles record after taking the fall semester off to train on the professional circuit.
In the all-USC singles final four, Johnson defeated sophomore Emilio Gomez 6-1, 6-4, while Nguyen beat his doubles partner Sarmiento 6-2, 6-2 to advance to the final round.
“For me, it’s a lot harder to play against a teammate,” Sarmiento said. “I just have to take it like it’s another match, like I’m playing UCLA or Stanford.”
Sarmiento had no problems, however, defeating his teammates en route to his doubles title with Nguyen. After two convincing wins over teams from Stanford and Baylor, Sarmiento and Nguyen eliminated teammates Gomez and freshman Roberto Quiroz in a narrow 9-8 (2) victory before taking down Johnson and Hanfmann.
The tournament was the Trojans’ first action on the court since December, and it precedes the team’s opening spring season doubleheader against Loyola Marymount and UC Santa Barbara at Marks Stadium on Jan. 21.
With so many Trojans making deep runs in singles and doubles draws, the team is confident in its depth and its potential to capture its fourth straight NCAA championship in the postseason.
“Our team is really good from bottom up,” Nguyen said. “It’s definitely one of the stronger teams I’ve been on.”
Way to go 3PETE Smith NCAA Champs!!!! Glad to see you guys again.
Being at the NCAA Finals in Stanford Tennis Stadium watching our Trojans win their 3rd straight was
Super Special.  Come out and Support this team and these SUPER DUDES
& Coaches who make us all proud.  This is an incredible TEAM and the Matches are fun & Exciting.

History lessons have a way of awakening the details that get lost in the depths of sports fans’ memories.
For instance, if you watched Alabama’s 21-0 drubbing of rival LSU in last week’s BCS National Championship Game, you should have felt a connection to the cardinal and gold.
No, junior quarterback Matt Barkley wasn’t slinging the football across the spacious Mercedes-Benz Superdome to  freshman receiver Marqise Lee or sophomore receiver Robert Woods;  junior Curtis McNeal wasn’t tearing off any long, back-breaking runs; and Nickell Robey wasn’t shrewdly patrolling the secondary. If they had, the game might have been more exciting.
But if not for USC’s fateful trip to Tuscaloosa in September 1970, the game of college football, the SEC and the 2011 Crimson Tide might not be what they are today.
Though the SEC is considered the belle of the ball when it comes to athletic excellence on the football field, the 1960s exposed a different side.
Despite winning  a nation-high 60 games, three national championships and four SEC regular season titles, there was not a single black player on the Tides’ roster.
While Bryant would apologize to his coaching staff following the 1966 season, no black players were offered scholarships over the next four years and only one black player was added to the freshman team.
As much as national championships and Heisman trophies contribute to the tradition of USC football, an unabashed openness to integrate should not be lost when discussing the history of the Trojans.
Dating back to 1925, with All-American Brice Taylor, USC has been known for playing the best players, regardless of race or creed. And that tradition was personified with the Heisman-esque careers of Mike Garrett and O.J. Simpson in the 1960s. USC was miles ahead of the integration curve before most schools, SEC or otherwise, realized the issue even existed.
The Trojans’ progressive thinking caught the attention of Bryant and before the 1970 season, he called legendary coach John McKay. The rest, as they say, is history.
Led by a backfield consisting of quarterback Jimmy Jones, running back Clarence Davis and fullback Sam “Bam” Cunningham, all of whom were black, McKay’s Trojans entered Legion Field on Sept. 12, 1970 looking not only to win a 60-minute football game, but to change the way people viewed the intersection between race and sport.
In front of a hostile crowd of 70,000-plus rabid Southerners, Cunningham stole the show with two touchdowns and 135 yards of total offense, en route to a 42-21 bashing of the Tide.
For Bryant, the devastating home defeat was really a win. Just as he had hoped, USC had silenced a crowd of incredibly narrow-minded fans and, in doing so, promoted the need for integration across all programs, regardless of geographical location or pervasive political ideologies.
Slowly but surely, the Crimson Tide would begin to offer scholarships and roster spaces to some of the top talent in the country, and over the next 40 years, the program would add six more national championships to its already remarkable resume.
To the average sports fan who goes perusing through old box scores on Wikipedia, the night of Sept. 12, 1970, appears as just another nonconference showdown, no different from LSU-Oregon this year or USC-Ohio State in 2009.
But that’s the beauty of a history lesson — sometimes you learn that 60 minutes between the lines can have the power to influence the next four decades of growth outside of it.

Pretty good article on how things changed for college football in the South because of coach Bryant and the USC Trojans.  It is amazing that  only 60 years ago the civil rights movement was in its infancy and now we are hard pressed to find such overt discrimination in this country.  The US is still evolving as is college football.  Thanks to those that make our country great and those that have made college football what it is today.
If you would do a bit of research you would know that Wilbur Jackson was the first African-American scholarship player at Alabama. He was a freshman in 1970 when USC played bama.
David,
A great article.  I recommend that you invite people to view the movie “Breaking the Huddle” which highlights the history you relate here!

Dave,
What a great article… You are absolutely right. We look at today’s players and assume they have all always been eligible to play.  As you point out, that is not so…I’ve written a lot about the color line in baseball and had wondered about it in football so thanks for writing this.

On Sunday night, USC was presented with an opportunity to upend UCLA in front of a season-high crowd of 8,474 at the Galen Center. Instead, the Trojans lost their sixth straight game in blowout fashion, 66-47. The loss dropped USC to 5-13 overall and 0-5 in Pac-12 play. The Trojans shot a dismal 18-50 (36 percent) from the floor and were outrebounded by the Bruins 44-19.

“We’re struggling to score, obviously, it’s been one of our problems all year,” coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We don’t make enough [shots].”
Only one Trojan, sophomore Maurice Jones, reached double figures with 13 points. Meanwhile, the Bruins got strong contributions from sophomore redshirt Travis Wear, senior Lazeric Jones, and sophomore redshirt David Wear, who poured in 19, 15, and 13 points respectively.
“I think [UCLA is] an ever-improving team,” O’Neill said. “It would appear to me that these guys have really started to move in the right direction as a group. They’ve got some weapons on the front line that are tough to deal with.”
Initially, the matchup between cross-town rivals was fairly competitive. USC jumped out to a 6-2 lead and found themselves tied with UCLA at 9-9 a little more than midway through the first half. The Bruins, however, went on a 28-10 run going into halftime and cruised the rest of the way for the victory.
“We have to give UCLA credit. They came out and played a great game and we didn’t match their energy,” freshman guard Alexis Moore said.
The Bruins (10-7, 3-2 in the Pac-12) shot a blistering 64 percent in the first half, helping them open up a big advantage. They only outscored USC by one point in the final twenty minutes, but it was too little, too late for the Trojans.
“Honestly, we embarrassed ourselves, we did a disservice to the university in our effort and how we played,” freshman guard Alexis Moore said.

Coach O’Neill was blunt about the state of his team, now losers of nine of their last ten games.
“We’ve been bit [sic] by this injury bug, combined with losing a couple of recruiting classes, we are what we are,” O’Neill said.
The “injury bug” most recently afflicted junior redshirt forward Aaron Fuller and junior center James Blasczyk, both of whom were unable to practice all week leading up to the game against UCLA. Even so, Coach O’Neill refused to make any excuses following the loss.
“What we’ve got to do is get back to work tomorrow, try to get better and move forward,” O’Neill said. “We obviously didn’t play well tonight.”
The lone bright spot for the Trojans came at halftime, when USC’s all-time leading scorer, Harold Miner, had his jersey retired by the university. Miner scored 2,048 points in three seasons (1989-1992) and was Sports Illustrated’s college basketball player of the year in 1992.
“[Miner’s] a great guy,” O’Neill said. “He’s a first-class individual in every way. I think it was an honor to have him back here.”
USC will travel to Oregon this week to take on the Ducks (13-5, 4-2) on Thursday and the Oregon State Beavers (11-7, 1-5) on Saturday. The Trojans know there is plenty of work to be done if they want to turn things around.
“Offensively, there’s still some things we need to work on,” Moore said. “But one thing we have tried to do is remain together as a team, because no one else is going to have our back except the guys in the locker room and the staff that works with us.”
This is all on coach O’Neill.  He smiles when he talks about the game because the team is essentially playing as he wants them to.  They play his defense, they play his “offense”.  They can’t or won’t shoot, won’t dunk, won’t do anything different.
I was optimistic when I heard about the hiring of Coach O’Neill, but his reputation for outrageous stubbornness, is out there for everyone to see.  I can’t imagine us winning any more games in 2012.

The Women of Troy endured a furious rally at the end of the first half to win a game that was not decided until the final seconds of regulation.
Block party · Freshman guard Ariya Cook looks to avoid a block by the Bruin’s Rebekah Gardner. Both teams shot under 30 percent for the game and played superb defense during the contest. The Trojans did not score a basket in the last four minutes. - Luciano Nunez| Daily Trojan
Senior guard Ashley Corral was not phased by the immense pressure. She coolly slipped the ball to Cassie Harberts for a layup in the closing minutes of the first half. That assist, the 414th of her career (she finished at 418), simultaneously tied her with USC legend Cheryl Miller in the record books for sixth in the school’s history and solidified USC’s position enough to take a lead into halftime in their 47-43 win.
Once the second half came, the frontcourt and rebounding, along with the aggressive USC defense, took over and propelled USC to a gritty victory over their crosstown rivals.
With a near triple-double of 10 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, Corral savored the victory.
“On the road, they’re one more step to our season … It’s a rivalry game, so everything’s going to be wild, it’s going to be energy that wins the game. I thought we executed a little bit better than they did and that’s what got us the win,” Corral said after the game. The Bruins had beaten the Women of Troy in their previous four encounters.
Corral tallied those eight record-list-climbing assists against only one turnover. Her superb ball handling was especially impressive in this low scoring affair.
There was intense defense on both sides as USC shot 29 percent and the Bruins shot 30 percent. Overall, the game was marked by sloppy play and scrappy defense.
The Women of Troy managed to out-rebound the Bruins 48-40. Harberts and freshman forward Alexyz Vaioletama both contributed 10 rebounds while Corral and junior forward Christina Marinacci contributed eight and seven.
The team’s defense throughout the season is the main reason USC is now 9-6. The defensive effort Saturday held the Bruins to only 18 second-half points.
The USC offense never really got into a rhythm in the second half and it struggled to build a lead on the foundation of their rock-solid defense. Its biggest second-half lead was 43-38 with four minutes remaining, showing how close the game remained despite the defensive success. By the end of the game Corral was the only one who managed to break double digits for the Women of Troy with 10 points.
The Bruins cut USC’s lead to 44-43 with 23 seconds left, and the game was tense down the stretch. But Harberts coolly drained three crunch-time free throws to seal the win for the Women of Troy.
Corral explained the team’s defensive strategy after the game.
“We’ve been focusing on our defense week in and week out … We wanted to focus on keeping the ball out of their stars’ hands, and I thought we did a very good job of executing,” Corral said.
The team hopes to continue its good run of play this week when they host Oregon on Thursday and Oregon State on Saturday at the Galen Center. If its defense keeps playing like it did against the Bruins, their odds of continuing their winning streak are pretty good.
nice to see Women of Troy playing tough D.
Lets get out & support them against Ducks & Beavers.
Cooper is instilling Team Defense at a high level.

After years of smash hit collaborations and remixes, it’s amazing that Steve Aoki has never released his own album.
Aoki, an icon in the electronic music world, is best known for his signature locks, facial hair and riotous live performances. His seminal track “Warp” has been a staple at college parties for years.

Wonderland, the new 13-track album from Aoki, has finally given the electronic phenomenon something to call his own.
Though this is Aoki’s first official studio album, Wonderland is filled to the brim with big-time collaborative artists. Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, LMFAO, Kid Cudi, Travis Barker and Lil Jon are just a few artists to join Aoki on this album. Taking a cue from the diverse collaborating artists, the album’s influences range from hard rock to pure pop to dirty dubstep.
The album begins with “Earthquakey People,” a collaboration with Rivers Cuomo. This  endlessly dance-enducing, electro-groove track comes off  surprisingly as borderline rapping from Cuomo. “Earthquakey People” is downright funky, with a bright, poppy chorus that is pure fun, fueled by playful lyrics: Earthquakey people, jump around / ready to shake with the power of sound. Aoki constructs the track beautifully around Cuomo’s vocals, and it’s contagious.
Aoki follows this up with “Ladi Dadi (feat. Wynder Gordon),” which begins with some calm, Kaskade-esque grooving and seductive vocals from Gordon layered on top. The track gradually elevates to an unexpected dubstep-infused chorus. Aoki masterfully manipulates rhythm on this track, and the result is a blast that is epic and sophisticated.
Another standout track is “Emergency,” a collaboration with Lil Jon and Chiddy Bang. “Emergency” begins with Lil Jon yelling, This girl is so hot / it’s an emergency that I get her out of the club. Despite the stereotypical Lil Jon intro, the track continues with a solid rap by Chiddy Bang, which builds up to an absolutely epic chorus. Aoki brilliantly synthesizes melody, rhythm and Lil Jon into a banging chorus.
“Livin’ My Love” is one of the most popular tracks on Wonderland. The track is star-packed, featuring NERVO and LMFAO, and the song sounds a lot like something the latter would create. Aoki’s own influence is subtle here — Aoki purists will be disappointed. But with an addictive chorus and solid production, this song could certainly blow up into a party hit.
“Steve Jobs (feat. Angger Dimas)” pays tribute to the man who revolutionized DJing and music production with the hardware he created. The song begins with video game synth sounds building into a big house line, followed by a bass-infused, trance-esque chorus. This track is one that is sure to be remixed.
“Cudi the Kid” begins in typical Cudi style — dreamy and reflective — but Aoki smashes his way into the song with a hard, grinding chorus, backed by Travis Barker’s furious drumming. “Cudi the Kid” is an interesting collaboration that crosses several genres successfully, showing off Aoki’s versatility.
“Earthquakey People (The Sequel)” re-mashes the album’s initial poppy track into an electronic banger. Aoki mixes Cuomo’s vocals into several haunting, frenetic buildups that crash down into a hard-hitting, synth-heavy chorus.
With a huge infusion of vocals and prominent collaborating artists, some critics have deemed Aoki too mainstream. Though this album certainly has a poppier feel to it, it’s a credit to Aoki that he can fuse so many different styles and artists into one album while maintaining its relevancy. Aoki is “mainstream” in the sense that he’s at the forefront of the electronic music movement, not because of his lack of originality or mimicry.
Wonderland is not just Aoki’s first album — it is literally a wonderland, an album chock-full of an amazing variety of genre-mashing, collaboration-infused grooving. It’s a stellar “first” album effort, one sure to solidify and extend the reign of one of electronic music’s foremost kings.

For years, the restaurant industry has trended toward wholesome dining: locally sourced foods with rustic presentations. The effect is meant to comfort the diner through “organic” eating, a reminder of a simpler era of literal farm-to-table meals that most diners have probably not experienced.
And nothing gets much more wholesome, or comforting, than a true home-cooked meal.
Many recent events in the past year have welcomed the revival of the home cook: the dramatic makeover of Bon Appetit magazine, the Food Network’s ever-growing catalogue of cooking shows and the Food52 Cookbook — a published tome from the ultimate home-cooking blog.
Perhaps most indicative of this trend, ABC’s The Chew is a daytime talk show that began airing for those who prefer chef Mario Batali to talk-show host Nate Berkus.
Yes, Americans are spending a lot of time in their kitchens. And they’re doing so with the intention of making quality food.
For the college student, it’s never too early or late to get out the pots and pans. An evening of cooking is, if done properly, as rewarding as any restaurant meal.
But where to start? For students who do not often find themselves in the kitchen, it’s important to first overcome the intimidation that can come with the thought of cooking.
I would know; I was intimidated too, never wanting to go near a stove.
At 14 years old, I began my first foray into cookery with a brown sugar explosion in my microwave. Deterred by the frightening sound and the impossibility of cleaning up the sticky mess, I stayed away from cooking appliances for the next few years. When I finally returned, I did so with the intention of making everything “semi-homemade.”
Gripe all you want about Sandra Lee’s show Semi-Homemade Cooking, her lowbrow tastes, Stepford Wives appearance and her amusingly insulting Kwanzaa cake. The lady is onto something novel with her approach to everyday cooking.
Her use of some prepared, store-bought components along with fresh ingredients in a meal is a wonderful introduction to the world of cooking for those who might be new to it.
Available at most supermarkets and certainly online, flavored pasta is a great purchase. A chili-flavored linguine pairs well with shrimp. A green-olive-flavored version will do wonders with spinach-and-feta chicken sausage, as it did on a recent weekday night at my apartment. This pasta is a pantry item that’s simple to cook and will do half of the work for you with its flavor.
If inspiration and time are of the essence, purchase prepared side dishes. Whole Foods Market currently features a spicy eggplant dish that would be excellent with a quickly seared chop of meat.
Another tip: Invest in one great spice you know you will use time and time again. Smoked paprika, a type of chili powder available at most specialty food stores, is a personal favorite. I discovered it while making paella, a famous Spanish rice dish, but it can instantly transform meat, fish or grain with an earthy heat worthy of a Southern barbecue.
The beginning of the year is the perfect time to re-examine the pantry, and a complex spice is the right way to start restocking.
Still don’t think getting into the kitchen is worth it?
I made dinner for my roommates the other night — pork chops, braised in cider vinegar, with cabbage, carrots and fingerling potatoes.
They returned the favor by cleaning the entire apartment.
That’s motivation enough to tie on an apron.

But a handful of foreign films have been traveling film festival circuits and are now being released in the United States to critical acclaim.
It has indeed been a prolific year for foreign filmmakers. There have been features from all corners of the world, and many have something in common: They focus on the power of human emotion, a characteristic these filmmakers hope will attract audiences from around the world regardless of their respective languages.
In a panel discussion at the Egyptian Theatre on Saturday, directors of foreign language films nominated at the Golden Globes spoke about their work.
The discussion included Angelina Jolie, Pedro Almodóvar, Asghar Farhadi, Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne.
Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne shared the Grand Prix award at the Cannes Film Festival with fellow filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan for films The Kid with a Bike and Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, respectively.
The Dardenne brothers are known for films rooted in the styles of naturalism and realism and have been working together their entire careers.
“Alone, we can’t do anything,” Jean-Pierre  Dardenne said.
The Dardenne brothers explained that the final moments in The Kid with a Bike  highlight the notion that “love is stronger than death, sometimes … and for a short time.”
Pedro Almodóvar, who boasts a stylistic approach bolder than that of the Dardenne brothers, claimed his interests lie outside of the subtlety of naturalism. “I want to represent feelings,” the Spanish filmmaker said. In his film, The Skin I Live In, he tackles issues of sex, gender and identification with expressive techniques.
In response to the success of 2011’s The Artist, a black-and-white silent film, Almodóvar said he couldn’t imagine making a film without words, considering how talkative he and his fellow Spaniards are. Almodóvar also admitted he has flirted with the possibility of leaving his homeland for a film and shooting in the United States, though he has reservations.
“I don’t think the production system of this town really fits me,” he said.
Iran’s most famous film of the year, A Separation, is impressive in that it was made with an $800,000 budget. The film also has been receiving acclaim since the Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Golden Bear.
“[A Separation is] a detective story, but the detective is actually the audience,” Farhadi said.
Later he explained that this decision allows the audience to become more involved in the film’s narrative.
A Separation is critical of Iranian culture yet largely universal in its themes — something that Farhadi said was inspired by the thematic tone of Akira Kurosawa’s seminal Rashômon.
“There’s an image of Iran outside of Iran which is not correct. I don’t mean to say that there are no issues or problems, but the types of problems that you often imagine are not the ones that are there,” Farhadi said.
He also said that people tend to forget the similarities shared by people of different nations.
“We look at the people of a country through the prism of politics,” Farhadi said.
The politics of another nation are explored in Angelina Jolie’s directorial debut, In the Land of Blood and Honey — a surprising departure for the famous actress. The love story is set during the Bosnian War and shot in two languages, Serbo-Croatian and English. Jolie explained this setting was chosen in hopes that the film would appeal to a wider demographic and would attempt to shed the language barrier most audiences seem to have a problem with.
Jolie also discussed her approach as a director in her first feature.
“The style for [In the Land of Blood and Honey] was dictated by the war. Some people say that [the] lighting was beautiful in some scenes, but there was no electricity. It wasn’t some genius move of mine,” Jolie said.
In speaking about the events that took place during the war, Jolie made her intentions clear with this film.
“We want people to talk about it. We want people to cry. We want the world not to forget about it,” Jolie said.
In a film industry that is swamped with remakes, sequels and ideas that can often feel uninspired, foreign-language films such as these and others offer a compelling alternative — that is, as long as audiences aren’t afraid of subtitles.

With the main Occupy L.A. encampment having come to an end, there are many questions regarding what it all meant — what it meant for the community and what it meant for similar movements striving for social change. The meaning and effects will take a long time to be clear.
Events like these need the perspective of hindsight to be fully understood and put into adequate context.
Some ancillary effects, however, are already becoming obvious.
In Skid Row, the Occupy Skid Row festival demonstrated the movement’s ability to inspire others.
Even more apparent is the physical effect Occupy L.A. had on City Hall. Several weeks of camped occupation have left the front lawn badly damaged.
The Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks has created a website for three proposed solutions to the City Hall lawn problem. Of the three, one actually shines: It fixes the damage and allows for further positive alterations.
The first plan would be to renovate the north lawn with decomposed granite and native plants. After the grass grows back, it would be essentially the same.
The second proposal, which has already won a straw poll in a neighborhood council meeting, suggests extensive incorporation of drought-resistant and water-saving plants into both lawns while maintaining a comparably sized lawn for events.
The third and most drastic plan entails the widespread planting of native plants, except in the paved walkways, and keeping the remaining lawn space scarce.
The second plan is the clear frontrunner. It can truly bring concrete, positive change in the wake of the eviction of the Occupy L.A. evictions on Nov. 30. The installation of drought-resistant plants — while maintaining the general configuration of the lawn — helps on two fronts.
First, it is sensitive to Los Angeles’ water shortages.
Of course, this is not saying that a few water-retaining plants are going to solve the problem, but every drop helps when the temperatures rise and the humidity plummets in the summer, and what better place to set an example like this than City Hall, the center of Los Angeles?
Second, the preservation of an open lawn helps send the message that, although Occupy L.A. was evicted, City Hall is by no means attempting to restrain the constitutionally given right to assemble, even in the same place that played host to what they probably saw as a nightmare during Occupy L.A.
By contrast, the first proposal ignores the possibility of improvement Rebuilding the lawn to its original set-up would be fine, and it’s certainly the safest option. The local neighborhood council has shown, however, that this can be seen as an opportunity.
The third proposal seems to take it to the other extreme, overhauling the configuration of the lawn and at the same time ignoring the double benefits of promoting water conservation and tacitly endorsing the right to assembly.
The second proposal must continue its path toward implementation. It makes an opportunity out of one of Occupy L.A.’s negative externalities.
For some time, the famous movement will be shrouded in ambiguity.
If this step forward can be taken by City Hall, however, then it could be said that, in a way, Occupy L.A. has already helped achieve one tangible improvement in the city — albeit not the intended one.

For most USC students, a new semester brings with it a new crop of professors, new classmates, new grading styles and new syllabi.
Let’s face it: You have most likely disagreed with some grades you’ve received in college. Whether it was on an essay, a project or a final grade, your frustration most likely resulted from what you felt was a discrepancy between the effort you put into your work and the letter grade you ended up with.
Subjective grading is an annoying fact of life at colleges in the United States and at USC — we might put in the same amount of effort for a class, but depending on the course, department or professor, our efforts could result in an “A” or a grade that’s subpar.
In certain countries, colleges implement more objective methods to make the grading process fairer for students. In Denmark, for example, multiple professors review each students’ work.
Though the fairness argument might win over many students to support objective grading practices, subjective grading could prepare us better for the realities of life after college.
To succeed in the professional world, people need to be adaptable and resourceful to meet the demanding needs of their superiors, co-workers and the ever-changing tasks at hand.
Similarly, to succeed in different classes with professors that have diverse standards in terms of what constitutes an “A” in their class, students must learn the same skills of adaptability and resourcefulness.
Students must adapt their writing or studying styles to meet the requirements and curricula of each class. They must collaborate with and learn from peers if the coursework is particularly difficult. They must be receptive to feedback from their professors or teaching assistants.
Additionally, developing a personal relationship with a professor or T.A. usually has a positive impact on a student’s performance in class. Though this practice is referred to by some as “sucking up,” the reality is that in the real world, building strong relationships and getting to know people matters. In many cases, it makes a much bigger difference than what’s on paper.
Group projects often elicit a number of groans from college students, as they can result in some of the most subjective grading practices because of varying commitment and work ethics of group members.
Teamwork, however, is an inevitable practice in the workplace, no matter what job or career students choose to pursue. If students can learn to work well in teams and with people from varying backgrounds, it will serve as a huge advantage for their success in the professional world.
Let’s say that USC were to adopt universally objective and standardized grading practices. For one thing, standardized tests that are graded very objectively —for example, only using Scantron or multiple-choice tests — are often not the best way to test complex concepts or theories common in areas such as liberal arts. In many cases, writing essays or working on research projects and theses are the best way for students to convey their knowledge and mastery of a subject.
In addition, the time-draining administrative changes on resources needed to implement multi-professor panel grading practices could detract from more important and valuable priorities that professors and teaching assistants need — such as developing and preparing courses and lectures, conducting research and advising and mentoring students.
This isn’t to say that objective grading policies are bad. In fact, in several cases, objectivity works and is implemented effectively at USC.
For example, a committee of professors, rather than a sole instructor, is responsible for grading Writing 340 final portfolios. For USC architecture students, final grades are assigned after a committee of five to seven professors reviews a portfolio of work that students have completed over the course of the semester.
If USC wants to adopt objective grading practices, a good place to start is with professors implementing standards to make grading more fair without sacrificing too much time — for example, using rubrics to evaluate essays rather than evaluating each essay as independent from one another.
On the other hand, subjective grading isn’t as bad as people make it out to be. It might not be fair, but neither is the world out there after college — students may just have to thank subjective grading for better preparing them.
 
Jasmine Ako is a senior majoring in business administration. 
The time and resources required to administer “objective grading” is exhausting. GPA deflation aka “curve” pressures professors to confer grades in a hurried manner, and alas this doesn’t always end up fair. This is why firms shouldn’t rely solely on GPA when conferring jobs or interns. Furthermore, it depends on one’s major. For STEM disciplines, I can’t see “subjective grading” going on. But for humanities BAs…there’s a lot of that happening. Play the game wisely, although GPA isn’t everything.

Los Angeles to San Francisco in two hours and 40 minutes; no plane ticket necessary. It sounds like a fantasy to the Bay Area student, whose only transportation alternative to an airplane is a six hour drive up the coast — and that’s without hitting L.A. traffic.
Kate Mock | Daily Trojan
 
But this fantasy might come true within the next few years, if the California High-Speed Rail Authority gets its way. The plan is to construct an electrically powered high-speed train system that traverses the trans-state route.
Unfortunately, many members of the state legislature plan to halt the plan’s progress. Republican state senators have united in opposition, and they have been joined by three Democrats.
These legislators must not ignore the will of the people.
If the system is built successfully, the project will represent a victory not only for the state of California, but also for the countless number of USC students who will benefit from it.
Plane tickets are expensive and airports are a hassle. Driving  can take away up to 12 hours of vacation time, and can be costlier than flying, especially if the itinerary includes renting a vehicle.
A train moving at 220 mph, however, has real potential. It offers USC students traveling home to the Bay Area much more flexibility.
And for anyone who needs a weekend trip to San Francisco, it provides a quick and reliable way to get there and eliminates concerns about finding parking.
Trains also provide a less stressful mode of transportation. On the tracks, there is no freeway construction or runway traffic. Comfortable seating, bathrooms, food and the lack of traditional airport security make train journeys even more appealing.
According to the Rail Authority, the ambitious project will create approximately 100,000 construction jobs each year the system is being built. Upon its completion, the rail’s operation and maintenance will create thousands more.
Businesses, restaurants and suppliers along the route should see an increase in clientele, expanding the need for employees even further.
The train also provides California with an opportunity for economic expansion in general. It would improve California’s infrastructure considerably, providing for the well-organized movement of people, goods and services. Corporate and government employees making frequent trips between California’s major metropolitan hubs would find the train convenient, increasing the efficiency of work-based travel.
The project does its duty for the environment too. The train’s electric power would be produced by sustainable resources, such as wind and solar power. These resources would help reduce the state’s chronic smog and air pollution. Greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on foreign oil would see similar decreases, as more people will choose the train over planes and automobiles.
High-speed rail systems worldwide have traditionally seen incredible success, from the TGV network in France to Japan’s Bullet Train. In both cases, revenues exceed operational costs. Traditionally, such systems are a sign of progress and adaptation in the modern world.
Some Californians have opposed the project due to the potential of having to move. But though the train will inconvenience some people, on a whole, the sacrifice is worth it.
Implementing one here would make California a national leader in transportation technology, infrastructure development and environmental initiative. And it would make our state a leader in satisfied citizenry as well.

I completely agree with this article because its true!  The only people that disagree are people who’s interests will be hit (for than likely financial interests) by the building out of this project.
We NEED it just as much as we NEED freeways and airports…  
William, your argument is tired and flowed…  Give it up already…
“Trojan” perfect you’re living in a rubber. Ignore the facts particularly if they run contrary to your argument: 1) As this thing has progressed it has become far more costly than the “people” were lead to believe and what those “people” authorized, so the “people” are increasingly unhappy with their decision2) It has become increasingly likely that, contrary to your prophylactic perspective, this won’t be cheap tickets unless it is heavily subsidized, 3) Further that it is not likely to be profitable or will even be able to meet its own operating costs even if the fares reflect the actual costs, 4) The 100,000 jobs are a fantasy and most of the jobs that are created won’t be here and of those that are here a large portion will be filled by workers from elsewhere, so its not likely to have a significant impact on CA unemployment, 5) It does not eliminate parking, how do you get to the damn thing, walk? You make this seem that is a panacea for all of California woes, far from that the drain on our economy will add to the problems we already face. 6)  This thing would have been great ½ a century ago, back when “people” like me started asking for it. This is when the systems in Europe and Japan were being constructed, but, as cool as I think these things are, I’m willing to say they aren’t the future, time and technology moved on.  It is likely that by the time this elephant is born it will be glowing white and obsolete. Technologies like automated driving, continuous recharging, and high speed electric powered cars and busses could quite easily provide a door-to-door service for a fraction of the cost and with much greater convenience, and efficiency, and that can directly reduce parking and traffic issues.These technologies, while nascent, are developing rapidly and could be integrated into the current system at far less cost and much more quickly than the million pound bullets. In fact the 100+ Billion dollars that the rail project will ultimately cost, just to get it up and running, would be best spent; helping to develop those technologies, upgrading, integrating, and modernizing our current mass transit system so that they really work and that includes air transport, ports,  and highway systems. What’s more, if the development programs were centered at subsidized R&D zones in the central valley that would boost local long term employment. In fact using the money for all of these programs and projects would increase jobs, provide real short and long term benefit to all the citizens of California and mean that “students” would have a much better chance of landing a real job in their chosen profession, jobs that would have a future. The only rail project that might have real legs and longevity in California, is a system to connect Los Angeles to Las Vegas and that would work only if the Nevada Nancy (Reid) could get the casino and hotel owners to pony up a substantial share of the actual construction cost. You’ll hear “experts” say that we can’t use the money for this because it’s earmarked and therefore we must build the HSR or lose the money, BS the fact is this is only legislation it can be changed far easier than getting the money back once we’ve converted it to concrete and sent it to Germany. By the way I’m a liberal and a Democrat.

A cynic might reject the recent explosion in American vinyl sales as a transient fad, as a short-lived parade of spendthrift hipsters getting their anachronistic rocks off. More than that, in this blessed age of sexy tech innovations like iPods and Spotify and Rock Band, to get one’s music from a clumsy crackly unwieldy turntable seems like some kind of blasphemy.
Here to the uninitiated, we explain that counterintuitive shift from digital to analog—four good reasons to go vinyl.                                                                                                                                                        
Album
Our musical tastes in the internet age are more schizophrenic than ever. The new platforms for music (e.g. YouTube, Pandora, Spotify) let us instantly jump between disparate songs by different artists, and so we think less in terms of albums and more in terms of songs. But an album is not merely a collection of songs; through track ordering and thematic connections (or, as in concept albums like The Wall or Hospice, even an overarching story arc), the artist creates meaning via the album’s structure. And the turntable format encourages us to appreciate that full-album experience.
Art
Album art, frequently beautiful in its own right (e.g., “In the Aeroplane Over the Sea”) and occasionally iconic (e.g., “Abbey Road”), is almost always intended for the larger canvas provided by record covers. CD inserts and iTunes previews, each a wimpy reproduction of the record cover’s large-scale greatness, inevitably do injustice to the original visual beauty of the album.
Audio
The music industry implemented CDs as a standard in the 80s, replacing vinyl, and today we tend to look back on that as an evolutionary progression: more portability (eventually into the infinite, with the advent of CD-reading computers), and none of those irksome crackles and hisses that LPs accumulate from long-term usage. Yet in fact most audiophiles prefer vinyl. Digitization is necessarily a reduction, simplifying sound into discrete pieces of data (“bits”) that a computer can then translate back into sound waves. Analog audio never undergoes this packing-unpacking process and is therefore more pure.
Artists
To fight music piracy is to attack an ocean with one’s fists. No matter how hard we may try, it simply will not go away. Buying on the old vinyl format (rather paradoxically) is a more realistic response to the new music landscape. This makes sense in light of the recent vinyl boom: Whereas most of the industry’s profits are shrinking due to internet piracy, vinyl is inherently resistant to online distribution (i.e., is desirable precisely for its tangibility) and therefore vinyl sales are going up. By fostering this vinyl marketplace, we give desperate artists a chance to survive, finally a format to rely on amid flagging digital methods.

Last week, I discussed tilt-shift—an emerging trend in video that makes real-life footage seem cartoonish.  This week, I’ll be talking about time-lapse, another popular trend in film today.
The time-lapse process is a style that allows us to view life in a different way—an entire sunset, a whole day or even weeks can be seen within the course of a minute.  A time-lapse video basically shows the world appearing to move in fast forward.  Time appears to be moving faster, and thus, lapsing.
Processes, movements and patterns that would otherwise appear subtle to the eye become much more pronounced.  In a time-lapse video, the movement of stars is visible and clouds can appear to become an ocean.  Time-lapse videos are inherently captivating, and can be seen all over in TV shows, films and videos.
Time-lapse videos are created by slowing down the process of capturing video and taking fewer images over a longer period of time.  Cameras are designed to capture a set number of images per second (usually around 24-30 frames per second), but in a time-lapse video one image per second is usually the standard.  This lower rate of frames per second is what creates the illusion of reality being in fast-forward.
Shooting a time-lapse video is fairly simple—all you’ll need is the appropriate camera (DSLRs are very popular for time-lapse), a tripod and a subject.  It’s amazing and fun to see the patterns that can emerge from seemingly mundane daily scenes, such as a traffic jam or a crowded city block.  Be sure to film your subject(s) for at least one hour.
The time-lapse process is very popular right now, and the Internet is chock-full of amazing time-lapse videos.  Inspiration is just a few clicks away, and the possibilities for time-lapse videos are nearly infinite.  The technique is uncovering the hidden patterns in everyday life.
