Walking into “Making Mammy: A Caricature of Black Womanhood, 1840-1940,” the viewer is first confronted with a bright red polka-dotted head wrap in the middle of a dark, low-lit room — a piece of clothing associated with the historical representation of a “mammy.”
With that piece and others, the California African American Museum’s exhibit showcases artwork representing how modern-day stereotypes of Black women came to develop in the United States. 
When discussing the conception of the exhibit, assistant curator Taylor Blythewood-Porter said that she and previous Curator of History Tyree Boyd-Pates were going through CAAM’s main collection and noticed a lot of racist memorabilia, which sparked a conversation over why the items were created, who they serve and who they hurt. 
“We were able to organize and put [the art] into different categories, such as film, dolls, domestic items, and from there we were really able to see how stereotypes and their power are really being disseminated through various different types of marketing and entertainment,” Blythewood-Porter said of the curation process.
The exhibit focuses on the mammy stereotype, which is a caricature of an older Black woman who is overweight, sassy, typically dark-skinned, desexualized and entrenched in supposedly-pleasant servitude to white families, according to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia. It’s a stereotype that has historically limited society’s conceptions of a Black woman’s capabilities and depth. She takes care of another’s family, keeps its children in line and finds fulfillment in her work.
Other pieces included photos, posters, kitchen supplies and books. Perhaps the most compelling part of the exhibit, the film portion included excerpts from movie “Gone with the Wind,” a racist children’s cartoon called “Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat,” a minstrel short and the 1915 version of the pro-Ku Klux Klan movie “The Birth of a Nation.” Each exhibited different, often false, representations of the Black experience, with an emphasis on womanhood. 
The exhibit is somewhat limited to a relatively small, dark room with many physical pieces, but not to its detriment — Bythewood-Porter and Boyd-Pates chose the artwork carefully and effectively. The breadth of mediums represented amplifies the separate pieces, as each is impactful in its uniqueness and rarity. 
One such piece is an original copy of a program from the White House’s first screening of the “The Birth of a Nation,” which was largely perceived as a governmental endorsement of white supremacy, according to the History Channel. Because of this isolation, the intimate space clearly illuminates the issue of Black people’s portrayal in the media throughout history, as well as how these portrayals still permeate popular culture today. 
Naomi Neal, a visitor experience associate at the Museum of African Diaspora in San Francisco, praised the exhibit’s ability to make its audience realize how normalized these stereotypes have become in society.
“I’ve seen [mammy portrayals] a lot within the studies in the field that I work in, but for a lot of people it may not be as simple as seeing it until you’re in an exhibition where it’s completely dedicated to a mammy, and then some people, it may dawn on them like, ‘Oh, that was a mammy portrayal,’” Neal said, also referencing modern movies with evolved portrayals of the mammy figure such as “The Help” and “Hidden Figures.”
According to Blythewood-Porter, the mammy figure did not actually exist during slavery: She would not have been overweight, as many slaves were malnourished; she would not have been dark-skinned if she were working inside of the home; and she would have not been older, as usually younger women took care of white children. 
This manipulation of history served two main purposes. The first was that Southern white women felt more comfortable with having an older, non-sexualized servant in their home to assuage their anxieties of their husbands being unfaithful — fears that developed from the long history of sexual abuse between white male enslavers and enslaved young Black women.
The second purpose for the creation of the amiable mammy is the American South’s effort to keep pro-slavery sentiments alive.
“After the Civil War, it was like the Southerners’ kind of push for good PR, like, ‘Oh, slavery wasn’t all that bad,” Blythe-Porter said. “Look, mammy’s with us, she stayed. She stayed with the family. She stayed with the home,’”
Although such falsehoods served white oppressors, they were the breeding grounds for one-dimensional stereotypes of Black women seen today, she added. 
Saidi Foster, a father attending CAAM with his son, appreciated how the exhibit brought awareness of these stereotypes’ origins, as these portrayals were a white-dominated populace’s only understanding of the Black experience.
“I think it’s important, Foster said. “I think it helps bring an awareness of … how people thought of African Americans — how they saw them and how they were portrayed in the media back then.”
Neal’s mother, Sileia Neal, appreciated the exhibit for challenging the media’s distorted and dehumanizing representations of minority characters. She spoke from her own growth as a Latinx woman who was once unfamiliar with Black culture, as many Latin American cultures she’s familiar with have track records of erasing their Black history. Through familial connections, she made active efforts to learn about this history, which opened her eyes to the many ways in which Black people are discriminated against and fundamentally misunderstood. 
“That’s a student, that’s a young man, that’s a woman, that’s somebody’s child … that could be the next scientist,” Neal said.
Blythewood-Porter shared the same sentiment and said the exhibit asks visitors to reflect on the Black women they know who are individually successful, such as doctors and lawyers, and how we can redefine our broad understanding of the spectrum of women’s work.
Ultimately, she said, the exhibit is about reclaiming what it means to be a Black woman in the United States: taking ownership over a detrimental historical narrative and forming a widespread sense of self-esteem to empower and redefine future generations.
“There’s been a lack of self-love and worthiness [among Black women],” Blythewood-Porter said. “And I think that with this exhibition, it’s being able to take more agency and ownership over that.”

When students learned the University was suspending its overseas programs in China due to fears of coronavirus contagion, they were left uncertain of their next steps. Classes at the University had already begun, so the would-be study abroad students could choose between returning to Los Angeles and joining classes three weeks into the semester or taking a semester-long leave of absence.
On Jan. 30, the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 4 travel advisory for China, warning people to stop all travel to China, due to the life-threatening risk from the coronavirus outbreak. All major airlines will be canceling flights to China beginning next week. The University, which cancels international programs at a Level 3 travel advisory, emailed students enrolled in the China programs last week to inform them of the cancellation and list alternative options.
Sean O’Connell, director of the International Business Program at the Marshall School of Business, said the cancellation of overseas programs in China was based on the University’s policy against sending students to countries with travel alerts.
“USC does not send students to any countries where there is a Level 3 or Level 4 travel warning,” O’Connell said. “That’s the University policy, so we had to immediately suspend those programs.”
O’Connell said universities in China had a late start date for the spring semester that began after Chinese New Year, which was on Jan. 25 this year, and which is why students in Marshall’s international exchange programs hadn’t arrived in China before the program was canceled.
“[Universities in China] do not start classes until after Chinese New Year,” O’Connell said. “None of the students were attending classes or starting classes at [Peking University] or Fudan, where we have our exchange programs.”
O’Connell said the University has offered a few options for the students in the overseas programs in China: coming back to school or taking a leave of absence.
“The students either chose to come here back to school or they went on leave of absence for the semester,” O’Connell said. “Because last Friday was the last day to drop and add [classes], and this happened at the beginning of the week, they were able to get into classes here.”
The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences declined to comment further on the options for students enrolled in the China study abroad programs.
Jessica Zhai, a senior majoring in communication, was a part of Dornsife’s Council on International Education Exchange program in Beijing that got canceled. She said she chose to take a gap semester and stay at home in China because she would have to make up for the missing assignments and lectures from the past three weeks.
“I just think that it’s hard for me to catch up,” Zhai said. “Currently, I have a very high GPA, so I do not want to jeopardize my GPA at all.”
Zhai also said the possibility of getting infected with the coronavirus on the flight back to the United States drove her not to go back to school.
“I don’t want to travel back because of potential risk,” Zhai said. “My friends who went back to their countries often tell me that the next flight landed has people already infected.”
Zhai said she understands the University’s decision to cancel classes due to safety concerns, but since she was already in China, she wants the school to manage student cases on an individual basis.
“It’s really awkward or difficult for students like me who [are] in China currently and the program got canceled,” Zhai said. “They’re very worried about our safety, and of course they do not want to assume any responsibility for whatever happens to you.”
U.S.-China Institute Director Clay Dube said the travel advisory has complicated the travel arrangements that researchers and visiting scholars have planned.  
“The main impact, as far as the Institute goes, has been in complicating some travel arrangements that some researchers had planned,” Dube said. “Also potentially complicating some of the student-oriented programs that we have in place, not just for the spring but rather for the summer and fall.”
Dube also mentioned the travel restriction may affect the orientation programs that the U.S.-China Institute normally provides for incoming international students.
“This is an important season in terms of obviously choosing the students, and then providing them with preparation so that they can come and get off to a good start,” Dube said. “It’s something the University does but all of these travel constraints are affecting that.”

Undergraduate Student Government passed an amendment Tuesday that will now allow cultural organizations to become recognized student assemblies by submitting a petition signed by at least 50 undergraduate students. Previously, proposed assemblies had to have had at least five recognized student organizations to prove student interest in the assembly’s creation. 
The Native American Student Union is one of the groups that has pushed for the passing of this resolution because of its lack of student representation in numbers. During the meeting’s open forum, NASU members said without the amendment, they would be unable to access funding or have a voice in USG. 
“We have been left out of the conversation regarding our own future,” NASU President Maracea Chase said. “Our lack of representation, our lack of resources and the fact that we just don’t have the numbers on this campus to be recognized in the way that we want to.”
Sen. Rose Ritch provided updates on the financial literacy survey that she and Vice President Mahsin Tahsin have been working on. The survey gauges students’ comprehension of their finances in order to determine what resources to provide to help them better understand money management later in life. 
Ritch also gave updates on her project to increase funding for fine art students. On Friday, she met with Thornton School of Music Vice Dean Lucinda Carver and Kaufman School of Dance Vice Dean Jodie Gates to propose how the $1 million grant the two schools received could be used for a fine arts fund for seniors who will soon be looking for jobs.
“[We’re] working on a proposal because there’s some money in there that has not been allocated,” Ritch said. “We’re working to try and have these people who made the donation to approve using as small as even $5,000 to start off with to go towards this fund.”
Director of Residential Affairs Gabriel Savage and Sens. Benjamin Shiff and Ritch provided updates on their work to revise absence policies in all schools but have faced a setback with the School of Cinematic Arts’ John Wells Division of Writing for Screen and Television attendance policy, where the department would deduct a student’s grade by 10% after the first two absences. The policy was updated Wednesday to clarify exceptions for religious observances, family and medical emergencies and personal well-being.
“As we all know, there’s been some issues with SCA recently, and so now, at our next meeting, we’ll most likely be addressing that, because it’s a real issue,” Ritch said. 
Sen. Hailey Robertson and Director of Accessibility Affairs Gwen Howard shared that they tested wheelchair accessibility on campus by physically going to various buildings on campus. Although they found everything to meet Americans with Disabilities Act requirements — including governmental standards of design and construction for public facilities — USG members found that accessibility could be improved by publishing an accessibility map and presenting their findings to senior administrators. 
“The user experience of [the buildings], essentially, can vary a lot, and we want every student to feel welcome and see facilities that are welcoming to them,” Howard said.

Among several mental health services Student Health will launch this semester is an extension of operating hours at the Engemann Student Health Center, a change that took effect Monday to address the high demand for appointments. Engemann will now remain open for scheduled appointments for two more hours during weekdays and will be open Saturdays.
Although the change will impact all Student Health services, Director of Counseling and Mental Health Dr. Broderick Leaks said it is part of a University-wide effort to improve mental health services. This is one of the first major steps in Student Health’s expansion of mental health offerings, following the November opening of the long-term mental health practice on the fifth floor of Engemann, which is expected to be fully staffed by Fall 2020, according to Leaks.  
“USC, along with the rest of the country, is really trying to figure out, ‘How do we solve this access issue and resource issue to really make sure the students are reaching their goals and living the lives that they want to live?’” Leaks said. 
Although walk-in appointments are only offered weekdays and end at 5:15 p.m. daily, scheduled appointments are now available from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturdays. Leaks said the new hours will be finalized in Fall 2020 and will include expanded walk-in hours. 
Student Health is in the process of hiring more mental health services staff, which will facilitate the expanded hours and reduce the wait time for appointments. Currently, the wait time for appointments can take up to three weeks, but the goal of extending hours and expanding the health center staff is to cut the wait to three days or fewer, Leaks said.
Emma Collins, a junior majoring in psychology, said that while addressing the booking problems is important, Student Health will still need to work on how it is perceived by students. In the past, students have complained of long wait times and the initial phone consultation requirement for psychiatric appointments.
“I think that scheduling and availability is the No. 1 issue because that’s the thing that most people talk about,” Collins said. “Even if they were to completely fix that, they’d have an image problem to fix because people are still super wary about going in or calling because they think there’ll never be availability for them.”
Leaks said the slots allocated for walk-in appointments prior to 5:15 p.m. can be used for scheduled appointments and vice versa depending on the fluctuation of demand. According to Leaks this can help accommodate for influxes in mental health appointment demands.
As of Jan. 13, all initial mental health consultations are held in person rather than over the phone, as was standard in previous semesters. Leaks said Student Health implemented the phone call policy nearly seven years ago to reduce the wait time for mental health appointments, but with the increase in staff, it has been able to shift back to the model of in-person initial appointments. Students seeking long-term counseling can still opt for a 30-minute phone conversation about referrals and resource options. 
“[The change] allows for the therapist to have a little bit more flexibility and freedom in that first encounter, and then the student can actually get started with their treatment a lot faster than they would,” Leaks said.
This semester, Student Health is working on creating more access points to mental health services. This includes the addition of “embedded counselors” — counselors who are located in a department’s respective buildings across USC and can be scheduled through MySHR, the Student Health scheduling and record portal. 
“Those embedded counselors will be in the environment of the school, they’ll know the culture of the school, they’ll be able to have a better sense of the specific dynamics for those academic departments,” Leaks said.
As part of the embedded counselor initiative, students at the Gould School of Law and the School of Cinematic Arts can now schedule appointments with their schools’ respective counselors through MySHR.
Student Health also offers the Let’s Talk program, which is a drop-in counseling program in the Student Union with liaisons for the Asian Pacific American Students Services, LGBTQ, La CASA and Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs communities, as well as in the Office of International Students. Let’s Talk recently increased its hours for international students from one hour per week to three, according to the Student Health website.
“I think the University as a whole is looking at how do we make sure the information gets to the students’ hands in a way that they actually absorb it,” Leaks said. “We’re trying to find creative and different ways throughout the year to get information to students’ hands so they can actually benefit from the immense resources the University has available.”
APASS director Jonathan Wang said that the expansion of the Let’s Talk program has allowed students to feel more comfortable in seeking counseling services, especially in a place that they are familiar with. 
“I think the model is great because it’s much more of a drop-in informal session … a 10- to 15-minute conversation,” Wang said. “Whereas I think as students are trying to determine, even if they want to go to Engemann or even if they want to approach the idea of getting therapy or support.” 
Wang also said that although the Let’s Talk program has improved mental health for students, implementing a counselor-in-residence would also be valuable to have in each of the cultural centers on campus. 
“I would love to see more of a counselor-in-residence model where …  they can actually have an [an office in the cultural centers], Wang said. “The limitations for us is that we don’t have the space for that. So all of our offices have just enough offices for our professional staff members.”

Every four years, the number of days on the calendar goes from 365 to 366, the United states elects or re-elects a president and the Summer Olympics kick off. 
As a new decade begins, I’m looking forward to the last of those three — the Olympics, which will take place from July 24 to Aug. 9. The Summer Games will be held in Tokyo, Japan, marking the return of the Olympics to a city that hasn’t hosted it since 1964. 
I’ve lived through five Olympics but because I didn’t become a sports fan until later in my life, I only remember the last two. 
The 2012 Games were when sprinter Usain Bolt was in his prime and swimmer Michael Phelps announced his first retirement after the Games concluded. I also discovered several new sports through that year’s Olympics — sports that I didn’t even know existed, like shooting and equestrian.
Now, with less than six months until the 2020 Summer Olympics, I want to focus my column this semester on the games. Whether that’s spotlighting different players, sociopolitical issues or USC’s long history with the Olympics, I want to offer my analysis and opinion on the upcoming event.
With that said, Tokyo is more than ready to host its second ever Summer Olympics. Not only will the city etch its name in the history books, but it’ll also enjoy plenty of benefits from simply hosting the Games. 
The Olympics provides any host worldwide recognition. For the 2016 Summer Olympics, the International Olympic Committee estimated that around 3.5 billion viewers worldwide tuned in, according to The Hollywood Reporter. That was about half the world’s population at the time.
If the numbers repeat themselves, the prospects for Tokyo to garner the attention it’s hoping for appear good. Once the Olympics concludes, the televised coverage of the games will make more people inclined to visit Tokyo.
The city that hosts the Olympics also has to construct or renovate many stadiums and buildings specifically for the games. The merits of this are controversial, but I think it’ll be good for the city. It pushes Tokyo to build new infrastructure and motivates the rest of the city to clean up in expectation of millions of visitors.
The Olympics helps renovate a city and gives it a new look. When my hometown Tacoma hosted the 2015 U.S. Open for golf, the whole city turned itself around. Now, even five years later, Tacoma looks so much better for it. 
The Olympics can also create much-needed profit for a city. After Los Angeles earned $215 million revenue from the 1984 Olympics, the number of cities submitting bids to host the Games jumped from two to 12 by 2004. 
This isn’t to say that hosting the Olympics will guarantee a profit. In 2016, Rio de Janeiro spent more than $20 billion to get ready. The hope was that the games would reinvigorate the city, but, unfortunately, many of the venues are now abandoned.
Tokyo is expected to spend approximately $26 billion when all said is done — about $20 billion more than what the city originally predicted according to the Los Angeles Times. However, it doesn’t look like Tokyo will be struggling financially — the city is holding lottery applications for tickets since they sold out.
