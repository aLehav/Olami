On Saturday, No. 14 USC jumped back into the win column after last week’s loss to Washington State, as it defeated Oregon State 38-10 on Saturday at the Coliseum.
“A good win for our football team — any Pac-12 win is,” head coach Clay Helton said. “[We’re] 1-0 on the week, 5-1 on the season, and looking at the game without watching the film yet, I really felt like our defense did an amazing job.”
While it was an all-around strong performance for the Trojans on both sides of the ball, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold was unable to depart from his recent turnover-prone play. In the first quarter, he fumbled the ball on his own 23-yard line in a play eerily similar to last week’s fumble against Washington State.
Then with three minutes left in the first half, Darnold threw his ninth interception of the year, failing to see a linebacker float to the ball in coverage. He almost gave up the ball again in the second half, fumbling on his own 21-yard line, but redshirt junior left tackle Toa Lobendahn recovered it on the one-yard line, narrowly avoiding a safety. Darnold had thrown nine interceptions all of last season.
“I think honestly, I’m stopping the offense a little bit right now with the way I’m turning the ball over,” Darnold said. “I’ve just got to be better.”
Outside of the turnovers, Darnold looked accurate and poised for the most part behind an offensive line reshaped due to injuries. On the game, he threw for 316 yards, completing 23 of 35 passes. However, one Oregon State player was less than impressed with the sophomore quarterback’s game.
“Nothing special,” Oregon State cornerback Kyle White said. “He’s a normal Pac-12 quarterback. I didn’t see anything special. He made his throws, made his reads. He fumbled twice. He had one picked off, should’ve been three. He’s OK.”
The Trojans started off fast and furious in their return to the Coliseum after two weeks on the road. Their first drive, which featured a balanced attack between run and pass, was punctuated by a 37-yard touchdown strike from Darnold to redshirt freshman wide receiver Tyler Vaughns over the middle. Minutes into the game, Darnold completed his longest pass since Week 3 against Texas. Vaughns finished with five catches for 68 yards and a touchdown.
The Trojans’ fast start was not limited to the offensive side of ball. Immediately following the touchdown drive, Oregon State quarterback Darrell Garretson threw an interception to a leaping sophomore cornerback Jack Jones, placing USC deep in enemy territory. Junior running back Ronald Jones II scored on a four-yard option a few plays later, giving his team an early 14-0 advantage. With the touchdown, Jones has scored in 12 consecutive games that he’s played in. While more emphasis was placed on the passing game, Jones still turned in a solid day at the office. He finished with 79 yards, averaging over six yards a carry.
“I’ve been practicing with those guys all week,” Jones said about the reshuffled offensive line. “I felt comfortable trusting the guys and the reads.”
The home team would exit the first half with a 21-3 lead, with USC’s third touchdown coming on a 16-yard touchdown catch by junior receiver Deontay Burnett early in the second quarter. Celebrating his 20th birthday on Saturday, Burnett scored his team-leading sixth receiving touchdown of the year.
The Trojans’ offensive momentum continued into the second half. After Oregon State was forced to punt, the team efficiently drove 91 yards in just over three minutes, scoring a touchdown when Darnold found freshman tight end Josh Falo wide open on a wheel route for 30 yards. It was both Falo’s first career touchdown and first career reception.
Freshman placekicker Chase McGrath added a 29-yard field goal with 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter on what would be Darnold’s final drive of the game. In backup redshirt freshman quarterback Matt Fink’s first career drive, he burst open for a 51-yard touchdown run on a read option play. After the freshman’s dynamic rush, USC fans were treated to another special moment, as blind redshirt sophomore long snapper Jake Olson once again came onto the field to snap for the extra point. As the crowd roared, Olson delivered a perfect snap.
“Credit to old Matty Fink,” Helton said. “Matt did a wonderful job getting in there and making the most of his opportunity. I’d like to thank coach [Gary] Andersen for the class he showed for allowing us to get Jake in to perform his craft.”
The Trojan defense turned in a dominant performance on Saturday afternoon. In addition to Jones’ early interception, redshirt sophomore Christian Rector came up with an important fumble recovery in the third quarter, just as the Beavers were making a push for the end zone. The defensive lineman has shown a knack for finding the football; he has two fumble recoveries and two forced fumbles on the season.
“This guy [Rector] is becoming a superstar in the last four games,” Helton said. “[He] continues to show up in big ways as we enter the month of October here.”
Overall, the defense gave up one touchdown on the afternoon, when Oregon State running back Atavis Pierce ran it in from six yards out in the fourth quarter.
“I think we played pretty well,” senior safety and team captain Chris Hawkins said. “The score says we played well, the stats say we played well. I think we can get a lot better. I’m not satisfied, but I think it was a good win for us.”

The women’s volleyball team had its five-match win streak snapped this weekend, falling to Arizona on Friday, but USC rebounded with a win at Arizona State on Saturday to raise its overall record to 13-4 (5-1 Pac-12).
The No. 15 Women of Troy had a tough day in Tucson, Ariz., getting swept 3-0 by the Wildcats at the McKale Center. Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier spearheaded the Trojan attack with nine kills and three service aces, and junior libero Victoria Garrick led the way defensively, tallying 15 digs. However, USC only hit .140 in the match compared to Arizona’s .262 mark, and the team committed 20 errors to the Wildcats’ 14. The Trojans’ sloppy play cost them their perfect conference record, as they suffered their first loss of the season in Pac-12 play.
They fared better the next day when the Women of Troy traveled to Tempe, Ariz. to face the Sun Devils. It looked like the team’s rough weekend would continue when USC committed 16 total errors to hand ASU the opening set, 25-19, but head coach Mick Haley’s squad rallied to take three consecutive sets and win the match 3-1.
The turnaround came thanks to much-improved efficiency. The Women of Troy nearly doubled their hitting percentage from the previous night against Arizona, recording a .265 mark versus ASU. Senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie, the reigning back-to-back Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week, matched her career high in kills (18), and senior opposite hitter Niki Withers set a new season best with 15 kills — including seven in the decisive fourth set, when Withers led USC’s comeback from a 4-point deficit.
Senior middle blocker Danielle Geiger added 11 kills for her season high — and her best mark since joining the Women of Troy from UC Irvine this fall. Senior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley also recorded her sixth double-double of the year against ASU with 31 assists and 11 digs. The win over the Sun Devils kept USC in second in the Pac-12 standings: The team’s 5-1 conference record puts them just behind 5-0 Stanford.
The Women of Troy return home for their next match, as they host Cal at the Galen Center on Friday. Despite being a middling 2-3 in Pac-12 play, the Bears sport an impressive 11-5 overall record. USC swept Cal 3-0 in Berkeley last season, and the team will look to repeat that feat this week.
How do you get swept by a mediocre Arizona team after sweeping the 6th ranked UW five days earlier?
That falls on the Coaching staff who obviously let that big win go to the team’s head. Nice turn around
victory over ASU who is also mediocre at best.

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold threw for over 300 yards in Saturday’s 38-10 win over Oregon State. He completed 66 percent of his passes and recorded three touchdowns. But the first few questions he fielded from the
postgame media scrum were critical of his performance. He was asked about what he needed to improve on, about what went wrong on his lone interception and about whether it was frustrating.
Finally, someone asked if this game was the most comfortable he’s felt with his receiving corps with junior Deontay Burnett and redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns both on the field. He nodded, and then a smile crept across his face.
“A positive question,” he said.
That’s the way it is at USC, where you beat a conference opponent by 28 points, where you rebound from a tough loss with a comfortable win to advance to 5-1 on the season, and yet there is more negative than positive press.
Indeed, USC could’ve played better against Oregon State. There were turnovers, fumbles, lapses and miscues that would have cost the Trojans against any competent opponent. There were periods of the offense being stagnant. The only thing that kept the Trojans’ mistakes from coming back to bite them was the fact that the Beavers are an objectively terrible team with no defense and a backup quarterback under center.
And yet, we saw Darnold and the Trojans do everything they could to give Oregon State momentum early in the game. In the first quarter, Darnold fumbled after the ball slipped out of his hands while he attempted a pass, and in the second quarter, he threw an ugly interception right into the hands of the defense. Both turnovers were in USC territory, with only the ineptitude of Oregon State’s kicking game and offense preventing points from being scored as a result.
In the context of the season, the Trojans took care of business on Saturday. They did their job against an inferior opponent. They rested some of their starters late in the game and found playing time for their reserves. Redshirt freshman backup quarterback Matt Fink subbed in for Darnold in garbage time, recording his first career touchdown on 51-yard gallop. And blind redshirt sophomore long snapper Jake Olson took a snap for the second time this season.
“I think we played pretty well,” senior safety and team captain Chris Hawkins said. “The score says we played well, the stats say we played well.”
But not the eye test. For a team that needed a clean game in all three phases before taking on two tough opponents in Utah and Notre Dame, it didn’t get it. The defense was strong, holding Oregon State to just one touchdown. But on special teams, redshirt junior cornerback and punt returner Ajene Harris muffed a punt that was recovered in USC territory, and there otherwise were no noteworthy plays.
And the offense … oh, the offense. Sure, it racked up over 500 yards, Darnold put up good numbers and 13 different receivers caught passes. But the offense still lacks an identity. It lacks the flow, the rhythm that we saw last season when Darnold would just take the snap and work his magic. Instead, it looks complacent, stale. Darnold has not moved out of the pocket as much this season, but his deep passes often fall incomplete and he is just not as in sync with his receivers as he needs to be.
Darnold was so pedestrian that Oregon State cornerback Kyle White called him “nothing special” and a “normal Pac-12 quarterback.” Whether he had any right to criticize the opponent after his team was just thumped by 28 points is debatable, but his comments are not exactly inaccurate — at least this season. Entering Saturday’s game, Darnold ranked sixth — out of 12 Pac-12 quarterbacks — in total offense with 282.8 yards per game and just seventh in pass efficiency. For reference, he finished last season ranked second in the conference in pass efficiency, trailing only Washington’s Jake Browning.
To get its hype train back on track, USC must make fixing its offense a priority, which means it must Make Sam Darnold Great Again. Whether it’s the playcalling, the receivers or Darnold himself, these issues will hurt USC next week against Utah and in two weeks in South Bend.
“When you have over 500 yards and your guts are hurting inside that you left more out there, that’s a good feeling to have,” head coach Clay Helton said. “If that’s your worst day, be happy.”
The Trojans can be “happy” with Saturday’s win. But they cannot — and should not — be satisfied.

Saturday downtown was a festive evening in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Chinatown. The main plaza was filled with Angelenos of every age and background to celebrate the 79th annual Mooncake Festival.
The Mid-Autumn or Moon Festival is celebrated by Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean cultures on the 15th day of the eighth month of the Chinese lunar calendar, the night of the full moon. This year, the zodiac Year of the Rooster, the full moon took place on Oct. 4, but there was no shortage of festival-goers waiting in line to see the nearly full moon through a large telescope once it rose above the buildings.
As the most important celebration behind Chinese New Year, the 3,000-year history of this festival is almost richer than mooncakes themselves. The festival originates from the custom of moon worship that began in the Shang Dynasty from 1600-1046 B.C. Traditionally, autumn is a time of harvest, and also an important time to gather with family to give thanks for a bountiful harvest and to pray for the future. Moon worship is an important aspect of East Asian culture, as the moon is seen as a rejuvenating force closely connected with fertility and menstruation. In Chinese culture, the round shape of the mooncakes and the full moon symbolize togetherness and family unity.
Some of the flavors of mooncake include black bean, red bean mixed nut and lotus seed paste, with lotus seed paste being the most traditional. The line ran outside the door and around the block at Phoenix Bakery in Chinatown, which has been in business since 1938. Owner Ken Chan discussed the history of the Mooncake Festival and his family’s role in bringing traditional Chinese delicacies to Los Angeles.
“I can tell you that with the new technology most bakeries and producers don’t make mooncakes the traditional way,” Chan said, and gestured to a box filled with wooden rolling pins. “But we make them the traditional way.”
Chan also explained that there are three important myths that are told during the Mooncake Festival: Chang’s flying to the moon, Wu Gang chopping the cherry bay and the Jade Rabbit.
Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
The festival was filled with many activities such as magic shows, Chinese acrobatics, Shaolin Kung Fu, cooking demonstrations, Chinese opera and calligraphy lessons.
“My mom really admires Asian culture and wanted us to experience the festival for all it represents, and it sounded like a really fun Saturday night,” festival goer Wendolyn Ortega said.
Her friend Daniel Ortega agreed.
“We also like to come to Chinatown and Olvera Street because it is a way for us to experience other cultures without going too far,” Ortega said.
The ground in the main plaza was covered in colorful paper pieces from festive poppers under strings of red and white paper lanterns. Outside of the plaza, there were other smaller parties happening in restaurants and in parking lots. Projected onto the storefronts and building walls were phrases like “The Year of the Rooster,” “Chinatown After Dark” and “Mooncake Festival,” all of which added to the feeling of togetherness and celebration.

I just finished reading the last installment of Dirty John, a recent Los Angeles Times’  crime series, with goosebumps on my arms. The twisted, non-fiction story of a serial manipulator, nicknamed “Dirty John,” in Orange County was exciting, yet frighteningly close to the quiet suburban reality of the town I grew up in.
I spent the last 18 years in Garden Grove, a small suburb of Orange County, five minutes from Disneyland. I had driven past the aforementioned locations in Dirty John, recognizing the vivid imagery Christopher Goffard, the crime journalist, described in the podcast. I had almost nothing in common with Debra Newell, the woman who was the protagonist of the series, and victim of Dirty John’s domestic terror in the series — except that we lived in the same county and we are both women.
But what some take to be an entertaining crime series with little journalistic basis (judging by the comments on every Dirty John post), I find to be another frightening scenario of domestic abuse that commonly occurs in the United States.
As a young woman, I’ve scrolled through many Tinder bios and initiated Bumble conversations just like Newell; many of my male and female friends have as well. You never really think of the possibility of matching with someone who has the potential to be a domestic abuser, that someone is out there to target you and use your vulnerabilities against you while proclaiming love for a self-seeking purpose.
When examining the statistics from the National Domestic Violence Hotline, I realize how women, every day, are faced with their own version of Dirty John. And not every woman gets a lucky, privileged ending like Newell, a wealthy woman in her late 50s who had money and a family supporting her.
Nearly one in five women have been raped in their lifetime. From 1994 to 2010, about four in five victims of domestic violence are women. One in four women have been the victims of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
We preach feminism and we strive for workplace equality, but an underlying culture of domestic violence still exists. And it’s terrifying. One in four, one in five? How many women do we all encounter on a daily basis, and how many of these statistics apply to them?
I recently read a story in the San Francisco Chronicle that details the domestic murder of an Asian American woman named Cecilia Lam. Lam was shot in the back of her head by her boyfriend, who subsequently turned the gun on himself. In the midst of the Las Vegas massacre and politically heated discussions of gun control, domestic violence is yet another aspect we must consider.
The issue of domestic abuse is one that is very nuanced and complex — so much so that it can be difficult for outsiders to truly understand why victims stay with their abusers, why they are so slow to seek help or escape. Dirty John is one such example, although it is not a definitive portrait of domestic abuse. Newell had the resources — legal and personal help — while many women are from low-income backgrounds, with little to no family support.
I’m currently in a loving and supportive relationship, but Dirty John reignites a subconscious fear I will have to face if I ever enter back into the dating pool — one almost all women have in the back of their minds.
I grew up with an overly cautious Vietnamese mother who warned me about men, about going out alone at night and sending explicit pictures of myself based on stories she heard from her friends. Although I dismissed her warnings at the time as pure parental caution, in hindsight, she was just trying to warn me about the dangers that a young woman can face in intimate relationships.
It’s easy to dismiss a crime series as mere entertainment and see John Meehan (“Dirty John”) as a danger only for naive women. The truth is that smart, hard-working, professional women are just as easy targets for manipulators and liars. And what’s worrisome is that we know stories about these women — we just never expect ourselves to be one of them.

And the point of your article is what?  For starters, you neglected to mention the role of substance abuse in most cases of domestic violence.  Women are not slow-moving targets and they have choices.  Some make poor choices regards the company they keep.  How do you define rape?  Lately it can be defined as nothing more than an unwanted touch.  This is an example of the Left raping language.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Fall semester is in full swing, and with it come the career fairs, involvement fairs and recruitment processes. As I scroll through my email only to be met with countless emails about “exploring internship opportunities” from the Career Center, I can’t help but think about how different my college experience is from how I had always imagined it would be.
I have distinct memories of my dad telling me about his college summers. He would always joke about how he worked at a dog food factory and spent a few lazy summers painting houses. He would say he didn’t decide to be a political science major until his senior year. Influenced by my family, I grew to view the college experience more as a transitory period in life — a period for balancing maturation with intellectual growth rather than an endless job hunt. In my naiveté, I thought that clubs were meant  for personal enjoyment, not for bulking up a resume. I thought that these summers that my family always spoke of were for savoring the last years of youth, not skyrocketing directly into the professional world.
However, once I got to USC, I began to understand the reality of attending a top-tier university in the 21st century. One word, one that had rarely been a part of my vocabulary prior to my experience at USC, began coming up more and more frequently in conversation: internships. It wasn’t long until I learned that the recruitment process for some summer internships began all the way in August the year before. Then came spring semester. While I was enjoying my time as an undecided student and taking exploratory courses that I really enjoyed, some of my friends already had internships. During the summer, while I was working at a local pizza shop in my hometown of Seattle, my peers were working as paid interns for Facebook, Amazon and the like. I couldn’t help but think: Am I missing something?
The truth is, I was missing something. My whole definition of college as a time for personal growth and learning was lacking a critical component and was in severe need of an update. The balance between personal and professional growth has become markedly skewed toward the professional end. Today, the workforce is considerably more competitive than it was in my parents’ time. Thus, students need to be increasingly focused on gaining experience. We millennials are growing up in a work-obsessed culture. During my parents’ time, internships were not available or necessary the same way they are now.
As I have grown to understand from my experience thus far at USC, this ideology has penetrated and shaped our higher education system. It is no longer enough just to be involved in a campus organization. In order to truly be taken seriously, students must achieve a position on the executive board. And to gain experience and secure a worthwhile internship, students must already have an impressive resume. To get a steady job, they must ideally already have internship experience.
And experience is important — but not to the point where extracurriculars are taking precedence over one’s school work. You could imagine my shock when my roommate told me about her friend who had to drop a class because rushing for a business fraternity was taking up so much of her time and energy. Or when my friend mentioned that two seniors in his fraternity already had banking jobs lined up after graduation and thus were free to slack off for all of senior year — lucky them! I have to wonder: When did the goal become about monetary success and status rather than intellectual engagement and critical thinking?
What makes this culture all the more frustrating is that it is far more accessible for some students over others. I can’t help but think about those who fall through the cracks somewhere on this high-powered course. For example, an unpaid internship simply isn’t financially possible for a student who needs an income to support their academic career. Paid internships are hard to come by. Many USC students are able to land prestigious internships because they have parents who have connections. How are first-generation or lower-income students supposed to compete with those who already have a foot in the door at competitive internships?
Perhaps my longing for the academic environment my parents spoke of is ridiculous in this day and age. But I do hope that we can at least find a better balance between personal and professional growth here at USC and foster an intellectual environment of equal opportunity for young, ambitious students. While professionalism is increasingly necessary, college should be a time for personal and intellectual growth above all else, and I do hope that the need for an impossible amount of experience doesn’t completely overshadow this notion.

I definitely agree with what you wrote, and feel that USC as a whole is a career-preparatory, practical school, as many are now. Gone are the days when school meant education and learning for the sake of learning. Even in liberal arts schools,  choosing a “practical” major has become a trend, and internships are a must for employment. 
But I, and many others, are victims of doing an internship just because it is a set track we must either follow or not follow and try to do something more impressive. But doing something else is often harder. Start a business, work on a project, write a book etc. 
I guess it’s not entirely the university’s fault or the students’. Maybe there is something flawed in the way employers currently judge candidates and evaluate their capabilities, or maybe evaluating human potential is just a very difficult thing to do. Either way, thanks for this article.

The notification went out at 12:23 p.m. last Monday morning, reading, “Police Activity at 610 Childs way JFF on UPC campus. Please avoid area, Shelter in place threat or danger to the USC community.” Out of all of the DPS notifications I have received, this one was different: It emphasized that there was a threat to the community.
The class that I was in had just taken a break, and I had wandered away to find some tea when my girlfriend called, frantic, to tell me to get to safety. I immediately called the teaching assistant and explained the situation to the class.
The notification went out as a shelter-in-place, but we quickly realized one glaring issue if the warning level was to be elevated to lockdown: There was no lock on the door. The only way to lock the door would be to do so from the outside, and the teaching assistant did not have the key. Additionally, the only pieces of furniture in the room were all on wheels, meaning there was nothing to adequately barricade with.
Fortunately, there was a room down the hall with a keycard lock that I had access to, so we safely sheltered in there until the lockdown was lifted — but it made me ask the question of what we would have done if that had not been an option.
Afterwards, the teaching assistant confessed that she had not had any type of formal training in what to do in a situation like this, and I realized that, formally, I did not know either. My responses were all pulled from high school drills.
This draws attention to a crucial disparity between potentially life-threatening situations and the training of what to do if they were to become a reality.
One solution to students becoming more aware of what they can do to keep themselves safe in a situation such as this is for USC to implement mandatory active shooter training. This can be completed online in a program similar to the drinking safety program titled AlcoholEdu — as proposed by Tiffany Lian and Tyler Matheson, two Undergraduate Student Government senators, in November 2016 — and the mandatory status could be enforced by a hold that is placed on registration until it is completed. This would give students an adequate incentive to get the training done, which could make the difference between life and death.
This training would be beneficial to students who have no experience with shelter-in-place or lockdown procedures, as well as explaining the nuances of the situation to students who are educated on drills that are very much fitted for the high school experience. It could explain the differences between a shelter-in-place and a lockdown, as well as explaining how college students should handle these scenarios while also being in a room with no lock, being outside between classes, and so forth.
There should also be required drill training for all teaching assistants. They are indeed students as well and cannot be held responsible for the safety of those in their class in the same manner that an instructor perhaps could, but they are frequently looked to for guidance by their students. By requiring shelter-in-place and lockdown training for teaching assistants, especially those who hold individual lab sections, they would be much better prepared for how to regulate such a situation if one were to arise.
This is not a new idea. There was an opinion piece in the Daily Trojan written about this by Jordyn Holman in 2014, titled “Schools should enforce lockdown safety drills.” Last year, Lian and Matheson tried to make training mandatory, but no such procedures have been implemented.
In the span of 24 hours, there were two very real, very terrifying wake-up calls: the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas, and now this active shooter scare on our very own campus. Whether or not online safety training is the way to best prepare for such circumstances, it is time to make a change to educate our students in the best manner possible to ensure their safety.

Women at USC may be getting a new chance to break the glass ceiling.
USC is the latest university to found a chapter of Smart Woman Securities, a national nonprofit organization that focuses on finance and investment education for female undergraduate students. USC is the 25th school in 2017 to start an SWS chapter, through the efforts of four co-founders who felt empowered to create a chapter to improve female students’ financial literacy.
“The driving incentive for initiating a SWS chapter on USC campus was largely due to the gender imbalance within the finance sector,” co-founder Aimee Xu said.
In addition to Xu, a junior majoring in applied mathematics and business, the USC chapter of SWS was co-founded by business administration students — junior Simran Singh, junior Michelle Dai and sophomore Amanda Douglas.
“I think the biggest [incentive] is honestly just the lack of a community on campus that really supports women interested in finance — whether it be for professional career reasons, or just for personal finance reasons,” Xu said. “You see a handful of women’s leadership groups on campus …  but none of them really focus on ensuring that women are financially literate, and can pull off managing their own personal finances.”
USC founded its chapter at a time when SWS is building its presence on the West Coast, with Stanford University and UC Berkeley chapters founded in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The organization is popular among most Ivy League universities and East Coast colleges due to their close proximity to financial centers like Wall Street.
USC does not lack professionally oriented finance organizations, Xu said, but the demographic of women in finance at USC is incredibly small compared to the number of men.
“SWS is unique in that it focuses both on financial careers and the skills that are technical and qualitative that are necessary to enter a financial career,” Singh said.
But the organization also emphasizes personal budgeting and financial literacy that is applicable to individuals of all educational backgrounds.
“I think finance in general is an industry that requires a lot of understanding of both qualitative and quantitative factors on several different levels,” Singh said. “I think that even for students who aren’t planning to go into financial careers, learning the rudimentary skills of financial analysis to help them think more critically about these issues is really important.”
Gaining SWS membership requires a rigorous process; there is a year-long educational seminar series and a requirement to pitch projects to improve members’ understanding of financial skills and investment strategies.
The program also invites experienced female figures in finance to connect with current members through hosted talks and panels.
“I think our speaker outreach efforts are really a testament to the fact that the Trojan Family is really there to support every other member of the Trojan Family,” Xu said. “A lot of the speakers are actually alumni [and] I think really it’s been a pretty organic process in just trying to reach out to alumni who graduated a couple of years ago, hearing their thoughts on the organizations.”
Furthermore, the chapter also provides an array of constructive programs for members, such as opportunities to attend annual national conferences in New York City, corporate treks and national stock pitch competitions.
The most notable opportunity, according to Xu, is the annual trip granted to join Warren Buffett for lunch and tour Berkshire Hathaway companies to speak with corporate executives. The trip is offered to any female student who completes the seminar series, and about 20 students meet with Buffett in Omaha, Neb. each year.
The founders of SWS at USC hope to foster an educational and supportive climate where female students of all majors and backgrounds can thrive.
“I think in a few years down the line, we would really love to have our complete structure set up,” Xu said. “We will be able to act upon the pitches that girls are presenting from a higher level. I would really like to see a community that is incredibly tight-knit.”
As this year brings in the chapter’s first class, the founders hope to build upon a strong sense of community, even as a professional and educational organization.
“Most fundamentally, [it should] be a social support network for the girls,” Xu said.
