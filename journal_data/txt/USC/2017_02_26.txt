A back-and-forth contest which saw USC and Arizona State trade leads on 11 occasions ended in tragic fashion for the Trojans on Sunday.
A double-digit lead for USC with 3:57 remaining in regulation evaporated as Arizona State finished the game on a 12-1 run to defeat the Trojans, 83-82, at the Wells Fargo Arena in Tempe, Ariz. 
USC (21-8, 8-8) was clinging to an 82-81 lead with 14 seconds remaining in regulation when sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright’s inbound pass was stolen by Arizona State freshman Tra Holder. Holder proceeded to get fouled on a shot attempt, and he hit two game-winning free throws to give the Sun Devils the final lead change of the game at 83-82 with seven seconds remaining. 
A 12-1 scoring run — capped off with a dunk from USC sophomore forward Chimezie Metu — gave the Trojans an 81-71 lead over Arizona State with just under four minutes in the game.  
The Trojans’ devastating, last-second loss saw them finish the game on a 2:08 scoring drought in which they missed five of their final six shots taken in regulation. USC allowed Arizona State to score seven points in the final 28 seconds to clinch the come-from-behind victory. 
The loss to the Sun Devils (14-16, 7-10) is the Trojans’ fourth consecutive loss in conference play. USC has not won a game since Feb. 9 against Oregon State and has lost its last five games played at the Wells Fargo Arena. 
After losing their final road game of the season, the Trojans fell to 8-8 in conference play and currently sit at sixth in the Pac-12 standings. USC finishes the season with a 4-5 record in road conferences game; the Trojans have failed to clinch a winning-record in road conference games since 2008.
Despite outshooting ASU from the field (56 percent to 46 percent), a 31-for-55 shooting effort from the floor was not enough to give USC a victory. 
The premier offensive performer for the Trojans in the loss was Boatwright, who finished Sunday tied for the game-high with 22 points scored. Boatwright finished the game 5-for-8 (62.5 percent) from beyond the 3-point line. 
Both USC (12-for-28, 43 percent) and Arizona State (13-for-28, 46 percent) finished with strong shooting performances from beyond the arc. The Sun Devils hit 10-of-16 3-point shot attempts in the first half. 
In a losing effort, Metu recorded his second consecutive double-double, scoring 14 points and pulling in 13 rebounds. This was the sixth double-double of Metu’s career. 
Metu hit a 3-pointer in transition at the halftime buzzer to give the Trojans a 48-47 lead entering the break. USC finished the first half on a 17-8 run over the final 4:52 to take a one point lead going into the half. 
A 14-2 run from Arizona State midway through the first half gave the Sun Devils a 28-19 lead with 9:22 remaining in the opening period. 
Arizona State junior guard Kodi Justice tied Boatwright for the game-high in scoring with 22 points. A 3-pointer from Justice pulled Arizona State within an 82-81 deficit of the Trojans with 15 seconds remaining in play. After hitting his first four 3-point shots of the game, Justice finished Sunday shooting 6-for-9 (67 percent) from long distance. 
The Sun Devils capitalized by scoring 27 points off of USC’s 12 turnovers in the game. 
USC junior guard Jordan McLaughlin, who finished with eight points on 4-of-10 shooting, recorded a game-high 10 assists against the Sun Devils Sunday. 
The Trojans opened the game by hitting eight of their first 11 shots (72.7 percent). USC finished the first half shooting 18-for-26 (69.2 percent) from the floor. 
After dropping its fourth consecutive conference game, USC will look to finish its regular season on a strong note with a homestand against Washington State (12-15, 5-10) and Washington (9-18, 2-13) in the coming week. The Trojans’ current four-game skid has stalled their hopes of clinching anything better than a No. 6 seed for the Pac-12 Tournament in March.

The No. 5 women’s swim team made a splash in Washington this weekend, finishing third in the Pac-12 Championships behind No. 1 Stanford and No. 2 Cal. On the way, sophomore Riley Scott and freshman Louise Hansson both picked up their first Pac-12 titles.
After winning the Pac-12 Championship last year, the Trojans only fell to the two top-ranked teams in the nation. Stanford finished in first with 1,587.5 points and Cal took second with 1,392 points. The Trojans ended with 1,075.5 points, edging out UCLA (1,002 points) to take the third-place spot on the podium. 
USC started out in third place on the first day of competition, but fell to fourth on the second day behind the Bruins. A surge on Sunday gave the Trojans a strong finish to solidify their spot at the top of the Pac-12.
Hansson brought home the first title of the weekend for the Trojans on the second day of competition, winning the 100-yard fly in 50.39 seconds. Hansson, who competed for the Swedish Olympic team in 2016, broke the school record twice on her way to winning the title. Her final time is the second fastest posted in the nation this year. The next night, Hansson followed her title win up with a tie for the third-place finish in the 100-yard free,
finishing neck-and-neck with Cal
senior Farida Osman in 47.36 seconds. 
Scott rounded up the Trojans’ second title win after she scrapped back to overcome fellow sophomore Kirsten Vose, posting a personal record of 2:06.20 minutes to win the 200-yard breaststroke race. Vose finished close behind in third. Scott took home second in both 100-yard and 200-yard breast last year.
Sophomore Maddie Wright also finished on a high note in individual events from the weekend. Wright posted her second personal record of the night to lead a group of three Trojans in the 200-yard fly event. She took home second place with a time of 1:52.67 minutes, barely closing behind Stanford sophomore Ella Eastin’s 1:51.85-minute finish. In the same event, freshman Catherine Sanchez took seventh in 1:57.97 minutes, with freshman Tatum Wade finishing just behind at eighth in 1:58.05 minutes.
The Trojans anchored the final day of the meet with a second place in the 400-yard free relay, as Hansson, Vose, freshman Stanzi Moseley and senior Anika Apostalon broke the school record with a 3:09.57 finish. Hansson scooped up her final school record of the weekend by breaking the school mark of 47.22 for a 100-yard finish.
Despite dropping two places in this year’s finish after last year’s championship victory, the weekend was a victory in the light of this year’s stacked Stanford program, which picked up its 20th Pac-12 championship on the backs of Olympic champions Katie Ledecky and Simone Manuel. The Trojans will now look ahead to the NCAA Championships on March 15.

This weekend the Trojans finished off the regular season against Arizona State and Arizona on the road, dropping both games by close margins. 
On Friday, the Trojans fought hard in a narrow 69-62 loss to Arizona State. After previously beating them by 15 last month at the Galen Center, this time the Sun Devils were much more proficient on offense thanks to a combined 39 points from Sophie Brunner and Quinn Dornstauder. 
ASU led 31-29 at halftime, and USC recaptured the lead on three different occasions. However, a strong 20-point fourth quarter by the home team, in which the Sun Devils scored a vital 10 free throws, effectively put the Trojans away. In a complete reversal from last weekend’s homestand against Washington State and Washington, the team struggled mightily with 3-pointers all evening. 
The Trojans went 6-of-21 from long range, with senior 3-point specialist Courtney Jaco having an uncharacteristically cold night. ASU did not need the long ball to down USC; it made just two threes but used its considerable size advantage to pound inside.  Junior forward Kristen Simon scored a team-high 14 points with five rebounds, while no other Trojan reached double-digits. 
“I think we played them really tough,” Jaco said. “At the end of the day, the team that made the least mistakes was going to go on top, and I think we had a couple of key turnovers and missed box outs on free throws that gave them momentum.” 
Unfortunately for Jaco and the Trojans, Friday’s 3-point struggles persisted in Sunday’s 67-62 loss to Arizona in Tucson. This time, Jaco went 2-of-8 and her team shot under 30 percent from deep for the second game in a row. 
“A lot of us didn’t have our feet set and our hands ready,” Jaco said. “We weren’t really ready to shoot. We just chucked up a lot of shots, myself included. We’re a team that should make those shots and we know that.” 
In the matchup between the Trojans and the bottom-ranked Wildcats, Simon played just 11 minutes before being sidelined with an undisclosed injury in the second quarter. In order to pick up the offensive slack, freshman guard Minyon Moore produced a solid outing. The non-starter played a team-high 32 minutes, scoring 21 points with three assists and three rebounds. 
To start off the game, the Wildcats quickly got out to a 7-0 run in just over two minutes. At one point in the first quarter the home team led by as many as 17 points. However, the Trojans were undeterred by their early hole, and fought back steadily, cutting the deficit to five points by halftime. 
USC looked determined to complete its comeback in the fourth quarter, finally tying the game at 52 by way of a Jaco 3-pointer, although Arizona would regain the lead soon after. Down 63-58 with 22 seconds left, the Trojans appeared to be out of the game once again. However, Moore came through with a clutch 3-pointer that put her team firmly in striking distance. 
With Arizona in possession of the ball and just 15 seconds on the clock, Moore made another game changing play. She stole the ball and drove to the hoop, getting fouled by Arizona guard Malena Washington. Down by two points, making both free throws was essential, especially with such little time on the clock. However, Moore missed the first and made the second. After four consecutive Wildcat free throws, the game was effectively iced. 
“For Arizona, we just didn’t start out with the right level of aggression,” said Jaco. “We didn’t play with any sense of urgency until it was too late.”
For the season, USC finishes at 14-15 with a 5-13 conference record. They end up in a tie for last place in the Pac-12 with Arizona, who finished with an identical record, along with Colorado and Utah. The Trojans begin Pac-12 Tournament play this Thursday as the No. 9 seed against No. 8 California, who beat USC 63-56 earlier this month. The conference championship tournament will be played at the Key Arena in Seattle. 
“I feel really good [about the Pac-12 Tournament] actually,” Jaco said. “We beat the No. 1 team in the conference and we beat the last team too. There’s a lot of parity within the league and I think more than any other year, any team can win.”
Parity my rear end. Another crappy conference record for Cooper. What reason is there for letting her continue to be the head coach? Time to clean house, and get the program competitive nationally. No reason that the ‘ruins can be a top twenty team while the Trojans are in the dumpster being eight game under .500 in the Pac-12. What say you Lynn Swann? Do the right thing!

When Rudy Guevarra Jr. filled out identification forms in elementary school, he remembers never checking the provided boxes for race. Instead, he drew his own box, and wrote “Mexican-Filipino,” unable to choose one parent’s culture over the other. 
Guevarra delivered the keynote address for the Critical Mixed Race Studies Conference on Sunday, a speech titled “Borderlands of Multiplicity: Reflections on Intimacies and Fluidity in Critical Mixed Race Studies”. The three-day conference held at USC featured a series of workshops, lectures, panels, movie-screenings and concerts on the topic of “Trans,” coinciding with the Hapa Japan Festival. It was hosted by USC Shinso Ito Center for Japanese Religions and Culture. 
An associate professor of Asian Pacific American studies at Arizona State University, Guevarra spoke about his mixed race heritage as a “Mexipino,” or Mexican-Filipino, growing up in the borderland city of San Diego and how that influenced his doctoral research in borderlands, labor history and multiethnic identities. 
He noted that the multiplicity of ethnicities he grew up around — Samoan, Hawaiian, black, etc. and the border he shared with Tijuana, Mexico — helped shape the complex stories he wrote about that traverse race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, faith, citizenship and settler-indigenous statuses. 
His research on the borderlands theory, or trans-borderland experience, specifically explores the border between Mexico and America, which he said is land in which “the               third-world borders the first world.”
“It is a state of transformation and transition that we embody in an era now that reeks of fear and animosity towards difference and change,” Guevarra said. 
Guevarra attributed this animosity to the era of President Donald Trump, whom he referred to as “45.” He said that Trump has created a literal and figurative “barrier intimidation and violence” within borderland inhabitants, Muslims, African Americans and Native Americans, and with the promise of constructing a larger wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
“As scholars, educators, writers, artists, activists and students, it is our responsibility to use the skills and knowledge we’ve acquired to collectively educate and transform the social consciousness of our society so that these bodily and geographical borders are erased,” Guevarra said.
Dana Stone, assistant professor of marriage and family therapy at Cal State Northridge, attended the speech and conference and connected it with her personal experience as a biracial person and her research in black-white  biracial identity development.
“A lot of mixed-race people seek community,” Stone said. “This is a great place to find community, but also to know that my research is important — that there is a group of people that it represents. It’s really important for their voices to be heard.”
The conference fell on the 50th anniversary of the 1967 Loving v. Virginia decision that declared anti-interracial marriage laws unconstitutional. 
“It’s not just celebrating who we are are, but also reflecting on how our multiplicity can enhance the greater good of the communities we work in,” said Chandra Crudup, co-coordinator of the Critical Mixed Race Studies Conference.
Each day of the conference featured several panels and roundtable discussions that included professors from across the country.  The final day of the conference concluded with a screening of  Mixed Match, a film that explores the difficulties multiracial blood cancer patients have finding genetic matches. The screening was followed by a bone marrow drive and a closing program.
Jasmine Chu, the school and public programs coordinator at the San Diego Museum of Man, said that through the conference, she hopes to attain the tools to best bring issues of race to students to allow them to speak about the issues in the museum workshops through “Race: Are We So Different?”, their new exhibit. Beyond the museum, she believes that more communication can also help students learn about race.
“The best way I can think of to stop hate would be interacting with people that aren’t like yourself,” Chu said. “The more that you’re able to hear their stories, the more you realize that you’re more similar than you are different.”

Professor Shri Narayanan of USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering received the Niki and C. L. Max Nikias Chair in Engineering. This honor is the first formal recognition in Nikias’ name.
Narayanan is a professor of electrical engineering, computer science, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience and pediatrics. He has served as director of the Ming Hsieh Institute of Electrical Engineering since 2010, and director of the Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab since 2005.
Nikias recruited Narayanan nearly two decades ago, when Nikias was a Viterbi professor.
“One of my most enduring and heartfelt achievements while at USC Viterbi was to help recruit Shri,” Nikias said to USC News. “Seventeen years ago, one could not overestimate his towering intellect and creativity.”
Narayanan’s lab focuses on                human-centered technologies. By using data scientific approaches to understand human cognition, aspects of human behavior are explored further. In the context of this, Narayanan wants to bring greater understanding to mental health. 
“We are trying to find more objective ways of diagnosing autism, as well as understanding changes in behavior in response to the treatment,” he said.
Additionally, Narayanan’s work spreads to media studies, particularly focusing on unconscious biases and their representation in media and the effect this has on society.                                                                                                        
 Narayanan’s work is unique in that it brings mathematics and computer science into the equation. 
“These subjects traditionally have been dealt with very qualitatively,” Narayanan said. “We try to combine multiple perspectives from different fields like engineering, psychology and linguistics.”
By bringing objective quantitative analysis to psychotherapy, Narayanan hopes to better understand the mental condition of patients in addiction therapy and counseling.
Nikias presented the award to Narayanan on Feb. 15 at Tutor Hall.
“I feel very honored and excited, because [Nikias] is a leader in the field I’ve worked in,” Narayanan said. “He’s also one of my mentors. It’s very meaningful for me on both a personal and a professional level.”

On Friday, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted High School Journalism Day, inviting 115 high school students from nine different high schools in the Los Angeles area.
The biannual event, which is in its fourth year, began as an initiative of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists in collaboration with Jaime Carias, the Annenberg Civic Engagement Coordinator. The event has expanded to include the National Association for Black Journalists and the Annenberg Latino Student Association.
The agenda included an introduction by Willow Bay, the director of Annenberg, a keynote speech by KABC-TV news anchor and USC alum Marc Brown, and a variety of smaller workshops on a plethora of journalism and communication techniques.
Barbara Estrada, a senior studying broadcast and digital journalism, is the founder and former president of the USC NAHJ.
“After establishing NAHJ, I thought, ‘OK, we need to give back,’” Estrada said. “It’s a great way for us to get to know our community and the South L.A. communities.”
Estrada helped to lead a workshop called “The Power of Social Media Storytelling,” with Dimelo, a media organization started at Annenberg for Latino audiences.
Carias credited Estrada with the idea for High School Journalism Day and is thrilled with the program’s continued growth and sustainability.
“We are able to expose youth to media and journalism and have them go home knowing it’s possible for them to pursue a career in media,” Carias said. “A lot of students are from two miles away, but they’ve never stepped foot on campus. To expose them to what we do at Annenberg and to see them walk into our TV studio and say ‘Wow,’ is really meaningful to me.’”
Nicole Slack, a high school senior from Dorsey High School, is now considering majoring in journalism after touring the Annenberg Media Center.
“I had taken a filmmaking class, but I didn’t know about how much time radio or broadcasting took,” Slack said. “I didn’t know anything about how the marketing works. I felt like today I got more inside knowledge about everything that goes into journalism.”
Alan Mittelstaedt, associate professor of professional practice of journalism, led a workshop called “Journalism Starts with You” in conjunction with Noorhan Maamoon, a junior majoring in print and digital journalism. They emphasized the accessibility of journalism in the age of technology.
“If you don’t feel completely comfortable practicing journalism, that’s okay,” Mittelstaedt said. “Our job is to push you out of your comfort zone.”
At the end of the presentation, Mittelstaedt gave students the opportunity to submit a piece to him about the impact of President Donald Trump’s policies in their community.
“Toward the end of the presentation, there is usually a half dozen students who tell really compelling stories about things going on in their communities, and I say, ‘You’ve got to write about that,’” Mittelstaedt said.
April Barrillas, a high school senior Manual Arts High School, serves as editor-in-chief of her school newspaper. She hopes to study zoology and wildlife in college, but would like to to use the journalistic skills she has learned later in her life.
“I want to tell people about how their actions affect the community and how we’re destroying animal habitats. I believe people should know more about it,” Barrillas said. “I wasn’t initially interested in [journalism] but now I’m in it, I understand all the research and interviews that go into a story.”

On Thursday, NPR released a story about the significance of Asian last names in job interviews. According to a study conducted by Ryerson University and the University of Toronto, researchers found that employers inherit a systemic bias against minorities in hiring processes. In particular, they concluded that job applicants with Asian last names (Indian, Pakistani or Chinese) were 28 percent less likely to be called back for an interview in comparison to applicants with Anglo last names.
I had a visceral reaction to what I had read. As a first-generation Vietnamese American, I was not raised to assimilate with “American culture.” In fact, it was the opposite. Though I was born in America, I only spoke Vietnamese until I was six. My parents, as with many other Vietnamese parents in the community, knew the importance of passing on traditions to their children. 
I embraced my Vietnamese heritage. My parents read me bedtime stories about great Vietnamese legends and emperors. At school, most of my classmates were also Vietnamese. In addition to celebrating other American holidays, teachers and students also held festivities for Vietnamese New Year. I was raised around people who shared the same background as me, who ate the same food as I did and who also battled with understanding their Vietnamese American background. 
Things were different after I left for college — I became part of the minority. Though I knew I wanted to leave the cultural bubble that I was raised in, I was not prepared. When I arrived at USC, I felt like I had arrived in another world — one vastly different from the world I lived in 40 minutes away. 
In a sea of 19,000 undergraduate students, I was only part of the 17.6 percent who identified as Asian American, while the majority of the student body was 33.1 percent Caucasian. USC is diverse — it’s a school that prides itself in the diversity of its students. However, I came to an immediate understanding as a freshman that if I wanted to find friends, I would have to choose between two dichotomies: join an Asian-based organization and make Asian friends or try harder to assimilate with a group of people who didn’t share any cultural similarities with me. 
As this year came around, I began to think a lot more about my career path. I received an internship to work at a public affairs PR firm, and it felt rewarding knowing that I was making advances in my professional endeavors. I was relatively optimistic about securing job opportunities in the future because I thought that I had adapted well — enough to speak and interact with people beyond my cultural perspective. An internship at Porter Novelli or PMK-BNC didn’t seem too far-fetched because I assumed that my resume would speak for itself. 
However, after reading that NPR article and doing some more research, I became severely disappointed. It’s alarming that in a multicultural country like the United States, systemic discrimination still exists in the workplace. I, like many other first-generation Asian Americans, worked hard to build a better future for myself. Our parents came to this country to give us better opportunities — they instilled in us a fighting spirit, with the belief that if we put our mind to something, we would be able to accomplish it. 
However, to think that my ethnic heritage, my skin color and my name could be a reason for not getting job opportunities is truly disheartening. As the age-old argument goes, Asian Americans are not the “other.” We’re not “foreign.” We’re just as American as any other white person. But why are we treated so differently?
According to the NPR article, those with Asian last names shared the same qualifications as their Anglo counterparts, but were still less likely to get called back for a job interview. It’s egregious that systematic biases still exist today, and it’s disturbing that many other Asian Americans and I may face this form of discrimination in the future when we go out into the professional world.
It’s a sad day to learn that Asians still need to work harder to fit in, to belong and to earn the same merits as their white counterparts. And for me, reading that NPR story on Thursday night allowed me to come to the conclusion that my cultural differences will always set me apart from other people. I know that I’ll still carry the humiliating feeling of not belonging, not only in the social atmosphere but also in the world that I’ll step foot in after graduating. Nevertheless, I hold onto the hope that it will change.
I know my worth. I have my merits. And I’ll always love being Asian American. But when will I deserve the same treatment and respect as someone with a white last name?

Photo courtesy of Somlit InthalangsySoulful songwriter · Hyphenated is a compilation of works Leo Xia has written throughout his college career. The success of his EP is the result of multiple months of crowd-funding his debut project on Kickstarter.
For senior Leo Xia, Friday was no average night. It marked the inauguration of his career as a singer-songwriter as he released his EP album, Hyphenated. That evening, Tommy’s Place was invigorated with music and life as friends, students and local artists flooded the venue to celebrate Xia’s artistic debut.
 Although Xia has been making and performing music for years, the concert was rife with personal firsts. In addition to unveiling his first independent body of work, Xia launched a line of merchandise and played with a full band for the first time.
His voice and acoustic guitar were accompanied onstage by the talents of Erin Kim on lead guitar, Mark Adam Mekailian on drums, Andrew Liu on keyboard and Jimmy Chen on bass guitar.
Most notably for Xia, the concert signified his “artistic awakening” and a means for him to prove his commitment to music to family and friends. 
“Different ethnicities are pigeonholed in different ways, but for Asian Americans, we’re pigeon-holed in a very specific way as the ‘model minority,’” Xia said. 
Hyphenated holds significant meaning for Xia, especially since his songs center on themes of cultural identity. 
Hyphenated features six original songs, all of which were previously written but professionally produced and compiled for the first time: “Split Down the Middle,” “Jealousy,” “Yellow,” “Shaky Arms,” “Faded Photo” and “Kite.” After Friday’s event, the full album was made available on online streaming platforms and on sale as a CD. 
The production of Hyphenated began when Xia was approached by Kairos Music Group after performing at Tuesday Night Café, an Asian American open mic scene. The Los Angeles-based company offers affordable music production in world- class studios to budding, independent artists. Xia funded his personal venture via Kickstarter.
Though he will soon be graduating with a degree in industrial and systems engineering, Xia intends to pursue music full-time with support from part-time jobs. Xia regards his pursuit of a major he cares little about as an experience emblematic of Asian American cultural norms.
“People view Asians as very smart but only good at certain professions,” Xia said. “I wish I’d just told myself when I was applying to college, it’s OK if your major’s not the most conventional, just go for it. Find what makes you happy.”
Having grown up in Beijing surrounded by first-generation immigrant adults, Xia cites YouTube-famous Asian American artists — including David Choi, Clara C and Wong Fu Productions — as his biggest inspirations. He said he appreciates the special significance of seeing Asian American role models in the media — role models who look like him.
Xia’s mindfulness of and passion for Asian American representation in media and entertainment is manifest in his music. “Split Down the Middle” laments the cultural dichotomy and lack of transnational understanding that afflicts the Asian American experience: “Felt like a stranger everywhere I went / Such confusion all across the board, are you American? / How could you be with a face like that? / At this point how do I even react?”
Xia’s lyrics are critical aspects of his music; he effectively translates his unique experiences into heartfelt words that encourage the listener to empathize with him and others who have faced similar struggles.
“I think the core message of my music is Asian American self-determination,” Xia said. “I want to tell other Asian Americans that you can actually do whatever you want to if you set yourself to it, despite what your parents say and despite what society tries to impose on you.”

The School of Dramatic Arts put on a production of Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s The Rivals at the Bing Theatre last weekend. Set in Bath, England in the late 18th century, the play told the story of Lydia Languish (Alyona Podkolzina) and her suitors Captain Jack Absolute (Michael Khachanov), Bob Acres (Richard James O’Young) and Sir Lucius O’Trigger (Gogo Ivanovski). 
Written in 1775, The Rivals was not only Sheriden’s first play, but also his most famous. The play was directed by Andy Robinson, a professor of theatre practice who has achieved notable success as a film and television actor and director for over 30 years. 
As its namesake would suggest, the rivalries of Lydia’s suitors drove the complexity of the play. Its plot involves mistaken identities, farcical twists and grand miscommunication that is all told through a satirical lens. 
The Rivals centers around the love affair of the hopelessly romantic Lydia Languish and Captain Jack Absolute. Jack, the son of a wealthy baronet, courts Lydia under a secret identity, posing as a poor officer under the alias Ensign Beverley. Though Lydia is thrilled at the prospect of being courted by Jack’s alias, her guardian, Mrs. Malaprop, strongly objects to their relationship due to Beverley’s low social status.
The Rivals stayed true to its name — the play introduced two other suitors who competed with Jack for Lydia’s hand. Nevertheless, Lydia remained loyal to Beverley, only to spurn him later when she realizes he had deceived her of his true identity. Through dramatic duels, proclamations of love and a cleverly written dialogue, The Rivals presents viewers with an engagingly satirical vision of 18th century courtship, love and marriage.
The plot of The Rivals is almost unimportant to the audience’s enjoyment of the show. The play’s narrative became purposefully over-complicated as Sheridan intermingles the plot with long and complex digressions of wit and humor — complete with winding dialogue that satirizes 18th century romance. 
The play went on various tangents to comment on women’s literacy and participation in other societal customs of the time period. With unfamiliarly antiquated dialogue and subject matter, the play could come off as stilted, and could fail to resonate with the average theatregoer. 
Nevertheless, the actors deserve credit for their roles. Laughs and giggles from the theater showed their success. The natural appearance of the actors’ old-fashioned interactions and their confident stage presence demonstrate their mastery of Sheridan’s archaic dialogue. 
At times, a few of the actors’ accents slipped, losing their British inflection for brief moments. However, the protagonists’ acting was so well-tuned that the audience went along with it. 
There were a few standouts in the cast, such as Shaun Heard, a graduate student studying fine arts, who played the role of Sir Anthony Absolute. Sir Absolute is the father of Jack and attempts to arrange his son’s marriage. Intimidating and domineering, Heard captured the audience’s eye when he walked on stage. His comedic depiction easily garnered the most chuckles that night. 
The performance effectively satirized the wealth of these characters and the upper echelons of England. The lavish costumes, crafted by designer Howard Schmitt, helped the actors pop out from the background without being overly anachronistic. 
The performance’s success was also due to Robinson’s solid direction. As with any production, there were a few awkward pauses, like a lack of music in scene transitions that left the theater silent while stagehands move the props. Yet, the actors’ improvisation in the face of on stage issues — like when a door wouldn’t close or an actor’s ponytail fell off — morphed them into comedic occurences.

Another month, another ballot. It’s easy to become overwhelmed by the near constant elections, disenchanted by the political system and even apathetic by city issues. But civic engagement, especially for those from Los Angeles County, didn’t end on Nov. 8 — it only started.
Although not as tedious as the general election ballot in November, March 7 will greet voters with ballot measures and choices for mayor, city attorney, city controller and eight city council districts.
Before despairing over the prospect of another ballot filled to the brim with acronyms and the names of middle-aged politicians, realize that local elections are often the most important ones. For one, by their nature, fewer people can vote in local elections in comparison to state and national ones with larger electorates, magnifying each voter’s voice. And local elections are notorious for low turnout, meaning that each vote counts even more. In fact, fewer than one in five eligible residents in Los Angeles vote in mayoral elections. Considering that thousands of USC students are eligible L.A. voters, our campus could quite literally change an election.
And we, especially as millennials, cannot afford to remain silent. The median voter age in the most recent mayoral elections across 50 U.S. cities was 57, meaning that baby boomers and other older generations disproportionately shape local politics at the expense of young voters and their interests. It’s simple to view our college experience through the insular campus lens, but we are part of a greater community that needs to hear our voice.
 If you wonder why USC should even want to influence the ballot box, local issues often have a greater effect on residents, especially students, than state or national policies do. For example, housing policies developed by ballot measures and city council decisions determine rents for the local area, including the developments surrounding campus. Furthermore, minimum wage hikes and economic policies directly affect job prospects and outcomes for students interning or hoping to stay in the area after graduation.

Even if we hold little stake in this election, with one small stroke of a pen we can take one giant leap for marginalized populations such as the homeless. With just a .25 cent sales tax, Measure H will raise billions of dollars over the next decade to turn the tide in Los Angeles’ struggle to address the largest chronically homeless population in the country. So essentially, for every 110 grande lattes you buy from Starbucks, you pay $1 to fund programs that support the homeless. That’s a sacrifice I hope we’re all willing to make.
And regardless of whether or not we can vote in this local election, it’s our responsibility to be an advocate for the voiceless by encouraging friends to vote and promoting awareness in person or on social media. L.A. County voters especially should practice due diligence by researching the issues and coming to educated decisions for all of our sakes.
 A recent USC Dornsife/California Community Foundation/Los Angeles Times poll found that 49 percent of L.A. County residents cited time as a reason why they didn’t get more involved in the community and 39 percent said they weren’t sure what they could do to help. But with voting, we can — in the span of a few minutes — make a difference at little personal cost to ourselves, and possibly, at great benefit to us and others.
Especially if you aren’t from the area, it’s easy to see Los Angeles simply as a launching pad. But as a USC student, and especially as a resident, it’s crucial to be present and to be aware during our years at college. Los Angeles may be known as the City of Dreams, but for many, gentrification, inequality, homelessness, poverty and myriad other issues ground hopes and aspirations. The solution starts with us.

If 2017 has forced me to learn or recognize anything new, it is surely that I will no longer, as so many have suggested for productive discourse, “agree to disagree.” How often in political debate, whether 54 comments deep into a Facebook post or across the dinner table, has this phrase been used? In the past, I have readily accepted this sentiment as a pacifying and conciliatory end to what was likely a heated discussion. When an impasse has been reached, with no agreement in sight, the phrase “agree to disagree” presents itself as a kind of oasis, giving one permission to finally walk away and tend to that throbbing headache. 
A couple weeks ago, however, I realized that agreeing to disagree should have little place in the Trump era. My realization began on a Saturday night at dinner with family and friends. I was, as usual, starkly outnumbered. The breakdown was exactly seven conservatives to one liberal. I, of course, was the lonesome liberal, attempting to anticipate whether politics would enter the conversation between appetizers and the main dish or closer to the time of signing the check. I think the word “Trump” creeped into the conversation around the time I finally picked up my fork and began to eat.
A family friend at the table first made a comment praising President Donald Trump’s travel ban. While I cannot recall his exact words, I remember asking myself, “Should I respond?” In situations such as this one, I repeatedly find myself caught between potentially setting off a fruitless debate that will leave me with nothing but a throbbing headache, or — as my nature compels me — speaking out against injustice. I chose the latter. 
Two hours later, now at my cousin’s home, I was exasperated — unsure how many times the prejudice in the room could shock me — yet I was still unwilling to give up. That is, until my cousin, who had entered the debate back at the restaurant, through tired eyes, said, “I guess we just have to agree to disagree.” I paused. Then, as I typically do when this familiar phrase emerges, I gave him a half smile, nodded, and responded, “I guess so.” 
Driving home and reflecting on the evening, I couldn’t shake that ending where I had agreed to disagree. It dawned on me then — when defending matters of life and death, agreeing to disagree is an untenable response. Assenting to “agree to disagree” is undoubtedly appropriate in certain contexts. My friends and family and I, however, were not debating whether cold weather or warm weather is preferable. We were engaging in topics that mean life and death for thousands of people depending on our government’s response. Trump’s proposed policies, such as repealing Obamacare and relaxing gun control laws, could not only take lives but also ravage entire communities.
These issues transcend partisan politics. They are some of the greatest moral issues of our time, and they demand our attention. Ultimately, only from a place of privilege is one able to agree to disagree. If Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids don’t threaten to tear your family apart and you need not fear a presidential administration so intent on scapegoating vulnerable communities, then one has the luxury of giving up a debate which has no personal consequences. 
I decided that night that I will no longer be complicit and bask in the safety of my privilege. Rather, with love toward all, I will resist, and I will persist.

Something that can difficult about adjusting to freshman year is realizing that you may not necessarily be at the top of your class anymore. USC is a very selective institution, so we will be taking classes with an intellectual group of students, which is an excellent thing but can be intimidating. It was certainly scary for me, and it can be a difficult thing to cope with at first. In the beginning of last semester, I was extremely anxious about my academic standing among my peers because everyone is so smart, and I psyched myself into thinking that I was not on their level. I had to constantly remind myself that I was accepted to USC for a reason, and I just had to do my best. Ultimately, I ended up making Dean’s List, studying harder than I ever had before, and I was grateful for being pushed past my comfort zone. The premise of this article is not to advertise my accomplishment but remind my fellow freshmen is that it is OK not be the academic star anymore but to do your best because that is all you can do. College is a time in our lives when we need to remind ourselves that we are here to learn, not just to get a 4.0. 
I went to an extremely competitive high school, so that drive to be the best had just been ingrained in my mind for so long that my love for learning was often compromised for all the wrong reasons. Tracking my growth as a student since the beginning of my first semester until now helped me see that being immersed in such an academically stimulating environment was ultimately the best thing for me. My advice is to take a breath and allow yourself to learn for your own enjoyment because college is much too short to get caught up in the craziness of numbers and perfectionism. We must learn from our mistakes and take advantage of the opportunities we have here: incredible professors, a myriad of courses across so many disciplines, fellow students who will challenge us to unlock our potential. As my political science professor repeatedly says, being pushed in the classroom is like eating our intellectual spinach. It is not always pleasant or easy, but it is in our own benefit and brings the most returns.

While I love to work out every day, sometimes I experience those days when I don’t have the motivation to go to the gym. It is not only because it is a far walk, but also because working out is a commitment for which I have to mentally prepare. So, how do you get in the state of mind to workout when you’re having a lazy day? 
Here are my top ten recommendations:

Santa Clarita Diet
Bon Appetit! Or should I say Bone App the Teeth? This show nails an interesting premise and provides a good weekend’s worth of binge-watching. Centered around a typical California suburban family where both parents are real-estate agents, the show turns pretty gross quickly when Sheila (Drew Barrymore) finds out she’s a zombie. Her husband Joel (Timothy Olyphant) and daughter Abbey (Liv Hewson) must simultaneously find out just exactly what’s going on with Sheila, while also keep up the appearance of a normal family in front of their nosy neighbors. They quickly enlist the help of Abbey’s nerdy friend Eric (USC’s very own Skyler Gisondo) to help diagnose and maybe find a cure!
This show is super quirky and very well written, often balancing on the line between completely implausible and slightly realistic. My favorite characters were by far Joel (Timothy Olyphant) who tries so hard to offset Barrymore’s often over-the-top energy, and Eric, whose innocence and eagerness to help is adorable without being cheesy or overplayed. The fast pace and high energy of the show does take some getting used to, but it’s a great one to watch with some friends (or alone) with some popcorn (or a whole pizza) and escape midterm season for ten episodes!

Borderline
If you like doc-style comedies like The Office and Parks and Recreation, then you will absolutely love this comedy about a UK Border Security office in the fictional Northend Airport. True to it’s style, this show makes you cringe with second-hand embarrassment just as much as it makes you laugh. While it does mirror The Office quite closely, especially in the dynamics of its ensemble cast, it differs in day-to-day routine. The cast includes the slightly alcoholic but just-trying-to-be-cool boss, who they just call Proctor (Jackie Clune), Tariq (David Avery), the young and handsome guy who is just trying to save up enough money so he can really focus on his DJ career, the naive nerd Clive (David Elms) who actually wants to be there, and the bumbling Scottish hopeless romantic Grant (Jamie Mitchie) who all make up the office. 
This show’s humor is dry and unrestricting, and the Narrator manages to contradict the characters at almost every moment. “The Border Patrol has been working very hard to make sure our borders are safe…” cut to a shot of Clive unnecessarily detaining his favorite actor from Game of Thrones, only to ask him about the show. With the first season coming in at just under three hours, this show is a tease (but in a good way) for those like me who miss the days when The Office still had seasons to go before completion.
