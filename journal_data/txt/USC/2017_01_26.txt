Race to the top · Austin Dunn, Daniel Million and Rachel Udabe began campaigning for the presidency Thursday. There are 13 candidates are running for USG Senate positions. Elections will begin on Feb. 7 – Photos from USG Elections website
Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Austin Dunn, Rachel Udabe and USG Senator Daniel Million announced their candidacies for USG President Thursday night.
The Vice President and Senate campaigns were also officially revealed Thursday. Three presidential tickets and 13 senatorial candidates were announced through the USG Elections Facebook page, USG website and websites for the specific campaigns.
Dunn, a junior majoring in political science and pursuing a master’s in public diplomacy, is one of the three candidates running for USG president. His running mate, Morgan Monahan, is a junior majoring in business administration.
Dunn served as USG vice president for the 2016-2017 school year. In addition, Dunn previously served as the director of university affairs for USG and was the vice president of the Pre-Law Society. Dunn is also a member of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity, and Monahan is a member of the Pi Beta Phi sorority.
Dunn and Monahan are running on a platform of increased campus security, including sexual assault prevention and active shooter training; improved outreach toward transfer students, spring admits and first-generation students; and partnerships with the Los Angeles Metro. They also plan to move USC in a more environmentally friendly direction by installing solar panels, reducing styrofoam use and increasing recycling and composting on campus.
“Morgan and I have a unique presidential ticket going on — we pride ourselves running a campaign on progress and change,” Dunn said. “Due to our extensive experience in the organization, we’re continuing work that has already been done.”
The second ticket consists of Udabe, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development and political science, and Rebecca Harbeck, a sophomore majoring in economics and sociology, as her running mate.
Udabe is currently a campus tour guide for the Office of Undergraduate Admission, and has previously worked as an orientation advisor. She served as a resident assistant in Birnkrant Residential College during her sophomore year, and interned in the office of U.S. Representative Linda Sanchez in her home district of Eastern Los Angeles County in 2014. Harbeck, meanwhile, is active in the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, writes for U.S.-China Today at USC’s U.S.-China Institute and is a member of the Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law and Alpha Gamma Delta fraternities.
“Rebecca and I will bring a new perspective to the table for USG,” Udabe said. “How it’s different from the other candidates is that though they have USG experience, we bring a plethora of USC experience. We believe that with our involvement in the diverse communities at USC, we will meet a lot of the students’ needs not from a top-down perspective, but from a bottom-up perspective.”
Udabe and Harbeck’s platform features new initiatives such as a mentorship program between current students and transfers, spring admits and international students; the implementation of USG office hours to make senators more accessible to the student body; and the creation of 24-hour snack options at University dining halls. Udabe and Harbeck are also running on a platform of increased transparency for USG as well as greater collaboration with Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services to create a comprehensive sexual assault prevention plan.
Million, a junior majoring in neuroscience, rounds out the third presidential ticket with Timothy Vorhoff, a sophomore majoring in business who is running for vice president. Million is a first-generation college student whose parents immigrated from Ethiopia, a background that he said inspired him to run for office to help other students who may be facing socioeconomic difficulties. Vorhoff worked as the USG Director of Discretionary Funding this year.
“What we’re just trying to do is allow students to have more of an opportunity to have a voice,” Million said. “We want students to vote on things happening in the Undergraduate Student Government. Our campaign, our slogan and everything that we’re standing for is about giving students the opportunity that their voices are heard.”
Million and Vorhoff offer a platform that advocates for free printing cards for all students, food trucks on campus each week, extended hours for free Uber, a new fall break and extended Thanksgiving break, menstrual products in campus bathrooms and better recycling and composting programs. The Million-Vorhoff ticket also includes goals for improving disability services, implementing cultural sensitivity training and emphasizing sexual assault prevention training for students.
Thirteen candidates are running for 12 USG Senate openings. Tyler Matheson is the only current USG Senator who is running for re-election in the Senate.
According to Kat Lee, the associate director of elections for USC, all of the candidates are equipped to run successful campaigns.
“We want to make sure that people who are doing good work on this campus represent the organization,” Lee said. “I think the candidates this year demonstrate that.”
A Meet the Candidates event will take place Tuesday in TCC 227 at 8 p.m. A town hall-style debate between the candidates, with student-submitted questions, will take place Wednesday in the Wallis Annenberg Hall lobby at 8 p.m.

Outside The Reef in downtown Los Angeles, a line of blazer-clad, resume-toting men and women circled around building corners. Inside, a flurry of conversation emanated from jobseekers and employers interacting between brightly lit stalls. They were participants in TechFair LA, the biggest tech industry job fair held in Los Angeles on Thursday.
USC was an academic institution partner with the event.
Hoping to tap into an energetic and lucrative industry, 10,000 attendants registered for yesterday’s fair.
The event featured well-established companies as well as start-ups, and it’s these newly formed organizations that Dave Belasco, the co-director of the USC Lloyd Greif Center and an event speaker, said are most engaging.
“Entrepreneurship is a contact sport, it’s an all-consuming activity,” Belasco said. “It keeps you up at night; you think about whether you can make the payroll, whether you’ll raise enough money to get to the next stepping stone. You have to be comfortable with uncertainty and embrace failure.”
The idea for the fair originated from Jason Nazar, the co-founder and CEO of Comparably and the entrepreneur in residence for the City of Los Angeles. Nazar collaborated with Mayor Eric Garcetti to organize the nine-hour event, which attracted the participation of more than 250 companies, including YouTube, the Los Angeles Times and Tesla.
“The hard skills companies look for are centered around engineering, product design and performance marketing,” Nazar said. “The soft skills are [being] passionate, driven, hard-working.”
Although Silicon Valley has long been the epicenter for tech companies, Los Angeles has evolved its own tech ecosystem in recent years with startups like social media giant Snapchat and dating app Tinder. Both companies boast valuations in the billions.
Josh Brooks, the senior vice president of marketing at game developer Jam City, said that Los Angeles provides a favorable environment for startups to germinate revenue and recognition.
“In the last 10 years, the L.A. tech scene has gone from ‘something’ to ‘something really impressive,’” Brooks said. “That’s happened for a number of reasons: There are great schools like USC and UCLA focused on digital technology, there’s a significant amount of venture capitalist money here and you also have human capital.”
Ben Baysinger shares the view that human capital is abundant in Los Angeles. His company depends on it. He’s president and co-founder of HighRscout, a data science company that helps veterans start careers.
“There’s a huge pool of individuals with a wealth of experience here,” Baysinger said. “But sometimes, it can be difficult for companies to see how applicants could be a fit for them. So we’re hoping to expand networks and make that easier.”
According to Chris DeWolfe, the CEO of Jam City, the journey of envisioning a product and transforming it into reality can be tumultuous for aspiring entrepreneurs.
DeWolfe is familiar with embracing failure. He founded the social networking platform MySpace in 2003. While the website gained momentum for a few years, its popularity diminished greatly following the arrival of Facebook. After bouncing back from MySpace’s decline, DeWolfe went on to found SGN (now known as Jam City) in 2010.
“Passion’s gotta be there,” DeWolfe said. “Timing and work ethic have got to be there, and partnerships with people you trust have got to be there.”

Rick Caruso, a USC alumnus and businessman, has already been named “Developer of the Year” by the Los Angeles Business Journal and “Master Entrepreneur of the Year” by Ernst & Young LLP. His most recent award, though, comes from Pope Francis. Caruso has been awarded the Papal honor known as Knight Commander in the Order of the Knights of St. Gregory the Great.
Caruso received the award on Jan. 14 at Los Angeles Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels for his extraordinary life of service to the Catholic Church and to his community.
In recent years, Caruso’s service has primarily consisted of helping children who are underserved and underprivileged. His philanthropic efforts are focused on those children who lack the means to a proper education and health care.
“I feel strongly that kids need to have an opportunity to live a full, healthy and happy life,” Caruso said.
Founded in 1991, the Caruso Family Foundation has contributed to funding Operation Progress, a program that pairs students with Los Angeles Police Department mentors in South Los Angeles. This organization supports children who are living in housing tracts in that area.
The program’s collaboration with the police force ensures that children have a safe means of arriving to school in the mornings. Moreover, by providing full scholarships, Operation Progress also encourages students to advance their education.
Additionally, the Caruso Family Foundation supports Para Los Niños, an organization founded on Skid Row in 1980. Para Los Niños is a nonprofit social services organization that is committed to aiding Los Angeles’s disadvantaged families. The organization gives children from the ages of six months to 14 years an opportunity to obtain an education.
Caruso has also endowed $25 million dollars to USC’s otolaryngology department. This donation has provided researchers the resources to develop new methods to treat hearing loss among children who suffer diseases related to the ear, nose and throat. This department is now known as the Caruso Department of Otolaryngology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.
USC’s Catholic community has also benefitted from Caruso’s $7.5 million donation. The USC Caruso Catholic Center provides spiritual comfort for USC students.
“A lot of the service we do is done because of our faith, my belief system and what is important to us,” Caruso said.
Caruso intends to carry on his service work in the future.
“The future will be focused on those who do not have the same benefits the rest of us do,” Caruso said.
Caruso revealed that his faith and his belief in people plays a significant role in his desire to help the community. He plans to continue focusing his service work on health care through faith-based organizations in the future.
“All of the things we have in play, we are staying very engaged and very involved,” Caruso said.
According to Caruso, helping the community is a rewarding experience.
“We are all part of the same community here, and I really do believe that you are only as strong as the weakest point,” Caruso said. “We just have an obligation as human beings to lean in and help others.”
Caruso explained that his values are heavily based on helping others. He explains that he feels like he personally gains more from giving, compared to what he receives.
“You could always help other people who have less, and there are always people who have less or have a need,” Caruso said. “It may just be encouragement or a helping hand or friendship, but we should all be providing that because it’s part of being a member of the community.”
When asked about the qualities one should possess when striving for success, Caruso cited his success as the product of hard work and courage.
“Courage is one of my favorite words,” Caruso said. “Courage means you have fear, but you conquer your fear.”
Caruso also stressed the importance of maintaining a moral code. He believes that even in the competitive business world, dealings should be conducted with integrity, fairness and generosity. According to Caruso, such qualities will pay off in the long run.
Caruso encourages USC students to enjoy their time in college and to seize opportunities that come forth. He explained that students should graduate feeling like they have taken full advantage of the resources USC has to offer. He said students should hold onto their zest to learn in order to expand their range of interests and experiences.
“You never get those four years back,” Caruso said. “They will be four great years that will change your life and shape you in so many different ways.”

All the numbers suggested UCLA (19-3, 6-3) would thump USC (18-4, 5-4) on Wednesday night at the Galen Center, but the numbers were misleading.
The Trojans’ 84-76 victory was an anomaly. Redshirt sophomore forward Shaqquan Aaron, the seventh man off USC’s bench, led the game in scoring with 23 points. He more than doubled the total from UCLA’s top two scorers this season, senior guard Bryce Alford and freshman forward TJ Leaf — the third and sixth top scorers in the Pac-12, respectively.
“Shaqquan keeps getting better,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “He just made his mind up to play harder.”
The Louisville transfer started the first 15 games this season, but a prolonged shooting slump plagued him. In USC’s last six games, Aaron started just once, averaging only 18.6 minutes per game. On Wednesday, he overcame his slump, sparking the Trojan offense with 14 points in 13 minutes in the first half. The Trojans were plus-18 with him on the court.
Meanwhile, USC’s four freshmen committed one turnover while UCLA’s freshman trio gave up nine. UCLA freshman point guard Lonzo Ball, featured on the midseason Oscar Robertson National Player of the Year watchlist, committed a career-high seven turnovers. Entering the game, Ball had a 3.58 assist-to-turnover ratio — more than a full point better than any other Pac-12 guard. Yet, on Wednesday his ratio was 4-to-9 (.57).
The Trojans also had five double-digit scorers compared to UCLA’s four. For only the third time this season, the Bruins had less double digit scorers than their foes. They are now 0-3 in those games.
Bolstered by their high-scoring stars, USC notched 50 points in the first half for the first time this season. It was only the fourth half this season USC has eclipsed the 50-point mark in a half. Conversely, UCLA averages 93 points per game. Their 76 points was their tied-second lowest output this season.
After falling behind 8-0, USC tried its zone defense.
“It seemed to be working. We stuck with it the rest of the game. To hold them to 76 was an accomplishment,” Enfield said.
Making buckets from behind the line gave the Trojans the offensive advantage. USC scored 42 points from 14 3-pointers, more than double its season average. UCLA scored 18 points from 3-point range, 45 percent under their season average of 33.
“When your power forward is 6-foot-3, you better stretch the floor,” Enfield said. “You better make some threes.”
His team lost the battle in the paint 42-24 but managed to win by sticking to the gameplan.
“We had to play small and make some threes,” Enfield said. “Our point of emphasis was to contest the three.”
His team tied its season high with 14 total. UCLA made only six of 20.
Most surprising of all, freshman forward Harrison Henderson matched senior guard Bryce Alford with 3-point shots. When freshman forward Nick Rakocevic picked up his third foul with 2:02 to play in the first half, Enfield summoned Henderson.
Henderson’s late first-half cameo was the freshman’s fifth Pac-12 appearance. When he swished a high-arching three from the corner, even the Galen announcer was stunned.
“Eeeelijah Henderson!” he misspoke.
Though Henderson did not play in the second half, his 3-point shot crescendoed USC’s late first-half run that established them as the team to beat.
“Harrison Henderson deserves a lot of credit,” Enfield said. “He came in and wasn’t afraid of the moment.”
In comparison, Alford’s 3-point shooting was a season low. The senior averages over 17 points per game and ranks ninth all-time in the Pac-12 with 284 3-point field goals. Entering the game he already had 18 percent more 3-point field goals (71) than second-best in the league, ASU’s Torian Graham (60). But on Wednesday, he shot 1-of-5 from deep and 1-of-7 overall.
Prior to the game, USC’s 3-point defense ranked seventh in the Pac-12, and the Trojans had allowed 173 threes — tied second worst in the league with UCLA. In their previous two games, Arizona and Arizona State made 19 3-point buckets.
The difference behind Wednesday’s deviations and the season’s standards might be traced to the capacity crowd at the Galen Center.
“I just wish it was like this every night,” sophomore forward Chimezie Metu said.
The Galen Center was averaging 3,693 patrons at 12 men’s basketball games prior to Wednesday’s event. Against UCLA, the arena was filled with 10,000-plus — just another anomaly.
“The energy before the game and throughout the game was the best I’ve ever seen,” Enfield said. “I’ve been coaching for 22 years. It’s as good as any environment I’ve seen.”
While the win counts as just one victory for the Trojans and one loss for the Bruins, Enfield hopes it means more to the fans.
“I think [the win] means more for everyone in this building tonight,” Enfield said. “If you’re a USC fan, you can come here and have some fun. Any time you sell the Galen Center out and have all the students here and the fans, this is a big time college atmosphere.”
A big-time college atmosphere deserves a big-time team. With recent wins versus Arizona State and UCLA, the Trojans are challenging college basketball’s West Coast hegemony. But to prove that Wednesday’s win was not a rarity, USC has a ways to go.

It was early in the second half, and USC was ahead by double-digits when the chants started at the Galen Center.
“Overrated,” they bellowed, softly at first but soon turning into a stadium-wide jeer aimed at No. 8 UCLA, which USC took down on Wednesday in front of a sold-out, raucous crowd of 10,258 people.
But the crowd wasn’t done having fun. They chanted, “Thank you, Lonzo” when Bruins freshman phenom Lonzo Ball missed a pair of free throws that gave all fans free Chick-Fil-A. Then, with five minutes to play, the “overrated” chants started again, sandwiched in between a high-flying putback jam by junior guard Elijah Stewart and an and-one dunk by sophomore forward Chimezie Metu.
And, for good measure, with the game out of reach in the final minutes, “Just like football” rained down, a gleeful reference to the 36-14 beatdown that USC’s football team put on UCLA in Pasadena last November.
Take a moment to appreciate what happened on Wednesday night at the Galen Center. There it was, a crowd actually getting into a non-football USC sport, the most excited a basketball home crowd has been in some time.
While it’s unlikely that the energy for future games will eclipse that of a matchup against a crosstown rival, USC has to hope that what occurred both on the court and in the stands against UCLA serves as a blueprint for the remainder of the season.
“It was great,” Metu said about the sellout crowd. “I just wish it was like that every game.”
“That,” as in the line for students to enter the arena wrapping around the stadium, the usually half-empty section of the stadium filling up an hour before tip-off, tickets for the game selling out a month beforehand, the parking lots around Galen Center displaying “FULL” signs and traffic on the nearby surface streets slowing to an absolute crawl.
Inside, it was just as spectacular. USC beat UCLA for the sixth straight time in men’s basketball or football — four in a row men’s hoops — and the Trojan faithful rubbed it in as much as they could. The capacity crowd cheered and chanted without being prompted by DJ Mal-ski, who typically has to encourage fans to make noise.
“This was as good an atmosphere as I’ve seen,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “It was just a great college basketball environment … This atmosphere was just sensational.”
On the court, it was like the teams switched jerseys. The Bruins and their high-powered offense — that ranks third in the NCAA in scoring at 92.2 points per game — were held to just 76. The Trojans, who have struggled shooting the ball early in conference play, drilled nine 3-pointers in the first half alone en route to dropping 50 on the Bruins at halftime.
It didn’t start out that well. USC trailed 8-0 right off the bat, looking jumpy and over-amped, while an emphatic follow jam by Ball had the crowd oohing and aahing. But after going down 20-10, it was like a light switch went off for the Trojans. There were steals and dunks, alley-oops and hustle plays and a whole lot of the net swishing from long distance.
Like that, the game was tied, and then USC went ahead. Before you knew it, Stewart drilled a deep 3-pointer at the first half buzzer to put the Trojans up by double-digits, sending a dejected Bruins team to the locker room.
By the end of the game, USC had sent UCLA into low-key panic mode. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Bruins stayed in the locker room for nearly half an hour after the game, holding a lengthy team meeting.
Maybe this UCLA team isn’t as good as everyone thought it would be (the Bruins also lost to Arizona last Saturday) when it was hyped as a national championship contender, and Ball — who scored 15 points but committed a whopping seven turnovers — still needs time to develop after being heralded as the next big thing. Perhaps he still is. And perhaps the Bruins simply had an off night.
The Trojans can’t think about that, though. They have to take the momentum off this win against a top-10 opponent and hope that it translates to another win in Washington next week. Given their inconsistent conference play following a 13-0 start, this could potentially be a season-defining win that sparks a late-season push for a better Pac-12 and NCAA tournament seeding.
And hopefully, went they return home on Feb. 9 to play Oregon State, the Galen Center will be just as energized as it was against UCLA. Both the team and the crowd — as the kids say — were absolutely “lit” on Wednesday. Now, it’s all about keeping the fuse burning.

Despite a loss to UCLA on Sunday, the women’s basketball team did not go down easily. They showed a different side than in previous games, giving hope that their next two games against Arizona and Arizona State this weekend will be the ones to jump-start them back to consecutive wins.
“Every game now is a chance for us to bounce back,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “We got better against UCLA, played better against UCLA, but now we have to put that effort into every game we play and we’ll come away with some wins. We’ve got to translate some of the steps we have taken and some of the things we have gotten better in into wins.”
After losing seven games in a row — some close and some not —- the mental battle becomes a prominent factor in how the team does the rest of the season. For the Trojans, the second half of the season could easily slip away from them if the players and the coaches lose confidence in their abilities. However, according to freshman guard Minyon Moore, the team focuses on certain aspects to keep their spirits alive.
“[We have to stay] positive and not stay down on ourselves,” Moore said. “It’a just always saying, ‘We have a next game, a next game to get it to come together.’ We need to come together as a team and get a win. Wins heal everything, so we just need to pull it together.”
Pulling it together has proved difficult for the Trojans. While their play shows flashes of intensity and teamwork, the inconsistency of the young team has plagued its ability to come away with victories. With countless injuries and few upperclassmen leaders, the team has been shaky at times. Ultimately, Cooper-Dyke believes that her young squad has the talent to go far in this conference if she can rein in its youth and turn development into wins.
“We’ve shown that we have the ability,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We just have to be consistent and it sometimes is difficult when you have five freshmen and a couple sophomores and a couple injuries, but we are in the middle of the top conference in the nation. We’ve got to make sure that we are coming to play every night.”
One of the players making a difference for the team is senior guard Courtney Jaco. She averages 13.9 points per game in conference, scoring 27 points the first time playing UCLA and 18 the second. It is not just her scoring that has made a huge impact on the team, but also her leadership on and off the court. With such a young team, the example she sets now will be passed down to future Trojans as well as the ones playing right now.
“She is such a role model,” Moore said. “I tell her every day that I strive to be like her every day. Not just her athletic ability, but her leadership. It is just great being under her and seeing her leadership as a freshman, and having an example to follow for later years.”
With Jaco leading the way, the Trojans will host Arizona on Friday at 7 p.m. and ASU on Sunday at 3 p.m.

A recent New York Times investigation revealed just how elite USC is. According to the analysis, a whopping 13.9 percent of students come from the top 1 percent of the income scale — meaning that their families make over $630,000 per year. At the same time, only 21.9 percent of students come from the bottom 60 percent, which encompasses families earning less than $65,000 per year. Socioeconomic disparities continue to plague students’ access to higher education on a national scale at our University.
This discovery highlights the immense work needed to be done to make college more accessible for everyone. Though USC has made admirable strides in recent years, these statistics present an opportunity for the University to be a pioneer in the field.
In 38 elite colleges throughout the United States, student populations are skewed in favor of rich students. For those looking to make a better life for themselves, this can be especially disheartening. Higher education represents the best chance for social mobility for many students, but a lack of accessibility and affordability obliterates dreams before they can even take off.
Fortunately, USC has taken steps to counter this trend and falls outside of the 38 universities spotlighted by the survey. One in four Trojans qualifies for a Pell Grant given by the federal financial aid program for students, and USC’s Neighborhood Academic Initiative enrolls over 1,000 local students from 6th to 12th grade in a program that facilitates the journey to college. On top of this, 70 percent of USC students receive some form of financial aid. And first-generation college students formed 13 percent of the freshman class this fall.
Yet there is much more to be done. USC pales in comparison to other universities that actively recruit students from lower-income households. At Vassar College, the university is not only dedicated to actively recruiting low-income students but is also committed to decreasing the financial burden of these students while they are in college. In 2015, Tufts University announced that they will actively and openly recruit DREAMers, undocumented students who have been in the United States since the age of five. USC should also look to public universities — the City University of New York returns tuition money to the families of undocumented backgrounds. The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill hosts the Carolina Covenant, a program that ensures that children from low-income families graduate debt-free.
This underrepresentation of low-income students perpetuates economic inequality and a revolving door of exclusion and poverty. From a young age, many are taught that “hard work pays off.” But when high-achieving students are barred from college just because of pre-existing economic conditions, achievement is just a farce with no utility. The potential to succeed — to be a part of a well-connected network, study in well-stocked libraries and attend enriching student programming — is ultimately stripped.
As a university that welcomes people of diverse backgrounds to our Trojan Family, USC faces many obstacles to help every student succeed. Diversity, a core Trojan value, does not only encompass race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, veteran status or national origin — it also includes socioeconomic diversity that allows students from different backgrounds to talk to each other and learn from people who have had different life experiences.
The University should emerge as a leader in enhancing its commitment to an economically diverse student body. During the admissions process, it can weigh applicants from underprivileged areas more heavily than it does now. But greater than that, it can contribute to more cohesive community development. And it can create stronger institutional pipelines to low-income schools.
For many people at this University, matriculation might be the norm, and those from the college preparation feeder system have a clear advantage. It’s time to change that.
Daily Trojan Spring 2017 Editorial Board
Just a tiny bit of effort in your editorial comments would help. 
Right after your paragraph touting how well USC is doing on these issues, 25% Pell, etc… you move on to say others are doing so much better:
“USC pales in comparison to other universities that actively recruit students from lower-income households”
Your examples: are Tufts and Vassar.  Vassar with its apparently amazing programs t is at 25% pell.  Tufts is at 12% pell.  Pretty sure that matching performance at one and doubling the performance at the other doesn’t exactly support your thesis that “USC pales in comparison…”
There are plently of controversial topics that you could use to generate readership.  It is just lazy journalism to manufacture a controversy to write about and it is plain old sloppy work to pick one that demonstrably wrong.

Change is often not as inevitable as we would like. It seems, sometimes, to a generation enjoying as a birthright civic and political privileges which our forefathers could have only dreamed, that much of our fighting is done. The Civil Rights Movement won, women can vote, we are no longer sending boys to Vietnam and abortion is legal. The truth that this generation is facing now, and perhaps for the first time with the rise of Trump and his brand of reactionary ultra-conservatism and knee-jerk nationalistic anti-politics, is that these achievements can be rolled back in even shorter time than they could be won.
Already, executive orders have launched attacks on women’s bodies, roaring out of a cradle of medieval ideologies; our long-sought and long-fought, semi-amicable economic partnership with China is being immolated so our President can puff up his chest. Our health care, upon which millions of Americans so desperately rely, has been trashed in the name of false reasoning and propagandist fake economics — mostly because its creator was a black Democrat. The new administration has convinced its zealots that our press is our pariah.
Last Saturday, a million women across the country marched for the protection of their rights, their health care, their futures, their children’s futures, their first amendment rights, their equal protection under the law, the sanctity of their marriage and the equality of their gender. They marched for the discernible and tangible future of a nation that, for eight years, seemed to seek so freely and so desperately to be comparable to its first-world contemporaries, both in the quality of life of its citizens and the opportunity of its children. Nothing could crush them. Perhaps some Trumpians showed up to the inauguration in USA scarves and Make America Great Again hats; the rest of the nation, however, was hot, angry, livid, piercing, betrayed, scared, hopeful, determined and pensive — waiting to march.
And we must not forget it. Students, especially, turned out in droves to women’s marches across the nation, in every city. If we are to believe, as our parents once did, that our generation will be the one to actively inherit the nation, we too must rejoice in the responsibility to take care of it. We must march, as we did, and we must not forget that we must march again, and again and again. Do not forget the Women’s March; take real, tangible and important action in politics policy, the local community and civic life. Call your representatives. Petition your councilmen and women, and never allow the voice of the people to be drained out by the rhetoric of men who still believe that their race is superior and their wives should be ironing clothes.
What if the French third estate had stopped after Bastille Day? What if the revolutionaries had hung up their hats, quartered the soldiers and paid their blood in taxes? What if Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the movement for civil rights had ended at Selma? What if Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton had been satisfied with passive representation? What if, throughout the course of world history, nobody had stood up and said, “No” — where would we be?
The Women’s March is a drop in the ocean if it doesn’t continue. These are the congressional Republicans who were not moved by black children dying in the streets; they were not moved by the human necessity of gay Americans to finally behold equal rights; they were not moved when children were murdered in Newtown or when the uninsured and the unemployed and the homeless starved in their streets, in their towns and in their states; make no mistake, they will not be moved by the Women’s March — unless the Women’s March represents a great change in our political history, a time in which the 54 percent of this country that did not want Donald Trump ever to be called “President” unleashed the full power and force of the will of the people. Our free press is being threatened by the very man who seeks to benefit if and when it dies. The sanctity of our democracy is being threatened by a regime that saw fit to allow a foreign enemy state to influence our sovereign elections. The freedoms of our daughters are being erased before our very eyes. Who will passively and lamely watch them go — and who will stand in the way? If our generation has encountered its fight, which I believe it has, that is the question. That is what we must know.
To be angry, to complain, to scream and shout is one thing — it’s natural, it’s warranted and it’s good. But the real work is not glamorous. It is not what they will make movies about. It is not beautiful or inspiring. But it is the only thing that will make change. To plan, to march, to protest, to petition, to call, to wait, to read constantly, to think constantly and to be aware and focused and ready — that is what makes the dreams of a nation become the reality of the state.

Thankfully, this is an opinion piece and not a report based on facts. And your creative writing class has helped,  UT your statements are wrong and based on propaganda from the Left.  Now, you might be politically aligned to the Left and not a true liberal. I get it. Constitutional liberalism is dead. The Democratic Party has been taken over by anarchists and far left leaning “liberals”.   Someday, when you grow up, have a real,job and have been in the workforce for 10 years or so, you’ll realize truly where your heart lies.  Left leaning anarchy is evil, as is much of the Dem Party these days, and that’s too bad.  Remember, liberalism today does nothing for you other than they want power and control over you. They want to have big government so that they will,own you throw high taxes, intrusive gov regulations, keeping you down and out and on entitlement programs.  They want you to think you are receiving benefits formfree, but nothing is free.  You and your peers will,pay the price.
Trump and the GOP want to make life better for Americans, not own you, not control you, but to empower you to have the life you want.  
And lastly, abortion as a means of birth control is murder. Plain and simple. You want the gov out of your lives, then you’ll agree that Roe v Wade should be abolished.  Abortion as a medical procedure in the case of the life or death of the mother is a different policy. You either want to get pregnant or you dont.  It’s your choice to use birth control. There are 20+ methods available,  so getting pregnant or not is up to you.  Deal with it as most people do a round the world. It’s ironic that folks like you push for greater protections again the cruel to animals than a human life. How twisted is that?
You have been emotionally manipulated by the Left for so many years, it’s no wonder our young people are snowflakes.

The stage lights in the Sayers Club on Hollywood Boulevard shed a dim magenta hue on an empty stage with a living room setup. A group of approximately 50 young adults lounged in surrounding leather couches and at the bar, laughing and making small talk as Kanye West’s “Fade” played in a slower remix in the background. At 9 p.m., a tall man entered the stage, and the crowd quieted down. This man was Jason White, the head of marketing at Beats by Dr. Dre.
“I have the privilege of introducing to you an artist who is trying to break into the U.S. market,” White said. “She loves her craft; she pursues her craft, and that’s what we love about her. Please welcome Leah Dou.”
Dou, a Chinese singer-songwriter, is the daughter of prominent Chinese singers Dou Wei and Faye Wong. Unlike her parents’ music, however, Dou’s songs are primarily in English. Rather than conforming to the typical Chinese traditional style, it takes on a neo-soul, almost dream-pop genre with an ethereal twist.
Julia Erickson | Daily Trojan
Dou’s L.A. debut began with a promotional video made in collaboration with Beats. The video, titled “The Way I Am,” featured three protagonists and their journeys home for Chinese New Year. The six-minute video followed two plot lines: one in which two individuals found a way to see each other through video call, and another that  featured a young man dealing with logistical challenges to make his way back to his family.
In the background track of the video, Dou’s “It’s Not a Crime, It’s Just What We Do” played to accompany the storyline, and the scenes flashed from the couple to the young man back to Dou’s first performance in Los Angeles — revealing each person’s inner obstacles in their goals of reaching home.
“The film is a story about all the struggles and excitement and wins and losses about going home,” White said. “Chinese New Year is a time when everyone thinks of home, and this video is really for all the young people out in the world trying to live a new life while adhering to tradition.”
Following the promotional video, Dou performed a couple of the songs on her debut album, Stone Café, including “Chimes,” “Bitter Sweet,” “Blue Flamingo,” “River Run,” “May Rain” and “My Days.”
While some of her songs such as “River Run” and “My Days” displayed energetic electronic beats and harmony, Dou’s music features soulful melodies accompanied with poetic lyrics. Complemented with her haunting, deep voice, Dou’s songs stood out from the typical expected Chinese pop while also diverging from her mother’s signature adherence to Chinese musical conventions.
As Dou tries to make a name for herself, she struggles with her previous identity as the daughter of one of the most famous singers in China. This inspires her to pursue a new, alternative route on her journey to stardom. As a result, Dou’s first album, Stone Café, reveals some of the inner turmoils Chinese millennials face and explicitly confronts uncomfortable emotions. This style of honesty in her music is rarely heard in Chinese vanilla pop and other traditional genres; these elements distinguish Dou’s music from the mainstream styles, marking Dou as an artist to watch not only in China but also in the United States.

I met Johnny in the bookstore. He was going up the escalator as I went down when he called out to me. He shouted down to me: “I love your dress! I live in Parkside too!” For a couple weeks I’d catch him coming and going, and he’d always warmly greet me with,“Hey polka-dot dress girl!”
It turned out we were on the same floor, and for the rest of my freshman year, my door was almost always wide open with the sole purpose of letting Johnny come and go as he pleased.
Mia was Johnny’s friend first. I don’t remember when we met; I think we bonded over Beyoncé. We all went to the beach together one day in January and, from then on, my door was open to her too.
I thought I’d found my people.
I went to a prestigious high school in New England. It was, in the classic sense, a college preparatory school, and I had been groomed for years to find a university that was not only well-respected but also a perfect fit.
Part of the perfect fit, the narrative suggested, was the incredible group of friends who matched your intellect and pushed your buttons in all the right ways. I thought Johnny and Mia could be this for me. We’d discuss feminism and contemporary art, along with our sex lives, in vulgar detail. We’d get drunk together and push each other into the arms of strangers. We supported each other through mental illness and even the passing of a loved one. Perhaps it was ill-fated, but it was also toxic from the start.
Before Johnny and Mia, I didn’t isolate myself in social hierarchy. But Johnny, Mia and I became so fixated on our brand of Tumblr-approved detached social interaction that we felt superior. I still apologize to people from my freshman floor when I see them around, hoping to make up for all the closed doors and cold expressions I so casually shut myself behind in those halls.
We were happy. We would laugh all night and dance until 5 a.m.
I got a boyfriend in January, and the two of them encouraged much of the relationship. They were definitely most interested in his chiseled muscles and Italian accent. Beyond that, they expressed doubt. I dove into a relationship as they encouraged a hook-up situation or even cheating. When I decided to make the commitment to long distance, Johnny insisted I move not too quickly.
The boyfriend and I had our issues, but Johnny and Mia didn’t know. I don’t quite understand what made them so committed to stopping us.
Over the summer between freshman and sophomore year, we talked a fair amount. I still ask myself whether what was to come in the fall was a result of my not calling Mia enough. I still worry if it was because I was not supportive enough as she grieved for her loved one. Mia talked a lot about wanting to come back to Los Angeles; she was bored staying at home all summer.
I knew she was going to join a sorority, and I thought about it, but decided not to. We made plans with Johnny for the Friday before the first day of classes. That’s the last I ever spent time with them.
Nothing happened that Friday that was out of the ordinary, nothing to suggest we’d never even share a smile after that night. Weeks later, we got drunk, and we caught up. Mia talked about her new sorority. Johnny talked about boys. I thought we were still friends.
On Oct. 14, Johnny and I had concert tickets. On Oct. 12, I realized I hadn’t seen him since that night in August. He never returned my texts asking to hang out, and once, I even saw him leaving my apartment building and he didn’t look me in the eyes. Mia was missing too, and I knew I had to ask if they were coming back.
So I made it clear that I no longer wanted my messages ignored, and asked one final time if he wanted the ticket or not. He backed out, and I knew that was it.
I saw the two of them walking together on campus a month later, and they kept their eyes on the ground.
Losing a friendship can be worse than a romantic broken heart because friends don’t feel the need to break up with you. They can simply disappear. Johnny and Mia didn’t do anything out of the ordinary, and probably don’t think they did anything wrong. There’s a difference between growing apart and cutting someone off, but the standard of our age group says detaching is OK.
Because of this standard, I still lack answers, even for this column.

Q: I don’t feel like I belong to any particular friend group. What should I do?
Quite frankly, I think groups are limiting. When people situate themselves in a “friend group,” they may neglect potential new friendships that could change the course of their lives.
Dramatic, I know. But, I do think we often miss opportunities to forge relationships with new — and often, amazing — people because we don’t want to expand our circles.
I want you to know that you don’t have to belong to a particular group to have good friends. The most meaningful friendships are born out of true connections. Even in large friend groups, I see smaller cliques form. If you’re a new student on campus, I don’t think you should be focused on finding a right group. If it happens, it happens. Focus on making good friends. Just because you don’t belong to a singular friend group doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t have fruitful friendships.
Find friends that last. And to do that, I think you should establish what you want in any relationship. What type of friendship are you striving for? What do you want out of a particular friendship? Do you want someone to go on an adventure with you? Or do you want someone to emotionally vent to? We all need different people in our lives for different reasons. Focusing on finding a group where you have shallow relationships with five other people rather than focusing on friends that make you innately happy is a waste of time. Harsh, I know, but I’m just being honest. 
Also, groups come at the most random times in life. So, don’t search for a group. Search for friends, and groups will eventually form. Strive for meaningful relationships. It’ll last longer!

Last year, when I first began my chapter of life at USC, everything was new and exciting. Coming from Seattle, I was especially excited about the constant sunny days and the opportunity to develop a never-ending tan. I remember making a bucket list of everything that I wanted to accomplish during my freshman year. Items on this list included places I wanted to visit, such as: Manhattan Beach, Venice Beach, Universal Studios and Beverly Hills. It included trendy restaurants that I wanted to eat at because celebrities were often spotted there and nightclubs that I wanted to go to, again due to the possibility of spotting a celebrity. Every event that I attended and place that I was able to check off of my bucket list gave me a high. I wanted to keep exploring and keep this high. Los Angeles was my place. As freshman year drew to a close, I realized that I did not want to return to Seattle. I did not want to leave this magical place for the entire summer. 
Fast forward to winter break of this year. I spent the entire month in Seattle with my family, friends and the rain. Break was a time for me to relax and catch up on sleep. It was a time to destress and reflect on my previous semester. 
My Seattle friends couldn’t contain their excitement and jealousy as I told them about all of the fun things I had done during fall semester this year. They wanted to hear all about the people that I had met, the places I had explored and the outings I had done. My friends expressed to me that I was living a life right out of a TV show, a dream life. It was this exact conversation that caused me to recognize the now very evident ways in which I had changed as a person since summer break. After one and a half years of living here, Los Angeles had finally become a reality to me. It was no longer a fantasy. I realized that I take the weather for granted, the beaches for granted, USC for granted and the events that I attend for granted. I have adjusted to the LA lifestyle. 
Writing this blog has given me the opportunity to take a step back and realize how fortunate I am. Instead of taking Los Angeles and all that it has for granted, I want to truly appreciate this city for what it is. I may feel adjusted to my lifestyle here, but that does not mean that I should ever stop exploring.

Making meaningful friends your first semester can be an extremely difficult thing as a freshman. Finding your tribe or your niche of people that you can easily relate to is something that takes time, and I did not fully understand that during my first semester. During the first few of weeks of classes first semester, I missed my friends from high school and my life at home so much, and all the new friendships I was making felt so superficial. I had such a solid group of best friends in high school, and I felt utterly lost and confused why I didn’t have that immediately starting school. Looking back at myself now, I was being extremely irrational because the friendships I had in high school started at such a young age, and they had years to grow and evolve. Regardless, at the time, it was very difficult for me to accept, and I wondered what was wrong with me. The song “WHERE THE HELL ARE MY FRIENDS” by LANY became my go-to when I would have an angst-filled day. 

The reality is that friendships will inevitably be superficial when you first start to meet people: it is important to accept that you are not going to have a cohesive group of friends right when you get to college. Just being patient and not putting pressure on yourself will bring you the greatest returns, and that fact was very hard for me to swallow. Like Bob Marley said and as quoted in the photo, “Don’t complicate your mind.” When I came back for my second semester, I already felt that my friendships had become stronger than they were before, and I felt the superficial barriers break. This was a social aspect of college that no one had prepared me for or told me to expect in high school, and as I mentioned in my previous post, the deceptiveness of social media made me think my friends from high school at different colleges had all found close friends immediately.
My advice to my fellow freshmen is to try new things, to join new clubs, and to put themselves out there as much as they can to fill that gap of not having a niche. Just put faith in the fact that we go to school with an undergraduate population of 19,000, so you are bound to find people you genuinely connect with soon. Like my orientation advisor wisely said, “You can’t make a small campus big, but you can make a big campus small.”

A USC team which has established an identity for itself as either a strong starter or solid finisher of games — but never both — put together its most complete performance of the season Wednesday night as it defeated No. 8 UCLA, 84-76, at the Galen Center. 
The Trojans (18-4, 5-4) have now won their last four games against UCLA, dating back to last season. 
After falling behind 8-0 early on in regulation, USC stormed back in the first half to take a lead it would never relinquish. A 3-pointer from redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron put the Trojans ahead of UCLA, 29-28, with 12 minutes remaining in the first half. It was the only lead change of the game, and it was in favor of USC.
“Big games, big stage, this is the kind of game where I want to step up,” Aaron said. “I feel comfortable on most nights shooting, but tonight the shots were just falling and I kept putting up the ball.”
Aaron was the game-high scorer Wednesday night, as he recorded a career-best 23 points against the Bruins (19-3, 6-3). He finished the game shooting 4-of-9 from beyond the 3-point line and was 6-for-12 from the field overall. 
After a 3-pointer from junior guard Elijah Stewart early in the second half, the Trojans took their largest lead of the night at 56-41 with 18:05 remaining in regulation. 
Stewart also hit a 3-point field goal just before the halftime buzzer to give USC a 50-38 lead at the half. The Bruins trailed USC by double-digits at the break despite shooting 16-for-29 from the field in the opening period of play. 
Entering the game, UCLA was averaging 11.9 turnovers per game offensively. In the first half alone against USC, the Bruins committed 13 turnovers. 
USC capitalized off of UCLA’s offensive lapses in the first half, as they outscored the Bruins in points off of turnovers, 14-2, to open the game. Overall, USC recorded 12 steals defensively Wednesday night. 
“Our team has always tried to steal possessions away from opponents this season,” Enfield said. “We’ve had to grind some games out this season … we’ve had to make steals, grab rebounds, block shots and at the same time limit the turnovers on our end offensively. We’ve been able to minimize turnovers, too.”
USC held UCLA senior guard Bryce Alford to 3 points on 1-of-7 shooting. Entering the game against the Trojans, Alford was leading the Bruins in scoring this season, averaging 17.2 points per game.
The Trojans held a UCLA team that was shooting above 43 percent from the 3-point line to a 6-of-20 performance from beyond the arc. USC freshman guard De’Anthony Melton put together a well-rounded performance in his first career game against UCLA. Melton flirted with a triple-double as he scored 13 points, recorded five assists and hauled in a team-high nine rebounds.. 
A 3-pointer from Melton with four minutes remaining put USC ahead by 10 points and helped thwart a late UCLA comeback attempt. 
“We’ve dealt with a lot of personnel losses this season,” Enfield said. “We wouldn’t be 18-4 if it weren’t for the guys we have right now that are playing very well for us.”
As a team, USC finished the game shooting 14-for-34  from the 3-point line. Overall, the Trojans shot 27-of -67  from the field against the Bruins. 
USC’s bench, which was led by Aaron’s career-scoring night, outscored the UCLA bench, 30-17. The Trojans came away with the victory Wednesday night despite being outscored in the paint by UCLA, 42-24. 
UCLA standout freshman guard Lonzo Ball recorded a double-double against the Trojans, totaling 15 points, 10 rebounds and four assists in his team’s loss. For the first time this season, the Galen Center was at full-capacity attendance-wise, as 10,258 fans made their way to the Trojans’ home arena to watch them take on UCLA.
“It always feels good to be able to beat our rivals in a big game like tonight’s,” said Metu, who also finished with seven rebounds. 
USC will now take the road to face Washington on Feb. 1.
Props to Enfield and his team. They were prepared, and played a complete game. The Bruins can not expect to just out score their opponents every time. Defensive stops win games.

On Tuesday, the 2017 Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association placed the Trojans at the top of the country’s competition, awarding the team the maximum of 64 points and eight first-place votes. After winning the MPSF championship last season, USC became the first team from the conference to reach the NCAA quarterfinals. 
Last year’s squad also set milestones with 20 consecutive victories, setting the conference records for total wins and winning streak. The team finished with a No. 5 ranking in the final IWLCA Poll.
This is the first time in the team’s five years on campus that it has started with a predicted finish of a championship victory. The Trojans were chosen over Stanford, which came in second place, along with Colorado and Oregon. Stanford was the only other team to receive a single first-place vote besides the Trojans and received 56 total points in the poll.
This year, each team in the MPSF league will play in an eight-team round-robin schedule. The schedule will be slightly altered after last year’s departure of Denver, which now is part of the Big East conference.
After the best finish in the school’s history, the Trojans will return a core unit of players from last year’s team. Junior goalkeeper Gussie Johns will return in goal after securing a spot on the U.S. national team and leading the nation in goals-against average last season. The team will also return two players from last year’s defense, which was ranked No. 1 in the country. Senior defender Nina Kelty and junior midfielder Lydia Sutton will both look to protect the net for the Trojans.
Also returning will be all-time leading scorer and 2015 MPSF Player of the Year Michaela Michael, along with senior attacker Kylie Drexel. The team will take to McAlister Field for the first time on Feb. 11 against Saint Mary’s College, looking to defend their new place at the top of the nation’s rankings.

The NFL conference championships were settled last weekend, which means it’s now time to revisit the time-honored tradition of trashing the Pro Bowl, which will take place this Sunday in Orlando.
Are you rolling your eyes? Are you muttering something under your breath about beating a dead horse?
I don’t blame you. But no matter how long the discussion has gone on, it still isn’t over —
not as long as the league continues to rework the format of football’s All-Star game in an attempt to salvage what is perhaps the most boring exhibition game in all of sports.
The Pro Bowl in its current form, when the “top” players from each conference go “toe-to-toe” on the field (provided they aren’t injured or playing in the Super Bowl), may be completely unsalvageable.
Football is a unique sport among America’s Big Four — football, basketball, baseball and hockey — in that it inherently, unequivocally stinks at half-speed. Pro Bowl participants are more concerned about their health than the outcome of the game (and rightly so), and the spectacle devolves into a glorified scrimmage.
This near-absence of contact is a massive hurdle, but one hockey appears to have solved in recent years. The NHL is the only major American sports league with a rising viewership for its All-Star festivities, which will coincidentally also take place this weekend. Unsurprisingly then, the NFL has emulated hockey to spice up the Pro Bowl, but the league has chosen to borrow aspects that so far aren’t the ones that draw in the audience.
First, there was the thoroughly uninteresting fantasy draft format, which was just scrapped this season after a three-year test run. Two NFL Hall of Famers (Jerry Rice and Michael Irvin in the most recent Pro Bowl) would alternate picks to assemble their rosters — which merely resulted in a randomly shuffled version of
the typical NFC vs. AFC format.
The NHL abandoned that system after 2015, since the only appeal behind the draft was to watch the All-Stars get drunk while picking their teams (the Pro Bowl version was alcohol-less and even more boring).
This year, the NFL has copied the NHL’s skills competition, which the league first did in the early 2000s before getting rid of it in 2008 (and reinstating it again this season). In the “Skills Showdown,” players will take part in challenging drills and mini-games such as precision passing and dodgeball the day before the actual Pro Bowl.
But hockey has had the skills competition for some time now, even while it endured sinking All-Star Game ratings. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell should take a close look at what really saved the NHL All-Star Game, the 3-on-3 tournament, when looking for a way to make the Pro Bowl relevant to football fans.
Hockey’s 3-on-3 format selects three All-Stars from each division and pits the divisions against one another in a knockout tournament, with a cash prize for the winning team. This works for a number of reasons: Most significantly, the miniscule roster sizes for each team means there is a bigger sense of camaraderie among the players, and they seem to legitimately want to win the tournament. 
It also helps that 3-on-3 results in a much faster pace of play, more open ice and very few hits, if any at all. The fact that each game is truncated to two 10-minute halves instead of the usual three 20-minute periods also makes it much more appealing to a television audience. Put in the simplest terms, it feels like the best hockey players in the world are playing in a very expensive pickup tournament just for fun. Who doesn’t want to watch that?
I think you could apply a similar format to great effect in the NFL. Why not take each division in every conference and organize a 7-on-7 tournament in lieu of a traditional Pro Bowl? Players would no longer have to fake hitting each other, and watching the likes of quarterback Drew Brees and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. play backyard football would be thrilling. 
Like in the NHL, not all players would be represented in the tournament, but everyone could participate in either 7-on-7 or the skills competition,  both of which entertaining.
This change would solve a large number of the Pro Bowl’s problems in one fell swoop. Play would no longer go at half-speed out of fear of injury, a meaningless game wouldn’t drag on for hours and the games wouldn’t feel so meaningless in the first place. Above all, it would be fun, which is what an All-Star weekend is supposed to be about anyway. 
I know it’s a radical suggestion, but go ahead and watch this year’s Pro Bowl and tell me it’s not in need of radical change. Seriously, watch it and tell me how it goes. I’ll be too busy watching the 3-on-3 tournament going on in the Staples Center.

After a rivalry loss to UCLA last week, the men’s volleyball team looks to continue learning from its mistakes in order to bounce back before heading up north to take on No. 8 Stanford on Thursday. 
“Our preparation has still been about learning volleyball, developing the mentality, being engaged, being ready, learning the IQ, working on some of the techniques that we have been trying to hone and trying to drill in them and taking it to the next level,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said.
Even with reinforcement from the coaches on the basics, the Trojans will find Stanford to be a difficult team to defeat if they do not take it to that next level. The Cardinals thrived in their opening game in MPSF play against Pepperdine with a team season high of 46 digs, a career high 21 kills for freshman outside hitter Jordan Ewert and a career bests in assists (45) and digs (11) for freshman setter Paul Bischoff.
“They just have a good brand of volleyball,” Nygaard said. “Their strength has always been passing and offensive system. There are going to be five attackers against three blockers when they do their system well.”
Despite the impressive stats from Stanford’s last game, Nygaard is making sure the team keeps its focus on its side of the net. If they do this, Nygaard hopes his team will put pressure on Stanford and force them to make the plays instead of handing them free points from errors on their side. 
“It is just a question of if you execute at a high level,” Nygaard said. “They are going to do some things that you probably haven’t seen before, but you’ve still got to compete. We are talking about the top-tier teams, so you’re not going to shut anybody down. You just need to play and keep them at a certain level, and then you need to be above that level to give yourself a shot.” 
That competitive edge just might come from 6-foot-2 community college transfer Gianluca Grasso, who has officially joined the team and might be able to play on Thursday. The team staff has been working for over a year to get Grasso to USC,  and it is finally becoming a reality. 
Hailing from Sao Paolo, Brazil, Grasso was named the All-Pacific Coast Conference Co-MVP playing for Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa last year. Grasso has volleyball in his blood, as his two siblings played volleyball in college, and both of his parents played for Brazil’s national teams. While he still needs to get used to the team’s system and fight for a starting position, Nygaard believes that the addition of Grasso would be beneficial for the team as a whole.
“He just comes in with that intimate knowledge of how volleyball works,” Nygaard said. “He has just been around it and inundated with it. He brings an experience factor of making reads and sees the game at a high level. He has a high volleyball IQ, and he has developed into an explosive player.” 
With the uncertainty of Grasso for this game, the Trojans will look to maintain the intensity and competitiveness that won them their games earlier in the season. Nygaard’s focus is keeping his team’s energy high throughout the game, so that the Trojans can maintain control of the pace of the game.
“Of course, if we come in and expect to win, they are going to beat us,” said Nygaard. “If we come in prepared to battle, prepared to go head-to-head, prepared to first-whistle-last-whistle compete at a high level, I am happy with that. I think we will get the outcome we want.”

Christopher Chou | Daily TrojanThe doctor is in · Sean Nordt, assistant dean of pre-health studies, heads the only health care studies minor program in the United States.
Sumeet Sidhu, a senior majoring in health and humanity, has learned a lot about wilderness survival. He knows how to build a shelter by scavenging his surroundings and has studied the effects of hypothermia firsthand by jumping into 50 degree waters off of Catalina Island. 
But Sidhu is not a boy scout. He has taken MEDS 465: Wilderness and Survival Medicine, a course offered through Keck School of Medicine of USC’s health care studies minor program.
The health care studies minor is the first of its kind in the United States, as courses are taught by Keck faculty but at the undergraduate level. This provides undergraduate students interested in medicine with a direct link to a professional school, as well as access to teachers and mentors within the health sciences.
For Anna Catinis, a junior majoring in health and human sciences, the program has allowed her to access multiple volunteer and research opportunities.
“There’s this saying, ‘It’s not about the classes you take, it’s about the connections you make,’ and I think in a lot of cases that can be true,” Catinis said. “But this minor is a really wonderful exception in that the classes you take lead to the connections you make.” 
Through the minor, Catinis has been able to access Keck faculty and work alongside principal investigators when conducting research. She has also shadowed physicians in the Emergency Room of the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles alongside medical students, which she said provided her with a more realistic view of her career path.
“Shadowing the medical students is really relatable since they were in your shoes just a couple years before,” Catinis said. “You get to see what you’ll be doing in the next step, rather than 10 years down the road.”
Catinis currently conducts clinical research at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. The minor has also allowed Catinis to explore the medical field without taking classes she deemed unnecessary. 
“I ended up changing my major so that I could double-minor and fit in all my classes, and cut out some of those upper-division science classes like genetics and microcell biology,” Catinis said. “I have never regretted it — it’s probably one of the best decisions I’ve made at USC so far.” 
According to Sean Nordt, assistant dean of pre-health studies and the director of the minor in health care studies, the minor is open to students of all majors, and students are not required to declare the minor in order to take courses within the program.
“We’d love for anyone who wants to take the minor to do so, but we’re happy if someone just takes one course and dips their feet in it,” Nordt said. “The program is for anybody, not just for pre-med.” 
Caroline Vance, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, said the health care studies minor was crucial in allowing her to pursue a new career path without changing her major entirely. 
“I was contemplating a career switch midway through college, and I ended up using the minor to get more introduction to health care and clinical medicine,” Vance said. “It completely revolutionized my future and changed the way I see the world.”
For Sidhu, the program’s largest appeal was its access to Keck faculty and a wide range of course offerings, such as MEDS 425: Medical Examiner-Coroner: Investigating Death.
“It’s taught by the chief coroner of Los Angeles county, who testified at O.J. Simpson’s trial and led the autopsy on Michael Jackson,” Sidhu said. “He told us his office was really busy a couple weeks ago, and we were all pretty sure he was talking about Carrie Fisher.”
The minor provided Vance with research opportunities and real-world hospital experience that allowed her to bridge the gap between the content she learns in class and what she plans to do in the future. 
“It verifies that is what you want to do with your life,” she said. “You really get to see the light at the end of the tunnel — you’re working hard so that you can have these awesome clinical experiences, so it all seems worthwhile in the end.”

Mary Thompson-Jones, a former Foreign Service Officer in the U.S. Department of State, led a discussion on Wednesday at the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism on what the embassy cables published by WikiLeaks reveal about public diplomacy. 
According to Thompson-Jones, the 251,287 embassy cables that leaked in November 2010 revealed masses of secret information on under-the-table U.S. public diplomacy actions. This was the result of the efforts of WikiLeaks, a multi-national media organization founded in 2006. Classified cables were released to the public, revealing firsthand accounts of American diplomats. 
The WikiLeaks reveal allowed the public to see diplomacy from the perspective of embassy officers writing to Washington, D.C.
Perhaps the scariest result of the cable leaks, according to Thompson-Jones, was the realization that policymakers were frequently misjudging and distorting public diplomacy inquiries. She said the leak revealed conflicting approaches from Washington, D.C. stakeholders who held a vested interest in their own agenda and saw little of the battles occurring on the ground. The cables revealed the deepening gulf growing between the government and field agents, according to Thompson-Jones. 
She also explained that the ongoing foreign policy disconnect is rooted in poor long-distance communication. According to Thompson-Jones, officials in Washington, D.C. have been unwilling to listen to discourse outside Capitol Hill, which has caused a rift between politicians in Washington, D.C. and officers out in the field. 
Mietek Boduszynski, an assistant professor of politics and international relations at Pomona College as well as a former diplomat, gave further insight to America’s foreign policy disconnect and praised Thompson-Jones’ latest book on the issue. 
“I was looking for ways in my foreign policy class to explain to students what diplomats — especially American diplomats — do,” Boduszynski said. “The book will be a great resource and also raises great questions about communication in the diplomatic world.” 
Thompson-Jones said that with President Donald Trump’s administration, the discussion on transparency is even more relevant.
“I am really concerned about the future of public diplomacy in the Trump administration,” Thompson-Jones said. “Public diplomacy has to be founded on truth. This is crucial for foreign audiences and some of the misstatements, the disregarding of factual information, makes me concerned that we will lose credibility with foreign audiences.”
Thompson-Jones explained that the release of the cables by WikiLeaks had no intent to harm and there was no proof that anyone was threatened by the leaked information, though some officers did lose their jobs. Instead, she said, the real harm came to the foreign service itself. The downside of WikiLeaks was the initial brush-off by Washington, D.C. to what the cables had to say about foreign policy and the state of America’s relationships with other countries. According to Thompson-Jones, there is a heavy price to pay for not paying attention. 
Thompson-Jones highlighted the necessity of truth and communication between and among diplomats. Without truth in public diplomacy, the State Department would become impoverished, according to Thompson-Jones. It cannot lose its sense of curiosity for what happens in foreign parts, so America’s public diplomats must reconnect both in Washington, D.C. and the embassies, Thompson-Jones said. 
“If we don’t have truth, then public diplomacy cannot exist,” Thompson-Jones said. 
Maria Abou Atmi, a second year graduate student pursuing a master’s in public diplomacy, said she enjoyed having the chance to learn about a relevant topic from an expert in the field.
“It was great to hear from a former Foreign Service officer about the impact of WikiLeaks on public diplomacy and how important it is to have access to this information and how it affects the global-stage,” Atmi said.
