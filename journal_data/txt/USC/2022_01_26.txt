As Morgan Farrier watched the Jan. 13 launch of USC’s third satellite, Dodona, riding on SpaceX’s Transporter 3 mission, she saw her contributions since last spring become a reality. Farrier, a sophomore majoring in astronautical engineering, worked at the project’s Marina del Rey ground station in mission operations to create the satellite that would hitch a ride to orbit as part of SpaceX’s Smallsat Rideshare Program. 
Dodona is a project directed by research professor David Barnhart from the Space Engineering Research Center, a joint research center within the Viterbi School of Engineering Department of Astronautical Engineering and the Information Sciences Institute.
“Part of the mission of the SERC [is] to do advanced research in various space engineering disciplines, at different levels,” Barnhart said. “I refer to [SERC] as a space engineering teaching hospital because it’s intended to give students hands-on experience that they normally potentially wouldn’t get during their academic curriculum before they go out into industry or government to do it full-time.”
Partnered with the aerospace company Lockheed Martin, a group of undergraduate and graduate students working alongside employees at SERC undertook Dodona to integrate an internally built Cubesat mini satellite that was the size of a bread box — 10 centimeters long and wide, and 30 centimeters high — to test Lockheed Martin’s newest payload technologies in orbit. This technology is part of Lockheed Martin’s larger La Jument program, with Dodona being the first in a series of demonstration flights.
“Our job is to build a satellite for them, essentially, make sure that payload gets into space, points where it needs to point and then can bring its data back to the ground, and we can talk to it from the ground,” said Julia Schatz, a graduate student studying computer science and aerospace engineering who works at SERC.
The course of the year-long project was beset by multiple challenges. In addition to a myriad of technical difficulties and the students’ incomplete knowledge of satellite integrating, the coronavirus pandemic was the most serious of them, Barnhart said. Collaborators were prohibited from entering the laboratory as the time got closer to Jan. 13, the confirmed launch date. 
When Barnhart’s team obtained approval to return to the laboratory, there were protocols put in place for personal protective equipment, which brought new challenges to team members as only two of them could work, six feet apart, in the laboratory.
“The biggest hurdle that we had to face was because we’re working so close together; working apart six feet or making sure that there’s only two people in the lab was very difficult to actually just get progress, to actually get stuff done,” said Eugene Park, a masters student studying electrical and electronics engineering and engineering/industrial management. 
Under stringent coronavirus-related protocols, the project progressed at a much slower pace than expected, and the team’s timeline to test and integrate the satellite was also greatly compressed. It wasn’t until August, Park said, that the project “really started to pick up.”
“In the case of the satellite, there is a marker in the sand called the launch date,” Barnhart said. “You can’t miss the launch date.”
During the project, student researchers commuted nearly an hour to Marina del Rey, which required them to carefully balance their time when coping with different class schedules and other time commitments.
“Luckily, we had a strict rule of at most 16 hours a week, so even if people really want to volunteer, we want to make sure you get your minimum done, but also that school was a priority,” Park said. 
Plowing through multi-layered obstacles brought by the coronavirus pandemic, including accommodating student researchers of different class schedules into the lab and observing protocols against transmission, Barnhart said he utilized the project not only as a research program, but also as an educational opportunity for student researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the space engineering industry.
“The challenge, obviously, is to put in practices and techniques and procedures to minimize the potential risk and offer opportunities for [the student researchers] to learn as much as possible,” Barnhart said. “Because, again, most students haven’t done this before … It gives them a grounding and it also gives them confidence.”
The launch of the satellite did not mark the end of the project. Collaborators on Dodona continue to closely monitor the deployment of the satellite and communicate with it at the ground station. 
“Our next goal is to make sure that, once it detaches from that satellite, it actually does its job — it turns on properly, we’re able to communicate with it, take pictures [and] send messages back and forth,” Park said.

The Undergraduate Student Government discussed funding and current projects to increase accessibility and student wellness during the senate meeting Tuesday. 
To start off the meeting, chief financial officer Adenike Makinde introduced the spring innovation grant that will provide short-term programs opportunities to kickstart their projects that fit themes of student health, access to healthcare, career development, technology based pilot programs and large scale sustainability programs. The requested grants must be within $500 to $5000 and will roll out in the coming weeks. 
Makinde also announced the creation of additional funds, including the accessibility fund, which will help with accessibility trainings and increase program accessibility for students from registered student organizations, and the green engagement fund, which will help with events or programs that have a “focus on boosting awareness around sustainability.”
“We as an organization have been talking a lot more about accessibility, and the fact that there are entire buildings on this campus that are inaccessible to students … is a huge problem,” said president Alexis Areias in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
Later in the meeting, Areias shared the different projects she’s working on, including a free menstrual product pilot program that provides free menstrual products in seven different buildings on campus and hopefully will be available in every bathroom on campus.
“I think that it’s long overdue that we have universal access to free menstrual products,” Areias said. “California public schools have already implemented that change … and so far, pretty much everybody that we’ve talked to has been in support of that.” 
USG is also involved in the hiring process involving the replacement for former Chief of the Department of Public Safety John Thomas, who recently retired.
“We’re very grateful in USG to have representation and be a part of that search [for the replacement],” Areias said. “We’ve met with a number of consulting groups and recruiters to figure out who the best kind of third party would be to start searching and interviewing for that person.” 
During the meeting, senator Hunter Hinson raised questions about USG’s reaction to the Working Group on Interfraternity Council Culture, Prevention, and Accountability’s recommendations about sexual assault reports at USC fraternities. USG nominated a member of their cabinet to serve in this task force and worked closely with the Student Coalition Against Sexual Violence. 
“I would be lying if I said I was completely satisfied with what has come out,” Areias said. “I think a lot of the recommendations that were released were done without a lot of [the student’s] input … so I don’t think I can confidently say that I am in full support, but I think it’s a great start.”
Senator Diego Andrades also spoke about his project that he’s working on with Areias and vice president Lucy Warren to stock wellness vending machines with take home STI testing kits. Currently, they are in the research phase, looking at how other universities are offering these services.
Andrades also shared that USC will host the 2028 Olympics, which Andrades said will magnify a lot of problems in the city of Los Angeles, including gentrification, overpolicing and police militarization. 
“I’ve been working with the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, and I will have a resolution pending just to disclose the relationship that USC does have with the Olympics,” Andrades said. “I’m really trying to emphasize transparency between the relationship that USC has with the Olympics … and ensuring that, since SCALE is the primary author voice … [it reflects] the entire sentiment of the student body as presented by SCALE.”
During the discussion section of the meeting, Maddy Hood, executive director of the Military Associated Student Association, spoke about the organization with the goal of reaching assembly status.
“There really is a need for this kind of community in a way that’s kind of easy to miss,” said Hood in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We really want to make sure that we’re not only bringing engagement for our community in and of itself, but serving the purpose of connecting the broader student government and being a link between the military associated students and USC as a whole.”

If we’ve seen anything through the coronavirus pandemic, it’s that the hundreds of artists attending USC will stop at nothing to pursue their work. Still, due to the uncertainty around live events and in the interest of safety, students have experienced limited opportunities to showcase their talents.
For example, a number of senior showcases — an invaluable experience for graduating Roski School of Art and Design students — were delayed this January after the omicron surge led to a remote start. Margot Ryan, a senior majoring in fine art, had her expectations dashed by the sudden change.
“I’ve been wary that things could happen and people might not be able to see my work, which has been very stressful,” Ryan said. “But the point of [my art] is to be viewed and experienced by people, and you just can’t get that online.”
The reception of Ryan’s exhibition in Helen Lindhurst Gallery at Watt Hall, titled “PAUSE,” was originally scheduled for Jan. 12 but was delayed until the end of its stay, Jan. 26, due to coronavirus precautions. The uneasy installation process caused her to reflect on her work, worrying if her exhibit would ever be seen by students in person.
“I’ve had way more time to install [now that] people haven’t been around because of online classes,” Ryan said. “But it’s also been really stressful. I’m worried [that] it can be taken away so quickly, [that] nothing is for certain … It’s definitely a roller coaster.”
Despite the delay and the daunting unease that the pandemic has cast over the professional arts landscape, Ryan remained determined to showcase her work. She fell in love with painting in high school but didn’t expect to leave her hometown of New York for school, much less to study the arts. She credits her older sister, who graduated from USC in 2017, for encouraging her to pursue fine art.
“She studied at Roski, had a show and really paved the way for me to go,” Ryan said. “I feel like if she didn’t, I never would have had the idea that I could pursue art or move across the country.”
Heading to Hollywood couldn’t have been a better fit for her work. Ryan draws inspiration from the style and techniques of cinema, capturing realistic images and implying movement in her paintings as if they were a frame from a film reel. Since taking up a minor in cinematic arts, she’s begun to approach her canvases as more of a scenery designer, rather than a painter.
“‘Similar to art direction or production design for the frame of a movie, I’m doing the same thing with a painting,” she said. “It’s like production, almost setting everything up … It’s very similar [to] the process of staging the photo.”
Her collection of work currently on display explores this approach, merging together video clips and Ryan’s artistic interpretation of their frames. She added a projector to cast the videos which contrast her paintings, and QR codes connected to her website that play the video that inspired each painting.
“I was [wondering] how I could connect in people’s minds that [the video] is my inspiration; this is what I’m drawing from. I feel like that detail really helped bring it all together,” she said. 
Ryan’s extended installation time let her focus not just on her multimedia elements but also on small details to evoke a feeling of nostalgia in her audience. For Ryan, the key is her tender connection to the movies — she included a red carpet to decorate the gallery and is serving popcorn at the coming reception.
“I tried to bring up a lot of nostalgia and familiarity,” Ryan said. “Most of my work has [depicted a person] interacting with nature … When the viewer sees it, they recall ‘Oh, I remember when I saw sunset on the beach,’ and they remember the feelings they felt and the memory.”
Though a great deal of students missed most of the exhibition, the reception — its most important night — is still ahead. Students can see Ryan’s work at Watt Hall for its final viewing Jan. 26 starting at 9 a.m. until the reception at 5 to 7 p.m.

It can be daunting to go out with a seemingly endless stream of new coronavirus variants and the ever-present threat of getting sick. For many, going out means putting yourself in danger, but staying home can be tedious. 
Luckily, Los Angeles, although enormous and confusing, has plenty of exciting outdoor activities that will make you forget about the severity of the pandemic and your stress of life for just a little bit. 
Gardens galore
The sun’s out and the weather is getting warmer, so get dressed up and head over to Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino for a relaxing stroll through nature. Huntington has many interesting green spots. 
The Camellia Garden is where you should spend your time during a January visit. The garden holds over 80 camellia species, and most of them are at their blooming peak in January and February. So, whether or not you are into flowers (although really, who isn’t?), the garden will take your breath away. While you are there, walk through the relaxing bonsai collection and fantasize about a life with no exams and no stress, where you can grow plants all day without a care in the world.  
If Huntington is not for you — maybe it’s a little too far or you’re just not in the mood — head the opposite direction into Malibu and spend the day walking around the Getty Villa Museum. Although the Getty Villa is a museum first and a garden second (the opposite of the Huntington), it is still a worthwhile trip. Spend a few hours pretending you are in your Roman villa, critiquing art and taking in the Malibu views. 
Biking on the Beach
Whether you are a pro-mountain biker or an amateur who is just a little scared of biking, the Santa Monica bike path is easy, relatively flat and gives you incredible views of the ocean. If you do not have a bike or don’t feel like lugging yours to the beach, there are several spots to rent a bike around the pier, like Santa Monica Bike Rentals ($30 per day) and Perry’s Bikes & Beach Rentals ($10 per hour), making a beach biking day an option for everyone.
Start in Santa Monica and head up the coast toward Will Rogers State Beach to get a crowd-free, ocean-scented ride. When you have had your fill of biking and are in the mood to stop, pull over at a Perry’s Beach Cafe, located at multiple places along the bike path in Santa Monica, for a cooldown smoothie. Their piña colada smoothies will make you forget you are less than one month into a long semester. 
Hit up a night market
One of the best parts of L.A. is its delicious food. There are tons of unique food communities, and one could eat their way around the city and never run out of food. A spot that is a must-add to your list and worth putting your other food spots on the backburner for is the Avenue 26 Night Market. 
After going viral on TikTok last August, Avenue 26 Night Market exploded, and for good reason. Avenue 26 is a delicious hub of life-changing food and fun. If you are going during the day, stop at Martinez Ice Cream for sweet, flavorful cold treats. If you are heading over at night, stop at Tacos El Champ for your first of many dinner stops and Churros El Bochito for dessert.
Dinner and sunset with a view 
Feeling up for an adventure, but you don’t want to leave the city? Head up to Griffith Observatory for one of the best sunset views in L.A. Make sure to get there early because the good spots fill up quickly. Although you might have to fight through anxious onlookers desperate to soak in all that Griffith has to offer, the fight is worth it. From the top of Griffith Observatory, you can see the entire city. 
Stop by Trader Joe’s for some delicious and easily transportable dinner options, like its Pasadena Salad, and then head out for the night. With sunset occurring around 5:30 p.m., make sure to leave early to beat awful L.A. traffic. 
Stargazing 
In the mood to get out of L.A. for the evening? Head north to Angeles National Forest and drive up to Mount Wilson Observatory. Although it can be a trek to get up into the mountains, getting away from the city means significantly less light pollution and a chance to see the stars. 
Make sure to pack or pick up dinner before you head up the mountain and plan on staying to explore the area. Angeles National Forest is beautiful, and there are incredible views of both the sunset and the stars. Getting away from the city’s smog and noisy highways is an unmatched bonus to this excursion.
After you are done looking at the stars, head down the mountain and think about what you just saw over a life-changing ice cream scoop at Moo Moo Mia in Montrose or Salt & Straw in Pasadena.

I’ve been enthralled by science fictionist Ray Bradbury’s short story, “The Last Night of the World,” ever since high school. Everyone in the world has the same dream — that the next day would be the last — and is essentially at peace with it. While there’s no real explanation for the apocalypse, the characters simply enjoy their last night of existence, going about their nightly routine before going to sleep. It’s such a casual acceptance of their own mortality, and consequently, sets the stage for generations of apocalyptic rhetoric to come.
I’m no film critic, but I would be remiss if I didn’t address the controversial new movie, “Don’t Look Up.” I’ve refrained from watching because my Twitter feed has been clogged with polarizing hot takes on the film, but I love nothing more than assigning an academic purpose to binging Netflix, so I sat down this weekend to watch the film that critics call “mean-spirited and smug.”  
For those of you who haven’t yet set aside the 2.5 hours of attention span, “Don’t Look Up” follows a pair of astronomers who discover a comet with the trajectory to end life on Earth. As the news takes off, doctoral student Kate and her adviser Randall Mindy are forced to deal with the unpredictability of the media, the politically and financially motivated moves of the United States government, and eventually, the end of the world as we know it.  
At first glance, “Don’t Look Up” is “Saturday Night Live”-esque satire at its best — somewhat uncomfortable, overtly obvious and extremely clever. But as plainly sardonic as the movie is, it’s hard to ignore the countless parallels to the way that our nation is dealing with climate change. From the crowds filled with familiar red baseball caps at the “Don’t Look Up” rallies to vapid social media trends precursing the rapidly approaching comet, the blatant denial of the gravity of the situation leads to the decisive demise of civilization.
Political satire is no new mechanism for digesting difficult topics, yet the utter absurdity of the reactions to the apocalyptic comet soaring through the atmosphere is scarily similar to the divisiveness of the issue of climate change. As exaggeratedly reiterative as the movie is, the constant politicization of science continues to misconstrue media misconceptions. When faced with constant doubters, Randall continues to repeat the irrefutable fact that he has the data to prove that the comet is headed their way. 
“Don’t Look Up” received criticism about it being unsubtle — yet this is precisely the message it’s trying to send. From tech billionaire Peter Isherwell presenting his latest technology, adding in his unnerving falsetto that “We can make sure … sad feelings never, ever return,” to the hosts of the recurring talk show reminding Randall to “keep the bad news light,” “Don’t Look Up” speaks volumes about the way that the messaging of climate change tends to fall on unreceptive ears. It begs the question that climate journalists (myself included) are constantly asking themselves — how can we get people to care about something that will inevitably affect them when they don’t want to believe it exists at all?
“Don’t Look Up” points fingers at the media, no doubt, but the blanket of criticism covers all — the government, political party polarization, the media, the public and even the three scientists the movie centers on. Choosing climate activist and yacht enthusiast Leonardo DiCaprio for the lead role is questionable, but he plays the part of the befuddled academic thrown into the limelight perfectly. Even Randall has his moment of corruption when he becomes an astronomical sex symbol and engages in an affair, going so far as to endorse the White House’s Isherwell-backed campaign that the comet will create new jobs. 
However, despite their best efforts to communicate the urgency of the situation, the characters accept defeat. Drawing an uncanny parallel to the final scene of Bradbury’s tale, the movie closes with a final family dinner at the Mindy household, along with Kate and her new fiancée, Yule, an evangelical Christian with unmistakably chiseled cheekbones. The group continue to chat around the table about the merits of store-bought apple pie versus the homemade variety as the lights flicker, the glasses on the table shake, and the comet and its debris rain down on the world.
Forget my biweekly allowance of 900 words, I wish I could conduct an entire scientific study on this movie. “Don’t Look Up” provides a breath of semi-fresh air to the constant scroll of doom-and-gloom climate headlines. It balances, as The Atlantic describes it, advocacy and nihilism while honing in on the way climate change is perceived and dealt with due to competing priorities. 
Like Randall and Kate, climate experts will stop at nothing to communicate the criticality of the situation at hand, but unlike the characters in the movie, our fate isn’t sealed. Even if you were disappointed with the messy ending of “Don’t Look Up,” it provided a much needed call to reflect upon our personal and collective priorities, as well as the media and how we consume it. Let’s be honest — when it comes to the current climate of climate change, things aren’t great. But we still have the power to decide how our story ends.

Contemporary elitism taints the walls of McCarthy Honors Residential College, setting USC students on an unsatisfying journey to an incomplete purpose and dividing them from one another on a scale of intellect and, in some cases, worth. An honors college, at any institution, serves as a tangible reward. 
Ultimately, this hinders the success and promise of every student at that institution, as an honors residential college creates a space that sets students apart from their peers on a scale of superiority before their potential at the University level has even touched the brim. 
Now, this does not mean that students who earn acceptance to McCarthy are to blame. Unfortunately, the elitism plaguing USC is embedded in the system. 
Take, for example, entrance to USC in the first place. Extraordinary privilege — affluent parents, SAT tutoring, private schools and academically advanced endeavors — allows students to meet the threshold of achievement required for admission in many cases. Although these privileges are not limited to USC, many Trojans have embraced their advantages to another level. This was evident at the tailgates for the USC versus UCLA football game, with houses plastered with posters reading “You can’t afford us” and “Your dad works for my dad.” 
While school pride is a virtue to have at USC, the line between pride and arrogance is often crossed at the University. Daily Trojan writer Annie Bang who covered the elitist behavior at the tailgates said, “Allowing these statements to exist without backlash establishes a toxic, pervasive culture of shallow values, placing significance on socioeconomic status and discriminating based on financial footings.”
With the nickname “University of Spoiled Children,” is USC truly following their core values of supporting, educating and engaging students to “transform the world?”
At USC, elitism is embedded in casual conversation. I remember sitting with my friends and watching people search for each other’s high school tuitions to compare the amount of money they had to pay over the four years. Although some people were visibly uncomfortable, for others, these comparisons were normal. 
USC also offers another program to its undergraduate freshmen: the Freshman Science Honors Program. It asks students for their AP test scores and research experiences. My high school never required its students to take the AP exams, and as a student who went to three different schools within my four years of high school, I had no period of continuity to dedicate to research. Nonetheless, I carefully curated my essays for the application and hoped for the best. 
I was soon rejected and put on the waitlist for the program. However, during the break, they emailed me back, asking if I would like to join the program since I earned an A in my biology and chemistry classes during my first semester. I was shocked. How is it that all it took for this honors program to accept me was a tangible letter grade? I didn’t have to write any essays explaining my passion for STEM or life story. No, all it took was proving my academic capabilities. 
I didn’t take the offer, not because I wouldn’t love to be in an honors program, but because I knew that entrance to the program was solely dependent on grades, rather than a true passion for science or my ability to eloquently portray that in an essay. 
Why is it that all these privileges exist? Complacency. 
Privilege is comfortable. When you have the upper hand, why change it? Why admit to a problem when your life is comfortable without it? However, USC must change. If elitism at higher-level institutions is not dealt with, not spoken about or if students, faculty and staff are not supported in their complaints, incentives for working-class entry into the world of academia will inevitably decrease. 
Society chases a tangible trophy to accompany its goal. Regardless of how far one may get in their journey to success, there will always be an extra “and” or another thing one can do. For USC students, this can be anything from living in McCarthy to enrolling in FSH to having a high number of LinkedIn connections. And to be clear, nobody’s to blame – not even USC for creating McCarthy or FSH. In fact, these programs are simply a reflection of us all. 
Far more important than these programs, however, is elitism – the idea that individuals ranked based on a set of skills, often intelligence or wealth, contribute more to society than others – itself. 
USC simply made life easier for their student populations and carved out this elite group from their college applications. When the four years of college are over, perhaps some will continue on this pursuit. However, more often than not, the attempt to divide students on this basis will undoubtedly allow elitism to continue to run rampant in our society.

This weekend marks the start of the 2022 season for women’s water polo with two home games against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Occidental. 
The Trojans hope to pick off right where they left off from last season. Coming off their seventh NCAA championship in the school’s history, the Trojans are ranked No. 1 in the preseason poll. Although the opponents this weekend aren’t ranked in the preseason poll, the Trojans will aim to show no signs of a slow start. 
With many seniors graduating from the roster, USC will look for new difference makers on the team this year. After losing redshirt senior and longtime starting goalie Holly Parker, there will be a new face in goal for the Trojans this season. Junior goalie Carolyne Stern currently has the most game experience of anyone in the goalie room. Stern averages about 6.4 saves in nine career appearances, including making an appearance in the second half of the quarterfinal against Marist and recording four saves. The only other goalie with prior playing experience at USC is redshirt junior Erin Tharp, who has played in seven games during her time at USC.
As far as the offensive end, senior utility Bayley Weber comes off a season in which she made the All-America Second Team as well as earning an All-MPSF honorable mention. Weber also made her presence known when it mattered most, scoring a hat trick in the NCAA Final last season. Driver Grace Tehaney also returns for her senior season, coming off her junior season in which she scored 34 goals in 19 different games and an All-American Honorable Mention.
Another big part for USC this season could be the return of redshirt sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns, who sat out last season to train with the Australian national team and help them finish fifth at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Kearns made a mark in her first season as a Trojan, scoring 29 goals as a true freshman including a 5-goal game against Fresno State. She is now two years removed from her freshman season, returning with a breadth of experience at the international level. Kearns will likely be a focal point for USC throughout the season and will look to get early action in the games this weekend.
Returning for his third season as the head coach, Marko Pintaric will look to repeat the success he had with the team last year. With a roster that includes 16 underclassmen, Pintaric will have a lot of new faces to work with as the season gets under way.
USC has two games at Uytengsu Aquatics Center Saturday, Jan. 29 — the first at 2 p.m. against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and the second against Occidental at 3:15 p.m.

Coming off of a weekend split with two Big Ten powerhouses at the Pac 12/Big Ten Challenge in Westwood, No. 10 USC men’s volleyball returns home to Galen Center Wednesday night, where they will host UC Irvine.
Sitting at 5-1 on the season, the Trojans are off to their best start under Head Coach Jeff Nygaard, who has led the program since 2015. USC upset then-No. 3 Penn State Friday night in Westwood, before falling to then-No. 11 Ohio State Saturday.
Leading the way in the Trojans’ hot start has been redshirt sophomore opposite hitter/outside hitter Simon Gallas. Gallas currently leads the team with 92 kills on the season. In addition, he is tied for the team lead with 8 service aces.
Redshirt senior captain setter Chris Hall is currently in his fifth year as a starter. Like many others, Hall took advantage of an NCAA rule that granted an additional year of eligibility to all student athletes due to the coronavirus pandemic. Hall already has 236 assists on the season through just six games.
“The culture we’ve been building for a while is starting to show,” Hall said. “I think [our] experience is a huge thing, and I’m very comfortable with a lot of the people on the team, just from years of practice with them.” 
In addition to its offense, stout defense has played a key role in USC’s start to the season. The Trojans currently have four players with double-digit blocks on the season, including senior middle blocker Liam Schroeder, who leads the team with 20. USC’s defensive effort is also led by fellow seniors outside hitter Brandon Browning and libero Cole Paxson — a co-captain alongside Hall — who have 45 and 40 digs on the year, respectively.
While USC enters the match hot, UC Irvine’s start has been inconsistent, having been swept by then-No. 10 BYU in Provo, Utah over the weekend. The week prior, the Anteaters knocked off then-No. 12 Stanford in Irvine. UC Irvine currently sits at 3-3 on the season.
The Trojans must be wary of sophomore outside hitter Francesco Sani, who currently leads the Anteaters with 94 kills.
In order for USC to get its offensive attack going, it must find a way to get the ball past sophomore middle blocker Connor Campbell. Standing at 6-foot-7, Campbell has 34 blocks through the first six games of the season, nearly double that of the player with the second-most on the team.
“We definitely can’t underestimate them,” Hall said. “We’ve got to take them like they’re one of the best teams in the country, and we have to try to show respect by giving it our all.” 
Wednesday night’s match will mark the first USC men’s volleyball home game in front of fans since 2020.
“I love feeding off the energy of the crowd,” said Hall when asked about the return of fans. “Especially at a home game, it makes a big difference.” 
The Trojans and the Anteaters will square off at Galen Center on Wednesday night at 7 p.m.
