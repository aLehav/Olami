With five minutes and 34 seconds left in the third period, No. 3 USC surrendered a fifth-straight goal to No. 4 Stanford making the score 9-5 when Head Coach Marko Pintaric called a timeout. The Trojans, who were looking for their first Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference win of the season, had to come from behind to secure it. 
After that timeout, USC came out with a brand new energy completely flipping the momentum of the game. The Trojans would proceed to go on a dominant 10-2 run to close out No. 4 Stanford by a score of 15-11 on the road and get their 14th win of the season. 
“That whole unit was out of sync giving up nine goals to that point and the timeout was necessary, just really to calm them down and address the defense issues we had,” Pintaric said. “Kind of giving them a little guidance to remind them how to beat Stanford … it was a great timeout because they did find their rhythm and went on a great run.”
Before the timeout nothing was going in USC’s favor, until leading scorer redshirt senior driver Jacob Mercep blasted in a shot to get the Trojans in the right direction after Pintaric’s timeout. Mercep finished the day with two goals and four assists, three of such assists being to fellow senior Jake Ehrhardt. 
Those two goals now moves Mercep into a tie with Robert Lynn for fourth-most career goals in USC history.
Mercep wasn’t the only one who helped the Trojans turn the tide, as both senior 2-meter Ehrhardt and junior driver Marcus Longton both had hat-tricks on the day. This is now the eight-straight game Ehrhardt has had at least one goal, and the seventh-straight such game for redshirt junior driver Ashworth Molthen. It was a collective effort for the Trojans as, once again, nine players had at least one goal in the victory over Stanford. 
Senior goalie Nic Porter was a major factor in the USC victory as he and the defense were able to hold Stanford scoreless in the fourth period. Porter finished the contest with 15 saves  as he stonewalled the Cardinal every opportunity they had in the fourth period. 
Those 15 saves moved Porter into 7th place for most USC career saves, only ten saves off of sixth place.
Pintaric had a few takeaways from the comeback win to help build off of in the next few weeks.
“The team is still learning how to play with each other,” Pintaric said. “And it’s a process so that’s my number one thing because it’s evident that these guys can turn things around and play great.”
The Trojans have now won two-straight against the Cardinal, the other being earlier this season in the MPSF invitational tournament. Now with its first conference win of the season, USC is poised to finish the regular season strong having only two games remaining against the University of California, Santa Barbara and No. 1 UCLA.
Pintaric was very pleased with the result of the game and the resilience the team showed when things were looking bleak.
“I’m very pleased and proud of the guys … the last ten minutes of the game, great, and the guys played with great desire and refused to lose,” Pintaric said.
Next week the Trojans host No. 7 Santa Barbara at Uytengsu Aquatic Center Sunday at 1 p.m.

Save time, save money, stay healthy. Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anyone else — Amazon Pharmacy is about the future.
Because of the coronavirus, telehealth demand has skyrocketed and Amazon’s timely entry into the pharmaceutical industry has the potential to take the world by storm. Locally, Amazon Pharmacy can especially benefit college students. 
Although medications require a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider, Amazon Pharmacy customers do not need insurance to purchase medication. This policy is especially beneficial for college students going through a transition period to become independent from their families and looking to purchase their own health insurance. After all, it is common for insurance companies to make it difficult for students to seek medical care. 
In light of the mental health crises that many college students may face, Amazon Pharmacy is capable of meeting these demands for mental health services and medicinal needs. 
At Plushcare, a nationwide virtual platform that connects patients to health care professionals for same-day appointments, patients can speak to a doctor about their medical needs and then pick up their prescription at a local CVS or Walmart. With its vigorous foray into the trillion-dollar healthcare and insurance industries, Amazon can combine all of these services into a compact, one-stop shop. 
Amazon Pharmacy threatens major players in the pharmaceutical industry, and it has powerful advantages that deem it superior: Convenience of setup and ability to track orders. Signing up for Amazon Pharmacy takes only about five minutes, and customers can easily track their prescriptions like their other purchases from Amazon; the latter is unique to Amazon because no other retail pharmacies currently offer prescription tracking comparable to Amazon’s accuracy. 
The prevalence of Amazon pick-up lockers in college locations cater to a college students busy lifestyle, therefore increasing accessibility for college students to get their prescriptions. In the future, Amazon can either partner with other pharmacies or open their own in-person retail pharmacy near college campuses.
With over 150 million Amazon prime members in the United States, Amazon Pharmacy offers two major benefits for prime members: Free two-day shipping for medications and discounts of up to 80% and up to 40% for generic and brand-name drugs, respectively. Through medication discounts, Amazon Pharmacy members can buy their own drugs for a cheaper price than if they were to use their insurance benefits. 
While Amazon Pharmacy is still in its novel stage, it should join forces with Accessible Pharmacy to become a global force within the healthcare sphere for people with intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities. Accessible Pharmacy emphasizes reduction of barriers for people with disabilities by providing packaging and a labeling menu for prescriptions that includes Braille, large print and audio among other services geared toward accessibility. Amazon Pharmacy should learn from them and incorporate greater levels of accessibility into its mission.
Bringing Amazon’s customer obsession to Big Pharma can ultimately change drug consumerism for the better; seamless digital pharmacy transactions will dominate the brick-and-mortar pharmacy.
Jeff Bezos, Founder and Executive Chairman at Amazon, does not fear failure. His aggressive pharmacy strategy eliminates the middle parties in Big Pharma; while a drug usually has to pass through at least three parties to make it from the drug-maker to the patient, Amazon Pharmacy streamlines the entire process to make it easier for drug-makers, insurance companies and the patient, while taking affordability into account. 
Despite Big Pharma’s impending downfall due to its highly convoluted and overly complex business models, Amazon Pharmacy’s success is well-deserved if it focuses on affordability along with the efficiency that it already provides. Amazon needs to use its power and corporate strategy to compensate for the necessarily high prescription prices that plague Big Pharma.
Health is so important. In an era of online shopping, Amazon is one of the best e-commerce platforms. However, it will take time and effort for the tech giant to rise to the top over Big Pharma. For USC students, we might just see an Amazon Pharmacy open up near Amazon at the Village in the coming years — the pharmacy of the future.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault, drugging and violence.
The Undergraduate Student Government discussed their demands following the Sigma Nu sexual assault incidents and plans to improve the Office of Student Accessibility Services in the senate meeting Tuesday. 
Vice president Lucy Warren and chief of staff Max Gomez presented an initial list of demands for USC following multiple days of protests after seven reported instances of sexual assault and drugging at the Sigma Nu Fraternity house.
Demands included removing the members and Interfraternity Council chapters involved in incidents of sexual assault and drugging, implementing reforms and University oversight for Greek life spaces, providing drug testing strips to students and overhauling the systems available for students to report sexual assaults and crimes. 
“It’s very heartening to see students turning out to support survivors in this moment, and USG has been trying to coordinate a response with a lot of different partners on campus and student organizations and advocacy groups,” Gomez said. 
Overhauls to student reporting would involve creating a centralized form available through student organizations and University platforms, Warren said.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Warren said one of the elements of the reform is to assign mandated reporters within student organizations.
“There are campus leaders who are not paid workers, such as [resident assistants], that are mandated reporters, and they go through the proper training on what [the] mechanisms are to report and how to teach other students to utilize those,” Warren said. “We would love to see that happen even on the executive boards of IFC, [the Panhellenic Council], other Greek organizations.”
According to Warren, the testing strip program, in collaboration with Trojan Awareness Combating Overdose, would also mandate tests that can detect roofies at registered social events and provide training on utilizing them.
“Ideally, we would partner with TACO to make their training program as accessible as possible to students,” Warren said. “We’re hoping to bring awareness to their training across campus as well.”
Speaker of the senate Ruben Romeo next presented a project to improve OSAS through additional resources and expanded student literacy of the services available.  
The advocacy project calls for the University to increase funding and support for the office, said Romeo in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
“I noticed with the OSAS office that they seem to be particularly under budgeted and understaffed,” Romeo said. “I think OSAS is spread sparsely thin.” 
The project also seeks to raise awareness of the office’s services, particularly by embedding relevant information in freshman orientation programs. 
“I don’t think even students know that you can go to OSAS for mental health conditions as well,” Romeo said. “Students I’ve heard around me have gone through their semester just pushing through their mental health, when they’re actively seeing clinicians, for example, with real conditions that they could get accommodated for.”
During the meeting’s brief discussion period, senator Hunter Hinson detailed a report that revealed nearly one in three women undergraduates said they were assaulted on campus, a number which has doubled since the report’s initial survey in 2015. According to data gathered by the Association of American Universities in 2019, USC’s reported numbers are higher than the national average.  
“That’s very shocking considering 2015 was the last time that there were a lot of big calls for reform to Greek life due to issues with sexual assault,” Hinson said. “I recommend people to read more from that report regarding that situation.” 
The Undergraduate Student Government will release full details of its demands in an email Wednesday.

As the flu season approaches, USC Student Health seeks higher vaccination rates in the community and plans to continue its push for flu and coronavirus booster vaccinations, said Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman in a student health briefing Tuesday.
As of Tuesday, 35% of undergraduate students, 60% of staff and faculty and 45% of graduate students are vaccinated against the flu. However, Van Orman said it is likely that more students are currently vaccinated against the flu but have yet to upload their documentation.
“The deadline is fast approaching. We can expect to see the flu as early as Dec. 1, so we really want people to start planning their flu shots,” Van Orman said.
USC Student Health plans to send additional messages to those who have not received their flu vaccinations, Van Orman said. The deadline to receive the flu vaccination is Nov. 1. 
Student Health hopes to reach a vaccination rate greater than 95% in the student community before the flu season begins in mid-December, Van Orman said, especially considering the two weeks after vaccination it takes to develop antibodies for the flu. 
As the coronavirus continues circulating, students risk severe illness if they contract either the coronavirus or the flu, in addition to missing academic time, Van Orman said. Of the tests administered last week, 39 students and 2 employees tested positive for the coronavirus, yielding positivity rates of 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.  
“If students get the flu, that means they’re going to be out, potentially missing class, because they have to stay home,” Van Orman said. “There’s some studies from the University of Minnesota from a few years ago that say that the average student misses five to seven days of school just because of how serious an illness it is.”
Aside from decreasing the risk of coronavirus contraction and missing classes, receiving the flu vaccine can protect the community from flu spread in the winter and from individuals experiencing serious symptoms, Van Orman said.
Students may also file a religious and medical exemption for the flu shot, which students can access on their MySHR portal.
The University is currently providing booster shots for the coronavirus through pharmacy appointments at the Lyon Center for both Moderna and Pfizer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends booster shots six months following full vaccination and for those with high-risk conditions or work environments. For those who received Johnson & Johnson, CDC officials also recommend a booster shot 2 months after full vaccination.
USC will contact applicable students in the next week, Van Orman said.
“​​Most people who got Johnson & Johnson actually need a booster right now, and they can get that either by getting another Johnson & Johnson, or they can mix and match for their booster,” Van Orman said. ”We’re going to be directly messaging anyone who got Johnson & Johnson in the next week, encouraging them to come in to get a booster shot.”
Van Orman encourages all students to receive a booster shot once the vaccine opens for their age group, even those who are not in immediate at risk groups because the shots can reduce the rate of breakthrough infections. Reduced levels of breakthrough infections lead to decreased spreading, stress and hospitalization, Van Orman said.
“What we’re seeing is, after about six to eight months, we’re seeing increases in the number of people that were having declining antibody levels with both of those vaccines, as well as more breakthrough infections,” Van Orman said. 
Beyond vaccinations, Van Orman also shared resources available from the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services.  
RSVP, an organization comprised of advocates available 24/7 for students who have experienced any form of sexual violence, provides immediate therapy services for situations including gender and power-based harm. 
According to their website, all RSVP services are confidential and provide resources and accompaniment to specialty centers if forensic exams or rape kits are needed. Students can also access counseling and mental health services using Trojans Care 4 Trojans and the mySHR portal.

For some reason, I’m in a nostalgic patch.
Maybe it’s because my graduation is on the horizon, and now that we are back on campus, everything seems to remind me of my freshman year. Or maybe it’s because I bought a bunch of old games, and I’m currently dedicating all my free time to beating them (Super Monkey Ball 2 is harder than it sounds, I swear). 
Who knows? 
Regardless, I found myself looking over my old columns. Now that a year has passed since my first column, I’m finally able to read them with a fresh pair of eyes. And I have to say: Some of them really don’t hold up.
Sure, my early writing was shoddy when compared to my current articles. But my criticism is mostly centered around myactual analysis. 
Some of my predictions were completely off, and a variety of my suggestions showed how green behind the ears I was to this entire field. Granted, making mistakes is part of the job, regardless of how many years you have under your belt. That still won’t stop me from cringing whenever I read some of my early conclusions, though. 
After painstakingly going through all my articles and cursing my obvious youthful hubris, I was forced to admit I still have a long way until I can become a proper esports commentator.
However, that did get me thinking: What does make a good esports commentator?
Initially, I thought that the core tenants would be the same as just regular sportscasters: Funny and knowledgeable on whatever they’re covering (or at least enough to make plausible predictions). And I was right!
Well, sort of. I also realized that esports commentators, especially those that cast over live matches, need to have one more quality: Being able to explain the game to the audience. 
This is virtually unseen in any other field. After all, no serious sportscaster ever stopped their commentary to explain how to play football or basketball, right? 
But in esports, it’s easy to get disoriented during matches without some explanation on how the game works, especially if the game in question has dozens of characters and mechanics such as League of Legends. 
Of course, the amount of explaining is deeply connected to the event’s target audience; more casual viewers will require more “hand-holding” than those who actively participate in the competitive scene. But even this difference goes to show that, more so than in most other sports, esports commentators genuinely serve as a bridge between the viewers and the athletes.
As soon as I realized this, my respect for the field skyrocketed, and I was ready to make up a plan on how the esports scene can properly value its sportscasters.
The problem, however, is that it generally already does.
Take for example EVO, one of the most prestigious fighting game competitions in the world. Unlike other tournaments, it hosts a plethora of games, with its roster changing every year. This means that fans who decide to attend the event will likely only be there for a specific game but will still be exposed to a handful of others to which they know nothing of. 
What this translates into is an audience that is at both times casual and professional. So how does EVO solve this problem? 
Easy: Hire a bunch of commentators that specialize in different audiences only after they decide on which games to feature.
Not only does this solve the problem of having a permanent caster who does not understand the game, but also allows fans of all different backgrounds to properly enjoy what they are seeing. After all, regardless of your culture, gender, and even knowledge of the game itself, there is likely a commentator that can make you feel like a part of the action. 
Of course, organizers still have to work out pairings and time slots and whatnot, but by having a wide variety of commentators to pick from, they at least minimize the chance of alienating their audience. 
Other tournaments that feature only one game also show that they understand the importance of commentary. Take for example the recent Valorant tournament held in Berlin. 
Not only did they have special castings for different zones across the world (North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia), they also partnered with a handful of Twitch streamers and gave them permission to restream the event. This means that anyone who is even remotely interested in Valorant, regardless of their cultural background or favorite type of casting, can interact with the event. 
While there are many other tournaments using their casters wisely, the two that I highlighted serve to illustrate the uniqueness of esports commentary. It can, more than any other sport, meet the audience wherever it may be. 
And perhaps, thanks to that very flexibility, it achieves perfect harmony with what made gaming interesting in the first place: The fact that anyone, regardless of their background, can play a video game and enjoy it.

After an 11-12 record in the 2020-2021 season and an 8-10 record in Pac-12 play, the women’s basketball team has a lot to improve in their offseason. Last season, USC missed out on the NCAA tournament. The team will need a strong conference play record to convince the selection committee to send a tournament invitation to the Trojans. 
With the complete 2021-2022 season schedule announced on Oct. 11, here are the five most important Pac-12 games on the Trojans’ schedule.
Dec. 28 at No. 20 UCLA
The Trojans kick off Pac-12 play with a marquee matchup against their cross-town rivals. It’s a game that could give either USC momentum for a successful season or put the Trojans on the wrong path. 
Last year, the Trojans lost the last two games against the Bruins by a combined 63 points, but USC may have a chance against UCLA with the loss of forward Michaela Onyenwere to the New York Liberty during the WNBA draft. Onyenwere scored 49 total points against USC last season, so UCLA will need another player to step up in her absence.
Jan. 28 at No. 14 Oregon State
The Beavers had a successful 2020-2021 season and shut down the Trojans offense in the one game between the two teams. Forward Alissa Pili was the only player capable of putting up double-digit points against Oregon State, and after a trip to the Round of 32, the Beavers are expected to have an even better season this year. 
The Oregon State game will prove pivotal for the Trojans because it comes in the middle of a three-game stretch where USC will face No. 20 UCLA, No. 14 Oregon State and No. 10 Oregon. The Trojans will be lucky to win one game in this stretch but just one victory would be a huge resume boost and could be the reason the Trojans are selected for the NCAA tournament. 
The game against the Beavers is the most important of the three games since it starts the Trojans’ road trip and could prevent the team from spiraling into two-straight losses before taking on Oregon.
Feb. 4 vs UC Berkeley
USC’s game against UC Berkeley comes during the Trojans’ roughest patch of the season, making the game of the utmost importance. The Trojans will play the Golden Bears after facing No. 20 UCLA, No. 14 Oregon State and No. 10 Oregon and immediately before hosting the No. 3 Stanford Cardinal. 
USC could very well go 0-4 against those teams and to prevent the Trojans from letting the season snowball into disaster, USC will need a victory over California. The Trojans enjoyed its second-largest win of last season when the team beat the Golden Bears 77-54, but nothing is guaranteed, especially in the middle of that difficult stretch of the season. The matchup is also the first time Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb will play the former school she coached.
Feb. 6 vs No. 3 Stanford
Stanford went on to win the National Championship last season and ended USC’s season in the process with a 92-53 win over the Trojans in the second round of the Pac-12 tournament. 
The Trojans also lost both regular season games against the Cardinal by a total of 47 points. USC would be fortunate to come out of the Feb. 6 game with a close loss, but a win may be the tipping point to get the Trojans selected for its first NCAA tournament berth since 2014. 
This will be no easy feat as the Cardinal dropped only twoPac-12 games last season and have the winningest women’s college basketball coach in NCAA history in Tara VanDerveer. 
Feb. 26 at No. 22 Arizona
The Trojans end their season with a difficult road game against the 2021 NCAA tournament runner-up No. 22 Arizona. 
USC will come off one of its easiest stretches of the season after matching up against five-straight unranked teams, at least in the preseason rankings. The Wildcats will be the last opportunity to get a quality win for the Trojans. In the 2020-2021 season, Arizona narrowly defeated USC 78-77 and only six Wildcats scored with Aari McDonald and Cate Reese combining for 55 points. 
Luckily for the Trojans, Arizona’s highest scorer from that game with 30 points, Aari McDonald, moved on to the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream, giving USC a shot at redeeming themselves from last year’s nailbiter loss.

The global population currently peaks at 7.9 billion people and is projected to reach nearly 9.7 billion by 2050. More people means more industrialization and greater competition for scarce resources, such as arable land and water. As demand grows and agriculture suppliers struggle to produce sufficient food quantities, scientists are brainstorming ways to best increase the efficiency of our food production systems. 
As the demand for food spikes, the agriculture industry is under more stress than ever. In the past 40 years, the Earth has lost one-third of its arable land because of factors such as pollution, erosion and human expansion. These pressures demand that farmers and food producers do the impossible — exponentially increase their output while minimizing their environmental impact.
While I wish I could explore all the creative ways scientists are working to maximize food production, let me pivot to a potential food production alternative that’s increased in popularity these past several decades — aquaculture. The practice of farming fish, bivalves — such as oysters and mussels — and even kelp has taken off in the past few decades, presenting us with an opportunity to expand crop production to an entirely new realm. 
From freshwater tanks on land to large, open-ocean sea cages, ocean domestication is beyond interesting and definitely worth exploring. Not to mention the fact that these methods are significantly less carbon-intensive than traditional farming and animal domestication. While wild fisheries have plateaued in terms of productivity, aquaculture is an untapped frontier with a potentially huge global market. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, fish now accounts for 17% of the world’s protein intake. 
Aquaculture can take many forms — from coastal salmon farms in the Pacific Northwest to lagoons full of bivalves in my hometown of San Diego — and contains undeniable benefits waiting to be reaped. Aquaculture can potentially reduce stress and overfishing of wild marine fisheries while creating jobs for locals in coastal areas around the world. Additionally, sticking to species that occupy lower trophic levels means minimal resource input on farmers’ parts — photosynthesizers and filter feeders can essentially feed themselves with what already exists in their environments. Especially when it comes to crops like kelp and bivalves, widespread aquaculture could produce a cheaper and more widely accessible source of protein.
Particularly, seaweed has high potential to become an ocean superfood. It yields an extremely high growth rate, requires minimal nutrient input because it photosynthesizes, and has high nutritional benefits. Because it is produced in such great quantities, it can be a viable food source for humans and livestock as well as an energy-dense biofuel.
Climate sciences also herald seaweed as a potential solution to climate change. As the ocean continues to acidify, it grows even more efficiently by capturing carbon dioxide for photosynthetic processes. This process of carbon sequestration essentially siphons out excess carbon dioxide in the water and could actually help mitigate the acidification process if implemented on a large enough scale. 
Aquaculture isn’t completely immune to some of the drawbacks that afflict terrestrial farming. The so-called sustainability of any aquaculture system highly depends on the system’s resources and their impact on the surrounding ecosystem. Additionally, some of the larger species grown in captivity require high levels of feedstock inputs, making the entire process just as energy intensive as land processes. 
In open bodies of water, the risk of aquaculture-raised fish escaping runs high, with consequences such as genetic alteration and disease spread into wild populations at stake. It’s also worth mentioning that excessively large aquaculture operations can cause pollution in the surrounding ecosystem and disease outbreaks among fish can lead to antibiotic and growth hormone usage to maintain quality levels. 
I’d also be remiss if I didn’t address the biggest dilemma facing the budding industry — the farmed fish debate. Consumers assume wild-caught seafood is more nutritious and natural than its farmed counterpart; however, this isn’t always the case. While farm-raised varieties can contain higher levels of contaminants and antibiotics, bioaccumulation becaused pollution conditions may make wild-caught fish just as susceptible to the same contaminants. The best solution we have to decode the kind of fish we’re eating? Don’t trust everything you read on labels — it’s crucial to educate ourselves on common aquaculture and commercial fishing processes.
Aquaculture is at a pivotal point — most practices are still relatively small in size and revenue, and greater commercial and scientific investment would popularize the idea to create a greater global market of potential consumers.
As for now, establishing good sustainability practices and minimizing ecosystem impacts is the most important investment in our future. Traditional agriculture alternatives are imperative, and we aren’t doing ourselves any favors if we expand to the oceans without adequate scientific research and protective policies in place.
The most logical path forward is a dual focus on greater sustainability and scalability. Keeping aquaculture practices relatively small and local while prioritizing good environmental stewardship is a necessary investment in the industry’s renewability and longevity. Aquaculture is no longer a question of technological capacity but one of increasing governmental support and furthering scientific development. 
Perhaps eating sushi made from farmed fish or commercially-sourced seaweed salad doesn’t have the same ring to it as a wild-caught king salmon dinner. But, for the sake of our food security, it’s time to reconsider — and improve — the way things end up on our plate.

“Insecure’s” final season kicked off Sunday night with the same brand of unfeigned, gorgeously shot comedy that earned the show nearly a dozen Emmy nominations.
The HBO comedy-drama series follows Issa (Issa Rae), a Black woman living in Los Angeles in her early 30s who struggles to overcome relationship drama, social issues and her own inner anxieties alongside her best friend and fellow protagonist Molly (Yvonne Orji). Critics have praised “Insecure” for its heartfelt portrayal of Black characters’ personal strifes, which creators Issa Rae and Larry Wilmore intended to “convey that people of color are relatable … This is about regular people living life.”
Sixteen months after the season four finale, Issa is back and her writing is as insightful as ever: Rather than exceptional drama or absurd comedy, “Insecure” captures the hilarity and heartbreak of ordinary life.
Seasons one through four present the entwined lives of Issa, her long-term boyfriend Lawrence (Jay Ellis), Molly, their uptight friend Tiffany (Amanda Seales) and the riotously outspoken Kelli (Natasha Rothwell) as they go through awkward moments, recognize their own insecurities and humanize each other.
Season four left fans on a suspenseful note last June. After breaking up with Issa in the third season, Lawrence begins dating her co-worker Condola. They eventually break up and Lawrence professes his love for Issa, even asking her to move with him to San Francisco, but a twist is dropped in her lap — Condola is pregnant. Condola doesn’t want Lawrence involved, and he still loves Issa, but the situation is too much for her to bear.
Meanwhile, Issa’s friendship with Molly has deteriorated over the course of the season. Small annoyances turn to huge transgressions until, at Issa’s first important “Block Party” event, their heated confrontation sends the crowd into a panic. Now, after Andrew, Molly’s boyfriend, broke things off with her, she reached out to her former friend for help.
Picking back up from the break, “Reunited, Okay?!” finds the girls going to their 10-year college reunion. To the tune of “Choker” by Master P, a breathtaking shot of the hills cuts to Kelli, in the car with Tiffany and her boyfriend Derek, making fun of Molly’s melodramatic Instagram posts — or the “Groundhog’s Day of fuckshit” they’ve made of her timeline. It’s harsh, but they obviously care for their friend, who apparently hasn’t recovered since her breakup two months ago.
At the reunion, Kelli’s character discovers the reunion’s operators accidentally believe she died. While a hilarious recurring joke, this mistake also sets up one of the episode’s main themes: appreciation for those in your life. She stares in horror at her memoriam, which reads “she had the best stanky leg,” as the DJ plays “Stanky Leg” by GS Boyz in her memory. Kelli laughs off each joke, but it’s clear the obvious carelessness with which others treat her supposed death is hurtful.
Issa, Molly and Kelli begin to bond over running into Cheyenne (Taja V. Simpson), a former friend (who was “too crazy” for the formerly pretentious Tiffany), who encourages them to let down their more mature guards. The episode is very interested in how the characters’ behavior changed now that they’ve grown into adulthood, and this glimpse into their youthful mannerisms is a great example of that development.
An incredibly creative motif I love from this series is the use of mirrors to perform Issa’s inner monologue. Typically, this is between two versions of herself, one on each side of the mirror. In this episode, we find Issa talking to the college version of herself and ultimately finding she hasn’t accomplished as much as her younger self expected. There is some positive reflection — she confidently tells herself she “never really wanted to be a lawyer,” a very empowered decision — but also some biting self-deprecation as she snaps “Shut up, look at you.”
At the panel Issa is speaking at, it seems like the audience is against her. They clap at every word the other speakers utter, even hypnotically chanting Biggie lyrics in unison with the speaker preceding her. In contrast, they are dead silent during her portion of the discussion. Yet, I felt much more affected by Issa’s authenticity, especially her confession that she “doesn’t know that she’s on the right path.” Such uncertainty has daunted Issa for the past four seasons, but after that growth, it seems the focus is on acceptance rather than anxiety. 
Another major theme of the episode is reconciliation. Just as the panel ends, Molly — perhaps inspired by Issa’s bravery — breaks the ice by taking Issa to get a drink. This gives the pair the opportunity to talk about their relationships and past, ultimately reconciling as friends. Issa, too, brings up the powerlessness she feels in life, lamenting her lack of control. “Even with Lyft!” she exclaims. “I don’t control where I go. Bitch, no, I don’t wanna take you and your friends to Palm Springs. It’s Tuesday!”
Though some awkwardness still lingers between the two, one can feel their friendship as though they were back in college together. It was a very welcome sight to see — the portrayal of Issa and Molly’s friendship is one of the oldest and most perfect aspects of the show, what critics pointed out as a “beautiful example of the joys and complexities of black female friendship rarely seen on television.” Through all five seasons, this warm and intricate relationship is the base of the show.
Now transported back to college, the girls accept an invitation from Cheyenne to go out to a club. But, while making a stop at a liquor store, Issa, Molly and Cheyenne are robbed. They panic, and the tension skyrockets, before the masked gunman accidentally lets Cheyenne’s name slip. She had snuck into the reunion, set them up and stolen Molly’s shoes — though hilariously declined to steal Issa’s shoes.
The experience had the pair afraid for their lives, but, as soon as they get back to the car to tell Tiffany and Kelli, the tension is washed away in a torrent of laughter. The squad, newly appreciative of their health and company, adjourn to a diner and give Kelli a properly heartfelt faux funeral. The experience, and the episode as a whole, remind the characters and viewers to live life in the present and appreciate the life and company they have.
As we head into the final season, countless questions about relationships, jobs and friendships remain unaddressed — just as Issa makes clear on the panel, neither she nor the audience can be sure where the path may lead.
“Insecure” has always inspired in its audience an appreciation for the silliness and spectacle of everyday life, and “Reunited, Okay?!,” the first episode of the final season, perfectly continues that trademark sincerity for the episodes to come.
It isn’t every day that one has the chance to pick up a new show, but, if you haven’t seen it and want some laughter in your life, “Insecure” is an incredible series with 35 episodes to binge so you can catch up heading into the final season.
“Insecure” airs on HBO every Sunday at 10 p.m.

Although the pandemic was, arguably, the scariest occurrence of the year, Halloween’s annual magic and mayhem offers a much-needed escape from our daily lives. While some may have a preference for either the tricks or the treats, there is, undoubtedly, an activity for everyone. Here are some events that should satisfy your thirst for thrills (or lack thereof), all while celebrating the spirit of Halloween.
Halloween Horror Nights
After last year’s hiatus due to coronavirus, Universal Studios’ annual Halloween Horror Nights is back with a vengeance for its 30th anniversary. The theme park’s iconic Halloween event is available every Thursday through Sunday throughout October, boasting lines that are just as frightening as its Scare Zones and mazes. Some of the most bone-chilling mazes are based on horror media such as Netflix’s “The Haunting of Hill House’’ and “The Exorcist.” Additionally, longtime fans of Horror Nights will be thrilled to find that the Terror Tram that takes you to the backlots has returned and is sporting the theme of “The Ultimate Purge.” 
“The Nightmare Before Christmas” Live-to-Film Concert
Join Danny Elfman at the Banc of California Stadium on Oct. 29 and 31, as he reprises his iconic role of Jack Skellington in the cult-classic Tim Burton film, “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” Joined by popstar Billie Eilish who will sing the part of Sally, Elfman will perform his character’s songs in sync with the Disney film while it plays, accompanied by a live orchestra. 
“The Rocky Horror Picture Show”
It’s that time of the year again when the showings and shadow casts for the timeless “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” are in full force. A true definition of a cult-classic, screenings of the musical often are characterized by audience participation. At designated points in the film, costume-wearing moviegoers will shout specific lines at the screen or throw props. Shadow casts (actors who act out the movie in sync with the playing film) are also a popular addition to the screenings. These productions are perfect if you want to get into the Halloween Spirit but would prefer a night of good old-fashioned vulgarity as opposed to actual fear.
“Delusion: Reaper’s Remorse”
“Delusion: Reaper’s Remorse” is an interactive theatrical experience that offers its participants an evening of horror. The show takes place at the real-life historic Phillips Mansion built and resided in by Louis Phillips, who became the richest man in Los Angeles County by the end of the 1800s. However, the show’s plot, concocted by Delusion creator Jon Braver ,revolves around Esther Phillips, Louis’s wife, a collector of occult objects with even darker secrets. The audience plays the part of fellow occult lovers, whom Esther invites to view her macabre collections before the visit goes awry.   
Los Angeles Haunted Hayride
The Los Angeles Haunted Hayride has officially returned to Griffith Park and its setting of a fictitious ‘80s town entitled Midnight Falls. While the entire Midnight Falls town experience is essentially a scare zone, the town also includes three unique mazes: “Dead End Diner,” “Trick or Treat” and the “Midnight Mortuary.” And of course, there exists the titular Haunted Hayride experience where the Witch of the Woods’ magical meddlings result in the summoning of underworld spirits to torment ride goers. The hayride itself is chock-full of scares that promise to give audiences a terrifyingly good time. 
Knott’s Scary Farm
Every Halloween season, the Knott’s Berry Farm theme park in Buena Park transforms into the fan-favorite Knott’s Scary Farm. Similar to Halloween Horror Nights, Knott’s Scary Farm offers Scare Zones and mazes galore; however, the latter has more options in terms of shows such as “Invitation to Terror” and “Conjurers – Magic and Mirth at the Birdcage Hotel.” Attendees can also appreciate that Knott’s Scary Farms’ mazes are based completely on original content. This year, Knott’s offers a brand new scare zone entitled “The Gore-ing ‘20s” filled with otherworldly flappers and bootlegging gangsters as well as a new maze, “Mesmer: Sideshow of the Mind,” where attendees are haunted by Hypnotist Mesmer and his sinister antics.
Nights of the Jack
