A group of USC engineering students traveled to Reno, Nev., last week to participate in “Sparks,” a construction management competition for university students sponsored by the Associated Schools of Construction and large construction firms.
At the competition, the students competed in mock construction projects to produce cost estimates, a construction schedule, and project management plans. They then presented their projects to mock clients and a firm that had actually done the project.
Six undergraduate teams and two graduate teams from USC competed in the event. One USC undergraduate team won first place in the design-build division and another won second place in the commercial division. A USC graduate team won first place in the LEEDS division, beating out Berkeley and Stanford. USC sophomore Elton Kwok also received an individual student award for most valuable student.

For the first time in California’s history, community college students are facing a new challenge in transferring to four-year private universities.
The biggest hurdle for potential transfers used to be getting in to the school of their choice. Now, some community college students are facing a second problem — getting the classes they need to transfer.
“I’m scared I won’t get into my first choices,” said Lara Kasian, a sophomore at Glendale Community College who hopes to transfer in the fall to USC, UCLA or Berkeley. “Because of the budget cuts my chances are getting slimmer and slimmer.”
Tim Brunold, USC’s director of undergraduate admission, said transfers from community colleges make up about two thirds of USC’s total transfer population.
“In that sense, they are an important part to USC,” Brunold said.
But for many of the 2.9 million students who attend California’s 110 community colleges, transferring to a four-year university is becoming an overwhelming challenge.
The California State Legislature originally  estimated it would receive $130 million in stimulus funds, but the state only received $35-37 million in the fall, Vice Chancellor of California Community Colleges Terri Carbaugh previously told the Daily Trojan.
“I have been doing this for 21 years, and I have never seen anything like it,” said Daniel L. Nannini, transfer center coordinator at Santa Monica College. “A student who used to think they could leave in two years is becoming unlikely.”
California’s community colleges are restricting their budgets and struggling to accommodate a surge of high school students, military veterans and unemployed workers seeking training for a new job.
“We hit the perfect storm,” Nannini said. “2008 to 2009 was the biggest class of high school graduates. The economy is tanking. The [University of California schools] are reducing the number of students they can take. When people are unemployed, they go back to community college. It’s a tidal wave.”
With more people than ever turning to the community college system, the state’s tight budget has forced these colleges to cut courses and services and, in some cases, limit admission.
“For the first time in the history of California education, schools will not provide access to students who meet the minimum requirements,” said Kevin Meza, transfer coordinator at Glendale Community College.
And for the students who are admitted to community colleges, getting the classes they want or need to take is becoming increasingly difficult and some are reduced to being part-time students.
“Students are pretty bummed … and they are angry,” Nannini said. “They are really mad that they can’t find the classes they need to transfer.”
Nannini said one of his students walked into his office last week with a checklist of 55 classes she tried to get into by showing up. She failed to get in to a single one.
Students have a legitimate worry, Meza said.
California’s Master Plan for Higher Education, which was created in 1960, guaranteed that UC schools would select from among the top 12.5 percent of a graduating class, the California State Universities from the top 33.3 percent and community colleges had to admit any student. That does not always hold anymore.
“Up until a year ago I could guarantee students admission into a certain college campus … Some schools are starting to eliminate that,” Meza said. “Its uncharted waters.”
Kasian, whose two cousins transferred out of Glendale Community College in 2004 and 2008, said having good grades was enough then to get them into a four-year university — but not now.
“There is no way to deal with it,” Kasian said. “It motivates me to work harder.”
Brunold said USC prefers community college students who are enrolled full time. Transfer applicants are also highly encouraged to complete courses equivalent to USC’s General Education classes before they apply.
Though USC has not made any formal changes to its requirements, Brunold said students who have been affected by the budget cuts can still apply and will still be considered.
“The more a student can tell us about their situation the better we can be about considering it,” Brunold said.
The statewide budget cuts are also creating a backlog of transfers. Some of the state’s public universities have cut down on the number of transfers they can take, increasing the competition and leading more to turn to private schools.
CSU Pomona, for example, saw a 97 percent increase in transfer applicants, according to Deborah Brandon, executive director of admissions. But to meet the CSU mandate of reducing 2,000 students over a two-year span, CSU Pomona plans to reduce its entering class by one third.
Though USC did not see a drastic jump, Brunold said the number of community college transfer applicants increased by about 3 percent this year.
Nannini said these factors are forcing students to take advantage of any opportunity they can get.
“Get your degree where you can get your degree,” Nannini said. “That is the direction we are heading to.”

Alkaline Trio is a punk band. Punk music, by definition, is and has always been an anti-establishment form of expression that aims to blatantly defy and oppose mainstream culture. The Hills is not punk. It came as somewhat of a surprise, then, when the nearly 14-year-old Chicago band Alkaline Trio appeared on MTV’s reality show — infamous for catty drama and the glamorization of material objects.
God Dammit · Alkaline Trio has released seven albums during its 13-year career. For its latest, This Addiction, the band went back to its roots. - Photo courtesy of Epitaph Records
The band debuted on the show in an effort to promote its sixth album, Agony & Irony, its first release on the major label Epic Records. Although this appearance happened about two years ago, the band has had to endure a great deal of criticism from its original hardcore fans for being on the show and having an association with a major record label. To many, the fateful appearance cemented the band’s image as being detached from its punk roots.
On its seventh and newest album entitled This Addiction, however, Alkaline Trio returned to those roots, dropping the major label for its own independent one, Heart and Skull Records, in association with parent company Epitaph Records. The band even returned to its hometown of Chicago to record the new album in the studio where it recorded its initial albums, Goddamnit and Maybe I’ll Catch Fire.
The result is an interesting mix of a return to the band’s earlier style and an evolution from its previous efforts. Many of the songs on This Addiction sound like those on the band’s earliest albums, as they consist of a more organic and stripped-down melodic punk.
With song titles like “Lead Poisoning,” “Dead on the Floor,” “Eating Me Alive” and “Piss and Vinegar,” it is apparent that Alkaline Trio has not abandoned its notoriously gloomy and depressing traditional subjects. Also in typical Trio fashion, these gruesome and heartbroken lyrics are sung with “a good voice,” as one of The Hills girls quipped on the show, over loud and fast, driving pop-punk backing tracks.
While many of the songs sound similar to the band’s earlier, less commercial work, some of them include additional elements that hint at musical evolution. “Lead Poisoning,” for instance, includes a horn solo, which is not usually present in the Trio’s music. The horn solo fits into the song, providing an enjoyable, unexpected sonic element that only proves that Alkaline Trio is continuing to evolve musically and creatively rather than just attempting to recreate its older albums.
Similarly, “Draculina” contains an organ and an interesting, echoing vocal effect throughout the song. Although pianos and additional instruments are not totally foreign to Alkaline Trio, the band still manages to implement the instruments into its songs while maintaining an organic sound, neither overproduced nor unnecessarily flashy.
The addition of synthesizer on the very next song, “Eating Me Alive,” however, sounds incredibly cheesy. It’s this song that reminds listeners of the band’s attempt to garner radio play and commercial success.
Other reminders of the band’s attempt to break into mainstream culture could be seen when they played a sold-out show at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip last Tuesday. Matt Skiba, the band’s guitarist and singer, donned a Ralph Lauren polo, and a handful of semi-famous celebrities, including Tyson Ritter from All-American Rejects and Kat Von D from the television show L.A. Ink, watched from the balcony. The band played old classics such as “’97” and “Nose Over Tail” while die-hard fans sang and screamed along in the pit, but it was hard to ignore how far the band had strayed from its punk roots in recent years.
The band, however, does not seem totally ashamed of its efforts at breaking into mainstream pop culture. It preformed “In Vein,” the same song that was played on The Hills, at the concert, along with a variety of newer songs. At the same time, however, bassist and singer Dan Andriano said that the next song “never meant as much [to him] as it does now” before driving into the incredibly dark “One Hundred Stories,” which includes lyrics such as No one could tell even if I fell 100 stories straight down, down, down. Despite spending time in sunny Los Angeles and many attempts to breaking into mainstream culture, Alkaline Trio still maintains its dark and gloomy edge.
This Addiction demonstrates that fact, as the lyrics are angst-ridden and depressing, and the music is as loud and fast as it was on the band’s earliest albums. Ralph Lauren and The Hills may not be considered punk, but maybe it’s the fact that Matt Skiba doesn’t seem to care that he’s living in Los Angeles and wearing designer clothes that actually makes him punk. No matter its association with mainstream culture or punk roots, Alkaline Trio managed to make This Addiction an enjoyable album that is both similar to its older work and a musical representation of a creative evolution.

In a final tune-up before the start of the Pac-10 conference slate of matches, the No. 5 USC men’s tennis team hosts No. 63 San Diego State today at 3:30 p.m.
Tune up · Sophomore Steve Johnson and the Trojans will use their dual meet against San Diego State to prepare for upcoming Pac-10 play. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
With two matches at California and Stanford this upcoming weekend, the Trojans (9-1, 0-0) hope to continue gaining experience and confidence against the Aztecs before the all-important conference season commences.
Coming home  after four matches away from Marks Tennis Stadium  will allow USC another opportunity to display consistency throughout the lineup against a team that has played better than its record indicates.
Last Saturday, San Diego State (1-5, 0-0) won the important doubles point against No. 6 UCLA  in a match it eventually lost 5-2.
For the Trojans — where doubles play remains a point of emphasis — the Aztecs demonstrated that they could test the Trojans’ doubles lineup. Although the Trojans have won the doubles point in nine of their 10 matches, the team continues to search for the best lineup combinations and steady contributions from all three spots.
SDSU marked its first match victory of the season against UC Santa Barbara last Sunday. UCSB is the same team that played well against USC in the second match of the season, which USC won 4-3.
Although the Aztecs do not have any players ranked in singles or in doubles, their performance last weekend demonstrated they are improving as a squad.
Aztec No. 1 singles player Achim Ceban defeated UCSB’s Philip Therp in straight sets during SDSU’s 4-2 victory.
Doubles were not contested in the dual meet after SDSU clinched the victory with strong singles play.
USC’s recent road performance proved to be a positive lesson for the squad heading into this match.
“I loved playing on the road,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “I was very impressed how we handled the stress of Pepperdine.”
USC did not return from the road matches unscathed — losing to No. 4 Texas — but finished strong with quality wins against UCLA and Pepperdine.
The lessons from the trip will be crucial when conference play begins, as the Trojans start tackling the first of their main goals this year — winning the Pac-10 conference title.
With all of the challenges on the upcoming schedule, SDSU is not a team that can be overlooked.
The Trojans do not plan on having a letdown against the Aztecs, as they still feel they have aspects to improve upon themselves.
“We weren’t perfect, and that’s what we will keep working for,” Smith said.

USC baseball coach Chad Kreuter stood off the third-base line, peering down to the right at his designated hitter.
Kreuter’s team was trailing Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 4-3, in the top of the eighth inning. His freshman catcher, Robert Stock, had just singled to centerfield, putting the team’s tying runner on base, but USC needed someone to step up and drive him in.
Only five outs remained between a series loss and a late-inning comeback.
Kreuter’s eyes were on the plate as a 6-foot-5, 190-pound freshman stepped into the batter’s box. But even though the 18-year-old right-handed batter was a new face to the team, he wasn’t a new face to the coach.
The hitter was Kreuter’s son, Cade.
The coach had enough faith to leave the young hitter in during a pressure situation.
When Cal Poly starter Kyle Anderson — who had cruised through a six-inning, two-run outing to that point — made a mistake on his next pitch to home plate, Cade knew exactly what to do with it.
Cade connected for a game-changing, two-run home run that cleared the left-field wall at Baggett Stadium.
The coaches cheered. The dugout roared.
And Dad looked like a genius.
It was a big moment for the Trojans, and it was a moment in which any dad would be proud of his son.
It’s even more special for a dad who gets to congratulate his son as he’s rounding third base.
“It’s a real cool moment shaking hands with your son when he’s coming around the bases,” the coach said.
Chad said he didn’t get to speak at length with his son until the ninth inning, when Chad returned to the dugout from his post as third-base coach. He was proud that his son made adjustments from an earlier at-bat in the game.
“He turned around a pitch he had struck out with and hit a home run,” Chad said.
Cade’s home run reminded his coach of another time the father and son got to shake hands at home plate after Cade launched a drive over the fence.
It was during Chad’s major league career, when he played for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He remembers hitting a home run and sharing a high five with Cade, the team’s bat boy, as he headed back to the dugout.
“It’s like we’ve come full circle.”
Baseball represents a special connection between father and son. Often, the very first person a child learns how to play catch with is his father. And because throwing and catching a Wiffle ball is fairly easy, many children begin playing catch with their dads before they can even remember.
This has translated into many great father-son duos in baseball history.
Arguably the greatest father-son combination to have played professionally is the Griffeys. (The Bonds are a pretty close second, bar steroids.)
The most memorable father-son moment ever is probably when Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr. played together in the same outfield on Aug. 31, 1990. Later that season, the Griffeys became the first and only father-son duo to hit back-to-back home runs in a Major League Baseball game.
Because of the age gap, it’s difficult for a father and a son to ever play together professionally. The Griffeys were an exception because Griffey Jr. made it to the major leagues at the young age of 19, and Griffey Sr. was at the tail end of his career in 1990.
It’s also rare for a father to be the head coach of his son’s team past little league and even rarer past high school.
So, for the Kreuter family, this is a special experience. 
In Sunday’s game, Cade made Dad proud, belting a home run that helped the Trojans defeat the Mustangs, 9-4, and earn USC a season-opening series victory.
And although Cade’s role is still yet to be defined this season, it’s a memorable moment every time he and Chad put on the same uniform at the college-baseball level.
Griffey Jr., a likely first-ballot Hall of Famer, said playing with his dad was more important to him than any other record he would go on to break.
The Kreuters should enjoy the time while it lasts.

Alison Lerner sits nervously in front of Leavey Library, playing with a gold locket around her neck, wide-eyed on a Saturday morning.
Inspired · Sophomore Alison Lerner wrote The Greenstreet Kids: The Earth Warriors, an environmental book for kids. The book was recognized by Coca-Cola Co., which selected Lerner to be a part of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic torch relay along with ten others. - Photo courtesy of Coca-Cola Co. 
Without talking to her, one never would have guessed that this unassuming, demure freshman carried the Olympic torch.
Selected by a committee at Coca-Cola Co., Lerner was one of 10 exceptional teenagers selected to participate in the Olympic Torch Relay because of her commitment to the environment. Her childrens’ book is aimed at teaching children about sustainability.
She was only 16 years old — a high school student in Los Angeles involved with the Environmental Club — when she wrote the colorfully illustrated book .
“It’s about starting with small things like turning off lights and unplugging your computer,” Alison said about beginning the path to a greener future. “Knowing about conservation is something you can grow up with.”
She wrote the book so children could adopt these habits at an early age, perhaps even telling their parents to inspire real results.
The freshman, majoring in health and humanity, first found her passion for the ecosystem as a child.
“We used to go fishing every year,” said Lisa Hestrin Lerner, Alison’s mother. “One year, the lake was closed because of pollution … and I explained to her what that was, and she was just so sad.”
“She just wanted the fish to have a place to live,” Lisa said.
As Alison grew up, she headed projects like holding a canned food drive in her kindergarten classroom to benefit manatees, starting a compost pile in her backyard during middle school and organizing beach cleanups in high school. She still organizes events and serves as the Earth Week and special events officer for the USC Environment First Club.
“[Alison] was part of a group of tremendous kids,” said Helen Tarleton, senior communication manager of Coca-Cola, including former Olympians and distinguished health professionals dedicated to healthy lifestyles.
It was all of Alison’s hard work that earned her the privilege of running with the iconic Olympic torch. For about a quarter of a mile, She carried the three-and-a-half-pound propane torch in the small town of High River, outside of Calgary, Canada stopping to give the occasional high five or take pictures with some of the locals.
“I was behind the camera the whole time,” said Jonathan Lerner, Alison’s older brother. A junior majoring in biology and political science at USC, Jonathan watched his younger sister grow up while they attended the same schools.
“She was really shy growing up,” he said. “She really just wants to make a lasting difference … to do great things. Just seeing her going from to so shy to superstar, shaking hands and being part of that world wide stage and taking to it so naturally … was something else,” Jonathan said.
“I could not stop crying,” Lisa said. “It was just a moving experience to see all these people come together for peace and friendship — and my daughter was a part of that.”
Jonathan called Alison’s opportunity to bear the torch a reward for all of her passionate work. He and Lisa traveled with Alison in January for the event, which ended in a cauldron-lighting ceremony, a spirited, peaceful celebration in the small Canadian community.
“It’s such an old tradition that brings people together from all around the world,” Alison said about her experience running in High River.
Alison still plans to keep fighting for the environment as she continues her studies.
She kept her uniform from the run as well as the torch, which can never be lit again.
“It’s so you can’t light up your barbecue with it,” she said jokingly.
This well-humored compassion is what sets Alison apart — a compassion her mother believes leads to motivation to make the world a better place.
Her mother recounted what Lerner’s grandfather Earl Hestrin, a 1949 USC graduate, said to her regarding his granddaughter’s accomplishments.
“I’m so proud of my granddaughter. But I wouldn’t expect anything less from a Trojan.”
I do believe that Alison will remember this event throughout her life and will rank it right up there with all those who earned medals during the Olympic Winter Games. She is to be commended for her contributions to our children and yes, even to us “oldies but goodies” adults for her concerns regarding the environment.

In an effort to bring awareness to their group’s cause, student members of USC’s South Asian Rural Student Aid are hosting a comedy night at Ground Zero Performance Café. SARSA, which has been around for nearly three years, raises money in order to help fund the education of children in the Sadhana Village of India. 
In addition to creating their own events, members take part in many local community service opportunities. Just recently, SARSA obtained non-profit status, and donated $1,000 this past week to Sadhana, funding a year’s worth of education for 10 children.
“Being in this USC bubble, you don’t realize how much you have until you see how other people are living,” Vice President of Operations Sarah Manchanda said. “The donation takes kids from the village and puts them on the path for schooling.”
Since the group is still relatively new, this year’s members have the unique position of molding the organization’s strategy.
Some of their current methods of fundraising include bake sales on Trousdale Parkway and charity denim sales at a local church. Riddhi Jain, the group’s vice president of finance, said the purpose of SARSA’s upcoming comedy show isn’t necessarily to raise money but to bring more exposure to the group.
“We’re trying to get our name out there on campus,” Jain said. “This is more of a marketing event.”
And as an introduction to the student body, SARSA’s upcoming event will feature a raffle, an open-mic night and performances from Indian comedians Baba Ji and Rajiv Satyal.
Satyal, who has opened for Tim Allen, Dave Chappelle and Jo Koy has been performing comedy for more than seven years after winning the amateur field of the Funniest Person in Cincinnati contest. Since then, he has performed both at the Laugh Factory and Comedy Store.
Another of his accomplishments is launching Indiancomedians.com, a site that assists event planners in booking Indian comedians, rating them according to vulgarity level. He is also on Facebook and Twitter under the name Funnyindian.
Baba Ji, the other comedian scheduled, has been performing comedy for about 10 years. He claims it all began with the feeling he received when people actually started laughing during his performance at an open mic night. Ji’s material comes from his real-life experiences including his transition from India to the United States.
“When funny things happen in your life you use them in your jokes,” Ji said. “If you tell your true story on the stage, people identify to that.”
Some of his favorite comedians include George Carlin, Louis Black, Russell Peters, Rosanne Barr and Sarah Silverman (whom he has worked with). He has done television shows and national tours. He also owns Cowboys and Turbans, the Mexican-Indian fusion restaurant inside the El Rey Theatre on Wilshire Boulevard.
“You cannot write funny; funny happens,” Ji said. “Everyone has some comic within them and that it’s just a matter of letting it mature.”
Alongside the two comedic acts there will also be multiple other acts. Natalie Anguili, a singer-songwriter from New York will be performing with  John Gudenzi from the band The Smiles. Anguili just recently released her first album, Sometimes, Always, Never.
Danielle Bennett, a senior majoring in political science, will be reciting spoken word poetry along with Cameron Ernst, a senior majoring in communication and theatre.
There will also be a performance by Aslibaat, a competive South Asian a cappella team, in addition to one by Harmeet Singh and Aabhimanyu Soin, who will be singing and playing piano.
If the above acts weren’t enough motivation to attend the event, SARSA will also be raffling off an iPod. A night that contains comedy, smoothies, a good cause and a chance at a free iPod is one that SARSA should be proud to have its group’s name on.

Now, the question here isn’t whether or not Shutter Island is a good film — because it most certainly is. The question, given the director’s glowing repertoire and ’06 masterpiece, is whether or not Shutter Island is a great film. All things considered, Shutter Island finds Martin Scorsese sorely out of his element.
Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federally appointed U.S. Marshal who has been charged with an investigation on an island just outside of Boston harbor. He and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are there to uncover the whereabouts of an escaped patient, but as the plot thickens Daniels realizes that greater evils are at work on Shutter Island.

The conventions and mainstream ties are potent, perhaps more so than the ultimate payoff, which alludes uncannily to James Mangold’s Identity. Paramount Pictures’ advertising campaign is quick to remind us that Scorsese is at the helm of the franchise, and Shutter Island accordingly bears the director’s enormously powerful signature very prominently. The film is marketed just as much through Scorsese’s prestige as it is through DiCaprio’s image as a more serious actor. Despite Scorsese’s characteristic flourishes, the movie maintains a bothersome indifference toward his unparalleled vision.
From the Wes Anderson-esque tilts and quick-pans, which induce accidental laughter, to the schizophrenic — if symbolic — temporal design, Scorsese’s signature bleeds from the paper like ink in heavy rain. Only during the narcotics-induced flashback sequences do audiences remember why they loved the director in the first place, given his distinct handling of human tragedy and carnage. Of course, these sequences are inherently short-lived and often feel mismatched with the film’s conventional reality.
The political conspiracy elements of the film are handled with proper tact and obscurity, but the film might have been better off exploring those ends. That being said, the source material is appropriately eerie, and the complexity of the story should not be trivialized. The brilliance, as in many good mysteries, is found in retrospect. Ambiguity and arbitrary elements find their place in the overarching yarn, and their symbolic nature is especially impressive.
When watching Shutter Island, the effect is purposefully jarring. Hospital-like lighting coupled with jump cuts and hallucinations make for a psychological experience that fiddles with viewers’ nerve endings. The characters are fickle and two-faced, creating further anxiety in the audience, and the depth of the dialogue is mesmerizing. The film’s maturing superstar is also particularly believable, emoting palpable heartbreak that will hopefully be remembered during the fall awards season. Most unexpectedly, it is Scorsese who muddies the waters with indecisive direction.
In many ways, Shutter Island throws back to Alfred Hitchcock films of the 1950s and ’60s. The film, which is set in 1954, not only marks the year of Rear Window and Dial M for Murder but also contains several explicit allusions to Psycho and North by Northwest.
In all the commotion, Scorsese loses himself, and the movie suffers greatly for it.
Interspersed among various homages to Hitchcock is a sense of stylized violence, which paints characters with cherry-red blood and glorifies blood and guts. The effect — clearly intentional — is disorienting, given that the film’s setting is a mental asylum but not in the correct way.
Yes, schizophrenia is one of the main themes, and the movie was designed to waver aesthetically in order to convey feelings of delusion, but the end result is a movie that forgot what it was fighting for. Scorsese’s direction is uncertain, resulting in a more manufactured experience, with potential that falls by the wayside.
It’s as if he wanted to make a movie for Hitchcock and halfway through remembered it was his all along.
In these days of torture porn and Death at a Funeral remakes, it is invigorating to see a complex picture draw decent numbers at the box office. Moreover, when contextualized into the realm of popular cinema, Shutter Island is not only refreshing but leaps and bounds better than most. The rub is that Scorsese operates in a more exclusive league. Therefore, his work must be held to different standards. On those terms, Shutter Island is not only restrained but underwhelming, sputtering to the finish with conflicting visions in tow.
I think the beauty of the entire movie is you don’t know how to feel and you don’t know which to believe. You are very much in the mind of Leo’s character. Paranoid and stuck between two different things that both could very much be true. I called it very early on. The fact that it didn’t show him anywhere else but the Ferry and the Island. He has experienced Trauma. The Doctor said he does experimental procedures. Patients seemed coached. Just met his partner. And there wasn’t much to the movie unless he was crazy. Frankly, practically from the beginning I just felt that’s the only way it could have been.
[…] His breakdown at the end is particularly impressive. As it is, however, the film is about van der BeDial M for Murder (1954) – He certainly gives the best performance in the movie, probably the best I've ever seen of him. […]

Just three years ago, Kina Grannis was a USC student secretly writing songs in campus stairwells. Today, however, the singer-songwriter and YouTube star is releasing her debut album, appropriately titled Stairwells — a coffeehouse-friendly acoustic-pop compilation that harks back to the days she spent at her alma mater.
Strong enough · Kina Grannis wrote several of the songs off her latest album, Stairwells, in actual stairwells around campus. Since graduating, the 24-year-old has maintained a fan base through her YouTube channel. - Photos courtesy of Kina Grannis 
“When I came here, music was what I really wanted to do, but at the same time I was really shy and self-conscious, so I found myself retreating to stairwells in New North, Troy Hall and VKC,” said Grannis, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in social sciences in 2007. “I just kind of sat there and wrote for hours because it was the only place I felt safe being me. I guess this album is a tribute to where I grew into an artist.”
The 24-year-old musician — who first received the attention of millions of Americans when she won the Doritos “Crash the Superbowl” contest in 2008 and currently has more than 140,000 YouTube subscribers — appeared to be much at home in McCarthy Quad for our interview.
“I’m so happy to have an excuse to come back here,” Grannis said. “I miss it.”
Grannis’ years at USC were her musical launching pad. She joined the Songwriters Club during her freshman year and was selected by the Thornton School of Music to record a CD as part of its Protégé Program, directed by Thornton’s Associate Dean of External Relations Christopher Sampson. The student-produced project developed into her first record, Sincerely, me, released in 2005.
Sampson, who became Grannis’ songwriting mentor, gave the budding artist an assignment — to wake up and write music for an hour first thing every morning.
“That’s when a ton of my writing happened,” she said.
One song on her new album, “Strong Enough,” is a product of those early morning sessions and was written during her last semester at USC.
Though she didn’t admit it to anyone at the time, Grannis confessed that music was the only thing she could imagine herself doing. So in her senior year, when she received an e-mail from a complete stranger in Austin, Texas giving her the chance to become a full-time musician after graduation, she did the unexpected and said yes.
“There was a lot of debate, but I moved to Austin … and got involved in their music community,” she said.
For six months, she sang in a now-defunct band called Doctari, raising the eyebrows of her friends and family back in California.
“The whole thing was kind of strange,” Grannis said.
Then came the Doritos “Crash the Superbowl” contest, which invited aspiring singer-songwriters to submit a song with the chance to have a music video produced and aired during the Superbowl.
Grannis submitted an original song, “Message From Your Heart,” and won. Her music video aired to 97 million Americans in a highly coveted 60-second spot after the first quarter.
“I broke down and was crying in my family’s arms for like 10 minutes,” Grannis said. “It was the most emotional thing. And at the time, I wasn’t even realizing what this meant. All I knew was that something just happened. I didn’t actually watch it at all.”
As part of the contest, Grannis also scored a record deal with Interscope Records. She then left Austin for Los Angeles and never turned back.
“It just got so crazy so quickly,” she said.
Although winning a deal with a major record label is every fledgling artist’s dream, Grannis parted ways with Interscope after just six months, finding herself at a creative crossroads with the company.
“Major labels just have so many people they need to go through before a tiny little step can get done, and it was a really slow process,” Grannis said. “At the end of the day, in my mind, the album was already written. I just wanted to record, while they still wanted to develop and have me write with other songwriters.”
Grannis decided to produce her full-length debut album independently, setting herself apart from other plucked-from-the-masses stars such as Justin Bieber and Esmée Denters who have opted to go the major label route.
“It has been a huge challenge trying to be a label by myself. Hundreds of thousands in marketing money would’ve been nice,” Grannis said. “But I had to make the album I wanted to make, have creative control and keep my YouTube, so [I don’t regret it] at all. I’m happy I did it.”
The USC alumna represents a new wave of musicians who are proving that they can make it in the music world — without the help of record companies — through media-sharing sites like YouTube and MySpace.
“The strange thing I’ve found is what people consider ‘making it.’ One way to make it is with a major label or American Idol,” Grannis said. “But I don’t think people have caught onto the fact that so many artists survive by doing it on their own.”
With the help of the Internet, her supportive family and her growing fan base, she’s proven that she can do just that.
Grannis is the 32nd most subscribed musician of all time on YouTube, a statistic that includes major artists. And some of her most popular video covers of songs by artists such as Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Michael Jackson and Jason Mraz have well over one million views.
The artist uses her online medium not only to share her acoustic covers and original songs but also to connect with fans. She frequently updates her blog and Twitter account and includes shout-outs and birthday wishes in her videos.
With each video requiring anywhere from four to eight hours to record and edit, maintaining her web presence has practically become Grannis’ full-time job.
“Sometimes I can’t believe I’ve gotten to the point where I can just do music [full time]. It’s something that I’m definitely grateful for,” Grannis said.
The singer-songwriter cites Bon Iver, Sigur Ros, Imogen Heap, K’s Choice and James Taylor as her favorite artists, and these influences come through both in her video covers and on her album.
Mostly acoustic and entirely heartfelt, Grannis’ latest album is refreshingly simple, with catchy pop hooks and soft, pleasant harmonies.
She worked with producer Rich Jacques on the record, who she met after winning the Doritos contest. Though they had initially worked together just for fun, Grannis felt Jacques truly understood where she stood as an artist. So when it came time to find a producer, she knew exactly who to ask.
“He was really good at capturing what I wanted and let me be a part of the production, which is another thing [about producing independently],” Grannis said, “Big producers will often just go and you don’t have a say in what your song will sound like. But I was there every day, playing little parts on the piano and trying to figure it all out.”
Grannis plans to tour the United States this spring and summer and hopes to eventually take her music to Europe. For now, though, she’s got a lot on her plate.
“It’s been exciting and so, so stressful,” Grannis said.
With a full-length album under her belt and a tour on the horizon, Kina Grannis has come a long way since her days at USC playing songs in stairwells, afraid to share her music with others.
But even after all this time, there’s one thing that hasn’t changed.
“There’s not many stairwells where I live now, but it’s still my favorite place to play,” Grannis said.
Thanks for writing this article ! i from france and i know she will come europe soon, i do all i can for this
What a fantastic article. As Caleb said, Kina has to be one of the most down to Earth, genuine artists around. She truly loves to connect with her fans and through everything stayed true to her craft and continues to make her music in the fashion we’ve all come to love. She probably could have “sold out” and gotten rich with Interscope, but that’s not how our Kina works.
*starts making plans on constructing a gigantic stairwell to hold a concert in*
I’d go anywhere to listen to kina’s music – I’d love to hear a concert in a stairwell some day.
I found Kina Grannis on youtube and immediately fell in love with her disturbia cover! After viewing most of her videos I became such a huge fan!! I purchased her stairwells album and I cant wait to have it on repeat!! Kina is a down to earth artist that interacts with her fans! Thats what makes her stand out!
Thank you for this wonderful article. It’s really an inspiration and Kina is an inspiration. Thank you for the insight of Kina’s Journey becoming musician. I love her music all the way, from her YouTube videos. Her music is so sincere and warmfelt something I can relate with myself. 
Congrats Kina & Stairwells!
Nice to see the mystery of the album title revealed here! I love the new record. Even knowing most of the songs from youtube, I’m hooked again.
I can’t say anything the people before me have not. This is a wonderfully written article that captures how incredible Kina Grannis truly is. I too will link it everywhere I can :)
This was a fantastic article to read. I will definitely be linking a lot of people I talk to about Kina Grannis.
Thank you so much to all the folks at USC who inspired our favorite musician! We are fans called Kinerds and we span the entire globe from Finland, to Australia, to China and to the east coast where we anxiously await her newest YouTube release. She has kept our ears in a constant state of delight and brought the flavor of SoCal coffeehouse living at its best all around the world.  USC has a right to be very proud of its stellar alumna!
Thanks for writing this article!  Kina is an inspiration to us all.
Outstanding article! Way to give the people a great insight on Kina Grannis from start till now! :) As Joseph Bayot said, “Kina is an inspiration to us all”.

Have you ever been “rated?” If so, you might be familiar with the nagging, insecure feeling that comes along with being evaluated and judged on your physical appearance. The empirical system of “hotness” rating assigns people a number on the scale of one to 10 (10 being extremely attractive and one being the human equivalent of a mole rat).
Daily Trojan | Rita Yeung
The reason we feel inclined to evaluate other people’s levels of physical attraction is elementary. It is a simple part of our mating system in which we seek out potential partners by judging their appearance to determine whether or not they would contribute the genes for strong, healthy babies. We all do it on a daily basis, consciously or not — all it takes is one look to decide whether or not someone is worth pursuing.
Our society has become so comfortable with expressing our views on others’ hotness, or lack thereof, that it has become problematic. After all, we are sensitive creatures and would all like to think we are desirable. As soon as a gaggle of guys starts hollering about how hot one girl is, every other girl in the room is going to feel at least a little insecure, if not jealous. Indeed, most of us are curious about how others would rate us and secretly hope that we’d be rated generously (at least a seven, come on!).
The soon to be released film, She’s Out of My League, centers around this rating system. A dorky boy falls for a beautiful girl, and the conflict lies in the fact that she is a 10 and he’s only a five, according to the filmmakers. The movie has launched a unique marketing campaign urging people to go online and “GET RATED!” The film also has online ads all over Facebook and celebrity websites frequented by its target audience (teenagers and 20-somethings, i.e., us).
Yes, it’s true: In case you’ve never been subjected to the superficial analysis of your peers, you can turn to the film’s website (GetYourRating.com) to find out just how hot you really are. On the surface, the site is actually pretty harmless; all you have to do to get rated is answer three arbitrary questions about yourself to get a score (the racier the responses, the better). Afterward, visitors have the option of creating a profile to compete for the chance to have their photograph plastered on a billboard in Times Square in an ad for the film.
This is where the advertising tactic gets ugly. Users’ photographs are posted to the website along with their designated rating, and others are allowed to vote on their favorites and post comments on each picture. There are hundreds of photographs on the site — hundreds of individuals looking for validation in the most judgmental and shallow environment possible.
The comments on the photographs are, of course, brutally honest, thanks to the anonymous nature of the Internet.
Plenty of other rating websites have created this public forum for superficial criticism in the past, carving out a comfortable niche within our admittedly cruel society in which we take pleasure in knowing that there are others out there who are less attractive than ourselves.
What is worrisome, however, is the fact that this film is elevating the practice of rating others to a new level of acceptance and entertainment. Middle and high school students, so easily impressionable, could embrace the hotness rating idea proposed by the film and put it to use with greater frequency than before.
The marketing campaign for She’s Out of My League is offensive on multiple levels. First, it highlights physical appearance as a person’s most important quality — which is obviously not a practice we free-thinkers tend to encourage. But more than that, the film promotes the recreational subjection of others, as if debating over numerical assignments is a game we should all be playing at parties.
Granted, the message of the film is that any average guy can end up with a stunning leading lady, but its focus has been primarily to encourage audiences to evaluate each other along with the characters in the film.
As residents of Los Angeles — the U.S. capital of cosmetic surgery, spray tans and dieting — we are no strangers to the pressures to be attractive. In fact, USC students are subject to an even greater standard because of the supposed overall hotness of our student body.
According to a 2008 list created by popcrunch.com (a serious academic source, no doubt), USC has the No. 2 hottest student body in the country. We lost to Arizona State University, but we beat out UCLA, which scored a lowly No. 7 (fight on!). Of course, the list fails to hold any actual weight, but this is just another example of those in society ranking others to assert superficial superiority.
Our university is supposed to garner a sense of pride over being “so ridiculously good-looking,” as Zoolander would put it, just because someone thinks our student population would score an average hotness rating of nine.
Admit it: your chest puffed out ever so slightly when you read our ranking.
Physical beauty is a quality we admire and covet. Though of course other qualities are also factored in determining someone’s overall value, the practice of hotness ranking seems to follow us wherever we go.
It might be human nature to appraise each other, but we certainly do not need to glorify the act. Let’s end this competition of aesthetic worth. No matter what, there will always be someone who is hotter than you and another who is uglier. Can we please move on and stop obsessing over what others think about us?
Surely we can find something more productive to do with our free time than argue about who’s hotter.

SC is putative for its “genetically-blessed” student body. Yeah, that popcrunch ranking is silly because my girlfriend who is over at that school across town, which only scored a lowly “7th,” is far better looking than probably 95% of the girls here. She doesn’t wear excess makeup, has no cosmetic surgery, watches her diet, works out 4 times a week. 
You can delude yourself into thinking you’re “A&F poster” material, but like the cliche goes: the truth hurts.

In recent months, we’ve witnessed how a new form of communication — “sexting” — can lead to a lot of trouble.
Just ask Tiger Woods, whose sexually charged cell phone chat with a mistress led to a sketchy police report, handfuls of dropped endorsements and months of tabloid turmoil.
Ouch.
A trend that’s spreading faster than a SoCal wildfire, the practice of sending sexually provocative text messages and naked pictures via cell phones has now become a digital epidemic. Seemingly unaware of the consequences, sexters just can’t get enough.
But while the plight of a superstar like Woods has been well documented, what’s more alarming is that college students and their younger teenage peers are part of a growing population of new-wave sexual communicators.
Although the sexting scare urges us to lock up our younger siblings and hold them tight, perhaps it’s us that we should be a little more concerned about.
On campus, digital interaction is an ubiquitous part of the college student’s day-to-day activities. Combine the propensity for phone usage with everyone’s favorite topic, and you have both a volatile and easy to use combination in the ever-so-popular act of sexting.
The loose social environment in college and prevalence of alcohol consumption make us more vulnerable as a group to sending the raunchy snapshots — clearly not the best example of our judgment. What started off as the classic “drunk dial” has now escalated to the “sext,” allowing potential sexual partners to harbor risqué messages that can be saved and shared with others.

Last week, MTV aired a special on the craze, “Sexting in America: When Privates go Public,” which discussed sexting’s pervasiveness in pop culture and recent popularity with everyday mobile users, especially younger ones. The TV special airs as a part of the network’s A Thin Line campaign.
Though it might seem a little outlandish for MTV to be assuming the role of the phone police, the music channel’s step to take action is actually much needed.
In a recent study by the Associated Press and MTV, approximately 30 percent of young people have either sent or received nude sext messages, while more than 60 percent of these individuals said they have been pressured more than once to participate in the promiscuous phone play.
Researchers found that barely half were concerned about the dangers of sexting, and only 25 percent acknowledged the potential legal issues surrounding sexting.
Celebrities Asher Roth and Michelle Trachtenberg and band Boys Like Girls have joined MTV’s fight against cyberbullying, online harassment and sexting. Also hoping to spread awareness are the examples set by a pair of famous flashers, Pete Wentz and Rihanna, who both felt the backlash firsthand when their nude bits were spilled across the internet after similar unfortunate cell phone episodes.
Maybe pop culture is to blame for the liberal sexual expression of teenagers today.
A generation influenced by all things Gossip Girl, the youth population seems to think it’s the social norm to send crude photos and sinful one-liners as their way of privately flirting in the digital age — only to soon find themselves publicly humiliated.
Perhaps the legal system is the only way to scare sextual deviants.
Up until now, the legal element has been a relatively unexplored scene in all the digital drama. Although some see it as harmless fun, more and more young people are on the end of nasty legal battles — including charges and allegations of distributing, possessing or producing child pornography.
While digital abuse is not a completely new concept, sexting is making it more common. The scare of online predators and creepy chat room lurkers has made the Internet less safe for youth over the years.
Now with another platform easily adept for bawdy behavior, the frenzy of concerned parents escalates.
So be forewarned — poor judgment, a night’s lack of discretion and an ill-sent sext message could have far more severe consequences on USC’s tight-knit community than your LCD screen could have ever imagined.
Fight the urge. Think of Vanessa Hudgens, and whatever you do don’t press send.

Faculty members at the USC Keck School of Medicine, along with researchers from Spain, Switzerland and other California colleges, have recently discovered that exposure to air pollution could have a significant link to the build up of plaque on artery walls.
Atherosclerosis is a coronary artery disease in which arteries become thinner due to fatty buildup on arterial walls, blocking blood flow. This causes arteries to stiffen and blood pressure to increase leading to strokes and heart attacks.
“The fact that we can detect progression of atherosclerosis in relation to ambient air pollution above and beyond other well-established risk factors indicates that environmental factors may play a larger role in the risk for cardiovascular disease than previously suspected,” said Howard N. Hodis, director of the USC Atherosclerosis Research Unit and professor of medicine and preventive medicine at the university in a press release.
One study included more than 1,000 Los Angeles residents as its participants, and investigators found that those living within 100 meters of high traffic corridors, such as freeways, had an accelerated progression of artery wall thickness of 5.5 micrometers a year, more than twice the annual development of people who lived further away.
In recent years animal studies have shown that certain particle matter from traffic and other outdoor air pollutants can accelerate atherosclerosis, but the Keck study is the first of its kind to investigate the relationship in humans.

The No. 5 USC women’s golf team looks to build its spring season momentum this week at the Wildcat Invitational at the Arizona National Golf Club in Tuscon, Ariz.
USC enters the Wildcat Invitational having won the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge less than two weeks ago, hoping build additional confidence.
“It feels good to win,” sophomore Jennifer Song said. “But we know it’s just the beginning.”
The tournament features strong competition, with eleven of the top 25 teams in the nation attending. The Women of Troy will see Pac-10 rivals, including No. 1 Arizona State, as well as some teams from the farther away regions of the country.
“We’re playing some teams like Auburn [No. 3], Tennessee [No. 6] and Oklahoma State [No. 19],” said USC coach Andrea Gaston. “I feel like the competition will be a little more difficult.”
Song, the No. 1 golfer in the nation, leads the team this week as she enters just her fourth tournament of the year. In the team’s last victory, Song finished second overall. Given her individual victories in her first two tournaments of the season, second place was her worst finish of the season. She’s looking to return to the winner’s circle this week.
“Every tournament I play, I play it to win as a team and as an individual,” Song said.
This week, Song will be seeking a school record for career rounds in the 60’s. One more round in the 60’s will give her 13 for her career, surpassing the USC record currently held by Irene Cho, who graduated in 2006, and senior Belen Mozo.
Junior Lizette Salas enters the Wildcat Invitational seeking her second individual win of the season. Salas, a two-time All American, is fully recovered from a back injury that plagued her through the summer and into the fall. She finished fifth at the Northrop Grumman, and looks to top that this week.
Mozo, a three-time All-American, struggled with injuries throughout the fall, but appears ready to threaten at every tournament again. She returned for the spring with a tie for 12th at the Northrop Grumman, her best finish of the season so far. She, like Song, can set a school record with a round in the 60’s this week.
Rounding out the top five for the Women of Troy are senior Caroline Kim and sophomore Inah Park. They are the only two members of the team to play in every tournament this season, and both turned in solid performances to begin the spring season.
The Women of Troy know the victory at the Northrop Grumman gives them additional confidence, but it also puts a target on their backs.
“The other teams want to win too, so they’ll be working twice as hard,” Song said. “We can’t take anything for granted.”
