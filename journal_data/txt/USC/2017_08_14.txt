 
USC Village and its eight new residential colleges will open its doors to about 2,700 undergraduate residents on Aug. 17. The $650 million project is currently undergoing final touches before its debut this fall.
The introduction of eight new residential colleges will increase university housing options and expand the development of the University’s residential education system. The Bohnett, Cale, Cowlings, Irani, Nemirovsky and Priam residential colleges will house continuing undergraduate students, while the McCarthy Honors College will be home to more than 500 freshmen for the 2017-18 school year.
“There are spaces for roughly 560 students [in each building] so [McCarthy Honors College] will be the largest freshmen residential college,” said Emily Sandoval, the director of the Office for Residential Education.  “There are 18 RAs here. New North Residential College is really large but there are 16 RAs there. This is slightly larger than [New North].”
Professors Laura Baker, Ruth Chung, Broderick Leaks, John Pascarella, Neelesh Tiruviluamala and Trisha Tucker will serve as the six new residential faculty members to reside in USC Village.  After a thorough selection process, the six faculty members are set to move in in early August. Residential college coordinators will live in the residential colleges and host dinners and different workshops for students.
“The residential college coordinators are full-time professionals,” Sandoval said. “They got their master’s [degrees] and they work with college students. There’s five of them, so they supervise the 50 RAs and work directly with six faculty [members].”
Most of the buildings will be suites or apartments, similar to current housing options available in the Parkside area. USC Village will also include a Harry Potter-inspired dining hall adjacent to McCarthy Honors College, featuring stained glass windows and banners of the 14 residential colleges.
The new dining hall will replace Café 84 and serve students at USC Village as well as West Residential College. With the opening of USC Village, existing undergraduate housing options such as the Troy complex will be repurposed to house graduate students.

USC Village was intentionally designed as a space for both students and the local community. A space in Building 1 (located on the corner of Hoover and 30th) will be open to the community to use, serving as a center for residents to gather. There will be a large welcome event for the public on Aug. 19.
USC Village will include approximately 115,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. Some tenants at the newly built retail-residential complex include Target, Trader Joe’s, Starbucks, Bank of America, Trejo’s Tacos and Village Cobbler.
Target was the first retailer open to the public on July 23, and Trader Joe’s consequently opened on Aug. 4. Cava, a Mediterranean restaurant, was the first dining destination to open on Aug. 8.
An underground parking structure and the new Shrine Parking Structure will provide additional parking spaces for visitors, students and faculty.
Other notable highlights of  USC Village include a 30-foot statue of Hecuba, a queen of Troy during the Trojan War, which will be mounted at the center of the main piazza; a 60-foot rectangular fountain and a new gym facility for all USC students.
Brittany Hoang, a rising sophomore majoring in business administration, was one of the few  students to snag a four-person apartment in Building 6. Hoang appreciated USC Village’s convenient location and security measures.
“As a sophomore, I’m excited to be living in a community setting again, especially with the nicer renovations,” Hoang said. “I’m hoping this will make the commute easier for a lot of students, while providing them with the same feeling of safety like the dorms did on campus.”
Kelly Pascual, a sophomore majoring in business administration, will also be living in Building 6 and looks forward to the new additions.
“I expect that it’s going to be good because of how much time was spent reconstructing the Village and making sure that it will be the best for students,” Pascual said. “The new gym and the new Target will make things more convenient for the students.”

Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
On the surface, the USC women’s volleyball program appears to have held steady through a placid offseason. The team’s core has remained mostly intact while only two freshmen have been added to the roster.
Small changes, however — paired with player and personnel development — have accumulated since the spring as the team tries to erase the memory of last year’s mediocre season. The Trojans are on a march toward a singular goal in 2017: winning the national championship.
“This season already feels different in a good way,” senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie said. 
The fourth-year veteran said seniors were taking responsibility, and summer open practice has been well-attended and more competitive.
Most importantly, she added, this team has better relationships with one another. There is trust.
“We are direct and open with each other,” Abercrombie said. “We all feel like we’re sisters. We would do anything for each other.”
The sisterly bonds solidified during the team’s early-summer Eurotrip. From Iceland to Germany, the Trojans embarked on a 12-day tour across five countries — including Austria, Slovenia and the Czech Republic — and they faced off against six national teams and a World University Games team.
Abercrombie called the trip “eye-opening,” but not just because they faced top-level competitors. 
“Eye-opening in the sense of relationships with each other,” she said. “Just hanging out all the time makes you closer to someone. Whether you get along or not, you care about them. I think we developed more trust for each other.”
In 2016, the Trojans completed Pac-12 play at a middling 10-10. On the court, they appeared to be lacking the panache, the swagger that made them near-unbeatable 2015 Pac-12 Champions. Namely, they missed the 2015 AVCA National Player of the Year, outside hitter Samantha Bricio. Bricio averaged 6.5 points per set her senior season. Her replacement, Khalia Lanier, averaged 4.5 a year ago. 
“[Lanier] has the ability to average 5.5,” head coach Mick Haley said. 
As a sophomore, she is already the centerpiece of USC’s multifaceted offense.
“We’ve felt all along that the combination of players we’ve had to go along with Khalia would bring the scoring that we lost from Bricio,” Haley said.
Haley is excited about this team’s scoring ability. Because of it, he said, this team has an “outside shot” of returning to the Final Four and winning it all.
“It’s going to take a lot of work,” Haley said.
This team knows hard work. Though Lanier is their primary scorer, the Trojans have an experienced squad. Abercrombie is one of three seniors (alongside middle blocker Jordan Dunn and opposite hitter Niki Withers) who will start. The rest of the roster features four juniors, four sophomores and two freshmen. This team is more mature and better developed than last year’s. 
Haley credited the offseason culture change to his veteran leaders like Abercrombie.
“Brittany is one of the kids who has worked extremely hard on her own game but also her leadership,” Haley said. “Certainly that’s what you like to see from your seniors.”
Haley is a veteran himself, entering his 17th season at the helm of the women’s volleyball team. He led the program to back-to-back national championships in 2002 and 2003.
“He runs a tight ship,” Abercrombie said. “He harps on us about discipline.” 
That will never change, she said, but Abercrombie also highlighted her coach’s flexibility every offseason, when he implements strategic changes.
Since Abercrombie arrived four years ago, she has noticed myriad positive changes.
“We’ve changed our practices, weight training workouts, nutrition, study habits, eating habits and sleep habits,” she said. “We’ve put a lot of effort into being the best we can be … to propel us to our goal of a national championship.” 
Though Haley appreciates Abercrombie’s praise, the head coach credited his team for embracing every adjustment.
“I don’t think I’ve done all that much, but I sure think the team has done a lot,” Haley said. “They have bought into all that I’ve asked them to do.”
Haley also orchestrated two key personnel changes this offseason. In the spring, he hired Alexis Olgard as operations director, and in July, he promoted Jason Kennedy to associate head coach. His motivation behind both moves was to keep the program close to its core values, its chronicled success and its hardest workers. 
Kennedy has been at USC since 2011. For four seasons, he was the program’s technical director, or as Abercrombie put it, “the stats guy.” Kennedy was responsible for preparing scouting reports, game-planning and video analysis. He also did similar work for Team USA during the 2012 Olympics and gained coaching experience at the club level.
In 2015, Haley made Kennedy an assistant head coach. All told, he has watched and charted close to 1,000 matches. Kennedy, a key figure behind player development, has grown in his own right as a coach.
“Moving him forward was absolutely important,” Haley said. “He’s a great communicator … and a tireless worker.”
Haley said Kennedy has been working non-stop for almost three months to prepare for the 2017 season.
“He’s completely thriving as a coach,” Abercrombie said. “He has a huge role in the organization of the team and keeping us motivated, but he also contributes a huge technical aspect that we use during film and scouting other teams.”
Olgard, meanwhile, was a four-year starting middle blocker at USC from 2010 to 2013, when she was part of two national semifinalist teams (2010-11) and won one Pac-12 Championship (2011).
Now, Olgard follows two-time national champion Katie Olsovsky and two-time national semifinalist Katie Fuller on the list of USC stars who played for Haley and returned to coach under him.
“Having our players return absolutely helps our younger players in the program,” Haley said. “[Olgard] is another person to share what you can expect when you get into the meat of the conference schedule.” 
Olgard will share those experiences often this year as a typically challenging conference slate looms. USC kicks off Pac-12 play on Sept. 20 at No. 13 UCLA and then goes two months before a rematch against its crosstown rival at the Galen Center on Nov. 25, which will be Senior Night and the team’s regular season finale.
In between, the Trojans will play 18 matches, including a home-and-away series versus defending national champion and No. 2 Stanford. They face similar series against all other Pac-12 teams except Oregon State and No. 18 Oregon, who face USC once on Oct. 24 and Nov. 22, respectively. 
On Aug. 25, the Trojans start their non-conference campaign against Loyola Marymount at 11 a.m. at Gersten Pavilion. The two squads are joint hosts of the weekend’s tournament, which also features Albany and Michigan.
Michigan is one of three non-conference opponents USC will face that finished last season ranked (USC received votes, but did not earn a ranking). The Trojans will face the other two, Creighton and Kentucky, in a doubleheader the following Saturday, Sept. 2, at the Bluejay Invitational in Omaha, Neb.
These games will be an early barometer for USC’s offseason gameplan — and Haley hopes they will set the tone on the quest for another national championship.

Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
Before current head coach Keidane McAlpine arrived at USC in 2014, the women’s soccer program was experiencing a downturn. The team had not compiled a winning record since 2010, and McAlpine knew there would be no quick, easy fix to right the ship. So the former Washington State coach instituted a three-year plan to change the program’s trajectory and bring it back to national prominence. 
Three years later, the Trojans enter 2017 as the defending national champions, having beaten West Virginia 3-1 in last season’s College Cup Final. 
McAlpine called his shot and watched it go in, but now a new question emerges: What happens next? 
“We’re back at square one a little bit having graduated quite a few of our impact players,” McAlpine said. “We have to go back to the beginning and make sure that the lessons that we learned over the last three years are not forgotten. But at the same time, we’re not at the beginning in the sense that we’ve had some unbelievable experiences over the last three years that current players can now use as fuel.” 
Back in January, five USC players were selected in the National Women’s Soccer League Draft — the most out of any school. The Trojans lost stalwarts such as midfielder Morgan Andrews, who was taken third overall by the Boston Breakers. Andrews was the team’s top goal scorer last season and a finalist for the MAC Hermann Trophy, which honors the top player in Division I soccer.
The Trojans also bid farewell to striker Katie Johnson, whose two goals in the national championship game propelled the team over West Virginia. Reigning Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Year Sammy Jo Prudhomme moved on to the NWSL as well after recording a stellar 15 shutouts in 25 games in 2016. Defender Kayla Mills, a three-time All-Pac-12 First Team honoree, and 2016 Pac-12 Defender of the Year Mandy Freeman now ply their trade for Sky Blue FC.
While the NWSL Draft may have highlighted the program’s vitality, it also signaled a new challenge for McAlpine: He now has to replace players who have anchored the team since he first arrived.
“This team is just going to be different,” McAlpine said. “I think, on last year’s team, we had some brilliant individual performances. This year’s group is going to share the ball a little bit more, [be] quicker and have to rely on the unit a lot more to get things done. That’s not necessarily a bad thing — I think it’s going to be a great thing.” 
Without many of last year’s star players, the Trojans will need some newer faces to emerge and fill the void. McAlpine expects junior Leah Pruitt and redshirt senior Alex Anthony to step into larger roles this fall spearheading the USC attack.
McAlpine also highlighted senior midfielder Sydney Sladek and junior defender Ally Prisock, who will provide veteran leadership behind the forwards.
Last year, USC’s hallmark was its suffocating style of play. The team led the Pac-12 in virtually every defensive category, even recording more shutouts (six) than goals conceded (five) in conference play. The Trojans return two defenders — Prisock and sophomore Julia Bingham — from last year’s group, but they also have the unenviable task of replacing Prudhomme. Her likely successor, senior Julia Murphy, has played just five games in her career. 
In the later rounds of the NCAA Tournament, the Trojans often relied on superior defensive play when they were unable to produce goals (USC scored just three goals in the four games leading up to the final). With a new and inexperienced goalkeeper, the team may not have the same luxury this year. However, Anthony returns to spearhead a revamped Trojan attack. Perhaps now the highest profile member of the roster, the former Maryland transfer was tied for first on the team with 10 goals last season. 
“Last year she transferred and there was still an adjustment period,” McAlpine said. “To have a 10-goal season in an adjustment year is pretty impressive. But I think now there’s a bit more familiarity, and as a senior [she’s] hungrier.” 
Three years after McAlpine arrived at USC, the women’s soccer program has now returned to the national spotlight. Unlike in the recent past, the team will no longer slip under the radar, as they enter this year ranked No. 3 in the nation in the preseason coaches’ poll. Despite the program’s new stature, its goals remain largely the same. 
“As much as we’d like to be champions, we set our sights on getting better every week,” McAlpine said. “And you want to be top three in the Pac-12 to give yourself a chance to be seeded in the NCAA Tournament and then make a run. We just try to get better every day and get to the small goals. And if we do enough of it, we’ll put ourselves in position at the end.”

Even after the summer break, the words “Austin-Morgan” still conjure up a feeling similar to “Hillary 2016;” it was written previously in this publication that the USG presidential race rocked an already election-sensitive campus. Past the doubled trauma of watching yet another inexperienced outsider go head-to-head with another surreptitiously deceptive heir-apparent, the most important distinction lies in the fact that Austin Dunn and Morgan Monahan actually won their race.
Competitions of the past and election trauma aside, it seemed that the lasting takeaway from the spring race was that there were very few students on this campus who had been able to track, or attempted to track, the success and progress of the Edwin-Austin administration. The Austin-Morgan ticket very wisely leaned on a laundry list of accomplishments or accomplishments-in-progress — many of which were initiatives trotted out during the election, but never mentioned prior. Thus, the key question becomes one of accountability and follow-through. Dunn and Monahan wanted it, and now they’ve got it. USG cannot be allowed, and cannot allow itself to once again disappear into obscurity until the next campaign cycle.
The Austin-Morgan ticket had a total of 35 different platform points over five separate categories. These included everything from an all-inclusive active-shooter preparedness program to the installation of speed bumps on the Row. Their victory made for a cheery Valentine’s Day, and since, radio silence from our freshly elected leaders. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation’s application cycle for speed-bump requests ended over the summer. While Dunn and Monahan posit the necessity of ice machines in residence halls, the floors of USC Village’s new residential colleges don’t even come equipped with water fountains. 
Still, a few points of their platform stand out as obvious priorities, and are the only platform points likely to get any real traction in the new administration. Tuition transparency, the famed and mysterious “fall break” and  improved DPS transparency were generally shared across the platforms of the three competing tickets, and stand as universal wins across all student groups. Any of the three would be a marvelous accomplishment on its own. However, whether senior administrators will actually enact any of these motions is subject to speculation. 
Taking tuition transparency as an example, the University’s M.O. seems to be to issue a bland statement about the most recent tuition hike without even the most basic attempt at an explanation. If education is to become a commodity purchased by the affluent to maintain their socioeconomic grip, it would seem this is a shoddy way to treat one’s customers. However, assuming we have become the customer, since rumored explanations for tuition hikes generally hover around “paying for things,” and, on a more abstract note, supply and demand. What things, the student body asks? The University leaves it up our imaginations. It is at this point that Dunn and Monahan should be outlining what they plan to do about it. Where is the detailed policy initiative of steps to be taken, actions and impact? In all likelihood, we won’t receive one — and worse than that, history shows that Dunn and Monahan will probably be left to triumph or fail in the din of another type of opacity: their own. 
Where is the dogged grit of our student journalists, and when will they turn their scrutiny toward student government? When will we discuss where that $2 million budget is going, or what these elected leaders are doing? Two years ago, former student body president Rini Sampath made her own waves, and drew her own thunder. Quieter administrations — like Edwin Saucedo’s — were allowed to fall quietly into the ether. 
Dunn and Monahan need to begin their administration with a commitment to transparency — and not just the glossy We-Did-It moments, but the real kind, the point-by-point plans, the updates, the messaging. Student groups committed to such transparency — our media outlets — must concentrate on the grit and detail of the administration’s progress, not just the general talking points of dull Senate meetings. Finally, the student body must recognize that there is no glory in doing any of these things, either for student government or student publications, if they are speaking to an audience that is not there to hear them. By voting in the last election, no matter the candidate supported, an investment was made in the success and vitality of our student government. Make good on that investment. Pay attention.

Last year, USA Today ranked USC as the third best college for women studying STEM, citing that the number of women in tenured faculty positions in the sciences has tripled at the University since 2000. But, as with the age-old growth versus proficiency debate in education, the gender ratio among STEM faculty at the University remains controversial — three times a relatively small number, after all, shouldn’t be celebrated as an end-game victory for promoting diversity and gender representation. 
According to the latest data provided by the University, two-thirds of faculty positions in STEM departments at USC are male. There are 296 female faculty members in the STEM fieldss compared to 598 male faculty members, and 15.1 percent of tenured STEM faculty are female while 84.9 percent are male. 
These figures matter for a number of reasons, and speak not only to USC’s broader future as an elite institution of higher education, but ultimately to the futures of generations of young women to come. 
Today, the gender wage gap persists despite the existence of modern laws meant to prevent it, largely because of cultural biases that can’t be legislated away. Much can be said of maternal leave policies that enforce gendered expectations and limit working women’s opportunities, as well as overt discrimination and sexist perceptions of who is more experienced and authoritative. 
But in the 21st century, as STEM fields have become some of the highest paying lines of work and the predominantly male industries have become a hotbed for sexism and even sexual harassment. With roughly two-thirds of women in STEM reporting harassment or assault in the workplace, it’s becoming clear that notable gender gaps in this field are contributing significantly to pay inequality. 
It would be ignorant to blame women for making the active choice to reject science. From a young age, girls are subliminally primed to follow other paths by ingrained cultural narratives, or are steered away from STEM simply because of the residue of sexism left from previous generations. For example, there are fewer female role models working in STEM jobs, with women comprising just 24 percent of the STEM workforce as of 2009, so it may be difficult for young women to picture themselves in this line of work. On the other hand, adolescent boys have no shortage of men working in STEM-related jobs to look up to and identify with.
Of course, none of this is to say that even if men and women equally comprised STEM jobs, wage inequality would vanish — 2016 research by Ohio State University has shown that even within STEM fields, the gender wage gap ranges from 11 to 30 percent. 
All of this is, frankly, just the tip of a metaphorical iceberg that doesn’t even begin to address another equally troubling cultural phenomenon: the trivialization and economic devaluation of femininized lines of work. Historically, teaching and nursing were once regarded as highly prestigious fields, only to be dismissed upon becoming female-dominated. 
But in either case, with a fresh school year comes a fresh start for USC, which is constantly marketing its diversity as a selling point to prospective students. That being said, the University certainly deserves recognition for its upward trajectory in terms of representing women more adequately in STEM faculty. Each woman who earns a tenured position in USC’s world-renowned science, technology, engineering or mathematics departments is another potential role model for young women, another potential speaker to inspire the female student body of a South L.A. elementary school, another potential mentor to a female USC student who could inspire her to challenge gendered barriers and go the extra mile in her studies. 
Female hires matter, especially in male-dominated fields like computer science and engineering, and rising high school seniors weighing their options in the months to come might feel more comfortable and supported at a university where they feel represented by the faculty. Recognizing the extent to which representation can be a deciding factor for prospective students could be central to attracting valuable female talent to the University’s class of 2022, and to classes in the years to come.
Still, at the end of the day, credit must be given where it’s due: There’s no denying that USC’s female students in STEM are leading the way in the fight for fairer representation and female involvement in STEM leadership positions. 
USC’s Association for Computing Machinery is currently led by a female president, and last year, AthenaHacks, a group created and led by female USC students, launched a hackathon that attracted more than 310 female high school, community college, undergraduate and graduate students across Los Angeles and yielded more than 60 submitted tech projects. According to the group, it was the largest all-female hackathon in Southern California, hosted right on USC’s campus.
Progress toward the representation of women in STEM at USC may be gradual, but don’t expect USC’s female student body to wait around. USC women are forging the path forward for female millennials, and in the years to come, the University and society at large will reap the benefits of this leadership.
USC should stand for Excellence in Hiring, hire the best and the brightest to teach the best and the brightest. This article runs counter to that, and promotes discrimination.
Kylie, are you majoring in a STEM field? If not, it’s kind of like watching a competitive runner run in the 5K, 10K or what have you, and because that person makes it seem easy, you think you can do it just as easily. Male, female, it doesn’t matter. STEM majors are weedouts. You wanna know why Marhsall is such a big undergrad business school, population wise?…yeah, about half them are FORMER STEM majors. If you look at other selective universities, their undergrad business school are only in the few hundreds population wise; Marhsall is 3K+. There’s a reason for that. I digress. But STEM is fricken hard, regardless of sex. Please research it more thoroughly if you don’t believe me.
Here’s a rational approach to hiring.  Bring in the most qualified persons – regardless of gender.   Now grow-up and cease the bigotry against men.

With the advent of the highly anticipated USC Village, it almost seems as if students are arriving at a new university: bigger and brighter than ever before, if not somewhat marred by recent revelations surrounding former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito. And yet, amid romps through the new Target and afternoons spent sampling the many new restaurants available, the traditional trappings of a new school year will remain the same. Students will move in, classes will commence and a new, nervous batch of freshmen will face the beginning of their careers as members of the Trojan Family — one with the shiniest facade in recent memory.
Appearance matters at USC. It’s clear through various construction projects, the pride with which the school speaks of its illustrious alumni and the volume of students rushing the Greek system each semester, that this has always been the case. Perhaps, it is at the beginning of each school year — when students meet new friends, settle into new routines and enroll in classes —  that appearance matters the most. And it’s also when the opportunities of a new school year should be most fully explored.
But for freshmen specifically, the beginning of the year is as much a time for scholarly development as it is for a more personal kind. As it is universally known, fall of freshman year is also when students begin to experiment with their own personal limits and grow independently as young adults. The freedom is enticing, but it can also be profoundly jarring, as it always is when young people are thrust into new surroundings and forced to adjust to life without the comforts or constraints of home. Without a doubt, where some students will thrive, others will need additional support. 
For these students — and everyone on campus — it is imperative to recognize and learn that underneath USC’s magnificent exterior extends a network of support, one that should not stay hidden until its resources are emotionally required. Long-term mental care extends beyond the occasional pop-up tents of puppies during midterms, the rounds of “Fight On” blasted through the walls of Leavey Library and a social media-friendly wellness dog named Beau. 
A healthy level of stress is expected in college and can prove beneficial for students to learn to manage in their early careers. But no one should be expected to handle stress alone, and it’s the prerogative of the University to make its resources known, especially at the beginning of the year when students’ emotions can grow turbulent. The Engemann Student Health Center provides individual counseling services and group therapy and maintains the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion, which dedicates itself to a holistic view of health beyond education.
Although being physically fit is beneficial, maintaining one’s mental health is fundamental to success in college. Every student is required to enter USC having taken online courses describing the physical dangers of alcohol abuse, but what’s harder to talk about is that a culture of binge drinking fosters individual cases of alcoholism — one that could be steeped in depression and anxiety. Even in less extreme situations, it’s still difficult to talk about homesickness, relationship issues, self-esteem and lowered self-confidence. The stigma associated with those who need mental support can be damaging and isolating, but every student must understand that the journey toward improved mental health and mindfulness is never something to be embarrassed about. 
Strong students become strong alumni, well-equipped to perform research and create work that benefits everyone. A beautiful facade means little if a network of support exists without students being aware of it — especially during a period as restless and tumultuous as freshman year. Rather than being an afterthought to students’ lifestyles, mental wellness is integral to building the path toward high achievement for both USC and its students. Outreach and education, on the part of the University, will ultimately make for a more productive and happier student body down the road.
Confirm that student unhappiness at USC is ubiquitous.  How’s about upgrading the admissions committee such that the emotionally fragile can be reliably identified, then demand that, upon admission, they must be actively supervised by a Snowflake Squad or a Grow-the Hell-Up Committee.
—The stigma associated with those who need mental support can be damaging and isolating???
“Associated with”? By whom? It is not a universal, it requires individual involvement. Please do not yourself say it is “associated with”.
Educate those who make that association, do not join them.

At the end of July, The New York Times published a report about the latest Department of Justice investigation. The report read like a work of satire: Attorney General Jeff Sessions will be looking into racial discrimination toward white college applicants as a result of affirmative action policies. According to the internal document obtained by the Times, the DOJ’s civil rights division is seeking lawyers interested in working on a project involving litigation related to race-based discrimination in college admissions.
The report comes roughly one year after Fisher v. University of Texas Austin, the landmark case that upheld the right of universities to consider race, ethnicity and cultural background in college decisions. The Supreme Court ruling additionally noted that race, contrary to widespread anti-affirmative action propaganda, is not a deciding factor in admissions.
The DOJ’s latest attempt to portray white students with subpar grades as martyrs of a diversity-driven American education system is frustrating and outright degrading to students of color by suggesting their achievements are a sham. But at a time when cries of “reverse racism” are becoming increasingly prevalent, it’s unsurprising.
Affirmative action is a complicated topic; it’s not meant to be a cure-all solution to systemic racism and economic inequity in the American education system, and frankly, it isn’t. The shortcomings of our national education system in addressing race, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic class and a host of other identity-based issues are barely touched upon by affirmative action.
Nonetheless, affirmative action is, if not perfect, necessary. In the absence of policies that allow educational institutions to consider and correct structural and intergenerational inequity, these institutions will almost certainly increase this inequity by allowing it to continue. Contrary to what the Department of Justice seems to believe, ignoring systemic inequity may be “equality” — but it certainly isn’t equity. 
Inequity, a lack of diversity perpetuated by an inability to recognize inequality, benefits no one — not the low-income minority students who grew up with fewer opportunities than their white counterparts, and certainly not the white students who will be denied the deeply enriching experience of learning and working in diverse settings. 
Notably, the DOJ’s efforts to curb this so-called discrimination also loops in a racial minority: Asian Americans. Shedding light on a 2015 complaint against Harvard University about race-based rejection voiced by a large coalition of Asian Americans, the DOJ now has a new, more diverse face for its agenda — one that points as if to say, “Look, this investigation is about everyone.” But the idea that some Asian American students may be denied admission to a university for no other reason than their race is, in the grand scope of the 2016 election and the first months of Donald Trump’s presidency, clearly not a priority for this administration. Any pretense otherwise is an affront to the vast and multicultural American student body.
Of course, Asian Americans experience significant privileges unique to their race. But they are excluded from Trump’s narrative of perceived white oppression, and the DOJ’s motivation is exactly that — not some spontaneous call to action for ubiquitous social justice. It’s a tactic as transparent as it is manipulative: It’s one of the most American pursuits to fight for equal opportunity and education for all. But to support Asian American students in their academic endeavors is fundamentally different from tearing down a system that has tried to leverage equal footing in education for minority students across the nation for decades.
“Colorblindness” is a game only the privileged can play: Young black boys who misbehave in the same way their white peers do face graver disciplinary actions in their schools as children. They grow up to be statistically far more likely to be singled out by police. It’s impossible for them to ignore the color of their skin. Similarly, Asian-American students who suffer from anxiety and other mental health disorders at higher than average rates, largely as a result of being held to standards dictated by the “model minority” stereotype can’t be “colorblind” either. And ultimately, the same could be said for every group except white people. 
At the heart of opposition to affirmative action is a sense of frustration toward universities for refusing to overlook the past — a past in which people bought and sold other human beings because of the color of their skin, a past strained with segregation, lynchings and systemic, race-based denial of meaningful opportunity. Institutions of higher learning will not ignore a present colored with targeted police brutality and intergenerational poverty. In this very real past and present, white students are not the victims but the beneficiaries of inequality. Through generations of enjoying implicit and, at times overt, advantages, the pursuit of equity has become misinterpreted by white affirmative action opponents as oppression.
At the end of the day, as for white people being denied opportunity for being white, Jeff Sessions need not look further than President Donald Trump’s cabinet — stocked with more white males than that of any other U.S. president since Ronald Reagan — for some stark evidence to the contrary.
For its own part, USC has vocally supported affirmative action for years, and boasts an impressively diverse student body. The University has its work cut out for it in terms of meeting the unique needs of this student body, but at the very least its admissions panel is able to recognize that white students are not victims of discrimination.
The authors of this article seem to fall into the same ignorant racist thinking that many liberals do when they broadly associate white people with money and privilege. There are so many poor white people who are tired of hearing they are born with privilege because of the color of their skin. Meanwhile they are scrapping by at similar poverty levels as any other group of people with more pigment in their skin. It is this ignorant broadbrushing of people base on skin color that got us elected a buffoon with cotton candy hair as POTUS. Poor to mid-income people constantly being told they are privileged because they are white thought they might as well elect someone who was not mindlessly chanting this liberal mantra. Keep it up people – you are just giving Trump a 2nd term.
Because they’re afraid that if they don’t fit in on the SJW bandwagon, that they’ll be ostracized. They got a herd mentality.
The author needs to understand USC never has had to rely upon AA to build its student body.  Given USC’s location in a traditionally diverse state, thousands of highly-qualified, underrepresented minorities have applied to and attended USC throughout the past several decades.  In fact, USC traditionally has attracted many underrepresented minorities with top scores, including those who were accepted to Ivy League-calibre schools.  The article might have more applicability to state-run schools, but throughout its history, AA has not been an issue at USC.
Your fundamental error is to believe that persons should be treated as members of a racial group instead of as individuals. If doing so is a valid approach, why would you complain about “young black boys who misbehave in the same way their white peers do face graver disciplinary actions in their schools as children?” I taught in a middle school in which every student was black. The difference in behavior was light years away from what I experienced teaching in a mostly white school. If treating people as members of groups is valid, why not treat the group that on average misbehaves the most with the most severe consequences? 
You seem to think that affirmative action is good for black students. It is not. They fail to graduate in numbers much greater than students who entered school without a preference. The ones who fail still have student debt but no degree. Why not insist that they go to schools for which they are academically and socially prepared? Perhaps they would not arrive only to find themselves inadequate, leading to a sense of being under attack. 
If you want real diversity, try admitting students who think differently from the progressive pack.
UCLA does not practice affirmative action and their undergraduate class is 26% white. 
USC does practice affirmative action and is 33% white. 
But remember kids eliminating affirmative action is all about helping whites and bringing up any other group is a distraction.
Ucla practices affirmative action. It’s a loophole called “holistic admissions.” USC does not use AA. Cheng and Cheung don’t know what they’re talking about.
I acknowledge that affirmative action is well-intentioned in that it seeks to overcome present and historic inequalities.  But I have to ask, why did nobody predict that whites would come to feel resentment?  It appears that Dr. King himself is the only person who actually thought this through to its logical conclusion.  It is all well and good that educators can pat themselves on the back because they are promoting the disadvantaged. But what is a well-qualified white applicant supposed to think when he is told he will receive less consideration because of the color of his skin?  Did you expect everyone to just smile and nod?  How did you think they would feel?

A running joke depicts USC as the “University of Spoiled Children,” but to others, those letters also stand for the “University of Serious Crime.” Drivers instinctively lock their doors in the area; students and parents pore through College Confidential forums anxiously reading tales of theft and crime and every day, at 9 p.m., the campus gates close to insulate the student body from the surrounding community. Nonetheless, beyond the campus’s imposing architecture and beneath outdated perceptions of the elite University, there lies a story of change and progress through the years.
Despite depictions of a vulnerable campus threatened by crime, USC has consistently failed to crack lists of the most dangerous college campuses that include UC’s and Ivy League schools. In 2015, USC students reported 41 sex offenses, 59 cases of robbery (including motor vehicle theft and burglary) and nine incidents of aggravated assault on or near the University Park Campus, according to the Department of Public Safety’s Annual Security Report.
In the same vein, despite a steady reduction in crime over the years, the high-profile tragedies that do strike rock the campus and reverberate through the greater community. Three years ago, graduate student Xinran Ji was beaten to death by three local teenagers, and just this year, a student murdered neuroscience professor Bosco Tjan. Over the past several months, USC football has also made national news, not for cases of sexual assault involving several players.
Over the years, USC has developed a security apparatus that employs Los Angeles Police Department officers, off-campus ambassadors and a public safety force with a fleet of vehicles. E-alerts warn students of imminent danger, and daily press releases detail crimes and threats. Security cameras track movement and run license plates through national databases, and in 2015, the University partnered with Uber to provide free rides to students from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. within a two-mile radius of campus to bring them home safely.
Even with enhanced security, other less visible and reported threats such as catcalling, bike theft and hate crimes, both on and off campus, still threaten students’ sense of safety in their own homes. And many question why the yellow jackets that patrol our neighborhoods are merely required to report crime, instead of helping to prevent it or intervening.
In light of the progress made with ongoing challenges and threats, Trojans play a part in securing ourselves, our campus and our community against dangers through increased vigilance, awareness, reporting and sharing the burden of public safety with the administration and security force.
The conversation surrounding public safety at USC parallels that of the national level, with misconceptions dominating a debate over surveillance in our student body and surrounding community. And despite years of progress, similar to the halving of crime in the United States over the past few decades, recent well-profiled crimes damper hope and necessitate a unified effort on all fronts.
Safety comprises the second building block of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and indeed, a secure campus is a prerequisite and a continued necessity for the development of both students and the University. However, we must not be weighed down by the past because as our efforts have proven, progress marches — and in this case — fights on.

This past summer, USC has been rocked by a number of scandals.
Allegations that a former Keck School of Medicine dean smoked meth, mingled with criminals and even hosted parties in his office during his tenure made national news. But the numerous sexual assault scandals involving USC students are arguably even more concerning, especially as the University attempts to sweep them under the rug.
At the end of July, the L.A. District Attorney’s Office announced it would no longer be pursuing charges against Armaan Premjee, a rising junior enrolled at USC who was charged with raping another USC student in a dorm room in Fluor Tower back in April. The following week, Matt Boermeester, a former USC football player who kicked the game-winning field goal of the 2017 Rose Bowl, was removed from the team after being suspended in February for a student code of conduct violation amid a Title IX investigation.
While circumstances in Boermeester’s case remain relatively murky, as the former kicker’s alleged victim and girlfriend has since come forward to deny claims that he physically assaulted her, the University’s treatment of Premjee, allowing him to return for the Fall 2017 semester, is troubling — especially as the U.S. Department of Education and Office of Civil Rights have become mired in controversy regarding campus sexual assault policy.
For some context, Judge Michael Pastor ruled there was not sufficient evidence to continue working on the case against Premjee at the end of last month after Premjee’s lawyer said he provided footage of Premjee’s alleged victim appearing to give consent when the two were standing outside a bar.
“There is no indication of any withdrawal of consent,” Pastor wrote in his ruling. “There is a very strong indication that the alleged victim in this case was the initiator of any conduct between the defendant and the alleged victim.”
This, of course, ignores that by law, consent can be withdrawn at any time, and there is no evidence that the alleged victim didn’t change her mind later that evening behind closed doors. Consent is both morally and legally not a one-time exchange. And in stating that the alleged victim initiated the encounter, Pastor is suggesting that consent can be given when individuals are intoxicated, which is, again, a morally and legally unacceptable stance.
USC can’t be held responsible for decisions made in county courts, but it speaks volumes that Premjee is still enrolled as a student, and that the University was unwilling to confirm to the Daily Trojan whether there is still an ongoing investigation of Premjee taking place within USC’s Title IX office. However, the University has since confirmed to The New York Times that an investigation is still underway, and Premjee could be expelled if USC’s Title IX office concludes that he is guilty.
USC’s treatment of Premjee’s case comes amid national debate over campus sexual assault survivors’ rights, and how to balance these with the rights of accused students. While Education Secretary Betsy DeVos met with sexual assault survivors and groups representing them last month, she also met with groups dedicated to dismissing, discrediting and even harassing survivors. These groups notoriously work to portray women as liars and men as the victims of an unfair system designed to strip them of their rights.
After these meetings, DeVos, who declined to make a statement about whether she would maintain Obama-era guidelines that support survivors at her January hearing, reportedly began considering rolling back a key part of these guidelines earlier this year.
Specifically, this guideline lowered the standard of evidence for survivors, and has always been controversial. But while false reporting does happen, the National Sexual Violence Resource Center estimates that these cases are not only rare, but are also as detrimental to real survivors as they are to falsely accused students by increasing doubt surrounding real cases.  Additionally, as Premjee’s case demonstrates so chillingly, the preponderance of evidence guideline was introduced for a reason — survivors lacking evidence that unquestionably proves their experiences are easily dismissed in the absence of the guideline. 
Crimes of a sexual nature don’t translate neatly into the prototypical “innocent until proven guilty” mold of our criminal justice system. However, the misogyny-laced national dialogue surrounding sexual assault has bred troubling ignorance about consent and an unhealthy obsession with requiring victims to have perfect narratives.
Post-traumatic stress disorder and fear of facing disbelief — due to how the survivor was dressed, how they were behaving in the moments leading up to the assault, their sexual histories and even the nature of their relationship with the alleged assailant — and a number of other factors that simply don’t exist in other crimes, all discourage survivors from coming forward immediately, if ever at all. These time lapses by nature weaken the evidence in the case. Lowering the standard of evidence for survivors isn’t some misandrist ploy to target the accused. Rather, it’s meant to support students who could otherwise be denied justice.
Circling back to the case involving Armaan Premjee, we’re seeing just how much institutions value narratives over the humanity of survivors. The footage provided by Premjee’s lawyer may prove the alleged victim’s narrative is flawed, but the only reason we sweepingly equate flawed narratives to vengeful, lying women is that our society operates within a rape culture.
This rape culture tells us that women who appear to flirt with their assailants, who wear revealing outfits, who have previously consented to sex, are all fundamentally dishonest; this rape culture tells us that they can’t be trusted, that they should be dismissed and punished because they don’t fit the mold of the perfect victim that is ultimately a patriarchal construct.
If the University chooses to allow Premjee to continue to attend USC, at the very least, it has an obligation to be transparent about this decision. On a federal level and at USC, raising the standard of evidence for survivors within a system that’s already stacked against them and giving the accused the benefit of the doubt over survivors, mark an unforgivable step backward.
Kylie Cheung is a sophomore majoring in journalism and political science. She is also the editorial director of the Daily Trojan. Her column,“You Do Uterus,” typically runs Thursdays.
Let’s clarify a few things regarding the “murky” Boermeester situation. He wasn’t removed from the team in July, he was expelled from school. Zoe Katz, his girlfriend and the “victim” didn’t “since come forward”, she has Ffrom the very beginning denied that anything took place at all. The school placed a gag order on her. She tweeted early on that she was the alleged victim and that nothing happened, and was threatened with expulsion herself. She has only gone public now because the kangaroo court has ruled.
There never was any abuse. It was a case of a men’s tennis player looking out a window, thinking they saw something. He went downstairs, and Zoe and Matt were fine. He then went back to his room and told his roommate, another tennis player. Who also went downstairs and saw Zoe and Matt, who were fine. A few days later he went home. He mentioned what happened to his father. Well, his father was the tennis coach at USC. He is considered a person of responsibility. He has to report anything and everything he hears, from what ever the source.
It was never, ever documented in any way. The male tennis player who thought he saw something out the window refused to cooperate with the investigation. Zoe Katz denied that Matt abusedd her then or ever. There were even video cameras covering the area, and they showed nothing.  Although the University delayed and delayed showing them the video, and only allow them to view it, not get a copy of it.
What was shown is what a star chamber looks like. I suggest you read the court filings, and the decision of the judge in granting the stay of expulsion. If you think the procedures that the University of Southern California followed is any kind of justice then I pity you. One of the fundamental rights is the ability to question and cross-examine an accuser. In this case, there was no accuser. The accuser was the University. How do you cross-examine the investigator for the University, who writes up their report, totally dismissing the “victims” account by saying that she was a battered woman under his control. With no evidence. You fight that.
We women ask for equal rights and equal pay but shirk away from equal responsibility and have no qualms being called “victims” or “survivors” when it suits us. In the case of Armaan Premjee, it is very clear that the girl not only initiated the hook up but also demanded consent from Premjee every step of the way. If you have not read the transcripts or sat through the 3 day hearing where the judge looked through every piece of documentation, you would not be making these false allegations. It is evident that your perception is very gender biased…. the girl texted him the next day “Dude, I hear we F*****”, is that really patriarchal construct? A girl gets drunk, gets a guy to her room and gives him full consent…but can’t remember anything the next morning…and he takes the full blame for this? His life has been hell for the past few months and people like you continue to torture him. For true equality, we women need to take responsibility for our actions and believe in true equality. If women can be victims, so can men. I don’t agree that men are superior in their emotional handling of rape allegations when women are the aggressors.
Kylie Cheung brutally raped me without my affirmative consent. Please expel my rapist! Thank you.
Well, if there is no proof that the woman was raped then the young man should still be allowed to study rather than having his life screwed up based on accusations.

Complete with stained glass windows, a collegiate gothic ceiling and cardinal and gold banners showcasing the Five Traits of a Trojan, the USC Village dining hall has been frequently compared to Hogwarts. However, Chef Nathan Martinez is trying to set it apart as an icon that stands on its own.
“We’d rather call it a cathedral for culinary masterpieces,” he said.

Located on the ground floor of the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Foundation Honors Hall, the new dining hall will align with the principles of USC’s Food Philosophy and the Menus of Change University Research Collaborative, which focuses on seasonal foods and plant-based dining, smaller portions of red meat and the reduction of salt and sugar. It will also have an emphasis on healthy foods, sustainable practices and a variety of food options.
“There’s different things in every station to give it that complete variety — to give it that feel that you’re getting some of the food from Parkside [Restaurant], some of the food from EVK, some of the food from old [Café] 84, and then some of the newer developments in the USC Village,” Martinez said. “Most of the stuff we try to do is not repetitive.”
The dining hall features a 42-item salad bar, a deli station where students can create their own sandwiches on artisan bread, and an Asian cuisine station with hot pot, gyoza, dim sum and moo shu wraps. For dessert, students can choose from sweet and savory crepes, gelato, cobbler, pastries and local, sustainable and organic hand fruits. However, the dining hall’s flagship feature is its plant-based station, according to Martinez. 
“Everything there is vegan, down to the breads and the offerings that we give,” he said. “My biggest thing on it is that it’s actually made for everybody to enjoy. I try to create flavors and profiles that anybody would want to eat on a regular basis, and not realize they’re eating plant-based at the same time.” 
Aside from healthy and sustainable food, the new dining hall aims to have a restaurant-like atmosphere that goes beyond collegiate dining, according to associate director for residential dining Erik Russell. The 8,000 square-foot space seats up to 450, and is prepared to serve 3,000 meals a day. 
“We’re really working on upgrading the food experience and dining experience as a whole,” he said. “It’s completely different than anything we’ve done … It’s a big step forward for us.” 
One of Martinez’s main focuses is to provide USC students with the highest quality of food possible.
“I don’t want to have subpar anything, because you guys deserve it,” he said. “You guys work just as hard as we do to get through classes. You guys deserve some of the best food out there.”
