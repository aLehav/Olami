In my two years at USC, I’ve always known that oil was an essential part of Los Angeles’ history and economy. The countless buildings named after oil tycoons Edward Doheny and J. Paul Getty serve as constant reminders that before the city was dominated by the entertainment industry, it was an oil town. 

But I had no idea how pervasive and dangerous the oil industry remains in today’s Los Angeles. The recognizable oil rigs — the ones that look like huge metal birds dipping their head toward the ground and back up — only represent a small percentage of oil extraction sites in the city. 
There over 1,071 active oil wells in the city of Los Angeles, 759 of which are within 1,500 feet of residential areas. Due to a history of discriminatory zoning, the majority of these dangerous neighborhood wells are functioning in South L.A., in close proximity to USC. But even though these low-profile processing sites are not as visually striking as their old-fashioned counterparts, they continue to impose themselves in the lives of Angelenos.
Oil extraction sites are extremely dangerous to the people who live near them, leaking gases and pollutants into homes, schools, hospitals and public spaces. Living near a development site can increase cancer risk and lead to conditions such as headaches, nausea and upper respiratory illness. There is also a constant risk of deadly accidents due to the use of harmful acids, toxic gases and explosive materials at these facilities. Noise pollution from gas compressors, drills and other heavy equipment can cause sleep issues and raise blood pressure, while long-term exposure to noise pollution can contribute to endocrine issues, diabetes and learning disabilities in children. 

Now that much of the easily accessible oil has been drawn out of the area, companies are turning to experimental, generally unregulated methods like acid stimulation and hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking.” These methods involve shooting a slurry of water and corrosive chemicals into the earth in order to drill into hard-to-reach areas, and can trigger frequent, violent earthquakes. They are so new that their health effects have yet to be formally studied, but anecdotal evidence indicates that residents living near fracked wells can develop chronic cases of coughing and wheezing, and that pregnant  women living near fracked wells are more than 30 percent more likely to give birth to a premature or high-risk baby. As oil extraction methods become more extreme and secretive, the surrounding neighborhoods — mostly low-income communities of color — become more at-risk. 
Many wells are hidden behind high retaining walls or inside windowless buildings that do not disrupt the look of the city, and as such can be difficult to spot. I was shocked to discover that there are 29 active wells clustered on the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Budlong Avenue, less than half a mile from campus and just feet away from neighboring homes. There is another oil field just north of Mount St. Mary’s College that was shut down by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2013 after hundreds of people, including an EPA administrator, were sickened by its fumes. Its parent company, AllenCo, is currently trying to reopen the operation. 
Currently, Los Angeles does not have any specific agency to oversee the oil industry or protect the 580,000 Angelenos who live within a quarter mile of an active oil well. Call me a cynic, but I cannot help but wonder how the response would differ if residents from a higher-income area were afflicted by the same issues. 
The University has repeatedly stated its intention to serve the surrounding community. It should use its influence in local politics to advocate for increased regulation of the oil industry in the city. After a century of environmental damage, it is now time to prioritize the health of citizens and get oil operations out of South L.A. This can be done by updating zoning laws — which have remained mostly untouched since the 1960s — requiring transparency from the industry and shutting down volatile drilling sites. Local authorities must also discourage companies from using experimental and extreme tactics such as fracking and acid stimulation through legal action. The voices of community groups like STAND L.A., which has been fighting neighborhood drilling in South L.A. since 2013, should be elevated. Emergency response plans for spills and explosions must be published, and the school should be more communicative about the oil wells near campus and the risks they pose. Oil drilling in Los Angeles is not a thing of the past, and we must take action to ensure that it is not a threat to our future.

A few generations ago, someone might have told you 1960 was the election year that got them into politics. We can count those watershed moments, the elections that changed something — 1968, 1980, 1992, 2000, 2008 — those transformative moments of economic hardship or cultural shift that penetrated typical Americans’ lives, even those purposefully or haplessly apolitical. We could consider for a moment that these shifts were the helm, and those elections, the tiller; and at a moment when the country took a sharper turn than before, those of us on the ship got thrown a little — for some, out of the picture, and others, into the fray.
So in a sense, we’re lucky to have had 2016, if only for its stellar ability to have galvanized millions of young people to begin thinking about the sway of other political tides, to consider for a moment the pivotal role they could play in a national election, or even a city council meeting. But even after the great national shock 2016 caused, complacency still exists, and still proves problematic. The midterm elections are just around the corner — and if change is to come, our generation must vote.
To become politicized in college seems to be a great American tradition. It seems to open our eyes to larger questions and remind young people that they are an integral part of something larger than themselves. For some, that’s enough. Politics is a natural outgrowth of the recognition that our entire lives are contingent upon the health of our democracy, and the quality of our policy. 
Voter turnout among young people has always been low, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. It’s up for debate whether most young people care, but it’s certainly no surprise that they don’t show up to the polls. This trend doesn’t incriminate millennials any more than other generations in history. The problem, of course, is that today’s politics are more polarized, more extreme and more anti-democratic than that experienced by any other generation in modern history. And thus, though it may not be preferable, we must — must — perform better than our parents did.
If the present administration’s deep and vitriolic attacks on our free press go unchecked, America’s future journalists may not find themselves with the same quality or availability of a platforms their predecessors enjoyed; and America’s future taxpayers may find that their right to a representative government is no longer a right after all. As funding for the arts and sciences get slashed, so too does the potential for our innovation and creativity to change lives, for our own domestic research to make monumental strides in human history.  
To turn out young people in the upcoming midterms and the elections afterward, we have to do our due diligence in ensuring that we and our peers understand that politics does not have to be a lifelong obsession, but must be an unquestionable duty to country. Voting cannot be about whether you “really care,” but should come down to whether you live here. It is an obligation, the price for admission to enjoying democratic benefits — legalism, liberty and civil rights among them. 
Some would argue that in order to increase millennial turnout we must somehow jump through hoop after hoop to guarantee we understand we “matter.” Well, to return to those watershed moments — if current events haven’t convinced you that politics makes a difference and that there is a difference to be made, nothing will. If you want your issues on the table and your voice heard, you must vote. Here is a reality of democracy: No campaign in history has catered to the needs of a demographic that doesn’t turn out to vote. If we want change, it’s on us.
Perhaps antithetical to our generational or cultural self obsession, voting is not an act purely about you, and something you do only if you are convinced the system thinks you’re special. During moments of historic change, people didn’t march because they felt “heard” — they showed up precisely because they didn’t. Civic engagement allows us to be cognizant of issues affecting our families, our fellow citizens, our marginalized communities and our nation. 
When November’s midterms roll around, don’t wait for someone to hand you a voice or come around to pander to you. Change must be made, and we can start now. We can break the cycle and we can build the kind of country we deserve. Let’s vote.

It’s fair to say that USC is dealing with a lot right now. Look at literally any other page of this issue and you will see a staggering number of stories and discussions on our scandal-ridden administration. As USC navigates the growing pains of a rising institution and attempts to reconcile with past mistakes, many students, staff and faculty are left wondering where they fit in as individuals and where the school’s priorities lie.
I was thinking about these same questions as I walked through USC Village a few days ago, when my deep train of thought was waylaid by a sign that shocked me more than any Board of Trustees announcement could. Across the way from Starbucks (no, not that Starbucks, or that one. The other one. No. 5, I think?), nestled between the Roski Eye Institute and BBCM was an empty storefront with a sign on the window reading “Abercrombie & Fitch, Coming Fall 2018.” 
I gasped. My Hydroflask clanged to the ground as a flood of repressed mid-2000s memories rushed back to me. The Westfield Capital mall. Boys sporting spiked hair and fauxhawks. The catalogue, inches thick, all black and white. Headache-inducing perfume mists. Slatted black windows and rows of neatly folded sweaters priced at $100. Every mean girl in my seventh grade class with the A&F logo emblazoned across their chests. 
Abercrombie & Fitch epitomizes everything terrible about my adolescence, and I was absolutely floored to see it here — on a campus I believed was a safe space. 
In hindsight, I was naive. I should have seen it coming. Realistically, USC and A&F are not so different from each other. In fact, the installation of an Abercrombie & Fitch store on our campus feels like a beautiful metaphor for USC’s faults, and the ways that it is trying to improve itself. Both rose to prominence in the world of sports and built up reputations as bastions of adolescent wealth and privilege. Both realized that change was necessary, and are currently striving to show themselves as polished and mature while dealing with a somewhat regrettable past.
David T. Abercrombie founded the first store in 1892, only 12 years after USC was established. The original shop sold hunting and fishing equipment, and was successful for a time, but fell into disrepair by the middle of the 20th century. It wasn’t until 1992 that Abercrombie & Fitch was revitalized, when Michael Jeffries was named CEO.
Jeffries created the A&F brand as we know it: the cool kid store, with an empire of preppy clothes worn low and tight and racy advertisements to match. The branding was straightforward and aggressive; Jeffries once referred to the brand as “the essence of privilege and casual luxury.” In reality, A&F was a symbol of exclusivity and conformity, two things that would have fit in well with the USC of the mid-20th century. During that time, the school hovered around a 70 percent acceptance rate and only made national rankings when the label “party school” was applied. But while the school started to turn the tide, recruiting award-winning researchers and rejuvenating stagnant academic programs, Abercrombie continued to falter.
A&F refused to sell items larger than a women’s size 10 until 2014 and was sued numerous times for discriminatory hiring practices. It flirted with controversy frequently, selling t-shirts with racist Asian caricatures in 2002 and thongs for preteen girls with overtly sexual slogans. It purposefully marketed itself as the brand for rich, attractive white teens who have nothing better to do than wear overpriced sweatpants and flip flops — not out of laziness, but to prove how effortlessly superior they are. By definition, it was the brand of spoiled children, and if one could travel back to McCarthy Quad in 2005, I am sure that they could not take three steps without seeing the iconic A&F logo. The values espoused by Abercrombie & Fitch were a perfect match for the USC of the past, the USC that we were trying to leave behind. Eventually, the company realized that they too had some growing up to do. While Abercrombie basked in the glory of plastic opulence in the 2000s, the bit got old by 2014. Consequently, Jeffries was forced out amid public criticism of the brand and its declining sales performance. 
Now, Abercrombie & Fitch is trying to clean up its image by toning down their use of obnoxious logos and trying to sell less to preppy high schoolers and more to young professionals. The new A&F collections are filled with neutral pieces that are intended more for a business meeting than a yacht party. Its advertising has matured a bit as well, maintaining the classic black and white palette while keeping the models fully clothed. 
So Abercrombie & Fitch is an institution trying to repair its image, masking its previous reputation as a shopping destination for spoiled rich kids. Simply put, it is trying to make the world forget about its mistakes and reevaluate its priorities as a brand in an effort to be more inclusive. It seems that A&F has seen a kindred spirit in USC, a school that, try as it might to dole out scholarships and focus on academic innovation, still has yet to fully shake its reputation as the “University of Spoiled Children.”
Now, as part of its rebranding efforts, A&F is opening stores adjacent to two college campuses, including USC. So we, as Trojans, must ask ourselves if we want to assist them in this mission. A&F is yet another overpriced retail location at USC Village, but it also, strangely,  shares a problem analogous to USC’s. It seems that both of our camps are trying to mature and grow, to be more serious than they once were and move past the missteps of their previous leadership. The opening an Abercrombie & Fitch on our campus is oddly poignant in how metaphorically on-the-nose it is, and though I do not see myself shopping there any time soon, I do feel like these two brands are in this together.

After decades of bold promises and massive fundraising efforts, USC’s academic success has finally begun to match the acclaim it has been striving toward: Civic engagement projects continue to tie USC closer to its immediate community while new programs and partnerships  connect the University to the rest of the country and the world. To top it off, USC Village opened its doors to the public just a year ago.
In the past decade, USC reached a $6 billion fundraising target 18 months ahead of schedule, dropped to a record-low 12.6 percent acceptance rate and was ranked No. 21 on the U.S. News & World Report college list. To this day, the University continues to double down on these commitments, launching and developing groundbreaking initiatives and pipeline programs from the Good Neighbors Campaign, which annually raises millions for local nonprofits, to the Neighborhood Academic Initiative, which boasts a 100 percent college acceptance rate for local, underserved students in its program. And during a time when elite institutions remain exclusionary for so many, USC has led the way by accepting more community college transfers than any other private university. Former president C. L. Max Nikias led the University during a critical era defined by unprecedented growth and development and achieved a number of the ambitious goals it set for itself — but now we find ourselves asking what the cost of all that was.
These impressive numbers and statistics cannot mask the innumerable controversies that have left the USC community feeling betrayed by an institution they call home. Especially as the cost of attendance continues to skyrocket — now exceeding $70,000 per year — and news of corruption and abuse at senior levels pervade the University, we as members of the Trojan Family have repeatedly paid the price. 
In the midst of these scandals, the national media and country joined us in a call for accountability and transparency from our administration while we struggle to fathom how our university could have knowingly endangered its students for so many years. The cover-ups that have rocked USC not only broke our trust and compromised our safety, but also revealed a culture that seems to prioritize damage control over prevention.
But after a tarnished president’s resignation, a changing of the guard in the Board of Trustees and many months under national scrutiny, USC desperately needs a president and a culture committed to transparency and prevention while remaining dedicated to preserving and expanding inclusivity on and off campus. Simply put, we need new moral leadership.
Interim president Wanda Austin must bear the needs and demands of the Trojan community in mind as she assumes her new role. Even if only temporarily, she must take students’ long-held grievances to heart rather than ignore them as past leaders have done. 
False promises and inherent contradictions must become a thing of the past. For example, when construction began on USC Village, a USC press release promised “a wide range of high-quality, affordable retail” and affirmed that “student customer price points and community member custom prices points are an extremely good match.” Yet when the fireworks of the grand opening ceremony dissipated, pricey eateries such as Greenleaf Gourmet Chopshop and Sunlife Organics emerged in a neighborhood where 47.3 percent of families with children in the University Park Campus area live in poverty and 24 percent of USC students are eligible for Pell Grants. And while USC opened a food pantry last semester, an untold number of students continue to struggle with food insecurity. 
We still struggle to escape the label of “University of Spoiled Children,” and despite recent progress, we must continue to tackle inequity and promote inclusion. Though one of seven Trojans in the entering class of 2022 are first generation college students, a New York Times report finds 63 percent of students come from the top 20 percent income bracket while only 4.9 percent come from the bottom 20 percent. USC is the largest private employer in Los Angeles County, recent union protests over the wages and benefits of subcontracted workers reveal tensions over workforce treatment and integration. Though the construction of the USC Village aimed to provide more University housing for students, community members continue to face eviction as developers seek to house more Trojans off campus. 
These challenges also persist on a federal level. The recently upheld travel ban impacts roughly 250 USC students. Undocumented students, staff and faculty still live in fear as they grapple with the threat of federally-mandated deportation. Higher education still reels from the recent tax bill, which threatened the pocketbooks and livelihoods of graduate students until just days before its passage in December 2017. These policies, as well as dangerous rhetoric coming from Washington, D.C., make the protection of our most marginalized students even more pressing.
Our new president must recognize that behind all these statistics are human lives. These pressing issues — the ones that students hold dear and have so valiantly fought for in the past year — must finally be addressed on deeper levels. 
At a time when USC has jeopardized the confidence and trust of its community and on a campus where false promises, damage control and lack of transparency have set back years of progress, 2018 marks a crucial turning point for the University. Throughout this crisis, our faculty stood with us, from the 200 professors who demanded Nikias’ resignation in late May to the almost 700 professors who raised concern that Nikias wasn’t leaving office in July. Their persistence and courage remind us what it means to be a Trojan. They encourage us to restore the USC known for diversity and innovation rather than the USC making national headlines for failing to protect its own students. And collectively, we expect our administration to hold itself to the same standards. The Trojan Family deserves nothing less and it’s high time we have a president who recognizes that.

When the U.S. Department of Education closed its investigation into USC’s handling of sexual assault cases in March, it seemed like a step forward. After the department concluded its five-year investigation, its Office for Civil Rights commended USC’s policy changes regarding sexual misconduct. But then the case was reopened after allegations against Engemann Student Health Center gynecologist George Tyndall surfaced in May. Its investigation was clearly not as thorough as intended, and completely missed or disregarded multiple allegations of sexual harassment. Somewhere in the process of transferring cases to federal authority, something was overlooked or hidden. This critical error subsequently reveals a deeper, systemic issue with how universities handle sexual misconduct. 
The Department of Education’s failure to notice the Tyndall allegations — despite five years of investigation — demonstrates the ultimate failure of our current system to properly investigate sexual misconduct cases, which puts too much power in the hands of the University. In order to properly evaluate sexual misconduct claims, an impartial third party must be brought in. 
Despite the initial investigation, which examined USC’s sexual misconduct cases from 2010 to 2015, allegations against Tyndall dating back to the 1990s never surfaced in the OCR report. Students had continuously filed complaints against Tyndall with medical staffers, and his colleagues reported his actions to Engemann executive director Lawrence Neinstein. Despite his knowledge of Tyndall’s alleged malpractice, Neinstein allowed Tyndall to remain in his position as the only full-time gynecologist at USC. 
This is not to say Neinstein took no action; the director did refer the complaints to the University’s Office of Equity and Diversity, which investigates sexual misconduct and racial and gender discrimination. OED executive director Gretchen Dahlinger Means dismissed the complaints, claiming there was no wrongdoing on Tyndall’s part. This is where the allegations against Tyndall appear to have been omitted from the initial OCR investigation, and because Means was also the school’s Title IX coordinator at the time, the case also slipped away from the University’s purview. 
The initial investigation missed complaints against Tyndall because it appeared there was nothing for USC to report in the first place. However, Tyndall’s financial payout and quiet resignation say otherwise. 
The administration’s pattern of allowing faculty misconduct to go unpunished must be stopped. The problem is that the Department of Education and OCR, which are supposed to prevent this mishandling in the first place, cannot even access most of the reported information. 
This systemic issue cannot be solved merely by the OCR’s second investigation. There is an urgent need for change in sexual misconduct reporting at universities. Schools must create a completely separate and independent entity to report, process and act on sexual assault cases. According to  Title IX, universities are required to prohibit gender discrimination —which includes sexual offenses — from occuring on campus. While universities must help by providing resources for victims, they should also provide counsel for the defendant. When the University investigates allegations against accused students, there can be grave academic consequences, but often little to no legal action taken against the perpetrator. 
If students report sexual misconduct to the police, those records would be clear and accessible, as they would be included in publicly available databases rather than in-house University records. More importantly, law enforcement would be required to pursue the case. Universities inherently have a desire to protect their own reputations, and it will always be difficult — even nearly impossible — to change this. If students reach out to both local police and the University when sexual misconduct occurs instead, the investigation and possible punishment could come from both the school and the legal system. This would allow victims to recieve the full support they need while also granting the accused a fair trial. 
Students want to feel safe and secure at USC. But their safety is threatened when perpetrators are allowed to remain on campus due to bureaucratic fumbles. The only way to truly ensure student safety is to encouarage them to advocate for themselves and their peers by taking their cases to legal authorities. In the end, students need to know they have the option to take legal action, and the University must actively encourage them to do so.

On Aug. 2, the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism announced it would temporarily suspend using “The Julie Chen/Leslie Moonves and CBS Media Center” as the official name for its media center. 
The decision comes after a report from The New Yorker, which details multiple allegations of sexual harassment from women who worked with CBS Corporation CEO Leslie Moonves from the 1980s to the late 2000s.
The decision was, of course, a smart one — especially for a university looking to repair its reputation after the Los Angeles Times released a bombshell investigation about the sexual misconduct of longtime Engemann Student Health Center gynecologist George Tyndall, and subsequently drove USC administrators to crisis mode. And yet, a closer examination of Moonves’ case begs the question: While it openly condemns the misconduct of public figures, does USC adequately prevent sexual harassment on its own campus? 
The simple answer to this question would be: No. At least, not yet.
The Annenberg school’s decision is nothing we haven’t seen before: Last December, the USC School of Cinematic Arts removed film director Bryan Singer’s name from its Division of Cinema & Media Studies after he faced allegations of sexual assault. And after The New York Times and The New Yorker published their findings on the infamous Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment cases last October, SCA rejected a $5 million donation from the media mogul. 
After the Weinstein story broke, a new wave of political correctness became ever more present in the policies of America’s public institutions. Particularly, USC’s open stance against sexual harassment is a no-brainer. Parents and students alike should sleep more easily knowing that the home of the Trojan Family is a safe, welcoming environment. And, of course, projecting the image of student safety and political progress is an essential task for any university looking to someday match the prestige of an Ivy League. 
But preserving reputation has proven to be a double-edged sword. 
Circling back to the Tyndall case, the Los Angeles Times has reported that complaints against the gynecologist date as far back as the 1990s — which means USC allegedly ignored student reports of sexual misconduct for decades. It was only after a nurse went to the campus rape center in 2016 that any substantial action was taken by the administration.
The case bears a few similarities to a scandal that erupted last October, in which a USC associate professor remained on staff after one of his students accused him of sexual harassment. In response, university faculty members penned a letter stating that they “simply cannot reconcile the limited sanctions imposed by the University.” 
And so, considering USC history, one can’t help but wonder if USC is only sorry that it got caught. In May, the Daily Trojan’s editorial board responded to the Tyndall allegations by joining the crowd of students and faculty urging former President C. L. Max Nikias to step down. Among several faults made by the University’s administration, the board argued that the proposal to add new departments overseeing ombuds services and professionalism and ethics would not only ignore the central demands made by past victims, students and professors, but also create more barriers to an already arduous process of sexual assault reporting. As a symbolic but ultimately necessary gesture, the Academic Senate addressed those central demands by passing a motion calling for Nikias’ resignation. 
USC’s eventual removal of Nikias — a fundraising powerhouse for the growing campus — was a tough decision, but the right one. And in the same vein, removing Moonves’ name from Annenberg’s media center was the right call, albeit on a much smaller scale. But now, USC must  shift the focus to where it should have been all along: the students. Blanket statements of apology and proposals of more bureaucracy will not regain students’ trust. Now more than ever, the University must answer cries of help from students rather than sweeping them under the rug. Now more than ever, the University needs to put its money where its mouth is and protect its students first and reputation second. 
Indeed, it goes without saying that USC is undergoing a crucial reevaluation period — one in which the University must weigh its values of trust and safety against a longstanding culture of power and privilege. But will USC actually make good on its promises to put students first?
Hopefully, it will. But we’ll have to wait and see.

It is not surprising to see scaffolding or tower cranes looming over USC’s red-brick campus during the summer. This is, after all, the “University of Summer Construction.” But while construction workers were busy replacing each eroding brick at Doheny Memorial Library, the University was doing some rebuilding of its own behind closed doors. 
Much has happened at USC in the 14 weeks students were on summer break. Just four days after commencement activities concluded, an investigative report by The Los Angeles Times sent shockwaves across the campus community — the fifth administrative scandal in less than a year. This time, allegations were made against George Tyndall, a former Engemann Student Health Center gynecologist accused of sexually abusing hundreds of female patients at the University since the 1990s. 
Hundreds of women came forward with their experiences and filed lawsuits against the University. Students, faculty and alumni stood together in solidarity and voiced their dissatisfaction with the senior administration’s handling of decades of alleged misconduct, as well as then-president C. L. Max Nikias’ leadership. Amid furor, a faculty petition and Academic Senate motion successfully called for his resignation. And most recently, the Board of Trustees named alumna and former Aerospace Corporation CEO Wanda Austin USC’s interim president as the University begins its search for a new leader. 
Suffice it to say now is a confusing, yet simultaneously fascinating time to be at USC. At this moment, USC faces a reckoning of its own — to rebuild the culture of its senior leadership, to re-establish the trust of its most valued stakeholders and to redefine its name in history. Brick by brick. In the Daily Trojan’s inaugural Fall 2018 issue, we spotlight the major changes USC is making in the aftermath of a reputational crisis that has left students and faculty disillusioned by the moral failures of senior administrators. And while the University looks to the future, it must also grapple with the implications of its turbulent past. 
Just as USC pursues reinvention, the Daily Trojan is also rebuilding itself as the premier source for daily campus news. This semester, we will continue to push toward digital reporting and new forms of storytelling. Beyond creating more videos to accompany stories, our multimedia team has been working hard to produce original podcasts, including “General Education” and “Rhythm & News” (both of which are now available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts). Expect striking visuals and more interactive digital elements with every story. Amid these exciting projects, we are also excited to showcase a new look for the Daily Trojan — both in print and online — in the coming months.
Now more than ever, student journalism is facing issues such as financial challenges and administrative opposition — ones that threaten our existence as an independent student press. However, the Daily Trojan remains steadfast in our commitment to telling impactful stories within our community and demanding transparency from those in power. We recognize the power we have — not only as journalists, but also as members of the USC community — to hold the University’s leaders accountable while also keeping our readers informed with groundbreaking, timely and accurate reporting. 
As Trojans, we are taught to fight on in the face of adversity. While some critics may argue that USC has already crumbled, I can proudly say that its foundation remains robust. 
And as the new school year commences, the Daily Trojan is prepared to play our pivotal role in rebuilding and further cementing our home — brick by brick.

With the new school year upon us, now is the time for transition and renovation. Action must be taken by the administration, faculty and, most crucially, the students.
Following riotous months of disgrace and uncertainty, USC enters the fall semester to news of former president C. L. Max Nikias’ resignation and interim president Wanda Austin’s appointment. 
When the Los Angeles Times’ investigation revealed despicable details about former Engemann Student Health Center gynecologist George Tyndall’s predatory misconduct toward female students, the Daily Trojan Editorial Board professed that “what USC needs is to rebuild its culture from the ground up.” Last week, the Board of Trustees finally took steps to do just that. 
The Board’s decision to replace Nikias with the University’s first female and first black president demonstrates a striking shift from the tainted reputation it hopes to part with and a commitment to reforming its corrupted leadership. But this power can no longer rest solely in the hands of senior administration. Ultimately, the University’s culture is dictated and exemplified by and through its students. 
To that end, it’s high time we reclaim the USC we fell in love with and chose to make our alma maters. For months, our campus had been repeatedly rocked by scandal after scandal implicating University staff — from revelations of former Keck School of Medicine dean Carmen Puliafito’s drug abuse and assistant basketball coach Tony Bland’s bribery arrest, to Keck dean Rohit Varma and Vice President of Fundraising David Carrera both being ousted due to sexual harassment allegations. 
Months before that, the 
campus was beleaguered by unrest stemming from the University’s aggressively ambitious expansion project in the USC Village and its blatant disregard for the local communities it uprooted as a direct result. Regrettably, it has become increasingly difficult to remember a time when USC truly reflected the greatness it outwardly projects, or exemplified the ideals that attracted many of us to attend in the first place. 
It is all too easy to feel helpless in a community as large and powerful as USC, especially when those at the helm are steering in the wrong direction. But if this turbulent year has taught us anything, it’s that USC’s students hold immeasurable power in their ideas and actions. As evidenced by the consolidated efforts taken this summer to voice exasperation with the administration’s shortcomings and demand improvement, what students feel, desire and do can be extremely influential. 
During this time of transition, it is all the more important that students make their voices heard and demand transparency on the part of the administration. Periods of instability are often the most conducive to effecting change, and as the University shows its intention to improve, it is critical that students raise their voices, offer ideas and play an active role in doing so. On an interpersonal level, it is important for students to support each other and practice unity as a community. These are stressful times for many, and a little bit of kindness and patience go a long way.
Waiting for the Board of Trustees and senior administration to make a decision is frustrating and makes students feel powerless, but it is important to remember that we are anything but. USC is more than a brand desperately trying to save face or a ranking constantly striving to be elevated — it is made up of hardworking, brave and bright people who have the power to restore the community to the status they know it can hold.
As we make our way through this difficult period, it is crucial that we as students do not lose hope and that we remain vigilant and resilient in the face of adversity. We should take steps to protect the safety and interests of our fellow Trojans, and take the time to really listen to each other’s concerns. Consequently, we should continue making unified efforts to relay our qualms to USC’s leaders. The toxic culture that we are striving to fix is a result of systemic and cultural failures, and now is the time for us to alter the environment that enabled such behaviors. After this summer, we cannot afford to underestimate the power that the USC community holds, and we students must use that power to enact the positive change we seek.

The Keck School of Medicine of USC has announced the launch of an initiative called RESPOND, a new research study on prostate cancer among men of African descent.
RESPOND will examine the underlying factors, including genetics and social stressors, that contribute to higher risk of prostate cancer development among African American men. The National Institute of Health will fund 96 percent of the study, with the Prostate Cancer Foundation funding the other 4 percent. The grant for the study totals $26.5 million altogether. 
African American men are twice as likely to develop lethal forms of prostate cancer, but medical experts aren’t quite sure why, according to Christopher Haiman, RESPOND’s principal investigator and professor of preventive medicine at Keck.
Haiman is one of six researchers from USC on the RESPOND team, alongside Ann Hamilton, David Conti, David Craig, John Carpten and William Gauderman. Twelve other institutions are also participating in the study, including Emory University, Johns Hopkins University, Baylor College of Medicine and the University of California, San Francisco.
“It’s a health disparity that needs to be addressed,” Haiman said, according to a press release. “Considerable money, time and effort has gone into studies in men of European ancestry; it is time for a large-scale effort devoted to men of African ancestry.”
Starting in September, researchers hope to recruit 10,000 African American men with prostate cancer over the next five years. Participants will be asked to complete a survey, provide a saliva sample and allow researchers to access to tumor tissue. The survey will largely consist of questions regarding social stressors in the participants’ daily lives such as education level, socioeconomic status and discrimination. 
According to the press release, researchers hope to determine whether stress plays a role in the development and severity of this type of cancer. The findings of this study will also support more effective methods of preventing and treating the disease in African American men. 
“We plan to look at variations in DNA that are associated with prostate cancer overall and, more importantly, for aggressive forms of prostate cancer that are lethal,” Haiman said in the press release. “These genetic markers will ultimately help us to identify men in future generations who are at high and low risk for prostate cancer.”

Ground Zero Performance Café will no longer be serving their own food and drinks because it does not have the proper credentials. However, the space may sell pre-packaged items, according to Trojan Events Services. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Ground Zero Performance Café will reopen this semester — but primarily as a study space.
The longtime student-run establishment, once known for its milkshakes and performances, will return after a year of renovations, according to the facility’s new management Trojan Events Services. 
Milkshakes and coffee will no longer be made in-house, but performances and events like open mic nights and improv shows will be reinstated in the space.
TES said the space did not have the proper credentials to make fresh food, so it will instead consider selling pre-packaged food and drink. 
Over the summer, a petition circulated online among students and alumni pleading the University to reopen the cafe in the fall.
“The purpose was to help the University realize how much Ground Zero meant to not even just the people who worked there but the student body in general,” said Moriah Polk, a junior majoring in communication, who worked as one of the cafe’s house managers at the cafe. “Sometimes [USC forgets] that we want something student-run and very comforting rather than something that is so grand.”
Production manager Syann Cromwell, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law and African American studies, noted that the space was intended to be an environment for students to congregate and relax while studying. 
“[Ground Zero was a] free space [and] a unique environment on campus for students to hang out, enjoy milkshakes, enjoy live performances,” Cromwell said. “Just a different kind of vibe that wasn’t on campus before.”
While the space will be open in the fall, Polk said that she will miss serving culinary staples that allowed her to interact with customers in a student-oriented venue.
 “It ultimately is a tragedy that we can’t sell food or milkshakes anymore,” Polk said. “I know what drew so many people to Ground Zero and drew people back years after they graduated. I know that it is a memory that we all shared together.”
Many employees agreed that the food and drink fostered a welcoming environment for students. House manager Kiera Salvo, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, shared how the space exuded friendliness. 
“I think for me, USC’s campus, especially the places you can go between classes if you are going to stay on campus and you just grab coffee or food, it has all felt pretty sterile to me,” Salvo said. “Ground Zero was always a place where you didn’t have to do that. You could just sit there and talk to your friends, listen to the music that we were playing or just be sitting and studying and on a grind.”
Despite the changes coming to the space, Cromwell expressed how she and the other employees plan to work together to re-establish Ground Zero as a gathering space for students again this semester.

In addition to their project in Tijuana, JOVRNALISM met with community members providing deportees with basic necessities, counseling, Spanish language lessons and religious guidance. Photo courtesy of Robert Hernandez.
Students in journalism professor Robert Hernandez’s virtual reality class witnessed a transnational conversation during their summer trip to Tijuana reporting on the United States-Mexico border.
Using a split screen, the group of students filmed an American woman named Destinee in the U.S. and her father, who now lives in Tijuana after being deported. 
The students traveled to the border as part of Hernandez’s “Hands on Disruption: Experimenting with Emerging Technologies” course offered by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. In Tijuana, Mexico, the students reported on deportees and the communities established to support them. The JOVRNALISM team, as the group is dubbed, documented the stories in 360-degree video and created a five-part series called “The Deported,” which was released over the summer. 
The team spoke to deportees and their families, as well as religious and charitable services designed to aid their transition into life in a new and often unfamiliar nation.
“We were hunting for being trapped in the ‘in between,’” Hernandez said. “You’ve been kicked out of a country that you know and that you identify with because they don’t think you’re a citizen, and you’re in a country where you have no history and they’re looking at you as an outsider.”
The group partnered with KCRW reporter Jenny Hamel and KCRW digital editor Caitlin Shamberg, who helped the group publish their work.
The videos were recorded in 360 degrees and can be viewed two dimensionally on a screen or in virtual reality with a headset.
“Being able to immerse yourself in this place that we read about a lot and … explore what it feels like to be amidst these crowds who are hoping to get asylum into the U.S. or to be inside a shelter that’s really just tents on the concrete ground, you get a different type of immersive experience that can hopefully build empathy for these stories,” Shamberg said.
Hernandez’s class is student-led; students enjoy independence when it comes to pitching and voting on ideas, conducting interviews and filming and editing videos. Since there is no prerequisite, the course attracts both undergraduate and graduate students of various backgrounds and levels of experience with film and journalism.
“We are learning a lot of things at the same time, so a lot of these folks have never done journalism,” Hernandez said. “[We’re] learning by doing. We aim for a goal and, in a hackathon, you get what you get, and I think what we got was really beautiful.”
Helen Arase, who graduated from USC last spring, said Hernandez’s course taught her how to work spontaneously, rather than rely on a structured schedule.
“The value of the class is so much more than just the story you get out of it at the end,” Arase said. “The way we looked at these people’s stories is different than how I would have done it before the semester.”
Hernandez said he believes that new technologies like 360-degree video and virtual reality are the future of media and that it is crucial for journalists to become adept at using them.
“Why wait before [virtual reality and other new technologies] become mainstream?” Hernandez said. “Why don’t we get ahead of the curve and not only lead this disruption but also shape it so the ethics and values that I have as a journalist are baked into that?”

Drawing inspiration from his life experiences, Ernest Pund hopes to pursue storytelling through film. Photo courtesy of Ernest Pund.
For junior transfer student Ernest Pund, film is about more than storytelling alone. 
Pund believes film is a medium that touches and resonates with audiences even after the credits roll. As an aspiring filmmaker in what he calls an “age of dwindling attention spans,” Pund hopes to produce creative content that provokes thought and contains a call to action for his viewers. 
He sees the rigid doctrines that most Hollywood blockbusters adhere to as a flaw that limits the creative expression of individual filmmakers. 
“I believe in the inscription on USC’s cinematic arts building: ‘Limes regiones rerum.’ ‘Reality ends here,’” Pund said. “Never feel restricted in what you make. Film is a medium with infinite possibilities … Navigating this relationship between reality and illusion is key to finding a voice as a filmmaker.”
Pund, who was among 10 students to receive the Storytellers Scholarship from camera company Nikon this year, draws inspiration for his films from his own life.
His scholarship submission, a horror-thriller short film titled “Sarah Sleeps,” was inspired by his friend’s struggle with self-harm and eventual suicide. The film follows a young woman trapped in a recurring nightmare with an obscure monster who murders her repeatedly.
“[The film] was both a meditation and cathartic experience for me when I dealt with depression and sadness,” said Pund, who is majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production. “Every time the monster kills her, she wakes up again to receive the same fate, in a cycle of destruction paralleling what my friends endured.”
Joe McNally, who judged  the scholarships and serves as USC’s Nikon ambassador said that Nikon was impressed by Pund’s vision of suspense, darkness and ambiguity, a combination that piques viewers’ curiosity about how the story unravels. 
“For a submission to grab the eyeballs and attention of the viewer is a tall order,” McNally said. “Emotional involvement in the story is key to that. [Pund] is also confident at camera, and mixes up his camera angles, works entire to detail, throws in an interesting mix up of color palette, and directs his talent with assurance of a good director. He gets the viewer involved and guessing what might happen next.”
Pund said the $10,000 scholarship award will not only contribute to his tuition and film equipment, but also allow him to pursue his dream of becoming a filmmaker who defies the boundaries of both reality and fantasy. 
“While the financial aspect of winning the scholarship is important, I entered mainly as a way of testing myself,” he said. “I grew up shooting little movies on Nikon DSLRs. I wanted the challenge to show my work to a company that has been dear to me.”

After working at Apple Records, Trudy Green decided to shift her goals from fashion to music. Photo courtesy of Trudy Green.
This fall, the USC Thornton School of Music welcomes two new hires from the Los Angeles music business to its music industry program as associate professors: music manager Trudy Green and event producer Kevin Lyman. 
Despite having more than 40 years of industry experience managing clients including The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson and Aerosmith, Green never planned to work in the music industry.
“Nothing ever made me think about anything to do with being in music,” said Green, who studied business at Queen’s College. “I always wanted to be the fashion editor of Vogue magazine. I wanted to be Anna Wintour.”
Lyman, best known for founding the Vans Warped Tour and revolutionizing event promotion, got his start in live production by organizing events to raise money for his school’s ski team when he was a student at California Polytechnic University, Pomona.
Lyman has spent 24 years producing Vans Warped Tour, a “punk rock summer camp” that has featured artists such as Eminem, Blink-182 and Katy Perry. After completing the festival’s final year in August, Lyman is ready to pass on his knowledge to the next generation of event producers and create long term relationships and impact on students.
“With [the Vans] Warped Tour we sell over 550,000 tickets, and I have contact with people for very short-term bases out here,” Lyman said. “[As] a Trojan Family member teacher, I get to spend 15 weeks in the class with people really digging deep and help them find their way.”
Green fell in love with USC when her son attended the University but it wasn’t until she got a call from a Thornton adjunct professor and friend that she became excited about joining the school as a professor. 
“Now I have the job,” Green said. “Like everything in my life, it wasn’t planned.”
Since he was in college, Kevin Lyman has been involved in live production, and will continue to work with event producers at USC Thornton. Photo courtesy of Lisa Johnson.
Green became involved with the music industry after her initial job in public relations in fashion led her to work at Apple Records — a job that was supposed to be temporary while she searched for an opportunity in fashion. When she was eventually offered a fashion position, she turned it down.
“You’ve got to love what you do, and you won’t know until you test it out,” Green said. “I didn’t know I loved management until I tried it out. I’ve done all the record company stuff. That wasn’t something I wanted to do.”
Green went on to work for Crunch promotions, Fly Records, Gibson and Stromberg and founded her own company, Trudy Management Group. This fall, she will teach a master’s class on live touring in addition to two undergraduate courses. 
Both Green and Lyman are joining the music industry program to prepare students for what they call a rapidly evolving music industry. Thornton dean Robert Cutietta says their impressive careers and experience are a good fit for the Trojan Family.
“We are thrilled to welcome Trudy and Kevin to the USC Thornton faculty,” Cutietta said in a Thornton press release. “They are both unquestioned leaders in their fields, and their expertise will be an incredible addition to the Music Industry program.”

Leading the renovation · Alumna, trustee and former CEO of The Aerospace Corporation Wanda Austin will serve as interim president following C. L. Max Nikias’ departure. (Daily Trojan file photo)
Dr. Wanda Austin is not a president who wants to lead from behind a desk. She wants to make sure that everyone on her team is heard, and that she continues to learn from those who surround her. 
On Friday, in her first interview as interim president of USC, Austin spoke with the Daily Trojan at the conference table in her new office, rather than from behind her desk. 
The office she now occupies — at least until the University finds a new president — is located within the brick walls of the Bovard Administration Building. This space is where USC’s most prominent leader holds court over a university with nearly 45,000 students, an expanding alumni network of 375,000 members and an endowment of over $5 billion. 
The inconspicuous chair behind the desk in her office is one of the most powerful seats in Los Angeles — a seat previously held by Southern California behemoths like the late Steven B. Sample and C. L. Max Nikias, who announced his resignation just a few months ago.
But on the day of the interview, Austin’s office was a blank canvas, devoid of any signs that Nikias, who held the presidency for eight years prior, had ever inhabited the venerated space. 
There were no traces of the trustee-turned-president, either — the shelves of the bookcase towering behind the imposing wooden desk were barren, the desk bearing not so much as a nameplate identifying USC’s new leader, a woman representative of countless firsts. Perhaps there’s an explanation for the hollowness of the room; Austin only intends to serve temporarily. She says she has asked the board not to consider her for the permanent position, and wants to focus on how she can help revitalize the school during her brief tenure.
The only thing in front of Austin during the interview was a Fiji water bottle and her propped-up iPad, which buzzed sporadically throughout the 40-minute conversation.
Austin ponders and responds to questions with sincerity. She says she is a confident leader, though not a natural-born one. “Leadership is not a birthright; it is a skill,” she wrote in her book
“Making Space: Strategic Leadership for a Complex World.”
On Aug. 8, the University’s Board of Trustees appointed Austin to temporarily lead USC as it searches for Nikias’ official replacement, whose ousting followed inexorable outcry from alumni, students and faculty for what they believe was poor handling of the sexual misconduct allegations leveled against campus gynecologist George Tyndall over decades. 
From this storied office on the first floor of Bovard — markedly spotless and vacant as the University’s uncertain future — Austin is ready to move forward and help the community heal from the calamitous year it has experienced.
 
A lifetime of firsts
Austin’s appointment is a momentous first in USC’s complex history. She doesn’t look like any of the presidents who have come before her. As a matter of fact, all 11 of her predecessors were men — more specifically, white men.
However, she remains unfazed by the prospect of following in their footsteps. As a businesswoman and aerospace engineer, she naturally exudes authority and wisdom in her new role. Being a black woman heading a large enterprise isn’t new to her; she served as president and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation from 2008 to 2016. In an industry which, like higher education administration, is dominated by white men, Austin climbed the ranks of the company and was often the only person of color in the room. 
She’s no stranger to this. In fact, she said becoming both the first woman and first person of color to be named president of the University was not the first thought that crossed her mind when she accepted the role. Though she admits she may be considered a role model for being such, she thinks “it’s very difficult to say ‘you represent a faction.’”
Austin was raised in a predominantly black area in The Bronx, and attended a recently integrated school in an all-white neighborhood — three entire bus trips away. 
“There [were] a lot of things you could screw up, but you could not bring home bad grades,” Austin said of her upbringing. “[My parents] really worked hard for us to recognize that there was more than that inner-city block, and that we were exposed to that.” 
The clear separation between black and white students became even more evident when she left for Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and was one of  only 20 black students in a school of nearly 2,000. 
“Talk about making adjustments,” she laughs. 
She went on to receive a master’s degree at the University of Pittsburgh, followed by a doctorate in systems engineering from USC.
While serving as president of The Aerospace Corporation, Austin received numerous awards and was even selected by then-President Barack Obama to serve on the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, an experience that inspired her leadership philosophy. 
She’s served on various advisory councils, including those of National Geographic and NASA. Most recently, she was on the governing boards of both the Space Foundation and USC before assuming the role of interim president. 
 
The legacy she inherited
When asked if the University’s tumultuous year deterred her from accepting the position, her response was immediate and emphatic: “No.”
It’s easy to retrospectively regard USC as a series of unflattering headlines — “The secret life of a USC med school dean,” “Former students recount decades of disturbing behavior by USC gynecologist.” But beyond the critical language plastered across front pages, Austin says USC has been on the rise in ways that have gone largely unnoticed in the past year.
The past eight years under Nikias’ leadership saw the creation of two new schools, the construction of USC Village and the introduction of several new buildings to the University Park Campus. The University’s acceptance rate also dropped to record-low 13 percent.
“A lot of great things happened under Nikias’ great leadership,” Austin said, adding that the next president would push further in those goals. “We’re ranked 15th in the nation. I think that’s something we’re very proud of.” 
However, Austin admits that the way USC responded to sexual misconduct allegations could have been better. “Communication,” she answered after being asked what went wrong with Nikias’ handling of the past year.
Much of the clamor regarding the sexual abuse allegations at the University erupted following reports from the Los Angeles Times; before the paper broke the stories, the University had not publicly divulged any information about staff members’ alleged misconduct, since “silence doesn’t mean that nothing is happening,” Austin says. 
 
Fixing a broken system

Austin declined to comment on whether she supported Nikias’ resignation, since her opinion isn’t “something that needs to be shared publicly.” However, she did say that she never actively sought out the role of interim president.
“What I said was, ‘I’m happy to help,’” she said she told the board. “If there’s something that I can do [then] I would be willing to help.”
Now that she has the position, Austin says that one of the first priorities of her presidency is to engage with small community groups and ensure that their voices are heard, even if they don’t have a direct seat at the trustee table.
She wants to be a collaborative leader, one who not only listens but actually hears every person who speaks. She noted how inspiring Obama’s style of being focused and engaged — no matter who he was talking to or what he was talking about — was for her, as well as how much serving under him informed her own leadership philosophy.
“You have to learn,” Austin says. “You have to take the time to get the benefit of your team, to make sure you’re engaging them so that you can make decisions that give you the best chance at a positive outcome.”
Austin added that all of her posts, especially those at The Aerospace Corporation, have prepared her for the position she holds today, despite her lack of prior experience in academia. Indeed, the most valuable lessons she’s learned have come from other leaders. 
“I’m a leader that is willing to steal the best ideas from anyone,” she said. “Everyday, I learn something from someone — and it doesn’t have to be someone who’s got leader in their title. It can be a student. It can be someone who says, ‘Hey this is something I saw, something I learned, something I did that worked.’ I’m just always open to that and I get energized by that because when you stop learning, the lights are dimming and that’s not good.”

Austin wants the first months of her presidency to be a period of healing and rebuilding. 
“I’m going to work hard to make sure that our faculty and staff feel like they have the resources and the focus and the attention of the administration so that they are unhindered from being able to deliver their best performance every day,” Austin said.
To conclude the interview, Austin extended a firm handshake — a fitting emblem of the leadership philosophy she espouses and cooperative environment she intends to foster as president.

Among the Trojans · Former President C. L. Max Nikias’ presence at the University will endures as he assumes the role of President Emeritus and Life Trustee. (Daily Trojan file photo)
During his inaugural address in 2010, C. L. Max Nikias made a bold promise to USC: “My own commitment to you is to run the next marathon at a sprinter’s pace.” These words marked the beginning of a rocky eight-year presidential run — one defined by astronomical growth and plagued by scandal.
Nikias agreed to resign in May 2018 after faculty, students and alumni circulating various petitions demanding he be ousted from his corner office in Bovard Administration Building. The petitions largely began after sexual abuse allegations against former Engemann Student Health Center gynecologist George Tyndall surfaced in a Los Angeles Times report. This marked the end of a year in which Nikias’ presidency withstood and eventually fell to unprecedented outrage.
“President Nikias gave up many years of service to the University,” Gould School of Law professor Ariela Gross said. “[His resignation] is currently not about his personal qualities or his personal culpabilities. This is about a great leader taking responsibility for the things that happened on his watch.”
 
The final stumble in Nikias’ race
Tyndall, who worked at the health center for nearly 30 years, is accused of inappropriately touching patients during pelvic examinations, among other allegations of misconduct. The Times reported that said allegations dated as far back as the 1990s and continued until he was quietly removed in 2017. Since the report surfaced, more than 500 women have come forward with allegations against the doctor, many filing lawsuits against the University and doctor with renowned lawyers blaming USC for ignoring and downplaying Tyndall’s alleged actions.
Several hours before the initial Times report was published, Nikias sent a three-page letter to the community, but divulged no plans regarding his upcoming resignation. He stated that the University “should have made this report eight months earlier when [Tyndall] separated from the University,” but that his administration was “finalizing a comprehensive action plan in which the entire university community will work together to build a foundation based on respect, care, and ethical behavior.”
Less than two weeks later, as national headlines were inundated with hundreds more allegations and demands for University accountability, Nikias agreed to resign.
In many ways, the Tyndall report was the last nail in Nikias’ coffin, but it was far from the first time his moral authority to lead was questioned.
In July 2017, the Times released a bombshell report exposing former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito’s illicit drug use and double life.  
“One individual and his actions, in no way, reflect our core values, nor define who we are as a university,” Nikias wrote in a letter to the community following the Times investigation on Puliafito, who Nikias said had multiple behavioral complaints against him during his deanship.
Three months later, Puliafito’s successor Rohit Varma also resigned after the Times discovered  USC had quietly reached a settlement deal with a student researcher who accused the then-professor of sexual harassment. Varma served as dean for less than a year.
He was the first of three high-profile USC employees to either leave their posts or go on administrative leave for sexual abuse allegations over the span of the next month. The other two were Erick Guerrero, a professor at the School of Social Work, and David Carrera, the University’s vice president of fundraising.
“We do not tolerate behavior that violates our strict policy and take appropriate disciplinary action when it does,” Gretchen Dahlinger Means, the executive director of the Office of Equity and Diversity, told the Daily Trojan last October.
The scandals also bled from academics to athletics when former men’s basketball assistant coach Tony Bland was indicted by federal authorities on fraud and corruption charges in a scandal involving bribes offered to student-athletes.
“We are still learning the facts of this matter, but these allegations, if true, are profoundly upsetting to me,” Pac-12 Conference commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement in September.

The legacy he hoped to leave behind
One of the last triumphs of Nikias’ presidency was the opening of USC Village in August 2017. Its opening marked the beginning of his final year as president, a period characterized by soaring achievements and critical lows. 
Puliafito’s legacy continued to loom over Trojans as they arrived on campus and witnessed the ribbon-cutting in a ceremony the L.A. Times described as “Disneyland meets Hogwarts.”
The $700-million complex became the largest redevelopment project in South L.A., providing additional housing for over 2,500 students and mixed-use spaces for the surrounding community.  
“We built this village to show our enduring commitment to our exceptional students and our beloved neighbors,” he said at the village’s opening ceremony.
USC Village was a byproduct of the “sprinter’s race” mentality Nikias had when he set a goal in 2011 to raise $6 billion for the University by 2019. The feat was daunting — it had never been done at USC, and had only been achieved by a handful of the most prestigious universities — but he reached it. Eighteen months ahead of schedule. 
Upon the fulfillment of Nikias’ fundraising goal — perhaps at the pinnacle of his presidency — the Daily Trojan profiled Nikias and dubbed him the “Six Billion Dollar Man.” 
Before then, the University saw the additions of two new programs: the Iovine and Young Academy, funded by music moguls Jimmy Iovine and Andre “Dr. Dre” Young, and the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, both of which have reached prominence since their respective establishments.
“When you look across the landscape of USC’s history, you can point to a handful of milestones that have transformed our entire academic community,” Nikias told reporters when Iovine and Young pledged $70 million to start the academy in 2013. “Today we mark the beginning of something revolutionary.”
The University broke ground for the Academy last year, while the Kaufman school’s new building opened in 2016.
Nikias’ tenure also saw the opening of several new buildings, including the Ronald Tutor Campus Center in 2010, Wallis Annenberg Hall in 2014 and Michelson Hall in 2017. Michelson Hall, an expansive biotech center, is currently the largest building on campus, taking up 190,000 square feet of the University Park Campus.
“The greatest advances in human history occur not merely when the sciences collaborate, but when they converge on a particular problem with strategy and purpose,” Nikias said at Michelson Hall’s groundbreaking in 2014.
The new structures exemplify Nikias’ doctrine: to strive for collaboration and innovation.
 
A lifelong membership to the Trojan Family elite 
While Nikias’ presidency has come to an end, his involvement on campus has not. He has stepped into the role of President Emeritus and Life Trustee of the University, and still enjoys respect from members of the community who value his educational and fundraising capabilities.
His position as Life Trustee does not give him voting power at board meetings, but he “may attend meetings of the Board and its Committees and participate in discussions,” according to University bylaws.
Although his presidency was marred by a flurry of scandals, not everyone believes Nikias should fully disengage with USC. 
“I have been pretty frank and straightforward saying it’s time for the president to step down, but he’s a tenured professor at this university,” professor William Tierney wrote in the Chronicle of Higher Education. “He’s certainly welcomed to stay at the university and continue his research and I hope teaching. He’s a wonderful teacher.”
Nikias will retain limited power in the administration as the school year commences. As former trustee Wanda Austin gets acclimated to her role as the University’s interim president, Nikias will assist her transition as well as that of the president after her. 
“Dr. Nikias has tremendous experience with the people we do business with, and I think that the new president would be at a tremendous disadvantage if he or she didn’t have access to our previous president,” Austin said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
His continued involvement with the University is not unusual for past presidents; former president Steven B. Sample also assumed an advisory role after his presidency. Austin says Nikias, like others before him, has earned a sabbatical, which would be a “natural and important” step for a refresh.
“He has an excellent reputation as an engineer, a scientist, a philosopher,” Austin said. “Why wouldn’t you want your students to be able to have access to someone like that and for him to bring that wealth of talent to this campus?”
In the end, the “Six Billion Dollar Man” will be back doing what he does best: fundraising.
