The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Friday, Nov. 30, and Sunday, Dec. 2. 
 
Crimes against property
at 5:24 p.m. on Dec. 2, a student reported that his bicycle was removed from a bike rack while he was shopping at Ralph’s Supermarket. DPS officers subsequently detained a suspect who was identified using footage from store surveillance cameras. The suspect was found in possession of the student’s bicycle and was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 4:24 p.m. on Dec. 2, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained a cut to his lip when he bumped heads with another player while playing soccer at the John McKay Center.  The officers examined the student and offered transportation for medical treatment, but he declined and was released to seek it on his own.
at 8:29 P.m. on Nov. 30, a student was cited to Judicial Affairs for climbing from the third floor window of his neighbor’s dorm room into his own room in Trojan Residence Hall in order to avoid paying a fee to open the door after locking his keys inside.
at 7:44 p.m. on Nov. 30, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect in a vehicle driving away from Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street after colliding with an unknown object. The officers located the suspect in the vehicle stopped in a traffic lane with a flat tire and when they detained him for questioning they determined he was intoxicated. LAPD officers subsequently took custody of the suspect and he was arrested after failing a field sobriety test.
Having video tape of the bike theft proves nothing.  That can all be fabricated.  The technology out there is amazing!
YOU have to PAY to get your dorm room opened?
Boy, do we respect our students!

A recent study has found that scientific methods currently used to measure the carbon footprint of various products is not sufficient in determining their actual impacts on the environment.
The two studies conducted by Robert Vos of the USC Spacial Studies Institute, published in the November edition of the journal Environmental Impact Assessment Review, state that the available science cannot give an accurate report of the carbon footprint impact of products as basic as paper.
Vos argues that the problem with the current science is what it measures. Vos said that carbon footprint labels should specifically take into consideration the location of production and the effects on surrounding land use.
For instance, when Vos and Joshua Newell of the University of Michigan studied the carbon footprint of paper in U.S. and Chinese supply chains, they found a significantly varying impact according to the forest harvested, which labels do not currently acknowledge.
According to Vos, forests serve as the “planet’s lungs,” meaning they absorb and store carbon dioxide, and when trees are harvested for paper this process is affected.
“The type of forest and the harvest practices are, hands down, the most crucial thing to measure about any wood-based product,” Vos said in a press release.
The study analyzes three existing international protocols for quantifying carbon footprints and proposes changes to include management practices of forests.
Some studies suggest that the loss of forests accounts for about 20 percent of the entire greenhouse gas emissions worldwide annually.
“We need to do a much better job incorporating the carbon emissions associated with forest-based products to tackle climate change,” Newell said in a press release. “From our study, it is clear that from a greenhouse gas emissions perspective, not all paper is created equal.”
Some scientists speculate that the reason behind these inaccurate carbon footprints is companies that put profit before environmental effects.
“There’s a big struggle between industry and the environment,” said Maya Lusk, a freshman majoring in environmental studies. “Industries are not interested in having environmental-friendly products; they are most interested in profit and a lot of the time, environmental alternatives are more expensive.”
Vos said most retailers of paper items don’t even know where their paper fiber comes from.
Some students like Sam Cheng, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, also said  that environmental concerns sometimes take a backseat to convenience.
“Most people think the need for quality comes before the environmental impact,” Cheng said.
Maya Lusk’s assertion that businesses are interested in eenvironmentally friendly products is simply not true. They ARE interested if they could use the environmentally friendly angle to sell more products, something that is becoming increasingly widespread these days as the public’s environmental consciousness continues to grow.

On Friday, the nation awaited the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the cases challenging California’s Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act. Those expecting the court to make a decision Friday were left in suspense, however, as the court did not decide whether it would hear cases related to either of the laws.
The justices met behind closed doors to decide which of the cases, including the appeal of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal’s decision to strike down Prop. 8, would receive a full hearing next year. If it chooses to address the DOMA, the Supreme Court would be tasked with resolving differences in constitutionality in different courts. Appeals courts in New York and Boston struck down parts of DOMA as unconstitutional.
“There are a number of conflicts among the lower courts in terms of the decisions that need to be resolved,” said Ange-Marie Hancock, associate professor of political science at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “One of those in particular is the level of scrutiny that is applied to laws that treat people differently on the bases of their sexual orientation. So the primary job of the Supreme Court is to resolve questions like when different federal circuits disagree about the level of scrutiny that should be applied.”
If the court chooses to hear Prop. 8, it would be tasked with deciding if the Ninth Circuit’s ruling against same-sex marriage should stand.
The courts could also decide not to hear any cases having to do with the two laws. Hancock said this is a strong possibility considering the background of the court.
“The court is very divided politically about this issue, given earlier decisions in last year’s term. For example, the health care decision,” she said. “The court may not want to take on another political case like that right now because things are delicate in internal dynamics.”
Those same dynamics could also cause the court difficulty in coming to a decision, Hancock said.
“They don’t feel that they have a strong opinion, meaning they can’t come to an agreement about what the level of scrutiny should be,” she said. “They might just keep the status quo and in some cases, that means that same-sex marriage would become the law of the land, like in California.”
If the Supreme Court chooses not to hear the case, the lower court’s decision will stand, ruling Prop. 8 unconstitutional and allowing same-sex couples to marry in California.
Justice Kennedy is among those who could effectively decide the two cases were they to go to court. According to Hancock, Kennedy has often been the swing vote in the last 20 years and as a result, both sides are using his likelihood to side with them as the barometer of the cases’ outcomes.
“My guess is some of the conservatives might think that they have a slightly better shot at swaying him, despite the fact that he has voted with the liberals in the past on a lot of general issues,” Hancock said.
Students such as Emily Huang, a sophomore majoring in human biology and sociology, believe the case for Prop. 8 should be heard because of the opportunity to set a national precedent.
“They should hear the case because it could possibly set the precedent for legalizing gay marriage in the entire U.S.,” Huang said. “Their inaction makes me think that they may not, which I find interesting because that will defer the decision to the Appeals Court, which would legalize gay marriage in California.”
However, other students like Cameron Gilbert, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering and East Asian languages and cultures, said they understand why the court might not take on the cases.
“Given the current heated political climate and the hysteria over the incoming fiscal disaster, I can understand why it might get pushed to the side,” Gilbert said. “I don’t quite know exactly how the SC decides what to review, so it’s certainly possible that more pressing issues were on the table — especially as more and more states continue to legalize gay marriage every year it seems like it won’t be long before it’s defaulted into a non-issue.”
This Friday, the court will once again meet to discuss which cases they will hear next year.

Creativity, inspiration and writing dominated the conversation when playwright, screenwriter and actor Jon Robin Baitz spoke to students in Doheny Memorial Library. The triple threat read aloud from his works, chatted with author Dinah Lenney and answered questions from audience members during the event.
Multitalented · Playwright Jon Robin Baitz discusses his sources of inspiration and writing method during a Monday event in Doheny Memorial Library. Baitz created the TV series Brothers and Sisters as well as multiple plays. – Caitlin Ito | Daily Trojan
Baitz began the evening by reading the introduction to his play Three Hotels and a smattering from the play itself. The excerpts Baitz read told the story of a corporate man well versed in firing employees, earned loud applause from the captive audience.
Lenney then asked Baitz a series of questions ranging from how he got his start as a playwright to his inspiration and the differences between writing plays and television scripts.
Baitz got many laughs from the audience with his explanation of his writing process.
“I honor procrastination and laziness as the unconscious at work,” he said.
The plays Baitz creates tend to follow everyday people moving through their daily routines. He also strives to write works that the audience can relate to, often drawing on his experience as a young man in South Africa during the apartheid.
“I look to create a kind of moment in plays where you see yourself,” Baitz said. “I want to create a theater where we do feel complicit and we recognize our own fallibility and the potential we have for doing terrible things and, even worse, ignoring terrible things.”
Baitz is in Los Angeles while his play Other Desert Cities runs at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Besides Other Desert Cities, Baitz has written several other plays,including The Paris Letter. He has also written for the television shows The West Wing and Alias, as well as created the ABC drama Brothers & Sisters. In addition to writing, Baitz also teaches aspiring playwrights.
The event, which spanned nearly two hours, was hosted by the USC Master of Professional Writing program. The MPW program uses Los Angeles’ vibrant entertainment and literature scenes to try to inspire students in multiple genres of writing, including fiction, poetry, and writing for the stage. It is the first multi-genre program in the country, and hosts multiple events throughout the year that range from panel discussions to lectures from guest writers.
Prince Gomolvilas, acting director of the MPW program, helped plan the event, and credited Baitz with some of his personal inspiration.
“Jon Robin Baitz, for me, is personally one of my playwriting heroes, so I thought this seemed like a wonderful opportunity,” Gomolvilas said. “But the main reason why he’s here is because his play … is running at the Mark Taper Forum and it just seemed very appropriate to bring somebody who has work going on right now.”
The audience included both students and adults, many of whom had already seen Baitz’s play and wished to hear more from him. Kiersten Stanley, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, said she found the event valuable.
“I thought it was definitely interesting to get the perspective of a professional playwright and screenwriter who has had decades of experience in his craft,” she said.
Other Desert Cities runs now through Jan. 6 at the Mark Taper Forum in Downtown Los Angeles.

The Halo series has always been one of the most revered franchises in video games. Its story and multiplayer features have been enjoyed by millions, and series protagonist Master Chief has become one of the major icons of the Xbox platform. So when news spread that the Halo franchise would be given to a new developer, 343 Industries rather than Bungie, many fans worried that it would be the end of an era. Don’t worry though, Halo 4 combines fan service and a few changes to create a worthy successor to the acclaimed trilogy.
Campaign
Halo 4 finds Master Chief still in a cryogenic state aboard the ship “Forward Unto Dawn.” He is awakened by his artificial intelligence companion Cortana once the ship reaches a planet known as Requiem. There, the rogue Covenant, one of the main enemy forces in the series, boards the ship, causing it to crash-land on the planet below.
Halo 4’s story focuses on the relationship between Master Chief and Cortana. Cortana is reaching the end of the natural life cycle for AIs, which is about seven years. Master Chief, while fighting the main antagonist,  forerunner the Didact, must also try to fix Cortana; this story probably provides the most emotion for Master Chief that players have seen in a Halo game. You get to see how Cortana deteriorates over time, and also how it affects Master Chief, both emotionally and in action.
The campaign takes about six hours to complete, which is about average for a first-person shooter but seems to end relatively quickly. The campaign also adds a little more variety in the missions, throwing in quick-time events and vehicle missions, all of which work well within the story. The main antagonist, however, only makes an appearance a couple times during the story, and never seems to be as developed as well as he could have been. But despite this slight issue, this is a campaign well worth completing, and it will provide some great fan service to long-time players.
Multiplayer
Multiplayer — or War Games, as it’s referred to in Halo 4 — is the standard by which all first-person shooters are measured nowadays, and Halo 4 doesn’t at all disappoint in this department. This version provides a much more customizable experience than before, while still maintaining the classic Halo gameplay fans have always loved. The classic Halo game modes are here, including Team Slayer, Slayer, Capture the Flag, Oddball and King of the Hill. Fan-favorite game mode Grifball is now its own playlist, along with Flood (previously known as Infection). The maps are well designed, allowing for all different styles of play, whether slow and tactical or run-and-gun, to be viable in the multiplayer environment.
The game’s biggest change to the multiplayer experience is in the player customization. Players can now create their own custom loadouts, allowing them to pick their own primary weapon, pistol, grenade, tactical package and support upgrade. Though this feature was briefly explored in Halo: Reach, Halo 4 allows you to cater your loadout to your playing style. Similar to Call of Duty, there are even challenges that unlock experience for earning a certain amount of kills or medals, and the commendations from Halo: Reach return, updating every day, week or month.
Armor customization is just as big a part of this game as in previous games, allowing for thousands of possible armor combinations. And though the emblem customization hasn’t changed too much, it still provides enough of an opportunity to express yourself with a unique team player logo. But, you have to reach a certain level in order to unlock certain emblems, which is an unusual decision on 343 Industries’ part.
Spartan ops
Spartan Ops, Halo 4’s new game mode, is a story-driven series of multiplayer missions that 343 Industries adds to every week. Each mission, which takes about 15 minutes to complete, starts off with a cut-scene that gives you the mission objectives. All the missions culminate into one storyline, which is divided into seasons, allowing fans to receive new episodes every week, similar to a TV series.
Though the idea is innovative, and provides a longer story arc than the one in the campaign, it takes the place of Firefight, a horde-style game mode that was featured in Halo 3: ODST and Halo: Reach. Considering it was a popular choice for many fans, it seems a bit unusual that this game mode was excluded from this game. Fans hoping for a revamped Firefight experience will be sorely disappointed, although Spartan Ops does what it intends to do very well.
Final Verdict
If you’re afraid to continue the Halo series because of a new developer, don’t be. 343 Industries does an excellent job continuing the storied franchise, making sure to keep the campaign and multiplayer up to Halo standards while adding its own unique elements to the franchise. Though Spartan Ops isn’t as successful, and doesn’t quite fill the void left behind by Firefight, Halo 4 still serves up a compelling experience that will keep old and new fans alike glued to their controllers.

A young woman goes to teach at a school for children with tuberculosis and ends up falling in love with the director. But before they can marry, she is sent packing on the next available train to Toronto.
A woman recounts the events leading up to the drowning of her older sister. A retired high school teacher introduces her new friend to her husband, who turns out to be the friend’s former lover.
All of these stories make up Canadian writer Alice Munro’s newest volume of short stories, Dear Life. These portraits of small-town life, mostly set in little towns around Munro’s hometown of Lake Huron, Canada, paint intimate portraits of characters whose lives are forever changed by small actions, both within and beyond their control.
Peppered with characters both strong and weak, intelligent and dim-witted, Dear Life brings Canada’s landscape to life. In the end, all must contend and accept changes in their lives, changes that forever alter their understandings of who they are.
Munro’s writing is patient and detailed. Each story, though only encompassing a certain period in a character’s life, speaks volumes about what has come before and what will come after.
“Gravel,” one of the strongest stories in the collection, recounts the series of events that led to the drowning of the narrator’s older sister. Munro, however, composes the story  to reveal the circumstances that drove the narrator’s mother to leave her husband and have an affair with an irresponsible actor in a trailer, all of which contribute to the unhappiness of the narrator’s sister.
Munro reveals through her stories that it isn’t just the life-changing moments that define who we are — it is our collective decisions that propel us forward on our unique trajectory. The lingering questions the speaker must contend with years later, as she thinks about her sister’s death, are just as important to her the loss itself.
Dear Life paints life as a complicated web where things become difficult, messy and sometimes unbearable. Within these stories, the reader experiences characters’ trials and tribulations, forming his or her own connection to the events. Though life in Canada during the Great Depression might not be familiar to us, the agony of financial struggle is a definite reality.
The connections readers establish with the characters go beyond fiction and reality because these characters mirror our own struggles and worries, albeit within a different environment.
These stories are not just about the moments that change lives. They also fit together to create a web of interconnected humanity, which is humanity depicted through an assortment of individuals who might not live lives of glamour and action, but are still profoundly affected by the smallest changes in their circumstances.
Dear Life extends that interconnectedness not only across space, but also time as well. The stories take place around Lake Huron during the Great Depression, the 1970s and in between. By blurring temporal lines, Munro shows how the difficulties of life span generations. Lake Huron might have gone through aesthetic changes throughout the years, but in the end, the people who populate that region must still contend with the same difficulties as previous generations.
Munro’s stories, however, are not in the same sentimental, saccharine vein as Nicholas Sparks novels or the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. They are mature works that seriously look at class struggle, poverty, sex and education. Though the stories that make up Dear Life focus on the small moments, they continuously speak about these larger issues.
Still, though Munro’s stories contain plenty of surprises and poignant changes, her detailed depictions of the lives of ordinary people — most of them poor and living during the Great Depression — will prove challenging to readers that expect rapidly moving plotlines and dramatic stream of consciousness. Munro’s stories take a much slower pace than most books that top the best seller charts, and involve subjects that are less than romantic. For people who expect neat, optimistic endings to their stories, Dear Life will not have much to offer.
But for people who want to read stories that challenge simplistic notions of life and reflect personal difficulties, Munro’s stories are worth the time invested. In their own way, Munro’s lethargic, quiet portraits of small-town life are filled with just as much upheavals, loss and redemption as the most dramatic young adult novel.
The characters in the stories that make up Dear Life are our mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers. Though many of Munro’s characters, if passed on the street, would be regarded as average, they are people whose lives are profoundly affected by single moments and choices. Munro’s characters speak to us because they mirror ourselves and our fears of the choices we make in our lives.
What readers will come away with after reading Dear Life will vary. But they will all share one thing: an understanding that life will progress, whether we want it to or not.
The only way to navigate the sometimes treacherous waters of life is to embrace change, to try to understand as much as we can and move forward. Some characters in Dear Life do that, and some do not. But it is their stories that will allow readers to look back on their own lives and find the will to push on forward.

The norm for a gallery visit is to stand back with your drink and admire the art on display — no touching allowed. No matter the type of art, the piece must remain pristine for its eventual buyer and can be viewed only from a distance.
Arranging artwork · “Queen Hive Layer” features movable sheets that form a flower background, a funky pattern and a woman’s face. – Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
Yet that accepted convention didn’t hold true at a recent show from street art group CYRCLE. Some of the pieces in its “Organized Chaos” show broke with tradition and invited gallery-goers to experiment with movable pieces. Visitors young and old played with items such as flowers, large blocks and jigsaw-esque pieces to their heart’s content.
As a three — and now two — person group, CYRCLE. boasts many murals around the city and creates its own look with the incorporation of images such as skulls shaped by flowers and the repetition of words such as “chaos” and “order.” The group recently took  a month to complete an 11,000 square foot mural, titled “Magic is Real,” that can be seen on the walls of Bedrock LA in Echo Park. “Organized Chaos” marks the group’s second solo effort, but it continues to grow through projects such as its latest mural. The group looks to create works that will engender a positive reaction in the community members that see them.
The parts of “Queen Hive Layer” seem like they should fit together. They do not combine in a practical, technical manner,  but they work together to create an elusive image of a woman paired with CYRCLE.’s familiar themes of flowers and geometric patterns. The mirrored section, along with the work’s interactivity, bridges the gap between the viewer and the artists. Suddenly, the invisible walls come down and the viewer can experience the work in a more personal, engaging manner. Rather than standing back to take in a completely static work, the viewer can manipulate the work and watch as the next person comes by shifts the pieces once again.
That idea recalls the nature of most street art, which remains public and does not stop viewers from directly interacting with urban artworks. In the street, the art does not stand behind a frame or near a sign that says “Do Not Touch.” Though CYRCLE.’s work might remain inside the walls of the gallery, the art itself is anything but contained.  Like street art, CYRCLE.’s piece invites viewers to participate and does not conform to usual gallery conventions. The artists’ move, then, from outside to inside, holds on to the idea that art should not follow the usual conventions.
In fact, much of what CYRCLE. does relies on breaking conventions. Still, CYRCLE. does adhere to them in its own way. The group focuses on the idea of organized chaos, which especially comes across in “Queen Hive Layer.” Though it initially might strike gallery-goers as puzzling, the piece still uses the gallery wall as a means of display, therefore breaking through normal modes of art interaction within a standard venue for experiencing art.
Breaking convention within a gallery also transforms viewers’ perceptions of a piece of art. “Queen Hive Layer” exists as a piece up for sale, yet it does not seem like just a work to hang on a wall and observe. The interactive element of the work changes the manner in which the artwork exists, even within a new environment such as a house. Whenever a new viewer approaches “Queen Hive Layer,” they approach a new artistic experience.
The art world continually looks to the new and exciting, and focusing on the experience between viewer and art could prove as a big step toward growth. Though the responsibility of creating an engaging show mostly falls to curators, it would benefit artists to also take the viewers’ reactions into consideration. When artists find a way to make viewers consider a work as something beyond just a piece hanging on a wall, they create a new function for art. Not only do art pieces serve as something to own, they also serve as something to engage with. The owners of the interactive pieces can bring out some of their own creativity by moving the pieces and making their own unique version “Queen Hive Layer.” Art, then, becomes about drawing out the imagination of the viewer.
As artists continue to create, they can look for new ways to eliminate the distance between artist and viewer. When the viewer can see the craft of the artist but also the thought put in to creating a new dynamic, something very different occurs. The piece becomes more than just a means of showing the talent of the artist — it serves as a method of bringing an idea to life and making art more than just aesthetically pleasing. Ultimately, a work that goes beyond being a visually impressive creation will leave an impression on viewers and buyers. Each person that can share a unique experience with an artwork will not only remember that piece more vividly, but will see art as something much more than the applying of a medium onto some form of canvas. With more experimentation from artists as the art world grows, interactive artwork will continue to generate pieces that resonate profoundly with viewers.
 
“Organized Chaos!” runs until Dec. 16 and is located at 6608 Lexington Ave.

“I think my love for ice cream was really ingrained during my high school years with my first job at Baskin-Robbins,” said Edward Belden, owner of Peddler’s Creamery in Downtown, which is due to open in December.
Here’s the scoop · Workers at Peddler’s Creamery serve up unique ice cream flavors, such as sweet potato pie. The churning method, which requires pedaling on a bicycle, is also unique — hence the shop’s name. – | Photo courtesy of Edward Belen
Belden has seemingly always had a thing for scoops and cones; he still recalls the sheer enjoyment of digging into ice cream at  birthdays celebrated as a child. This passion would extend to his first job as a server at Baskin-Robbins.
“I got to taste ice cream all the time and enjoy all the different flavors out there,” Belden said.
But Belden’s passions are also a little more sentimental. In addition to the countless possibilities of flavors, ice cream also intrigued him because, as he put it, “People tended to walk away pretty happy with the final product.” Belden knew then that serving ice cream would be more to him than just a part-time job.
Starting a couple years ago, Belden started to experiment with the ice cream-making process. He took some advice from a friend to jumpstart his own business. He mixed and matched ingredients on a small scale and started to take classes on how to create better flavors. In these classes, he learned how to further advance his creativity and business. And finally, with his newfound inspiration, Belden decided to create a business and put a different spin on making ice cream — literally.
“I’m always interested in finding a new way to do things. I’ve been interested in bicycling for a long time, so I thought hey, why not churn ice cream with a bicycle?” Belden said.
Not too long after, the name was conceived. A play on both “peddling” and “pedaling” ice cream, Peddler’s Creamery, Belden decided, was the perfect name for his shop. And when it comes to Belden’s wares, the ice cream satisfies as well.
Peddler’s ice cream has already made appearances at the monthly Downtown Art Walk, Xlixe Pizzeria in Little Tokyo and, appropriately enough, at CicLAvia, an event that clears the notoriously congested streets of Los Angeles for a day of worry-free biking.
Belden, with the help of friends and employees, has also debuted  many flavors, such as kumquat and strawberry basil, on the signature Peddler’s bicycle.
In addition to these flavors, Belden listed off other flavors his shop will offer, including Mexican chocolate, sweet potato pie, gingerbread and vegan salted caramel.
But there is more to the business than the unique ice cream flavors and churning method. As a benefit corporation, Peddler’s Creamery gives 5 percent of its profits to various social and environmental causes. Currently, the business is donating profits and collecting funds that will go toward Hurricane Sandy relief efforts.
Peddler’s also occupies a prime location in Downtown Los Angeles. Calling a quaint space on Main Street home, Peddler’s is surrounded by other Downtown favorites including Bäco Mercat, Blossom, Big Man Bakes and Pete’s Café & Bar. As soon as the ice cream shop opens, Angelenos can grab a bite at one of these Main Street restaurants and top the meal off with a scoop of Peddler’s ice cream.
Aside from the mass foodie appeal of Main Street, Belden chose to open shop in Downtown for more edifying reasons, as well. Belden explained that when he made the decision to run his own ice cream shop, he had his sights already set on Downtown.
“A lot of folks [in Downtown] are open-minded, and to have a new lifestyle in Los Angeles would allow me to re-establish connections with the city hub,” Belden said.
But the best part of having a store in Downtown? Its close proximity to hungry and adventurous USC students.
“[Peddler’s] is a great excuse to hop on a bike or the metro from a quick escape from school — to enjoy a delicious treat that is made with organic ingredients,” Belden said.
Undoubtedly, every moment of Belden’s 2 1/2 year long journey to make Peddler’s a reality has been worthwhile.
“There’s been a building vibe of creativity in Downtown … with a long tradition of art — a new feeling of new urbanism, a new experience,” Belden said.
And already, Belden is pursuing what many hope to do in the near future — what he loves and does best.
It might be a stretch to say that Belden is the modern-day Willy Wonka for ice cream, constantly coming up with different, creative flavors. But when it comes to his store, he has the heart and the mind for it, churning out one bright idea after another.

We hear so often about money in college sports. Head coaches bolt for other schools for more money. Schools build new training facilities and expand 60,000-seat stadiums to eventually earn more money. Conferences expand to add new members to increase the geographic footprint they point out, to annex television markets and, yes, to haul in more money.
If the landscape of modern-day college athletics teaches us anything, it’s that administrative decisions are quite often based on money and profits. What makes the most fiscal sense for a university and its athletic department? What ensures long-term stability?
Considering all that, why would USC be any different?
I pose that question foremost because people remain surprised. Fans have been grappling with the strange concept of USC keeping the status quo after arguably the most disappointing season on the gridiron in school history, a 7-5 finish with back-to-back losses to hated rivals UCLA and Notre Dame (keeping the status quo, meaning retaining coach Lane Kiffin and enacting minimal changes, at least thus far).
But if you really think about, is it all that surprising, really? Think green here.
Despite what has happened on the field in recent months, things are going pretty well for the USC athletic department at least in terms of its finances. The school reported record athletic-related revenue for the 2011-12 academic year — $84.19 million, according to documents filed with the U.S. Department of Education in October. Senior Associate Athletic Director Steve Lopes credited an increase in donations and corporate sponsorship for the $10 million jump in revenue during an interview at the time with The Orange County Register.
Average attendance per game at the Coliseum this fall also stood at 87,945, the highest average mark since 2006, and USC notched four sellout games against Hawai’i, Colorado, Oregon and Notre Dame. So there’s plenty reason to suggest the program isn’t facing any substantial drop in ticket sale revenue for the next year. Hundreds of thousands of people made it to their seats, or at least purchased a ticket.
Moreover, the John McKay Center, a $70 million, 110,000-square-foot athletic facility, opened in August. And on top of this, the school announced “The Heritage Initiative,” a $300 million athletic fundraising campaign, with the school reportedly halfway toward reaching that mark.
And in the wake of NCAA sanctions, levied in June 2010 for a “lack of institutional control,” the university is widely considered the nation’s leader in athletic compliance, with a staff of approximately 14 employees, among the largest of any higher education institution. Suddenly, USC’s in everyone’s good graces.
Yes, financially and in terms of its national perception, USC is doing rather well.
So really, why make changes, why do anything that would drastically alter the direction of the department? Why panic? Why reverse course? In a sense, everything’s peachy.
Athletic directors typically enact change for the sake of finances. A bad coach might result in a bad season, a sub-.500 season. Then, nobody shows up for the games, there’s poor attendance, fewer folks make donations and there’s a drop in revenue. Eventually, the school will opt to go in a new direction, or however it wishes to phrase it in the press release. It has to, in order to maintain those finances and stay competitive.
But in several respects, despite on-the-field struggles, USC stands fine. It’s got quite a bit of revenue; it’s even profiting.
So though many fans have been anticipating — and even clamoring — for change for change’s sake, it doesn’t appear likely.
USC Athletic Director Pat Haden has mentioned during several interviews in recent weeks that it’s his job to make “rational decisions,” in spite of the frustration and demands for change (i.e. firing Kiffin).
Though USC’s football program might be a disappointment, men’s basketball is coming off a historically poor season (a program-worst of 26 losses) and baseball continues to hang around the bottom of the Pac-12, wholesale changes don’t appear in order.
Kiffin will return next fall. Men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill and baseball coach Frank Cruz’s jobs also appear relatively safe.
If USC is fiscally sound, it wouldn’t be rational to go against the status quo now.
So you want change? Maybe think about how you use your wallet.
 
“The 19th Hole” ran Tuesdays. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Joey at jrkaufma@usc.edu.
 
I have no bone to pick with this article, except  that  the pre-season hype had the Trojans number one in the polls, and that was the primary  reason for the extra revenue.  Think about it– If a team is not rated very high,and they lose 2 of their first 3 games, (but recover to be 8-3), then their revenues will still be down, because, without the hype, it would take 3 or 4 games to start bringing back the fans.
This is a relatively naive article. Of course, finances are a significant consideration for any college and especially a private one like USC. This includes not only the financial performance of the athletic programs, but the influence on donations which are difficult to estimate accurately.
The naive aspect of this article is that no good manager looks at just the current year financial performance. They are also very concerned about future years and  the athletic department depends primarily on the performance of the football team. There are many reasons not to make a head coaching change to the football team now including:
1. There are 2 more years of sanctions and there is little likelihood of a very good coach wanting to come to USC during this period with the known 10 scholarship reductions per year and the overall limited reduced scholarships giving the Trojans a competitive disadvantage.
2. The disappointing play of the football team in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to mistakes made by the players (INTs, fumbles, penalties, missed blocks, dropped passes and missed tackles). Sure coaching plays a significant role but the USC coaching staff overall was just as strong in 2012 as 2011 but the results were much different. Part of the reason was limited tackling in practice due to 10 scholarship reductions and 10 season ending injuries to scholarship players. But, football is a game and sometimes bad things happen. If you analyze carefully the player mistakes most were not a result of coaching mistakes.
3. The media that attended all football practices in spring, fall and during the season didn’t report any issues with the USC coaching preparing the players properly except the concern over limited tackling due to reduced scholarships (down 20 scholarship players including season ending injuries).
4. USC has another top recruiting class that may be the best one in the last 3 years even with the reduced numbers. That would surely be impacted by significant coaching changes.
5. USC lost 5 games by about 1 TD each. If just a few plays had gone differently in each game, USC would still be undefeated even with all the issues relative to player mistakes, coach play calling and defensive schemes especially on 3rd down.
6. USC will do much better in 2013. The biggest issue in 2012 was the inconsistent play of the OL. Holmes is the only starter to replace and Markowitz should do that nicely. Kiffin has more quality OL now than anytime during his tenure and that will make a big difference in 2013. Furthermore a new DC will fix the scheme issues and the defense will be stronger with only some of the secondary to rebuild.
You also have to consider who else is on the market right now…there’s no point in dropping a mediocre coach to pick up a bad one.
Our football program generates enough revenue to support all of the other men’s and women’s sports programs combined.  So based on ticket sales and television contracts, one could argue that this season was a “success” in terms of finances.  But we, as Trojan fans, do NOT accept mediocrity on the field and this football season was mediocre at best.  In my opinion, Haden should have fired Kiffin for his 25-12 win-loss record after three seasons.  That’s a 68% success rate, which is well below most people’s standards this side of Westwood.
This is one of the stupidest articles I’ve ever read. 
Part of the increase in revenue was due to the fact that SC is coming off of sanctions and that amplified the fans’ excitement. Also, we started at #1 and there was a ton of hype regarding this team. It was this hype that generated a lot of the fan interest. With the exception of Colorado, all of the sellout games were BIG games. First game of season, against Oregon, the #2 team, and against Notre Dame, our biggest rival and the #1 team. 
It’s stupid to think Kiffin is the reason that the team is generating more revenue. It was Barkley, Lee and Woods. It was Silas Redd, Mcneal, and the rest of the hype. It was the fact that economy has been at about the best since 2006. Anyone who looks at this team and thinks, “Lane Kiffin is making us a loooot of money,” has the logical capacity of a parrot. 
Don’t be surprised if there is a significant decrease in revenue next year. The only hope is that the team outperforms people’s expectations because there isn’t a lot of hype.
The major sport programs at USC now are pretty much  mediocre or worse. See how well the attendance is
for next year in football with lowly Boston College the only out of conference game at home, and not Oregon
or Notre Dame coming to the Coliseum. Basketball is going nowhere with the men and women, baseball has
reached the proverbial bottom, and track & field has leveled off to being just there nationally. These sports do
not draw well at all especially with the student body. The sad part is the influential alumni doesn’t take a stand
with the athletic dept. , and demand changes be made to improve these other sports that were once very
competitive.
This might be the worst opinion piece I have ever read.  Ticket sales (and thus athletic department’s revenues) are good this year because people were expecting a championship run in football, and that did not happen. Next year you will write about how attendance is way down. AD’s have to be forward thinkers, and PH has not demonstrated that ability as of yet. 
BTW the entire country has labeled USC as ‘cheaters’, partly because PH has failed to defend USC in any forceful way. What a shame.

Offensive struggles plagued USC’s men’s basketball team in the squad’s first true road game of the season, as the Trojans only converted 37.5 percent of their shots in a 63-51 loss to Nebraska.
Shooting woes · Shooting only 22.6 percent from the field on the season, senior guard Jio Fontan scored 11 points at Nebraska on Wednesday night. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Perimeter defense was also a problem for USC (3-4), as Nebraska guard Ray Gallegos put on a shooting clinic, tallying 20 points while making six of 10 attempts from 3-point range to lead the Huskers (6-1) to victory.
Overall, Nebraska sank 11 of its 17 attempts from beyond the arc for an astronomical 3-point shooting percentage of 64.7 percent. On the season, USC has now allowed 53 3-point field goals in seven games. By comparison, the Trojans have only converted 34 3-pointers of their own.
“That’s a recipe for disaster on the road against good team like [Nebraska],” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We have a bunch of guys that need to start feeling each other out on offense and defense.”
USC’s starting backcourt was comparatively inefficient. Junior guard J.T. Terrell led the Trojans with 14 points, but Terrell and senior guard Jio Fontan combined to make just nine of their 24 shots.
“I couldn’t say that anybody played well tonight,” O’Neill said. “We’ve got great guys who want to do something to make a play, but we need to play a little more off each other instead of guys trying to do it themselves.”
Terrell came into the game leading USC with 12.5 points per game, but is shooting only 30.7 percent on field goal attempts, and Fontan’s statistics (22.6 percent shooting, 7.7 points per game) are even worse.
The Trojans started out the season by scoring 87 points against Coppin State, but have averaged only 60 points per game in six contests since then.
“Some of that is just not making shots,” O’Neill said. “[But] we’re not together enough yet offensively or defensively to win games we need to win.”
The two teams traded runs throughout the first half.
USC took an early 5-2 lead, but from there, the Huskers went on a 10-2 run as the Trojans struggled through a cold shooting streak that saw them make only one of their 10 shots over an eight-minute stretch.
The Trojans struck back with an 11-2 run to take a 18-14 lead with 7:13 remaining, but some timely shooting from beyond the arc sparked Nebraska through the rest of the first half.
Nebraska guard David Rivers made a 3-pointer that jump-started an 8-0 run.
Then, after USC forward James Blasczyk converted a layup to tie the game at 22, Gallegos caught fire and knocked down three 3-pointers during the last four minutes of the half to ignite the Huskers to a 33-25 halftime advantage.
“[Gallegos] made some big-time shots,” O’Neill said. “That’s something we gotta bounce back from.”
Nebraska continued its hot streak in the second half with a 11-2 run out of the locker room to give them a 44-27 lead.
As the Huskers’ offense thrived, the Trojans’ sputtered — Terrell’s 3-pointer with 3:15 left in the first half was the last field goal USC would make for more than 10 minutes.
“That’s when you go on the other end of the court and get a great shot, but we haven’t been able to do that,” O’Neill said. “We gotta react better after we get punched in the face like that.”
Fontan made a layup with 12:50 left in the second half to end the cold streak and cut the deficit to 44-30, but the Huskers continued to push the offensive pressure, eventually building a 52-32 lead that proved to be insurmountable.
USC cut the lead down in the final minutes and held Nebraska scoreless in the final 3:52, but it was far too late for any comeback attempt.
The Trojans still have two ranked opponents to face this week — on the road again Wednesday night at 7 p.m. against No. 18 New Mexico (8-0), and at home for a clash against No. 14 Minnesota on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.

DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic comprise two-fifths of the tight-knit fraternity of former USC basketball players currently competing in the NBA.
Change of scenery · After only averaging 5.5 points and 15.9 minutes per game with the Philadelphia 76ers as a rookie, Nikola Vucevic, the former No. 16 overall 2011 draft pick, is nearly doubling those totals with the Magic. – Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
Before a mid-November game between DeRozan’s Toronto Raptors and Vucevic’s Orlando Magic, the two former Trojans reminisced about their lone season as collegiate teammates.
According to Vucevic, “DeMar said, ‘Man, you have come a long way. When you were a freshman, nobody knew who you were, and you did not play a lot. Now you are starting in the NBA.’”
“I did not really think about it until then,” Vucevic said.
With DeRozan starring for the Trojans during the 2008-09 season, Vucevic averaged only 2.6 points per game as a skinny freshman. He struggled to earn playing time and was still adjusting to American culture after arriving from Montenegro the year before.
DeRozan declared for the NBA after only one year, and Vucevic began to blossom under Kevin O’Neill, who had replaced Tim Floyd as USC’s coach.
“I pushed him every day,” O’Neill said, “because I knew he could be better.”
Vucevic put on muscle and developed his outside shot and was named the 2010 Pac-10 Most Improved Player. The next year he was named to the All-Pac-12 first team and led the Trojans to the NCAA tournament.
He went on to be selected by the Philadelphia 76ers as the 16th pick in the 2011 NBA draft.
Traditional rookie hazing was far from the only grief Vucevic received from his 76ers teammates last season.
Playing alongside four players who competed at Pac-12 schools — California’s Francisco Elson, Washington’s Spencer Hawes, UCLA’s Jrue Holiday and Arizona’s Andre Iguodala — Vucevic received numerous reminders that his Trojans were struggling through a 6-26 season without him.
“[USC] did not win a single game against those teams,” Vucevic said, “so I had to do a lot of extra favors for the veterans.”
On the court, Vucevic averaged 5.5 points in only 15.9 minutes per game. Despite his limited action, he played well enough to attract the attention of the Orlando Magic, who acquired him as part of the blockbuster trade that sent Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers.
Vucevic was working out when he received a call from his agent informing him to pack his bags for Orlando.
“I thought it was a good opportunity for me,” Vucevic said in the Magic locker room before Sunday’s game against the Lakers. “I knew I could have a chance to play on such a young team.”
Vucevic has excelled, starting all 16 games for the Magic. He is averaging 9.9 points and 8.2 rebounds per game, statistics that prompted several of his former USC teammates to draft him on their fantasy teams.
“He is in a great situation,” O’Neill said. “If he was on the Lakers, he would not be putting up those numbers.”
Vucevic has scored in double figures in all 10 games, when playing more than 26 minutes this season.
“He is a very talented big man,” Magic teammate Arron Afflalo said. “You can see his growth mentally from last season in terms of how hard he plays.”
Vucevic no longer has O’Neill shouting in his ear during practices, but has nevertheless been able to maintain a consistent level of intensity.
“The Magic coaching staff pushes me hard,” Vucevic said. “Probably not as much as [O’Neill], but they are working me hard so I get better every day.”
New Magic coach Jacque Vaughn has noticed Vucevic’s work ethic and praised the center’s offensive potential.
“I love coaching him and his approach at practice everyday,” Vaughn said. “He can shoot the basketball and he is very skilled offensively.”
With Vucevic playing so well, on-court reunions with DeRozan could soon become commonplace — and fierce.
“[Vucevic] can really dribble, pass, and shoot,” O’Neill said. “He has the chance to have a long, successful career in the NBA.”
I love how this article didn’t mention OJ Mayo.  The guy is about to be an all-star this season in the NBA. He is killing it.
Please refresh my memory with the six former Trojans playing in the NBA. My list is as follows:
1. Nikola Vucevic……..2. DeMar DeRozan……..3. Nick Young……….4. Taj Gibson…….5. O.J. Mayo
 Brian Scalabrine retired this year so who is the sixth? Inquiring mind wants to know. Thanks.

Opponents of Guantanamo Bay, the high-security detainment facility in Cuba used to house detainees believed to be connected with the War on Terror, decry the prison as a violation of civil rights and an  unignorable failure of justice.
A report released last week by the Government Accountability Office indicated that U.S. prisons could safely absorb all 166 detainees currently being held at Guantanamo Bay. The study also reported that prisons across the United States already hold more than 373 prisoners convicted of terrorism, like the ones held at Guantanamo.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
This new government report only adds support to the argument that President Barack Obama and Congress must close the detainment center once and for all.
Obama attempted to close Guantanamo when he took office in 2009 but was blocked by a Republican-led spending bill, part of which focused on the idea that holding detainees in U.S. prisons would encourage terror attacks in the prisons or in surrounding cities. Linked to this is the opinion that these detainees are unique criminals and should be held somewhere specific and isolated.
This argument is largely nonsensical and mistakenly used to support an institution that is unethical and contrary to American values.
The idea that keeping prisoners at Guantanamo is in the best interest of the United States is tied to the notion that transferring these detainees to state prisons would make the country a more likely target for terrorist attacks. But keeping detainees at a naval base in Cuba does not direct terrorist animosities away from the United States.
If anything, Guantanamo fosters a negative international image of the United States. In 2005, The New York Times published an article on how Guantanamo has “come to define U.S. to Muslims.” The article describes high school theater productions in Pakistan that center on the prison, and how the television networks Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya use images of caged and tortured detainees in station promos.
Nevertheless, supporters of the prison adamantly maintain that Guantanamo prisoners are a strong security threat to the U.S. and must be kept away from American soil. Indeed, Guantanamo detainees differ from traditional prisoners — all are believed to pose huge security threats to the United States and are somehow linked to terrorism. But the high-security status of these prisoners actually supports the concept of moving them to various U.S. prisons. It is safer to house these prisoners in undisclosed locations than to have them concentrated in one high-security detainment center.
Beyond the practical reasons that warrant closing Guantanamo, humanitarian concerns make it nonsensical to keep the prison open. Most of these prisoners have never been formally charged with a crime — the U.S. government simply reserves the legal authority to detain anyone they choose until the War on Terror comes to an end.
As a result, the government is able to abstain from giving each prisoner held in Guantanamo a firm sentence and trial, violating very basic rights that all other prisoners receive.
It seems implausible that an institution so contrary to our government’s values and ethics is able to exist in the modern world. Though the country’s humanitarian principles should have never led us to open the prison in the first place, the Government Accountability Office’s new study indicates that there is no better time to close Guantanamo. Keeping the detainment center open sacrifices America’s ethics and reputation. Congress must close the prison immediately and abide by the values that have always kept this country strong,
 
Ryan Townsend is a sophomore majoring in business administration. His column “The Blame Game” ran Tuesdays.
How about some better questions like,
“What countries are actually willing to take these prisoners who are suspected terrorists?” and
“What kind of criticism will we receive if we let countries take the prisoners, and subsequently put them in an even worse humanitarian situation that they’re already in?”
Do you know any countries that are willing to take these suspected terrorists and treat them with more dignity than they’re already receiving?
Put more of them inside.
This problem is real and it stems from the earliest days of the terrorist movement against us, but especially when Pres. George W. Bush said after 9/11 “We gonna git thim terryists an’ bring ’em ta justice.”
This was the wrong approach, based on bad advice. What the Government should have done after 9/11 was to intern any captured terrorists as POWs under the Geneva Convention.
Yes, it is an undeclared war, but a war nonetheless, and these are irregular enemy soldiers. Unless they committed war crimes under the Geneva Convention (such as murdering their prisoners, or civilians) these terrorists should now be detained as POWs. In Guantanamo? Perhaps. Or perhaps in a special POW camp in the US, but not mixed with ordinary domestic criminals.
“Yes,” you might ask, “but for how long?” For the duration of the war until they, and their fellow terrorists, cease to attack the US, its armed forces and its other citizens. Yep. Might be for a century. That happens when you make war against a sovereign country. – Don Harmon, BA, MA, IR at USC.

The week of Thanksgiving marked one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. While millions of Americans braved long lines, delays and incessant security checks at airports, some did something else — they opted out of the Transportation Security full-body scans in protest of the procedure.
Opt-Out Week, an initiative started by libertarian activist Alex Jones from InfoWars.com, took place from Nov. 19 – 26. The week was meant to encourage air travelers to choose a pat-down instead of going through a security scanner.
Opt-Out Week didn’t receive much media attention, but it marked an important attempt to peacefully protest certain controversial air travel security procedures. Its inception also begged a bigger question: Is it time to re-evaluate the role of TSA as a whole? Major downsides of the scanners, coupled with inefficient, expensive and flawed practices, indicate that TSA is in need of major reform.
Airport security breaches in 2010 led to the implementation of full-body scanners as a way to better protect travelers, but the scanners have since been met with heavy criticism. Opponents argue they are dangerous and inadequately tested, leaving those who pass through subject to radiation. In addition, the scanners’ original technology breached privacy by revealing nude images of travelers. Arguably, the scanners also violate the constitutional right provided by the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure.
Proponents of the scanners argue that they foster a safer environment for air travel and speed up the airport security process. Furthermore, travelers do have the option, though probably a little known one, to decline the scan and opt for a pat-down. The pat-down process, however, has also been controversial. Complaints of excessively physical searches and reports of rude remarks have left many travelers uneasy, as well as resulted in a number of lawsuits filed against TSA.
As a result, law and policymakers on both sides of the aisle have begun to advocate for TSA reform. In 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union deemed the scanners a “virtual strip search,” and repeatedly called for the former and current heads of TSA to resign. Earlier this year, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky) introduced legislation that would establish a Passenger Bill of Rights and replace TSA with private security.
The public, too, is unhappy with the way the country’s air security organization operates. Public polling conducted in September found that those who fly most often — and thus have the most interaction with TSA procedures — are the most dissatisfied with the organization, and that 56 percent of frequent air travelers were not satisfied with security. If nearly three-fifths of the people who dealt with a company on a regular basis found it dissatisfactory, it surely would have trouble staying in business. Why does TSA continue to get a pass?
Congressman John Mica, the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, put forth the same question. According to this committee, the average salary of a TSA employee at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. sits at six figures, and reports questioning the efficacy of the organization’s expensive training procedures are becoming more and more numerous. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly common to see TSA in the news for failing to do its job: This September there were multiple incidents where loaded guns got through TSA security unnoticed, according to ABC News.
It is no secret that in the upcoming year, the federal government needs to cut spending. With an average budget of more than $8 billion, TSA should be one of the government agencies carefully examined. It goes without saying that maintaining airport security is crucial, but TSA’s shortcomings and failures are too obvious to keep ignoring.
Opt-Out Week is a good start, but more direct action is needed. It is time for the government to seriously re-evaluate — and perhaps even look at eliminating — the Transportation Security Administration.

Security and Safety are always excessive until it’s not enough.
This article is poorly written.  It meerly restates what others wrote and does not contain any hard driving facts.  Hopefully Mat Goldstien, the undeclared Sophmore, will take another major.  I sure hope our tax dollars are not supplementing his education writing junk articles about a federal agency he knows nothing about.   Lets have an article written by  a fellow journalist of Sophmore Goldstein tackle the abuse of the studen loan system in which the American taxpayer is on the hook to pay tuition for frivilious degrees that provide nothing to our economic system or make our nation stronger.  That is one way to save a few billion and let people into school that have a desire to make the country better rather than finding ways to mooch off the public and stir up debate worthy of a beauty salon audience…
Ad hominem makes you look just as pathetic, if not more.
TSA is beyond reform. If you had to? Scrap the feel-ups and full-on whole-body X-ray imaging.
Go back to walkthrough metal detectors.
Return the US to some semblance of freedom to travel and the 4th Amendment.
The cockpit doors are locked, folks. 9/11 can’t happen again.
