Grocery workers at Ralphs, Vons, Albertsons and Pavilions ratified a three-year contract Sunday with their employer, Stater Bros., which includes significant wage increases, improved healthcare benefits and secured pension provisions. The deal applies to the Ralphs workers at the Vermont Avenue and West Adams Boulevard store, which many USC community members frequent to buy groceries and other supplies. 
Members of United Food and Commercial Workers Locals 8GS, 135, 324, 770, 1167 and 1428 voted April 4 in favor of the deal. The Union represents 40,000 Vons, Ralphs and Albertsons workers whose contracts ended March 6. The unionized workers planned to strike ahead of the negotiations, but the favorable conditions presented at the table negated a strike from happening. Target and Trader Joe’s, both located in the USC Village, were not affected by the negotiations and contract. 
Shyli Akhare, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said she was worried about a potential strike creating slowdowns in grocery stores.
“I would say that I think it’s a good thing that they’re advocating for the rights, and I feel like it’s about time that some change happens in the community,” Akhare said.
Mackenzie Martin, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said that because of the high cost of living in Los Angeles, she believes that workers should be paid a reasonable wage amount. 
“I think that inventory might be low, and it might be harder for us to get any customer service when we are shopping, but I feel like the protests are necessary and it’s for the greater good,” Martin said.
Contract negotiations date back to March 7. Six UFCW locals said in a statement Saturday that the unification of its members secured a historic contract for a “fair deal.” UFCW represents and advocates for workers in healthcare, retail, grocery, packing and cannabis.
In a statement made by Ralphs, the company stated its three goals in negotiations with the union: reward workers, keep groceries affordable for customers and maintain a sustainable business model for an expanding workforce. 
Homero Vasquez, a Ralphs worker on Vermont Boulevard, said the “not good part” has been waiting for payments.
“It’s kind of good just because we’re gonna get a bit better pay,” Vasquez said. “The thing is that we got to wait to get the full amount.”
Robert Branton, vice president of operations at Ralphs, said the company is pleased with the agreement because it will secure money in 18,000 associates’ paychecks, protect healthcare and create effective pension plans.
Pio Figueroa, a worker at the same Ralphs as Vasquez, noted that when the contract terms were first released, the provisions were not adequate. He believed that for the hard work grocery workers do all day, they deserve higher wages and healthcare benefits. Figueroa said he is satisfied with the terms finalized in the ratified contract.
“There was definitely a fight back and forth and negotiation table, but we’re definitely proud to be where we’re at,” Figueroa said. “That was only possible from all the hard work that we’re doing in the stores, all the organizing and all the communications that we’ve been doing with our coworkers.”
Union workers made signs for a looming strike at UFCW 77 Headquarters located in Koreatown Saturday. Workers wanted $5 raises and were met with a 60-cent counteroffer. 
Figueroa said communication between workers to unite was mostly done through a special credit union representative. He visited the three different stores throughout Orange County and spoke with coworkers about better contract provisions. 
“When these terms come into effect, this will definitely set a gold standard for what other contracts are negotiated throughout the country,” Figueroa said. “I think this definitely sets the standard for what’s possible with contracts not only in the grocery industry, but industries throughout the country. We really prove that anything is possible especially when we organize and we get united.”

Early this month, the USC Mock Trial program advanced to the 2022 Mock Trial National Championships, competing in a network of over 400 collegiate programs to face the highest-scoring teams in the country. The National Championships were held in Lancaster County, Pa., from April 8 to 10, with Harvard University clinching a first-place victory and the University of Chicago finishing as the runner-up. In the competition, the teams were responsible for arguing a case about a drug overdose.
The USC Mock Trial program’s success began early this semester with the regional competition, where the team earned three separate bids to advance to the Opening Round Championship Series, when the maximum a program is allowed to use is two.
“That was already incredible, starting off the competitive season like that,” said Logan Barth, a member of the program and a freshman majoring in law, history and culture. 
Team members have attended rigorous practice sessions since joining the team in Fall 2021 to prepare for the slate of regional and opening round competitions throughout the spring. This involved twice-weekly classes, scrimmages on the weekends and additional individual practice to improve courtroom performance, often reaching 25 hours of practice per week. 
During the competitive season leading up to their advancement to Nationals, the team started meeting every day to hone their skills. Members preparing for the Lancaster tournament, including Joanna Ge, a junior studying accounting and business administration, saw the investment of time and effort as key factors to their success.
“You won’t do well in the real competition without getting yourself exposed to the real competition setting in scrimmages, because simply having your script written down is not enough,” Ge said. “It’s really important that you deliver it well in front of the jury or the judges, especially. That’s what you do in real court.”
The team was first created in 2001 by coach Olu Orange, a top rated civil rights attorney, and includes four assistant legal coaches — Chris Bloom, Mikayla Wasiri, Hooman Kazemi and Brittnee Bui — who guide participants closely and provide specific sets of comments to members to improve before the next tournament. The first two years that the team entered competitions, they won first place trophies at national tournaments.
Yet beyond the surface of an award-winning team exists another component in the Mock Trial course: to give students real-world legal experience through public interest advocacy. Many of the opportunities offered within the undergraduate program are not accessible to many students at law school level, and are specific to the Mock Trial class, said Ambika Nuggihalli, a team member and a senior majoring in communications.
Program members have the opportunity to participate in several prominent civil rights cases, both in and out of the Los Angeles area. During the ongoing immigration crisis at the United States-Mexico border, the team made several trips to Harlingen, Texas to train immigration lawyers to go to trial and fairly represent individuals facing deportation. 
Through the public interest advocacy branch, the Mock Trial team has also embarked on assisting on the Black Lives Matter class action lawsuit for mistreatment of protestors in the summer of 2020. Nuggihalli assisted on the case by putting together trial documents, scouring for video footage of protestors to create timelines and making graphics to be used by attorneys in the trial. 
“Undergraduate students being able to get involved with this kind of work, being able to make change and be trusted to do work at this level is a big deal,” Nuggihalli said. “A lot of times, people will tell you that if you want to get into law, it’ll take you a long time to actually make a difference, but that’s not the case with USC trial advocacy. If you want to make a difference, you can do it right now and you can be a part of the bigger picture right now.”

One of the first jobs Liliana Aragon’s grandmother had after arriving in the United States from Guatemala in the 1990s was cleaning dormitories at USC. Almost 30 years later, Aragon will begin attending USC, where she will major in civil engineering with an emphasis in building science as a part of the University’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program. 
“It’s very sentimental,” Aragon said. “Being able to tell [my grandmother] that’s where I’m going to be is very meaningful to me.”
Aragon is one of 8,198 students admitted into the University’s class of 2026. With 69,000 applicants, this year’s acceptance rate was 11.88%. This is the first time the acceptance rate has been lower than 12% since 2019 — a decrease from 12.41% in 2021 and 15.8% in 2020. The number of applicants decreased slightly from last year’s record number of 70,971. In 2020, a significantly lower number of students applied: less than 60,000. 
“Each year, there’s a sense of renewal as we welcome what we hope will be our newest scholars,” said Kedra Ishop, vice president for enrollment management in an interview with USC News. “We’re seeing some of the university’s long-term efforts toward access and inclusion pay off. Financial aid and a holistic approach to our process are key to that success.”
In a process that took more than 30,000 hours and five months of evaluation, 65 employees from USC’s Office of Admission reviewed each of the 69,000 applications.
Adelyn Ledbetter, who will be majoring in English next year, saw her acceptance letter in the applicant portal after consistently checking online forums for release times. 
“It was a bunch of joy and excitement after that,” Ledbetter said. “Just calls from my relatives because my mom texted all of them; it was a good feeling.”
When Cardin Chung, who will be majoring in dance, found out his portal was updated, he had a different approach.
“I hid in the bathroom for two hours and refused to look at my email,” Chung said. “Then, I finally got the guts to open the portal and everyone was surrounding me, and we opened it and saw the confetti and we all just exploded screaming around the house.” 
The interdisciplinary health and human sciences major drew Jessica Silverman, a 2022 admit from Bergen County, N.J., to USC. 
“I definitely screamed, definitely ugly cried,” Silverman said. “It was my top-choice college, it really always has been, so it was such an incredible moment.”
Along with Aragon, who is from San Diego, 38% of admitted students call California home, followed by New York, Texas, Washington — Chung and Ledbetter’s home state — Illinois and Florida. In 2020 and 2021, 40% of admitted students were from California. 
One in five of the admitted students this year is a first generation college student. This is comparable to last year’s figure of 20% and 2020’s figure of 17%. 
Nine percent of admitted students are Black, compared to 8% in 2021. USC News did not report the percentage of 2022 Latinx admits. In 2021, they reported that 18% of admits were Latinx, an increase from the year before. The University reported that three out of four admitted students identify as Black, Latinx, Native American, Asian and Pacific Islander or having multiple ethnicities. 
International student admits increased to 18%, 4% higher than in 2020 and 2021. The most represented countries were China, India, Canada, South Korea and Brazil. 
The University accepted 28 students from the Bovard Scholars program, a USC initiative for high-achieving high school seniors who demonstrate financial need to be admitted into top universities around the country. Last year, the University accepted 44 applicants from the program.
The Leslie and William McMorrow Neighborhood Academic Initiative — a USC organization that supports students in college access and early literacy programs in Los Angeles — boasted 43 applicants this year, a 19-person decrease from last year. 
When Aragon visited their cousin — who goes to USC — they saw USC’s spirit first hand, which inspired them to apply. 
“I went to a water polo game against Cal, and the energy was insane … Everything about it felt very family-oriented,” Aragon said. “USC has such amazing spirit, and I really wanted to be a part of it.”
Chung has already started connecting with fellow incoming freshmen in his major and looks forward to strengthening these connections in the fall. 
“I got to see the work they put out already, and it looks absolutely incredible,” he said. “Being able to be in the same classroom with people and learning from them is really inspiring to me and it gets me really, really excited.”

Feel the heat? Summer is nearly here — but have no fear. The perfect K-pop playlist will refresh you with a splash of popping melodies. 
This summer is special as we reach the much-awaited postpandemic era. Two years ago, the world was put on hold, canceling trips and dashing potential sunny memories. We may have blasted our speakers and closed our eyes to envision the salty breeze of the beach or a warming ray of sunshine, but these fantasies faded away as stolen dreams when the pandemic stayed.
Alas, we are looking at a brighter summer, and it isn’t just because of the blinding sun. It’s the season of hope and new beginnings, perfect for the joyful sounds of K-pop.
“Travel” by BOL4
Summer is the season for a trip, right? Put on this track by BOL4, set down your phone and responsibilities and embrace the exciting warmth of adventure and youthful energy. We all deserve a break after the lengthy pandemic that’s entrapped us within the walls of our rooms. It’s time to roam London, Paris and New York City to explore your potentials out in the depths of the world.
“Red Flavor” by Red Velvet
Bring back the beat of sweet summer tunes with the energetic melodies of Red Velvet. Their powerful vocals singing of the passionate sensation of love and summer to flush away the heatwave. One of the perks of K-pop is powerful choreography, and this track’s accompanying routine grabs you out from under the lethargic heat. Also, check out this song’s music video, bursting with vibrant colors of fresh fruit and icy cocktails. 
“Love Maze” by BTS
How can there be a K-pop listicle without BTS? “Butter” and “Dynamite” are energetic classics, but “Love Maze” lays back a calming beat with more serene vocals singing of the warmest forms of love. The soft melody holds your hand through the dark and complex love maze, promising a lighted paradise up ahead. In times of doubt and faltering self-belief, BTS is by your side to sing words of reassurance that “Love is a maze, but you is amaze.”
“Hola Hola” by KARD
It’s not every day that you find a wondrous mix of vocals supporting the perfect California vibe. KARD is a co-ed group, not common in K-pop, that depicts the flutters of playing hard to get in a summer fling. The lyrics swerve past the clichéd romantics of a droning love song and dig deeper into the heartaches of a midsummer night’s dream.
“Our Summer” by TOMORROW X TOGETHER
Step into the magical realm of TXT’s playground memories. While “We Lost The Summer” may call for the lost summer with friends and family during the pandemic, it’s time to go back to this nostalgic album and reach toward postpandemic hope. A hazy vision of nostalgia brought on by simple emotions of innocence and joy immerses you in TXT’s interpretation of summer. Their angelic vocals sing various renditions of the golden season that calls the sapphire blue sea to wash over the boring gray buildings of the city. 
“Ah Puh” by IU
How can we pass the summer without a song about the beach? IU takes you on a mesmerizing journey into the waves with her elegant vocals in this rhythmic bop, and no one articulates the perfect concoction of onomatopoeia and melodic splashes better than she does. Her voice paints pastel-colored sunsets and adorable attempts to tackle the menacing waves. A further look into the lyrics unveils a deeper understanding of growth and moving forward against the spontaneous waves, no matter how menacing they may turn out to be. 
“Dinosaur” by AKMU
The sweet innocence of childhood frames a beautiful story behind this EDM hit. AKMU tells the tale of a dinosaur that manifested a young boy’s nightmare one summer night. This sibling duo sings to their childhood creature that unfolds into a magical fantasy through clear vocals elegantly painting the night sky with a dash of sparkling stars.
Whether it be an energetic bop to soundtrack a run to the beach or a calming melody to relax with in the afternoon sun, don’t let this summer go without the beautiful serenade of a song.

The “Black Menaces,” as they call themselves, are a group of Black students at Brigham Young University who go around the university asking students questions on politically polarizing issues. Some of these divisive topics include Black Lives Matter, same-sex marriage and abortion laws. 
Their goal is stated in a pinned video on their TikTok account: “to highlight the reality of Black students and other marginalized communities.”
 Since “The Black Menaces” posted their first video in February — during Black History Month — they have gained 617.3K followers. Most of their videos have over 1 million views and the ones that don’t still have hundreds of thousands, a huge accomplishment in just a few short months.
The student creators all have their own reason for starting the “Black Menaces.”
“We want to reform what the word menaces means, right?” one student said. “Nobody that ever accomplished any real reform was like a hero in the eyes of society.”
Overall, the account has come to highlight the reality of Black students at a predominantly white, religious institution such as BYU — an experience rarely shared with such a large audience. 
According to their mission, BYU was “founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.”
Located in Provo, Utah, the state with the highest population of LDS members, it is undeniable many of the students would hold more conservative that are in line with the church. 
Student demographics also paint a picture of what campus beliefs and ideas might look like. 81% of the student body is white while less than 1% is Black. 
With all of this in mind, it is not surprising that most but not all of the responses to questions like “Do you support Black Lives Matter?” or “Do you think the Confederate flag is racist?” are disappointing. 
Regardless of the responses to these questions, the most appalling videos are those where students and, more importantly, professors are unable to identify pictures of historical Black figures such as Rosa Parks. 
It highlights just how much the United States school system is failing children. Parks, Martin Luther King Jr. and other Civil Rights activists are people I remember learning about as young as kindergarten. However, with recent national debates over critical race theory, we are seeing that education systems within counties and states are biased towards majority beliefs. 
While people are entitled to their own thoughts, opinions and beliefs, it is hard to understand the opposite side’s priorities when it means that they are bigots towards people. 
The “Black Menances” give outsiders a rare, unfiltered look into the prejudice and blindness that microcosms of religion and whiteness cause certain Americans to have. While shocking to see, their experiences at BYU give a small glimpse into the beliefs that a large population across the country have. 
I am sure that many of the answers the “Black Menances” receive are not easy for them to hear, but they are not quick to judge those people or start a debate. They know that their work amplifying Black voices is more important, and for that, they deserve all the success they are receiving.

At the end of BTS’s first show of their four-show Las Vegas residency, each member of the group stood in front of their thousands of fans and gave their ending “ment” speeches. Like the six other members, leader RM explicitly mentioned another event the group attended while they were in Las Vegas: the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awards. 
“We’ve heard all of the stuff about the GRAMMYs, why give a shit about it? Let the haters hate, let the lovers love. We didn’t come to Vegas for the GRAMMYs, we came for the ARMYs,” RM said in his speech, referencing the group’s fandom name. 
It was an interesting statement on RM’s part, considering their performance at the award show was a mere five days before and that they’ve spent years chasing this honor — in a 2018 interview with Jimmy Fallon, rapper Suga said the group’s next move would be to “go to the GRAMMYs.” 
The group has gotten close to the achievement multiple times. In 2018, their album “Love Yourself: Tear” was nominated for Best Recording Package, a category that honors a physical album’s artwork, followed by two nominations for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance in 2021 and 2022, for “Dynamite” and “Butter,” respectively. 
Yet, it’s confusing that despite how successful both singles were on the charts — “Dynamite” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and “Butter” had the biggest song debut ever on Spotify, with over 11 million global streams — neither track was able to secure the group a win. 
It’s also important to note that both of these songs were performed fully in English, a move I never thought BTS would make. In a 2017 “On Air with Ryan Seacrest” interview, when a fan asked if the group would ever produce an all-English album, RM responded sarcastically, “Thanks for the good advice. You should definitely come to our label and work with us.” 
I’ve always had mixed feelings about BTS’s all-English songs. Don’t get me wrong, I think that the remixes of their originally Korean language songs with American superstars, including Nicki Minaj, Lauv and Sia, are strategic and were great ways for them to expand their American fanbase without sacrificing their roots. 
But, in all honesty, that’s what their all-English songs feel like to me: sacrificial. 
Beyond the language though, BTS’s all-English songs even adopt music video concepts with references to American culture: retro donut shops in “Dynamite,” McDonald’s advertisement-esque shots in “Butter” and Western-inspired outfits in “Permission to Dance.”
It’s really hard for me to watch BTS essentially push their culture aside, clearly reflected in the language in which they sing, in an attempt to secure validation from the American music industry. I detest the fact that BTS hasn’t performed on a weekly Korean music show since they promoted “ON” in February 2020. I hate the fact that BTS thinks they have to sacrifice such an integral part of their identity for validation from the American music industry.
And yet, despite my frustration, a part of me does understand why the group is making some of these choices.
In an industry dominated by white executives, it makes sense that a song performed in English would have a better shot at winning a GRAMMY than a song performed in a foreign language. It sadly makes sense that the group and their company seem to think that the only way BTS will be able to win a GRAMMY is by submitting to the norms and standards of those who have the power to give them one. 
In no way do I mean to invalidate BTS’s desire for a GRAMMY, or the methods that they’re taking to earn one. But after their second failed attempt at a GRAMMY, maybe RM was on the right track with his speech at that concert on Friday: “Why give a shit about it?” Clearly, the thousands of ARMY seeing BTS at their four sold-out shows in Las Vegas don’t, and neither should they.

Growing up, Sham1016 recalls listening to whatever music dropped on Tuesdays when his uncle would pick him up after school. It created a foundation for the type of music he enjoyed; he cites musicians such as Tupac, Kendrick Lamar, Missy Elliot and Jodeci. Such artists instilled in him the importance of versatility and inspired him to make music about any topic he wants to explore.
A rapper hailing from South Central Los Angeles, Sham has been working on his craft for the past six years. After deciding to focus on music full-time in 2016, he has developed a lengthy and honed catalog — but he isn’t just involved in music. He’s also a graphic designer and part owner of Blacker the Berry Juicery, a juice company he and his partner, Dominique Burrell, started back in 2018. In all of his creative pursuits, he seeks to empower his community. 
Repping Vermont Avenue in South L.A., Sham recounts his upbringing as one filled with family, friends and a sense of community but also marked by violence and incarceration. His connection to the community is almost second nature, he said, one which has rewarded him with countless opportunities.
“Growing up in L.A., you’re going to have a sense of pride,” Sham said. “Specifically the block that you grew up in, the hood you grew up in, the community that you grew up in … You always want to make sure you’re doing something for your community and where you come from, that’s ingrained in us … You want to put on for the people that represent that.”
Sham has already reached enormous milestones in his rap career — he’s proud of going on tour with prominent L.A. rapper Bino Rideaux and having his song, “Internet Bangers,” played on the “L.A. Leakers” radio show. But despite his popular success, he’s most proud of how his music is being received by the L.A. youth. 
“Even with the [song] ‘Play Ball,’ one of my close homies, he works in the juvenile system, [told me that] the kids heard it, and you know, these are kids that did some shit in the streets, but they’re reciting my shit,” Sham said. “I’m talking about you got enemies from different hoods that don’t fuck with each other, shaking hands and reciting the lines … that’s bigger than a GRAMMY.” 
He plans to work with his engineer to provide local kids with the necessary equipment for them to create music. For Sham, being able to have a positive impact on his community is an essential pillar of his career.
Being community oriented is just how Sham does business. For the music video to his song “Play Ball,” his first instinct was to get in touch with local video producer Ten Fifty. The Inglewood-based producer recalls first working with Sham a year after they met while shooting a podcast for a mutual friend and being drawn to the rapper’s creativity and love for his neighborhood during their first collaboration.
“[Sham] said ‘Well, we’re gonna go to this corner spot … I just wanna make sure we get this corner of the block, I wanna make sure we get this street sign,’” Ten Fifty said.
With Sham’s only requirement being to highlight the Vermont Square street sign, Ten Fifty was given creative liberty to decide what else to add for the video. Ten Fifty remembers some of the initial difficulties he had when working on the video, trying to match Sham’s ever-evolving track with dynamic visuals. He ultimately gathered inspiration from the various instrumentals Sham flipped in the song, deciding to pay homage to those original songs’ music videos to create something new.
“I took those ideas of how they colored it and how they shot it and just applied it to my video,” Ten Fifty said. “Without looking into those videos, it probably just would have been a simple good quality video, but not as creative as it turned out to be without [us] thinking at the moment, ‘All right, what [are we] going to do with this?’”
As reflected by “Play Ball,” Sham’s pursuits seek to flip and share his favorite parts of life with his community. That philosophy also extends to Blacker the Berry Juicery. He and Burrell began the juice business with a goal: to extend some of their favorite healthy drinks to every corner of L.A., where marginalized communities are often deprived of affordable options.
It’s not just L.A.’s food deserts they focused on. The business also looks to bring awareness to the insufficient food options in the United States prison system, and works to provide better options for incarcerated people. 
“Blacker the Berry Juicery is a plant-based social justice construct addressing food insecurity and food apartheid within disadvantaged communities,” Burrell said. “Two of our long-term goals is to collect data to advocate for legislation and change the laws associated with prison food to provide [those incarcerated] with healthier options. But, we are also using that data to allow us to target our food and juice options to [the disadvantaged] audience.” 
Both Sham and Burrell come from areas that offer little access to healthy food — L.A. and Richmond, Va., respectively. Both see that this issue isn’t just around their homes, but is widespread throughout the U.S. Additionally, both have family and friends who were or are incarcerated, and much of what they’ve heard is that the food in the prison system is “awful.” 
“Just because people are incarcerated [or] in jail — sometimes they’re not even guilty of the crimes that they’re in there for — that doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t have a healthier food option,” Sham said. “The best that they’re going to get is a V8 juice, and most of that is sugar.” 
As if Sham’s life wasn’t busy enough, he released an album on April 8 titled “Foul Play” following up his February release of the lead single “Hurt Yourself.” He said he feels that his latest project has something special about it — beside the potential to catapult him into people’s playlists.
“With ‘Foul Play’ you should expect greatness, just a level up,” Sham said. “It’s better than ‘Everybody’s Enemy’ … Don’t expect it to be what you expect from an L.A. artist.”

No. 17 Trojans are hitting the road this weekend to play against fellow Pac-12 opponents Colorado and Oregon. 
Both games will be rematches, with the Trojans prevailing in the prior games by a score of 11-7 versus the Buffaloes and 21-5 versus the Ducks. 
After a 23-17 loss to Stanford Sunday, the Trojans look to get back on track with two conference matchups. USC is currently 5-2 in its Pac-12 games with the sole two losses coming against Stanford. 
Head Coach Lindsey Munday has always established a “focus on us” mentality for her team and explained that each game is a new challenge, despite their previous wins against Colorado and Oregon. 
“I think constant communication about what you want the program to be and how we want our mentality to be. I think it’s easy to steer away from that and look at who you’re playing next and rankings and other teams,” Munday said. “But at the end of the day, you just want to control what you can control, and that’s how hard you work, and that’s getting better every single day and focusing on us.”
The Buffaloes, like the Trojans, are 9-3 on the season, boasting an impressive win against Stanford. They are 4-3 in the conference and are looking to make the jump past USC with a win. 
USC is 2-3 in its last five matchups against the Buffaloes. In the team’s last game versus Colorado, graduate student midfielder Kelsey Huff carried the Trojans on attack with 7 goals and a hat trick within the first seven minutes of play. The other 4 goals all came in the first half from freshman attacker Isabelle Vitale, sophomore midfielder Madison Waters and junior attacker Ella Heaney. 
As for the Buffaloes, fifth year attacker Sam McGee scored a hat trick for the Buffs in the previous matchup, while four other players each were able to score past USC goalie Kait Devir. 
USC has scored at least 11 points in every game this year, with Colorado holding the Trojans to the fewest points scored in a game this season. 
On the opposite end of the spectrum, USC registered its highest total against Oregon. In their last matchups, the Trojans defeated the Ducks 21-5. The game marked career highs for many players, including sophomore attacker Shelby Tilton and Vitale, who had 4 goals apiece. Freshman attacker Nicole Fanelli scored the first 2 goals of her career, and graduate midfielder Kelsey Huff registered her 28th career hat trick. 
On the defensive end, senior defender Kaleigh Brennan caused 2 turnovers and 2 ground balls, while freshman midfielder Catherine Lord recovered 3 ground balls and caused 1 turnover. Defense will certainly play a key role in these next games, especially against Oregon, who edged the Trojans on draw controls last time out. 
Junior defender Danielle Carson said that following the Stanford game, the team is working hard to get back on course. 
“We’re really just working on what each position needs to do … working together and communicating a lot,” Carson said. “After our loss, we’re definitely pumped. We’re really confident that we can get out after them.”
As the Pac-12 Championship comes near, a pair of wins would put the Trojans in a pivotal position for seeding. 
“Our chemistry on the field is awesome,” Carson said. “It’s definitely really showing, and I believe it’s helping our culture: from our fifth years to our freshmen, we’re all super close and we have great relationships.” 
USC will face Colorado at 3 p.m. Friday and Oregon at 1 p.m. Sunday.

We are officially not doing enough to prevent irreversible effects of climate change … again. This is no surprise. The breaking news in the climate world this past week was the publication of the latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This particular report may serve as a final warning as the report’s findings stated that “limiting warming to around 1.5°C (2.7°F) requires global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 at the latest” before irreversible effects of climate change.
Comprised of scientists from around the globe, the IPCC produces a comprehensive review of climate science every six to seven years regarding physical climate science, impacts and adaptations and solutions for cutting emissions to reduce further warming. The official 2022 mitigation report is a 17-chapter publication nearing 3,000 pages. Thankfully, there’s a handy Technical Summary, Summary for Policymakers and brief video recap, all full of the latest and greatest facts and figures that serves as a Sparknotes version of the IPCC. 
Despite the relatively gloomy tone of the report, it offers us a chance to close the gaps between scientific discovery and legitimate public comprehension. Studies have shown that although climate change concern and engagement is growing, it isn’t reflected with more ambitious political action. It’s more important than ever that we find methods of effectively communicating climate information to reflect the legitimate urgency surrounding the situation. A majority of the world does not have a scientific background, and it’s imperative they’re able to fully comprehend the information to fuel collective action. 
In a representative democracy such as our own, the public holds power. It’s crucial that both constituents and policymakers understand the element of variability when it comes to climate science. We can predict outcomes based on data-driven models, but there are still margins of error dependent upon the actions we take in the next few years. 
Scientists know that the sea level is rising, yet how much it will actually rise is highly contingent upon how the world tackles carbon emissions. As a result, it’s understandably difficult to implement legislation with a degree of flexibility, not to mention comprehending that this element of probability doesn’t undermine the seriousness of the situation.
We may all be desensitized to bad climate news at this point, but beneath its technical vocabulary, this IPCC report actually leveraged many different messaging techniques to reach a wider audience, offering social solutions to climate mitigation. It models potential economic impacts of leaving the crisis unaddressed and emphasizes the importance of implementing lifestyle changes to reduce demand. Although the general report findings have been discussed in media coverage, the framing is just as important as the facts. It’s hard for anyone to visualize the ominously described future of our planet with abstract systematic concepts until it’s already upon us. 
All this talk about scientific education and climate urgency begs the question — is it within scientists’ job description to be activists? At this point, climate change has become hopelessly intertwined with political persuasions, yet the scientific conclusions speak for themselves. Activism and critical climate messaging are interchangeable at this point, and the most effective way to spread the message is by diversifying our channels of communication in order to reach as many people as possible.
This IPCC report, while grim, is a step in the right direction — reconciling scientific implications with socioeconomic and political realities requires interdisciplinary analysis, and any sort of investment in the comprehension of constituents is a win for science communication. Maybe repackaging information in various forms doesn’t yield the immediate tangible results that studying global carbon cycles does, but as this report implies, fighting climate change is going to require strong public support and behavioral change. It may take time to see the effects of humanizing the battle against our human-altered landscapes, but climate science needs to be thoroughly understood beyond academia for maximum engagement and action.
Even if scientific communication achieves perfect layman’s terms, there won’t be a sea change in policy making. People constantly want to push the burden onto the next generation — but the conversation needs to enter mainstream media without all the clickbait and apocalyptic headlines. Talking about climate change is unquestionably scary — there’s some element of involuntary denial because it’s essentially impossible to fight nature and win. 
There still is a way forward, but we need to make up for a lot of lost time. This is a phenomenon for which we are collectively responsible and of which will all suffer the repercussions. Regardless of how you look at it, climate messaging needs to incorporate everyone. The data itself is clear, but we have our work cut out for us in making sure that the language we use to describe climate change is just as accessible.

Growing up, my mom hated when I cried. 
Hate is a strong word, but I don’t know what else to call it. If I cried because she yelled at me, she would yell at me even harder because I was crying. Her go-to saying was “You’re crying? I haven’t even given you a reason to cry.”
I could never hide it from her either. After all, my face would get so red and splotchy that I would splash cold water on it just, so she couldn’t tell that I had been crying. This never worked, though. She always caught on. My only saving grace came when I was old enough to wear makeup that could hide the redness.
I’ve spent years processing this, trying to figure out what in her psyche made her believe a young girl needed this type of parenting from her mother. I realize now that I don’t blame her nor do I resent her for it. She viewed this as her form of shaping me to have thick skin, to be as tough as her. To be resilient.
This stripping of fragility and softness is something that I’ve been praised for throughout my entire life. I’ve bristled whenever people have called me resilient, strong, tough, brave or courageous.
I want to tell them that this is what was expected of me. There’s never been one moment in my life where I was afforded the luxury, mercy or kindness of sadness. There was never time to ponder and sit through sorrow — that’s not allowed in my culture. And that’s definitely not allowed in immigrant families. Sadness is considered a selfish choice when there’s the family to worry about. And after all, isn’t hardship part of the American dream?
I wonder if my mom knew ahead of time that it was better to teach me how to shield myself against trauma rather than let it destroy me from within. Given that much of this lecturing occurred when my family was undocumented in the United States, perhaps this was her way of her saying, “Brace yourself. If you think you’re sad now, the worst is yet to come.” 
In fifth grade, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained my dad while he was on his way to work. This happened around 4 a.m. on a weekday, and the memory is permanently branded in my brain.
I woke up because of my grandma loudly pleading to God to save our family from this devastation, while my mom called every relative she knew and asked if they could give her a ride to the detention center in downtown Sacramento or if they knew an immigration lawyer. I never once saw my mom cry about any of this, at least not in front of me or my siblings.
Perhaps a family who wasn’t built so much on toughness would’ve let me stay home from school and find a way to process our worst nightmare unfold before us. Instead, I braided my hair into two strands because abuelita was too busy to do it for me, went off to school arriving sharply on time to eat breakfast in the cafeteria and blamed my tears on fake allergies when my classmates asked about my puffy tear-ridden eyes.
I’ve spent my entire life knowing how to take the worst the world has to throw at me. I’m numb to a lot of things now — so much so that I’ve exploited my own resiliency time and time again for personal gain. I wrote all about my trauma during college application season because I wanted whoever was on the opposite side to know I can overcome any challenges that come my way. “Look at me,” I wanted to say. “If I can handle all of this, I can handle your university. You need someone like me.” 
I’m so tired of this, though. I am so, so, so, so, so tired. I never want to write about that again. I never want to rely on that again. 
I no longer want to carry the burden of being resilient. Resilient is what we label people, especially women of color, who are expected to handle tough situations with gracefulness. No one looks toward dismantling the systems and people who hurt us. Instead, we are awarded pats on the back for surviving.
I long for a life where I’m allowed to feel sad without feeling guilty. I wish I wasn’t conditioned to think that whenever something bad happens to me that the first thing I say to myself is, “There’s someone out there who has it worse,” because I want to detract myself from my pain.
I yearn to be able to fall apart. I crave a world where I don’t have to race to heal myself as quickly as possible. 
I’m not sure if that will ever exist, but at least I hold on to the hope that one day it will. And maybe I’ll finally feel comfortable crying without feeling like I’m letting myself down — red, splotchy face and all.

Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok comprise the three-headed social media monster for Gen Z.  Facebook, Twitter, Tinder, LinkedIn, Pinterest and YouTube are also very popular social networking platforms in their own right. We use these forms of social media to stay connected with friends, entertain ourselves, stay up to date on news, find job opportunities and so much more. With all these different variations and purposes of social media, it is difficult to exclude them from our lives. 
Those in Gen Z spend, on average, 53 minutes per day on Instagram and 50 minutes per day on Snapchat. That means that nearly two hours of our day end up being spent liking posts or sending streaks, so for those who scroll too much, it’s not difficult to understand why a social media detox — when one refrains from using any networking platforms for a set period — would be helpful. 
Typically, detoxes are employed when one becomes addicted, spending an excessive amount of time on social media and can’t stop. However, this reactive approach to detoxes shouldn’t be the only way you should maintain a healthy relationship with social media — they can also be used proactively. 
Social media addiction is rooted in our subconscious. When we see people like, comment and share positivity on our posts, our brains release dopamine, making us feel happy and rewarded. Over time, relying on social media to feel happy holds roots in others’ affirmations and giving us the proverbial thumbs up. Most scarily, we begin to require more validation from social media once we start to rely on it for dopamine. 
A proactive relationship with social media means taking breaks before you get to this extent of reliance, not after. Trying this proactive approach is especially relevant for teenagers, as researchers have found that extensive social media usage opens the door to a host of mental health issues such as social anxiety, social isolation and feelings of loneliness. Taking a break from social media allows us to step away from these dangers.
According to Medical News Today, “researchers saw that users who frequently checked their accounts had a more than twice as high a risk of depression than their less social media-oriented peers.” In terms of a complete detox, there is no set time period that guarantees mental health benefits, as it varies from person to person. However, according to a study from the National Library of Medicine, 37% of students who attempted a detox lasted at least three days and most reported health benefits including better mood and productivity and improved sleep.
During the detox, find ways to keep the mind distracted. It can be anything one desires whether that is learning how to cook, working out, reading a book or spending time with friends. However, a detox should only temporarily prevent or break social media addiction. It is not meant to be permanent. 
Social media has a host of benefits, such as helping people stay connected with friends and family and be in tune with any major events happening around the world. The usage of proactive detoxes help us experience the benefits and limit the pitfalls of social media by limiting our reliance on them.
It’s not about deleting these applications forever. We just need to learn to have a healthy relationship with these platforms.

Pamela McGee’s legacy is the best story in USC basketball history. 
From attending high school in Flint, Mich. to becoming the matriarch of one of basketball’s best families, helping her teams bring championships home is what McGee does. 
McGee burst onto the USC scene after leading her high school team to undefeated seasons in both of her final two years, both of which ended in Michigan state championships. She won those championships alongside her twin sister Paula, a prodigious hooper herself.  
Diehard USC hoops fans should be familiar with what came next. Pamela and Paula both committed to USC and brought their championship winning ways with them. The sensational sisters teamed up with fellow women’s hoops legends Cynthia Cooper and Cheryl Miller to form the swaggiest, most dominant basketball team in USC history. 
The fearsome four won USC’s only hoops national championships in back-to-back years, 1983 and 1984. In a time before the WNBA, those NCAA title teams put women’s basketball on the map in Los Angeles. 
To top it off, Pamela won a gold medal with the USA women’s basketball team at the 1984 Olympics. 
Pamela played out most of her professional career in international leagues, but returned to the U.S. in 1997 as a headlining player in the inaugural WNBA season. She played one season for the Sacramento Monarchs before finishing her career back in L.A. with the Sparks. 
Following her illustrious career, McGee was elected into the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012 and had her No. 30 jersey retired by USC that same year. 
That career makes her one of USC basketball’s greatest. What happened after is what sets her apart in USC hoops lore. 
During her career, McGee gave birth to two children, including her son, JaVale, who currently plays in the NBA. JaVale has won three NBA titles with the Golden State Warriors and L.A. Lakers and has a chance to win another this year with the top-seeded Phoenix Suns. 
Even more remarkably, JaVale won a gold medal during the 2020 Olympics as a member of the USA men’s basketball team. JaVale and Pamela’s golds make them the first mother-son duo in basketball history to win a gold medal each.  
Yet, that is not all. Pamela’s other child, Imani McGee-Stafford, grew up to be a dominant frontcourt player like her mom and brother. She was drafted by the Chicago Sky in the first round of the 2016 WNBA draft, and after sitting out two years to pursue her law degree, she is attempting to return to the Sky after playing in the Athletes Unlimited league. 
If you’re keeping track at home, the McGee’s’ familial feat is a first in history. The McGee family is the first ever with a WNBA mother, an NBA son and a WNBA daughter. Let us not forget that Pamela’s sister, Paula, is also a national champion and USC legend. 
Move over, Lavar Ball. L.A.’s best basketball family has Pamela McGee at the center of it. 
Few people are going to admit that though. It’s unlikely that you’re going to hear the McGee name mentioned amongst other basketball family royalty names like Ball, Curry and Antetokounmpo. 
There’s a simple reason why Pamela won’t get the respect she and her family deserve, and it’s because of a larger problem: People have historically failed to give women’s hoopers the respect they deserve. 
Despite the international popularity of the game of basketball, the WNBA’s fanbase is remarkably small. Because of this, the WNBA actually loses money every year that it operates, and many star players have to play overseas or work odd jobs in the offseason. 
WNBA haters will make excuses about why they are not a fan, but the real reason comes down to the age-old, boy’s club opinion that only men can play sports at the highest level. 
Unfortunately, that means most people weren’t paying attention when Pamela McGee was winning championships while raising championship-caliber kids. 
As a single mother for much of her life, McGee was one of the women’s players who had to work other jobs in the offseason to help raise her kids, including part time teaching jobs, yet another underappreciated occupation. Maintaining her career while pouring into her kids is quite an amazing feat. 
It’s unfortunately too late to watch Pamela play basketball. However, we can still appreciate what she did for the WNBA and basketball as a whole and celebrate her accomplishments as a parent by cheering on her children. 
So when you watch JaVale throw down dunks in the NBA playoffs or see Imani balling her way back to the WNBA, think of Pamela.  
After all, we in the Trojan family love other successful families.

Baseball is preparing for its upcoming three-game away series against Arizona State April 14-16. The Trojans currently sit at a 4-8 conference record and 18-12 overall.
The team comes off a 16-10 win against Cal State University, Northridge, where USC put up six homers on the board from five different batters. Redshirt sophomore Adrian Colon-Rosado had two, one in each of the first two innings. 
Head Coach Jason Gill said he felt that the Trojans showed up despite the tough weather conditions.
“The wind was blowing pretty hard, and I thought our pitchers did well all the way up until that ninth inning and then holding them down to 5 runs prior to that,” said Gill in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “The defense played well and obviously, we came at the bat, so it’s a good deal.”
Colon-Rosado’s three-run shot to right field in the first inning sparked the Trojans’ homerun rally. His second home run was the third of the second inning, following sophomore infielder D’Andre Smith and redshirt sophomore infielder/outfielder Tyrese Turner’s solo home runs. 
Colon-Rosado leads the team with the highest batting average of .387, 41 hits and 27 runs. 
“I think if you were going to say one of them is the biggest surprise, it would probably be [Colon-Rosado] just because he didn’t have a body of work coming into the season,” Gill said. “This is the first time he’s really gotten an opportunity to play.”  
Next on the leaderboard is Turner with a .321 batting average, 36 hits and 22 runs. Thomas sits close behind with a .320 batting average, 39 hits and 19 runs. The three players have shouldered the load on offense this season. 
Next up for the Trojans is Arizona State, who will host the Pac-12 series against USC at the Phoenix Municipal Stadium. The Sun Devils have a 5-7 conference record and a 15-19 overall record. 
Arizona State enters the series on a high after a blowout 21-1 win against Santa Clara. The Sun Devils racked up 22 hits with key offensive plays from redshirt sophomores outfielder Joe Lampe, infielder Sean McLain, catcher Nate Baez and freshman infielder Cam Magee — all four players had 3 hits. 
Grad student infielder Conor Davis leads the hosts in batting average with a .339 average, 43 hits and 24 runs. Redshirt sophomore outfielder Joe Lampe tops the leaderboard with the most hits at 47 hits and 145 at-bats. 
“I think that the pitching staff in general is going to have thick skin because there are gonna be balls that, in Southern California, would be routine fly balls but are gonna leave the yard [in Arizona],” Gill said. “You just gotta get back out there and continue to throw strikes.” 
The last time the Trojans faced the Sun Devils, USC fell short in a 10-7 loss. Gill said he wants the pitching staff to tighten up on allowing walks.
“I think what kills you the most, and you saw it yesterday [at Northridge], is free bases,” Gill said. “Anywhere you go, you don’t wanna walk anyone, but I think when you go into ballparks like Arizona State, you gotta try to play real tight defense and not walk anybody.”
Arizona State will host the Pac-12 series against the Trojans at the Phoenix Municipal Stadium. The first pitch is set for Thursday at 6:30 p.m.
