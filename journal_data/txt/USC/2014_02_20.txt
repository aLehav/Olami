A Los Angeles Police Department vehicle pursuit occurred along campus Thursday night, resulting in the arrest of the assailant at University Gate 3 on Figueroa Street. and 34th Street.
The pursuit originated on Figueroa Street after LAPD attempted to stop a stolen car, according to Department of Public Safety  Deputy Chief David Carlisle. The driver then entered campus through Gate 5 on Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue where the chase continued.
The pursuit ended after the driver was not able to make a turn at the gate on Figueroa Street and 34th Street.
“The suspect entered campus at gate 5 and drove east on 34th Street,” Carlisle said. “The suspect was captured when he was forced to stop at the tram gate at 34th Street and Figueroa.”
The driver is now in police custody.
Holly cow,
Can we not get a hold of this problem? USC is the wild west–guns blazing. Bad bad bad neighborhood, bad neighborhood.
Really? A stolen car (that happens literally anywhere — people steal cars in Podunk Alabama just as much as they steal them in downtown Santa Monica) gets onto campus and your response is “bad bad bad neighborhood”? If anything, I commend LAPD and DPS for their efforts in nabbing the guy. I was on campus at the time, walking down 34th street — this car sped past and there were students all around. Thankfully, nobody was hurt, and DPS worked with LAPD to secure the campus perimeter amazingly fast.

On Thursday afternoon, USC students and faculty gathered to hear Leon Aron, resident scholar and director of Russian studies at the American Enterprise Institute, discuss the political, security and climate problems surrounding the Winter Olympics during a talk entitled “Sochi 2014: The Most Dangerous Olympics in History?”
Skype’n in · American Enterprise Institute director of Russian studies Leon Aron spoke on his worries about the Sochi Olympics via Skype. – Macaul Hodge | Daily Trojan
 
The American Enterprise Institute is a think tank which many consider to be conservative.
“The list of things that could go wrong is huge, especially for the Winter Olympics,” Aron said.
Aron, who spoke via Skype from Washington D.C., pointed out that every year the Olympics is plagued by four distinct risks: weather, public protests, venue malfunctions and terrorism.
“Each of these four factors has been magnified in Sochi,” he said.
Aron said that Sochi is one of the warmest places in Russia. He mentioned that sports events have been canceled in this area in previous years due to rain and weather constraints. Aron said the “slushy” snow conditions provided by Sochi could cause a higher number of Olympic injuries to participants than usual.
“Putting your Olympics in the subtropics is clearly one [danger],” Aron said. “It’s the doubling of the poker bet.”
Aron also addressed the possibility of structural issues and construction defects due to Russia’s labor conditions and the “mad rush to finish” on time for the games.
“I’m willing to bet that there has not been a Winter Olympics game in history where the gap between what was there and what was needed was so huge,” he said.
In preparation for the games, Aron said that Sochi built a new airport, seaport, 70 bridges, 12 tunnels and hundreds of miles of roads and railroad tracks.
“Hence the enormous price tag,” Aron said. “It’s estimated that it cost over $50 billion.”
Due to political corruption and negative labor conditions, Aron believes that many of the new buildings might not be structurally safe.
“So far, thank God, nothing collapsed, nothing happened,” he said. “However, we shall see.”
Aron also mentioned the danger of public protests that turn violent. He identified two groups — LGBT and Circassians — as potential protestors. He said, however, that not many protests have happened so far because of the permits required to get close to the games.
“But, perhaps the greatest gamble that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin took is the gamble of terrorism,” Aron said.
“Sochi is not only the warmest place in Russia, it’s literally over the mountain from the most dangerous zone in Russia, actually the fourth most dangerous place in the world … [for] terrorism,” Aron said.
Aron noted the current bombings and terrorist actions that are currently taking place in response to this topic as proof for the danger Sochi poses to the Olympic Games. He also added that he believes Putin chose a location so close to the dangers of terrorism to show Russia’s strength.
“To him, putting the Olympics next door to the troubles north [of the] Caucasian area, to the center of terrorism, was very important, because that signified his personal triumph,” Aron said. “As it turned out, de facto, he did not succeed because there is increasing terrorist activity there.”
Throughout his speech, Aron underlined the role that the Russian president and Russian autocrats had in placing the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.
“Make no mistakes about this,” Aron said. “There is only one person who makes decisions of this scale in Russia. And that is the president.”
Kyron Jacques, a sophomore majoring in public relations, thought that Aron brought up                              thought-provoking political points about the Olympics that many media outlets ignore.
“It will be interesting to see what Russia and Putin’s reputations are after the games, and if something does happen, what it will mean for future games,” he said.
The event was sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute at USC and the USC Russian Culture Club.
Aron is the author of three books, and more than 300 articles and essays. He has been a contributing writer for The New York Times and The Washington Post and researches U.S. and Russian relations, Russian foreign policy and Russia in the     post-Soviet era.

On Thursday, GlobeMed at USC recognized the World Day of Social Justice by educating and inspiring students about the myths on poverty.
Tagging · Sophia Nagar, a freshman majoring in theatre, spray paints “laughter” near Tommy Trojan as part of World Day of Social Justice. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed Feb. 20 as the World Day of Social Justice in 2007. On that day, UN member states support efforts of the international community to eradicate poverty, promote work and employment, gender equality and access to social well-being for all.
GlobeMed, a national organization with branches on more than 50 university campuses across the country, partners at USC with Care Net Ghana to support women’s and children’s health and human rights. Each of GlobeMed’s university chapters has an initiative to engage its campus on social justice issues.
At USC, a graffiti project pointed out the contrast between a socially just world and the world in which we live. Members of GlobeMed at USC asked students a type of social justice they though everyone should have a right to, and students spray painted their answers on a large board.
GlobeMed at USC focused on debunking three myths. The 2014 Gates Annual Letter, published in January by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, described “3 Myths that Block Progress for the Poor.” Club leaders educated about the myths that poor countries are doomed to stay poor, that aid is a big waste and that saving lives leads to overpopulation.
By combatting these myths, poor countries have hope for development.
As GlobeMed titled its event “Pop That Myth,” each time a student learned a fact, he or she popped a balloon on the side of the board.
The goal was to raise awareness about social justice and the question of what everyone deserves in the world.
USC GlobeMed member Lucy Ruderman was excited to able to reach out to students not directly affiliated with her program.
“I think it’s incredible to have such strong student advocates who genuinely care about bettering the world beyond our campus,” Ruderman said. “It was really cool to be able to engage other students outside of GlobeMed with World Day of Social Justice.”
In the future, USC GlobeMed will continue working with Care Net Ghana in a local project to help fund a medical laboratory and an ultrasound scan. The new equipment in the facilities will allow for timely and accurate diagnoses of complicated pregnancies and reduce maternal and infant mortality in the area.
Last year, they trained 100 volunteers from 20 villages in the Volta region of Ghana to become community health workers and provide pre- and post-natal maternal and child-care, giving each villager the ability to be a sustainable resource that will transform his or her individual community.
GlobeMed member Jennifer Camello noted that the organization reached their goal for the day.
“We reached our goal in raising awareness about World Day of Social Justice as well as some social injustice issues surrounding foreign aid,” Camello said.

Thursday marked the final deadline to apply for the 2014 Teach For America corps. Last year, more than 100 students were accepted into the corps from USC.
Teach For America is a nonprofit that places recent college graduates as well as professionals in low-income classrooms for a two-year period in an effort to reduce educational inequity across the nation. The organization’s purpose is based on the connection it sees between economic inequity and educational inequity in America.
“[The fact] that 92 percent of kids who grow up below the poverty line return to poverty for a second generation is just completely unacceptable,” said Carrington Bester, recruitment manager for TFA Los Angeles and a 2011 Houston TFA corps member. “The more allies [these kids] have, the better off as a culture we are at eradicating the achievement gap in this country.”
Joining the TFA corps has become a popular option for many USC graduates. Last year, 109 Trojans were offered the opportunity to join the corps. Not only does this mean that USC received more TFA offers than any other campus in the nation, it also makes TFA the top post-graduate option for USC students.
Lexine Cudjoe, a senior majoring in political science, believes that USC’s engagement with its surrounding community encourages students to pursue such options as TFA.
“We’re very familiar with the inequalities and discrepancies on the perimeters of our school, and I think it’s very healthy for USC to continue to engage in the community around us,” Cudjoe said.
Cudjoe will be joining the 2014 Houston TFA corps, but she has already had a lot of experience with TFA. She attended USC’s                           TFA-sponsored Alternative Spring Break trip to Baton Rouge, La. last year and since then, has also interned for TFA in Mississippi and served as a campus campaign coordinator.
Cudjoe was inspired to get involved in TFA because of her own educational background. When she was in seventh grade at Foshay Learning Center, a nearby school located about a mile west from the University Park campus, she enrolled in the USC-sponsored Neighborhood Academic Initiative program that ultimately enabled her to attend a four-year university.
“In seeing the kind of impact that college has made on my social mobility, I want to, in turn, reach back into other students’ lives who would not have this opportunity to move out of poverty without education being the pathway,” Cudjoe said.
Zade Shakir, a senior majoring in biology and international relations, said he is excited to join the 2014 Bay Area corps because of his own experience with academic inequity in high school.
“Just because the high school near my house had a poor science program, I left high school hating science,” Shakir said. “Then I came to USC and took the science general [education] class here and I had a great professor. Now I can’t imagine my future without science.”
Shakir hopes by being part of TFA he can encourage other students to follow their dreams.
“I think of all the students that could be missing the opportunity to find their dreams,” Shakir said. “I want to be a part of the change for the future and to change this educational system that marginalizes some people.”
Shakir is not currently planning to pursue a lifelong career in education, but he believes that his time in TFA will both affect change for his students and will equip him with the skills necessary for his future career.
Milly Shah, a 2013 USC graduate and a member of the 2013 Charlotte corps, echoed Shakir’s beliefs. Shah currently hopes to go to physical therapy school after her two years in the corps, and noted that being a corps member is an opportunity for growth.
“It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but it’s immensely rewarding,” Shah said. “One thing I definitely did not think I was going to experience was immense corporate growth and growth in my leadership skills.”
Besides providing her with practical skills, being a member of the TFA corps has also been very personally rewarding for Shah.
“One moment that really stands out is when one of my students accidentally called me ‘Mom,’” Shah said. “As a teacher, you tend to forget that you are this consistent adult in an adolescent’s life … [Being called mom] reminded me that I’m so much more than just a teacher.”
TFA is doing more harm than good in sending ill-trained novices to teach in low-income minority schools.  USC students should reconsider TFA.  Instead volunteer as a teaching assistant, or after school program, or if you want to become a teacher get the best training you can (not 5 weeks).

My family loves film. It’s integral to who we are. My mom acts. My dad works in box office data. I’ve worked at a movie theater on and off throughout college. To no one’s surprise, we take the Academy Awards very seriously. And the Smith family father-daughter Oscar pool is no exception.
With that star-studded, glamorous day looming, my dad and I have started sh-t talking each other. He began, “Bring it. I took $11 from Nelkane (a family friend who lost a Super Bowl bet). You’re next!” I responded with, “Talk is cheap.” As reigning champion — two years and counting — I didn’t need to say much (take that, Dad).
Clearly, I love the Oscars. I love the dresses. I love trying to guess who will win. I love discussing the films at hand. I love the competition. I find it all thrilling and terribly exciting. But, lately, this tiny voice lingering in the back of my mind has been whispering, quite convincingly, that the Oscars are arbitrary — and none of it really matters.
Before I continue, I should point out that I will most definitely be watching the Oscars this year. The pool is alive and well. We even have a new addition to the group (you’re going down, Matt). I love a little friendly competition. Still, I keep questioning the point of it all, wondering why we hold this tiny gold man to such esteem.
To me, there really are only a handful of films every year that are truly moving, innovative and engaging. It’s an impressive feat to pull that off, I don’t deny that in the slightest. I do, however, think that most films are worthy in their own right.
I loved Fast & Furious 6 — it’s a guilty pleasure of mine and I will not apologize for it — and I got something out of it. It’s an incredibly fun, entertaining film. My dad and I have made a father-daughter tradition out of watching the Fast series together as well. I got something out of this film and enjoyed it for the mindless action-adventure that it is. But, context truly is everything.
I would not go so far as to compare Fast 6 to the other films I loved this year: 12 Years a Slave, Dallas Buyers Club, Fruitvale Station , Gravity, Her, Short Term 12 and The Wolf of Wall Street.
It might seem ridiculous to think of Fast & Furious 6 in relation to the aforementioned — but that’s exactly my point. Fast & Furious 6 is a thoughtless summer blockbuster while 12 Years a Slave is a poetic, expertly acted, amazingly thought-provoking cinematic masterpiece (and I don’t use that word lightly). I fully realize why the Academy would distinguish the Vin Diesels from the Chiwetel Ejiofors of the film world. In that sense, the awards make sense.
But, part of me feels that when you get to that level of excellence, what is the point of recognizing one film, director, actor, actress, etc. above another? Everything is subjective. Even when you look to the opinions of the most qualified people (directors, actors, producers, film critics) to decide what the “best” in film means, opinions will vary.
For different reasons, I found Spike Jonze’s Her to be just as beautiful and mesmerizing as 12 Years a Slave. They’re two films that I simply can’t stop thinking about even months later.  If 12 Years a Slave were to beat out Her, or vice versa, I would still find them equally compelling as would many others — I have no doubts about that. Again, if they’re on the same level of excellence — equally powerful, artistic and important — what is the point of saying one is better than the other?
Then there’s Academy misses and snubs to consider.
I still have my doubts about Sandra Bullock’s best actress win for The Blind Side. Loved the movie and I love my dear Sandra — Miss Congeniality, enough said — but in my mind, and many others I’m sure, the Academy got it wrong. Need I remind everyone that she was up against Meryl Streep for her portrayal as Julia Child in Julie & Julia?
And don’t even get me started on Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas best director miss in 1990. The man is one of the greatest auteurs of our time and he was robbed.
Even worse than misses are nomination snubs. Fruitvale Station and Short Term 12 stood apart as prime examples this year.
Michael B. Jordan played a sympathetic character grounded in reality who captured the shocking, heartbreaking nature of racism today. Snub. Brie Larson moved audiences in her devastating turn as a staff member at a troubled youth facility. Snub. Both films matched the stellar nature of their lead performers. Snub. Snub.
The Academy expanded Best Picture nominees to 10 films, so why are some of the best films of the year still going unnoticed?
I realize that I might sound a bit hypocritical in all of this. I’m criticizing a system that chooses the best, and yet I’m claiming Streep was better than Bullock, Scorsese better than Costner. By no means am I an expert — I’m just a film lover — but my point is that it is a flawed system because these awards are so subjective by nature.
All of this leads me to ultimately ask: What does Academy validation really mean? Why do we have to single out one film, performance or other cinematic achievement as the best?
The Academy’s stamp of approval acts as a marker of status. People are going to like what they’re going to like, accolades aside. With the months of talk and speculation leading up to the awards, and the hoopla surrounding the event, it all feels like a big, unnecessary spectacle that only a select portion of society really appreciates. And in that sense, with all the Academy misses and snubs and unnecessary grandeur, the awards feel arbitrary and unimportant.
I will watch the Academy Awards this year, but I will do so begrudgingly.

Anti-Christian bigotry at the Academy Awards?  You bet.  Where is Alone Yet Not Alone?  The Academy’s Board of Governors took this Christian song off the list of nominees because of the their bigotry against Christians.  The even larger problem is that it would win the Oscar.  See for yourself. Alone Yet Not Alone (Song) Performed by Joni Eareckson Tada ﻿
All of this leads me to ultimately answer…it generates buzz and controversy…what does controversy do for a film or a product…marketing 101 (you were not expected to know this…good article though)…these Awards also provides motivation for actors to accomplish many times beyond their expectations. Go enjoy the Awards by trying to beat your Dad (being a Dad, I just might be cheering for the old man).

A mother’s love, a mystery to all those who have never given birth, stays connected to her baby long after the physical link of the umbilical cord is snipped. Both parties wrestle with just how long this now invisible cord should be as time carries on; that hazy boundary between showing that the love is still as strong as ever yet it should also allow the space for each person to step into a new chapter of life. The mother in Calin Peter Netzer’s Child’s Pose completely ignores that line and instead grabs the severed umbilical cord off the floor and ties one end around her waist and the other into a strangling knot around her son’s neck. What she finds out over the course of the film, however, is that this method of dealing with life’s inevitable hardships is not as effective as she would like to believe.
Parent trap · Child’s Pose focuses on the drama, meddling and underlying sense of failure in a overbearing mother-son relationship. The film wass Romania’s submission for this year’s Oscars. – Photo courtesy of Zeitgeist Films
Cornelia, played masterfully by Romanian actress Luminita Gheorghia, is as overbearing and controlling as they come — a matriarch to end all matriarchs. With her dyed blonde hair, perfected makeup, black stiletto boots and a rotating collection of extravagant fur coats, she demands the camera and everyone else in her world to notice and obey her. Yet her domineering hand is motivated — albeit very deep below the surface — by love. She wants the best for everyone in her life, right down to the maid, and believes that the only way this is achievable is with her at the helm. She preaches to everyone to quit smoking out of one side of her mouth while lighting up her fifth cigarette of the day out the other. When she breaks into her deadbeat middle-aged son Barbu’s (Bogdan Dumitrache) apartment, she inspects his bookshelf for the Nobel Prize winners she brought him to expand his mind, feeds his fish and pees in his toilet like she owns the place (she probably does). But, when Barbu runs over a 14–year-old boy who foolishly tried to cross the freeway, Cornelia’s ability to direct her son’s life is put to the test.
Cornelia contacts doctors to fudge potentially damaging Breathalyzer tests and bribes the witness into altering his statement while Barbu sulks like a spineless fish in the background. Yet, beneath all the chaos and meddling lurks a sense of failure, the classic theme of a parent trying to relive their offspring mistake-free and the inevitable disappointment when the child falls harder than they did.
In anyone else’s hands, the film could have easily taken a hard right down the road of exaggerated melodrama, but Netzer is able to steer the tale away from that danger and find its heart, allowing it to lead him where it may.
Andrei Butica’s handheld camera is constantly pushing in to keep up with the emotional turbulence, and though the style lends an organic feel to the slice-of-life tale, one wishes that it would settle down for a moment during particularly heavy scenes to allow the audience to gather its bearings and wholly focus on the marvelous acting. But the active, documentary-like cinematography creates such  realism that the possibility of this sticky situation happening to us lingers uncomfortably close.
And Razvan Rasulescu’s screenplay is so well-written, it could be an intimate play. The story flows along seamlessly and all the characters are uniquely developed with multiple layers and strange idiosyncrasies that give the sense that the audience is only scraping the surface. Weaving together subtle humor, social commentary on the gap between rich and poor, the ancient mother–child struggle and an inquiry into the monetary price of justice and human life, Child’s Pose softly prods the audience to examine its own moral and familial fibers long after the screen has gone black.
The film, which screened at USC on Wednesday, won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival and was Romania’s submission for the Academy Awards, though it was unjustly not nominated.
None of Romania’s entries have ever been accepted for Academy Award consideration, but with work such as Child’s Pose, it’s about time Hollywood paid attention.
Child’s Pose is playing at the Nuart theater through Feb. 27.

Following NBA All-Star Weekend, there has been a lot of discussion regarding the NBA’s “Mount Rushmore,” as superstars and future Hall of Famers LeBron James and Kobe Bryant both revealed their own preference for which NBA legends would adorn the fictitious mountain honoring the league’s history.
LeBron and Kobe agreed on three that seemed to be fairly obvious choices — Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. They would disagree on the fourth member, though, as LeBron elected to go with Oscar Robertson, aka “The Big O,” while Kobe chose former Celtics great Bill Russell.
Both Kobe and LeBron had reasons to choose their respective players, as Robertson is the only player in NBA history to average a triple-double for an entire season (1961-1962) while Russell has more NBA championships (11) than anyone else.
Since there can only be four greats on the landmark, however, the important takeaway here is that there will always someone inevitably left out, regardless of how prominent or dominant that person was as a player.
In other words, someone’s feelings are going to be hurt no matter who is chosen.
Just like he did as a player, Russell got defensive and fired back at LeBron for leaving him out.
“Hey, thank you for leaving me off your Mount Rushmore,” the 80-year-old Russell told TNT’s Craig Sager. “I’m glad you did. Basketball is a team game. It’s not for individual honors. I won back-to-back state championships in high school, back-to-back NCAA championships in college. I won an NBA championship my first year in the league, an NBA championship in my last year, and nine in between. That, Mr. James, is etched in stone.”
Russell’s true wisdom spoke out against the ignorance of a young superstar, who one day also thinks that it will be his face up on the mountain.
All of this NBA “Mount Rushmore” talk, nonetheless, can also be translated to USC football, where people have debated for years over who would make the cut.
There are simply too many different factors to consider, and creating the perfect “USC Football Mount Rushmore” could indeed be considered an impossible task.
It’s tough, but I’m going to give this a shot — and just to clarify, I’m using players only.
Looking at just the past 50 years of  ’SC football, I would have to start off with running back Marcus Allen, who former USC head coach John Robinson called one of the greatest players he had ever seen. Allen reminds me a lot of the nation’s first president, George Washington — Mount Rushmore’s most prominent character.
Next, I would have to go with a player who is widely regarded as one of the best defensive backs in NFL history: Ronnie Lott. He’s definitely a lot like our 16th president, Abraham Lincoln, who also held down the fort for the betterment of the Union.
The third slot on the monument belongs to the one player who always seems to be forgotten, similarly to 26th president, Theodore Roosevelt: quarterback Matt Leinart, who won two national championships and a Heisman trophy with the Trojans.
And last but not least, with a big asterisk because he technically never won anything at USC (or even took the field), the one and only Reggie Bush, who was probably one of the most dynamic and exciting players with the ball in his hands at any level — a lot like our third president, Thomas Jefferson, who inspired democracy around the world.
Allen, Lott, Leinart and Bush — there’s my “Mount Rushmore” of USC football.
But wait — why am I comparing former football players to past U.S. presidents? I sound pretty silly, don’t I?
For some reason fans and sportswriters, myself included, continue to put athletes and former heads of state on the same pedestal in order to analogize them. And more than ever, this “Mount Rushmore” conversation is getting out of hand.
This needs to stop, and quickly, because I don’t know how much longer athletes and fans alike can continue to put up with seeing their favorite players left off a mountain initially meant for presidents.
Not only are these unnecessary and outrageous foils being made, but time also goes into the discussion as well. All of our perceptions of players inarguably change with time.
There is really no true way to juxtapose players when most of them were at their primes in different eras, especially because the game has evolved so much over time with rule changes.
Do you think that Wilt Chamberlain would score 100 points in today’s modern game? Probably not. But he was one of the league’s most dominant players in the 1970s.
Mount Rushmore was built to enshrine some of our nation’s greatest leaders, not our most beloved and successful athletes.
In sports, we also have a place for enshrinement called the Hall of Fame, and we have a system in place to make sure that those who rightfully deserve to be elected are.
Yes, the Hall of Fame has its disputes as well when it comes to voting but at least it doesn’t involve attempting to select four players to represent the entire history of a league or sport.
I’m not going to lie, it is fun to do sometimes, but all of this “Mount Rushmore” talk in sports lately has just been too much.
I think it is more amusing and appropriate to compare athletes to movie stars, anyway.

The past two weekends have treated the defending national champion USC women’s water polo team well, as they opened the season with an eight-game winning streak after claiming the Triton Invitational and Lancer Invitational titles.
Rising above · Junior driver Jennifer Stiefel and the Women of Troy are undefeated through eight games this season. Stiefel has recorded 11 goals. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
During the stretch, the Women of Troy have bolted out of the gates offensively in addition to exhibiting stonewall defense, outscoring their opponents 145-20.
Though the ample offensive production has been a product of a variety of scorers, junior driver Monica Vavic is quickly filling the stat sheet. Through just eight games, USC’s No. 11 all-time career scoring leader has posted 26 goals — bringing her career total to 155.
“Monica has been incredible on offense and defense,” said senior attacker Olivia Cummins, who registered four goals of her own over four games at the Lancer Invitational. “She’s attacking and getting back, giving up few mistakes and just continuing to strike on offense.”
But for USC, the real test has yet to come. After playing against some weaker opponents so far, National Coach of the Year Jovan Vavic and his team have one of their toughest weekends of the season ahead — the Women of Troy will travel to Irvine, Calif. to compete in the UCI Invitational.
USC — the reigning UCI Invitational champion — finds itself in a pool of highly talented squads, including No. 2 Stanford and No. 3 UCLA. Both of these teams proved to be hefty speed bumps in last year’s road to the championship as Vavic’s team squeaked past UCLA with an 11-10 victory in the semifinals before taking down Stanford 13-10 in the finals.
“We have to go into every game with the same mindset. You practice for each game, and maybe they might not be as tough, but they’re practice for the tough games,” Cummins said. Cummins, who played her freshman season for UCI before transferring to USC — about the differing skill levels of the early-season opponents. “If you’re not focusing, not communicating, not executing the plays correctly, then how are you going to do it in tough situations?”
The Women of Troy will begin their title defense early Saturday morning with an 8 a.m. start against Cal State Bakersfield. The Roadrunners will enter the contest with a 5-9 record, having dropped all eight of their matchups against top-20 teams this season.
Depending on the results of the early session, the Trojans will either face No. 8 Loyola Marymount (5-3) or have a rematch of the Triton Invitational game against No. 10 Cal State Northridge (7-3) in the second game of the doubleheader.
Unlike CSU Bakersfield, the Lions of LMU have had some success against tougher opponents, tallying three wins against ranked teams so far this season.
In the first meeting between the Women of Troy and Cal State Northridge this season, the ball-hawking USC defense proved too fierce for the Matadors, as the Women of Troy recorded their sixth shutout in program history with a 13-0 victory. Senior goalie Flora Bolonyai had a standout 10-save performance in the contest, contributing to her résumé and claiming that week’s MSPF Player of the Week award.
Junior driver Sara Salamon emphasized the team’s focus heading into the weekend — the lone criticism Coach Vavic shared after last tournament: utilizing and improving the fast break.
“We need to secure the fast break and make sure we are constantly aware,” Salamon said. “Our goal is to play well, look for the open player, play good defense and keep pushing our offense.”

The Women of Troy are in the homestretch, hosting Bay Area rivals No. 4 Stanford and No. 19 Cal in their last two home games of the regular season. As the season winds down, the Women of Troy (16-10, 9-5 Pac-12) have one last chance at breaking their 13-game losing streak against the Cardinal (25-2, 13-0).
Setting the standard · USC junior guard Ariya Crook combined for 52 points in two games against Stanford and Cal last month, leading her team in scoring both times. Crook is averaging 15.7 points per game this season. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
 
“Our focus is reducing the amount of turnovers we commit and defending the three-point line,” said head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke.
Despite a great start to the season and a dramatic overall improvement from last season, the Women of Troy have lost their stride at times in the second half of the season — the catalyst being the road loss at Stanford late last month that led to a three-game skid for the Women of Troy following the visit to The Farm.
Cooper-Dyke began preaching the importance of being a “defense-first” team at the beginning of the season. The coach attributes much of the team’s early success to that mindset as the Women of Troy came out of the gate swinging. Not only were the Women of Troy 3-0 to start the conference season, but they played with purpose, avenging losses from the previous season against all three of those opponents (UCLA, Utah and Colorado).
“We have to get back to the basics,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We have to play physical basketball, execute offensively, rebound the ball and not allow teams to get second and third looks at the basket.”
The matchup against Stanford will certainly be a challenging test. The Women of Troy will have to elevate their performance at both ends of the court to upset the reigning Pac-12 champions.
“I tell the team, ‘We have got to make better decisions,’” Cooper-Dyke said.
Though defense is paramount, the Women of Troy can’t forget to show up on offense, as both Stanford and Cal are strong defensively.
“Our offensive strategy is going to be cutting to the basket, knocking down outside shots and taking wide open shots without hesitation,” Cooper-Dyke said.
Stanford senior forward Chiney Ogwumike, the frontrunner for Pac-12 Player of the Year, is the team’s only player with a double-digit scoring average (27.1 points per game). Ogwumike gave the Women of Troy’s defense fits in the two teams’ last meeting, as the unanimous preseason All-American racked up 30 points and 12 rebounds.
“There is no way to completely stop her on either end of the floor,” Cooper-Dyke said. “She is simply a fantastic talent; all we can do is double-team as much as we can.”
The Cardinal shot nearly 51 percent when the Women of Troy made the trip to The Farm. Though USC kept it close in the beginning, Stanford’s seven three-pointers were instrumental in the 88-59 blowout.
This time around, the Women of Troy have the opportunity to close out their home slate with a major upset and gain the necessary momentum as they move into the postseason.
A win against these ranked opponents requires each member of the team to step up.
“It can’t just be the [senior forward] Cassie Harberts show,” Cooper-Dyke said. “Other players have to be accountable and step up to the challenge.”
The Women of Troy will also take on Cal (18-7, 10-4) this weekend after pulling out a 77-70 win earlier this season. In that game, USC junior guard Ariya Cook took her coach’s motivational words to heart, racking up 34 points by the game’s end — the most by a single player on USC’s women’s basketball team since 2002.
This weekend, the Women of Troy are hoping for an encore performance. With the knowledge that Harberts will probably be double-teamed, the Women of Troy will have to call on contributions from the entire team.

Since the launch of the Affordable Care Act last October, 625,000 Californians have been enrolled in health care plans, with more than 1.2 million Californians enrolling in the state’s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, according to Time. Despite the state’s progress in implementing the new health care options, a significant part of California’s population is still without health care: its undocumented immigrants.
Design by Julien Nicolai
 
California State Senator Ricardo Lara aims to address the issue through his introduction of his Health For All Act, which would grant every Californian access to health care regardless of immigration status, according to the Sacramento Bee. Though the bill is well-intentioned in its aim to address the lack of health care among the undocumented population, it only provides a short-term solution and fails to acknowledge the potential economic burden to the state.
In the past few years, California has made great strides in its efforts to expand the rights and accessibility of services of the state’s undocumented immigrant population. Last October, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation granting undocumented immigrants the right to receive driver’s licenses. Three months later, the California Supreme Court ruled that undocumented immigrant Sergio Garcia could receive a California law license. Furthering the rights of undocumented immigrants through the expansion of health care seems like a logical next step.
But it’s not that simple.
Arguments in favor of the bill’s passage point to the potential economic incentives, particularly in regard to saving money spent on emergency room services for preventable treatments. Lara said that by providing undocumented immigrants with health care, the state could ultimately save the $1.4 billion it spends annually on emergency care to those without insurance, according to the Los Angeles Times. What Lara fails to acknowledge, however, are the economic repercussions that providing health care for California’s approximately 3 million uninsured residents would have on the state.
The final wording of the Affordable Care Act does not allocate federal funds to finance coverage for undocumented immigrants. As such, there would be no federal reimbursement from the federal government, leaving the burden of picking up the cost to Californians themselves. With no current projection on how much the bill would ultimately cost, it is unlikely that such an unclear bill would pass — especially with the absence of federal funding. With the threat of recession and other fiscal challenges (notably the significant funding being dedicated to California’s significant drought issues), committing to a deal with an unforeseen economic burden on the state is simply not realistic.
Granting undocumented immigrants access to driver’s licenses and health care are all major strides in the effort to expand the rights and liberties of undocumented immigrants. They are rights that should be extended to all state citizens. Attempting to grant these rights as an exception to the current laws without addressing the economic setbacks associated with them is counterproductive. As well-intentioned as bills such as Lara’s might be, they fail to address the feasibility of such an important change.

RE: “They are rights that should be extended to all state citizens.”
Knock, knock.  Hello??  “Undocumented immigrants” are, by definition, NOT citizens.  If there were citizens, they wouldn’t be “undocumented.”  Some would say “illegal aliens,” but for political correctness purposes, we are no longer able to use this clear language and must obfuscate with “undocumented immigrant.”  Eventually, giving the “undocumented immigrant” (aka “illegal alien” subject to immediate and justifiable deportation, as in most rational countries, including Mexico especially (for which the concept of “undocumented immigrant” doesn’t exist, especially when it comes to Hondurans and Guatemalans sneaking across the borders there)) the common privileges normally associated with citizenship will make us all more comfortable thinking that they are (as you say) “state citizens,” when most emphatically they are NOT.

Lately, there’s been a wave of change sweeping through California, granting increased privileges and rights to undocumented immigrants. In September 2013, the state assembly voted 55-19 to allow the state’s undocumented immigrants the right to receive drivers’ licenses. In October 2013, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law allowing them to obtain law licenses. A bill proposed earlier this month seeks to extend health insurance to this population, according to the Sacramento Bee.
Design by Julien Nicolai
Though this bill might seem unfair to legal citizens whose tax dollars will most likely go to paying for this coverage, it has practical reasons that will benefit the state in the present.
Proposed by Sen. Ricardo Lara, this bill’s justification lies first and foremost in the unique demographics of California. The National Review reports that of 38 million residents, 2.5 million are undocumented immigrants. Of these 2.5 million people, 1 million are uninsured. These statistics mean that for this undocumented population, there are many uncompensated visits to the emergency room and low-cost clinics.
With President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, the federal payments to healthcare providers that carry out a lot of uncompensated care to the uninsured will be reduced. In theory this works because under the ACA, fewer providers will need compensation as more Americans are insured. Yet for California, a state that has a large and ever-growing undocumented population, hospitals and clinics will not be getting adequate compensation or the federal financial support they need to operate on the expected quality level that patients deserve.
Under legislation called the Health for All Act, this bill will allow undocumented immigrants to qualify for Medicaid coverage paid fully by the state, thus presenting a much-needed solution to inadequate compensation and consequent inefficiency of the state’s health care system. If passed, the bill would offer two options for undocumented Californians seeking health care coverage. For those whose incomes are under 138 percent of the poverty level — about $32,000 a year for a family of four — Medi-Cal will be extended. For those who make more, there will be an insurance exchange. Lara said that the bill would relieve overcrowding in emergency rooms and reduce the state cost of health care due to increasing early diagnosis of problems before they become more expensive to treat, according to the National Review.
Until legislators get to planning and implementing a long-term solution to immigration issues, temporary solutions such as this bill are needed. The need to keep the system running is also fueled by the implementation of the ACA. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website, the purpose of the act is to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable health insurance. An inefficient system that is still bogged down by uncompensated visits from the undocumented immigrant population does not satisfy that mission. Though this population is indeed undocumented, it still has a presence in the state. By providing an opportunity for these people to become insured, the system might be able to concentrate on the goal laid out early on by ACA.
Documented or not, these California residents are here in this state as members of society who are in need of medical treatment. As representatives of the state, it’s the responsibility of our state legislators to address this need.

No where does our state constitution say anything about providing medical services outside of prisons. Every criminal that comes from another country need only be caught and placed in prison to get near unlimited medical services. Our prisons even help people become transgendered. 
The only things that the state MUST do are listed in the state constitution. 
We rely on the state to enforce the laws against theft, violence and fraud, Once the state gets out of those few things, it becomes VERY expensive to administer. 
Where does a state’s money come from? In the end, all the payments for medical services come from the people. Funneling the money through the state first is just a way to make medical services more expensive. Every government employee expects to be paid. They all expect pensions and the highest quality benefits. The fewer services that go through the state the more everyone will have to pay their own way.

The USC chapter of Black Campus Ministries hosted a panel Wednesday evening, “Ask a Black Person,” which aimed at promoting greater awareness of the black community.
The event was held in celebration of Black History Month and topics ranged from racial identity to the underrepresentation of black students at USC.
Members of the BCM gathered the anonymous questions from students near Tommy Trojan on Monday and Tuesday.
Members of the panel included seven students who identified themselves differently across a variety of racial groups. Adaobi Ugoagu, a junior majoring in anthropology who helped organize the event, hoped that it would further understanding on campus.
“We want to promote racial reconciliation on the campus and cross-cultural understanding across the black people on this campus with other races,” she said.
Moderator Jillian Baker, a sophomore majoring in communication and African American studies, cautioned that the discussion did not define the views of a majority of black students.
“Just a disclaimer, as seven black people, we do not represent the opinions of every black person,” she said. “These are just our opinions on how we view the black community.”
Many questions focused on differences between varying races. In response to a question about what values black people have, panelist Jerome Campbell focused on the unifying characteristics of the two communities.
“I think it’s really easy to look at black culture and say it’s something completely different,” Campbell said. “You watch TV [and] you see hip hop, you see prison, you see gangs, and it’s almost like black culture is it’s own thing that’s separate from the rest of America. And that’s just not true. We want all the same things as any other American: to be treated the same, to not feel judged when you walk into a room, to walk into a room and not feel like you’re the only person representing your race.”
Other questions touched on the role of black students USC and their respective representation. One question asked whether students felt that the campus was an accepting area for black students.
Panelist Rachael Caulker stated that her experiences in the classroom sometimes reflected a lack of understanding on campus.
“You just realize that it’s not because people don’t want to work with you necessarily, it’s because of the fact that they unfortunately do not feel comfortable around you,” she said. “I think it’s a comfort sort of thing and people generally go to their own ethnicities.”
Panelist Akeallah Blair also spoke of her experiences living with her three white roommates. She stated that she would sometimes hear racially insensitive comments.
“What I realize is that it’s not coming from a bad place, it’s just how they were raised and how they think things are,” Blair said. “ I realize that I didn’t come here to fight this racism battle, I came here to get my education.”
Students felt that the event was informative and highlighted issues that are not often discussed on campus.
“Seeing people who are just like me going through these different issues of perception or issues of cultural clash and racial profiling, things that are very serious but that are overlooked in light of things that are more immediate, like midterms and whatnot, that was a really cool way to get my brain working in a different sense,” said Wendy Wu, a sophomore majoring in business and accounting.
Aaron Ashby, a freshman majoring in film and TV production, agreed that the event was helpful in contributing to conversations about racism.
“I think the goal was to get people to ask questions that they wouldn’t feel comfortable asking,” Ashby said. “I think it was really good to open up dialogue to people who don’t feel comfortable with that conversation.”
