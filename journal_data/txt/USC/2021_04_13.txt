When Randy Tun found out he got into USC, his dad was sleeping — but not for long.
Tun, who will major in business administration, said he opened the long-awaited application status update, spent 30 seconds staring at his phone screen in shock, teared up a little bit, celebrated with his mom, then rushed into the room where his dad was fast asleep.
“Yo, Dad, I got in! I got in!” Tun said. 
Tun’s dad jumped out of bed: “LET’S GOOOOOOO,” he said. And the celebration began.
Tun is the first person in his family to attend college. Without the guidance of someone who had applied to college before, he relied on outside reading and YouTube to learn about the process. It was tedious and rough, Tun said, but he managed to get through it.
In USC’s class of 2025, Tun is far from alone. One in five students admitted are first generation college students, the highest in USC history — 3% more than last year’s class and 5% more than the year before. 
Additionally, 8% of students admitted into the class of 2025 are Black and 18% are Latinx, also an increase from the past two years. 
While more diverse than in years past, the percentage of Black and Latinx students admitted at USC is not exceptional compared to other universities. NYU’s class of 2024 was 9% Black and 18% Latinx, and Harvard’s class of 2025 is 18% Black, though only 13.3% Latinx.
Vincent Demonte, who will major in journalism, was accepted into USC back in February when he learned he would be considered for a full scholarship. Both of Demonte’s parents attended USC, so for him, it was a dream come true.
“Basically from the moment I was born, I’ve been living the USC life, going to football games all the time. I’ve been on campus a ton of times before … Opening that letter to see that I’d gotten into USC and also was up potentially for a full ride scholarship to USC, it just blew me away,” Demonte said. 
Demonte, who is Latino, said he is encouraged by the diversity of the class of 2025, which is, by many measures, the most diverse in USC history. 
“That’s the best way, honestly, to get a glimpse at the world that only college can really provide,” Demonte said. “Understanding different points of view and seeing how other people from across the United States and from different backgrounds, how they live and their own set beliefs on the world. I think it’s just an awesome way to get to know people.”
Morgan Dodero, who will major in psychology, said that once she knew she was accepted, she screamed, hugged her family, then called everyone she could think of. 
It felt especially good, she said, because of how the pandemic disrupted her junior and senior years of high school. 
“My senior year was definitely not what I expected at all,” Dodero said. “Almost all of my activities got interfered with somehow or just cut off altogether. So being able to end the year, and [say], ‘OK, yes this year wasn’t the best, but I got into USC, and I get to look forward to the next four years.’”
For Tun, Demonte and most of the class of 2025, the last few years of high school — without proms, sports seasons and even seeing friends everyday without masks — was far different, and in many ways more challenging, than what most students experience. 
Tun, Demonte and Dodero were all relieved by USC’s decision to drop its SAT/ACT requirement, and none of the three submitted an SAT or ACT score. Only Demonte took the test, and all three said that not needing to submit their score helped them get in by highlighting parts of their personalities that go beyond a test score. 
Without the score, Tun said that he could express himself more through his essays. 
“I kind of showed off my interests in things like sports or stock trading and stuff like that, kind of just show off who I am as an individual, rather than ‘oh, a test score that shows that I’m smart,’” he said. 
Demonte, on the other hand, took the ACT once. Afterwards, he was scheduled to take the SAT two or three times, but each time, it was canceled because of the coronavirus. Ultimately, he said that losing the requirement helped him for similar reasons as Tun: he could highlight who he was and what he’s passionate about — like comedy — rather than just a test score. 
USC is planning a full return to campus in the fall, with in-person classes and students in dorms. After an up and down, unusual application process, Tun said he is just happy — and maybe a little surprised — that he will be coming to USC in the fall.
“I had kind of been doubtful of my acceptance,” he said. “I actually got rejected from some of the UCs, and it kind of put me in a doubtful position for my dream college. And when I got the result, I was just like ‘Wow man, that’s crazy.’”

Last March, Dr. Neeraj Sood wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal, explaining that in order to find accurate numbers of people who were infected by and died due to the coronavirus, “testing only sick or symptomatic patients will not get us to the truth.”
This led Sood, vice dean of faculty affairs and researcher at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, to reach out to Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, to collaborate on a study that was able to provide further information regarding how widespread the coronavirus was within the county. Following this study, USC and L.A. County collaborated on another study in an effort to construct a representative cohort study within the county.  
Spearheaded by co-principal investigators Sood and Dr. Howard Hu, department chair and professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, the collaboration is also working with a private marketing firm, Lieberman Research Worldwide, focused on recruiting a diverse set of participants, representative of the county, for coronavirus antibody testing, along with spit testing to test for current viral infection. The firm finds participants by reaching out online, over the phone and by handing out physical flyers to “hard to reach populations.” 
“It’s really a three-part partnership that is going to execute this study: private, public and university,” Hu said. “It’s a unique blend.” 
Hu stated that the research team is now aiming for a cohort of 2,000 adults, and as many as 1,000 children as children were not included in the initial study Dr. Sood discussed. Currently, the research team has funding for the study to span over a four to six month period, in which two to three observations will take place. The study is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as resources from L.A. County and the University.   
“The goal is to secure funding to keep this going, as long as the pandemic is still going,” Hu said. “Luckily, the federal administration has committed all sorts of funding to really control this epidemic, and certainly, understanding some of the behavior of this epidemic is part of that plan, so this study will probably be going on for many months.” 
According to Simon, this data will provide information on the coronavirus and its progress. 
 “This study just helps paint a clearer picture of where the epidemic is and where it seems to be going, how well we’re doing with vaccinations and how much protection we’re getting with vaccinations,” Simon said. “I think it’s raised awareness in the minds of the public and of policymakers of the importance of surveillance and having good data.” 
The researchers hoped to find more information on the natural infection to the virus, herd immunity and vaccinations’ effects on people’s behavior.  The team also hoped to determine whether or not there is a distinction between those who developed natural immunity via coronavirus infection, versus immunity acquired through vaccination.
Along with more comprehensive knowledge about the spread of the virus and how it affects one’s immune system and mental health, the cohort study will also be able to answer other questions about patients’ experiences with vaccinations.   
“We want to try to answer all of those questions — what are the inequities in allocation of vaccines and, in general, the burden of disease?” Sood said. “The goal of the study is to not only answer some of the pressing questions we have right now, but to kind of set up the infrastructure to answer questions that might arise in the future.”  
The collaboration between the county and USC is a “great partnership,” Simon said, and the experience that Hu and Sood bring to the project makes the study even “stronger and more impactful.” 
“There is expertise at USC that is wonderful to be able to tap into,” Simon said. “There are really smart folks who have very specific research expertise that can be helpful.”
Furthermore, Sood said that this collaboration could provide a sense of validity to their research, allowing the general population to know that the team’s work was aligned with the department and more generally aligned with improving public health in L.A. County. 
“L.A. County is a wonderful partner for this study because the County’s Department of Public Health is staffed by some amazing professionals, and they have given us access to all sorts of resources to conduct this study,” Hu said. 
Hu hopes that this project will provide comprehensive knowledge regarding the current status of the coronavirus within Los Angeles. 
“I think that our goal is to help ourselves and particularly our colleagues at the L.A. County Department of Public Health to know where the biggest gaps are,” Hu said.
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Lieberman Research Worldwide as Lieberman Research West. It also didn’t include Dr. Howard Hu’s full title. He is both a professor of preventive medicine and the department chair at the Keck School of Medicine. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Native Americans, Alaska Natives and Indigenous creators have turned to TikTok to share their history and culture.
#NativeTikTok has amassed 1.8 billion views, with Indigenous people from all over North America contributing to the hashtag. From traditional dances to comedic videos, these creators are addressing social and political issues facing their communities and showing the plethora of different rituals that exist within every Indigenous group. 
What makes these videos even more meaningful is that TikTok has provided a platform for these creators to freely show their pride and given a voice to their people who have been erased for generations. Not only that, many of the rituals that users are being taught were once made illegal. If you want to learn more about Indigenous traditions, here is a list of six Indigenous creators you should follow as they shatter stereotypes about their culture.
@notoriouscree — James Jones
James Jones is a Cree traditional hoop dancer. He posts videos on TikTok doing this beautiful healing dance wearing full traditional regalia, sharing his powwow preparation routine and his experience as a member of the Cree Nation in Canada. Jones teaches his followers the significance behind every aspect of hoop dancing: the steps, the colorful regalia, the hoops and his braids. While creating trends of his own on the app, Jones has also put his own twist on mainstream trends. For instance, he’s done hoop dancing versions of “Blinding Lights” and “Tootsie Slide.” Jones’ account gives a wide range of insight into his experience not just as a dancer, but as an Indigenous person. 
@shinanova — Shina Nova
Shina Nova gained popularity on TikTok while sharing her journey of learning Inuit throat singing from her mother, Kayuula (you can follow her @kayuulanova). While singing, Nova and her mother are in complete harmony and synchronization, creating a mesmerizing performance that is sure to command the attention of anyone listening. Their mother-daughter bond is so tangible it jumps off the screen. Nova not only posts her journey of learning throat singing, but she brings awareness to mockery that has occurred surrounding the tradition. Promoting a message of healing and respect, Nova, along with her mother, are beautiful people guaranteed to put a smile on your face when they come up in your feed. 
@desertndn — Haatepah Coyotl
Haatepah Coyotl is a Kumai/Chichimeca Guamare model who has turned to TikTok to educate mostly non-Native users on all things about Indigenous people. What stands out about Coyotl’s account is that it isn’t solely about his Native background. Rather, he brings awareness to Black and Afro-Native and Latin Indigenous communities who are often left out of discourse surrounding Indigenous communities. Discussing topics such as water insecurity, environmental issues and colorism that exists within Indigenous communities, Coyotl creates videos that are an amazing starting point for further research into how non-Natives can support Indigenous peoples. 
@indigenous_baddie — Michelle Chubb
A member of the Swampy Cree Tribe, Michelle Chubb is a jingle dress dancer who makes videos about every facet of the tradition. Chubb’s is a multi-talented creator as she not only dances in jingle dresses, she makes them too. Residing in Winnipeg, Canada, Chubb shares what it is like living in the largest Indigenous-populated city in Canada. Her dancing, sewing and educational videos are extremely insightful into the Indigenous experience. Once you hear the rhythmic and melodic sounds her jingle dresses make while dancing, you won’t be able to get enough of her videos.  
@geronimo.warrior — Geronimo Louie
Geronimo Louie is a Chiricahua Apache and Navajo fashion designer using TikTok to show off his talent in crafting traditional Indigenous ribbon work clothing. Louie uses this a way to express his Two-Spirit identity — an Indigenous person who has both male and female spirits or identifies with both genders — as well as his Indigenous queer identity. Louie’s account provides a safe space for people who are Two-Spirit or queer and provides discourse on what it means to be a part of those communities. His beautifully designed skirts and dresses earned him a feature in Vogue and are sure to earn him a follow by any user on TikTok. 
@tiamiscihx — Tia Wood
Tia Wood, a Plains Cree and Salish creator, shares videos donning traditional regalia while singing. She is taking widely trending TikTok sounds and “making them Indigenous” by adding Native vocalizations to the track. A talented singer and dancer, Wood posts different teachings and history lessons from “Aunty T,” a term of endearment that she calls herself. Whether she is singing traditional Indigenous songs or dancing in bright-colored regalia, Wood’s account exhibits the beauty of Indigenous rituals and is one that deserves a spot on your following list. 
Trinity Gomez is a junior writing about TikTok and popular culture. Her column, “TikTalk,” runs every other Tuesday.

USC’s response to the increased Asian American violent attacks has been nothing short of disappointing, with the bewilderingly mild response set out by the administration a sobering check of reality for Asian Trojans looking to find solace in their university.
Ever since the wake of the coronavirus pandemic back in March 2020, hate crime reports against Asian American and Pacific Islander communities have skyrocketed, with over 3,800 attacks in the past year. More recently, increasing amounts of disturbing incidents have been appearing throughout the United States, from the 65-year-old Asian American woman who was brutally attacked as she walked to church in New York City’s Times Square to the Pakistani driver who was killed when two teenagers carjacked his Uber and caused him to crash. It’s a dark time for Asian Americans, who have dealt with a year of increased social criticism underneath the oppressive reach of the coronavirus.
The administration’s response, however, has been nothing short of half-hearted. On March 19, President Carol Folt sent a schoolwide message to Trojans, expressing regret and sadness for the victims of the Atlanta shooting and noted that the attacks — “which appear to be rooted in a mix of racial, gender and sexual bias — come amid a disturbing rise of anti-Asian violence in our country.” In addition to this, Folt posted an Instagram graphic to her own instagram page, in which she noted that she was “deeply disturbed that the attack comes amid growing violence against Asian Americans.” It’s a nice sentiment but one that ultimately falls flat as an almost useless, if well-intentioned, response. 
When USC’s main Instagram page won’t even acknowledge the increasing racially based attacks on Asian American students, there is an inherent problem at hand. Certain schools have taken it upon themselves to go about further informational spreading. Willow Bay, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, for example, sent out a schoolwide email on March 25 addressing the anti-Asian violence, shouting out specific organizations such as the Annenberg Cross-Cultural Student Association and the USC chapter of the Asian American Journalists Association, along with advertising Asian-led events that would spread information about the issues at hand. 
The University’s main administrative response, however, is offensively light. This type of inaction isn’t necessarily something new to the anti-Asian attacks either; nine months ago, I wrote an article detailing how the administration wasn’t doing nearly enough for the Black Lives Matter movement that was sweeping the country on a national scale, and that members of the administration should be financially supporting the movement. It is a shame to see that in the eight to nine months since that article, the administration has not changed their tactics when approaching these sensitive cultural milestones. 
Let me be abundantly clear; it is not nearly enough to simply link mental health and Asian student services and to repeat empty platitudes that USC stands with Asian students. At the very least, an official, Universitywide email sent out by the president or some other authority figure on how the “model minority” myth has been an extenuating critical reason as to anti-Asian behavior in the country, or how violence against Asians have been contextualized into national matters for years would have sufficed. 
A more detailed response, one rife with links to student organizations that could provide a community in these trying times and educational pieces of reading for those unaware of the current plight Asian Americans face to catch up on, would have been extremely appreciated not just by the Asian American community at USC, but by those outside of it who wish to learn more. 
Instead, Asian Americans are greeted with meaningless assurances that the school stands with Asian students without any real, active measures taken to prove otherwise. There is no better time for Folt and the administration to prove that they have listened to students and their demands, and if it is not, then it stands as a failure by the administration.
