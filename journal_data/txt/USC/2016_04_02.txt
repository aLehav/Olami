Charlie Walk, president of Republic Records and Joe Jonas, lead singer of pop band DNCE, spoke at the Carson Television Center at the Thornton School of Music Friday as part of Thornton’s Popular Music Program Founding Director Christopher Sampson’s “Popular Music Forum” to offer advice to music industry students and promote DNCE’s latest project.
Walk played a music video clip of DNCE’s most successful single, “Cake by the Ocean” and discussed how to distinguish between a Top 40 hit and a regular hit.
“I don’t mean to say this in a cocky way or arrogantly, but we’re not doing classical music we’re doing pop music. ‘Pop’ is a derivative of the word ‘popular,’” Walk said. “I’ve been involved with over 400 number one songs. I know how they started, I know how they broke and every case has been different and there have been casualties along the way, but we’re pretty good at predicting the future.”
Jonas offered perspective on the creative process behind his personal successes and failures.
“There’s been times in my career and I’m like ‘This is the song, this is the one’ and I play it for somebody and they have a different opinion and tell me to go back to the studio,” Jonas said.
Despite the possibility of creative conflict, Jonas highlighted the necessity of trusting your manager as in artist.
“And for years, it was really toward the Jonas years, it was us against the world. We thought we knew everything and I think it’s because we’ve been doing it for so long and you sort of get comfortable in your own little world,” he said. “It’s really important to trust your team.”
This is something Jonas learned from his experience after his solo debut album, Fastlife, failed to take off in 2011.
“I can only speak for my personal experience, having a solo record that didn’t do well. It sold only maybe, a hundred thousand records and that was after a long period of time. That wasn’t really great, compared to what I had with my brothers. It was really screwing with my head, but I had to take a step back,” Jonas said.
Jonas reiterated the importance of trusting his team. 
 “Even the smallest things, it’s about trusting Republic and Charlie. I think for a lot of artists, especially new artists, a lot of times, they think they know everything,” Jonas said. “But when you walk into it, you have to take a step back. Obviously your art is very important, but these guys know what they’re doing.”
Toward the end of the forum, the duo took questions from students.
A student asked Jonas and Walk whether they believed success was defined as just selling out stadiums and millions of records, as mentioned throughout the talk, or if it was more than that.
 “When I was younger, the term was called ‘selling out,’ Jonas said. “There’s a big question: [Do] you want to create something that obviously you’re really proud of, you can play at a stadium and travel the world, sell millions of records, that’s obviously very exciting” Jonas said. “But there’s also, yeah, if you play at a small club in your hometown and you’re still really proud of your music that’s also really great. It’s whatever you want it to be.”

The plaque dedicated to Cesar Chavez, National Farm Workers Association founder and workers’ rights advocate, has occupied its current position on campus, a strip of grass between Bovard Auditorium and Taper Hall, since 1998. On Friday, the labor leader’s eldest son Fernando Chavez saw the memorial to his father for the first time during a visit to USC, in which he discussed activism, social justice and the legacy of his father’s campaign. 
Fernando Chavez, a civil rights activist and immigration lawyer, came to USC the day after Cesar Chavez’ birthday in an event hosted by El Centro Chicano as part of its Power Pan Dulce speaker series. He began by describing how, since his last visit to the University in the late 1980s, much has changed about the campus – most notably its racial and ethnic makeup, which has grown increasingly diverse. However, he also stressed that work remains to be done to achieve equality for Latinos in education.
“When I walked on this campus today, I was surprised at the diversity in the faces I saw,” Fernando Chavez said. “I think nevertheless that after so many years, those numbers need to go up. When you look at a city where over 50 percent of the population is Latino, you cannot have 12 percent Latinos in education.” 
The concept of education as a tool for progress, Fernando Chavez said, was important to his father, who never went to high school but read every book that he could get his hands on. Cesar Chavez led thousands of field workers in the 1960s and 1970s to demand benefits such as unemployment insurance by creating a union and organizing a boycott of grape growers. Cesar Chavez felt that his relative lack of schooling put him at a disadvantage when standing up to the agriculture industry, which historically took advantage of immigrant laborers by paying low wages with long working hours and poor working conditions.
“He took that industry on with nothing more than an eighth grade education and a belief that workers had a right to have dignity and respect,” Fernando Chavez said. “That was all he had.” 
What allowed Cesar Chavez to keep going despite the difficulty was an attitude of relentlessness, a lesson that Fernando Chavez said his father embodied and passed on to his children. Fernando Chavez recounted one of his earliest memories of his father’s activism, in which he refused to give up on holding community meetings despite the fact that no one attended. Eventually, he was able to mobilize a boycott that led to substantial improvements in working conditions, but achieving this outcome took time and determination, according to Fernando Chavez. 
“That lesson has never failed me, because it taught me the importance of being relentless in whatever you want to do,” Fernando Chavez said. “It’s a trait that is powerful for whatever you want to do in life – whether you want to be a CEO of a corporation, a community organizer, a physician. That concept is one that can assist all of us in our daily lives.” 
The idea of relentlessness drives many student groups who are trying to change the status quo for minorities in the present day, according to William Vela, the director of El Centro Chicano. Although progress has been made in addressing issues of discrimination on campus through legislation such as last semester’s Campus Climate Resolution, Vela said, students should look to Cesar Chavez’ activism as a model for community organizing if they want to continue the momentum. 
“I’m happy that the University has acknowledged [the campus climate issue] and is moving forward, but remember where that came from – it came from students,” Vela said. “It came from activism, it came from many of the principles that Fernando and his father and his family have. I think this is a great opportunity to discuss how can we move forward, what more is there to accomplish, and how can we do that together as a familia and as a Trojan Familia.” 
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the plaque dedicated to Cesar Chavez has been on campus since 1996. It was dedicated in 1998. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Think Travel; Not Vacation
Cabo, going home, skiing, San Diego — the list goes on and on when deciding on your spring break itinerary. Most likely, Cuba wasn’t on your list this year of spring break destinations, and without a little creativity, it wouldn’t have been on ours either. Our decision to travel to Cuba came to us about four months before break over the idea that we wanted to do something different. One of us, who had been to Cuba over three years ago in an overplanned tour-guided group through a curated section of the nation, said, “Why not go to Cuba? I’ve never actually experienced it.” We took his energy and excitement, combined them with our own curiosity and put some serious effort into researching and planning our trip. We knew that we wanted to see Havana, the largest city and capital of Cuba, but we also wanted to venture off the beaten path. A few areas that came to mind while combing through multiple travel guides were the cities of Vinales and Trinidad. Again, after additional research and planning, we felt somewhat comfortable with our itinerary.
During our travels, we combined our personal experiences to attempt to provide a figurative snapshot of Cuba. The first issue of address came from the obvious preparation efforts for the visit of President Barack Obama in Havana: The Cuban people’s regard toward their own political situation and how their culture is intertwined with many of the issues impeding progress today. Beyond local culture and politics, we felt it necessary to convey a few important reminders and tips about safety. Any country abroad is of slight risk to travelers; however, using your head and being aware of a few non-standard local practices is always helpful in feeling prepared and safe. Finally, one of the most obvious and unique parts of our trip were the sights. For all of the cliche references, Cuba literally is stuck in time. From ’50s era Chevys to Spanish colonial architecture, modern art deco and everything in between, the attractions, sights and scenery in Cuba were some of the most impressive events of our entire trip.
We hope that through our brief account of our stay in Cuba, you’ll share the same curiosity and excitement that we experienced during our time discovering this most unique spring break destination.
Politics and Culture
It’s impossible to visit Cuba without getting a taste of its current political climate. Cuba has been run by the Communist party since the 1960s and is currently governed by President Raul Castro. Unlike its more restricted and nationalist past, however, Castro recently began allowing Cuban citizens to own private businesses and even rent out rooms to tourists. These options give Cubans, who typically earn $45-60 per month, to make nearly the same amount in just one day.

During our trip, we stayed in some of these private rooms known as Casa Particulares which opened the door to more intimate and honest political discussions. And, even as tourists, we were able to experience multiple perspectives. One of our hosts pointed out the lack of a socio-economic class system in the country. The government ensures every Cuban receives the same rations, health care and resources they need to survive which brings everyone to a mostly uniform standard of living. Our host loved the this single class system because she believed it helped create a singular Cuban identity, and because everyone had what they needed, the political system drastically reduced the national crime rate.
On the other hand, we met other locals, a teacher and an IT worker, all of whom were fed up with their political system. They told us that giving everyone the same benefits, regardless of who actually works, creates free riders that slows their society’s progress.
Everyone we met was hospitable and kind. Even when we got stuck in a run-down, dangerous-looking place late at night, it honestly felt safer than most areas around USC. We also noticed the more relaxed pace of work as soon as we landed in the Havana airport — where we had to wait over two hours to exchange our currency because the tellers were socializing with one another. On a grander scale, there were large public projects and building renovations that were seemingly abandoned and covered in ivy as if the country had collectively given up on those projects. Regardless, Cuban society still functions in one of the most unique ways any of us had ever experienced.
Traveling safely
Though Cuba has a relatively low crime rate, there are still plenty of pickpockets, scammers and regulations to always be on the lookout for. To those planning on venturing to Cuba sometime in the near future, here is a list of things we came across that every traveler should be wary of:

Beyond the western Caribbean location of Cuba, the numerous valleys, mountain ranges, small harbors and urban colonial areas prove for a uniquely diverse and visual experience of the island. Our group visited three main cities: Havana, Vinales and Trinidad, all on the eastern half of Cuba, but also very different in scenery and local personalities.
Havana
The capital of Cuba, Havana, is home to numerous different sections of architectural theme. The oldest part of Havana (Habana Vieja) is home to numerous cathedrals and plazas, most of which were constructed near the then town’s inception in 1500. The overwhelming majority of these buildings display Spanish Deco architecture, while the more inhabited (and less frequented by tourists) areas to the west, such as Miramar and Vedado, are more modernized. A few top spots in Havana include:
Viñales
Viñales is a mountainous town located 140 km to the west of Havana, about a two hour’s drive on the Autopista Nacional, Cuba’s main cross-country interstate. With a population of 8,000, the quaint town features a vibrant downtown, complete with latin discotheques and eateries. The main attraction, however, lies just outside the town: numerous mogotes, or mountains, surround the area and attract visitors from all around. A few sights in particular: 
Trinidad
Trinidad was originally a Spanish Colonial settlement that still boasts its original 1800s architecture. About a four hour drive from Havana, Trinidad bordered by the Caribbean Sea. The city alone is enough to fill pages of sights, but other notable places include the nearby beaches and waterfalls:

The sheer size of Cuba affords travelers a great opportunity to view a myriad of sights, from white sand beaches to caves and rock formations. The easiest way to see as much as possible is do some research ahead of time, and also talk to locals. Ask around for not only the most popular or flashy spots, but also the places that locals frequent. In any case, do your best to have an open mind, take a step back and appreciate the amazing sights that Cuba has to offer.
