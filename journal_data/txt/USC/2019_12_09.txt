After sweeping Stephen F. Austin Friday, the USC women’s volleyball team was eliminated from the NCAA Tournament in the second round by No. 1 Baylor Saturday. 
USC rolled against the Lumberjacks, who entered with a record of 31-1 — but many of those wins came against weaker competition. USC proved to be the far superior team right out the gate, jumping ahead and never trailing in the match. 
Junior outside hitter Brooke Botkin supplemented a Trojan offense that has relied heavily on senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier for much of the season. Botkin returned from a month-long back injury in the regular-season finale and has provided a boost for the team ever since. 
She posted 17 kills to lead the team against SFA. 
“I think that we worked really hard this week to get our fast offense back,” Botkin said after the win. “We kind of slowed it down due to some injuries, and now we are going fast again, and that’s the kind of offense we want to run.”
The Trojans came up short against the Bears, 3-0, but two of the three matches were decided by 3 points or fewer. Throughout, though, Baylor proved to be the stronger and more consistent team. 
Baylor entered the match with a 26-1 record — its only loss to No. 4-overall Texas, whom they later beat — compared to USC’s 18-13. 
That gap was apparent all night, as Baylor outhit USC .323 to .271 and added 12 blocks, while USC had seven.
Poor serving in the first set put USC in a hole early on. Lanier had nine kills in the first set alone, and as a team, USC hit a remarkable .469 in the frame. USC even held a five-point lead at 17-12, but five service reception errors and three service errors allowed the Bears to climb back into the match.
USC wanted to slow down the top-ranked Baylor offensive attack and junior outside hitter Yossiana Pressley, an All-American honorable mention last year. She tallied 12 kills but hit a meager .171.
Still, in the second and third sets, Baylor improved its defense and was able to end the Trojans’ season.
This match finished Lanier’s historic career as a Trojan. Against Stephen F. Austin, Lanier picked up her 2,000th career kill, becoming just the fifth player in Pac-12 history to achieve 2,000 kills and 1,000 digs in a career. 
At the end of the season, USC’s final record stands at 18-14. From the start of the year until the loss to Baylor, the team could not muster much momentum or find any consistency. The Trojans were plagued by injuries all year long, a large reason the team’s record fell significantly from a 22-11 2018 season.

In a rematch of the 2018 NCAA Championship match, the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team fell 1 goal short of a 15th consecutive trip to the finals in a triple overtime showdown against No. 1 Stanford Saturday in Stockton.
The Trojans dug out of a 4-goal deficit after a shaky first half filled with missed opportunities. Cardinal redshirt junior 2-meter Ben Hallock and junior driver Tyler Abramson contributed to Stanford’s early lead and finished with 4 and 3 goals on the day, respectively. 
USC’s chances seemed slim after Abramson and sophomore driver Quinn Woodhead put together a 5-0 run in response to a goal by freshman driver Marcus Longton, which gave the Trojans a lead early on. 
Junior driver Jacob Mercep helped cut the difference to 3, but early in the fourth quarter Stanford created another scoring opportunity out of its 14th power-play of the game, bringing the score to 12-8. 
Despite losing sophomore 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt to a misconduct call early in the fourth, the rest of the Trojans’ scoring depth stepped up. Senior 2-meter Matt Maier began the comeback effort with a quick score from center, and sophomore driver Hannes Daube managed to send one to the back of the net before collecting his third and final ejection of the game. 
With the score 12-10 and a little over three minutes to go, Mercep picked up his fifth goal of the game. Just a second before the buzzer sounded, redshirt junior driver Luke Wyatt tied up the game to send it into overtime. 
“Until the whistle blows, we don’t stop for a second,” senior driver and captain Marin Dasic said in an interview with the L.A. Times. “We just kept going like its 0-0. We had hope. We had will.”
Mercep collected his third and final foul with a minute left in the first overtime period, leaving the Trojans without their top three scorers. 
A penalty shot block by sophomore goalie Nic Porter and Dasic’s second goal of the day gave the Trojans a 1-goal lead going into the second overtime period. 
The Trojans weren’t able to hold the advantage, though, as a quick goal from Woodhead brought the game into sudden death in front of a raucous crowd. 
Cardinal sophomore driver Spencer Hanson put the finishing touches on the back-and-forth battle, sending Stanford to the championship game with a 15-14 victory. 
Saturday’s thrilling semifinal marked the end of the Trojans’ tumultuous season and brought their overall record to 15-6. 
Head coach Marko Pintaric told the L.A. Times that falling just short of the final did not eclipse the work that the team had put in all season.
“When a team gives everything they have, which they did today, did they really lose?” Pintaric said. “So I’m very proud of this group [and] what they overcame.”
