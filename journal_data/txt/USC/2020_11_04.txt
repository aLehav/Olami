To help students navigate the emotions and stress of a divisive election season, Counseling and Mental Health Services in USC Student Health has offered election stress workshops. Student Health wants the workshops, led by faculty clinicians of the Department of Psychiatry of Behavioral Sciences at Keck School of Medicine, to create community among students during the isolation of the pandemic. 
The Daily Trojan spoke with Edden Agonafer, a psychologist and multicultural coordinator at Counseling and Mental Health, about the workshops and how students can navigate stress levels this coming week and the rest of the semester. 
The workshops began Oct. 26 and will continue through mid-November, with an extension depending on student demand. Students can sign up to attend through their MySHR portal. 
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Daily Trojan: Were there demands that resulted in the current workshops?
Edden Agonafer: There were no demands. We really wanted to be proactive this election year in making sure that we really thought about all of our students in general at USC. We wanted to just be proactive and think about these specific supportive spaces.
DT: Could you clarify a bit about the partnership with Student Equity and Inclusion?
EA: All of the cultural centers are under the Student Equity and Inclusion program, so we have a very good working relationship with them and each of their directors and so throughout the year we do a lot of programming and making sure that we provide services to students who are historically underrepresented or underserved. 
With this specific election year we got together just to think about what kind of services students can really benefit from. Part of the reason why we did that was that we didn’t want to assume what students needed without really checking in with a) students themselves and then b) also these leaders on campus that are doing a phenomenal job taking care of students.
DT: What have you noticed about students’ mental health during remote learning in the election season? Is there anything particularly unique that stood out to you?
EA: We are sort of a national trend and a lot of students are distressed. A lot of students are limited from being active and social so a lot of everything that you’re doing is done at home. The stress definitely has increased for some individuals and then for those who are already having their own unique challenges, whether that’s around relationships, academics, mental health, it just adds to that. That’s something that I’ve sort of been mindful of is that even as we’re asking people to work from home or be at home, what are the different barriers that we’re not really considering?
DT: Could you talk a little bit about how the workshops themselves are executed?
EA: During the workshop, students are expected to just have their feelings and thoughts validated around this election season, why it’s been so stressful [and] polarizing for a lot of individuals. 
We really focus a lot on coping strategies. How are people able to find hope? How are they able to really have a sense of control in what at times feels like there’s no control what’s happening? It’s there to engage community involvement, so for a lot of students who may feel isolated and alone and stressed out with the election and everything else, it’s just another opportunity for them to be with community, to have their feelings and thoughts validated and at the same time to learn about how to resilient and how to have faith in this really challenging time. 
DT: What have you observed as some of the general feelings among students attending?
EA: Students who usually attend are very grateful. It’s more so a space where you can say, ‘That makes a lot of sense why I’ve been feeling this way.’ So usually for our students who attend we get pretty good results. We don’t necessarily have a group size limit … so sometimes we have more students sign up some weeks or some days, maybe a little less, but even with those smaller groups, it’s been really effective. 
DT: What are some of the biggest stressors that students have shared about the election?
EA: We see every student with different beliefs, different ideas, different political affiliations so it’s really hard to say what’s one stressor. I think a lot of it just ties back to a lot of other social issues that we’ve been seeing but more importantly, how are people able to have hope. It’s not necessarily about the candidates they’re voting for but what’s coming up for them as they think about this election year.
DT: There will be more workshops following the election. Can you talk about your decision for extending them past Nov. 3?
EA: We won’t find out the official results until after a week or so, so students [will] still [be] stressed about the outcome of the election. We will also have a [community gathering] on Wednesday, so each day we’re really intentional on making sure that students have a space to be able to talk. We’ll have a post-election communal gathering space even up until the rest of the semester. Students may still be having mixed feelings or stressed out about the outcome so we want to make sure that that space is still available.
DT: What would you advise students to be doing to take care of themselves and manage stress around the election and politics, this week and in the future? 
EA: I often tell students to first of all pay attention to your stress signals [and] to what your body’s telling you. Pay attention to your emotions — they’re valid. 
Community’s huge and essential. A lot of people have been separated and scattered and trying to do school and work, but it’s important to seek community support so even if it’s on a phone, online, just having community is really helpful. 
Take breaks. We’re all really invested in learning about what’s going on, not just in the U.S. but around the world and it’s been really challenging year with the different news that you hear, as important as it is to stay plugged in, it’s also important to just unplug and give ourselves a mental health break and eat and sleep. There are a lot of committed staff at USC that really want you to be successful so we will never want you to feel alone.

With heavy political polarization present in the United States during the 2020 election, first time voters contributed to one of the highest voter turnouts since the early 1900s despite the coronavirus pandemic. According to Tuft University’s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning & Engagement, young and first-time voters ranked higher in every state since 2016. 
The Daily Trojan interviewed two USC students and an alumna to talk about their first-time voter experiences and casting their vote during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Emily Drysdale
Applying for her absentee ballot months in advance, Emily Drysdale did not think she would need to fly back to Fort Collins, Colo. to cast her ballot. But as a first-time voter in a presidential election, Drysdale was determined to make sure her voice was heard, and she worried ballots may not be delivered in time to be counted. 
“I was nervous from the start because of who’s in charge of USPS and nervous that corruption could affect my ability to vote,” said Drysdale, a sophomore majoring in computational neuroscience. “I don’t really feel reassured by my experience. I think, if anything, I’m more nervous. I had to go to pretty extreme measures to make sure I could vote.” 
Drysdale, like many college students and young people across the country, voted for the first time during this historic election, one defined by divisiveness and confusion amid the coronavirus pandemic.
By the last week in October, Drysdale still had not received her absentee ballot nearly three weeks after it was first mailed, so she went to the post office in hopes of finding it. There, workers found her address had been marked as invalid because it included a fraction, an issue some of her neighbors may have faced, as well. On top of that, she noticed many ballots arriving at her housing near campus were meant for other addresses, meaning some people could have missed their ballots.
When she received her ballot and tried to send it to her parents to place in a drop box, it didn’t arrive in time.
“My mom ended up calling about it … and they told her it was lost, and so she booked me a ticket to come back home to vote,” Drysdale said.
Her ballot ended up arriving at her parents’ house, where she dropped it in one of the boxes with little wait.
Following this experience, Drysdale also realized the obstacles that may stand in the way of people’s ability to cast their ballot. 
“I know a lot of people do not have the luxury to pay $80 for a plane ticket to fly back home to vote, so I’m definitely concerned that some people’s votes will not be counted or their voices will not be heard because of how difficult the process is,” she said. 
Although Drysdale managed to cast her vote on time, she is unhappy with the lengths she had to go through to have her voice heard. 
“I think because we are in a pandemic, we are sort of at the mercy of this system,” Drysdale said. “I feel like I had to risk infecting my parents and my family with COVID by flying back [home]. Because there was that sort of barrier, I had to rely on the Postal Service and government entities to participate, which is sort of unfortunate … I’m lucky I have parents who are committed and very happy to fly me home and potentially risk infection so that I can have a voice in politics.” 
Nicole Antounian
Voting for the first time was a family affair for Nicole Antounian, a junior majoring in journalism, as she always anticipated the moment that she could vote. Antounian cast her ballot in person for the first time this year along with her family in Burbank, Calif. 
“I’ve been waiting my whole life to vote. I did not wait a single second [longer],” Antounian said. “Your voice matters. My voice matters, and even if it’s just one vote, that’s better than no voting. I don’t want to just sit there during the election tonight and dread not voting. I don’t want to have any regrets. I did my part.”
Antounian was able to vote in person at her high school, where she had registered to vote a few years earlier during one of her government classes.
Prior to voting, Antounian decided on proposition measures alongside a guide she created as part of one of her journalism classes.
“Especially with what’s been going on, with social injustices that happened this past summer, like the Black Lives Matter movement and COVID and all this stuff, the candidates both have very polarizing views,” Antounian said. 
When her mother shared stories about voting, Antounian said it sounded like a fun outing with friends where they cast their votes and went out to eat after. Now, Antounian said the country feels too polarized to do so. 
Rayven Vinson
During the 2010 midterm elections, then-freshman Rayven Vinson from Baltimore faced different challenges as a first-time voter when she said she was turned away from a polling location in Marks Tower. 
Encouraged by campus efforts to register students to vote, including a campus visit from former President Barack Obama, Vinson was encouraged to make plans to cast her ballot and even waited in the long lines at the DMV location near USC to obtain a driver’s license to register to vote in California. 
Registered to vote as a California resident, Vinson entered the polling location in the residential apartments with plans to cast her ballot. However, she said she was unable to vote after a residential assistant helping at the location told Vinson she would be unable to vote due to her differing residential and local address. 
“It was disappointing and I remember, thinking back all these years later, about how much I wish the school would have walked [me] through it,” Vinson said. “The RAs tried their best but they’re also 19, 20, 21 years old, —they may have voted only once or twice before themselves. So it was this combination of feeling like I didn’t have the proper resources, my RA didn’t know, the school was making a big deal but wasn’t really involved.”
Nearly 10 years later, and with a wide range of experience as a special assistant in the United States Senate and work in the Bipartisan Policy Center, Vinson prepared months in advance for this election, casting her vote on the first day of early voting in Maryland after waiting in line for an hour and a half starting at 7 a.m. 
Although she did not end up fulfilling the role due to changing needs of the voting center, Vinson also signed up to volunteer as an election judge at her polling location to help take the role of older Black women who would be at greater risk for the coronavirus. According to the Pew Research Center, 58% of poll workers in 2018 were older than 61. 
During her time at USC, Vinson also recalled the general disconnect USC and its students had with the surrounding South Central community that also impacted whether they would be voting in elections. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 54% of South Central households make less than $50,000, with close to 27% of the residents below the poverty line. 
“At USC, unfortunately there is a lot of classism and elitism. Students tend to unfortunately not see themselves as part of the neighborhood, as part of the surrounding community. There does not seem to be an investment by the students to make sure that they are making their communities better,” Vinson said. “So when you don’t see yourself as [part of the community], why would you learn about ballot issues, learn who your city councilperson is … why would you take the time to vote given that situation?” 
Now that she’s out of college and feels more connected with her surrounding communities, Vinson said she has prioritized voting, and would vote despite her district being overwhelmingly blue and also identifying as a liberal. 
“I think when you live somewhere and you feel part of a community, it makes a big difference versus if you were at USC and kind of lollygagging and you feel like you’re part of the school, but you don’t feel like you’re a part of 90007,” Vinson said. 
Vinson also said that for voters who have more familiarity with the voting process, many do not understand the difficulties others may face with voter registration, long wait times at polls and removal from voting rolls. 
“Having experienced what I did at USC, I realized how many details really that you have to keep track and if you don’t it could allow you to slip through the cracks,” Vinson said. “Even though my experience was, not minor, but it wasn’t like I was aggressively turned away or what have you, it just opens your eyes to the fact that it is possible and it’s not people that are stupid that are being left off but it’s just innocent, everyday Americans who are just trying to do their civic duty and because of a mistake or misunderstanding, they’re not able to.” 
For future elections, Vinson said USC should lean into the idea of global citizens and encourage students to vote during all off-year elections and provide information on international elections, as well. Vinson said the University should help students navigate elections as many are first-time voters.
“Trust them that they can vote for whomever or on whatever, but I think it behooves them to at least get them all the way up to the polling location,” Vinson said.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Nicole Antounian voted using a dropbox, but she voted in person. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

The abortion rights movement has become an important milestone in the fight for women’s rights. Similar to the feminist wave to achieve equal voting access, the abortion rights movement uses catchy slogans, press coverage and generalized messaging to achieve mass support and understanding. Unfortunately, at the expense of being easily recognizable, the movement fails to achieve the intersectionality it intends. 
The abortion rights movement, although well-intentioned in nature and important, generalizes the experiences of women to rally the masses. This is at the cost of a comprehensive understanding of how race, class, sexuality, religion and more play a role in reproductive rights. In fact, many Black and Indigenous women, women of color, low income and queer women find that the mainstream abortion rights movement does not resonate with them because it neglects to explain how reproductive education, health and rights affect them differently.
Reproductive health refers to the medical side of women’s needs. Yes, this includes abortion access. However, it also encompasses the access to doctors without a need to worry about medical expenses, access to Plan B, access to testing such as mammograms, STD/HIV testing and even access to doctors for women who decide to have a child. These health factors are different for women who come from low-income communities since access to medicine is often expensive and, in some cases, not covered by insurance. There are also clear differences in how these factors impact religious women who support access to reproductive medical support and for women of color and queer women who may not need an abortion but still need support.
This is also the case for reproductive education, in particular reproductive rights, which refers to the legal protection of the right to access and decision-making. In regards to education, not many women receive sexual education that is inclusive for their individual identity such as sexuality. Black and Latina women are also more likely than white women to obtain an abortion, which may be a result of unintended pregnancy due to lack of sex education access. 
Reproductive rights go far beyond a right to an abortion. This idea seems to be the point of disconnect between the goals of the movement and what women actually need. 
The abortion rights movement forgets there are still barriers to access that are necessary to respond to for all women to fully have a choice. These barriers and recognition of women’s needs do not currently fit into the notion of abortion rights. This comes at the expense of women who may need reproductive protections the most. This disconnect has not gone unrecognized by some human rights movements, many of which have amplified the need for reproductive justice — which encompasses the intersectional aspect of women’s rights — over simply amplifying the abortion-rights message. 
The importance of the abortion rights movement is undeniable. Yet if women don’t see themselves in this mainstream movement that continues to sacrifice intersectionality for the sake of popularity, then this fight for choice becomes divided. Ultimately, this contributes to similar outcomes as the first feminist wave, where white women’s rights came at the expense of those of women of color. Such a division widens the gap of the movement and misses key players in effective reproductive policy making.
The abortion rights movement cannot continue to dismiss the necessity for nuance and intersectionality and generalize the experiences of all women without accounting for how reproductive health varies as a function of race and income, among other factors. It is crucial that these distinctions are highlighted, rather than relegated to the margins of the movement, if there is any hope of substantive, meaningful change.

I have said it many times before, and I will say it again: The current mental health stigma reduction movement is shallow. 
Every time another person ends their life, the conversation always surrounds “checking in on your loved ones” and “seeking help before it’s too late.” Stigma reduction education and mental health advocacy help reduce stigma, but pop culture too often dilutes the systemic issues that contribute to mental illness and suicide, such as homelessness. 
The movement also undermines the criminalization of mental illness. With election season in full swing, the media has brushed over the story of Walter Wallace Jr. On Oct. 26, Philadelphia officers shot Wallace Jr. multiple times when they were responding to a 911 call from his family. Wallace Jr. was experiencing a mental health crisis and the shooting took place just three days after he was discharged from a mental health crisis treatment center. According to the Philadelphia police commissioner, the police department also lacks a behavioral health unit and a way to coordinate police calls with medical specialists.
This tragedy serves as an unfortunate reminder that people with psychiatric illnesses are criminalized, maltreated and dehumanized in the modern carceral state. Ultimately, this prompts further discussion about the dissemination of funding to police departments. In order to work toward decriminalizing psychiatric illness, the police must be defunded nationwide to provide appropriate funding for mental health emergency services. 
Approaching this issue from a broader perspective, psychiatric illness has been historically criminalized since ancient Greece, where it was perceived as the “manifestation of evil spirits.” Today, the media exaggerates the role of mental illness in violent crimes — people with mental illness are actually more likely to be victims of violent crime than the perpetrators. Prisons and jails are now the nation’s largest psychiatric facilities, with approximately 10% of prisoners having a severe psychiatric illness. 
This does not mean that prisons are the largest psychiatric treatment facilities. The criminal justice system simply funnels people with psychiatric illnesses through jails and prisons with inadequate mental health care, after they are arrested due to symptoms of their mental illness. Studies have found that people with serious brain disorders are actually four times more likely to be arrested for disorderly conduct and threats than people without a mental illness. Plus, the risk of death from police intervention for people with mental illness is seven times greater than people without a mental illness.
This inequity among people with mental illness prompts a necessary reevaluation of the police’s role in mental health calls. In response to the current push to defund the police, activists offer social workers and mental health professionals as alternatives for mental health calls and other situations where the police lack appropriate training. However, defunding the police would be ineffective without acknowledging carceral social work. 
In a study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, researchers identify carceral social work as social work’s collaboration with the police to uphold white supremacy and manage marginalized communities across different social work arenas, including mental health intervention. Virtually, carceral social work promotes collaboration between law enforcement and social workers as vital, but it ultimately feeds into the broader carceral state.   
If we want to defund the police in order to decriminalize mental illness, anti-carceral social work must be implemented. We cannot defund the police without having a plan to fund programs that do not perpetuate the current criminalization of psychiatric illness, nor continually abuse inmates with mental illness. It would make no sense — mental health calls would be handled by mental health professionals, but people who suffer from psychiatric illness would still be vulnerable to the nightmare of the carceral state. 
For a possible solution, the study proposed that social workers engage in workshops that educate them about the intertwining of policing in health care so they can develop crisis intervention skills and protect vulnerable communities, just as the Oakland Powers Project does. Defunding the police means funding programs such as this, which would diminish drastic mental health inequities and build trust within the communities most impacted by police brutality. 
One final note: Although this column will be published after election day, I am writing it before. If Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins, this is one prime example of how he must be held accountable. In their statement responding to the senseless death of Walter Wallace Jr., Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris dedicated more than half of it to condemning looting. Property should not be more valuable than human lives, but society continually treats it as such. We simply cannot afford this shallow thinking anymore.

Sports are deeply ingrained in Pilipinx culture. Basketball courts and makeshift hoops are spotted all over the Philippines and match days for Pilipinx boxers are treated like national holidays. 
But despite the deep love Pilipinos have for sports, they are not widely represented in sports media internationally. As Pilipinx American History Month has come to a close, four Pilipina USC athletes reflected on how they strive to increase representation.
Sophomore Eryn Cayetano and fifth-year senior graduate Angela Kulikov’s paths crossed well before their time as doubles partners for the USC women’s tennis team. By the time Cayetano was 7 and Kulikov was 10, both were picked up by the United States Tennis Association, the national governing body for tennis, and its Player Development program, which funnels the next generation of U.S. tennis stars through to the big leagues. Since then, Angela started calling Eryn her “mini me.” Recognizing that there are not many Pilipinx Americans playing tennis, Eryn considers Angela to be her role model.
For fifth-year senior graduate golfer Allisen Corpuz, as a Pilipina Korean, she found herself looking up to women that looked like her since her childhood. She was especially inspired by Jennifer Rosales, a Pilipina professional golfer and former Trojan currently playing on the LPGA Tour.
“My dad was a big fan of her,” Corpuz said. “Then I became a big fan of her, just because she’s Filipina, growing up. And same thing for the Korean golfers — Inbee Park and Se-ri Pak.”
As the first Pilipina Hawaiian on the USC women’s soccer team, the lack of Pilipinx representation particularly in soccer pushes freshman defender Anuhea Kane to work hard and excel.
“It just motivates me more to want to make something of myself further down the line for a Filipino Hawaiian,” Kane said. “It’s so hard to find that connection around the world.” 
Corpuz wants to follow in the footsteps of Pilipinx athletes like Rosales to provide another role model for the Pilipinx community — and USC has always been where she wanted to do that. With Corpuz’s dad receiving two degrees from USC, his love for the school passed down to Allisen.
“I’ve learned so much, and I’ve met so many great people,” Corpuz said. “I definitely feel like I’m a much better player than I was coming onto campus. Overall, it’s been a period of a lot of growth for me, and I’ve just had such a fun time at USC.” 
With the highs, unfortunately, trials inevitably come along the way. Just last week, Kane tore her ACL during training. While extremely grateful for the opportunities and support being on the women’s soccer team has given her, her time as a student-athlete has been “a roller coaster” thus far. Coming in as an early enrollee last spring, adjusting to crazy schedules and her recent injury have posed significant challenges.
Kulikov felt this pressure placed on student-athletes as well. When she committed to USC, the women’s tennis team was ranked No. 1 in the country. As she began her time as a Trojan, she found herself in the middle of the program’s rebuilding phase.
“I felt this pressure that if I got here when things kind of fell apart, I need to be a reason that we at least started heading back in the direction of restoring this legacy that USC women’s tennis is meant to be,” Kulikov said.
With these challenges that student-athletes face in addition to the lack of Pilipinos in sports, these Pilipina Trojan athletes sought out a supportive community beyond the athletics realm. Last semester, both Kane and Cayetano joined USC Troy Philippines —  the University’s only Pilipinx club.
“I knew I needed Troy Phi because the athletic world is so different, it’s so hard for people that aren’t involved with it to understand it,” Kane said. “Our schedules are crazy … but I still wanted to enjoy the Troy Phi events. Thursday night was Troy Phi, but Friday morning was training. But I still made it work because I need to balance my life.” 
Cayetano spoke similarly of her experience with Troy Phi.
“It was definitely tough for me because I grew up in Long Beach, Calif., which is a very diverse area and I grew up with a lot of Filipinos,” Cayetano said. “The Filipino culture is very strong with their values, culture and this idea of a community. It was tough to find that in the athletic world … so I joined Troy Phi to feel that community again.” 
By seeking out a support system outside of their sports teams, these Trojan athletes saw the roles of their sports and Pilipinx communities as separate. However, they were also able to clearly see how their identities as a Pilipina and as an athlete intersect. For all of them, they hold specific Pilipinx values close to heart and carry their culture by living them out.
“Loyalty has always been a huge thing for me. Consideration for others before consideration for yourself has always just been driven into me,” Kulikov said. “I never really knew where these came from. So it really wasn’t until I got to engage with other Filipinos that I started to see. Oh, they have it too! No wonder! It’s a Filipino value.”
Corpuz said that her Pilipinx and Korean cultures help keep her grounded.
“I think all Asian communities are a little different because there is … that sense of community and really connecting with others and giving back. Not that that’s not an American value, but I feel like it’s very much emphasized in Filipino and Korean culture as well,” Corpuz said. “It’s helped me to be a lot more balanced — just not taking golf too seriously and just knowing that at the end of the day, I still have my family and I still have my friends.”
Though similar in their shared Pilipinx culture, Kulikov, Kane, Corpuz and Cayetano have all had unique journeys to where they are now as student-athletes. However, as they all aspire to play at the professional level in the future, they are united in wanting to use their platforms to create positive change. 
Kulikov sees a much bigger purpose to sports aside from entertainment. In addition to wanting to change the narratives and break down harmful stereotypes surrounding female athletes, she also feels a natural call to advocate for the destigmatization of mental health as an applied psychology major.
As a defender standing at 5 feet tall, Kane wants to show Pilipinx Hawaiian athletes that seemingly disadvantageous physical traits will not hinder them from reaching their dreams. She wants to share the message that through hard work and determination, she was able to reach her full potential.
With the presence of Asian women golfers on the professional circuit inspiring Corpuz from an early age, she believes in the power of representation.
“It makes it easier to visualize yourself in that position if they look like you,” Corpuz said. “There’s so many girls out there that might not even realize it is something they want, so I definitely just want to be a role model, whether it’s on or off the course.”
Just like how Kulikov has been a mentor and role model to her, Cayetano hopes to do the same as she is already striving to build relationships with young Pilipinx tennis players today. In April, Cayetano spent her time in quarantine stringing and donating tennis rackets and supplies to young athletes in the Philippines who lacked sufficient equipment. 
With her platform, she hopes to increase the representation of Pilipinos in the sports world for the next generation of Pilipinx athletes to look up to and to uplift the Pilipinx community and provide a sense of pride. 
“As long as I’m able to touch the lives of some, I hope it touches the lives of many in the future,” Cayetano said.

With winter break on the horizon, finding shows and movies you can enjoy while wrapping up finals is a must. Whether you want to get into the holiday spirit early or simply cozy up on colder nights for a movie marathon, here are some great options for films and television shows coming to streaming platforms this month.
Netflix
“Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas”Coming to Netflix Nov. 18, “Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas” stars Benjamin Bradley, an interior designer, playfully dubbed “Mr. Christmas.” Bradley works with a design team to help families prepare and decorate their homes’ interiors for the holidays. Here’s to hoping it provides some joy like many HGTV home renovation series have before.
“Jingle Jangle”Coming to Netflix Nov. 13, this musical movie has fans hoping it can become a Christmas classic — granted it lives up to the excitement built up around it from Netflix’s promotional campaigns beginning in early fall. Jeronicus Jangle (Forest Whitaker) is a toymaker who gains a new sense of joy about his job when his granddaughter comes into his life. While only the trailers have been released, watching it seems to be the only way to find out if it lives up to expectations.
Hulu
“Christmas Cookie Challenge”As a huge fan of “The Great British Baking Show,” any other competition show about sweets feels like it can’t quite compare. Regardless, this new series is fitting for the holiday season. Hopefully, others can relate to spending winter break watching food competition shows all day without planning on it. This time around, I’m optimistic about implementing some of these baking techniques and I hope you are too.
“I Am Greta”Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg has become a household name after her climate change activism gained worldwide attention. This documentary acknowledges her activism and explains what led to the impact she has had today. Additionally, the documentary captures moments that remind the viewer of the fact she is a 15-year-old girl. One of these moments is Thunberg dancing without a care in the world — reminding viewers that even when the weight of the world is on your shoulders, it is okay to act your age.
Amazon Prime Video
“Borat Subsequent Moviefilm”If you’re looking for some levity, this movie is sure to provide it. Sasha Baron Cohen pokes fun at current events, like the coronavirus and political happenings, making Borat fans excited for the reinstatement of the controversial character. President Donald Trump and other administration members are also featured in the film — played by actors, not the real politicians for the most part — creating some comedy about one of the most unconventional political administrations ever seen.
“Dead Poets Society”Watching this movie either at the beginning or end of a semester feels right, mainly because it helps viewers think about their schooling and what they really want to do with their lives. Not in the way that your parents do — but in a way that’s completely on your own accord. Allow yourself to get introspective with English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) and what unfolds as the “Dead Poets Society” is re-established at Welton Academy.
AppleTV+
“A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving”Charlie Brown and the gang are sure to bring a smile to your face with their antics while preparing for a Thanksgiving meal. Believe it or not, the classic holiday tale will no longer air on national television. Instead, it can be found on AppleTV+. Thankfully, the streaming service will allow nonsubscribers to view the cartoon movie from Nov. 25-27 for free. The movie itself was made in 1973 so it’s important to keep that in mind as you watch their portrayal of the Thanksgiving story in the second half. Many students can say this film is part of their childhood so including it felt like reuniting with an old friend.
Disney+
“The Mandalorian”For all of you who love binge-watching shows and movies on a Friday night, this TV show may be a bit more difficult to get into because its episodes are released on a weekly basis. The first season in its entirety is out, but season two just started releasing episodes Oct. 30. Watching should provide clarity for the Baby Yoda/The Child craze but it’s up to personal interpretation whether or not you buy into it. Regardless of that, the production quality is great (the main reason why it is on this list) and should please anyone who is a “Star Wars” fan.

Let me tell you about the other day. I was standing in the shower, letting lukewarm water run down my face dramatically and thinking about the freshman Halloween experience I didn’t get this year, when suddenly, my Spotify played “What Makes You Beautiful.”
I didn’t know how to react. I hadn’t heard that song in years. Memories of middle school flooded through me instantly. I tasted Fruit by the Foot and Babybel Cheese circles. I felt the tight scrunchie on my scalp that I wore to try to look like Ariana Grande. I felt 12 years old again.
Picture it: It’s 2012, and you’re sitting in your room under your One Direction fleece blanket, staring at your 12 feet by 16 feet poster of Harry Styles and spraying your PINK by Victoria’s Secret perfume on every single thing in your room. Life is good.
OK, snap out of it. It’s not 2012; it’s 2020, a year we can collectively agree to call the literal worst year ever. Every time you think it couldn’t be any worse, it gets worse. But I don’t mean to be negative. This year really sucks. But you know what doesn’t? One Direction.
In sixth grade, I started every single day by listening to 1D on my way to school, and then again when I did my homework, then again in the shower and then again before I went to sleep — every day. My mother begged me to stop playing it in my room. Every time we went on a family trip, the AUX mysteriously skipped me since no one else in my family was a Directioner. Everyone told me it was just a phase. But they were wrong. How could I ever “get over” One Direction? My mind couldn’t wrap itself around the concept.
I’m really not sure when exactly the obsession stopped. Maybe it was when I stopped going to Claire’s every week. Or when I decided I was too cool to wear Skechers to school. Sometime between my tweenage years and my adolescence, the sticker of Harry Styles on my iPod Touch fell off, and I didn’t really care.
Alright, so back to the other day. I hopped out of the shower and queued every One Direction song I could remember. It was the classic tweenage moment. Dancing around my bathroom, I pretended I was in a music video, using my hairbrush as a mic, flipping my hair back and forth and overall not having a care in the world. I felt like Taylor Swift in the “You Belong With Me” video (pre-glow up).
Five hours later, I realized that it was 3 in the morning, and I hadn’t done anything I was supposed to. And strangely, it didn’t make me anxious at all. Even through my sleep deprivation, my One Direction high kept me happy through the next day.
Over the next couple of days, it became a sort of ritual. Whenever I felt overwhelmed by school or wanted a break, I put in my earphones and blasted One Direction until the stress subsided or my ears started to hurt, whichever came first. But every day, I vibed a little less.
Even I have to admit that eventually, it got kinda old. Listening to the same songs over and over just didn’t feel the same as it did the first time, and the calming powers of Zayn’s voice diminished exponentially over time. I tried to force myself to enjoy it. I wanted to get back that feeling of nostalgia for the happy, easy times. I wanted to dance in my bathroom for five hours. But it never came. The more I tried to force myself to listen to it, the more I slowly started to hate it, so I decided to stop before I could ruin it for myself forever.
I guess what I’m trying to say is: It really was just a phase. But that’s OK. That’s pretty much the whole point of a boy band. You listen, you gush over them, you move on. It’s the circle of life. Who knows, maybe in another five years I’ll relapse again into the One Direction drain. And amid a global pandemic, how much more can we ask for?

If I had a dollar for every time I have been asked “What are you?” I would be extremely well-off. As a biracial woman who is half Black and half Japanese, my appearance is quite racially ambiguous, which leads many people to question my race and where I am from.
Now, I understand that most of the time, these people are genuinely asking out of curiosity with no ill intentions because they simply cannot make the assumption. However, as the person on the receiving end of this question, I often feel both confused and upset that I have to explain my identity to someone I hardly know. For a long time, questions regarding my race and background have led me to question who I was or “what” I was. 
Having my race and identity constantly questioned made me really start hating that I couldn’t just be one race to avoid being asked the same question over and over again. On top of this, I felt even more conflicted because I resented that I couldn’t even accept myself for who I was. I hated that I had conceded to an indistinguishable foe.
Along with the dilemma of racial identity, I have struggled with another problem that truly held me down. It’s the problem that I had the hardest time coming to terms with: the unavoidable reality that I will inevitably continue to face conflict with both of my racial communities. 
Within the Black community I am not considered to have the Black experience, nor am I “fully” Black. On the other hand, I am never seen as Japanese from a Japanese person’s perspective, so I’m often not “accepted” within the Japanese community — again, because I am not “fully” Japanese. 
This concept truly hurt and hindered the development of my identity, as I never felt a sense of belonging, faced with apprehensive thoughts wondering if I would ever belong anywhere. I always wanted to belong to a community and ultimately be accepted for who I was. 
As time went on, the hope for that reality diminished. Although that sounds quite downcast, it was a great turning point in my life. Letting go of the desire to be accepted and fit in is what set me on my current journey of self-acceptance and forming my “true” identity.
These back-and-forth internal disputes lasted from my elementary school days all the way until my junior year of college, which was just last year. As I mentioned, I was always trying to find a place to fit in and be accepted. That fight ended when I took a class here at USC taught by Julie Rousseau, who I now revere, called “Identity Development of the Contemporary Female.” 
In this class, we heavily covered the concept of intersectionality. Before taking the class, I didn’t know what intersectionality meant; better yet, I had never heard of the term before. For those who don’t know, like I once didn’t, intersectionality is “a lens through which you can see where power comes and collides, where it interlocks and intersects,” according to Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge in their book “Intersectionality.” 
In simpler terms, I interpret intersectionality as the many different aspects that form an individual. In my case, I am a cisgender woman, a biracial woman, a Black woman, a Japanese woman, an athlete, a friend, a daughter, a sister, a teammate and truly whatever I want to be. I have come to terms with the idea that I can be more than just one thing. This concept and ideology has helped me understand that I don’t necessarily need to belong or be accepted into every single group that I am a part of. I know I am unique in my own ways and will naturally find places where I can find my own happiness.
Sports have personally played a huge and extremely integral role in this process of self-acceptance and embracing my identity. Since the age of 5, I have been involved in many different sports: gymnastics, soccer, tennis, basketball, swimming, track and field and volleyball. 
Within these sports, I have experienced varying styles of teaching, met many different people from different backgrounds and cultures and experienced things that I don’t think one can encounter outside of athletics.
Life is too short to dwell on something that I personally have no control over (my race), so I have begun to see life for what it is and what I can make of it. I hope that I can help encourage others to similarly take hold of their life, take advantage of their uniqueness and see the undeniable beauty within themselves.
