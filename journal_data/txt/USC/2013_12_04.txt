Pechmann is a professor of marketing at the Paul Merage School of Business at the University of California, Irvine. She has received nearly $1.5 million in grants to study anti-smoking advertising and adolescents. Pechmann also assists the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy in overseeing a multi-year, anti-drug advertising campaign.
Pechmann discussed  different types of “big data” and the differences between macrotargeting and large-scale microtargeting. She also applied her marketing and data perspective to online communities and spoke about how online communities are used by social media, health groups, the government, nonprofits, firms, brand and user groups and sports and affinity groups.
Pechmann said that online communities are unique because of their small participant size and the limited duration of most online conversations.
“My goal was to help governments, nonprofits and forums to create engaging online communities to help people quit smoking,” Pechmann said.
Pechmann proceeded to talk about how she created online Twitter communities as support groups to help people quit smoking. She described a setup of how she would test out communities of different sizes. Pechmann said she eventually discovered that a support group of approximately 25 people was the most effective at retaining members of the group.
“Online communities are such a huge part of our lives so having a role model in an online community can be beneficial to smokers,” said Ha-Rim Choi, a sophomore majoring in business administration who attended the event.
Pechmann also discussed how creating automated messages to facilitate discussion was an extremely effective and cost-efficient method to drastically increase the retention rates of a support group on Twitter for the three month trial times of each testing period.
“I think the idea definitely has potential because of how attached we are to social media and online communities,” said Albert Yue, a freshman majoring in computer science (games). “However, not having the physical connection or communication that traditional support groups provide is definitely a challenge that needs to be addressed. I think if this was used to supplement traditional support groups it could be very powerful.”
Pechmann expressed the difficulty in finding the “holy grail” of online communities, where community members were engaged and formed relationships that lasted longer than the length of the conversation itself. Students had mixed opinions on this idea.
“I don’t think that it would help as much as people meeting together in person, because tweeting is so passive and isn’t a really dominant aspect of people’s lives,” said Elliot Kim, a freshman majoring in economics.
Many students, however, still said they believe that Pechmann has an innovative idea that could definitely be expanded into something more.
“It sounds like it would be really cool,” said William Anderson, a freshman majoring in game design and interactive media. “Support groups like that tend to work well since people can talk about stuff without actually having the pressure admitting their problem to someone in person.”

On Wednesday, students and faculty gathered to discuss the causes, implications and results of global climate change in a seminar called “Adapting to Global Climate Change: The Local Politics of Coping with a Global Problem.” The event was part of the USC Center for International Studies seminar series, which seeks to bring international affairs and research to USC students.
Warming world · Professor Mark A. Boyer speaks to students and faculty about northeastern municipalities’ policy efforts to combat climate change at a seminar at the Social Sciences Building on Wednesday afternoon. – Dasha Kholodenko | Daily Trojan
Mark A. Boyer, a Board of Trustees distinguished professor of political science from the University of Connecticut, hosted the event. The seminar aimed to analyze local and regional policy efforts on climate adaptation. Boyer drew on policy data collected from municipalities in Connecticut and extensive interview data from across the northeastern policy community to show how localities are grappling with this global problem.
During his presentation, Boyer described his research, the motivations behind his work and the outcomes of his discoveries. Boyer began the seminar by giving the example of Hurricane Sandy’s effect on coastal towns in New Jersey in order to prove the importance of appropriate environmental policy and what can happen without it. California and New England are the most progressive areas in the country in terms of environmental policy change, and this makes them both prime to study, Boyer said. Boyer focused his work on 169 Connecticut municipalities, and used methodology that included both data collection and interview testimony.
“Documents, journalistic accounts, other secondary sources only give part of the picture,” Boyer said. “The only way to understand the coordination and efficiency questions is to talk to the people doing work on the ground.”
Boyer emphasized that there are two important elements in his research. The first is mitigation, which is the reduction of potential threats, such as greenhouse gases. The second is adaptation, which is activity that increases the resistance and/or resilience of a system.
In his research, Boyer found that funding is primarily a barrier to creating better mitigation and adaptation policies, as well as climate threat and state policies dictated by the wealthy who own the land. Global climate change policy is slowed and stalled, but Boyer was able to see direct results on a local level.
“From a public goods perspective, the efficient locus of policy change is at the lower level,” Boyer said. “The problem that is the real constraint in the local level is the budget.”
Boyer’s talk is part of a larger effort by USC to promote climate change awareness. Program coordinator Indira Persad said that this issue is important to be aware of.
“The mission of CIS is ‘promote advanced research and critical debate of theoretical and policy issues in world affairs,’ and Boyer’s work on the local politics of climate change does just that,” Persad said. “Issues surrounding the topic of climate change can be controversial because there are no easy solutions. But, the more we talk about these issues and get things out in the open, the closer we are to finding solutions to these problems.”
Many students attended the lecture to enrich their understanding and knowledge of climate change.
“I’m interested in environmental policies and mitigation, so this deals directly with what I want to write for my dissertation,” said Hai-Vu Phan, a Ph.D. candidate in political science and international relations. “I can use Boyer as a resource for when I’m working on my dissertation that examines environmental policies in different countries to find out why they are effective or ineffective, to figure out what will be effective in environmental policies.”
Other students with less knowledge of the topic attended to learn about Boyer’s brand new research.
“Being a freshman here at USC, I am very interested in expanding my knowledge,” said Paige Hines, a freshman majoring in environmental studies. “I like getting a broader and more diverse understanding of current topics involved in my major.”
Boyer said he hopes that there will be a movement of less skepticism toward climate change, and improved efforts to address climate change in the future. Persad believes college-aged students will be key to this movement.
“USC students can best help by educating themselves about climate change, and keeping an open mind when hearing debates or ideas about how to deal with the problems associated with it,” Persad said.

An electrical panel caught on fire Wednesday afternoon in the basement of the Ostrow School of Dentistry.
Mike Mulvehill, interim associate dean of clinical affairs, said an electrical panel caught fire in the basement and blew out something in the main unit.

“It was about 3:30 p.m.,” Mulvehill said. “I was at my desk in my office and everything just went black.”
The basement and first floor were evacuated first. Fourth-year dentistry graduate student Sophia Kang was on the second floor waiting to give a patient an X-ray when the power turned off.
“The power just went out completely on our floor. We were up there for about 10 to 15 minutes,” Kang said. “First floor people started to evacuate but no one told us to evacuate on the second floor. Then the fire alarm rang so everyone came out.”
Third-year dentistry graduate student Chris Fanelli said he had a patient in the chair when the power went out, but that people did not panic.
“We wanted to make sure the patients were safe,” Fanelli said. “That was of the utmost priority, and so we calmly and orderly evacuated the school. The professors did a great job keeping everyone calm and keeping us updated as best they could.”
Dental students were gradually allowed to re-enter, dispose of their used instruments and collect their belongings. Yi Ko, a third-year dentistry graduate student, said clinic was canceled for the remainder of the day, and patients already undergoing a procedure were told to visit the faculty in practice at the Engemann Student Health Center.
Updated on Dec. 6th at 9:03 a.m.
According to an email sent by Dean Avishai Sadan, Thursday morning clinic sessions and classes are also canceled.

Program Board recently introduced their newest cultural organization, the Environmental Student Assembly. This organization will be the ninth cultural organization established under Program Board.
Justin Bogda, the executive director of the Political Student Assembly, said establishing a new assembly will help better support the environmental student organizations already present on campus, including Environmental Affairs Organization, SC Outfitters, Global Environmental Brigades, USC Just Food and Gardening, Sue Chang Trojans and USC Energy Club.
“Since I also work for Program Board, I thought it was the best idea and way to get additional funding and support for student groups to create an assembly where we could get money to actually fund these organizations,” Bogda said. “If you can provide them with resources, you really can get them to come together.”
Bogda said the idea to establish ESA came to fruition when he was organizing last year’s Earth Week.
“The idea started in January and February last year, when I was organizing Earth Week,” Bogda said. “And when I was working with all these student groups I saw that none of them knew about each other and none of them connected to each other … so there’s a clear problem there, and it kind of fixed itself. [The planning] kind of organized itself into an assembly.”
One of the main purposes of ESA is to draw in more environmentally interested students toward specific programs.
“We have a lot of programs through the Office of Sustainability but little capacity to involve students in them … It was the goal of the office to become more accessible to students with its programs, and the main way to do that was through our Earth Week,” Bogda said. “In working with all these student groups it just came to be this perfect model because Program Board is the way that the student government is organized to organize all groups around a specific interest … [and] to come together and collaborate.”
Shawn Rhoads, a sophomore majoring in physics and psychology, and sophomores Caitlin Martin and Alison Pugash, both majoring in environmental studies, were voted by the member organizations to lead ESA as their first executive board. Rhoads will serve as the executive director of ESA, and Martin and Pugash will assume the roles of assistant directors.
“When I decided to run for executive director, I really thought about what are some ways I can bring green programming on campus and develop the green culture at USC,” Rhoads said. “I feel like doing this gives me an opportunity to have a direct affect on what we do and visibly show what we are doing, increase other people’s interest and awareness about the initiatives that are going on.”
Martin said she felt becoming a part of ESA would give her an idea of what she wanted to become involved in the future.
“I want to go into environmental public policy at some point, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn how to work with different people and become involved,” Martin said. “I just really wanted to do something that would actually make a difference.”
Many students said they believe that starting ESA will have a beneficial impact on the university community.
“[The environment] seems like an issue that hasn’t been addressed yet, but [ESA] will fill that void that is left,” said Kelsey Goelz, a senior majoring in art history and public relations. “I think it will be really useful, especially to bring other environmental groups on campus together and be an umbrella for them.”
Several students said they think that ESA will finally cause the university to start focusing on more ecofriendly practices.
“I think starting ESA is a great idea,” said Megan Park, a sophomore majoring in art. “I think there’s a lot of impact that USC students can make on conserving energy by having environmentally concerned debates and informative events that I haven’t seen yet for the two years that I’ve been here.”
Bogda also said he hopes that the new assembly will spread conservation awareness around campus, as well as make a greater impact on the university by advocating for more environmentally friendly legislation.
“For activism to get things passed through administration, you need to show that there is student support for those kinds of things,” Bogda said. “So if it’s a bunch of different groups that aren’t organized for a common goal, you aren’t going to get the thousand signatures that you might need. But if you have a group that is organizing it … then you can get things accomplished.

ArchDaily recently commended the School of Architecture’s program for bridging the gap between theory and practice.
ArchDaily’s report was based on rankings by DesignIntelligence, which released rankings of architecture schools in the United States in November. In DesignIntelligence’s rankings, the School of Architecture undergraduate program placed seventh in the country.

This ranking was a significant advancement for the school, which was ranked 16th last year and had not broken the top ten in the past eight years.
DesignIntelligence, the chief source of rankings for architecture and design schools, also ranked schools in specific categories, including Cross-Disciplinary Teamwork, Communication, Design, Research and Theory, Construction Methods and Materials, and Sustainable Design Practices and Principles. Of these six categories, USC placed in the top five for five of the categories.
ArchDaily grouped the categories into two groups: design and theory, and practical construction and sustainability. USC was the only school to have placed in the top five of categories in both groups.
“The University of Southern California seems to be producing uniquely balanced architects … this university may be one to watch in the future,” the ArchDaily article said.
In order to rank these schools, Greenway Group surveyed an array of individuals related to architectural academics. Six hundred and ninety-three professional practices and corporations were surveyed, an almost 250 percent increase from the 282 firms that responded in 2013. To add depth to the results, 89 deans and chairs of architecture schools were asked what they thought were weighing issues facing architectural instructors today and 2,760 architecture students were asked about their satisfaction with their architectural schooling.
Joseph Cohan, a fourth-year architecture student, agreed that DesignIntelligence’s rankings reflect the diversity of the USC architecture program.
“I’m pretty grateful that we learn about sustainability and cost,” Cohan said. “We learn about each of the parts of design as opposed to schools like Berkeley, which is heavily sustainable, or Harvard, which doesn’t take cost or sustainability into account.”
Bryan Sandoval, a junior majoring in business administration and architecture, was most impressed with the School of Architecture’s use of technology and integrating it into architectural practices.
“Many schools stick with traditional methods and drawing, but at USC, it’s about being able to translate anything from paper onto a computer,” Sandoval said.
The USC School of Architecture features many interdisciplinary programs. One of these majors is civil engineering with an emphasis in building science, a program that involves both the Viterbi School of Engineering and the School of Architecture. This major “involves all stages of designing a building, from formulating the original conceptualization to creating drawings for construction,” according to the Viterbi website.
Noah Cherner, a sophomore in the building science program, said he is grateful for the opportunity to prepare early for the realities of the architecture world, but more importantly, he noted that USC has taught him to treat every design like it is a personalized gift.
“At USC, it’s not just about design or making a product that you can mass produce … at USC, they really emphasize making something sacred,” Cherner said.
Sandoval said one thing that makes the School of Architecture distinct is the unique backgrounds of the faculty and staff that contribute to their architectural tastes. He recalled that one of his professors did her undergraduate work in literature, but continued on to get her graduate degree in architecture.
“Different backgrounds make for different perspectives and professors are encouraging all different types of architecture,” Sandoval said.
Cherner credited the School of Architecture’s high ranking to the faculty at USC who encourage their students to work hard and constantly challenge themselves.
“I think [this ranking] really sheds light on the amount of work that the architecture students at USC put in … It shows that USC has amazing architecture faculty that want to push their students to the limit,” Cherner said.

The Dept. of Public Safety has undergone some dramatic changes in the past year and officers say the rebranding will continue.

Beginning Jan. 1, all armed DPS officers — those who are Police Academy-trained and can issue arrests — will begin wearing blue uniforms rather than the tan and green ones the department currently dons.
John Thomas, who will mark the end of his first year as DPS chief this January, said blue uniforms are standard for law-enforcement agencies and thus easier to order. They also help create uniformity within the department and will feature an official USC Dept. of Public Safety patch as opposed to the current uniforms, which feature the university seal.
“It’s really hard to get consistency when you have a two tone uniform with the green and the tan,” Thomas said. “One of the things that was important to me was that we as a department be perceived by students and the community in a more professional manner and I wanted to rebrand the department in such a way where when people see DPS officers they’re not seeing what they’ve become accustomed to because we’re going in a new and better direction, trying to be more customer-focused and community-oriented.”
As part of his efforts to shift the role of DPS in the community, Thomas chose to add more supervisory personnel administrative staff and create two deputy chief positions at the beginning of this academic year.
“When I was selected as chief, one of the things that was clear to me was that we needed to reorganize the department, but also in that reorganization we needed to add more administrative support and more supervisory oversight to our officers working in the field to provide,” Thomas said. “We want a better quality product for the people that we serve, which is primarily students.”
Deputy chief John Adams previously worked at UCLA before beginning at USC this fall. Adams has worked closely with leadership on The Row to ensure that students safely engage in recreational activities and make an effort to drink responsibly. Adams meets with leadership from the Greek community every Monday to debrief and review incident logs from the previous week.
“When I came on board, I saw the issue and went directly to those leaders in that area to talk with them on a regular basis and it’s worked out very well,” Adams said. “We have a nice mutually collaborative environment. I can get their opinions and bring them back to the chief.”
With input from student groups, Thomas and Adams came up with the idea of a party response car, which is currently a group of three officers tasked with responding to all calls about parties or noise complaints.
“We have designated these as the officers we expect are going to build a relationship [with students],” Thomas said. “They are going to be the ones that respond to noise complaints and loud music complaints and all those other issues so that students get used to dealing with the same individuals.”
Thomas also emphasized the need to work with students on future measures.
“The only way we’re going to be successful in this is if we put together policies that have student input,” Thomas said. “Students made it very clear that the administration can put together policies but if [students] don’t have a buy-in and it doesn’t make sense to them and it’s not collaborative, students are just going to find a way to go around it. We don’t want that — we want it to be successful, we want students to have a buy-in and a sense of knowing that we appreciate an respect their input.”
Deputy Chief David Carlisle, a past captain of DPS, assumed his new position as part of the reorganization at the beginning of the school year. Carlisle said that this fall’s Thursday night football game — the first non-Thanksgiving regular season Thursday game in USC history — proved how out-of-hand parties can get when students do not comply with university policies.
“The need for those types of dialogues and the improvement in policies and relationships was emphasized on our first Thursday night home game where the university said there would be no tailgating and yet there was unlimited tailgating on The Row,” Carlisle said. “It pointed out the fact that sometimes the message isn’t getting across and how things can get out of control in regards to obeying the rules of conduct here at the university.”
Now that football season is over, however, officers will no longer be responsible for managing thousands of non-USC students on campus, in the Coliseum and in the surrounding neighborhoods. Thomas said he suspects and hopes that there will be fewer parties and alcohol transports in the spring semester. In this case, DPS could use its resources elsewhere, such as through adding another officer to the party response team or preparing more for spring events.
“We immediately see students are buckling down and are more focused in a lot of ways toward what they have to do to graduate,” Thomas said. “But it’s busy for us on another front because we have to start planning for commencement and [the Los Angeles Times] Festival of Books and the Special Olympics this summer.”
Though several large events are slated for spring, DPS has also seen an unusually large number of high-profile guests this fall, including former President George W. Bush, first lady Laura Bush, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Gen. David Petraeus, all of whom required increased security and collaboration with federal officers.
Moving forward, DPS must also find a way to adapt to USC’s continuing plan for expansion of the university’s properties. USC recently acquired the Verdugo Hills Hospital in the Glendale area. Now, the hospital is looking to USC for public safety services in an area don’t they normally respond to.
“That is a challenge in terms of personnel and in terms of communication such as radios,” Carlisle said. “As [USC] expands so may DPS’ role in providing the same level of service to those far away facilities.”

The way I see this and read it, is that these students you are speaking of are all adults. Under 21 or not all of the by an order of the Defense Secretary  of the United States of America and passed By the Congress of the same and signed into law by the President  can serve and die for our Country, 
 My belief is the DPS is there to protect these said adults from outside influences that can harm them or their property. It is less 10% of the population that is the problem, while the 90% gets the shaft. So stand back and remember when you were a young adult, and be there for support and help and not the old neighbor who forever complained get your dog off my lawn. 
As for blue uniforms it sounds to me you either want to blend in with the LAPD or allow them to blend in with you. Your jobs are to support the students not scare them into submission remember, history has proven that Police states never survive, and you can earn more respect from all people good or bad by being respectful and honest so call it what you will, Law enforcement all around the country wear different uniforms so it is not the ease of buying blue but the fact that you want to blend in or have them blend in so that it is harder to know which agency is stepping in. 
I personally would like to see a better security force keeping the outside/negative influences off campus and out of the USC property area and less heavy hand control over the majority of good students that attend the finest university in the country.
Blue uniforms sounds like a bad idea.  Not excited to feel like campus is being constantly patrolled by Police.  I fear new students will have the wrong message, and be more afraid of DPS.
Fire up the paddy wagon boys, we’re heading to The Row!
Yes, it’s important to work with the student groups, and continue to keep the communication open.  It is unrealistic to think that the students won’t party…what we don’t want is students  to go ” underground,” or be hesitant to seek aid for student’s who need medical attention.
Adams said, “Students made it very clear that the administration can put together policies but if [students] don’t have a buy-in and it doesn’t make sense to them and it’s not collaborative, students are just going to find a way to go around it. –
Adams needs to help Beth Saul and others develop approaches and policies beyond wide extremes of “look the other way” and “lockdown Thursdays”. Adams seems knowledgeable about positive behavior change strategies. Students not only need to be collaborative, but to be the “first responders”– to self-regulate. 
No doubt students and Adams can develop a strategy that provides ample freedom to Greek houses and independent students who maintain fun, but prosocial behavior, but also a series of graduated restrictions for Greek houses and students who are consistent repeat offenders.
With the shutdown of on-campus Thursday Row parties and USC allowing off-campus bussing to downtown party venues, the destructive “as long as I can’t see it it is ok” policy continues to the potential peril of students in off campus venues.
Adams as well as the on-staff psychologists and counselors need to be included to help student services administrators develop a working knowledge of how to create constructive behavior change among young adults.
LOL, “party response vehicle.”  Ladies and gentlemen, we officially have a “fun police.”
We’d better at least go up in the USNWR rankings for this…

USC’s men’s and women’s swim teams are headed off to the Lone Star State this weekend to compete in the Texas Invitational in Austin, Tex.
Starting gun · Last year, the Women of Troy won the Texas Invitational when it was called the USA Swimming Winter National Championships. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
The tournament will mark the first time the swimmers have competed since early November, when they, along with their diving teammates, swept Arizona and Arizona State to maintain an undefeated fall season.
Senior Meghan Hawthorne impressed on the women’s side, winning four combined individual events against the Wildcats and Sun Devils, while senior Dimitri Colupaev stepped up for the men’s team, also winning four individual events. Seniors Kasey Carlson and Stina Gardell, along with sophomores Kendyl Stewart and Jasmine Tosky, have also been instrumental in leading the women’s team to success, and juniors Cristian Quintero and Luca Spinazzola have complemented Colupaev’s success on the men’s side.
Last year, the annual Texas Invitational was called the USA Swimming Winter National Championships. The Women of Troy won the event, while the men’s team took third.
At the Texas Invitational this weekend, USC will face competitors from Texas, BYU, Arizona, UC Santa Barbara, Wisconsin, Harvard, Penn State, University of the Incarnate Word and Oklahoma Baptist — the winners of last year’s National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics championship. UCLA will also compete, but only on the women’s side.
USC’s women’s team enters the tournament ranked No. 6 in the nation by the College Swimming Coaches Association of America, while the men are ranked No. 7. Texas and Arizona are the only other ranked men’s squads, at No. 4 and No. 15, respectively. On the women’s side, Arizona is ranked No. 13, UCLA is ranked No. 19 and Penn State is ranked No. 24.
Though the tournament comprises individual competitions, USC will be sending nearly its whole team to compete. The meet will feature all 18 of the swimming events contested at the NCAA championships, so it provides a great chance for the Trojans to sharpen their skills after a fairly light fall season.
The Texas Invitational begins Thursday and runs until Saturday.

After going 1-2 in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament in the Bahamas last week, USC’s men’s basketball team returns home to the Galen Center this weekend to try and maintain their spotless home record against Boston College.
Breakout · Senior point guard Pe’Shon Howard isn’t known for his offensive explosivness, but the Maryland transfer led the Trojans with 17.7 points per game in the Battle 4 Atlantis over Thanksgiving. – Corey Marquitti | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (5-3) took its share of lickings at the hands of Villanova and Wake Forest in the Battle 4 Atlantis, but were able to rebound in the tournament’s final day with an 84-78 victory over Xavier.
Head coach Andy Enfield’s team was given some time this week to review the game tapes from the blowout losses in preparation for the visiting Boston College Eagles this weekend.
USC did not fare particularly well against another ACC foe in the Demon Deacons from Wake Forest, and looked completely out of sorts offensively. The lackluster play of senior center Omar Oraby was especially troubling.
Through the first five games of the season, Oraby seemed to be on his way to the breakout season USC fans were hoping for when he transferred from Rice last year. But in the Battle 4 Atlantis, the Cairo, Egypt native averaged just 4.7 points and 5.3 rebounds per game.
Senior point guard Pe’Shon Howard filled the void on offense for the Trojans, averaging 17.7 points while in the Bahamas.
Howard will hope to carry over that offensive outburst into USC’s showdown with Boston College (3-5), who has struggled thus far but boasts two dangerous scorers.
Guard Olivier Hanlan (21.7 points per game) and forward Ryan Anderson (19.0 points, 7.1 rebounds per game) carry the load offensively for the Eagles, while sophomore guard Joe Rahon chips in 13.4 points per game. No other player averages more than 6.0 points per contest, but the Eagles still manage to put up a robust 78.3 points per game.
Boston College does, however, struggle to keep their opponents off the board. The Eagles have only held one opponent (Sacred Heart) below 70 points, and have let up more than 80 points in half of their games.
That bodes well for the Trojans, who have excelled in lighting up the scoreboard (75.5 points per game). But they haven’t exactly been efficient, converting 45 percent of their field-goal attempts.
The defense has also been porous at times — the 94 points USC gave up to Villanova last week set a Battle 4 Atlantis tournament record, and the team has held just three opponents below the 70-point mark. Fortunately, all three of those matchups occurred at the Galen Center, giving the Trojans hope that they might have the foundation for a solid home-court advantage.
The Trojans tip off against the Eagles on Sunday at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center. The game will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.

One can only imagine the range of extreme emotions that coursed through the John McKay Center on Monday as the news of Steve Sarkisian’s hiring and Ed Orgeron’s subsequent resignation developed throughout the day. After Orgeron addressed the team for a final time that afternoon, you didn’t even have to be in there to see some of those emotions as players and coaches left the building.
The way it happened was awful. Monday will surely go down as one of the wildest days in the history of the USC football program — even crazier than the day Lane Kiffin was fired at 4:30 a.m. I would like to say the whole situation could have been handled more tactfully, but with emotions running as high as they were I’m not sure how feasible that really was.
I don’t know if Steve Sarkisian is the right hire — only time will tell. But I do believe that, between Coach Sark and Coach O, Sarkisian was the better choice.
Look, what “Coach O” did with this team was tremendously impressive. Coming from a lot of coaches, the whole “team is family” shtick could be lumped in with all of their other cliches. But you couldn’t even call it a “shtick” with Orgeron. He truly meant it.
In my very first column of the year, I wrote this about Ed Orgeron: “You would be hard-pressed to find a member of the football program, athletic department or even the Trojan Family with more ‘Trojan Spirit’ than the man they call Coach O.”
I still believe that. Athletic Director Pat Haden was right in saying that “Ed [Orgeron] is one of the greatest Trojans ever.” To criticize the man for “walking out” on this team is not only wrong, it is hypocritical. It’s not far-fetched to say there would be no “team” to “walk out” on if it weren’t for Orgeron.
He brought emotion. He brought passion. He brought, as he promised, “fun” back to USC football. For the short term, that was exactly what was needed. There was a contagious energy around the program, and a renewed sense of confidence to go with it. Coach O deserves rightful praise for that. As many people — myself included — said when he was first appointed interim head coach, he was the perfect man for that job.
But just because you’re the perfect man for the next few months doesn’t mean you’re the perfect man for the next few years.
Saturday against UCLA, the Trojans’ energy finally ran out. Orgeron admitted it, and so did players. It’s unheard of for a team to run out of energy during a rivalry game, but that’s exactly what happened. And it’s easy to see why.
You cannot win on energy and emotion alone, and yet that is what USC relied on — with fairly decent success — in its eight games under Coach O. But as the UCLA game proved, that cannot last forever. At a certain point, you have to simply be better than your opponents to win. You have to be better prepared, better coached and have the energy it takes to win. USC was 0-for-3 in those categories on Saturday.
There seems to be a fairly widespread belief that had USC knocked off the Bruins on Saturday, Orgeron would have been introduced as the full-time head coach and not asked to step back down. I find this very, very difficult to believe. If one game — an important game, but one game nonetheless — were to make that much of a difference, Haden’s hiring process would have been seriously flawed. It would reflect the same short-sighted mindset of those who wanted Orgeron hired full-time.
“USC will lose recruits,” they say. “The players wanted Orgeron.”
The former is mere speculation, and with the hiring of Sarkisian, probably false. But the latter is true. It stings right now. The team is hurting. The fans are hurting. Even people, like me, who didn’t believe Orgeron should be retained are hurting. It’s more than understandable. But give it time. Think about it rationally. This was the better choice for USC football as a program.
I think it is safe to say that Orgeron’s eight games as the head coach of USC football won’t be forgotten, nor should they be. From an emotional standpoint, who wouldn’t want him to stay on as head coach? But there would have been few, if any, logical reasons for it. And while I do wish he stayed on as an assistant, there is an undeniable level of irrationality to that. He was the associate head coach at USC while both Sarkisian and Kiffin were mere position coaches. He already coached under one of them, and could hardly be expected to do so again.
Of course the situation is less than ideal. In hindsight, it would have been nice if Sarkisian had accepted former Athletic Director Mike Garrett’s offer to fill the void left by Pete Carroll, as Carroll apparently wanted. Then there would have been no Lane Kiffin, no head coach Orgeron and no hurting in the way this program is hurting right now.
But take a step back from the emotion. Think about the situation USC is in. Think about all of the reasons for Orgeron to stay on that don’t have to do with raw sentiment. If you manage to think of one, please let me know. My contact information is below.
 
“Any Given Saturday” ran on Thursdays, ironically. To explain to Nick how this makes no sense, or why you think Coach O should have been hired, email him at burtonn@usc.edu, yell at him on twitter @NickMBurton or visit dailytrojan.com.
 
Please talk to the football team and ask them to be prepared and have the passion and focus of the Stanford game for this bowl game. Do not, please do not let this bowl game against Fresno State be a travesty like last years game against Georgia Tech.  Nothing against farmers, but in this case, we need to beat this farmer area team. They have not played anybody great, but I remember a game with R. Bush and company down here and we had our hands full of these guys. Do not embarass yourselves Trojans by taking a dump on this bowl game. Everything that Coach O restored for the last part of the season will be diminished if we lay an egg against the farm school from the Valley. Do not take these people lightly. This is the perfect opportunity for this Fresno team to feel they are equal to a USC by beating us because we we not interested in this game. Coach O and staff and collective effort by this team got us to be able to play in a post season game, don’t screw it up!
Coach O. brought winning back to USC football, players playing at their best level and fans uniting behind the team. He brought the human qualities that inspired players to trust themselves, each other and Coach O. He offered a model for all administrators and professors on campus.
i completely disagree This article grossly trivializes the impact Coach O. had with our Trojan community by identifying “emotion” as the ingredient Coach O. added. Even worse emotion is portrayed as a passing thrill, like a carnival ride.
What Coach O accomplished was motivating our players to trust themselves each other and him with the result they played at their full potential. 
I suggest Nick interview the players and ask what went wrong at the UCLA game, why did they look relatively flat. I suspect the team realized since Coach O was not named the Head Coach after an extraordinary USC performance and win over Stanford and with ongoing interviews of other coaches that Coach O. was not going to be hired as the Head Coach.That is, if the players are allowed to talk about it as they were not allowed to talk to the media after the final  meeting Coach O. 
Nick you just don’t get it.
As a former Marshall student, I thought it was nonsensical when I came across the assertion of something like, “promoting from within is the best policy when a firm is facing dire consequences.” Or, “selecting a CEO from within…” This was in a lot of business strategy class readings. I disagree, however. It’s better to hire someone from the outside instead of dwelling on past success, believing that it can be revived through an insider….Succinctly put, the Pete Carroll era is over. You cannot revive this dead horse via Sarkisian. He didn’t do anything special at UW. He is not the panacea to the ailing football program…But I hope I’m wrong.

With the 2013 season in the books, Daily Trojan columnists Will Laws, Euno Lee, Nick Burton, Jacob Freedman, Jake Davidson and Luke Holthouse weigh in on USC’s performance thus far.
Sark! The Haden Angels Sing · Athletic Director Pat Haden tabbed Washington’s Steve Sarkisian as the Trojans’ next head football oaach. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Q: What grade would you give USC’s season?
Freedman: B. USC was headed for an ugly GPA, but Ed Orgeron got the team back on track. This year was never expected to be one ending in a BCS Title or Rose Bowl berth, and USC ended up being in contention until the next-to-last week of their campaign. Wins over Stanford and Oregon State were surprising, but the stench of Kiffin’s five games couldn’t give the Trojans a stellar mark.
Holthouse: C-. A 69.2 winning percentage would warrant a D+ in most classrooms, but I’ll round up for effort. A W in the Trojan’s bowl game would bump my grade up to a C. I really thought this team had a chance at the Pac-12 South, but the team got embarrassed by both ASU and UCLA. The Stanford win was awesome, but otherwise, this feels like a failed season.
Davidson: B+. This season played out like the kid who flunks his first midterm and then rallies from there, exceeding all expectations but at the end of the day it was too little, too late. It was an exciting and unique season which showcased the tremendous power of the USC brand, but it wasn’t successful in the conventional sense.
 
Q: What grade would you give the Sarkisian hire?
Lee: A. USC did their best with the available options. Sarkisian is a quarterbacks guy, and he’ll have a five-star recruit with outstanding field vision to develop in Max Browne. It’s the least sexy hire, but Sarkisian already displays far more maturity and perspective than Kiffin.
Burton: B. I’ll admit, I was hell-bent on Boise State coach Chris Petersen, who I am a big fan of. But after him, I think Sark is probably the next best option. All the talk of how Kiffin was as, if not more, successful at USC than Sarkisian was at Washington completely ignores the fact that USC is USC and Washington is Washington and that’s sort of what’s supposed to happen. He is a strong Xs and Os coach — like Kiffin — but he can also connect with his players — unlike Kiffin.
Laws: B+. The Trojan faithful were hungry for a big-name hire — but USC has never been in that business. John McKay, John Robinson and Pete Carroll all had zero head coaching experience at the college level when they were hired, and Carroll was the only one to have been head coach at any level in uninspiring stints with the Patriots and Jets. Sarkisian has shown the ability to turn around a program, holds deep recruiting roots on the West Coast and is infinitely more personable than Lane Kiffin. I like his chances to get USC another Rose Bowl banner within the next three years.
 
Q: Of the candidates who were widely reported to be in contention for the head coaching job, who would you have hired?
 
Freedman: Of the candidates we know interviewed (Sarkisian, Orgeron, Petersen and former USC linebacker Jack Del Rio), Haden made the right choice. I, however, would have hired Kevin Sumlin, assuming his interview would have been as impressive as his coaching resume. Sumlin has revolutionized offense while at Texas A&M, and his unconventional system would have flourished with the type of talent he would have recruited at USC. The complaints of defensive issues would have been solved by USC being able to afford a (or keep their) top-notch coordinator.
Laws: I was all in on Petersen. He’s a consistent winner (.885 winning percentage) and an innovative playcaller who would’ve kept Pac-12 counterparts on their toes. Alas, all reports indicate that Petersen wasn’t quite ready for the intense scrutiny that comes with coaching in Los Angeles. So it was probably for the best that he stays in Idaho.
Lee: My gut and emotion says we should have kept Orgeron and install a big-time offensive coordinator/playcaller underneath him to help Kessler/Browne develop. In all seriousness, I would have equally loved making a splash with Jon Gruden, just to see what happens. But Sarkisian was the safest choice and the best strategic decision. Pat Haden’s hire makes a lot more sense in hindsight, even if many of the Trojan faithful (including myself) are disappointed to see Coach O go.
 
Q: Who was the team’s MVP?
Holthouse: Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler. Without a doubt, the biggest question mark coming into the season was the quarterback situation, but he was perfectly reliable all year once he took over the starting job. His completion percentage was good, his turnovers were low and he should come back much better next year.
Lee: It’s not a sexy answer, but sophomore defensive lineman Leonard Williams — and it’s not even close. Leonard “The Lion” Williams is the anchor of USC’s terrifying front seven, and he has demanded constant attention and devoured opposing offensive line attention on every snap. Offensive linemen can’t contain him, running backs don’t want to face him. His performance against Stanford’s vaunted run offense was undeniable, and every other running back that’s faced USC this season is either studying harder to consider other career options or filling out Burger King applications.
Burton: I am so very torn here. Redshirt junior defensive back Josh Shaw was arguably the most irreplaceable player on the team, switching positions to aid a bleeding secondary. Leonard Williams played much of the season with a possibly torn labrum and racked up 13.5 tackles for loss and six sacks. But I have to go with redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard. He led the team in tackles and was the quarterback of what was generally a very stout defense. In his three years here he’s been either first or second in tackles on the team. And no, I did not consider an offense player. Not even Buck Allen.
 
Q: Which players do you think will leave early for the NFL Draft?
Davidson: Dion Bailey. Marqise Lee. George Uko. Hayes Pullard. Xavier Grimble … possibly more. The combination of a rocky season, the departure of Coach O and Nickell Robey’s success as an undrafted early entree might sway more players than normal.
Laws: It’s probably best for Lee to cut his losses and accept the late first-round projection he’ll likely receive. And at the risk of reading too much into a small thing, Bailey introduced himself as a senior in his video introduction at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before the UCLA game despite his redshirt junior status. Even though his role was reduced this year, he still led the team with five interceptions. I think he’s gone, too. But Shaw and Pullard have both tried to warm their teammates up to the idea of playing under Sarkisian, so it figures that they’ll stay one more year. Grimble, Randall Telfer and junior center Marcus Martin would all be wise to spend another season at USC to rebuild their value after each had injuries affect their 2013 campaigns.
Burton: These players have been through way more than anyone bargains for when you pick a school like USC. I think the better question is who will stay? I don’t think I would, it’s all just been too much. Marqise Lee is gone. I think Pullard and Dion Bailey are too. Pullard is NFL-ready and Bailey saw his role diminished this year. George Uko is likewise NFL-ready, and the loss of Orgeron hurt the defensive line more than any other position group. I imagine he’s gone as well. To me the big three questions are tight ends Randall Telfer and Xavier Grimble and defensive back Josh Shaw. Telfer and Grimble were both hampered by injuries this season and would do well to stay another year. Shaw is hard to project because of his position switching. He might also want to stay on one more year for stability.

The USC men’s water polo team, following their Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament title, will be heading to Palo Alto this weekend to try and win an unprecedented sixth straight national championship.
Legend · Senior driver Nikola Vavic already holds USC’s all-time scoring record (248 goals), but is still playing for his fourth career national title. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
By virtue of their MPSF tournament triumph, the Trojans were awarded the No. 1 overall seed in the tournament for a stunning ninth consecutive year, which should be a benefit for them going forward.
The Trojans finished with four losses, an unusually high number for the national powerhouse, but were able to gain some momentum in the conference tournament by sweeping three straight matches, culminating in the 10-8 championship game victory over Stanford.
Palo Alto is a fitting site for the Trojans to potentially capture their sixth straight national title, as Stanford also hosted the NCAA Tournament in 2008 when USC won its first championship and kicked off this historic run.
USC will play their first game Saturday against the winner of the play-in game between No. 4-seeded UC San Diego (14-13) and No. 5-seeded St. Francis Brooklyn (22-10).
If the Trojans avoid what would be a massive upset in the semifinals, they will likely compete in the finals against either No. 2-seeded Pacific (22-4) or No. 3-seeded Stanford (21-5), who must first dispose of No. 6-seeded Whittier (19-12) in a play-in game.
The NCAA bracket usually plays out as a series of rematches between MPSF powerhouses. But since the tournament also gives out automatic bids to the champions of less competitive conferences, there are typically a few formidable teams from the MPSF who get left out of the field.
Luckily for the Trojans, one of those teams this year is their crosstown rival UCLA (28-4), who defeated them twice. The Bruins suffered just as many losses as USC, but their defeats came at a far more crucial time. UCLA lost its last two games of the season in the MPSF tournament, each by one goal to Stanford and Pacific, dooming them to a fourth-place finish that left them just short of the NCAA field.
USC, meanwhile, will appear in the NCAA tournament for the 28th time, giving the Trojans the most NCAA appearances in the history of the sport.
Aside from being ranked tops in the NCAA tournament, USC also finds itself in the familiar position of No. 1 overall in the nation. The Trojans entered the year ranked No. 1, but lost that spot with a midseason loss to the Bruins.
Earlier this week, senior driver Nikola Vavic was named the MPSF conference player of the year for the second straight season. USC’s all-time goal leader won the award after netting 75 goals for the Trojans this season, the fifth-highest mark in the conference. Vavic enters his final weekend of collegiate play with 248 career goals.
Vavic will try to finish out his time at USC with another championship, and if he is able to do so, the head coach’s son will go down as one of the most decorated athletes in water polo history. If he records five more goals this weekend, it’ll be the second straight year Vavic will have eclipsed the 80-goal mark after totaling 83 last season. Only seven other MPSF players have ever recorded 80 goals.
If the Trojans do clinch their six straight title, it’ll break their tie with the UCLA women’s team for most consecutive championships won by any collegiate water polo team.

There’s an ear-deafening energy that can only be experienced firsthand from a premier loudspeaker system that can vibrate bass through one’s veins. Digital outlets such as online streaming and social media updates sometimes serve to dampen the concert-going experience. But Beyonce was not made for a computer screen.

For fans who missed Beyoncé’s first two performances in Los Angeles earlier this summer, the music superstar delivered a third concert that somehow managed to eclipse those critically lauded performances. Though the concert did not sell out, it drew in some of Los Angeles’ biggest names including Samuel L. Jackson and Magic Johnson. This third and final L.A. run of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour warmed up a cold Tuesday night with shooting flames, sizzling performers, pyrotechnics and simply raw talent.
Opening performer Luke James commanded attention with an energetic medley of his own songs along with covers of famous R&B hits. His short 20-minute opening ended with an amazing falsetto, creating a memorable, lingering tune that satisfied the fans who were waiting for the star of the show to arrive.
The 40-minute gap between the opening and main performance felt like an eternity. Finally, the lights dimmed and an uproar of cheers echoed throug the stadium as a large video screen descended from the main stage. Beyoncé demands as much energy from the crowd as she puts in. She would not sing until she felt the crowd gave her enough noise, and Mrs. Carter alone would have the power to control when her concert ended.
In “End of Time,” Beyoncé and her dancers switched between subtle sensuality and sharp power moves with suggestive hip movements which eventually gave way to elbow jabs and hair twirls. More importantly, Beyoncé’s mind-blowing sense of rhythm turned the crowd into a sea of screams as she sang “End of Time” while matching her female dancers shake for shake and stomp for stomp.
Videos played during costume changes, but took up too much of the two-hour concert. At the end of the initial video, Beyoncé wasted no time and jumped right into “Run the World (Girls),” a performance that showed her power, humility and Beyoncé’s signature smile.
Despite her status as a diva, the show felt well-balanced as Queen Bey drew attention away from herself, allowing her crew, her friends and her fans to shine in the limelight. Like a true queen, she was fair, kind and humble, giving a shout-out to former Destiny’s Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams during the crowd pleaser “Survivor.”
As Beyoncé emerged for her final song, a hush fell over the crowd as she sang a mash-up of “I Will Always Love You” and “Halo,” dedicating her encore to the late Paul Walker.
Despite critiques, the concert was not Superbowl 2.0. Instead, it was a marriage of a fashion show with world-class choreography and enough fireworks to put Disneyland’s Fantasmic! to shame.
One of the main problems was time. Too many of the songs were shortened to fit a total of 22 songs in under two hours. Her latest songs such as “Run the World,” “End of Time” and “Grown Woman” received full plays but too many of the others were cut too short. Most songs had enough breadth to sing along to but not enough for the crowd to bathe in the afterglow. And though the set list was the same as her summer tour’s, Beyoncé’s revamped visual and vocal performance left Los Angeles “Crazy in Love.”

Enchanted Handmade
Center for the Arts, Eagle Rock. 2225 Colorado Blvd., Los Angeles, CA
Dec. 8, 11 a.m. – 4 p.m.
When it comes to gifts, there’s a saying that it’s the thought that counts. For lots of people that usually means hand-making something. But who even has time to hand-paint greeting cards or make something by hand anymore? Artsy people and hipsters, that’s who. This weekend, get ready to meet both of these types of people at the Center for the Arts, Eagle Rock for Enchanted Handmade. Enchanted Handmade is a marketplace for — you guessed it — handmade goods, ranging from tea cups to jewelry and textiles and more. So if you’re going to just throw money at your gift-giving problems this year, why not throw your money at something handmade?
A Noise Within’s A Christmas Carol
3352 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA
Dec. 7-8, 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. and one rogue 7 p.m. seating runs various dates through Dec. 22
Pasadena theater company A Noise Within is putting on its second production of A Christmas Carol in time for the holidays. Tickets start at $60, but don’t be an Ebenezer Scrooge! Take a date or your family’s Tiny Tim, or get a large group together for discounted rates. This year’s cast features Geoff Elliot as Ebenezer Scrooge and Stephen Rockwell as Mr. Cratchit. Dec. 8 will also be the day of Fezziwig’s Festive Holiday Tea, a fundraising event to benefit ANW’s education programs. Enjoy some tea at 2 p.m. the magic of the Charles Dickens classic brought to life without the mess of overwrought, gaudy sentence structure.
KIIS FM Jingle Ball
Staples Center, 1111 S. Figueroa St., Los Angeles, CA
Dec. 6, 7:30 p.m.
She came in like a … Jingle Ball? Miley Cyrus is in town for KIIS FM’s Jingle Ball, and this year’s lineup of the Top-40 radio station’s annual holiday music festival reads like a who’s who of pop music in 2013: Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Selena Gomez, Robin Thicke and Ariana Grande are all slated to perform. But you know — and Euno knows — the real reason to go to Jingle Ball has something to do with a certain daughter of a now-disgraced country singer. So put some J’s on your feet and get, like, really ratchet at the Staples Center this weekend.
Jay Z at the Honda Center
Honda Center, 2695 E. Katella Ave., Anaheim, CA
Dec. 6, 8 p.m.
If you’re not about the wrecking balls and more about balling so hard that, well, other people have to find you, Jay Z is coming to the Honda Center for a show as part of his Magna Carter (get it? Magna “Carter?”) World Tour. But if you’re having money problems, we feel bad for you, son: scalped floor tickets are edging closer to $400. But if “Money Ain’t a Thang,” then don’t pop molly, do rock Tom Ford and drive down the Interstate-5 to Anaheim to catch one of hip-hop’s living legends — and few natural stage presences — live, and in the flesh.

Two weekends ago, I was stranded in my bed. And with the exception of the occasional jolting cough, I couldn’t really move. Stuck there, after coming down with a nasty cold, I did something I’d never done before. I binged on TV.
Since Breaking Bad ended a few months ago, I’ve gone cold turkey with my TV watching, trying to figure out what show I should watch next. And that weekend when I was sick, I found it.
Scandal. I’m addicted to Scandal. I became so addicted, in fact, that I can tell you the difference between Olivia Pope’s home wine glasses and work wine glasses.
I used to not believe in binge watching, which sounds about as pretentious as admitting to binge watching Scandal because Breaking Bad was no longer an option. I’m here to report that binge watching does exist, and I am a victim. But I’m not the only one.
“When I get caught up with a show, it actually annoys me because I have to wait,” a colleague and fellow Scandal addict told me. “I really wanted to watch Scandal on Sunday when I got back from Thanksgiving break, but I realized they didn’t have an episode because it was Thanksgiving. And I got mad.”
Coincidentally, this happened to me, too. But when Scandal comes back on tonight (and yes, I’ve cleared my calendar), I’ll be thankful for one thing: no more uninvited, intrusive pointers.
On the website I use to watch Scandal, these so-called pointers came in two forms. On some occasions, these messages came as a transparent box on the side of the screen with questions, such as “OMG, can you believe what Mellie just said to Fitz … in front of Olivia!?!” or “Will Cyrus be mad that James … la di da?”
The other messages came in the form of user tweets, presumably from the time that the show aired. They were embedded on top of the screen, usually somewhere in the negative space — you know, that part of the frame that the director or show runner presumably never cared about in the first place. The tweets went something like, “@OliviaPopeMaven101: An affair with Prez. Seeing Daddy. Olivia deserves to break out that red wine” or “@CyrusForPresident: Quinn is annoying.”
Those are obviously not direct quotes (or actual Twitter accounts). But you get the idea.
I’m sure, months ago, these questions and messages were planned with good intentions. I imagine a boardroom meeting with a group of executives sitting around and thinking about the possibilities and how much this would enhance the viewing experience. Well, it doesn’t.
These comments and questions were distracting at best. At worst, they diminished my viewing experience by, well, making it someone else’s viewing experience.
I enjoy reading commentary more than the next person. But when I watch TV — binge watch TV — I want to be sucked in to a vortex where my mind is actively thinking about what might come next and what has just passed. I want to be the person asking the question and providing the snarky commentary.
What I’m saying is that I don’t need a transparent box floating on the side of the screen to prompt me to be outraged that something outrageous has happened. I should just be outraged. And I certainly don’t need a random person’s tweet to encapsulate it for me.
There are shows where this simultaneous engagement with the audience seems appropriate. Sunday news shows, for example, that curate and display tweets providing news reaction or expanding the conversation add value to the content. Even competition shows that ask their audiences to vote or save a member seem to add value.
But providing commentary or questions to prompt my behavior for a fictional series seems to bring no value. If anything, it diminishes the product. When I watch television, I want to be the one doing the watching. Good shows make you think and I want to be the one doing the thinking. So in the spirit of AMC Theatres’ disclaimer before movies, please don’t spoil the TV show by adding your own commentary.

The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra will host the first of five “Baroque Conversations” concerts today. This is the first time the winter series will begin before the new year. USC Thornton professor and violinist Margaret Batjer helped organize the series in her capacity as concertmaster of  LACO and will also perform in it. Though Batjer said this year’s music is not holiday-themed, the nature of Baroque music lends itself well to a December performance.

“Personally I think all Baroque music reminds me of something celebratory and … very joyous and happy,” she said.
Currently in its eighth year, the Baroque Conversations series features music from the pre-classical period of the 1600s through the time of legendary composer Johann Sebastian Bach. The theme of this year’s series is Baroque variations and in her selection of pieces, Batjer said she wanted to find works that highlight the three different types of Baroque music: chiacona, passacaglia and folia.
“There’s an enormous amount of research that goes into finding the right music,” Batjer said. “The playing part is the easy part. When they asked me to design this program I kept in mind that I was the first one of the group. I wanted our audience to have the table set for the series that’s coming and so I wanted to include a lot of these variations.”
Batjer said that baroque composers are known for their prolific works. One composer featured in the concert, Scarlatti, wrote more than 550 keyboard sonatas — three of which will be performed.
Batjer said she was always jealous that Scarlatti had composed so many keyboard sonatas and so few for violin, so she decided to play a keyboard sonata on her violin.
“The Scarlatti sonatas are extremely colorful and festive and I specifically chose Scarlatti because he’s very close to my heart,” Batjer said. “Playing them on violin was always something I wanted to do and they lend themselves well to a solo instrument.”
The concert will features six performers, in addition to Batjer: bass player Nico Abondolo, cellist Armen Ksajikian, keyboardist Patricia Mabee, violinist and assistant concertmaster Tereza Stanislav and John Schneiderman playing lute and Baroque guitar. Batjer said she enjoys working with the small group and it provides a much different experience than being part of a large orchestra.
“I’m really looking forward to working with my colleagues again in the ensemble,” Batjer said. “It’s a very small group where we can all really have the time to work in detail and explore different options of how to play the different pieces.”
Batjer also appreciates that the nature of the performance itself allows performers to communicate with the audience. Zipper Concert Hall in Downtown Los Angeles, where the performance is held, seats approximately 500 patrons and the Conversations series is unique in that it features no intermission but the music is interspersed with conversations about music and performance practice. The program also features a Question & Answer session that allows the audience to converse with performers.
“I love the intimacy of it,” Batjer said. “It’s a very special hall because people feel very much a part of the music. It’s not a humongous concert hall where people feel disconnected from the performers. By mixing talking and playing it makes people more comfortable and more open to hearing music in a different way.”
Batjer, who joined the USC faculty in 2005, said that performances such as the Baroque Conversations Series have helped her become a better teacher and teaching has also improved her performance.
“I lead two different lives, one as a performer and one as a teacher,” she said. “But they are very much interwoven. I’m always learning. I learn from performances things that I can pass on to my students but I also learn from teaching. Having to explain things to students helps me solidify more my own musical and technical choices in my own playing. I think they complement each other and there’s a really natural connection between the two.”

Every  encounter with meth head mountain man Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) constitutes a near-death experience. From his death’s head grin to his ice-cold stare and Vesuvian temper, Harlan is the stuff of Ned Beatty’s post-Deliverance nightmares, a man-shaped monster with a sadistic streak a mile wide and a low animal cunning worthy of Charles Manson.

He’s also the best part of Scott Cooper’s Out of the Furnace, an overgrown genre picture galvanized by powerfully realized performances and a believably gritty depiction of a dying Rust Belt town and the poor souls doomed to inhabit it. The film, Cooper’s sophomore effort after casting Jeff Bridges as a whisky-clogged country troubadour in Crazy Heart, stars Christian Bale as Russell Baze, a steel mill welder struggling to keep his kid brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) out of trouble following the latter’s return from his fourth tour of duty in Iraq.
Haunted by the things he’s seen and done for his country, Rodney finds that he is unable to hold down a regular job, instead drifting further and further into the world of underground street fighting, numbing his mental and spiritual anguish with regular doses of physical punishment. After weeks of continually hounding his manager/loan shark Petty (Willem Dafoe) for bigger fights and better opponents, Petty grudgingly introduces the angry young man to Harlan, the mad-dog Appalachian bruiser who runs the New Jersey chapter of the fight club when he’s not tending to his own burgeoning meth empire. When Rodney fails to return home after a particularly brutal match, it falls to Russell to seek justice.
The success of Out of the Furnace hinges on the fraternal bond between Bale and Affleck’s characters, and both are tragically convincing as siblings who have seen more than their fair share of heartache and strife.
Bale’s Russell is older but only marginally wiser.  After finishing a stint in prison for a manslaughter charge that cost him both his longtime girlfriend (Zoe Saldana, underused save for one devastating scene on a bridge) and his last chance to pull his brother back from the abyss, Russell is slaving away in the same mill that gave their father cancer. Meanwhile, Affleck’s Rodney is dead behind the eyes, a walking corpse who plans to atone for his sins by living out his days as little more than a human pitbull.
For a story so unrelentingly bleak, there are also moments of startling visual beauty, most of them having to do with the on-location setting of Braddock, Pa., where even the farthest horizon is dotted with erupting smokestacks and lined with the molten glow of steel mills. It’s a harsh, unforgiving landscape, one that wouldn’t be out of place in a John Hillcoat movie, but its decaying grandeur gives the viewer a sense of admiration for the hardworking men and women who still dare to live there. In many ways, Out of the Furnace is a western, and cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi (The Grey, Silver Linings Playbook) frames every shot like he’s filming in Monument Valley, especially during the operatic final act, which sees Russell transform from blue-collar schmoe to avenging angel.
The film also benefits from a supporting cast that seems curiously overqualified, especially given that most of their roles are little more than Screenwriting 101 archetypes. Dafoe succeeds in adding a few paternal wrinkles to Petty the Fixer, while Forest Whitaker radiates noble frustration as an honest cop who admits that there are certain pockets of Appalachia that exist beyond the realm of traditional law enforcement. Perennial bad-ss Sam Shepherd meanwhile legitimizes every scene he appears in as Russell and Rodney’s pistol-packing Uncle Red-— even if the character hews a bit too close to the riverfront hermit he played in last spring’s far-superior Mud.
It’s Harrelson, however, whose presence haunts every frame of Out of the Furnace. Sure, deranged hillbilly characters are a dime a dozen, but Harlan DeGroat is an exceptionally nasty piece of work, a frothing-at-the-mouth lunatic who seems to have the devil’s luck for never getting caught.
The scene in which he attempts to act human in front of Affleck and Dafoe is almost more chilling than the casualness of his later bloodletting. This is unquestionably the actor’s finest work since Oliver Stone’s Natural Born Killers: a potent, terrifying reminder of his range as a performer, especially for viewers who only know him as the lovable drunk Haymitch Abernathy in The Hunger Games. Long after the rest of Cooper’s film has receded from your memory, Harlan DeGroat will still be there. And he’ll be smiling that death’s head grin of his.

Graduate student loan interests cannot be increased
 
On Wednesday,  Dec. 4, graduate and professional students at USC joined graduate and professional students from schools around the nation to host a “Call Congress” day in conjunction with the GradsHaveDebt2 campaign. Graduate Student Government hosted the Call Congress Day on campus as a member of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students. Undergraduate students considering pursuing graduate degrees also participated, as they will be affected by legislative decisions in the future.
The purpose of the campaign, created by NAGPS and its members, is to educate legislators and the public about postgraduate student debt and interest rate inequality, and to give voice to graduate and professional students in the student loan conversation.
Students at USC called a number of California representatives, including Senator Barbara Boxer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Representative Karen Bass for the UPC campus, Representative Xavier Becerra for the HSC campus and California representatives in the House Education and the Workforce Committee. Students have been in contact with representatives on a number of student issues and visited the offices of many of these representatives in Washington, D.C. in September during Legislative Action Days with other graduate students. GSG will be sending another group of students in March to Washington, D.C. to raise awareness on graduate student issues such as student debt.
Student debt in the United States has been an ever-increasing problem in recent years, and is now estimated to exceed all U.S. credit card debt. Massive student debt hurts all Americans, as it prevents students and their families from being active participants in the economy by limiting their ability to invest in major purchases such as buying homes and cars, starting small businesses and starting families. Simultaneously, it creates individual challenges for students and their families who struggle to find the financial support necessary to attain a higher education degree.
Current debt levels for graduate and professional students are staggering. The average master’s student in the United States accumulates $52,000 of debt while pursuing his or her degree; the average doctoral student, $72,000 of debt and the average professional student, $113,000 of debt. Graduate and professional students have higher debt burdens, on average, than undergraduates since they often carry debt from their undergraduate studies into their graduate studies. They are also typically older than undergraduate students and no longer have parental support; instead, they may have families of their own to support.
Despite these challenges, graduate and professional student debt has been paid little attention in the conversation about national student loan debt, and recent political efforts continue to strip away loan options for graduate and professional students, which increases their debt levels. For example, in July 2012, graduate and professional students lost their eligibility to obtain subsidized Stafford Loans. Losing the subsidy means graduate and professional students now accrue interest on their loans while pursuing their degrees, which adds $18 billion to postgraduate student debt over the next 10 years. More recently, this summer’s student loan legislation increased the interest rate cap from 6.8 percent to up to 10.5 percent for graduate student loans.
In short, graduate education continues to be more expensive at a time when we need more advanced degrees than ever. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that jobs requiring graduate degrees will grow nearly 20 percent in the next five years. These jobs will be crucial for reinvigorating the economy and continuing U.S. growth; yet, the federal government continues to send signals to U.S. students that graduate school and debt is not important enough for their investment. This week students, at USC tried to change this trajectory by speaking up about the benefits of graduate education and the need that graduate and professional students face. Graduate education will continue to help our nation achieve its highest potential, and we ask that Congress take action to reduce graduate student debt to ensure this is possible.

There are 55 billionaires on the continent of Africa. Madonna is 55 years old. Between 1974 and 1986, the National Maximum Speed Law set the national speed limit at 55 miles per hour. And, as of Tuesday, the U.S. Congress had passed 55 bills in its first legislative session of 2013. That is nine more than the number of times the House of Representatives has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
As the clock ticks down on the first legislative session of the 113th Congress, they are on track to become the most unproductive Congress in U.S. history — no other Congress has passed fewer public laws in a legislative session. But that’s not the problem. What is most concerning about the last 11 months of legislating is the dangerous style in which our nation has been governed. Next Tuesday, a 25-year-old prohibition on plastic firearms that don’t show up in metal detectors and X-ray machines is set to expire. Predictably, Congress is not set to renew the ban until the day before it expires. Such a style of  flying blind is emblematic of the trend of legislating at the 11th hour that has become the new norm in Washington.
With mere days left on the legislative calendar, Speaker of the House John Boehner proudly tweeted Monday about the scheduling of four more Congressional hearings on the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act website. The “hearings,” where the only allowed testimonies are those in line with the anti-Obamacare narrative, are a waste of time and money.
Voters stood by as the GOP convened “hearings” on the Internal Revenue Service and Benghazi affairs, but this time is different. This set of hearings threatens the well-being of millions, and both houses of Congress will only be in session together for five days to deal with more pressing issues than Obamacare.
Dec. 13 was agreed upon as the deadline to reach a budget agreement ahead of the new government shutdown date, Jan. 15. Failure to reach a deadline by then will give Congress eight days from its return on Jan. 7 to avert another government shutdown. Beyond the absurdity that has become scheduling shutdown dates on the U.S. calendar every few months, another government blackout would be embarrassing at best and cataclysmic in the at worst.
Fixing the budget doesn’t come close to getting Congress off the hook. The National Defense Authorization Act, which proscribes payment and policy for the armed forces, and the farm bill, which subsidizes and controls the massive U.S. agriculture industry, both need to be checked off before the new year. Failure to act on the farm bill would cause sharp rises in food prices, and bundled in the negotiations are cuts to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program — more commonly known as food stamps. The proposed Senate version cuts $4 billion in 10 years, and needs to be reconciled with the House version, which cuts $40 billion in 10 years. It’s Congress’ way of wishing America’s poor a happy holiday.
Imagine for a moment if Congress lived their daily lives like they legislated. Would Nancy Pelosi buy groceries one day at a time, instead of buying enough to last a month? Would she blame crazy Uncle Bob for all of the family’s problems, simply because Bob always disagrees with her? Would Boehner refuse to pay the mortgage on his house unless his family canceled the vacation they had already purchased? Would Ted Cruz and Rand Paul stand on their beds and start reading the phonebook every time they fought with their wives?
The 113th Congress is already going to be remembered as one of the worst in history. Their days and approval ratings as lawmakers in 2013 are down to the single digits, and what they do with these final days could very well save a bit of face. They have just returned from the Thanksgiving holiday, where every Republican lawmaker was thankful for the catastrophic rollout of the Affordable Care Act, and every Democratic lawmaker was thankful that the Republicans shut down the government to prevent that rollout from ever happening.
The day after Thanksgiving, U.S. citizens of all political backgrounds unite in a common struggle through the doors of stores around the country to buy things they don’t need after giving thanks for all they have. In this legislative period following Thanksgiving, every item on Congress’ Black Friday shopping list is a necessity. They should be thankful for the political points they’ve scored in the last few months, and check them off like an angry mob seeking $50 televisions.
Why? A storm is coming. The sooner the Democratic Party realizes that filibuster reform and pointing fingers at the Tea Party are not ways to make government more productive, the better. The sooner the Republican Party realizes that small government does not mean a government that passes fewer laws, the better. The dark clouds of the 2014 midterm elections are on the horizon, and they will be harsh on those legislators in both parties who have put their foot in the way of progress. It would be a nice Christmas present to see them realize that before they get kicked out.
