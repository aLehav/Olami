Waving signs that read “Tripalink & USC Shame on You” and chanting “no more displacement,” activists, local residents and USC students gathered outside Tripalink student housing offices near USC’s campus on June 3, protesting rising rental costs, unfair construction practices and new housing that is rapidly changing the landscape of the area and leading to the displacement of longtime South Central Los Angeles residents.
The protest highlighted enduring issues for the neighborhood surrounding the University: rising rents, gentrification and the disparity between a largely white, wealthy student body and a predominately person of color, working-class surrounding community.
Tripalink, a housing company based in L.A. that markets specifically to college students and young professionals, has expanded rapidly across both L.A. and the United States since it was founded in 2016, targeting areas where universities can expand into surrounding communities. 
“[Protesters] just want to start exposing what [Tripalink is] doing to our community,” said Sergio Vargas, an organizer for ACCE, a housing advocacy organization. “[Protesters] were there giving testimonies of what they’re going through at this moment and what this company is inflicting upon them, basically talking about the displacement that it creates. Long term homeowners, they’re displacing these folks. The neighborhood is changing very rapidly for the community, so they want to put a stop to it.”
Housing near USC costs around $1,000 per bed, even in shared rooms, and can cost over $1,500. According to RENTcafé, a housing rental website, the average rental cost in University Park is $4,146, the most expensive in all of L.A.. Historic South Central, which encompasses parts of the neighborhood around USC, has the second highest average rental cost of $4,094.
Vargas said that while he is supportive of building more housing, Tripalink’s apartments are too expensive for many of the longtime residents. If Tripalink housing were more affordable, he would want them to build more buildings so that  “our folks can live in [them], and they can pay those rents.”
“The prices of these apartments are just way above what people can afford,” Vargas said. “If they’re going to build, we want it to be 50% affordable housing so the folks in the community can live in there too.”
The problem, Vargas said,  is not limited to South Central, and Tripalink’s model of investing into low income communities with universities could spread. 
“If a company like Tripalink is successful at creating this model, there will be way more other companies like them trying to come into any other surrounding low income area where there’s a university,” Vargas said.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the Tripalink Marketing and PR Manager said the company is committed to providing economical housing and is “proactively communicating with community stakeholders to address these issues.” The representative also said Tripalink has taken action to reduce the impact of construction on the neighborhood.
While the specific conditions of the protest were directed toward Tripalink, Vargas said USC is aware of the situation, as representatives from USC have attended ACCE organizing meetings. 
For Vargas, USC has contributed to what he views as a growing problem.
“USC is not doing enough for their students in their own campus, so what we see is [the University] giving these companies the idea for them to go out and gentrify, and then pretty much displace folks, so they can house more students in the surrounding area,” Vargas said. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University said, “The [University] has no affiliation with Tripalink. We will continue to work with our partners in the city of Los Angeles and in our community through a City Council task force that includes Neighborhood Councils and community leaders. This public process is designed to help maintain the neighborhood’s integrity.”
Kelli Lloyd, a resident of City Council District 8 and a member of ACCE  — the district in which USC is located — was at the protest because she said residents are being harassed into selling their homes and enduring unfair construction within the community.  Lloyd lives in the Crenshaw District, about three miles from USC. Though she said she has not been directly affected by Tripalink, there have been similar housing trends close to where she lives — that have also been affected by USC’s spread into the surrounding community — where residents are being evicted to get them out of rent controlled apartments. 
“Rents are sky high. The community has changed. While it’s more diverse, the people  that are coming in don’t favor the diversity that’s here,” Lloyd said. “So it’s pretty rough to be in a community where you’re comfortable, and the people who are coming in don’t have the same sense of community.”
Isa Johnson, a rising sophomore majoring in journalism, joined the protest after hearing a commotion from her room through an open window. Running out of her apartment in her red pajamas with her keys in hand, Johnson said she immediately felt connected to the protesters after seeing that many of their signs were in Spanish.
“I thought it was just ironic that I’ve been studying all these ways that there’s all of these race gaps and wealth gaps and racial disparities, and I’ve been learning about this from this institution that is doing those things,” Johnson said.

Jasmin Sanchez remembers the undergraduate students with the USC Young Scientists Program who would visit her elementary school classroom to teach her and her classmates various subjects, including math, English and science. 
“Growing up, it was like, ‘I want to be this person,’” Sanchez said. “I remember thinking, ‘That’s exactly what I want to do when I grow up.’” 
Now a rising senior majoring in health and human sciences, Sanchez has been a teaching assistant through YSP since her first semester of freshman year. Through the program, hosted by the Joint Educational Project, USC students work with seven local elementary schools, including Foshay Learning Center and Weemes Elementary School, as teaching assistants presenting hands-on labs to fourth and fifth grade students. 
Before the coronavirus pandemic, the undergraduate teaching assistants visited the schools to conduct the weekly science labs. However, because of the pandemic, the program reevaluated its function and transformed its work — instead of weekly labs, the program provided virtual lesson plans, informational YouTube videos in English and Spanish and supplies to aid teachers and students.
While USC students were no longer able to visit the schools in person, they still wanted to be able continue impacting students in the community who were lacking educational resources and time with science material.
One particular student had a very lasting impact on Sanchez. Upon her initial visit, he told her “I hate science, I hate that you’re here. And I don’t want to see you.” Once she understood his struggle stemmed from writing and that he could better reflect his work with drawing, his love for science grew exponentially. 
“He started really, really liking science, and at the end, he said, ‘I want to be a veterinarian. I know I said I hated science, but maybe I don’t hate it,’” Sanchez said. “It was just that little thing, which was just changing from writing to drawing out your findings.” 
The beginning of YSP was shaped by the feedback the program received from the schools they worked with. According to Dieuwertje Kast, a teaching assistant for YSP since 2009, principals wanted support for their teachers and students in science, especially at the elementary school level. With teacher preparation programs heavily focusing on math and reading, which are tested at the elementary school level, many elementary school teachers are not trained in teaching science. Kast said when some students begin fourth and fifth grade, when much of new science content is presented, the students become overwhelmed and don’t perform well. 
The program also prioritizes assisting marginalized communities in the local area. Angelina Crittenden, a rising senior majoring in human biology and YSP site coordinator, sees the value the program has for minority communities, providing new tools and skills to help all students become better problem solvers.
“YSP is important to me as a [Black and Indigenous woman and woman of color]because it shows students that science is not reserved for a certain demographic. They learn that they can be scientists, think like scientists and enjoy science,” Crittenden said.
Growing up in the Los Angeles community herself, Crittenden commuted to a school district in a fairly affluent neighborhood where the students were always told that they had potential and that they should shoot for the stars. That positive reinforcement significantly benefited her own academic journey and self esteem, which is exactly what she wants to create for her YSP students. 
“One of the greatest things about YSP is how students grow as more inquisitive thinkers and begin to see themselves as scientists,” Crittenden said. “Diverse representation in STEM is hard to find in the mainstream, so we make it our mission to help students realize that they are capable of anything.” 
The program is committed to its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Every year, the program does a “draw a scientist” test, where students draw what they believe to be a scientist, as a measure of the program’s growth, with what they draw implying how they see themselves in relation to the world of science.
“When we started, the scientists the students drew were predominantly white men like Albert Einstein or Rick and Morty,” Kast said. “More recently, we’ve seen a change over time of drawing more female scientists and drawing more scientists of color, and then in the last few years, we’ve also seen them starting to draw themselves as scientists, which I think is definitely one of the end goals.” 
The upcoming return to in-person learning for the local elementary schools, combined with a lack of vaccinations in young children, will cause a new set of challenges for the program. The structure will likely be a hybrid combination which will include in-person labs at the schools, with the undergraduate teaching assistants virtually leading and teaching through Zoom. However, as rules continue to change and there is still uncertainty about the new year and the development of the pandemic, YSP will continue changing their structure to best meet the guidelines and their students’ needs.
 “It was a major challenge to try and go completely online, so it’ll be a fun hybrid model for the fall,” Kast said. “That’ll be our next challenge, to see how that goes.”

When USC Pacific Asia Museum curator Rebecca Hall began planning the “We Are Here: Contemporary Art and Asian Voices in Los Angeles” exhibition in 2019, she never expected the show to close within one week of its March 2020 opening. The show finally got its long overdue time in the limelight when the exhibition reopened for one week beginning May 29. However, showcasing the voices of Asian American female artists took on a completely new meaning a year later.
After falling in love with a book about traditional Thai textiles, Hall began studying and teaching Southeast Asian art history, which culminated in her position as a museum curator at the USC Pacific Asia Museum. During her past three years at the Pacific Asia Museum, Hall noticed a disconnect between how Asian Americans felt and how they were being represented in museums.
“I’ve always felt like there’s always a disconnect between lived experiences and museums, but I also was hearing from people that they felt like the Pacific Asia Museum doesn’t represent their communities and [that] they don’t feel connections to what they were seeing,” Hall said. “I think [it’s] because, when museums and collectors collect Asian art, [we] have this ideal perspective on what Asia is … and it doesn’t necessarily reflect the larger truth of the history.”
With this disconnect in mind, Hall sought out seven Asian American female artists in Los Angeles to create an exhibition that extends viewers’ understanding of the expansive and complicated Asia Pacific heritage. One artist featured in Hall’s exhibition is Mei Xian Qiu, an ethnic Chinese minority individual who was born in Java, Indonesia and immigrated to the United States as a result of the Communist genocide. With a Chinese name, an Indonesian name and a Catholic name, Qiu takes inspiration from the restless, diasporic experience of Asian Americans. At the exhibition, Qiu displayed “Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom,” a collection of pieces that portrayed the interaction between Western archetypes on what the Chinese identity looked like and self-constructed perception of what the Chinese identity was, as someone who didn’t quite understand Chinese culture despite being ethnically Chinese herself. The pieces have a common theme of depicting Pan-Asian models dressed in stereotypical Chinese clothing from the Mao era, against American landmarks such as the White House and the Grand Canyon, or Western themes such as The Temptation of Eve.
“When you are a person from a certain diaspora … as opposed to someone who is in China from China, your identity is much more clear,” Qiu said. “But when you identify yourself as American or Indonesian or Chinese-American-Indonesian, there is a kind of a disconnect between … how people perceive China — China as a country and who we are as Americans.”
“Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom” featured photographs of a dystopian fictional mafia invasion carried out by Chinese and Pan-Asian American actors, but purposely used tropes that Westerners would perceive as stereotypically Chinese. Qiu said she conducted a lot of research prior to this project because the subject was so complicated, as well as “acutely painful and acutely shared.” 
“I’m really interested in this idea of creating identities and also [in], not only the type of propaganda that is put forth in order to make people believe in something, but [also] the type of stories that we create to make sense of our own lives in a way we have to,” Qiu said. “I think a lot of people have to create a reality that makes sense to them these days, and that often has elements of fiction and nonfiction in it.”
To Qiu, there’s always an element of the artist’s humanity that goes into each work, and even though what viewers take away may not always be what the artist intends, Qiu’s goal is for her art to ask questions the viewer can answer. 
“I’ve done a lot of work that dealt with what Chinese meant coming from a culture where we were identified as Chinese but [were] never really part of the main Chinese culture,” Qiu said. 
As her time went on as an artist, Qiu thought about shifting her gaze to the Indonesian experience because it is a story that is underrepresented for Western viewers. 
Sharing the exhibition room with Qiu is Sichong Xie, an interdisciplinary artist whose art addresses Chinese identity, politics and cross-culturalism. Xie displayed a multimedia video and scaffolding installation titled “Do Donkeys Know Politics?” that tells the story of her grandfather, who was sent to a labor camp in China for drawing a political cartoon in the 1950s. Xie’s multimedia video consisted of five clips that show the multiple iterations of cartoon drafts as she received critique from her grandmother while trying to redraw the cartoon based on her grandmother’s memories. 
The scaffolding installation is representative of her grandfather’s career as an architect and shows the temporary, “invisible labor” of construction workers that is lost once the architecture is completed. During the pandemic, Xie began working on her second scaffolding project that features bamboo scaffolding that is popular in her hometown of Xi’an, China, as well as embroidery of the floor plans her grandfather designed for residential homes in the 1950s that were never built. Through embroidery, which is labor intensive yet meditating, Xie said she hopes to make the “invisible labor” more visible to viewers. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Xie was unable to visit her family in Xi’an, but the distance motivated her to delve deeper into her grandfather’s history and channel her anxieties into art.  
Following the abrupt closing of the show in March, the USC Pacific Asia Museum was quick to transition the exhibit into a virtual format. Because Xie’s art is three-dimensional and performative, transitioning her projects to be consumed virtually caused a lot of its depth to be lost.
“I feel like it’s a totally different experience seeing performance in person rather than seeing the documentation of it,” Xie said. ”You don’t have a scale in mind if you view the sculpture from the computer screen.”
Qiu also believes that viewing art virtually makes it difficult to fully engage in it. 
“A lot of my pieces have texture … and have been changed through non-mechanical means … where you have to see it because there’s a dimensionality to it. I think it’s easy to gloss over work when you see it virtually, but it’s easier to engage in work when you see it in person,” Qiu said. “Maybe it’s not so confrontational, but it forces engagement, when you’re there [in that environment] … I went there in person after not seeing it for a long time, and it had a big effect on me.”
Xie said that even though “Do Donkeys Know Politics?” was completed in February 2020, since she hadn’t seen the installation in a year, it felt old and new at the same time when the show reopened a few weeks ago. For Hall and all the artists who participated, seeing the exhibition with the lens of people who recently experienced an upsurge in Asian American hate was very emotional.
“I worked on the exhibition for a year before it opened, and then during COVID, while we were closed, our entire understanding — and I mean larger — American understanding of AAPI experiences [changed]. All of a sudden, the exhibition took on new meaning,” Hall said. “Selfishly, I really want everybody to love the diversity of our Asian communities as much as I do and to understand them.”
Creating a better understanding of the Pan-Asian experience may be popular in the media now because of Asian American hate, but it has always been crucial to narrowing the disconnect that Asian diasporic individuals feel in American society. Hall had been working on the exhibition for over a year before its unexpected closing, and said that it was “nice to have something that helped expand our perspectives on the subject” since there was “no way we could have ever known what was going to happen.”
“I almost cried when I heard about the show, and I was really honored to be part of it because I just feel like this was a voice that we need to have, much like Asian American male voice. In Los Angeles, has there been a show like that before? I just felt that it was so important,” Qiu said. 
Xie also said that many experiences are shared across different Pan-Asian heritages, which is why Hall’s position as a curator that covers such a broad geographical area allows for her to create community instead of delving into the nuances of one particular region.
“It’s really interesting because every artist in this show — their story is so honest. And it’s a family, personal experience,” Xie said. “All those issues and concerns they brought up in their work [are] important to pay attention to, especially if you don’t really know different stories from the Asian community in Los Angeles.”
The disconnect between Pan-Asian experiences and Pan-Asian representation in museums, media and daily life made it necessary for Hall to use her position as a museum curator to deepen viewers’ understanding, especially during this period of heightened racial tension.
“I think what also drove me crazy was that anytime you would see something in print about L.A.’s Asian communities, it was often about food … I mean, who doesn’t love that? But on the other hand, there’s so much more complexity to these communities,” Hall said. “I just wanted that to come across. If somebody comes through the exhibition with no knowledge and they have an appreciation for the individuality of the artists … and understanding of the AAPI experience in a little bit more in depth, I would be very happy about that.”
Though the in-person show of  the exhibition has already closed, the virtual exhibition can still be accessed on the Pacific Asia Museum’s website, and the museum continues to do its part in educating viewers about the Pan-Asian experience.

Prepare for the return of the hourlong Snapchat stories — live music is returning to Los Angeles. The ever-chic concert culture of the city is preparing for a sexy comeback. 
Needless to say, the bands are back together, and crowds are rewarding them with enthusiasm. 
Getting the Band Back Together 
Long Beach alt-pop band, Boy Called Cute, is returning to their adoring fans. Composed of lead singer 22-year-old Tommy Olaes, Max Leibl and siblings Ed, Bella and Lewis Marshall, the band was stretched thin by the pandemic, both musically and emotionally. 
The group has played together since 2018, but when the coronavirus pandemic struck, a certain sense of burnout hung heavy. 
“When [the pandemic] started, we were all away from each other,” Olaes said. “Then we were kind of like, ‘Well, I don’t know how we’re supposed to continue making music.’ None of us had any drive to make music.”
The band took a break, some  members releasing music individually and pursuing other creative endeavors.However, as public spaces opened up, the band has reconnected to make new music and start performing live shows again. 
At their most recent show at 4th Street Vine, a bar in Long Beach, Olaes realized it was many people’s first time seeing live music since the pandemic. 
“I was super scared … because we hadn’t performed in so long, but everybody was super happy … and everybody was dancing,” Olaes said. “I’m excited to play more shows because I think people are more appreciative.” 
Jada Young, a longtime friend of Olaes and fan of Boy Called Cute, attended one of these newly reopened shows. It was her first time seeing live music since the beginning of the pandemic. 
“[It was] unexpectedly nostalgic,” Young said. “In part, it was exciting because it felt like we’re stepping into a new chapter and moving past everything that happened this year, but at the moment … it reminded me of the first concert that I ever went to. Almost like a whole new fresh experience.”

Young and Olaes have known each other since elementary school and watching each other grow has always been meaningful to them, but Young noted watching Boy Called Cute evolve is especially significant.
“I feel like because I’m close to them … it’s been interesting to see the shift in watching them kind of just do it for fun and getting to see people who I know really well perform and have an outlet to do something they’re passionate about,” Young said. 
As time has gone on, Boy Called Cute’s audience has expanded, along with their artistic creativity. With a newfound spark of inspiration, Olaes and the other members of the band are looking forward to more live performances. 
Young said there is something unique about watching the band perform. 
“Tommy [will] cater to the crowd, he likes to connect with them and the other people on stage,” Young said. “But compared to Bella or Lewis, you could just watch them, like, in their eyes, they’re just so in their craft and it’s awesome to see each individual character and how they contrast but come together to be in one band.” 
With the members all bringing a flair and passion to their performance, it’s no wonder Boy Called Cute is taking Long Beach and L.A. County by storm. 
The Power of Performance
For a notably exceptional music community like USC’s, the loss of live music was an especially difficult feat for students and artists alike. So, when the music scene picked back up, local USC musicians heard the call. They flocked to Koreatown to perform in a show hosted by 29th St. Productions.
Among the audience members was Christine Stavish. A civil engineering major at USC and fan of live music, Stavish tries to see three to four live performances each semester but will normally attend any show she can.
“[The best part about live music is] the atmosphere that the audience and musicians create together,” Stavish said.
The show in K-Town brought together USC musicians Guspy, Kid Hastings and Ella Collier. The opportunities to see these talented young artists, especially within the school community, is a significant and impactful aspect of the USC student experience, Stavish said.
“It’s especially cool to see classmates and peers performing … in an intimate setting as well. It really amplifies that feeling of connection through the music they’re playing,” Stavish said. 
Seeing USC musicians perform created a marked moment for Stavish’s first concert since the pandemic.
“It was almost like a rebirth of what we all miss so much from pre-pandemic,” Stavish said. “It was really special to have everyone having a good time and just so grateful to be back in a setting like that, so it was really special.”
Much like many in-person events, attending concerts and connecting with strangers, friends and lovers was something the pandemic did not permit. And, whether or not you’re a regular concertgoer, the environment of live music performances is an unequivocally special opportunity to bond with culture and community.
Most will agree: music simply makes the world a better place, and the opportunity to see music live is a treasure. 
“I think that music in general has definitely always been a universal language for everyone. I feel like the fact that people now get to experience live music with not only their friends but with complete strangers means we’re going back into a world of connection,” Young said. “ It’s like we’re coming back together and moving forward to a new hope and possibilities for human connection.”

Growing up, everyone becomes a fan of something. Whether it’s an artist or a band or an athlete, the bubbly energy of watching them often results in passion. That passion evolves into an obsession, and obsession into a determination to know every single thing about the certain passion. 
At the age of 14, Aron Cohen’s passion transformed into a lifestyle. A die-hard Los Angeles Laker fan, he started a fan page on Instagram with no social media experience. 
Nearly 300,000 followers later, Cohen has built a brand around his fan page “LakersAllDayEveryday” that any Laker fan can connect to. A 2021 graduate, he credited the Trojan family for his immense growth as it offered him more opportunities to land jobs in his career field.
Being a fan of the Lakers is common for kids growing up in L.A.. But Cohen desired to express his love for the team to the world. The Lakers’ global fanbase made it easier for him to grow his page into a powerhouse. 
As one of the biggest entities in the world, the Lakers are recognizable across time zones and bodies of water. Fans dedicate themselves to never missing a game and building rooms full of Laker gear. 
On the contrary, some are annoyed by their winning history or of their Hollywood culture. For Cohen, it’s the embodiment of success — he adores the Lakers more than the average human and wanted to share that passion.
“I [had] seen some other fan pages and stuff like that, not that many, but there were a few. And I was like, ‘I’m down to make my own,’” Cohen said. “It was not a sit-down thing where I was like, ‘OK, I’m gonna make this page. I’m gonna have it for a long time then turn to career.’”
Whether it’s receiving a signed game-worn jersey from forward Anthony Davis or playing NBA 2K with former guard Quinn Cook or being gifted signed game-worn shoes from forward Montrezl Harrell, Cohen’s interactions with Laker players has been the stuff of legends. 
The name is no joke either. He posts content every single day. From highlights while a game is going on to previews of matchups to extensive free agency coverage, Cohen covers it all. 
But, it took time. 
“The obstacle was that it was such a new platform”
Back in 2013, the world of Instagram was as grim as the Lakers’ future. After launching in 2010, the app was a mere afterthought among the juggernauts of social media. Users were fairly limited and Cohen said social influencers were nonexistent.
Cohen said it was a challenge growing a following with very limited resources available on Instagram. Just like other professional franchises, Cohen found a way to get his page out and resorted to a strategy many teens on Instagram did back then — asking other pages to follow him in return for a follow back. 
“That was literally the only strategy there was at the time. Because now you can pay for ads, promos through Instagram, influencers can pay, but at the time, there [was] literally nothing. So that’s what I was doing,” he said. “The challenge was very new. It’s just you got to spend a ton of time building from the ground up.”
Building from the ground up is exactly what Cohen did. Unfortunately, for him, it was during the worst era of Lakers basketball. 
When he launched his page in August 2013, the Lakers were in an odd place. The future of the storied franchise was in shambles with lots of questions about the future of the team. 
The Lakers had just been swept in the first round of the NBA playoffs against the San Antonio Spurs. It was evident the tide was turning. Most importantly, franchise star Kobe Bryant was attempting to come back from one of the worst injuries in sports: a torn Achilles tendon. And Bryant wasn’t getting any younger. 
Cohen began doing something many Laker fans genuinely struggled to do: be positive. His content was less of ranting about the team and poor performances, and more about the bright side.
It’s a testament to who he is as a person. According to Cohen, he’s generally very positive.
“There’s a reason why I’m being optimistic because it’s not because I’m just saying it to say [it]. You got to be real with the followers,” Cohen said. “And that’s why I feel people come to know me as the positive person, the positive Laker fan. That’s the thing I kind of try to spread regardless of Lakers.”
From a couple hundred to 281,000 
In a platform overwhelmed with negativity, his positive energy made his content stand out like a sore thumb.
Even with the consistent positive outlook, no one could have predicted what would happen next for the Lakers — there would be no playoff appearances from 2013 to 2020 — just like how Cohen couldn’t predict the way his page would soon erupt. 
The follow-for-follow strategy continued for a couple of years until new promotion methods were created. 
A new strategy called shoutout for shoutout became common practice for Cohen. He would tell his followers to follow a page with similar interests with the other page doing the same to their followers. It led to an influx of followers for Cohen with even some former Laker players, like Cook, Lamar Odom and assistant coach Phil Handy, supporting his page.
Creating a following for the page though was as simple as being consistent with his content. The more Cohen posted, the more his interaction and following increased, even during a time where the Lakers were one of the worst teams in the league, winning less than 30 games each season from 2013 to 2017. 
“I feel like the reason why this page was successful through those years [is] because I was doing it for one reason only, it was literally just because it was a hobby. And it was something that I got joy out of and also people got joy from,” Cohen said. “It wasn’t because of money. It wasn’t because I wanted status. It wasn’t because of anything, [it] was literally just because I love the Lakers.”
His love for the Lakers is as clear as the L.A. sky in June. It’s what helps him stay relevant among countless fan pages that rise from the world of Instagram each season.
Cohen also said he wanted to make the page more of a community full of discussion rather than a news page.
“I’ve made my page a platform for people to discuss — the comments are always crazy,” he said. “There’s a lot of good discussions that go live all the time and get people really a platform to voice their own opinions, because everyone also wants to have a voice, people want to consume, and feel as that they’re part of something, but also they want to contribute.”
His dedication to creating an open community for Laker fans has paid off. More often than not, fan pages dissolve as quickly as they began. Cohen’s page is an exception. 
“People always ask me for advice on how to be successful on social media and build a following that cares about what you have to say, and post, it starts with being consistent,” he said. “You got to study the bigger accounts and the successful pages of what they’re doing and apply all that you find to your own page. But you got to be consistent.”
“[The goal is that] I don’t need to depend on any other sources of income aside from LakersAllDayEveryDay” 
The page started as a hobby, but Cohen quickly realized it could be a career by putting in immense time commitment.
“This is easily, easily a full time job if you take it seriously the way I do,” Cohen said. “Now that I graduated school, I don’t know how I was able to do it, just balancing my job, school and the Laker page because this thing is such a big time commitment.”
What makes Cohen’s story bizarre though is the lack of training in social media he had when he started the page. His first professional experience with social media came three years after the launch of the page. Because of his page’s success, Adidas hired him to complete a winter project to test the Instagram market. 
Once he finished with Adidas, Cohen saw opportunities come in a flurry, with USC playing a massive role.
A startup sports company called Q4 Sports hired him to run their social media account for two years which he said was a huge learning experience. After Q4, Cohen transferred to USC from Santa Monica College and took over the men’s basketball Instagram account. The experience led to him becoming a student ambassador for Bleacher Report and assisting famed basketball trainer Chris Matthews, also known as “Lethal Shooter,” with his Instagram content. 
The most influential experience, Cohen said, was when he was hired as a social media intern with ESPN the summer before his senior year. 
Cohen was in charge of contributing to the various ESPN Instagram accounts such as NBA and NFL on ESPN. ESPN Senior social media specialist Dean Berhow-Goll managed him during his internship, recalling Cohen’s passion and energy and as “one of the best interns we’ve ever had.”
“He was eager to create; he had the experience with starting LakersAllDayEveryDay,” Berhow-Goll said. “And, really, he was just a fun person to work with everyday, just because he was so excited to be there. And he was so just full of energy.”
Cohen said his four months at ESPN were memorable. He was able to curate multiple Instagram posts that raked almost half a million likes. 
The position came to life from persistence and eagerness to become part of the team. He fell into contact with an important person too — ESPN’s Senior Vice President, Ilan Ben-Hanan, whom he met through Annenberg Professor Jeff Fellenzer’s class.
Ben-Hanan, a USC alum himself, is a frequent speaker at Fellenzer’s class and notices when students are more enthusiastic than others. 
Cohen was one of them.
“I was just very, very impressed [with Cohen’s page]. Obviously, a tireless work ethic, so enthusiastic, so authentic. And that stuff really shines through when you talk to him,” Ben-Hanan said. “He just has a knack for relationship building and being in the right place at the right time, which doesn’t happen by accident. That’s preparation.”
Cohen oozes with energy and enthusiasm unlike many. From the moment you meet him, it’s clear he has the most effulgent love for the Lakers.
When he celebrated their championship last year by popping champagne and yelling profusely in his backyard, Cohen went viral, with players and media finding his page. The passion pops out of his account, and it’s what makes him different from other fan accounts. 
As a recent graduate, Cohen’s dream is to turn LakersAllDayEveryday into a career. With how passionate Cohen is, it’s only a matter of time until it comes true.
“My main goal is to turn this into a full-time thing where my every day is I wake up like, ‘OK, what are we doing for LakersAllDayEveryDay?’” he said. “It’s not really working for anyone else. That’s the goal to make it simple.”

Last October, in quiet Brentwood, in the quieter Mandeville Canyon, on an even quieter residential street, students, dancers and production teams milled about a multi-million dollar mansion — working, eating, lounging. Everyone in this scene had a mission: to work on or support USC multi-hyphenate Yasin Benhaddou’s — known mononymously as Yasin — latest music video for his single, “Get It On.” Since its drop, the track has reached over 80,000 streams on Spotify — his most successful to date. 
While the 10,000 square foot mansion was a striking focal point for the video, what was even more fascinating was the assortment of young people behind its production. 
The director, a Trojan who goes by the name TooSam, was on hiatus from the USC School of Cinematic Arts at the time of the production. The background dancers were also primarily USC students. And beyond the USC community, there were photographers, musicians, dancers and other creatives pulled from all over Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area — the latter, Yasin’s home. 
From the sheer talent appearing from the crew on set, it seemed like Yasin had made a point to surround himself with people as dedicated to the craft as him. This includes 20-something-year-old L.A. dancers Venetia “Vee” Zipporah, Jessika “Jessy J” Jax and Raquel “Rocky” Amdal. The group met Yasin and each other through Instagram and have been collaborating on music videos ever since. 
“The chemistry is just there,” Jessy J said. “Whenever we get booked for things, we call each other.”
While the dance group has pursued their own career endeavors, they came together to collaborate for the “Get It On” video. At the center of this collaboration was Yasin, who took the responsibility of making sure that everything was flowing smoothly, all while starring in the video.
Yasin’s ambition has long been influenced by the people that surrounded him, including by friends and roommates at USC. 
“Being put in an environment where all these people my age [are] … striving towards something that usually is looked at as impossible, it just made me realize that is actually the opposite,” he said. “Seeing people have a drive to strive for something that’s not something [that] a normal person would strive for, made me [feel] like … if they can do it, I can do it too.”
Throughout filming “Get It On” — the single that was dropped on Nov. 6 — played on repeat over portable speakers. Even on set, it was evident that this track was laced with unique quality — its beat and the “let’s, let’s get it on” refrain is persistently infectious. It was predestined to take root in listeners’ brains for days or weeks. 
The track is Yasin at his best, incorporating different elements from his back catalog. It’s the type of song you blast from your car’s stereo with all the windows down — pure fun. In some ways, it’s a return to form for Yasin, whose first songs featured a loud brash persona. 
“It’s just bouncy,” said fellow USC musician Alvin Makori, a 2021 graduate with a degree in Law, History, and Culture. “It was an almost effortless kind of a vibe. Like he didn’t want to be like the most perfect … He was just being him and going with the beat.”
Yasin released two other singles in 2020, January’s “blessings + curses” and August’s “Stay Strong.” They both take on unique personalities — “blessings + curses” best resembles a thoughtful Big Sean as Yasin melodically raps over a reverberating backing beat. “Stay Strong,” the middle child of Yasin’s 2020 releases, is similarly powerful in its own right.
“Stay Strong” signifies Yasin’s immense artistic creativity. It’s highly and masterfully produced, leveraging Yasin’s whispering, auto-tune singing and rapping vocals to showcase a multi-layered ambiance. With most other artists, this effect might be overwhelming, but on “Stay Strong,” the combination works. 
Yasin’s unique background further adds to his individuality as an artist. His parents are immigrants from Morocco who settled in the Bay Area to work and raise their children — a story many immigrants and first-generation kids can identify with.
While his parents worked multiple jobs to provide for their kids, Yasin hustled to pay them back. In high school, he began writing songs and performing at Bay Area venues, opening for burgeoning artists like Adrian Marcel and Yung Pinch. Backstage, he would pass out business cards printed on CVS picture paper. The young artist knew what he needed to do to gain recognizable success in his career, and he had the savvy to do it. 
Cut to his first week at USC, where Yasin met creative friends and future collaborators like Ben10K and 24kGoldn. Yasin was inspired by his ambitious and talented peers, and he felt ready to take on the industry. One obstacle stood his way: he had been admitted into USC’s prestigious, but time consuming, computer science and business administration program. He had to make a decision. 
He went to his counselor’s office, dropping all of his computer science classes and trading them in for General Education and business courses. Yasin decided that music was going to take a front seat in his life.
That same week, Yasin met friend and future collaborator 24kGoldn. The two would go on to create a school anthem and Yasin’s biggest feature to date, “I Go to USC.” Since its release, the track has racked up over a quarter-million views on YouTube and nearly 300,000 streams on SoundCloud. 
As carelessly fun as the track sounds, there was serious thought put into its marketing. The video capitalized on USC’s Varsity Blues scandal, beginning with clips from news anchors and late-night hosts covering the scandal. The music video also dropped at the beginning of Fall 2019 with the explicit goal of attracting freshman listeners. 
Their plan worked. The two quickly became campus heroes and played gigs at multiple L.A. venues like The Nightingale. While 24kGoldn has gone on to find astronomic success with his own music, Yasin made it clear that he wants to be known for more than being “the guy on Goldn’s song.”
Listening through his discography, listeners can hear the ever-improving development in his music. His latest release, “Five 10,” featuring the recording artist LEW, follows “Get It On” chronologically, but also stylistically. The single is upbeat, complicated and catchy — a post-pandemic party anthem that marks years of creative and technical development on Yasin’s part.
Since the coronavirus pandemic forced USC to hold virtual classes, Yasin has been on leave from school. However, he’s confident that the hiatus is temporary. 
“Both my parents are from Morocco … [and] haven’t been to college,” Yasin said. “So, whatever happens I feel like I’m kind of obligated to graduate for them.” 
L.A. is full of aspiring artists, but Yasin brings something new to the table. It’s a freshness that Makori attributes to Yasin’s willingness to take risks and experiment with his sound. 
“He’s going places,” Makori said. “He’s a hard worker, and he’s persistent. So, you know, he’s gonna get to wherever he wants to [go].”
For now, the gifted young artist is honing his craft with regular studio sessions and creating a strong circle of support. 
“I feel like I’m getting better every time I go in,” Yasin said. “I feel like every time I leave the studio, I’m making something better than I did the day before … I feel like I finally found the right pocket for my voice.”

So, NASCAR is in an odd place right now. In the last year or so, the sport has increased its efforts to promote social justice initiatives. Through this year of supposed progress, NASCAR’s main selling point was its commitment to racial equity and diversity within the sport. 
The only Black driver in NASCAR’s top division, Bubba Wallace, was met with an outpour of support after a noose was found in his team’s trailer after a race last July. The uncovering of the noose prompted an FBI investigation and was a black eye on the sport after months of supposed work combatting racism. 
A month prior to the noose incident, NASCAR banned the Confederate flag and its imagery from NASCAR races and events. What spurred the sudden commitment to combating racial injustice in a notoriously conservative sport? It was likely a combination of two things. The first was likely a response to the ongoing social justice movement, as increased attention was paid to racial injustice across the United States in the summer of 2020.
Secondly, and more importantly, one of NASCAR’s top drivers Kyle Larson was caught saying a racial slur on a livestream in April 2020. So, to summarize: Larson gets caught in April; the confederate flag was banned in June and Wallace’s noose incident and the ensuing outpour of support happened in July. 
This four-month period likely spurred more progress within the sport of NASCAR than the previous two decades combined. Larson’s sponsors dropped him; his team owner released him and it looked like someone was actually paying the consequences for racist behavior in the sport of NASCAR. Boy, were we wrong. 
In October 2020, just six months after Larson’s seemingly career-ending mistake, he was reinstated to the sport. Weeks later, Larson signed with one of NASCAR’s strongest teams Hendrick Motorsports. Not only did Larson serve a half-ass punishment, but he arguably failed upwards, signing for a better team than he was with prior to the live-stream incident. 
Since Larson’s reinstatement, he’s been nothing short of dominant. To the dismay and disappointment of many fans, Larson is basically the face of the sport right now. Early in the season, when Larson was still completely unsponsored and struggling to compete, it was easy to ignore his presence. 
In the last month or so, things have changed dramatically and NASCAR is in a precarious position. Larson has won three straight points races. He also won NASCAR’s annual All-Star Race and claimed its $1 million winner’s prize. Larson leads the circuit in points, wins and laps led by a significant margin. He’s the overwhelming favorite to win the title, and sponsors have ended their hiatus from advertising with Larson. 
We all knew someone was going to take the bait at some point, as corporate America is most certainly not above taking the opportunity to buy low on advertising space on Larson’s equipment. What I didn’t expect was companies to give in his quickly (looking at you, Valvoline).
NASCAR is in a dangerous spot. One year ago, it looked like Larson’s career could be over, as if NASCAR had finally taken a step in the right direction. A year later, the worst case scenario is here. The man who used one of the most offensive words in the English language while expressing frustration in a video game stream is now the face of the sport in just over a year’s time.
So who’s in the wrong here? How did this happen? 
Well, for starters, there’s a lot of things NASCAR could have done differently. They could have kept Larson on the sideline longer or forced him to agree to a stipulation where he was required to promote social justice upon his reinstatement. Instead, Larson is enjoying what seems like a redemption tour, proving his “doubters” wrong and almost playing the role of the victimized athlete striving for vindication. 
It’s not like Larson’s contract ran out with Chip Ganassi Racing and Ganassi slighted him and chose another driver over him. Larson said something racist and had to face consequences for his words. He’s not a victim. It feels woefully dismissive for the sport of NASCAR, its broadcasting partners and its drivers to celebrate Larson as some sort of martyr who deserves his success because of overwhelming hardship. The sport of NASCAR does not have to celebrate Larson regardless of his dominance. His ability as a driver does not take away from the mistakes he’s made in the very recent past. According to NASCAR, car owner Rick Hendrick and Larson’s new sponsor Valvoline, racism isn’t a deal-breaker. So much for progress.

Playing as a dog wielding a magical paintbrush, the player embarks on an adventure to restore color to the world of Picnic Province, solving puzzles with the power of paint. Everything on the screen can be drawn on with the paintbrush, allowing the player to progress through the game while creating artistic masterpieces on top of it. “Chicory: A Colorful Tale” grants the player lots of artistic freedom and is great for those looking for some brain-bending puzzles with creative solutions.
$20 — PC, PS4.
A Short Hike
“A Short Hike” is a beautiful little 3D platformer that lets you explore around the beautiful Hawk Peak Provincial Park. What makes this game so special is its lack of required tasks or structure, which lets the player explore and discover hidden little secrets at their own pace. While the main task is to climb to Hawk Peak, the mountain in the center of the park, there’s many other fun activities to explore in the world, such as riding a motorboat and footracing to different places around the park. Accompanied by unique, low poly visuals and a calm, easygoing soundtrack, “A Short Hike” is great to pick up and return to at your leisure.
$8 — PC, Nintendo Switch.
GRIS
“GRIS” is an intimately emotional 2D game that follows a young woman named Gris, a voiceless girl who’s sent tumbling into a barren, colorless world. Without the ability to sing, it becomes her mission to regain it in order to restore the dilapidated world back to its original state. Throughout her journey, Gris experiences a slew of different emotions and self-reflects while experiencing the five stages of grief. “GRIS” focuses a lot less on its gameplay and more on the breathtaking visuals and heart-wrenching narrative. Those who are interested in a heartfelt, interactive story will fall in love with what “GRIS” has to offer.
$17 — PC, PS4, Mobile, Nintendo Switch. 
Knockout City
Another recent release from EA, “Knockout City” is an action-packed, competitive game that turns the game of dodgeball on its head. With the objective to knock out opponents with dodgeballs while moving around the game’s arena, it’s a high-octane game with both solo and team-based game modes. You can play it online with your friends as well, making it a great way to band together with friends or to climb your way up to the top of the totem pole with the game’s online ranking system. 
$20 — PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch.
OMORI
“OMORI” is another emotional and narrative-heavy RPG game that follows the story of Omori, a young boy, as he and his best friends set out on a search for their missing friend Basil. The story quickly takes a turn as the player learns that the world Omori resides in is not what it seems, as the game begins to take a nightmarish and surrealistic turn. The game’s beautifully crafted and whimsical world contrasts with its serious story that masterfully brings attention to depression, self-harm, escapism and other mental health struggles that have become major talking points in the past decade. “OMORI” is a great game for those looking for a serious, yet lighthearted story with emotional highs and lows that will leave you in tears.
$20 — PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch.

As I write this column in anticipation of the Tokyo Olympics, I feel an abnormal amount of patriotism coursing through my veins. Not to equate patriotism with an aloof attitude toward a corrupt government, but I do feel most proud to call the United States my home during the Olympics. 
Just yesterday, while I was watching the U.S. Olympic Trials, NBC momentarily cut to the Paralympic Trials happening simultaneously. I instantly noticed a discrepancy — while the Track & Field trials for athletes who are not disabled were in the magnificent University of Oregon Stadium, the athletes competing for a spot in the Paralympics were at a discreet, smaller stadium in the Minneapolis area, with no stands for spectators and mediocre publicity. 
With little time for me to contemplate, the television cut to a commercial for the Paralympics, which opened with, “Everyone’s got a screen in their hands, but not everyone’s watching us.” Following a showcase of extraordinary athletes, such as David Wagner, Katie Holloway and Sam Grewe, the commercial concluded with, “Let’s make the Paralympics impossible to miss and together we’ll show the world.” 
I found it ironic that NBC approached this commercial with a unified front after what I had just witnessed. These broadcasting networks are attempting to increase the salience of the Paralympics through a “We’re all in this together” rhetoric. I couldn’t help but think that NBC was targeting its audience and consumers to indirectly blame us for its own shortcomings in providing equal coverage and treatment of athletes who have and do not have disabilities. 
But this paradigm of blaming the consumer is far from unfamiliar. Whether we are discussing pollution, workers’ rights or other marginalized communities’ treatment in the media, the Paralympics highlight a fallacy in how we gravitate toward micro solutions to macro problems. 
To be clear, blatant ableism still goes unchecked in all aspects of society separate from the Paralympics. For instance, we have not forgotten about Artie pedaling himself into the pool during the Glee cover of “We Found Love.” Sia developed a movie, casted Maddie Ziegler, an allistic actress, to play a person with autism and told people that it was their fault for being terrible actors when they called her out. The movie then got nominated for not one but two awards at the Golden Globes. And, “vaccines cause autism” is still an accepted anti-vaccine argument. 
But ableism is not solely responsible for the discrepancy. While sports corporations drastically undermine athletes with disabilities, women have been underpaid and maltreated by the sports industry, whether it be the NCAA women basketball athletes who were given inadequate training facilities and equipment during March Madness or the age-old dilemma of the U.S. women’s soccer team who simply want equal pay for being better than the men’s team.  
After all, the goal of the sports industry is to not treat athletes equally: It’s to maximize profits. The athletes in the NBC commercial were used as pawns to guilt the consumer into feeling responsible for the low ratings of the Paralympics. Although more Americans watch the regular Olympics than the Paralympics, which can be explained by ableism, this national attitude is woven deeply into our framework, and just encouraging more people to watch the Paralympics is not enough of a solution. 
We virtually live in a plutocracy where decisions are made by the wealthiest that serve their personal interests. Yet, they evade our scrutiny and pinpoint a scapegoat — the common people, the proletariat, if you will. If people don’t watch the Paralympics, it’s their own fault, not the marketing directors’ nor the U.S. Olympic Committees’. 
If people decide not to work because of pathetic minimum wages far below that of stimulus checks, it’s their fault for being lazy and accepting “government handouts,” not the billionaires who widen the socioeconomic gap, evade taxes and plan vacations to space. If people drink out of plastic straws (which are responsible for less than 1% of ocean pollution), it’s their fault for not making wiser consumer decisions, not the corporations and commercial fishers that are responsible for a majority of ocean pollution. 
Ultimately, the Paralympics illustrate macro level issues that cannot be solved by simply spreading awareness. But I am not advocating against micro solutions. After all, they tend to be the most concrete and simple ways for an individual to act, so it’s no wonder why we gravitate toward them. But we will never be equal by working for insufficient minimum wages or simply tuning into the limited coverage of the Paralympics. At least, that doesn’t sound like patriotism nor justice to me.

Two years ago, I interviewed my favorite teacher for a short paper discussing what it meant to be prosperous for middle-aged adults who were in their early twenties or so when the digital revolution ushered itself in. She was my Latin teacher (Yeah, I took Latin. Big whoop.) and role model. She had spent all four years with me, progressing up among the faculty ranks and watching me justify forgetting to do homework due to my senioritis. In my last summer column before fall rolls around, I wanted to highlight a quick tidbit of advice she gave me about what it meant to be prosperous. 
“[Prosperity means] flourishing in whatever you’re doing. This might be your job or relationships and family,” she said. “I’m a teacher. I knew I wouldn’t be wealthy. I consider myself wealthy for the wonderful relationships I’ve had with my students and for being given a career that I love.”
Returning to the college campus after a year of staring at blank Zoom rooms, hating breakout rooms and hoping that someone hits you up on USC Missed Connections can feel overwhelming. The physical classroom and living settings are a whole different ball game. Thriving and feeling that prosperity can be a real challenge, especially for those who are stepping foot on campus for the first time in a city like Los Angeles.
Often, being at an academically rigorous institution with incredibly talented and accomplished people can also be taxing, so this last summer column goes out to the college students. We often are forced to wear masks that allow us to fit in with different groups, myself included. My attitude when talking to a group of accomplished pre-meds in a study group is the polar opposite to the side that I show my copy editors on shift — those guys are my favorites. Prosperity, in part, is being able to take off the mask and continue to be yourself while thriving in that space. Chasing validation and pursuing prosperity are both long-distance races, sure, but they more often than not run in different directions.
You are not necessarily always going to succeed in every space you are in per se and that’s more than OK. Also, remember that finding your true passions is one thing, but pursuing them can be a whole mess involving cultural, financial and personal troubles. That being said, I would like to believe that figuring out a way to include those passions into your life is not impossible. My Latin teacher loved working with technology but, as you would guess, taught Latin of all things. Yet, she made it work advocating for one-to-one programs within the Latin department that allowed students to help faculty with technology-related issues. Now, she’s kicking ass as a faculty director while also still being able to see students in the classroom. 
In that journey to find what you want to do, it can be easy to feel small, insignificant, as if you don’t belong or as if nobody cares about how you feel — like when people ask “what  you doin’” but never “how you doin’.” Making choices that allow you to be yourself and respecting your personal integrity can be hard at first, but nobody said that the journey to prosperity was inherently straightforward. So set realistic goals for yourself and realistic expectations on the relationships you make with others; never invest more than you can afford to lose. Prosperity also means being your whole self. It means knowing your limits and also what you want out of something. It means being mature and responsible for your actions too. Sometimes projects or ideas will not unravel as imagined; sometimes life plans can take a detour; sometimes relationships are not going to go the distance. That’s life, but it’s not the end of it.
So, when life has got you down and you are feeling at the bottom of the barrel, remember that prosperity is a long-term investment too. Making immediate lifestyle changes now is not going to guarantee that you will feel prosperous in a week or so. It’s the culmination of those changes throughout the course of your life that end up with that sweet, winning feeling. Love yourself first and foremost because loving others with a broken heart or spirit is just going to make you feel defeated when you’re not fulfilled. 
Live life doing what you want to do, and know that it’s never too late to make a change even when the world makes it feel wrong. Wealth and prosperity, according to my teacher, do not always come in material form but may surprisingly lead to material gain if you are able to love yourself and make strong, lasting relationships with those around you.

As California fully reopens its economy, USC is relaxing outdoor masking, physical distancing and Trojan Check requirements but waiting for additional guidance before further loosening restrictions, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Friday. 
The University will issue new guidance in the next few weeks based on California  Division of Occupational Safety and Health, state and county guidelines, Van Orman said. The CAL/OSHA guidelines are currently the strictest of the three, recommending that all employees continue wearing masks while the state recommends that only workers who are unvaccinated need to wear masks. As the University must follow all these requirements, much of the campus — particularly employees — will remain masked until further guidance. 
“We’re subject to all of these requirements, so in essence, we have to follow the [guidelines] that are the strictest,” Van Orman said. “So prior to this, if the county were stricter, we would have to follow that.”. 
As USC prepares guidelines for the summer and upcoming semester, Van Orman said that the University will continue to push vaccinations and encourages students to upload their proofs of vaccinations. 
“There’s a lot we can do as a campus if we know that we have community immunity … The big push right now is we need everyone to get vaccinated if they’re not, and submit their vaccine status so that we can say confidently to people, ‘When you come to USC, 89.2% of people are vaccinated,’” Van Orman said. 
In line with event capacity guidelines, the University announced that the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will fully reopen in the fall. While full capacity is permitted for indoor and outdoor events, “mega events,” which have capacities upwards of 5,000 people for indoor events and 10,000 people for outdoor events, may still require proof of vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test, Van Orman said. 
As University officials plan reopening guidelines with the new regulations in mind, USC is expected to return toward normalcy, recovering from a pandemic that killed hundreds of Los Angeles residents every day just a few months ago. Remembering countless conversations with employees and students who have lost family members, Van Orman feels relief but urges caution.
“I’m proud of the team here who’s really focused first and foremost on keeping people safe, keeping our employees and our students safe,” Van Orman said. “Now to think we’re going to be able to come back to normal — it’s really exciting. Get your vaccine, please get your vaccine.”
