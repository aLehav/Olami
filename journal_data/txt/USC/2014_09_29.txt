On Sunday, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a “yes means yes” bill into law — the first in the nation to define when and how sexual activity can be consented to in colleges and universities throughout the state.
The law is the first in the nation to legislate affirmative consent, meaning that parties to sexual activity must give “affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity,” according to the bill.
Consent must be given throughout the stages of sexual activity. Silence or lack of protest is not a form of consent as specified within the bill.
The bill specifically requires colleges and universities within the state to conform to standards and protocol about how sexual assault reports can be handled.
Ainsley Carry, vice provost of student affairs, said that several colleges and universities throughout the state were involved in advising the governor’s office on the bill, including USC and Stanford University.
He emphasized USC’s current initiatives, the most recent of which were announced in an Aug. 27 memo to the student body, are in compliance with the law.
Among the law’s requirements is that California educational institutions must “adopt detailed and victim-centered policies and protocols regarding sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving a student that comport with best practices and current professional standards.”
Carry said that drug and alcohol use is a prevalent factor in the reports of sexual assault he has encountered.
“Alcohol and drugs impair judgment whether it’s driving, playing with a gun, playing sports, climbing up steps, climbing down steps or using heavy equipment or getting on a ladder,” Carry said. “Alcohol impairs judgment in a host of matters and sexual conduct is one of them.”
He added that drug and alcohol use is not a problem unique to USC.
“I will say as a fact, that every case that has reached my desk, not just at USC but in my 20 years of administration, alcohol or drugs [are] involved,” Carry said.
Shyann Murphy, co-director of the Women’s Student Assembly, said that the law is a good step, but that more needs to be done regarding societal conceptions of consent.
“I would go further to say that consent needs to be ongoing, informed and enthusiastic, meaning that your partner always knows what’s happening during any act,” Murphy said. “Consent needs to be ongoing, meaning that just because one person consents to touching, doesn’t mean they consent to intercourse.”
The bill, now law, has received criticism for how administrators and other officials should enforce its provisions.
“It’s better to have a definitive law as opposed to leaving it open-ended,” Elizabeth Turner, a senior majoring in human biology, said. “I think it’ll be hard to employ and can see how it would be difficult to enforce saying yes at every phase, and people might just lie about it, which could be a difficulty.”
Murphy said that solutions to the greater issue of sexual violence need to involve changes in personal behavior as well as government action.
“We need legislation that’s strongly worded that says, ‘if you rape somebody, there are going to be consequences’ in order for society to start taking that seriously,” she said. “But society needs to start taking that one step further and educate itself on what rape is, what sexual assault is, what consent is, before we can have any type of meaningful change. So, one can’t really go without the other.”
Student-led initiatives are designed to go hand in hand with California’s revised definition of consent. Carry noted that members of Undergraduate Student Government and the Women’s Student Assembly have met in developing the university’s response to issues of sexual misconduct.
One such initiative, Trojans Respect Consent, is a social media campaign designed to increase consent awareness and provide bystander education.
Christie Hennes, senior director of communications for USG, described Trojans Respect Consent as a centralized hub of information.
“We are aware that there are many other student groups and departments taking action against sexual assault, and we want a place for all of this information to be congregated into a single area,” she said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Rini Sampath, USG vice president, said that student government has been planning for the bill’s passage.
“We definitely had [the law] in mind when we created [Trojans Respect Consent] in the first place,” Sampath said. “We were thinking ahead, and we had an idea it would get passed, so the first thing we’re focusing on is the idea of what consent means in the state of California.”
Murphy expressed that universities must place a greater emphasis on accountability in responding to the problem of sexual violence.
“I want to see the momentum from ‘yes means yes’ continue to go forward and continue to address the culture of rape on campus and hold rapists accountable,” she said.

USC will be offering a new two-unit class next spring,  MEDS 380: “Stem Cells: Fact and Fiction,” which will explore contemporary topics in stem cell biology and how innovative applications in the future can close the gap between scientific reality and science fiction predictions.
Believe it or not · Professor Gage Crump, above, will lead the new two-unit class MEDS 380: Stem Cells: Fact and Fiction next spring. – Photo courtesy of Gage Crump
The class will be offered as an elective for a minor in health care studies but is open to all majors, provided that they have taken or have credit for a general biology course.
Erin Yamauchi, program specialist for the health care studies minor, believes that this class will provide students another outlet to explore professions in the health care world.
“This will provide better career advising — better planning in terms of whether you pursue a M.D. or Ph.D. program,” she said.  “MEDS 380: Stem Cells: Fact and Fiction, actually came about because we wanted to tie in the health sciences to a lot of other arenas … understanding that the health care field touches upon economics, social, and of course, liberal arts implications.”
Designed as an interdisciplinary course, MEDS 380 will incorporate aspects of the liberal arts with hard sciences such as biochemistry and organic chemistry. Yamauchi said the idea for the class was largely faculty initiated because the class isn’t similar to anything done before and it is something that students were unlikely to even conceptualize.
“This is almost a course that students couldn’t even fathom because science students are so used to the regular chemistry, biology, organic chemistry and all the typical pre-health classes, “ she said.
Yamauchi also introduced the involvement of Professor Gage Crump, who will be leading the course next semester.
“We had a professor who has significant background in stem cells and who also wanted to incorporate his interest in science fiction [to] really develop students’ understanding of how science and the creations of science- — research and discovery — relates to a larger context, to literature and social issues,” she said.
A stem cell researcher at USC, Professor Crump explained the value of the course to students interested in stem cell biology as well as the liberal arts.
“There wasn’t really a class in stem cell biology for undergraduates, so we wanted to offer a class in that topic, but we still didn’t want to offer your standard kind of science course,” Crump said.  “We wanted to offer a course that would get students interested in the field early on. I think by combining that film and literature with science might be interesting.”
Crump has interests outside of academia, especially in science fiction literature. Crump finds parallels between the visions of science fiction novelists and the real applications of stem cells. He gave the example of Margaret Atwood’s novel, Oryx and Crake.
Crump said that real farm animals become rare luxuries in Atwood’s dystopian society and are replaced by synthetic foods. He then relates Atwood’s dystopian world to aspects found in our society.
“Recently, [researchers] have been taking skin cells and reprogramming them into muscle cells and growing them in dish and making a synthetic burger,” he said.
Crump also looks forward to the interdisciplinary effects of the course.
“There’s been a real initiative to try to have collaborative efforts with people in other schools throughout USC, particularly the arts department,” he said. “Because I think these ideas of stem cells, genetic engineering and regeneration captures the public’s attention. I think our immersion as a role in society include navigating current trends, portraying them to the general public and being an engine for creating ideas.”
Nikhil Kotha, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering and minoring in health care studies, expressed interested in the class. He thinks that this course will help give students perspective on the health care world since he believes pre-health students can easily lose sight of the bigger picture when immersed in their science courses.
“I chose this minor in the first place to get more experience or get ‘back inside’ the health care world and learn about the major systems that are not from a strictly scientific standpoint — like social policy — that play into health care,” he said. “As premeds, we go through a lot of classes that are straight and narrow whereas [MEDS 380] can give students an overview of the current field and allow students to step back to remember why they are doing all this and realize what out there is possible.”

The Institute for Armenian Studies hosted a discussion on Monday called “A Middle East with No Minorities,” featuring Dr. Paul Haidostian, president of Haigazian University in Beirut. The discussion focused on the impact of conflict in the Middle East on minorities.
 
What follows is the percentage Muslim demographic in the following countries.
Bear in mind when studying these statistics that in every one of these countries 1,400 years ago (or less) Islam did not even exist.  This illustrates what happens to minorities under Islamic control.
Afghanistan 100% Muslim
(Once Buddhist, Hindu)
Algeria  99%
Muslim  (Once Berber)
Bahrain 100% Muslim
(Once Zoroastrain, Christian)
Iraq  95% Muslim  (Once Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian)
Iran  98% Muslim  (Once Christian, Zoroastrian, etc…)
Morocco  99%
Muslim  (Once Berber, Christian, etc…)
Mauritania  100%
Muslim (Once Animist)
Somalia  100%
Muslim  (Once Animist, etc…)
Saudi Arabia  100%
Muslim  (Once Jewish, Christian,
Zoroastrian, etc…)
Sudan  97%  Muslim
(Recent history teaches us what happened to all the non-Muslims in
Sudan.  It’s called genocide.)

Salesforce, a cloud technology company, announced last week that it is partnering with USC in order to increase fundraising among alumni.
Tracey Vranich, vice president for advancement services, is responsible for working with Salesforce in order to bring the new Advancement Connect app to USC by the fall of 2015.
The app will allow for a streamlined database of alumni and donors by organizing donor history, alumni participation, season ticket holder information and alumni careers into one database. This will enable USC to increase its ability to reach out to all USC constituents in order to receive more gifts. The university recently passed the halfway mark of its $6 billion fundraising campaign.
“We currently use Oracle’s PeopleSoft for our advancement database,” Vranich said. “That is where we have all our alumni records of giving histories, just like every university does.”
Salesforce was founded by USC alumnus Marc Benioff ’86, who spoke at the 2014 USC commencement ceremony in May.
USC is one of four schools that are the first to use Salesforce. The other three universities connected with Salesforce are Cornell University, Arizona State University and College for America at Southern New Hampshire University.
According to USC News, USC is ranked third among U.S. universities in the amount of fundraising done annually. During the initial phases of expanding Salesforce to other universities, Vranich posed this question to the company: “How do universities that are in the top 10 fundraising in higher education need to process gifts and what do they need to develop the best relationships with their constituents?”
Advancement Connect will allow for fundraising to occur on the mobile level “in a way USC has never seen before,” Vranich said.
The mobile capacities could allow for the ability to streamline fundraising and integrate with student crowdfunding and social media in order to have participants at student-run events text donations in order to encourage younger alumni and students to contribute to USC.
“We are thinking about incorporating this with the [senior gift] text to give because we have one of the highest participation of senior gifts at universities,” Vranich said. Alumni of the 2014 graduating class were given the option of texting their donations for the first time.
The Advancement Connect app will allow for students to be more involved in fundraising for USC.
“I think this will dramatically improve fundraising because the quicker and the more efficient the method, the more will be generated,” said Raquel Buscaino, a freshman majoring in physics and computer science. “People don’t have time to use traditional fundraising methods. The more we adapt for technology, the more we can generate.”
Advancement Connect will be officially unveiled in 2015.
“We are really excited to use technology to finish the second part of the $6 billion campaign,” Vantrich said.

For Trojan fans, it’s going to be easy to look forward to ASU this weekend — but they shouldn’t let last Saturday’s game against Oregon State out of the rearview mirror just yet. The contest against the Beavers was the ugliest 35-10 win I’ve ever seen. Some of us will point to the 7:30 p.m. kickoff time, others still will point to the fact the Trojans managed to give up 124 yards on 14 penalties.
I, for one, will never forget how running backs Justin Davis and Buck Allen kept running to the sideline in the fourth quarter and stopping the clock. A close friend of mine who was watching the game on TV spotted me on ESPN looking almost as excited as a colonoscopy patient in a doctor’s waiting room. Let’s just say the pregame merriment wore off at about halftime.
If I could describe the Oregon State game in one word, it would be “sluggish.” Head coach Steve Sarkisian came out and said the team played aggressively. There’s another word for the type of so-called “aggression” the Trojans displayed when they racked up penalties on Saturday: sloppiness. Sure, nine of them came from freshmen, but two of those were costly face mask penalties on team captain and senior linebacker Hayes Pullard.
Oregon State ranks third-to-last nationally for penalties, at 11.0 penalties per game. They had 13 penalties on Saturday. The Trojans, never one to be outdone when it comes to defying authority, had 14. And they still won, by more than three touchdowns. It wasn’t so much about how well USC played as it was about how Oregon State simply lost the war of attrition against a supremely talented team.
The Trojan offense looked only slightly less listless than the Beavers defense as USC marched down the field for drives of 65, 87 and 88 yards.
To USC’s credit, the defense completely shut down Oregon State quarterback Sean Mannion. To USC’s detriment, Mannion had virtually no weapons despite the Trojans’ coverage packages giving him enough time in the pocket to make a sandwich before he threw the ball. Oregon State’s sole receiver with more than 17 yards was 6-foot-3 Richard Mullaney, who managed 78 yards on five receptions before completely stalling in the second half. With former Beaver wide receiver and 2013 Biletnikoff Award winner Brandin Cooks in the NFL and Victor Boldin out due to injury, it was clear Mannion was at a loss as to how to exploit the Trojans’ secondary.
If Taylor Kelly gets the start this Saturday, Arizona State will have no such problems. ASU’s offense is its best defense, and I’m not just saying that because they gave up 62 points to that one school across town last week. I’m saying that because they dropped 62 points on the Trojans last year and promptly stranded Darth Visor in an airport parking lot.
I know I wrote a column last week about how Cody Kessler isn’t a game manager, and the game plan this week, according to Sarkisian on Monday’s Ripsit Blog, was to “pass to set up the run.” But if Saturday’s offense against a banged up Oregon State was any indication, the Trojans aren’t going to be able to hang in shootout games this season.
Therefore, it’s all the more imperative that USC doesn’t get torched in the passing game if it wants to win at home against Arizona State. Junior wide receiver Jaelen Strong is looking like he’ll surpass the numbers from his 1,122- yard season in 2013 — the 6-foot-3, 215-pound Philadelphia-born behemoth is averaging over 100 yards a game this season. Even more intriguing than Strong is ASU running back and dark horse Heisman Trophy candidate DJ Foster. Foster can catch the ball out of the backfield and has 747 yards from the line of scrimmage through four games this season, including a flat-out scary 8.6 yards per carry. My point is this: Arizona State presents an entirely new animal for the Trojans this week. Forget that Mike Bercovici threw a costly 95-yard pick six last week against UCLA, the Sun Devils have the weapons to rip through USC’s defense and put the Trojans’ measured attack behind in a hurry.
USC has a lot to improve on before it steps on the field this Saturday. Last week’s win over Oregon State wasn’t so much of a bounce back game as it was a team in progress, and it’s high time USC answers the call by putting an end to its sloppy mistakes and executing to its full potential.

USC’s men’s and women’s tennis teams are traveling to their ITA All-American tournaments this week to kick off their 2014-15 seasons.
Top dog · Senior Yannick Hanfman is set to take over the top singles spot for USC this season. Hanfmann is the nation’s No. 2 singles player. – Daily Trojan File Photo
The USC men’s team, which is coming off its fifth NCAA Championship in the last six seasons, heads to Tulsa, Oklahoma, for some tough competition.
Three Trojans are slated to play in the main draw, which begins on Thursday, Oct. 2. Senior Yannick Hanfmann, who is ranked No. 2 in the nation following the 2013-2014 season in which he went 24-6 overall, will likely earn a top seed on the men’s side.
Hanfmann will be joined in the main draw by two teammates: No. 33 senior Roberto Quiroz and No. 39 senior Jonny Wang.
Quiroz posted 32 wins and only six losses last season, and Wang, a local product out of San Marino High School, went 21-8.
Last year, former Trojan standout Ray Sarmiento led the charge for USC at the ITA All-American, making it as far as the Round of 16. Quiroz and Wang both fell in the Round of 32 after pulling off first round upsets.
Junior Max de Vroome and senior Eric Johnson, ranked No. 47 and No. 124 in the nation, respectively, both competed in the qualifying round in attempts to earn spots in the main draw.
Johnson squared off against Texas A&M’s unranked A.J. Catanzariti, who fought his way out of the pre-qualifying rounds over the weekend. Johnson fell in three sets by a final score of 6-4, 6-7(5), 6-3.
De Vroome went up against the Denver’s unranked Alex Gasson and suffered a narrow straight set defeat, 7-6(5), 6-4.
De Vroome and Johnson aren’t done in Tulsa, though. They will pair up and compete in the main doubles draw, as will Hanfmann and Quiroz, who are ranked No. 19 in the nation together.
While the men were shipped off to Oklahoma, the Women of Troy get to stay close to home this week, competing at the Riviera Tennis Club in Pacific Palisades, California in the ITA/Riviera Women’s All-American Championships.
Over the weekend, a couple young Women of Troy competed in the prequalifying rounds in singles.
Freshman Gabby Smith, who hails from Henderson, Nevada, went up against Florida’s No. 99 Belinda Woolcock, who had earned the third seed in the prequalifying draw. Smith, who is unranked in the national poll but No. 8 in the preseason newcomer/freshman rankings, pulled off an easy upset by a 6-1, 6-4 score.
In the next round she went up against Florida State’s Daneika Borthwick but fell 7-5, 6-1, ending her run in the tournament.
Fellow freshman Meredith Xepoleas also secured a first-round upset. The Rancho Mirage, California native topped Florida State’s No. 121 Kerrie Cartwright, 2-6, 7-6(3), 6-2. In the second round, she fell to Middle Tennessee’s Tiffany William, 6-2, 6-2.
Though these rising stars failed to make it into the main draw, USC will still be well-represented.
Senior Zoë Scandalis, ranked No. 15 in the nation, already earned a spot in the main draw, which starts on Thursday, Oct. 2.
Last year, Scandalis posted a 23-11 total record and filled in admirably at the top singles slot for teammate Sabrina Santamaria, who was lost for the season with a torn ACL.
Today, No. 38 junior Giuliana Olmos and No. 59 sophomore Zoë Katz will compete in the qualifying round to try to make their way into the main draw to join Scandalis.
Olmos will battle Vanderbilt’s No. 50 Sydney Campbell, while Katz will play Wichita State’s Julia Schiller, who is ranked No. 41 in the nation.
Both of these Women of Troy will play in the doubles main draw as well.
Olmos will partner up with Scandalis to represent USC. This duo went 22-8 on the season last year and finished the year ranked No. 11 in the nation. Last year, they made it to the finals of this tournament, but ultimately fell to UCLA’s Robin Anderson and Jennifer Brady.
The year before, Santamaria and since-graduated Kaitlyn Christian took home the title. Santamaria is still out of commission while recovering from her ACL surgery but hopes to be back in action soon.
Should Olmos and Scandalis falter, another young pair might still be in the running. Katz is pairing up with freshman Madison Westby in the main draw of the doubles tournament. Katz and Westby are ranked No. 23 in the nation together.
Main draw action for both the men’s and women’s tournaments begin on Oct. 2 and results can be viewed online.

Despite a bumpy start against Oregon State on Saturday night, USC is now 2-0 in conference play for the first time since 2007 after defeating the Beavers 35-10 at the Coliseum.
Seize the Davis · Sophomore tailback Justin Davis found the endzone twice in Saturday’s victory over Oregon State, once on the ground and once through the air. Davis has 203 yards and three total touchdowns this season. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
 
The Trojans (3-1, 2-0) moved up two spots to No. 16 in this week’s AP Poll, and they will return to the practice field on Tuesday in hopes of avoiding a letdown like the one that took place against Boston College on Sept. 13.
The team will spend the week preparing for an Arizona State squad that had then-No. 11 UCLA on the ropes with a 17-6 lead in the first half in Tempe, Arizona, though the Bruins eventually responded with a 42-point scoring outburst on the way to a 62-27 victory over the now unranked Sun Devils (3-1, 1-1).
Retribution will also be on the line for the Trojans, as they look to get back at the Sun Devils for a humiliating 62-41 stomping last season that ended up being Lane Kiffin’s last game as head coach.
It remains questionable whether the Sun Devils will be with or without their star quarterback, Taylor Kelly, who missed the UCLA game after injuring his right foot in the team’s 38-24 win over Colorado.
ASU head coach Todd Graham said that Kelly’s foot will be reevaluated on Wednesday and that Kelly is currently “pretty questionable” to play in Saturday’s game.
For now, it looks like redshirt junior quarterback Mike Bercovici, who threw for nearly 500 yards and three touchdowns but also had three turnovers against UCLA, will get the start for the Sun Devils.
As always for USC head coach Steve Sarkisian, the focus for this week will be on making adjustments and getting better, and he addressed some potential improvements in his weekly teleconference.
One of the areas that Sarkisian emphasized was sophomore safety Su’a Cravens’s move to the linebacker position in the first half of the Oregon State game.
“We were hopeful that we could have increased [his role] by last night,” Sarkisian said. “It’s just, I don’t think Su’a [Cravens] or ourselves were comfortable enough with him being in there with that unit with some of the calls we had. It’ll be a point of emphasis of ours this week. He definitely has playmaking ability.”
The Los Angeles native had arguably his best game in a USC uniform with a team-high six tackles, a sack and a 31-yard interception return for a touchdown in the first quarter to give his team an early 7-0 lead.
As for areas of improvement, Sarkisian emphasized special teams after the team allowed a 97-yard kick return for a touchdown and senior kicker Andre Heidari shanked a 36-yard field goal.
“That’s a problem, and we need to fix it,” Sarkisian said.
The first-year head coach added that the team’s running backs, redshirt junior Javorius “Buck” Allen and sophomore Justin Davis, who combined for 197 yards on 35 carries, were going down too easily in one-on-one situations.
“When you’re one-on-one, that should be an advantage,” Sarkisian said.
Discipline is another area that the Trojans could improve on, as they were penalized 14 times for a total of 124 yards against the Beavers.
Sarkisian said that he doesn’t mind the increased number of flags by Pac-12 officials as long as they are consistent and call the game both ways.
As far as injuries go, the Trojans have stayed healthy for the most part. Sarkisian mentioned, however, that redshirt sophomore offensive lineman Jordan Simmons suffered a bone bruise on his knee in practice towards the end of last week and will be out for one to two weeks.
USC’s Saturday tilt will kick off at 4:30 p.m. PST and will be nationally televised on FOX.

The fast food industry has given comfort foods a bad reputation. Classic dishes such as macaroni and cheese, hamburgers and chili are often laden with processed ingredients and refined sugars. Even seemingly healthy fast-food options such as salads and wraps lack the honesty and wholesome flavor of their homemade counterparts.
One-pan delights · These fried rice recipes can offer layers of flavor with a quick and easy preparation that even beginners can pick up quickly. The ability to mix assorted ingredients allows for a nice variety. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
One of my goals with this column is to show college students that cooking delicious food from scratch is easy, affordable and incredibly gratifying. Fried rice, a Chinese takeout staple, quells carbohydrate cravings without providing much nutritional value. My homemade version delivers the deeply savory flavor of its fast food counterpart using minimal oil and vibrant fresh vegetables.
Ideal for busy weeknights, this one-pan recipe comes together in minutes. Simply sauté the mushrooms and broccoli, mix in the rice and serve. Even beginners can execute the quick method; just make sure to prepare all of the components before starting the cooking process.
 
While I provide exact ingredient proportions, you can apply the technique to whatever vegetables or greens you have on hand. For a more substantive meal, feel free to top the dish with a grilled protein such as salmon or tofu.
Even if you do not follow this recipe, pre-cooked brown rice forms an excellent base for countless inspired meals. To maximize efficiency, I recommend making a large batch over the weekend, then storing it in the refrigerator for easy access throughout the week. Even if you are hesitant about learning to cook, stocking your kitchen with smart staples is the first step to embracing an epicurean dorm.

Five USC fraternity brothers have utilized the relationships they have forged in college to start their own clothing company, Kamala Trunks, which launched last month. What started as a common frustration between two freshman dorm neighbors to find the perfect pair of fashion-forward but still functional trunks turned into a five-man business after their fraternity brothers and friends hopped on board. Daniel Metoudi and Alex Jamiolkowski, both current juniors majoring in business administration, came up with the original vision. They then recruited Jonathan Tannenbaum, a junior majoring in business administration; Jonathan Delman, a junior majoring in communication; and Devon Mychal, a senior majoring in communication.
Shorts story · The creators of Kamala Shorts noticed a niche for shorter and less baggy European-styled shorts at affordable prices. – Photo courtesy of Kamala
Jamiolkowski and Metoudi found themselves drawn to the brands of shorts from Europe, Australia and New Zealand  but found that those brands often didn’t ship to the United States, or if they did, they cost upward of $125.
“[The shorts sold by] all of the brands in the U.S. were a bit longer, a bit baggier, the prints were tackier,” Metoudi said. “We noticed that a lot of people started wearing shorter shorts, and that was kind of our style too. We realized that there just weren’t enough options available for American consumer even though [shorter and less baggy shorts]were a trend that was picking up.”
Because of this, they created Kamala Trunks to fill what they saw as a void in the shorts market.
“We really made it from an idea into a business all together,” Delman said.
The trunks are named after Kamala Beach in Thailand because the five friends hope to capture the carefree lifestyle of that location in their brand. “Kamala” also means “lotus flower,” — which is the brand’s logo — in Hindi. The shorts come in various colors and designs, but each individual pair comes in a backpack that matches the trunks with the lotus flower insignia on the outside. The shorts are made with 100 percent peach-faced polyester and are printed through digital dye sublimation, a technology that prevents the fading and wear and tear that often accompany the salt, sun and chlorine of beaches and pools.The solid color shorts sell for $55, and the printed shorts sell for $65,  which the students say is less than half of how much Kamala’s competitors sell them for.
“One of the highlights is the lifestyle behind our brand and that you can literally wear them for anything,” Jamiolkowski said. “If you’re going to the beach or going to the bar or doing whatever, you don’t have to change,  and that’s one of the big things behind our brand.”
The five members each hold distinct roles in the company based on their majors and particular areas of strength. Metoudi, a Hong Kong native, uses his connections back home to work with Chinese designers as well as the Chinese factory that produces their product. Tannenbaum is in charge of the company’s finances. Jamiolkowski works mostly with design and media content. Mychal focuses his efforts on marketing, and Delman is in charge of public relations and business operations.
“The best employees, in my mind, are students that I know from USC, one of the top schools in the world,” Metoudi said. “It’s just a great group of guys.”
The students behind Kamala Trunks also credit the university with helping them get to this point.
“This was a really cool experience in that we are actually getting to take things that we’re learning in our business classes and apply them everyday,” Tannenbaum said. “There have been instances where I have popped my head in to [see] an accounting professor I had a few semesters prior and asked a question about what’s the proper way to account for this specific type of transaction we had to deal with.”
With the launch of their company last month, the students behind Kamala Trunks are setting their sights on getting into retail. Though they are mostly targeting boutiques around the Los Angeles and San Diego areas for now, they hope that five to 10 years down the line, they will be able to move their business into department stores such as Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue and Harrods.
“We consider our product to be quite a high quality brand, so we are trying to hit boutiques that emphasize that quality, that uniqueness and style and design,” Metoudi said. “It’s really important to get into a store that really emphasizes the same sort of message or vibe that [we’re] trying to give off.”
As a young, small business, Kamala Trunks looks forward to future collaborations and networking among USC students and people in the Los Angeles area to help them improve its brand.
“We are always looking to connect with other entrepreneurs, people in the fashion business, designers. Anyone that is interested at all, check out our website, send us an email,” Delman said. “We’re very reachable, we’re still young, we want to connect and reach out as much as possible.”
Kamala Trunks are available for purchase exclusively at their website, www.kamalatrunks.com, and can be reached by email at info@kamalatrunks.com.

Hardly a household name, Sacramento noise-rock outfit Tera Melos’s experimental brand of in-your-face punk and prog-rock/jazz technicality often confuses and alienates listeners. But those who like it, really like it. For about 10 years now, the group has been steadily releasing material, touring the country and building a solid following of devoted fans. Even though the music is unpredictable, Tera Melos shows are filled with fans who know every word and anticipate every wild turn.
When you’re strange · Tera Melos finds the right balance between their eclectic sound and a pop-like catchiness in their latest album, X’ed Out. Their videos, created by Behn Fannin, embody their odd spirit. – Photo courtesy of Andy Patch
The trio — comprised of Nick Reinhart on guitar and vocals, Nathan Latona on bass and John Clardy on drums — is currently on tour with Pinback promoting their 2013 release X’ed Out and supporting the latter on their 10-year anniversary tour. They will stop in Los Angeles to play at the El Rey on Oct. 3.
Though the band is often referred to as “math rock,” they generally balk at this classification.
“Math to me is not emotional … It’s lacking humanness. And I think we have a lot of emotion and try to convey something human,” Latona said.
They take a similar stance when asked about their influences. Though they are all big fans of musicians such as Mike Watt, Les Claypool and Trent Reznor, they shy away from emulation.
“We never set out to be any sort of band, or like, ‘Let’s try to sound like these guys,’” Latona said. “There wasn’t much planning or thinking that we would be doing this for the long-term. We just wanted to see what would happen if we put some interesting sounds together.”
Despite jarring stop-and-start song structures and un-danceable time signatures, the group is slowly building a connection and getting the attention that many would say is long overdue. A lot of this might have to do with their latest album, X’ed Out, the most stripped-down and arguably most accessible offering to date.
“I don’t [think taking a minimalist approach] was a reaction to being labeled too ‘out there’ or too cerebral or being called math rock. It’s just a natural progression and the same kind of stuff from our last albums is there, it’s just subtle and underneath. I think it’s cooler that way,” Latona said.
This gradual formation of a unique sonic identity has gone hand in hand with Tera Melos’s visual output. Their music videos all have a similar surrealist, satiric vibe and are directed by short filmmaker Behn Fannin. Their repeated collaborations have resulted in the band donning J-pop-inspired anime outfits, running around Los Angeles in morphsuits and pouring milk on themselves while upside-down. Fannin’s creative impact is noticeable throughout their videos.
“Behn is just a well of ideas,” Latona said. “A lot of the time, we just go along with the vision that he says, but sometimes we’ll give him an idea and see what his version of it would be. It’s always fun and playful. Like, he gets commissioned to do commercials and daytime TV shows, but we like think Tera Melos is where he gets to let loose any of his crazy ideas that wouldn’t fly in any of those other contexts.”
Videos for X’ed Out tracks like “Weird Circles,” “Sunburn” and “Bite” display this child-like absurdity by incorporating toy instruments, men in women’s clothing, hot dogs driving cars and ’80s Clip Art graphics.
X’ed Out has a poppier feel, but is not a drastic departure from past records; their distinctive penchant for hauntingly joyful harmonies over face-melting riffs is as much on display as ever. Perhaps, then, their newfound ability to book a tour with a big-name, somewhat mainstream band Pinback after years of playing basements and small venues is due to a changing musical landscape, not a changing sound. Groups like Death Grips, Boris and Swans all exist in the same noisy musical universe and are enjoying a recent spike in interest amongst fans and critics.
There is a recent boom in the popularity of their type of music, but Latona is skeptical of its effect on their success.
“I don’t know if our fates are necessarily tied to those bands,” he said. “Swans and Boris have been around for a while, and I think it’s just the coolness factor right now. It wasn’t cool to talk about Swans 10 years ago. But that doesn’t necessarily equate to commercial success. Like, McDonald’s isn’t hitting us up to use our song in a commercial.”
Still, there is obvious overlap between Tera Melos and these bands: Tera Melos frontman Nick Reinhart has a side project called Bygones with Death Grips drummer Zach Hill, and they have always been compared to Hill’s other band, Hella. Though Death Grips has disbanded, their song “You Might Think He Loves You For You Money But I Know What He Really Loves You For And It’s Your Brand New Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat,” was recently used for an Adidas commercial, signaling that experimental noise music may have a shot at breaking into the mainstream. Until Tera Melos has a similar breakthrough, though, L.A. fans will have to head to the El Rey Friday night to get a taste of the electrifying experience.

Last Friday, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas delivered an incendiary address to the United Nations General Assembly. His speech was packed with fighting words — rhetoric that, in an ironic twist, has turned out to be points of weakness. 
Though his proposal to end Israeli occupation in the West Bank expresses his people’s frustrations well, Abbas’s fiery language empowers the wrong people in this struggle to bridge the Israeli-Palestinian rift.
“War of genocide,” “racism” and “war machine” on Israel’s part are just a few of the strong, provocative words included in Abbas’s address. No doubt he has reason to use these loaded terms. In an Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’s Gaza Emergency Situation Report, the Palestinian death toll totaled 2,104 — 69 percent of which consisted of civilian casualties.
His very human account of the conflict gives those statistics depth and a glimpse into understanding things from the perspective of the Palestinians.
“The occupying Power has chosen to defy the entire world by launching its war on Gaza,” Abbas said. “Its jets and tanks brutally assassinated lives and devastated the homes, schools and dreams of thousands of Palestinian children, women and men in reality destroying the remaining hopes for peace.”
Yet, for each line that sheds light on the Palestinian side of the story, there are a dozen accusations of genocide that draw attention away from that plea for peace.
The cutting responses from the United States and Israel show how Abbas’s choice of words has backfired on him. “President Abbas’s speech today included offensive characterizations that were deeply disappointing and which we reject,” said Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the State Department.
Just as expected, the “offensive characterizations” are the focus of attention while lines that talk about Abbas’s commitment to maintaining “respect and commitment to international law” don’t seem to be worth mentioning. In their place, lines such as, “We will not forget and we will not forgive” are easily taken out of context to empower the Israeli right wing in painting Abbas as a warmonger, misrepresenting his message and worse, letting go of a chance at peace.
Ironically, it is Abbas’s own words that bear fault. Instead of repeatedly condemning Israel as the bad guy while intermittently inserting his desire for peace, Abbas should have delivered his message with more finesse and consistency. It is definitely understandable to call out the atrocities committed against his people, but not in a way that will cut off all chance of negotiation in the future. Abbas labeled Israel as an enemy when he could have approached the conflict in a way that left the past behind so that an agreement could be reached.
Though Abbas’s efforts “[to aspire] to correct the deficiency” of past negotiations were admirable, his delivery was not. Rather than help his case at ending conflict, the speech seems to have given opponents the power to paint him as a diplomat who has “lost all touch with reality,” as Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Liberman put it.
“It is impossible, and I repeat — it is impossible — to return to the cycle of negotiations that failed to deal with the substance of matter and the fundamental question,” Abbas declared. It’s clear that he’s fed up with talks that lead nowhere, but the bad news is, his own speech seems to be headed down that same road.

I don’t consider President Abbas’ terminology ‘loaded’ but rather painfully accurate. That the response from the US and Israel was predictable in its condemnation merely highlights the fact that the US has long stood in the way of accountability for Israel in the UN and the world community.
William,
Why is it Muslims are free to violently conquer lands anywhere and everywhere without a word of protest from American Muslims, or any Muslims or any liberals?
But if Jews have a legally established homeland Muslims and
Liberals and their ilk will never stop protesting against it? Why is this do
you suppose? What explanation can be given other than as the Qur’an states
repeatedly that Islam’s goal is to establish a worldwide caliphate in which all
non-Muslims are subjugated.
For instance, Mohammed was born around 571 AD thousands and
thousands of years after Hinduism, Buddhism and Judaism existed. But within a few centuries of Mohammed’s birth Islam had violently conquered vast sections of Asia, all of North Africa and smaller sections of Southern Europe.
Now Muslims tell us that all this land belongs to them even
though, for instance, in Afghanistan they killed every last Buddhist who once
lived there. According to Muslim logic per Israel shouldn’t this land belong to
the Buddhists?
Or in North Africa all the Berbers have been forcibly
converted to Islam or have been killed and now we’re told all this vast
landmass belongs to Islam. That’s interesting, if not completely hypocritical.
And what about Southern Thailand. Did anyone know that in
the last several years something like 5,000 Buddhists have been killed by
Muslims because, or so we’re told, the land the Buddhists are on belongs to
Islam.
And Southern Russia? Muslims are relentlessly waging a slow
reign of terror in Russia because, you guessed it, Russians are treating
Muslims poorly and they should give up the Southern section of that country to
Muslims since Islam deserves all lands.
Or, let’s take Sudan as another example. How many millions
have been killed in Sudan? How many babies and children have starved in Sudan while Islamists steal the food from aid compounds? How many women have Muslims gang-raped in Sudan all because that land belongs to Muslims and only Muslims. All other people can go somewhere else to live, I guess. They can go to South Sudan, but wait a minute, now Muslims are killing the people of South Sudan too.
And Kashmir? The same. Despite Hindus having lived there for 3,000 years – something like 2,000+ years before Mohammed was born – Muslims tell us Kashmir belongs to them. Amazing logic isn’t it? Muslim logic, I guess.
And that brings us to Israel. Israel also belongs to Islam too. Did you know that? It’s true. Just ask a Muslim or a liberal if you prefer. Even though it’s no bigger than a small pimple on the caliphate’s ass it is still their land and they will fight to the death to prove their point.
Doesn’t the logic here make a lot of sense. Isn’t it as clear as day? Of course it does. The world belongs to Islam and we’re mere players on their stage.
You left out the part where Israel removed all settlements from Gaza in exchange for peace, but let’s not worry ourselves with minor details, for we all know this is not about seeking truth and justice so much as it is about besmirching Israel.
But the noble  Hamas-led Palestinians – as is typical of their good neighbor policy-
tore up that treaty with Israel, and no sooner had the Israeli settlers left
than the Palestinians started lobbing rocket, after rocket, after rocket into
Israel.  But this is a mere detail, and as noble college students and editorialists we should not be bothered with such trivia.
Instead welcome to our fantasy-world where we pretend that it is the poor-poor Hamas who are the victims:  the good guys in our fictional depiction of this conflict.   For we all know Hamas is an ethical and loving organization for whom respect for core values such as women’s rights, gay rights, Jew’s rights, freedom of conscience, the sanctity of life – are all paramount.  
In short, Orwell could not make this crap up it is that far detached from reality.

In perhaps his most fiery speech since this past summer’s violence between Israel and Hamas, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas addressed the United Nations General Assembly Friday, blasting Israel for conducting a “war of genocide” over its 50-day operation in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of more than 2,000 Palestinians and 69 Israelis. In his speech, Abbas stated that he would seek a U.N. resolution to establish a deadline to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory captured in the War of 1967. 
In response, both Israeli and American officials blasted the speech as a provocative statement that “undermine[d] efforts to create a positive atmosphere and restore trust between the parties,” as stated by State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.
But those wishing to write off Abbas’s speech as contrary to the interests of peace are not listening carefully enough.
Though Abbas’s sentiments were filled with charged language, using terms such as “genocidal crime” and “racism” to capture the Palestinian people’s frustration with this past summer’s violence, that wasn’t all the leader said. In fact, underneath all that rhetoric, Abbas’s ultimate message has remained the same: a commitment to ending the occupation and achieving a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital based on 1967 borders alongside a secure State of Israel.
Before passing judgment on Abbas’s rhetoric, it is important to understand where he is coming from. For starters, his speech was made following not only one of the most violent operations the region has seen in recent memory, but also the Israeli government’s decision to illegally annex nearly 1,000 acres of Palestinian land. Amid the bloodshed and continued settlement expansion, it’s almost laughable that the United States and Israel would accuse Abbas of undermining the peace process when such negotiations have yet to lead to any real substantive results.
It is clear from his appeal that Abbas has no interest in returning to the cycle of negotiations that have proven to be largely futile over the past two decades. His intention to pursue unilateral action through the United Nations indicates he is no longer content with the status quo, and instead intends to pursue future negotiations with Israel not as a nation under occupation, but as the president of an internationally recognized country and a serious partner for a peaceful resolution.
Abbas is no fool — he is well aware that the U.N. General Assembly has no real political teeth and that any substantive measure approved will be vetoed by the United States should it attain a majority in the Security Council. But by addressing the United Nations in such a way, Abbas is making his stance clear: The era of fruitless and repetitive attempts at negotiation is over.
Rather than grasp at straws to paint Abbas as a threat to peace, both American and Israeli leadership ought to engage in meaningful action to bring an immediate end to the occupation, and a legitimate return to negotiations. With the recent announcement of the Palestinian Authority assuming control over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as well as Hamas’s support of the establishment of a Palestinian State within 1967 borders, the opportunity to move forward and reach a long-term solution to this interminable conflict is imminent.
It would be a shame to waste it.

Israel’s actions constitute genocide by the UN definitions (brought about in part because of the atrocities committed against various peoples during WWII). The UN also condemns seizing territory by conquest.
Israel should also withdraw immediately from the United Nations
(whose full name seems more accurately to be UNAI, the United Nations Against
Israel) and help found a robust league of democracies, a new body where human
rights violators don’t preside over human rights councils and where blocs of
Islamists and communists don’t dictate to progressive republics. The UN might
have arguably been the greatest endeavor man ever embarked upon; instead, it is a tiresome farce run by malevolent circus clowns. This is one club to which the
Jew, and the Jewish State, should not belong and not wish to belong.
Turn the UN into a homeless shelter so that at least it does some good for the world. Wait a minute–if we do that, the entire New York City prostitution industry will be devastated.
“his speech was made following not only one of the most violent operations the region has seen in recent memory” This is either willful ignorance or extreme naïveté on the part of the author. If you are looking for violent operations in the region see ISIS crucifixions and attempted genocide, Assad Chemical Weapons, etc. It is true that this was a violent operation, but to call it one of the most violent when nearly 200 TIMES that many have died just north in the Syrian civil war is anti-semitism or careless writing, neither of which have a place in this publication.
There is no “Palestine”. There might have been, but they chose war instead-
time and again:
The would-have-been “Palestinians” would have had a state IN PEACE in 1937 with the Peel Plan, but they violently rejected it.
They would have had a state IN PEACE in 1939 with the MacDonald White Paper, but they violently rejected it (and Jews would have even been restricted from BUYING
land from Arabs).
They would have had a state IN PEACE in 1948 with UN 181, but they violently rejected it (and actually claimed that the UN had no such mandate!).
They could have had a state IN PEACE in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza from 1948-1967 without any Jews- because the Arabs had ethnically cleansed every last one; but they violently rejected it. In fact, that’s exactly when they established Fatah
(1959) and the PLO (1964).
They could have had a state IN PEACE after 1967, but instead, the entire Arab world
issued the Khartoum Resolutions:
A. No peace with Israel
B. No recognition of Israel
C. No negotiations with Israel
They would have had a state IN PEACE in 2000 with the Oslo Accords, but they
violently rejected it- as always.
And as soon as Israel pulled every single Israeli out of Gaza, what did the
would-have-been “Palestinians” do? They immediately started shooting thousands
of missiles into Israeli population centers, they elected Hamas (whose official
platform calls for jihad with no negotiations until Israel is destroyed) to
rule them, and they have dug tunnels crossing into the Negev to kill and kidnap
Israelis.
And even afterwards, Ehud Olmert made his subsequent generous offer that went far beyond even that of Barak. The would-have-been “Palestinians” rejected it.
They had many chances.
They threw them all away because destroying Israel was higher on their priority
list. It still is.
Oh well. That’s their choice.

Love him or hate him, Derek Jeter gave sports fans one last moment to cherish with a walk-off RBI single in his final game at Yankee Stadium last Thursday.
It wasn’t a ball blasted out of the park for a home run. It wasn’t a hit to clinch game seven of the World Series. It wasn’t even a hit to move the Yankees into playoff position, for which they had long been out of contention. And yet, the overwhelming simplicity of Jeter’s line-drive single into shallow right field seemed to underscore everything his career has been about, in a way the “RE2PECT” marketing fluff never could.
Derek Jeter ends his 20-year career as the Yankees’ all-time leader in hits with 3,465. — Al Bello | Getty Images
Jeter continued to eye victory despite the playoff implications or lack thereof, and he knocked in a base hit as he had done hundreds of times before. Via a simple, no flash or no flair base knock, Captain Clutch stayed clutch until the very end.
For most college students, they have never known an MLB without Derek Jeter, who made his MLB debut in 1995. With Captain Clutch delivering a performance and ending that screamed “vintage Jeter” last Thursday, we received one more chance to appreciate what the Yankees icon has offered baseball for the past two decades. But as one of the latest and greatest dominos to fall, Jeter also reminded us to appreciate a broader stratum of superstar that now borders on the edge of extinction – the 1990s-generation superstar.
The players whom college-aged sports aficionados grew up watching, the generation of guys who matured into the games of basketball, football, baseball and so on while we matured into the game of life, are now in the end days of their careers. Father time is undefeated, and he appears to be calling it for big names from the 1990s across all sports.
In the NFL, Peyton Manning is currently the only starting quarterback to have been drafted in the 1990s (Tom Brady was drafted in 2000), while making his first start for the Indianapolis Colts in 1998.
With one super bowl ring and countless NFL passing records under his belt, Manning has leaped into the “best quarterback ever” discussion, but having undergone neck surgery and appearing in multiple Super Bowls already, Manning has himself garnered speculation of potentially calling it quits in the near future.
Retirement talk also seems to follow generation-defining NBA players year-in and year-out, and not without reason.  While they might age like fine wine, guys like Tim Duncan (age 38), Dirk Nowitzki (age 36), Kevin Garnett (age 38) and,to the disdain of my fellow Los Angeles natives, Kobe Bryant (age 36), don’t have many years left for the court. While all four have at least one NBA Championship and MVP award on their résumés, all four have continually seen decreasing playing time over the past few years, not infrequently due to injury concerns.
Bryant, in particular, faces questions about how much longer he’ll be suiting up for the Lakers after tearing his Achilles tendon two years ago and only playing in six games last season.
Age has even come to haunt American soccer – MLS and U.S. Men’s National Team icon Landon Donovan, who accrued three MLS Cups, multiple MLS single-season scoring records and a plethora of appearances for the U.S. in three World Cups.
He missed the final cut for the United States’ 2014 World Cup team this past summer and not long afterward, the 32-year-old Donovan announced that this season will be his last on the pitch.
Jeter. Manning. Duncan. Nowitzki. Garnett. Bryant. Donovan. Those seven guys alone combine for over 20 championships and countless records between the four respective American sports leagues. Professional sports is reaching the end of an era, most heavily indicated thus far by Jeter’s last season.
While it’s of course not the first time such a shift in the landscape of professional sports has ever taken place, but for some such as myself, this will be the first era we’ll have seen from virtually start to finish.
In lines of work where one’s considered “over-the-hill” at 30 years old, there’s no logical reason to expect our favorite athletes to play forever.
Bryant and Duncan alone sound like the result of some bizarre alternate timeline a la the Back to the Future films. These guys are in reality slowly fading from the picture, but they’re not gone yet.
Just like with Jeter, appreciate and enjoy the greatness that remains of the ‘90s era while it’s still here.
Watch in awe at the passing spectacles Manning continues to deliver on the gridiron. Applaud Bryant’s comeback as he chases both the NBA all-time points record and an elusive sixth championship ring, as bleak as that last part may look.
Try not to cry (then cry a lot) during Donovan’s final game for the red, white and blue on October 10 in Team USA’s friendly versus Ecuador.
Before they are relegated to books or Internet archives, enjoy these lasting relics of an aged sports world. For as Derek Jeter revealed in his final moment of grandeur last week, in sports, there’s no time quite like the present.

When the news broke that the USC had found their new head football coach in Steve Sarkisian, the reaction across campus and from the Trojan faithful was underwhelming to say the least.
USC fans hope that head coach Steve Sarkisian does not follow the same trajectory as Lane Kiffin. — Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
“They fired Kiffin only to replace him with Kiffin 2.0?” asked puzzled football fans. Safe to say, the hiring of “Seven win Steve” was not an immediate hit with the Trojan faithful. On the surface, it looked like the school’s storied football program had tried to reach back into the Pete Carroll era time capsule and settled for a familiar face instead of going in a bold new direction with a splashy hire.
Yes, it’s true that Sarkisian only had a 34-29 record at Washington in five years. However, it’s important to consider the state of the UW program at the time of his arrival. Washington, in 2009, had run the table in reverse, losing every single game (a pretty difficult task in itself) prior to Sark’s arrival.
The school had lousy facilities and no recruiting inroads into California, the only consistently fertile recruiting state on the West Coast. Fast forward five years and the Huskies were one controversial call against Stanford from winning 10 games and opened up a newly renovated stadium.
More importantly, due to Sarkisian’s efforts, Washington now has significant recruiting inroads across the West Coast. One example is Shaq Thompson, a 5-star linebacker recruit, who had offers from nearly every powerhouse school in the country including USC.
Sarkisian was able to convince him to leave sunny California to go play up in the rain at Washington. Sarkisian’s recruiting prowess was further showcased this most recent spring when he locked up three 5-star recruits in Adoree’ Jackson, Damien Mama and Juju Smith on national signing day and when he flipped highly touted quarterback Ricky Town’s commitment from Alabama to USC.
For those who link Sarkisian to his predecessor, Lane Kiffin, there are a couple reasons why the comparison is unfair and invalid.
First, Sarkisian has a completely different personality. Kiffin was often seen as a cold, standoffish personality who eventually closed the media from practice. Sarkisian is a much more personable figure who is more at home with the scrutinizing Los Angeles media.
Schematically, Kiffin and Sarkisian are also different. Kiffin remained committed to the traditional, under center pro-style offense, while Sarkisian ran a hurry up pro-style offense that primarily operates out of the shotgun. The two schemes can be compared by looking at last season’s offensive rankings in which Sarkisian’s Washington team averaged 38 points a game with less talented players than did Kiffin’s USC team.
The team’s embarrassing performance against Boston College caused many Trojan football fans to question Sarkisian’s play-calling ability. Sarkisian remained too committed to running the ball even with favorable man-to-man match-ups on the outside with our talented receivers.
Post game, Sarkisian acknowledged that sometimes he can be stubborn about running the ball, and that he may have to use the pass to set up the run instead of the other way around.
Following the bye week, Sarkisian’s ability to learn from earlier mistakes was showcased as USC dominated Oregon State with a solid mix of the run and pass.
Given Sarkisian’s track record at Washington, where he consistently won seven to eight games a year at a limited college football program, don’t you think Sark can win a few more games a year at USC? With Sarkisian’s ability to relate to and recruit young players, as well as his willingness to learn from previous mistakes, he can bring USC back to its status as national championship Contenders within the next few years.
I see the Pete Carroll phenomenon as akin to boy-bands. Pete Carroll is like Justin Timberlake, the only relevant and hugely successful one from In-Sync, whereas Sark and Kiffin fade out of the limelight. I don’t know the logic behind it, but O-coordinators under highly successful coaches do not translate into national titles.
…But I hope I’m wrong about Sark. Go Coach Sark!
Wow…Pump the brakes a little buddy. A national championship is more than a few years out. Only a fanbase as delusional as USC(maybe ND too) can get blown up by Boston College and still have an article about national championship aspirations.
