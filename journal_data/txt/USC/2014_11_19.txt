Big Boi and Phantogram will be the headliners of USC’s annual Conquest festival tonight, held to rally students before the UCLA rivalry football game this upcoming Saturday.
Conquest!: The Ultimate Trojan Experience is a yearly event hosted by USC Concerts Committee, Office of Campus Activities, Undergraduate Student Government Program Board and Trojan Pride. It will be held on McCarthy Quad and give students the opportunity to come together and show their Trojan pride. Conquest will celebrate accomplishments in USC athletics and academics.
This is the 11th annual Conquest rally.
“The purpose [of the event] is to celebrate and capture the incredible pride on display during Troy Week and bring the student body together to rally around the team and school before the cross-town rivalry game,” said Abigail Harris, the assistant director of Concerts Committee.
The event will open with a food truck fair and sponsor booths at 5 p.m. Food trucks at the event will include Kogi, The Lime Truck, Waffles de Liege, Coolhaus, The Grilled Cheese Truck and The Boba Truck.
There will be a rally at 7 p.m. with appearances from USC sports teams and coaches, the Trojan Marching Band and the USC Song Girls. USC performance groups scheduled to perform are the hip-hop dance crew C3, a capella groups Troy Tones and Underscore and Competition Cheer.
There will also be returning traditions such as the Ferris wheel that lights up cardinal and gold, a Bruin bonfire, a fireworks show and a concert.
This year’s headliners have collaborated before.
Big Boi is a six-time GRAMMY Award winner and has sold more than 25 million albums worldwide as half of the musical group OutKast. Outside of OutKast, he is also a successful songwriter and record producer.
The other headliner, electronic rock duo Phantogram, made SPIN’s list of the 50 Best Albums of 2014, has played at many major American music festivals, and has had songs featured in movies such as The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and TV shows such as Skins, Teen Wolf and Shameless. The band has previously performed with Big Boi on three songs from his second studio album.
“We decided on [this] lineup because we wanted to do something truly special and thought bringing Big Boi and Phantogram was the perfect way to achieve that goal, as they’re both highly acclaimed performers, bring very different audiences together and are working on a joint EP,” Harris said.
Previous Conquest! concert headliners have included Jason Derulo, Childish Gambino and Cobra Starship.
Typically around 5,000 students attend throughout the course of the night, according to Concerts Committee.
Conquest! is a closed show for USC students, alumni and community members. USC students must show their USC IDs, and guests must show proper government-issued ID to enter McCarthy Quad.

A report released by the Council of Graduate Schools on Nov. 12 shows that the United States continues to be a popular destination for international graduate students. USC’s population of international students reflects this trend as the university remains a top choice for students from abroad.
On the rise · Last year, USC received 10,600 applications for graduate study from Chinese international students, accounting for 25% of the total. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The data shows higher numbers of international graduate students despite the increase in competition that has resulted from foreign nations developing graduate programs. Larger numbers of students from other countries have also made up for a decline in Chinese graduate students.
According to the report, the number of international students at U.S. graduate programs in the past five years has risen from 7 to 10 percent; in addition, the total international graduate enrollment increased by 8 percent between fall 2013 and fall 2014, which means that approximately 17 percent of all graduate students in U.S. graduate programs are from other countries.
The new data indicates that India has surpassed China in number of graduate students sent to U.S. schools. This was the first time in over a decade that the number of Chinese students enrolling in U.S. graduate programs decreased by a total of 1 percent.
Though the 1 percent decrease in the number of Chinese graduate student enrollment might seem marginal, the number is significant, as students from China make up 33 percent of the total number of international students enrolling in U.S. graduate programs.
Over the past few years, China has made a conscious effort to improve the standards of its own graduate schools, which has given many Chinese students an opportunity to receive a high-quality education from programs offered domestically. Though nationally U.S. graduate schools are experiencing the decline in applicants from China, USC has actually received an increase in applications from Chinese students.
“Last year, USC received a record number of graduate applications,” USC Dean of Admissions Timothy Brunold said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “International applications made up 52 percent of last year’s total graduate application pool.”
This news comes after a report released on Sunday showed that USC is now the number two destination for students from abroad, behind New York University, after 13 years of having the highest international student enrollment of any U.S. university.
USC received a total of 10,600 graduate applications from Chinese international students, making up 48 percent of the university’s international graduate applications and 25 percent of its total graduate applications.
Data for this year is not yet available. It remains to be seen what role safety concerns may play in international student interest following the killings of three Chinese international graduate students at USC in the past two years.
The steady increase in international students annually by USC, specifically international students from China, can be attributed to a variety of things including extensive recruitment programs, well-regarded graduate academic programs and the university’s reputation for being home to a large international student body.
USC has also taken many measures aimed at continuing to attract international students to its campuses, including being receptive to international student issues.
This year, Vice President of Graduate Student Government Joanie Evans established the International Student Concerns Committee. Evans decided to start the committee in response to recent concerns over the safety of international students on campus.
“We are trying to figure out what factors led to students not knowing how to navigate the neighborhood [around USC’s campus] safely,” Evans said.
Some of the measures the committee and Graduate Student Government has taken include events and programs to help integrate international graduate students into the campus community. Evans and her committee also met with the creator of the new Trojan Mobile Safety app to voice specific concerns held by international students.
“The students there had an opportunity to preview the app, offer him feedback — so he got direct feedback from international students about ways to improve the app to make it better,” Evans said.
Though it is too early to project the international graduate application numbers for the coming academic year, Brunold expects more increases.
“Every indication is that we are on our way to another record year,” he wrote in an email.
Putting aside headcounts, being an international student isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language. Assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that helps anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they contributed to our society, including students.
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work for an American firm here or overseas.
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here.
   Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow
students, and books like this to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.  Good luck to all wherever you study!

In a vote last Friday, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously supported the call for a resolution that would include South Los Angeles in the city’s federal Promise Zone, a program that could qualify the district for millions of dollars in infrastructure improvements.
Zoned out · The Price School of Public Policy evaluated the needs of the districts that were selected in the first round as well as South Los Angeles. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
Los Angeles was one of five cities across the United States selected for the program. The designated districts chosen from the first round included Hollywood, MacArthur Park and Koreatown.
“The first round had a series of grant requirements to be eligible to apply that no organization in South L.A. had received at the time,” said Connie Llanos, communications director and strategic advisor for Council District Nine. “This time around, the government has lifted this requirement.”
The Promise Zone designation would give South Los Angeles preferential status to collect federal grants.
“We have been organizing community partners to make sure we put in a strong application in this highly competitive process,” Llanos said. “We garner support from elected officials on local, state and even federal levels.”
Introduced by Obama’s State of the Union Address last year, the Promise Zone Initiative aims to form partnerships between cities and their local communities and businesses with the goal of bolstering the middle class through providing more educational opportunities, improving public safety and making affordable housing more accessible.
“The needs of South Los Angeles are undeniable,” Llanos said. “It has a poverty rate of 46 percent, which is three times that of the nation and almost double the city of Los Angeles. Beyond that, crime rates and unemployment are well above the national average, and the school dropout rate is still chronically high.”
The Price School of Public Policy has played a role in assessing the needs of the districts selected in the first round as well as the needs of South Los Angeles, with the hopes that it will be included with the second wave of selections.
“Our promise is to help the Promise Zone with their evaluation efforts and to develop a framework to help them create measureable progress within the zone,” said Gary Dean Painter, professor and director of graduate programs in public policy. “This involves meeting with community stakeholders and extending measurements to South L.A.”
Regardless of Promise Zone status, though, the Price School aims to measure community vitality across the county, focusing on places of need like South Los Angeles in addition to the selected districts.
“We want to do an evaluation of the first Promise Zone and the hopeful second promise zone,” Painter said. “We use categories of indicators such as economic, educational, housing, public health and safety to analyze how things are doing. While we start with communities of need like South L.A., our effort is to extend the set of indicators to, ultimately, the whole county.”
Llanos has high hopes for South Los Angeles in the upcoming application process, which has a nationwide deadline this Friday.
“The need itself, coupled with some real promise by local organizations really creates a perfect narrative for why South Los Angeles should be included in the city’s Promise Zone,” she said.
The impending resolution is now in the hands of Mayor Eric Garcetti. The Obama administration will not make decisions about the second round of selections until next year.
“We think with the collection of voices, in addition to securing the mayor’s support, we can effectively campaign for this designation,” Llanos said.

The Alumni Association is launching a new initiative that will aim to provide alumni with specific professional networks in careers that graduates pursue rather than their area of study.
Each network will be led by a council of five to seven alums in the specific industry who will be in charge of working with the Alumni Association to work out the plans and goals of each network. As of now, there is an entertainment and veterans network, with plans for education and real estate networks underway.
Alumni have suggested that USC, which often prides itself on the strength of Trojan Family alumni network, should strengthen its networking after college.
“These changes go to enhance, rather than replace, the existing alumni networks,” said Charlene Fravien, director of alumni affinity and student outreach programs. “Typically, alums connect through the region in which they live or the school they studied under, but with the addition of these new communities, our alumni can connect through what they do -— their passions.”
Through an array of alumni networks, there are several ways that graduates can give to the university and receive support as well. Alumni can stay connected through U.S. regional and international clubs, as well as the popular campus-based groups. These groups are divided by school and serve the needs of alumni who graduated from specific schools under the university. Campus-based groups aim to maintain the connection between students who pursued studies in similar areas and keep them updated on the latest in the school. Additionally, campus-based group members have access to their school’s alumni services and benefits, which often include the school’s career development office.
The Trojan Entertainment Network (TEN) was the first of these new skills-based groups to develop last spring. Graduates who worked in entertainment approached the Alumni Association to suggest the formation of a new industry-specific network, since they allow for a mix of professional and social networking within the realm of a specific field. At the same time, members of TEN have also managed to maintain a strong connection to their former USC classmates and the university as a whole.
According to Fravien, the four areas of entertainment, veterans, education and real estate networks were the first to receive special attention because they are fields that are most in need of stronger connections. Many alums end up working in one of the four areas where these new networks are being added, but many did not go to school looking to specialize in the industry. There are plenty of students who work in entertainment, but did not study in the School of Cinematic Arts, for example.
“This is especially true for the veterans community at USC. There is a lot of affinity between veteran students and alumni, but there was never a network to bridge this community together,” Fravien said.
An event was held for the launch of the veterans network last Wednesday, which included a ribbon cutting ceremony to officially unveil the university’s new Veteran Resource Center. Veteran students and alumni mingled and shared personal stories and goals. Alumni also received private campus tours, an effort to keep them updated on everything new and changing at USC.
According to Nathaniel Hsieh, president of Society 53, the official student ambassador program of the Alumni Association, these new field-specific networks will function similarly to the existing campus-based groups.
Like the campus-based groups that are offered through schools on campus, these groups will notify alumni of upcoming events, career opportunities and ways to give back to the school.
“The purpose of these groups is to really maximize the Trojan Family network and connections,” Hsieh said.
This is especially true in the way the new networks make for more cross programming among alumni relations. For example, a Trojan Entertainment Network event might take place in New York City, which would make way for interactions between alums who are active in the New York regional group. This cross-programming allows members of TEN to meet other individuals in the same industry and region, while strengthening ties to USC simultaneously.
According to Fravien, over half of graduates who attended launch events for these newly formed networks were new to alumni events as a whole, proving their early-stage success and relevance among Trojan alums.
As of now, only two of the four proposed networks are officially active. By spring of this year, the Alumni Association hopes to put together the advising and leadership councils for both the education and real estate networks and receive an official charter of recognition by the university over the summer.

USC awarded the Los Angeles Police Department Cadet Leadership Program a $100,000 grant at an outdoor ceremony on Wednesday morning.
In training · Candidates for the Los Angeles Police Department Cadet Leadership Program must be between ages 13 and 20, have high scholastic achievement and good moral character. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The LAPD Cadets is a youth outreach program designed to enrich the lives of L.A. youth and teach them good character and leadership skills. The Cadet Leadership Program is offered at all 21 community police stations throughout Los Angeles as well as a few specialty programs such as the metropolitan and communications divisions.
President C.L. Max Nikias made the opening remarks introducing LAPD First Assistant Chief Earl Paysinger on a stage standing next to lines of the cadets in their light blue uniforms.
“The USC community is happy to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with such an amazing leader,” Nikias said of Paysinger.
Paysinger, the author of the department’s “Youth First” campaign, describes the program as “[their] department’s signature community outreach initiative.”
“It’s not about cultivating police officers,” Paysinger said. “It’s about cultivating young people and providing them the tools to be whatever they want to be.”
In order to be eligible for the program, cadets must be between the ages of 13 and 20, have high scholastic achievement and demonstrate good moral character.
With the increase in funding in recent years, the cadet classes have been able to grow, with this year’s graduating class being the largest in history at approximately 750 cadets.
“With this grant, we can continue to hold to our pledge to allow our cadets to participate and learn free of charge,” Paysinger said.
Following Paysinger’s remarks, Laura Mendoza, student leader of the LAPD cadets, took to the podium.
Mendoza, who joined the cadets in 2010, recalled being surrounded by drugs, gangs and violence prior to being enrolled in the program.
“That reality didn’t have to become my future,” she said.
Mendoza described herself at the beginning of the program as being shy, secluded and having trouble speaking publicly.
“I wasn’t getting a lot of support at home,” Mendoza said. “But I met a lot of cadets and officers who said ‘we believe in you, you can do whatever you want.’”
With this in mind, Mendoza set her sights on becoming the student leader of the cadets and, with the help of her officers and fellow cadets, achieved this goal.
“The cadet program will motivate others and tell them that anything is possible,” Mendoza said.
The graduation ceremony for this year’s class of cadets will be held at the Galen Center this Saturday. The cadets also received a tour of campus following the ceremony.
“We hope one day to welcome many of [the cadets] back to USC as our students,” said Nikias. “USC stands with them not just today, but for many years in the future.”
Nikias pledged to continue his support of the program.
“These cadets are our future,” Nikias said. “Look at them; they are America’s future.”

If you know anything about Jaden Smith, it’s probably through his active Twitter account or his role in the film Pursuit of Happyness alongside his father Will. Though he has acted in a few movies, Smith seems to be following his father’s other career aspirations, as the young movie star has been steadily releasing music for the last few weeks, culminating in a new mixtape released Monday entitled Cool Tape Volume 2. Though Smith has a lot to learn about presentation and self-image, he has a lot of talent, and — ego aside — his newest album is both clean and technically superior to anything expected of a 16-year-old boy.

In a joint interview with The New York Times this week, Smith and his sister Willow seemed incredibly arrogant, speaking on topics clearly beyond their years instead of their music. How could anyone take these two teenagers seriously after they attempt to talk about “quantum physics” and “[ancient texts] that can’t be pre-dated”? While I’m sure these two are just trying to make waves to get exposure, there are much smarter ways to do so without alienating every writer, teacher and musician with statements like, “There’re no novels that I like to read so I write my own novels, and then I read them again, and it’s the best thing,” or, “You never learn anything in school. Think about how many car accidents happen every day. Driver’s ed? What’s up? I still haven’t been to driver’s ed because if everybody I know has been in an accident, I can’t see how driver’s ed is really helping them out.”
Smith’s marketing campaign extends into his personal life as well, as his group of friends is a mix of B-team all-stars, some notoriously arrogant, that all have contributed to his work in some way. His close friend Kylie Jenner has promoted his work since the young rapper began putting out music, and she starred in his first music video for a track titled “Blue Ocean,” which happened to be directed by friend Moises Arias (Rico from Hannah Montana). Also on his team is Moises’s brother Mateo, or Teo in Smith’s lyrics, who seemingly produced some, if not all, of the tracks on Cool Tape Volume 2. With all these half-famous stars on his team, Jaden has attracted a lot of attention relatively quickly, signaling that he is trying to leave the acting world behind in pursuit of a real hip-hop career.
Self-image aside, Smith has been releasing music on an almost daily basis for over a month now, and most of it is really quite good. His first few releases on his sister’s or friend Teo’s Soundcloud accounts were clearly just experimentation with genres, as he ran through every style of hip-hop from slow R&B to spaghetti western-inspired tracks, but his album has a voice, and it is clear that he has recently spent a lot of time refining his style.
His beats are reminiscent of old school hip-hop, but his flow is modern, employing many stylistic aspects used by artists like Chance the Rapper and Childish Gambino. Staccato pauses and real-world atmospheric sounds highlight the postmodern style that is currently trending in hip-hop today, and Jaden clearly tapped into this new genre of hip-hop while crafting this album. He must have picked up many of his ideas on composition while working on Gambino’s most recent EP Kauai, as Jaden’s offbeat flow and lyrical creativity align with that of Gambino.
The content of this album focuses mainly on love affairs that never seem to pan out, which sometimes feels uncomfortable when considering the female vocals on the album are all provided by sister Willow. Smith references J.D. Salinger’s epitome of teen angst The Catcher in the Rye many times, comparing himself to Holden Caulfield, as expected of an angsty teen thrust into the spotlight too early. For all his ego outside the music, Smith is refreshingly honest in his work. It is clear that he is trying not to act his age, but his natural angst provides a solid foundation for creating relatable tracks about young love. There is a lot of California culture in Cool Tape Volume 2, making reference to PCH and other staples of beach life that contribute to a lighter vibe for the album overall. These two topics combine beautifully to create a confusion between happiness and depression that is both hard to describe and wholly familiar.
Smith has a lot of growing to do before he can be taken seriously as a mainstream artist, but his music certainly surpasses expectations and will be on my personal playlists for at least a week. With a compositional style all his own and lyrics beyond his years, Smith has, if nothing else, put his name on the watch list of every major music blog, and I can’t wait to hear what he creates next. But that’s not really what Smith cares about, as noted on his infamous Twitter account:
“People Use To Ask Me What Do You Wanna Be When You Get Older And I Would Say What A Stupid Question The Real Question Is What Am I Right Now.”

The biggest annoyance in singer-songwriter Mat Kearney’s life right now is the drilling coming from the elementary school being built across the street from his Nashville, Tennessee home that’s been interrupting his recording schedule.
“But it’s for kids, so you can’t really hate them. Maybe really deep in my soul,” said the easygoing singer-songwriter, laughing. Kearney’s casual, positive demeanor is just like his sound: upbeat and sonically pleasing.

Comparable to Train or Jason Mraz, Kearney’s music has been well received throughout his nine years as a major label recording artist. Armed with the ever-present hat he calls his “Superman cape,” Kearney has cracked the Billboard Top 40 with top 20-hits five times over the years. A seasoned veteran with an unusually constant career, Kearney plans to take his music in a totally different, beat-driven direction with his upcoming album, Just Kids, which he hopes will surprise people on first listen.
A preview of this new sound, the single “Heartbeat” released on Nov. 3, pulls inspiration from dance-driven beats of the ’90s backing a simple, clear tune.
“Sometimes it’s fun to write a simple love song,” Kearney said. “Heartbeat” came as a surprise to the artist, written sleepily after he had just played a show. The last song written for the upcoming record, ”Heartbeat” is a personal favorite of Kearney’s and a good indication of what’s to come.
“Textures of the ’80s and ’90s are at the core of the record, and a lot of it is beat-driven with a hip hop influence,” he said.
Kearney felt he segued in this new direction with his previous work as well. His 2011 hit single ”Ships in the Night” pulls a strong beat and spoken word sound from hip-hop influences. Kearney describes the overall sound of Just Kids as what it might sound like if Paul Simon and Kanye West made a record together.
“Every album is a gateway into the next one. ‘Ships in the Night’ was a really special song. Creatively, it really spoke to me and continued to speak to me,” he said.
Despite the potential dissonance created by melding peppy ’70s folk singer Simon and aggressive, bold rapper West, the idea strikes a strong inspirational chord with Kearney. He thinks many singer-songwriters are writing for a time that has passed, with a nostalgic tone, and wants to be in the present musical scene.
“Hip-hop is people talking about today. This is happening right now, and that’s super inspiring to me,” he said. “Hip-hop today is the modern day folk.”
Incorporating a spoken word style of delivery into his music has allowed Kearney to combine storytelling from his songwriting background with the vibe of modern songs, citing Kendrick Lamar and Drake as inspirations.
This mashup mentality is also present in his latest music video for the song “Heartbeat,” which has been getting buzz for its technique: it’s filmed in a single take by a drone over the L.A. River. Though viewers wouldn’t expect Grease-style dancing and pastel happiness from a traditionally acoustic and mellow artist, both are present in the pleasant video.
Kearney seems to be intent on doing the unexpected in order to break out of the mold of the singer-songwriter that he has so comfortably held for many years.
Kearney further distinguishes himself from the pack with his take on streaming services amid the Spotify controversy brought into the public eye by Taylor Swift. Swift made waves in the music world in the last few weeks by first keeping her newest album off the popular streaming service and then pulling her entire discography from Spotify.
Jokingly, Kearney posted an photo on Instagram a week ago with the caption: “Hanging at @spotify today! #feelingthelove #nyc #sorrytaylor #sorrynotsorry.”
He is quick to clear the record as to his thoughts on Swift as an artist and friend.
“I love Taylor [Swift], and she’s been super supportive of me,” he said. “For me, it’s different than if you’re the biggest artist in the world.”
Kearney lists Spotify as a huge aid in his career by helping get the word out about his music and build a loyal fanbase that follows his work and attends his shows. He attributes his financial stability to writing and touring rather than pure record sales, and Spotify has helped build his reputation. Around the time of the release of his 2011 album Young Love, Kearney said that interest in the album on the streaming service was second only to the Jay-Z and Kanye West collaboration album Watch the Throne.
This level of success is unexpected, and the affable singer said he feels incredibly lucky to continue to produce and pursue music. The awe he feels is reflected in Just Kids, which pulls inspiration from the formative years of middle school and high school, when “you just did what you loved.”
Kearney advises young artists looking to make a marketable and sustainable career out of music to not only find their own voice, but also be self-sustaining in terms of musical programs such as GarageBand or Logic. Kearney said he recorded and mixed half of the upcoming record himself on his laptop, while on the road.
“A beautiful renaissance we’re seeing in music is kids making music in their bedrooms,” he said.
Kearney emphasizes having a hand in the full production of any work, as he did with Just Kids, which he says just might be his best album to date.
“At the end of the day, if you can make a record that your friends want to play for their friends, that’s success.”

Ivory Tower, a documentary directed and produced by Emmy-nominated filmmakers Andrew Rossi and Kate Novack, examines a question that is hauntingly relevant to college students: is the value of a university education worth the cost? The documentary, which will air on CNN on Nov. 20 at 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. exposes both the alarming statistics concerning student debt and the problematic issues surrounding the idea of a relatively cheap (or even free) education.
Covering all the bases · Ivory Tower presents the mind-boggling numbers associated with student debt in the country today. It also shows the stories of those who have pursued alternative paths for post-secondary experiences. The draws from both ends of the college debate. – Photo courtesy of CNN
On one hand, Ivory Tower makes a point of challenging the viewer to think outside of the box of a standard, expensive college education. The film details sobering facts, such as the facts that the national student loan debt surpasses $1 trillion and that the price of college has increased more than any other good or service, such as food or healthcare, since 1973. To complement these statistics, interviews with educational authors and professors discuss the issue of whether a student’s tuition is actually connected to his or her quality of education. The film mulls over issues of the higher education arms race for prestige, and how that race for better facilities and high-profile faculty financially impacts student tuition. In an interview, Anya Kamenetz, author of DIY U: Edupunks, Edupreneurs, and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education, states that college is a mysterious “black box” and that “we’ve never examined, closely, the ingredients of the box.” With these formidable statistics and a discussion concerning the actual destination of an individual’s tuition, Ivory Tower urgently prods the viewer to examine those ingredients.
The documentary also follows the stories of those who dare to step away from a standard post-high school experience. For example, a couple scenes focus on the Thiel Fellowship, which essentially pays its fellows $100,000 to drop out of college, live at an Education Hackerhouse in Silicon Valley and work on their own start-ups with mentors. This choice is labeled as “hacking one’s education.” The documentary takes a fairly neutral stance on this anomalistic situation, choosing to include both zealous statements by the Thiel Fellowship mentors, who state that a college education is simply an overpriced “mythical large bundle of things” and a tempering statement by the president of Georgetown University, who points out that the prodigies who are successful without a college degree, are the “exceptions to the rule” — that “the safest bet” is to invest in a college education. The film also notes that median lifetime earnings with a high school diploma are about $1,304,000, while a bachelor’s degree would produce about $2,268,000.
Ivory Tower continues this balanced style of narration by contrasting shocking financial statistics with the grim reality of the alternative to a costly college education. The documentary follows the story of Cooper Union, a college that had a mission of providing free tuition for every student up until last year. Ivory Tower follows the rousing quest of protesting students who occupied the university president’s office, insisting education, as a human right, ought to be free. Despite this, interviews with the president of Cooper Union expose the practical, unavoidable problem of making education free — or, at the very least, cheaper — when constructing a new university building costs more than a luxury hotel.
The documentary also follows the stories of start-up companies that provide free online courses, which are recorded from world-class universities such as Stanford. Though these courses drastically reduce the cost of attending a university, the results that Ivory Tower presents are acutely disappointing — one university that tried such an online program ended up with a 50.5 percent pass rate, with only a 25.4 percent pass rate at college algebra.
Ivory Tower does initially criticize America’s higher education with statistics and interviews, but it also refuses to idealize the alternatives to a costly four-year education. In fact, its exposure of the issues surrounding recent attempts to provide free education is equally biting. At one point, the film documents a speaker at Cooper Union who points out the debate about whether education should be free or not doesn’t actually exist: the real issue at hand is who is willing to pay for education. This question is the backbone of Ivory Tower’s themes: if education’s cost is to be alleviated, who else is going to pay for it, and how can quality and prestige be sustained?
At times, Ivory Tower undermines its own attempt to maintain a neutral tone: the statistics spliced into the documentary rarely come with a citation of a specific study, and in order to emphasize a certain point, the narrative focus of the documentary hones in on overwrought statistics and case studies. For example, the film quotes a study that found that its population studied “less than five hours per week” while attempting to describe the potential uselessness of a college degree. Though procrastination and unproductivity aren’t alien phenomena for the standard college student, such a statistic might sound more outlandish than widely representative. Such melodramatic moments in the documentary impair the diplomatic shifts between opposed viewpoints — the frank balance that is supposed to make Ivory Tower interesting and compelling.
Overall, however, Ivory Tower is a refreshingly fair look at the issue of college costs. On one hand, it details the absurd cost of college and dares the viewer to closely inspect the expensive product he or she is purchasing. It notes the alternatives beyond society’s pre-packaged answer of a four-year education. Ivory Tower, however, simultaneously refuses to be shy about the flaws embedded in such alternatives, and the painful necessity of a college diploma for the majority of future members of the work force. Just as the interviewed authors and professors repeatedly emphasizes that a college environment should be democratic, the film provides the viewer with several perspectives on the cost of college and leaves its conclusion undefined.

For the better part of three months, I never thought senior cornerback Josh Shaw would return to the USC football team.
Once Shaw revealed that he leapt from his own third-story balcony to evade police — and that those police officers were responding to a potential domestic violence incident — I thought he was done. Even if he hadn’t physically harmed his longtime girlfriend, as he claimed, there was no way USC wanted to endure the media circus that reinstating Shaw would surely cause. Considering the NFL’s recent history with domestic violence, it was a long shot that Shaw would ever suit up again.
Then came Monday. The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office declined to press criminal charges, and the possibility of Shaw’s return to Troy gained steam. In the eyes of the law, he had done nothing wrong, meaning that his 10-game suspension could essentially be attributed to one lie. A big lie, to be sure. But just a lie.
Pundits and fans argued that 10 games was long enough. Continuing a player’s suspension after he had been cleared of any wrongdoing made no sense. The university agreed, lifting Shaw’s suspension on Tuesday afternoon. In the end, it was a predictable development. The decision was probably the right one, and I’m not going to criticize it. A lot of smart people — in law enforcement and at USC —  spent hours investigating the incident and came to the conclusion that Josh Shaw is not a criminal.
With that out of the way, I can finally throw my hat in the ring and deliver my #JoshShaw hot take: Shaw might not be a criminal, but he is a damn good football player who can give the Trojans a shot to win the Pac-12.
O.K., back up. A lot of dominoes need to fall in just the right order for that to happen, so let’s be more realistic: #JoshShaw can help USC beat UCLA on Saturday night.
Unfortunately, it’s no big secret that the Trojans’ secondary has been remarkably inconsistent this season. At its best, the unit held Oregon State’s Sean Mannion — a future pro — to 123 yards on 15-of-32 passing. At its worst? Arizona State’s Mike Bercovici had 600 yards and four touchdowns in his entire career before playing USC on Oct. 4. He proceeded to torch the Trojans for 510 yards and five scores in one night.
As usual, statistics — however gaudy — don’t tell the whole story. To figure out where and when USC’s secondary has failed, and where Shaw can help, a closer look is necessary.
As painful as it is to remember, USC led ASU 27-18 late in the fourth quarter. To that point the Sun Devils’ potent attack had been frustrated, both by a series of long drives from the Trojans’ offense and a valiant effort from the USC defense.
Unfortunately, with just under four minutes left to play, everything unraveled. First came a 21-yard touchdown strike from Bercovici to running back D.J. Foster. ASU lined up with three receivers to Bercovici’s right on the play, the versatile Foster being the closest to the quarterback. USC’s nickel defense consisted of five defensive backs, a cornerback assigned to each of the Sun Devils’ three primary receivers and two deep safeties. This left senior linebacker Hayes Pullard in charge of Foster in the flat, with senior safety Gerald Bowman helping on deeper routes. Foster left Pullard in the dust and streaked to the endzone, and Bowman was far too slow in reading the play — leading to the easy touchdown.
With sophomore Su’a Cravens — who rarely played in nickel situations — officially moving to outside linebacker, safety play has been as issue for the Trojans this season. Freshman John Plattenburg is challenging Bowman and sophomore Leon McQuay III for a starting spot, a late-season position battle that could shake the confidence of all three players. Shaw, who saw action at safety in 2012 and 2013, could have shifted back to that role this season when needed.
Freshman Adoree’ Jackson’s emergence aside, USC has also struggled at cornerback. After the Trojans extended their lead over the Sun Devils to 34-25, Bercovici immediately found wideout Cameron Smith for a 73-yard touchdown. Smith beat junior cornerback Kevon Seymour to the sideline on the play, an excusable — if untimely — error. But Seymour compounded his mistake by diving for an interception instead of continuing his pursuit, allowing Smith to break free for the score. This is the type of result that Shaw, even by his presence alone, could have altered. Who knows what type of leadership and advice the senior captain could have a brought to his teammates in a late-game situation. I won’t say USC would’ve won the game with Shaw on the field, but the secondary would’ve been a lot calmer and smarter.
Funny enough, the fourth quarter tends to be where the Trojans’ secondary falls apart in tough games. Just a week after giving up 239 yards and three touchdowns to Bercovici in only three drives, the unit allowed Arizona gunslinger Anu Solomon to put up a 16-of-29, 177 yard, one touchdown fourth-quarter stat line. Utah’s Travis Wilson — who remains the Pac-12’s second-worst starting quarterback in terms of yards and completion percentage — went 5-of-9 for 46 yards and a game-winning touchdown in his team’s final possession against USC. Even in last week’s 38-30 win over Cal, Bears quarterback Jared Goff threw for 113 yards and two scores in the final frame after scrapping for just one touchdown over the game’s first three quarters.
Though this is a trend that USC cannot afford to continue, it’s also one that Shaw’s mere presence could affect. The Trojans’ front seven looked lost without team captain Pullard in the lineup for the first half of the Boston College matchup, and the secondary has looked similarly lost late in certain games. If head coach Steve Sarkisian and defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox are looking for a solution to this problem, plugging in Shaw is the way to go.

Seven goals for the USC men’s water polo team last weekend clinched a victory over Cal in dramatic fashion to end the regular season, and when the postseason begins tomorrow, seven will once again be the magic number for the Trojans (21-4, 6-2 MPSF). With six straight NCAA championships under their belt, the Trojans’ path to lucky number seven begins tomorrow against UC Irvine, as they’ll first have to go through the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament in order to claim a spot in the NCAA tournament.
Goalasaurus · Senior driver Rex Butler is USC’s second-leading goalscorer this season with 39. Butler also has 11 multi-goal games. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
“All I’ve got to say is that we’ve got to win all the games [at the MPSF tournament] to secure a spot in the NCAAs,” senior driver Kostas Genidounias told the Pac-12 Network after the Nov. 15 game against Cal. “We [have to] keep playing like this — for the past two weeks, we’ve been playing excellent defense, and we [have to] bring that to the tournament. The goals are coming. We’re a good offensive team. We need our freshmen to step up, not only our seniors, and I think we’re going to have a good postseason.”
The No. 3 Trojans edged out No. 5 Cal 7-6 on their Senior Day and regular season finale at Uytengsu Aquatic Center. Following the team’s three-game win streak to finish the regular season, and with the stakes now set at “win or go home,” Trojan head coach Jovan Vavic has no doubt his team can rise to the occasion in the playoffs.
“I really like the way we’ve been playing in tough matches when our back is next to the wall,” Vavic said. “We had to play well against Cal. We did. We had to play well against Long Beach State [on Nov. 8], in Long Beach. We did. Every time we have been challenged, we have really responded well.”
The 2014 iteration of the Trojan water polo team is younger and less experienced than the championship teams of years past. More than half of the USC team is made up of underclassmen, many of them freshmen entering their first postseason as Trojans.
USC will look to senior drivers Genidounias and Rex Butler for both scoring and experience. Genidounias leads the team in scoring with 70 goals on the year and remains five goals away from the Trojan all-time career scoring record, Butler is the team’s second top scorer with 39 goals on the year and both played on the past three championship-winning squads.
When it comes to competing in the postseason, the veteran Butler’s advice for his freshman teammates was to keep calm and confident.
“You don’t need to add any extra pressure on yourself, because then you’re just going to freeze up out there,” Butler said. “I think they just think [the freshmen] need to stay confident in what they’ve been doing and just approach it like any other game.”
Along with his two leading seniors, however, Vavic noted how certain unsung heroes have bolstered the team in big games leading up to the playoffs.
“Some of our players are stepping up and each game somebody else is stepping up,” Vavic said. “Last game [senior driver] Marc Vonderweidt had his best game of the season, at the SoCal tournament it was [sophomore driver] Nick Bell, against Long Beach it was [freshman driver] Matteo Morelli. We know that Kostas [Genidounias] is going to be the backbone of our team, we know that Rex [Butler] is going to do his job. But every game it seems like someone else is having a great game, and that’s extremely encouraging.”
Friday’s MPSF tournament game against Irvine will be the second time in the past three weeks the two sides have met, with the Trojans having defeated the Anteaters 14-10 on Nov. 9. The 21-4 Trojans, however, will not want to overlook the 15-11 Anteaters in Friday’s game — Irvine boasts a lethal scorer in UCLA transfer Lovre Milos, who has found the back of the cage 88 times in 2014 and whom the Trojans will do their best to shut down come Friday.
“[Defense] becomes even more important because everybody’s playing their best,” Vavic said. “It’s not a cliché. It’s really that simple — defense wins championships.”
The Trojans’ first round clash against the Anteaters will take place at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow at Long Beach. The Trojans will play in the MPSF semifinals Saturday and finals Sunday against opponents to be determined, should they survive and advance so far. Winning the conference tournament would guarantee USC a spot in next month’s NCAA tournament.

The Trojans continued to prepare for a highly anticipated matchup with crosstown rival UCLA at practice on Wednesday. USC is determined to get back on the field with a shot at the Pac-12 South crown in sight and end a two-game losing streak against the Bruins.
Fearless leader · Head coach Steve Sarkisian allowed senior defensive back Josh Shaw to practice, but did not reveal if Shaw will play in Saturday’s game against UCLA. Sarkisian went 6-1 against the Bruins as an assistant. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Welcome Back
Redshirt senior cornerback Josh Shaw was reinstated on Tuesday evening, and he was back on the practice field Wednesday morning. Shaw spent most of the practice observing his teammates and relearning the system. The Palmdale, California, native missed a total of 10 games, but looked in shape and presumably remained active during his time away from the team.
Shaw might not see the field on Saturday, but head coach Steve Sarkisian was impressed with his movement and hopes that his knowledge and experience assists the team  in the days leading up to the game.
“I thought he moved pretty fluidly. You could tell he’s been active,” Sarkisian said. “I think Josh [Shaw] brings us a veteran player with a lot of experience.”
The players were happy to see Shaw back, and they welcomed his return to Howard Jones Field. Sarkisian wanted to move on from the incident and allow Shaw to focus on football. With only two games left in his senior season, Shaw was able to spend time with his teammates and get back into the swing of things.
“What I’ve always tried to do, not just in this instance, but in all of them, is really assess the character of the individual and [whether or not] the action was out of character for him and I totally believe that with Josh,” Sarkisian said. ”I think he’s a very good person. He made a mistake, he acknowledged it, he’s been remorseful, he’s paid a severe penalty of 10 games and he’s fortunate and happy to be back.”
Though the suspension lasted for the better part of three months, Shaw’s teammates claim that they forgave him long ago and were ecstatic to see him back at practice today.
“I guess he’s been training while he hasn’t been out here because he looks exactly the same,” said junior defensive end Leonard Williams. “He’s the same guy. Josh Shaw is a great player and we’re glad to have him back.”
Sophomore linebacker Su’a Cravens agreed.
“Josh [Shaw] was a first round corner before the season started and he’s still a first round corner even 10 games later,” Cravens said. “We forgave him probably a week after we heard what happened, people make mistakes, not everybody’s perfect. Josh [Shaw] is human, that’s our brother and we’re always going to have his back.”
Focused on the Task at Hand
Shaw’s return could be viewed as a distraction leading up to the big game, but the team is keeping their sights on the game. UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley presents a unique challenge with his ability to pass and run.
“Our biggest key that we’ve been working on is just trying to keep him in the pocket, make him as much as a passing quarterback as possible because I noticed in the past two years that what he’s been able to beat us with is his rushing,” Williams said. “We just have to limit and contain him as much as possible and limit his rushing yards.”
Cravens is determined to turn around USC’s recent misfortune against their rival, and he knows that mission starts with Hundley.
“He can sit in the pocket and eat you alive and he can also beat you with his legs,” Cravens said. “He’s a great player; I feel like I’m confident in my abilities but we’ll see what happens Saturday.”
See You On Saturday
Though the game marks another chapter in a historic rivalry, the Trojans want to let their play do the talking and are not concerned with the buildup.
“They’re preparing humbly and they’re not too hyped about it even though it’s a big rivalry,” Williams said. “We’re prepared to win just like it’s any other team.”
Much of rivalry week is made from the talk that happens between the two schools. Though that is all fun and games for the fans, the players at USC are not letting it affect their preparation, and they know that the only thing that matters is the final score.
“We realize getting hyped and talking mess is not winning games,” redshirt senior linebacker Hayes Pullard said. “When you talk mess before the game the score is still 0-0, the clock is still 15 minutes. We have to block that out and just play within the lines.”

Earlier this year, before Kim Kardashian “broke the Internet,” the web was stirring with support for #BringBackOurGirls, a campaign supported by the likes of Michelle Obama to safely return a group of schoolgirls who were kidnapped by the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram. Fueled by social media activism and celebrity support, the campaign took over the airwaves and pushed to put pressure on Boko Haram to release the schoolgirls. Fast-forward to today, and not much has changed. In fact, the situation has worsened. Boko Haram seized control of Chibok, the town from which it kidnapped those 276 schoolgirls. The issue underscores a glaring problem in today’s world: hashtags aren’t enough.
Back in May when #BringBackOurGirls was in full force, it seemed as if the entire world was going to rally behind the girls and force their release. Now, six months later, there’s still no definitive word on their possible release. On Nov. 1, Reuters reported that a man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said that those girls had been “married off” to the group’s fighters.
Internet activism isn’t all misdirected. It brings issues to the limelight and draws attention to the social changes that need to be made. Yet, when it comes to the level of heightened awareness that #BringBackOurGirls was given, why hasn’t anything changed? Admittedly, there are factors and dynamics at play that are not solely in society’s control. But when Internet activism turns into a social trend that is appealing to join because everyone else is, the true nature and mission of the activism is misconstrued and lost.
The fall of Chibok is a significant failure. When Boko Haram initially stormed the village, a brief media firestorm might have temporarily shaken the terrorist group, but it is now again on the rise to gain more power and influence in Nigeria. The country’s president, Goodluck Jonathan, has failed to wield influence, and the military has fallen short. Hundreds of schoolchildren should not have to live in fear to receive an education, and those who have been kidnapped deserve more efforts to free them than the Nigerian government, military and global community are offering. The capturing of Chibok represents the growing importance of preventing Boko Haram from further establishing a stronghold in Nigeria and the consequences of allowing a terrorist organization to seize control.
The global campaign waged to emphasize the dreadful acts committed by Boko Haram was a positive step forward in informing the world of the current events in Nigeria. Now, as the fervor and passion have wavered, social activism is tasked with reviving the campaign and making it known that Boko Haram hasn’t faltered, but is in fact gaining more power. The reason Boko Haram’s capture of hundreds of schoolgirls and their town is significant is because it stands in the way of education. Just as 17-year-old Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan triumphed for education in the most courageous of acts, the 276 schoolgirls who have been kidnapped and remain hostages of Boko Haram stand as reminders of the need to fight terrorism with methods that not only spread awareness, but also make a real impact. It’s a tall order to initiate tangible change in social and Internet activism, but it’s up to supporters of the school children to make it known to the world what is going on. #BringBackOurGirls.

I’ve got a novel idea. Let’s do nothing. Let the Muslims deal with their own
problems for a change. Let’s let countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait
with their endless ocean of money and Western-bought armaments figure it out
instead. Surely they – being practitioners of the religion of compassion and
peace – will step right up to the plate in our stead.
OK, you caught me there. You knew I was kidding! You knew what I know which
is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools. Whatever we do will be
discredited and if we do nothing then Syria will become just another country in
the endless line of Hell on Earth Islamic countries.
We cannot save Muslims from themselves. It is like trying to save an
alcoholic. Until they are ready to abandon their religion – a religion that
emphasizes aggression and violence and sadism – anything we do will simply be a
band-aid on a gaping wound.
Let them go through their DTs on their own. Only then will they be ready for
our friendship and help, and only then will we find a way forward together as
friends.
“More Concrete Action Needed for Return of Kidnapped Schoolgirls Needed”  Not sure if this silly headline is by the author, Athanasius Georgy. What concert action?” George writes further “The country’s president, Goodluck Jonathan, has failed to wield influence, and the military has fallen short.” 
Exactly. So what needs to be done? More musical benefit shows? More internet websites? Use “diplomacy” against Boko Haram? No. They are savage, fanatical and virulent and not subject to talk and palaver. The only effective solution would be for the UN or other armed body to send a lot of troops and resources to comb a huge area in Africa to find and destroy Boko Haram. That isn’t going to happen. No one in the UN has appetite for this, and no one is suggesting that our country send its troops to fight Boko Haram. So what will be done? Not much. Boko Haram will continue their hideous actions until a powerful force takes them on. Sad, but there it is.

Pop music maven Taylor Swift graced the Nov. 24 cover of Time magazine, her blue eyes piercing, her expression poised. The headline of the magazine reads, “The Power of Taylor Swift,” referring to the singer’s multi-million dollar success. Along with its cover story, Time published an article by Charlotte Alter, detailing how the success of Swift and other notable famous youth affects fellow young adults of the millennial generation.
Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
According to the story, though there are so many avenues that today’s youth can take to become successful, whether they choose to be artists, entrepreneurs or scientists, they just haven’t reached their individual success swiftly enough yet. College students across the country plead with their mirror’s reflection, “Why haven’t I invented the newest craze in social media? Why haven’t I hit number one on the Billboard charts on the cusp of my 17th birthday?”
The answer seems simple. Computer science courses are challenging, and the competition to make the latest popular app seems to get more intense by the day. Alter’s article assumes that millennials’ pressure to succeed in their early 20s and 30s arises from the famously successful people just their age. But these sources are only part of the problem.
Parents who question why their special millennial has not made his or her first million yet greatly undervalue the hard work that successful millennials put into their craft. Sure, Mark Zuckerberg made his first billion by the time he was 23 years old, according to Forbes, but the road to the billion-dollar bank was anything but smooth. And yes, Malala Yousafzai did win the Nobel Peace Prize in October at the ripe age of 17, which makes the rest of us look lazy, but her prize is fitting for being able to increase the availability of education for girls all around the world.
Millennials and their parents have also been exposed to these feats of success in a manner that the world has never seen before. According to Pew Research Center, 81 percent of the millennial generation is active on Facebook with an average of 250 friends. Facebook, along with other social media websites such as Instagram and Twitter, expose millennials to the most current trends and events around the world.
Comparisons, then, naturally ensue — a story of most millennials versus their successful and famous role models. Comparisons inadvertently turn into competition, prompting these young adults to justify their existence with Facebook statuses detailing their recent successful trip to Yogurtland, or better yet, the myriad of Instagram car selfies to remind the world that they own a car, which is in itself a success. Yet, comparisons fail to acknowledge that success can be different: It comes differently for different people at different ages. Parents need to encourage young adults not to be afraid to risk time or money doing something that they are passionate about. This does not discredit the benefits of schooling and institutionalized education, but past models do not seem to be working for everyone. This is evidenced by the fact that, according to CNBC, student loan debt is at an all-time high and, according to the Economic Policy Institute, the unemployment rate for U.S. college graduates has been 8.5 percent since last May, a higher rate than before the national recession began.
Though the media might intend to inspire the public and youths with these stories, comparisons create unnecessary stress and competition. Young adult success stories warp what success means to younger generations. Specifically, economic success can take many different forms, ranging from owning a car to take a selfie in to raking in billions at the bank.
Unlike Swift, most millennials won’t be glorified for their individual successes during their youth. Yet, the race to individual success does not end in the teens, 20s and 30s — it begins there. For now, most USC students should strive to graduate. Finding a job is a success in its own right. And as for Taylor Swift, she might be the most recent young success story, but public interest will naturally shift to another millennial with time. That is, at least until her next album.
