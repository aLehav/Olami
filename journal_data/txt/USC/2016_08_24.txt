It might be possible to reverse permanent brain damage induced by stroke, a USC-led study published on Monday has found.
Funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the study was carried out by the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute at the Keck School of Medicine. It was released in Nature Medicine, a medical journal specializing in “basic findings that have clear implications for disease pathogenesis and therapy to the earliest phases of human investigation,” according to the journal’s website.
“This USC-led animal study could pave the way for a potential breakthrough in how we treat people who have experienced a stroke,” said Jim Koenig, a program director at the NINDS. “If the therapy works in humans, it could markedly accelerate the recovery of these patients.”
An estimated 800,000 people have a stroke every year, according to the Center for Disease Control. Seventy percent of those affected experience some degree of neurological damage such as paralysis or deterioration of muscular tissue. The study identified a protein that stimulates damaged neural stem cells to become functional again. 
Senior author of the study, Berislav Zlokovic, along with the rest of the research team, identified the protein as “3K3A-APC, a variant of the human protein ‘activated protein C,’” according to a USC News press release.
Zlokovic is the founder of ZZ Biotech, a company founded in 2006 to develop innovative treatments for neurological diseases.
“We showed that 3K3A-APC helps the grafted stem cells convert into neurons and make structural and functional connections with the host’s nervous system,” Zlokovic said in an interview with USC News. “No one in the stroke field has ever shown this, so I believe this is going to be the gold standard for future studies.”
Zlokovic and his fellow researchers aim to start with the second phase of experimentation. They will be testing whether their findings, which were studied using mice, will be successful in human trials. Should they succeed, they plan to expand the uses of the treatment beyond strokes to other neurological diseases.

Tax incentives given to the film industry don’t actually benefit states’ economies, according to a study released by a USC professor over the summer. 
Michael Thom, an assistant professor in the USC Price School of Public Policy, served as the lead author of the study. His findings showed that tax incentives have resulted in little to no economic growth for states, yet these states continue to invest in the film industry. 
Initially, states used tax breaks for film companies as a way to address the issue of the growing unemployment and to boost individual state’s economies. Despite the efforts, which include offering waivers on sales taxes, tax credits and rebates to film producers, states are losing millions of dollars every year. 
“We looked at job growth, wage growth, states’ share of the motion picture industry and the industry’s output in each state.” Thom said in a statement. “On average, the only benefits were short-term wage gains, mostly to people who already work in the industry. Job growth was almost nonexistent. Market share and industry output didn’t budge.” 
The failure of tax incentives to solve these problems has raised questions of how this will affect film students and filmmakers in the state of California. Thom believes that the film students in California have not been affected by film credits. 
“USC’s film school built its reputation without tax subsidies,” Thom said. “Students are attracted to our film school because of the school’s prestige and proximity to the industry. California’s tax subsidies specifically exclude student films, as well as other student-friendly projects.” 
Thom’s suggestions for California-based film students were less about the industry, and more about the cost of living in an expensive state.
“Students that want to stay in California should worry more about taxes, the cost of housing, regulatory burdens, and labor costs,” Thom said. “All of [these] are much higher here than almost every other state.”
The study indicated that a total of 36 states have continued to give the film industry tax incentives, with New York coming in as the biggest investor. New York University, which has one of the highest-ranked film schools in the nation, also continues to see high application numbers.
The biggest investors other than New York and California include  Louisiana, Connecticut and Georgia, and despite the lack of economic impact tax breaks provide, film students and filmmakers continue to flock to these states. The prestige and proximity to the movie industry, according to Thom, act as more important factors in the decision-making process than the potentially undesirable economic consequences.
“After a state has invested tens of millions of dollars, no politician wants to acknowledge that the program is a waste of taxpayer money,” Thom said.

Six USC students successfully passed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department on Wednesday after a 2013 incident in which LAPD officers allegedly raided an off-campus party and used excessive force against the mostly-black attendees. The settlement for $450,000 was approved by LA City Council according to the Los Angeles Times.
Around 2 a.m. on May 4, 2013, LAPD responded to a noise complaint at a student end-of-semester party with 79 police officers. The house around 23rd and Hoover streets was apparently targeted because it was hosting a predominantly black party. Attendees alleged a party across the street was left unabated because it was predominantly white, the Los Angeles Times stated. Six students were arrested, and one police officer was injured during the course of the shutdown.
Jessica Flores, who was a freshman majoring in communication in 2013, witnessed the events on May 4, and told the Daily Trojan that the force used against students was excessive.
“It was a completely innocent party. Just a bunch of people getting together celebrating and the fact that there was a white party across the street and they didn’t say anything to that party — I think that’s wrong and present-day racism,” Flores said.
The Monday after the incident, more than 100 students staged a sit-in protest in solidarity with the party attendees. The same day, Vice President for Student Affairs Michael Jackson offered to work alongside students to settle any wrongdoing.
“We have heard from many students who are upset with the events of early Saturday morning at an off-campus party,” Jackson said in a statement. “We understand their concern and are working closely with them, and commit ourselves to doing all we can to ensure respectful treatment of [students] at peaceful social gatherings.”
The day after the protest, an LAPD-DPS forum at was held on USC for students to voice their experiences. The Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom reached its 750-person capacity and 200 people had to be turned away. The event opened with a compilation of videos recorded by attendees of the May 4 party, which showed students being handcuffed by police. In one video, a female student is shown crying as she is handcuffed on the ground.
Four days after the initial event, on Wednesday, May 8, President C. L. Max Nikias weighed in on the incident.
“I had complete confidence in my leaders as they fully briefed me in advance on their discussions with student leaders and the plan for last night’s forum,” Nikias said in a statement. “I was pleased that there was an opportunity for an open dialogue and for people to express concerns.”
LAPD launched an investigation into the matter, but found that police officers’ reaction was justified since the party was re-started after it was shut down, according to the Los Angeles Times. Yet, several students continued with a lawsuit alleging excessive force and racial bias by LAPD officers. In June 2016, jurors found that several officers did use excessive force and did not have probable cause for arrests, yet the jury did not find officers acting on racial bias.

Approximately eight USC graduate and undergraduate students traveled to a Ugandan camp for a week this summer to educate children living in rural areas about health and well-being through the universal language of soccer. 
The camp was located outside of the capital city of Kampala in a small farming town called Mpigi. Heather Wipfli, associate director of the USC Institute for Global Health, has been running operations there for the past several years with the help of her 13-year-old son, who decided to start the nonprofit Ray United FC foundation to fund a soccer tournament for the children. 
USC students partnered with medical students at Makerere University in Uganda to teach wellness to 1,200 children aged 9 to 15 from 40 different schools in the Mpigi area. They also put packets together for teachers to continue their wellness education after the conclusion of the camp. 
The children spent half of their time in the classroom and the other half of their time on the soccer field competing with each other. Ray United FC brought in professional soccer coaches to train the children, provided the equipment for the games and hosted a tournament throughout the week. 
In the classroom, USC and Makerere students taught children about non-communicable diseases, prevention of malaria, social issues, environmental health, tobacco and alcohol and HIV and sexual health, among other topics. 
Kristin Bessie, who taught at the camp in 2015 to complete her Masters of Public Health, said that combining teaching with a sport that everyone loves is productive and helps the children stay focused. 
“The kids are all really excited to be able to get out on the field and play,” Bessie said. “They’re also really engaged in the classroom.”
The partnership with Makerere University made acclimating to the culture at Mpigi easier for USC students. 
“Their English is not the same English as ours, they look different and feel very foreign to the [USC] kids and the community,” Wipfli said. “I felt like we needed a way to gain better access to the community, and that’s why I reached out to the local university in Uganda.”
After the camp, students enjoyed a typical African safari. They also stayed for a second week to tour clinics and the national referral hospital in the Ugandan health system. 
Wipfli said that volunteers and participants alike benefitted from attending the camp. The Ugandan children left with tools they could use to maintain their health and the USC students were immersed in their field of interest. 
“Students have the ability to form relationships and partnerships with communities and gain access to communities in a way that they couldn’t through vacation or other volunteer opportunities,” Wipfli said. 
Bessie said that participating in this summer program was worthwhile, especially in her area of expertise.
“It was a really rewarding experience,” Bessie said. “It was a great application of all the skills that you acquire during the Masters of Public Health Program.”
In addition to continuing and strengthening the volunteer opportunities at the Mpigi location, Wipfli is working on expanding to Mozambique and offering the program as an alternative spring break to USC students.

Team USA’s men’s volleyball roster for the Rio 2016 Olympics featured eight first-time Olympians, four of whom are younger than the youngest player from the 2012 squad. One of these four was Micah Christenson, who graduated from USC last year.
Months before Team USA played in the 2012 Olympics in London, Christenson made his USC debut. As a freshman, he was named 2012 AVCA and Volleyball Magazine National Newcomer of the Year and 2012 MPSF Freshman of the Year. He made All-MPSF second team and was the only freshman named to the AVCA and Volleyball Magazine All-American second teams.
“Micah was a leader from the moment he walked on campus, and [he] set our team to the Final Four and a National Championship appearance,” former head coach Bill Ferguson said. “He had an immediate positive impact on our teams at USC. He was ultra focused from before day one. He has a matureness beyond his years; [he is] very attentive to fine technical detail and has the ability to retain tons of information from film study.”
Years before attending USC, the Hawaii native exhibited his innate ability to set a volleyball like no American before him. At age 16, Christenson became the youngest setter ever to play for the United States in a world championship when he represented the Boys’ Youth Team in 2009.
The bright setter ultimately came to USC to pursue the goal of making an Olympic team. After deep playoff runs in 2011 and 2012, the Trojans were considered a perennial powerhouse, believed to be capable of reaching the championship every year. But Tony Ciarelli, Christenson’s former teammate at USC and Team USA, noted that was not the case.
“I’m sure he thought we would be in the Final Four and in the NCAA Championship multiple times after that year,” Ciarelli said. “We all thought that, but that’s not how it works all the time.”
Christenson’s final three years at the Galen Center were turbulent times for the program. While he developed into the nation’s best setter, the team never managed another run to the Final Four. It had a losing record in 2013 and Ferguson was let go after the 2015 season.
Still, Christenson, a three-year co-captain, three-time AVCA All-American and two-time winner of the Off the Block Lloy Ball Award — presented to the nation’s top collegiate setter — always cared about the team first and foremost.
“The fact that he was about the team’s result meant everything when it came to the chemistry of the team on a day-to-day basis,” said USC teammate Chris Lischke, who graduated in 2015.
Lischke and Christenson talked a lot about playing for the national team and — one day — the Olympics, and Christenson’s opportunity came earlier than expected. In 2013, he made his debut with the national team at the NORCECA Continental Championship. In his debut, Christenson was named a Tournament All-Star, Best Server and Best Setter.
The 6-foot-6 setter is built to serve, set and block, but his leadership on and off the court makes him one of the best setters in the world. Humility, competitiveness, attention to detail, work ethic and volleyball savvy are just some of the traits that have enabled Christenson to ascend beyond collegiate prowess to becoming one of the premier setters in the world.
“He is one of the only players that I was able to coach differently,” current USC men’s volleyball head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “I never really told him that you have to do it this way or that way. With him, I simply told him that the best in the world that I’ve ever seen were able to do this or that, then I left him alone to work on it. Some of the more complex things took a while to materialize for him, but he always assimilated the upper level abilities.”
Christenson never won a national championship at USC, but Ferguson sees a silver lining amid the disappointment. He believes it is because of the adversity Christenson faced on the court at USC that he has quickly become an astute leader despite his youth.
“We struggled as a team his sophomore year, and he was very frustrated,” Ferguson said. “Micah took it to heart and worked and learned a great deal about leadership and people. He used that adversity to grow as a leader and led our teams well his final two years.”
In spite of the team’s struggles, Christenson developed the tools to lead on the biggest stages. Months after graduating, the 22-year-old was named Best Setter at the FIVB World Cup, where the United States won gold.
Heading into Rio, all eyes were on Christenson and Team USA. Though these games were the last  for some veteran players, they were the first for the next generation of U.S. stars headlined by Christenson.
Following a dismal start to the Olympics in which Team USA lost back-to-back matches to Canada and Italy in pool play, the United States rebounded with a four-set win over Brazil, propelling Team USA to a four match-win streak that culminated in a semifinals rematch with Italy.
Italy beat Team USA in a heartbreaking five-set comeback that ended gold medal dreams at Rio for U.S. teammates young and old. On Sunday morning, the deflated United States seemed unprepared for Russia in the bronze medal match, losing the first two games. Then, the young team — sparked by Christenson, its indomitable setter — stormed back to win three straight sets to earn an Olympic bronze.
For USA, the bronze is not ideal, but it is a step forward in the right direction — a return to Team USA’s winning heritage.
Nygaard speculates this year’s games is a stepping stone for Christenson on his path to becoming one of the best setters of all time. Lischke thinks Christenson will remember the games as “bittersweet.”
“This USA team has had quite a bit of success in this quad to show that they had a chance to go for a gold medal in this Olympics,” Lischke said. “It was a tough loss to Italy after having battled so far back in this Olympics after losing the first two games that it crushes you to come up short. But Micah also is aware that he has been blessed to compete for an Olympic medal at all, regardless of the color on it.”
Ciarelli believes Christenson will cherish these games as a result of what he learned at USC. Because he only got to the Final Four once despite all notions, preconceptions and projections, he told Ciarelli just before the games that he would treat Rio like it will be his only Olympics.
One Final Four or two, one Olympics or three, bronze or gold, Christenson’s legacy will only partially be written by his performance as a setter. At 23, he has already left and continues to leave his mark as a consummate competitor, teammate, friend and Trojan.
“During my time at USC, our standard was to be above reproach: Academically, athletically and socially,” Ferguson said. “Micah probably embodies that more than any other student athlete I coached at USC. He’s the guy you want with you when the going gets tough … He’s the guy you want on your team. He’s the guy you want your son to grow up and emulate.”

USC sophomore swimmer Tim Wynter’s Rio 2016 Olympics lasted just two days after the Opening Ceremony.
Despite falling short of the semifinals representing Jamaica in the 100-meter backstroke — his only race — the 20-year-old was not disappointed in the least by his Olympic debut.
“I wasn’t expecting to make the semifinals,” Wynter said. “It was my first Olympics, and I’m just happy to have qualified. I was just happy to be there.”
Wynter finished second in his heat, but his time wasn’t fast enough to advance. For a swimmer from Jamaica, though, simply being in the Olympics was an accomplishment.
Known for track and field, Jamaica sent 63 athletes to Rio de Janeiro — 59 of whom  were track and field athletes, and just two of whom were swimmers (Wynter and Alia Atkinson).
To make the Olympic roster, Wynter simply had to race against the clock, since Jamaica doesn’t have a big enough swimming contingency to hold qualifying races like those in the United States. On his first try, he came up just 0.02 seconds short.
“Devastated is probably too strong of a word, but I was unhappy that I was so close,” he said.
He got it the second time around in the Caribbean Islands Swimming Championships.
“I wouldn’t say I was surprised because I had put in the work to get the time, but I was just super excited,” Wynter said.
Wynter grew up in Jamaica and started swimming competitively when he was 5. He learned to swim when he was 2 years old because his family was moving to a new place that had a swimming pool and wanted him to understand water safety. Little did they know that would kick-start an Olympic swimming career.
He ranks among Jamaica’s top swimmers in history, holding six national and 21 National Age Group records before even coming to USC. But Wynter, who also occasionally competes in freestyle and butterfly, doesn’t care much for those accolades. He found out from a Jamaican reporter that he holds nearly every record in the country from the 11-12 age group to the national swimming record for the 1500-meter backstroke.
“I didn’t know that,” Wynter said. “It’s not something I think about, ever.”
Wynter moved to the United States at age 15, attending boarding school in Massachusetts. He acclimated well to a new country. Wynter, who speaks English with no discernible accent, said he watched American television shows in Jamaica and feels comfortable here.
He graduated high school in 2014, and took a gap year. He originally committed to Duke University, but rescinded his acceptance because he couldn’t see himself going to school in the South.
So he followed the sunshine to Los Angeles, playing a large role in his first season at USC. Already, he holds a top-10 time in school history in the 100-yard backstroke.
Still just 20 years of age, Wynter made sure he soaked in all of Rio in the free time he had after he was eliminated, visiting Christ the Redeemer, Sugarloaf Mountain and Copacabana.
Though he admitted he didn’t get as much camera time as his Olympic cohorts in track, Wynter had the pleasure of walking out with Jamaica in the Opening Ceremony and interacting with his more well-known countrymen.
“[Walking the ceremony] was definitely one of the highlights of the Olympic experience,” he said. “I know of a lot of the bigger track names but I didn’t get to interact with them that much in other games. Everyone was super friendly within Jamaican athletics.”
Even Usain Bolt, who Wynter had a chance to meet a few times, was amicable. Wynter called Bolt “down-to-earth,” and said the fastest man in the world would lounge around with his teammates and was a “huge jokester.” 
Track may be king in Jamaica, but Wynter hopes swimming will grow as a sport in Jamaica, where track and field, cricket and soccer are the major attractions.
“I think there is room to grow for swimming in the sport,” he said. “We have a lot of talent in the island, and we have pretty good facilities. It’s not a sport that has a high participation compared to track and field or cricket. I think participation will hopefully grow by having two swimmers in the Olympics.”
He can be a part of the future if he makes the roster for the Tokyo Summer Games in 2020, though he admitted he hasn’t thought about the next Olympics yet.
For now, he’ll return to USC and gear up for the swim season. Sporting a shirt reading “USC Olympian,” Wynter said he was grateful to be a part of the school’s Olympic tradition.
“Just walking around this place, you can see Olympic flags and Olympians on the TV screen [in Heritage Hall],” he said. “It’s surreal that I’m walking in the footsteps of so many great athletes USC has developed.”

The Olympic spirit is a phrase liberally tossed around to describe the athletes at the world’s greatest athletic stage every four summers. As defined by the Olympic Creed, the Olympic spirit is:
“The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win, but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph, but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered, but to have fought well.”
Should this be true? Sure. Is it? Probably not.
Athletes are inherently competitive, especially the best athletes from around the world, and it seems silly to be able to tell someone who wins for a living to be alright with not living just because it is a special occasion.
However, the Olympics are about more than sports. The stories are less frequently broadcast in NBC’s primetime coverage, but there are still heartwarming stories to be found throughout the Games. For example, the story of 41-year-old Oksana Chusovitina of Uzbekistan, who once competed for the Soviet Union and in Rio became the world’s oldest Olympic female gymnast, or weightlifter David Katoatau of Kiribati, who danced during the competition to raise awareness for climate change.
These are the stories that give the Olympic spirit meaning. Neither athlete medaled and yet their stories are ones that have the opportunity to be told.
For athletes in less glamorous sports from less glamorous lands with less chance of a glamorous endorsement, the Olympic spirit rings true. For the majority of athletes, the chance to compete in the Olympics comes with the knowledge that the experience is the most valuable asset. For the likes of superstars such as Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps or Simone Biles, the Olympics are more valuable as a launching point into the next wave of a career.
It is smart for these athletes to take advantage of the monetary and career opportunities that are tied to the Olympics for some of the more popular sports, but for the hundreds of other athletes who do not receive the same attention from the mainstream media, the best they can hope for is to embrace and honor the Olympic spirit.
The Olympic spirit is applicable in everyday life, and there are endless inspirational quotes conveying the same message. We see them everyday on friends’ Instagram bios and classmates’ notebooks, but most ordinary lives are so far removed from the Olympics it would be seemingly difficult to find inspiration in a creed meant for the world’s most impressive athletes.
And yet, here we all are, at the University of Southern California. No, it isn’t Oxford or Harvard, but without a doubt it is an extremely prestigious university who has graduated people who have changed the way the world operates and thinks.
All the students at USC were once the Olympians of their high school and now that they’ve won a medal, moved on to the next part of their education.
As a competitive student at USC, it is easy to get caught up in the “winners are the only ones who succeed” mentality, but upon closer inspection, the time spent at USC is more similar to a three-week stay at the Olympics than one might think.
As the Olympic creed says, the most important thing is to take part, so do not be afraid to experience USC in every avenue. Do not worry solely about winning, but also learn from the battle that college is every day in a variety of ways. As the creed finishes by saying that to fight well is the most essential aspect, it’s hard not to appreciate that as a Trojan, where we live by the motto, “Fight On!”

Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
USC’s Olympic legacy is unparalleled. Prior to the Rio games, more than 400 Trojan athletes have participated in a summer games, earning a total of 288 medals. However, one notable sport was missing a Trojan medal — men’s basketball. 
Former Trojan DeMar DeRozan made history this summer winning men’s basketball gold for the first time in USC history.
“You have the opportunity to represent your country and play for a gold medal,” DeRozan told NBATV. “It’s something that comes around every four years. You don’t get the opportunity to do it as often.”
DeRozan came to USC in 2008 as a five-star recruit from Compton High School. His decision to stay in Los Angeles was important, as it helped him achieve his goals while staying true to himself.
“Having that opportunity to go to a school that I looked up to, where I was from, staying home and playing and earning a name for myself coming out of there [was important],” DeRozan said to the Pac-12 Networks.
As a freshman, he led the Trojans in scoring as they fought their way to the quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament and became the Pac-12 Conference Tournament Champions. After the 2008-2009 season, DeRozan was ready for the next step in his basketball career, and he declared for the 2009 NBA Draft. The Toronto Raptors chose him with the ninth pick of the first round, making him the second highest NBA draft pick in USC history, behind only O.J. Mayo who was selected third overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2008.
Once in Toronto, DeRozan established himself as a powerful player, and he quickly became one of the faces of the Raptors along with Team USA teammate Kyle Lowry. After only seven years as a professional, the two-time NBA All-Star has been a member of the 2014 FIBA World Cup champions, and is now an Olympian.
Despite being an American playing in Canada during the NBA season, he has felt nothing but support from both countries.
“It’s the best of both worlds,” DeRozan said. “I know a lot of Canada is rooting for me and [Lowry] to win. When you have the power to move two countries, it’s a great feeling.”
On the Olympic stage, DeRozan continued to impress fans, coaches and teammates. He averaged 11.1 minutes a game in Rio, putting up 6.6 points and grabbing 1.4 rebounds per game. Team USA teammate, Golden State Warriors player Klay Thompson, was impressed with DeRozan.
“He is taking the Raptors to new heights,” Thompson said to the Pac-12 Networks. “He has worked every year. He loves basketball and works on it like there is no tomorrow.”
His focus and willingness to do whatever it takes to help the team is what makes him a valuable asset to the national team this year. He is willing to take on any role, even if that means sacrificing scoring points himself and not becoming the star of the show.
“It’s whatever Coach K … and these guys need me to do,” DeRozan said to USA Today. “Whether it’s playing defense and running the floor, I’m going to do it.”
That hard work and dedication to the sport has paid off for him. Shortly after he was chosen for the national team, he signed a $139 million, five-year deal with Toronto on the first day of free agency. Despite having multiple other offers, including one from his hometown team, the Los Angeles Lakers, DeRozan was set on staying in Toronto where he has a connection to the fans and to his team.
DeRozan brought home the final Olympic medal for America and for USC, bringing the total Trojan medal count to 309. DeRozan also has the opportunity to head to Tokyo in 2020 to compete for another one.

Fifteen PharmD students from the Keck School of Pharmacy embarked on an outreach trip to rural Romania to deliver much-needed medical care to citizens, according to USC News. Dr. Naomi Florea, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy, organized the two-week trip in July as part of the school’s Global Health Initiative. Three physicians and several Romanian translators accompanied the students
According to World Bank estimates, 70 percent of rural Romanians live below the poverty line, and healthcare services are lacking. The pharmacy students packed 850 pounds of medication into their suitcases before flying to the Eastern European country, according to a USC release. Tam Phan, a third-year pharmacy student who was in the program, described their journey.
“We each packed one suitcase full of medications,” Phan said. “We packed some toiletries in a carry-on, but it was mostly medication. It was scary going through security, although the Romanian government knew that we were coming and we had approval.”
The team treated 600 patients during their stay between the cities of Jilava and Burcioaia, according to Phan. Many of the patients had chronic diseases which required urgent care, and the lack of adequate healthcare and infrastructure meant that the patients who came for treatment from the students had advanced issues.
The USC students were aided by three Romanian physicians and Romanian medical students who often acted as translators. They treated patients with “chronic diseases, including diabetes, asthma, congestive heart failure and parasitic infections common in the agricultural region,” according to a press release by the USC School of Pharmacy.
“There was no electricity in parts of the town,” Phan said. “All of the drinking water was from wells, so a lot of the cases we saw were fungal infections, parasitic infections. I work at the pharmacy at USC where we stand behind a counter and treat people, but there people came in with very urgent cases that needed medical attention.”
The patients were mostly suffering from diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and infections, which the team treated with a bevy of medications. The pharmacy students also heard the personal stories of the patients. Phan mentioned a boy who was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia when it actually turned out that he was watching horror films at night. 
“This child was having night terrors, so the doctor diagnoses him with schizophrenia, and gives him antipsychotic medication,” Phan said. “But he comes to our clinic and we find out that he has been watching scary movies at night.”
Another family who had visited Phan’s clinic informed him of the trafficking problem in their country, a social issue that team encountered with one of the younger patients, according to the USC statement.
“This woman, she comes with her mother and four kids who all look very innocent,” Phan said. “I was doing her mother’s physical when she told us that many kids are subjected to trafficking in many parts of Romania and sometimes they would be sold for sexual purposes or organ donations.”
The trip to Romania is one of several global health trips that Florea has organized during her tenure at USC. Florea hopes to help pharmacy students to enact real-world change, according to a USC statement.
“In the U.S. they think pharmacists are people behind the CVS counters handing out medication, but here were are dealing with real-life issues. It gives another face to pharmacy,” Phan said. 
Another third-year pharmacy student, Ryan Hays, relished in the experience he gained while out in the field, although he described the conditions of Romania as much worse than he had expected.
“I didn’t expect it to be so bad, not to the extent that we saw. They didn’t have the health basic education that we do in the U.S.,” Hays said. “But you learn a lot more when you’re out there, it’s way better than staring at a textbook or a presentation.”

Courtesy of New North Co.Cause you’re all I need · The founders named their product New North after finding inspiration from the USC residential college of the same name. With a commitment to high quality design and organization, the bag serves as a way for users to store everything they need in one duffel bag.
USC alum Chandler Ho’s new bag company is called New North. If that sounds familiar, it’s not a coincidence — the company’s collaborators first met in the dorm of the same name as students at USC. The company’s founding purpose is simple: Cho wanted to design bags that specifically protect people’s shoes while they are traveling. Perfect for anyone who cannot stand the idea of a scuff on their Air Jordans, New North currently offers a duffel and a tote for this purpose.
Unlike many conventional bags, New North bags contain two compartments so that shoes may be carried around without fear of being crowded by other items. In fact, the main purpose of New North bags is to ensure that anything being carried remains undamaged. The duffel’s pockets are lined with microfiber, and the bag has “metal feet” so as to avoid dirtying the duffel itself. Focused on organization and appearance, Ho’s company aims to maintain the quality of your possessions with a polished aesthetic.
The Daily Trojan recently caught up with Ho to discuss the creative process behind making and marketing the product.
Daily Trojan:  What is your role in New North? 
Chandler Ho: I am one of the founders of New North and the lead designer for our products. I lived in the New North dorms back in 2004. That’s where I met the other founders. We were all taking  classes at Marshall, learning how the world of business operated. We had no idea that we’d ever team up for something like this. 
DT: It looks like New North encompasses a variety of bags. Do they all share the purpose of transporting shoes? What inspired you to create bags for that purpose?
CH: The great thing about the design is that it’s open-ended. We want to give people the flexibility to use the duffle and tote bag according to their lifestyle. I initially wanted to make a bag that would protect my shoes/sneakers and keep them separated, but I took a step back and realized that every person would benefit from such a feature.  Do you want to prevent your toiletries and hats from getting crushed? Are you coming back from the gym and want to keep your sweaty clothes and dirty shoes separated from your other things on the way home? Maybe you’re an organized person and don’t want to just cram things all together when you travel. The list goes on and on. In every circumstance, I see our bags offering a better experience with more options. 
DT: Is Kickstarter where you garner the most monetary support for your brand? Has it worked successfully before?
CH: Up until this point, we put forth our own savings and time into creating New North and the bags we have to offer. We are relying on Kickstarter to provide us the funds to cover production and shipping. There are many successful projects that found their beginnings on Kickstarter. This is my first experience, and it has been really exciting to receive support and feedback from so many different people. 
DT: Where can Kickstarter supporters expect their money to go and why should someone donate?
CH: We are so grateful for all of the Kickstarter supporters because it gives us the peace of mind to know that people appreciate what our bags have to offer. All of the support will go towards production and transportation costs, as well as enable us to create more products in the future. Kickstarter is great because everyone wins. We are able to gauge interest and generate funds before we go into full production, and Kickstarter supporters are able to get early access to products that have never been on the market and at a discounted price. So, I encourage everyone to take a look and support if interested.
DT: What do you see in the future of New North?
CH: We’re excited to see what the future holds. If this goes well, we have ideas of other unique products as well as variations of our bags that we want to produce. Our goal from the beginning is to create products that will enhance each person’s life. We try to live critical minded, evaluating our lives and all the things we use/interact with — thinking about ways for improvement. Out of that mindset comes inspiration for new designs and products. Hopefully this is just the beginning. 
More information about New North can be found online. New North’s Kickstarter was fully funded in one night after it’s launch last Sunday and will continue to produce more lifestyle bags.

Allen Pham | Daily TrojanSweet stuff · Former USC starting quarterback Matt Leinart (center-right) poses with USC Hospitality staff at the opening of the Sprinkles ATM at the Pertusati Bookstore Monday. The machine is the result of months of work by USC Hospitality to find a local vendor.
Though the recent addition of the Sprinkles ATM has drawn a lot of attention to the dining scene on campus, USC Hospitality has taken major strides in revamping and restructuring its venues and food offerings. With changes being made throughout the University Park Campus, several new developments have played an instrumental role in shaping the new culinary culture at USC.
The Sprinkles ATM, since its opening on Monday, has been a major attraction for students and community members. Sales and revenue numbers have not been revealed, but the dispensary has brought busy traffic to the Pertusati Bookstore. 
The partnership with Sprinkles has raised the question of whether or not the University will be able to control what happens with cupcakes left in the ATM after 24 hours. 
Erika Chesley, the associate director of marketing, development and training for USC Hospitality, said cupcakes that are not sold within Sprinkles’ 24-hour policy are donated to a local food bank. USC Hospitality, however, sees an opportunity to give back to the local community. 
“We are currently working with the University to establish a food bank for students with financial disadvantages,” Chesley said.
Another change that has been made is the addition of super foods and plant-based proteins to Seeds Marketplace’s existing salad bar. The new Superfood Protein Salad includes exotic items such as quinoa and goji berries. The establishment, one of the busiest dining locations on campus, has worked to ensure that it is providing its customers with healthy alternatives to meat proteins.
LiteraTea, located behind Doheny Library, has received a menu upgrade as well. The small cafe will offer four different types of cheese melt sandwiches. In addition, tomato bisque and other soups will be sold fresh daily to complement the sandwiches. 
Literatea is great for productive and picturesque study location. Alina Tang | Daily Trojan
Beyond menu changes, USC Hospitality has also opened its first cafe serving Pan-Asian cuisine. Fertitta Cafe, located at the Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall, offers a wide selection of foods such as banh mi, ramen, sushi, bao and dumplings. Within days of opening, the cafe has seen exponential growth in the amount of revenue. 
Adjacent to Fertitta Cafe, Popovich Cafe is undergoing renovation and changes of its own. Gary Marschall, the associate director of retail operations, said that USC Hospitality has been very intentional with theming different venues on campus to assess students’ needs. 
To differentiate Popovich Cafe from its neighbor, the cafe has experienced a major menu revamp. Following Labor Day weekend, the cafe will open again, serving exclusively Mediterranean food, such as wraps, salads and pita. In addition, the cafe will offer açaí bowls and coffee stations provided by Illy. 
Both cafes have established major success in partnering with local vendors. Fertitta Cafe secured an exclusive partnership with Phoenix Dessert, an upscale Chinese bakery, while Popovich Cafe has earned rights to sell items from Cuban-American owned business Porto’s Bakery. These partnerships have been pivotal to USC Hospitality’s desire to provide more locally-sourced foods to students and faculty. 
One of the final developments within the University’s dining scene is the addition of the Teaching Garden, which provides USC venues with fresh produce. Behind the USC Radisson Hotel on Figueroa Street, 60 towers have been installed with plants gardened under special technology. 
In addition, 20 towers are in the process of being installed at the residential dining complex EVK. The department has partnered with L.A. Urban Farms to manage various herbs and produce that have been grown since April. For the past several months, the garden has provided McKay’s, the Lab Gastropub and Moreton Fig with produce grown from farm to table. With the additional towers at Everybody’s Kitchen, many will be able to enjoy locally-grown produce.
Dirk De Jong expanded on USC Hospitality’s mission to serve the University community, and hopes to continue improving and adapting to the students’ needs. 
“Overall, our goal is to be able to provide all students with a unique dining experience through our diverse dining venues,” said De Jong. “We hope to create an interesting landscape where there are different dining options for everyone.”

New York City is home to thousands of street vendors offering a variety of food from all over the globe. This year, Angelenos welcomed The Halal Guys — a NYC staple to the street vendor community — to a restaurant in Koreatown for anyone who is looking for unique varieties of taste in street food.
The Halal Guys originally began as one street vendor in Manhattan. Over a span of 25 years, they have expanded to more carts and restaurants throughout New York, including its original location, which is now home to three carts serving up the same American Halal food. Over the past year, The Halal Guys made their way to the west coast and now have three locations in Costa Mesa, Long Beach and Koreatown.
Located on the corner of  Wilshire Boulevard and Mariposa Street, The Halal Guys hosts a casual fast-food joint serving Halal entrees from 10 a.m to 4 a.m.  
The name The Halal Guys honors the Islamic culinary diet. The restaurant itself is like walking into a hot dog cart if it were large enough to fit people. With its metal interior and bright lights, the menu is simple. Chicken, gyro or falafel can be chosen as an option to be served as a sandwich or as a platter. The legendary platter offers a protein of choice, tomatoes, shredded lettuce, pita bread and rice. Unlike traditional Middle Eastern restaurant wih similar dishes with white rice, The Halal Guys serve an orange rice, dyed by the colors of numerous spices added in the cooking process.
This all comes along with endless amounts of their signature red and white sauce.
The red and white sauce wrap the entire meal together to create a wholesome, harmonious signature dish that anyone would be sure to only find on the street of New York. Red sauce has a hot sauce-like consistency, but is spicier than presumed. The white sauce adds coolness to the dish as it closely resembles sour cream but has the freshness of yogurt and hints of Middle Eastern flavor.
Additionally, traditional baklava is offered for dessert. Large chunks of diced nuts lathered in honey are enclosed between numerous layers of thin puff pastry, creating a decadent finish to an enticing meal that has been originally made from a hot dog cart.
Despite being labeled as street vendor food, The Halal Guys’ hearty and wholesome meals leave customers satisfied with a plethora of Middle Eastern flavors. The American Halal cuisine is one worth trying for any meal of the day.

Bougey juice bars inhabited by Los Angeles’ swankiest hipsters, crunchy eateries packed with heavily pierced and tattooed rebels, and nature preserves encompassed by (high) tree-hugging hippies — these are some of the typecasts of vegans. Regardless of these awfully true stereotypes, veganism is trending for a variety of palpable reasons — mainly its unparalleled ethical, environmental and health benefits. 
If you had told me two years ago that I would soon become an avid vegan and animal rights activist, I would have laughed in your face. I considered myself to be a meat-eater that needed animal protein to survive until my brother, Zack introduced me to the world of veganism during my senior year of high school.
Zack made a convincing environmentally-based argument for his vegan lifestyle. He claimed that factory farming is the No. 1 contributor to climate change, as it causes 51 percent of our global greenhouse-gas emissions, that we’re causing species to go extinct in our oceans in the commercial fishing industry, and that it takes over 1,000 gallons of water to make one steak. To drive his argument past statistics, Zack focused on the unethical treatment of animals used for food, demonstrating his non-speciesist mentality. He preached that animals are sentient beings just as humans are and that we lose that connection when we consume animals thoughtlessly. The packaged chicken breast, for example, was once a chick who was born into confinement, living among tens of thousands of other birds in a filthy shed, collapsing under his or her legs due to artificial growth hormones, to be prematurely trucked to the slaughterhouse to be put out of lifelong misery.   
His compassion deeply inspired me, and caused me to go vegetarian for three weeks before making the full transition to veganism. Not to dogmatize my vegan journey, but I honestly noticed significant changes in my health. Physically, my skin cleared up, my nails and hair became thicker, and I easily gained muscle. Mentally, having cleared my cognitive dissonance, as I formerly claimed to be an environmentalist and an animal lover, I was satisfied that my actions justified my beliefs. Emotionally, I became a more empathetic person, as my private sphere of compassion (toward the animals) opened up to my public sphere (friends, family and strangers). 
The way I related to my food also really changed. My previous unhealthy relationship with food — restricting what I ate, religiously counting calories, and regarding food as good or bad — vanished, as I began to eat food because it was healthy, in an effort to nourish my body. 
Going vegan has taught me how important sticking to your beliefs is, and how the continual dedication to said beliefs reinforces your principles, thus empowering yourself and others. 
Providentially, college is the time to try new things, and being situated in Los Angeles makes it especially easy to try going vegan. On campus, the dining halls offer meat alternatives, including Gardein and Beyond Meat products, Nekter and Amazebowls offer refreshing acai bowls, and Starbucks (finally) offers almond milk as an alternative milk for all of their drinks. Off campus, build your own vegan pizza at either Blaze or Pizza Studio by opting for their vegan cheese, try Chipotle’s savory sofritas, indulge in vegan baked goods at Nature’s Brew, or (when late night hunger strikes) head over to Taco Bell for their bean burritos, minus the cheese. 
If you want to learn more about reasons for going vegan, I can recommend a few documentaries on Netflix that have different focuses; Cowspiracy — environmental, Earthlings — ethical, and Forks Over Knives — health. For those who enjoy reading, I highly recommend Animal Liberation by Peter Singer and/or Free The Animals by Ingrid Newkirk. To access hundreds of easy recipes that at most require a microwave, check out PETA’s Vegan College Cookbook and for a comprehensive piece of literature, check out their online Guide to Going Vegan. 
As Thomas Edison once said, “Non-violence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages.”

You realize that many things vegans tell you are lies.  They may not realize they are lying, most likely they are just repeating the same lies that they heard on a vegan chat room.  
As for your environmental concerns there have been studies that show, quite logically if you’ve the courage to look at them, that if everyone converted to veganism the impact on the planet would be worse than simply reducing our intake of meat and animal products to the USDA recommendations.  You see, currently cattle spend a large portion of their lives converting grass and weeds on the prairie into protein and fat.  Those grasses are not edible to humans and to use that marginal land for growing food for humans would be more environmentally damaging than leaving it to the cattle.  Before the 1930’s sod busters broke up the prairie grasses out in the Midwest and grew wheat. When the droughts hit the region all that topsoil turned to dust and blew away.  It took decades to get the land back to being productive.  Now we have learned our lesson and the land is left to the wild grasses that hold the topsoil together when droughts hit.  So ask yourself which is better, leave the prairie as grass for cattle or hack it up, spray it with pesticides and herbicides to run off into the rivers and if a drought hits watch the topsoil blow away?   
While it’s true that factory farming isn’t something pretty it’s a compromise we need to make to feed our numbers, you can’t turn chickens out on the open prairie and hope to harvest enough to feed people after the coyotes and wolves get done with them.  Even domesticated animals can be a problem, I’ve got a friend who raises chickens in a free range environment for eggs and her neighbors dogs got into them and killed several of her chickens.  Her chickens are fed not only grain but household scraps and any vermin or insects that wander into their area.  
Commercial fishing ventures have no desire to fish a species to extinction.  To do so makes no more sense than a factory owner burning his own factory to the ground.  From what will they make a living if they fish those species to extinction?  They’ve every reason to preserve those fish species just like a factory owner wants his factory to keep working.  Have there been mistakes made in the past?  Have some fishermen been less than ethical?  Of course, not everyone is honest and decent.  But you cannot paint all fishermen or businessmen with that same brush.  Most are good people who want to feed their families and the world.  
As for the 1,000 gallons of water to make a steak, I suspect that’s a tad inaccurate.  A 16 ounce steak containing 128,000 ounces of water?  That’s 8,000 ounces compressed into one ounce….  How does that work?  Most of that 8,000 ounces is pissed onto the ground and makes the grass grow that the cow will eat later on.  The animal is simply borrowing the water.
So keep an open mind on this.

Bloomberg News reported this week that NBC’s ratings and viewership for the Olympic Games were seriously underwhelming. In particular, the 18-49 year old age group was 25 percent smaller than four years ago, leading Bloomberg to conclude, as they so often do, that millennials are to blame for the dip in ratings. Likewise, the chief executive officer of NBCUniversal, Steve Burke, argued in June that if the ratings fell, it would be because “millennials had been in a Facebook bubble or a Snapchat bubble and the Olympics have come, and they didn’t know it.” 
The reality is this: the Rio Olympics revealed the hypocrisy of an Olympic Games that serves only to funnel money to a select few under the guise of international cooperation and relationship-building. So, while, to my knowledge, there was no concerted effort by millennials to not watch the Olympics, perhaps there should have been. 
Burke is probably right that millennials were in a social media bubble during the Olympics; however, the idea that social media prevented 20-somethings from knowing the games came and went is simply untrue. In fact, for many of us, Facebook is how we experienced the Summer Olympics this year. If you’ve logged onto Facebook in the last few weeks, chances are you’ve scrolled past Ryan Lochte memes, Simone Biles’ floor routine and several think pieces about sexism in Olympic coverage. The hashtag #Love4GabbyUSA, articles about Grindr in the Olympic Village and innumerable videos of athletes’ proposals all went viral. Millennials weren’t ignoring the Olympics; millennials were watching the Olympics in ways that didn’t profit NBC. 
Retweeting the video of Zac Efron and Simone Biles may seem unimportant, but the way in which the Games were experienced this year should be instructive not only for the networks that broadcast the Olympics, but also for the countries that host them and the organizations that execute them. The failure of NBC to ensure its coverage was accessible and engaging is only one sign that the world’s most popular sporting event is failing to keep up with the times. In the same way that Snapchat and Facebook democratized coverage of the sporting event and making it accessible to people in ways that NBC could not, the economics of the Olympic Games should be democratized as well. 
As it stands now, the Olympics benefits very few. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the only Olympic Games to produce a surplus for the host city were the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. In addition to spending billions, the host city does not even get to keep the revenues it makes — for example, the IOC receives almost half of the television revenue. After factoring in the displacement of people from their homes, redirection of public funds from social services and brutal policing in some communities, the costs facing a host country seem insurmountable. 
Though not bearing the brunt of this unequal distribution of wealth, the Olympic athletes are also treated unfairly. According to the Washington Post, “While many athletes struggle to pay their rent or buy groceries, the billions the Rio Games will generate will flow into the paychecks and extravagant perks enjoyed by IOC members [and] USOC staffers.” 
Until the Olympics becomes an event that promotes the equitable distribution of profit — to both athletes and host nations — perhaps the absence of millennial viewers will not be such a tragedy after all.

While the United States can be viewed as a fairly progressive nation, there are definitely issues from which  the nation’s policymakers shy away. Women’s health often receives this kind of treatment; it gets overlooked while issues that affect men actually see results.
A recent example that could change the face of women’s health is the California state bill allowing for tax-free purchases of feminine-hygiene products. California is fighting to be one of 11 states with such a policy. While removing taxes on feminine hygiene products would directly alter decades of unhealthy attitudes toward women’s health, this is also a politically and socially necessary move for the state of California. In an era where treatments for erectile dysfunction can be purchased without taxes, it is high time that pads and tampons — necessary products for unpreventable health concerns — get the same sort of privilege.
This bill, known as A.B. 1561, has passed through both houses of State Congress with support from both houses. One of the most obvious arguments in favor of the tax exemption comes from the understanding of what is necessary. When compared to male products, menstrual products reveal frightening statistics. Treatment for erectile dysfunction in males, known as Viagra, is left untaxed, while women must pay the extra sales tax for a product they must purchase. The notion leaves a lot to be desired. This discrepancy essentially becomes the beginning of an argument about gender inequality. Many women are rightfully angry at the unfairness of the situation; having sex is optional, whereas having a period is unavoidable.
The actual cost associated with these products can also be seen as a socioeconomic problem; taxes can affect the low-income population, and create a financial burden on those groups. Supporters of the tax claim that it is not centered solely on feminine hygiene products — products of all kinds get taxed. Yet California Assemblymember Ling Ling Chang stated it best when she noted that a sales tax is typically placed on luxury items, which pads and tampons are decidedly not. All in all, the bill would save women a good amount of money – it is estimated that women pay around $7 per month just on sales tax from purchasing periods and tampons. Though this money does not seem like much, a lifetime of paying an unavoidable $7 per month does begin to add up — something only women will have to worry about.
This issue has also brought to light even more disparities between men’s and women’s health. While topics like the menstrual cycle are frowned upon in general conversation, almost everyone over 16 knows what Viagra is, despite it not being a part of normal life. One of the major issues that persists is the stigma around the period, and how little the general public knows about it. Whether this is a result of poor sexual health education or poor women’s health awareness, perhaps major bills like this can get the movement started.
Excitement surrounding the state bill undoubtedly comes from the prospect of having conversation about a plethora of topics that are branched under women’s health. Whether this bill receives its due success or not, young people must continue to work to change how our society views women’s health and wellness.
I hope for your sake being an opinion writer isn’t what you’re in school for.  
I hope for your sake that writing comments on a college newspaper’s website is not what you spend your time on.

After Napoleon’s disastrous campaign in Russia, not more than a few months after his forces, the Grande Armée, were annihilated, the story goes that the Emperor declared peace over all of Europe one afternoon in his office with the visiting representative from the Congress of Vienna, Count Metternich, awkwardly standing as a witness.
As if it were that easy to just end all wars. 
It seemed then that war in Europe was over for a while. But, of course, the Continent would see much more bloodshed along with the rest of the world. Treaty after treaty, agreement after agreement — the cycle of conflict never seems to end. So, when is a war over? 
For Americans, and especially after heavy gunfire at American University in Kabul struck the news, that question remains close to home. The United States has emulated Napoleon, and thus the Middle East is our war-embroiled Europe. President Barack Obama in 2013 called for the withdrawal of more than 60,000 American troops from the War in Afghanistan, a conflict running more than 13 years by then. Yet, the United States seems to have a lot more trouble completely bringing a close to this conflict. Roughly 10,000 troops are still deployed in the war-torn state, with Americans still not sure of when the war will finally be “finished.”
The thoughts of an endless war are spiritually and emotionally draining. Alexander the Great’s conquest of Greek states, Persia and eventually parts of India is impressive. But his men had lost sight of the point of fighting after 10 years of campaigning and had enough of fighting. They were ready to mutiny. To many Americans, the similar sentiments of uncomfortable anxiety and frustration run high when there seems no end to a war. Afghanistan is overlapped by Iraq, and Iraq is overlapped by Afghanistan again. When is a war over?
Written about Napoleon’s invasion of Russia, an excerpt from War and Peace frighteningly  describes what type of opponents the U.S. faces in its quickly degenerating asymmetrical conflicts: “One of the most conspicuous and advantageous departures from the so-called rules of warfare is the independent action of men acting separately against men huddled together in a mass.”  It explains why a U.S.-led effort to stabilize the Middle East has failed. President George W. Bush’s War on Terror has inspired more independent actions from men acting separately against a uniformed group of foreign soldiers than it has eradicated. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers who committed the 9/11 terrorist attacks assumed for many Americans a stereotype and gross generalization of Saudi Arabia just because they happened to be Saudis. This is also true for pretty much most states in the Middle East with an Islamic influence. This kind of negative opinion adds to the flames that destroy stable states and create failed states.
But the biggest issue with an intervention in the Middle East is that the type of enemy any outside power would engage is one where even if a battle or two were won, there would still be no clear sign of victory because the issue goes deeper than military victories and failures. When U.S. forces eradicate most of the physical elements of some terror group, it is quickly played as a decisive, irreversible move by news outlets. “Mission Accomplished” banners are hung and “U-S-A” is chanted at baseball games. Yet, asymmetrical warfare is no game of chess. There is no black or white. There is but a camouflaged enemy whose activities become ghostlike. The institution that was just bombed goes from being a concrete enemy to an abstract one. The ideological movement of the group lives on within the tunnels and caves they hide in, still with plans to destroy America in their hearts. The most naïve form of trying to close a war is when we try to slap “Mission Accomplished” to every project that must be kept positive for the sake of political price tags but have clearly failed. 
 American fear for citizens overseas — and maintaining the peace — runs high after Kabul. Even when all but a few of your enemies are not in your grasp, peace isn’t just something declared as did Napoleon. As much as Americans love fresh starts, war is one thing you just can’t do that with. Coenus stated to Alexander, “…if there is one thing above all others a successful man should know, it is when to stop.” The end of a war is tricky. But it begins with taming the greed in every man’s heart to conquer till he can conquer no more. 
Yeah…OK.
In the Islamic jihad of southern Asia it is said that as many as 70 million Hindus were killed by Muslim jihadists.  America cic not even exist for most of that ruthless invasion.  Whose fault was that?  
In the Islamic jihad of Afghanistan – which happened long before America even existed – all the Buddhists who once lived there were killed or forcibly converted to Islam.  Whose fault was that?
In the Islamic jihad of north Africa most every single Berber was killed or forcibly converted.  Whose fault was that?  
Get real.  Islam’s core tenets are about violent confrontation with non-Muslims until Islam rules the world.  We did not bring this fight to Islam, they brought it to us.  This is not to excuse our ineptness in carrying out this war, but it is only to cast the war in its proper light.
