More than 60 students, bikers and pedestrians paused near Tommy Trojan Wednesday night to participate in the Trayvon Martin-Jordan Davis Candlelight Vigil hosted by the Black Student Assembly.

The event was organized to remember black men, women and youth who have been victims of violence, particularly in cases when race played a part. During the vigil, 12 people from the crowd read the stories of black men and women who were killed in the United States, a list that spans the past 70 years. A candle was lit next to the victims’ pictures on the steps of Tommy Trojan.
“I hear about these stories all the time,” said De’Ron Marques, a BSA executive board member. “We want to have others take note of these deaths and hope that people outside of this community take light of the situation.”
BSA Executive Director Ama Amoafo-Yeboah said she was overwhelmed by the cross-cultural support the event received and believed it raised the necessary awareness of the reality facing minority youth.
“Tonight really helped to highlight all the victims of violence,” Yeboah said. “But unfortunately this is only a small percentage of people who died everyday.”
The list of people included George Stinney, who at 14-years-old became the youngest person to be executed in the United States since the 1800s, and Ayanna Stanley Jones, a 7-year-old who was shot in the head during a police raid on her house. The most recent cases were 17-year-olds Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis in Florida, who have received national attention in the media.
Many participants said they felt honored to be part of the event to raise awareness for these crimes. Josh Carroll, a junior majoring in digital and print journalism, said the event was particularly important to him as an African-American male.
“I’m glad to be a part of bringing awareness of people being killed, especially since these people were around our age, who was also one of the speakers at the vigil,” Carroll said. “Without these vigils, their stories would be overlooked.”
The candlelight vigil capped off the events BSA had planned for Black History Month.
Way to go BSA! We are so proud of you. Keep standing up and speaking out.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Political Student Assembly and Political Science Undergraduate Association partnered to present the second “California Politics Roundtable Discussion” Wednesday evening.
Dream team · Former Assemblyman Anthony Portantino (left) and former California State Senator Tony Strickland (right) discussed elections. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The conversation featured USC’s two legislators in residence: former State Senator Tony Strickland and former Assemblyman Anthony Portantino. Portantino, who also teaches a class at USC, has been interacting and mentoring students since he and Strickland began the program last year.
Strickland said midterm election season needs more attention from students because it can have a more direct impact on them than national elections.
“Every election cycle is important,” Strickland said. “A lot of times people don’t focus on midterm elections, most people just focus on the presidential — it’s extremely important who represents you — historically, midterms have a lot lower turnout so the fact of the matter is with so many young people who are going to be involved in the political process, I think that’s a positive.”
Portantino agreed, and pointed out that turnout in midterms is much lower than years in which there is also a presidential election. When it came to the issue of key congressional races, Portantino also said many elected officials have lost faith in the way politics functions at the national level.
“With gridlock the way it is, if you’re in the minority party, it’s not fun,” he said.
Because the deadline to declare a political candidacy in California for the upcoming elections closes soon, Wednesday night’s discussion could not have come at a more relevant time. Portantino and Strickland (who recently declared his candidacy for United States Congress), discussed prospects for the 2014 midterm elections that feature important races at California’s local, state and national offices.
For Tara Campbell, a junior majoring in political science and broadcast and digital journalism, the most valuable part of the discussion was the influence of party organizations following California’s institution of a top two open primary, which does away with “registered party only” primaries and allows everyone to vote  to send the top two candidates, regardless of affiliation, to the general election.
“The fact that parties are probably going to start having internal fighting and have a line up system of, ‘It’s your time now, it’s your time now,’ is a scary concept for me because I want the best person at the time, not someone next in line,” Campbell said.
The seminar falls in line with the partnering organizations’ commitment to bringing politics closer to the students.
For Brandon Cheung, a sophomore majoring in political science, the seminar made elected officials much more human.
“I think it’s great that students get such direct access to two really influential guys,” he said. “And I think probably the most important thing about this is it shows us young people, who are disenchanted or disillusioned with the political system, how real these people are.”
Strickland urged students to take the enthusiasm inspired by the discussion and get involved.
“The barrier to get involved in government and politics is very simple: All you have to do is walk in and say, ‘I want to help,’” he said. “Whether you are a liberal or a conservative or in between a centrist, there are always candidates out there who would be eager to have them part of their coalition. All you have to do is show up.”

USC Distinguished Professor of English Percival Everett is one of five finalists for the 2013 PEN/Faulkner award for fiction. The award is the  largest  peer-juried honor for fiction writers. Everett was nominated for his novel Percival Everett by Virgil Russell.
Everett has  written more than 20 books and is the recipient of an Academy Award in Literature from The American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Fiction, the Dos Passos Prize and others.
The winner, announced on April 2, will receive $15,000 and the four remaining finalists will receive $5,000 each. All five honorees will be recognized at a ceremony at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. on May 10.
More than 420 novels and short story collections published in 2013 were considered for the award, with submissions from 132 publishing houses, from which a panel of three judges selected the five finalists.
Percival Everett by Virgil Russell focuses on the relationship between a father and son, with the narration switching between the two characters. The novel is broken into two sections, titled “Hesperus” and “Phosphorus,” a reference to the two names given to Venus in the morning and evening sky, respectively.
The novel was received well by critics including Mark Athiakis of the Washington Post who called the work, “a potent and thoughtful exploration of the bonds between fathers and children.”
Everett received his M.A. in fiction from Brown University and has been a professor of English at USC since 1998. He received the status of Distinguished Professor in 2007. He has previously taught at the University of Notre Dame and the University of California Riverside.
In addition to its award for fiction, currently in its 34th year, the PEN/Faulkner Foundation also hosts a reading series at the Folger Shakespeare Library, the PEN/Malamud award for excellence in short story, and the Writers in Schools program which brings distinguished authors to public schools in the capital.
The other finalists are Daniel Alarcón for At Night We Walk in Circles, Karen Joy Fowler for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, Joan Silber for Fools and Valerie Trueblood for Search Party: Stories of Rescue.

On Wednesday night, the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and the Marshall School of Business hosted international icon Cindy Crawford, who spoke about her experience building an enduring brand.
Model behavior · Cindy Crawford reflected on her achievements in both her modeling and business careers. She credited her success to her parents’ different personalities, referring to them as a “great balance.” – Kirstin Louie | Daily Trojan
 
Those in attendance included USC alumnus and benefactor Lloyd Greif and many USC faculty and staff.
The event was moderated by David Belasco, co-director and adjunct professor at the Greif Center. Belasco organizes entrepreneurs such as Crawford to speak as a part of his entrepreneurship class, BAEP 470: “The Entrepreneurial Mindset — Taking the Leap.” Past speakers for Belasco’s class have included everyone from the creators of Siri to Pete Carroll at last week’s event in Bovard Auditorium.
Crawford, who had a prominent modeling career before creating Meaningful Beauty and the Cindy Crawford Home Furniture, grew up in the Midwest, in what she referred to as a “small town, blue-collar world.” Crawford watched her parents get divorced at a young age, and she remembered vividly how this has impacted her viewpoints to this day.
“I saw my dad controlling my mother through money, when he would withhold her money every week,” Crawford said.
Seeing this relationship between her parents, Crawford was determined not to let anyone control her the way her father did her mother.
Because Crawford’s parents possessed opposite personalities, she was able to gain different but equally important traits from each of them. Crawford’s mother was an unconditional supporter of her decisions, Crawford’s father taught her to be ambitious and chase her dreams.
“It actually was a really great balance,” Crawford said.
Crawford’s parents are not the only people in her life who have shaped her to be who she is. While spending one quarter of college at Northwestern University before dropping out to pursue a modeling career, Crawford found that she was subjected to judgment based on her looks.
Walking into calculus on her first day of classes, the teacher looked at her and said, “Sweetie, I think you’re in the wrong class.” Rather than giving up, however, Crawford used her looks to her advantage and didn’t try to fight the unavoidable bias that exists in the world.
“You can take advantage of the way people treat you, too,” Crawford said. “You can learn how to work the system and it’s not fair, but instead of spending your whole life fighting, you can learn how to work your way through that.”
When she was just beginning her career in the modeling agency, Crawford noted that it was beneficial for her to sit back and take note while everyone around her did their jobs.
“If you’re interested and you keep your eyes and ears open, you learn,” Crawford said.
This ambition and mindset helped the international celebrity begin building her brand in her                             mid-twenties and enabled her to focus on her passion products.
When Crawford was approached with the opportunity to be the spokesperson for Revlon, she turned it down and instead took the option of building her own company, Meaningful Beauty, which just recently passed its billionth dollar in revenue.
“I believed in the idea and the intention behind Meaningful Beauty enough that I wanted to take the chance,” Crawford said.
Whether it is Meaningful Beauty or Cindy Crawford Home Furniture, Crawford has learned that the most important resource in any business is time.
“Budget your time in a way that reflects your passion and your goals and what you want to accomplish,” Crawford said. “My time is my greatest resource, so where do I want to give my time and which things give back to me?”
Though Crawford’s celebrity status has helped her brands take off, she notes that any product can’t be successful unless it is actually worth buying.
“I can get eyes on it, and then the product has to speak for itself,” Crawford said.
How come I didn’t know about this?! I would’ve attended just to see Cindy Crawford.

On Wednesday evening, acclaimed journalist and human rights activist Laura Ling spoke to students about her 140-day captivity in North Korea.
Detained · Laura Ling and fellow journalist Euna Lee were tried and found guilty of illegal entry in North Korea in June 2009. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
 
In 2009, while reporting along the China-North Korea border, Ling and fellow journalist Euna Lee were apprehended by North Korean soldiers. The two women were charged with illegal entry into North Korea and sentenced to 12 years of hard labor in a prison camp.
In August 2009, former President Bill Clinton met with former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang to negotiate Lee and Ling’s release.
“Five years ago, I thought I might never get the chance to see my family ever again,” Ling said. “But just this morning I kissed my                                       3-year-old daughter and my two-month-old baby boy, the children I once thought I might never get the chance to have.”
Ling traveled to the border to cover a story about North Korean defectors in China. Many of these defectors are women, trafficked into prostitution and arranged marriages.
Prior to her capture, Ling said that she prioritized her interviewees’ safety over her own.
“The ironic thing is that this wasn’t necessarily a story in which I was fearful for my own physical wellbeing,” Ling said. “Our biggest and main concern was for the safety and security of the people we had been interviewing.”
Ling noted, however, that the situation was extremely unpredictable.
“Anything can happen once you’re in the field,” Ling said. “Situations that you could never have planned for evolve, and you’re forced to react.”
On the day of her capture, Ling and her team went to the frozen Tumen River, the thoroughfare that separates China and North Korea. Though they did not intend to enter North Korea, their local guide ensured them that it was safe to cross. After filming for one minute on North Korean soil, the group was halfway across the river when Ling heard yelling from two armed soldiers.
Ling described her captor as particularly violent, beating and kicking her in the head. The soldier raised the butt of his rifle and struck Ling’s head, causing her to black out immediately.
“At one moment, I’m reporting on a humanitarian crisis that’s taking place along the border with China and North Korea that neither country wants the world to know about,” Ling said. “And in the very next moment, I’m a prisoner, in one of the most isolated countries in the world and one that views our own as its enemy.”
Ling described the ensuing 140 days as the most terrifying time of her life. She shared glimpses into her captivity in the so-called “hermit kingdom,” highlighting moments of compassion and humanity that she also experienced.
Ling recalled a conversation she had with a female guard. The guard expressed sadness that she had the opportunity to spend time with her family while Ling had been separated from hers for so long.
Throughout her detainment, Ling communicated periodically with her family. Her sister Lisa, a prominent broadcast journalist, reached out to her political connections and worked tirelessly to secure Laura’s release. After several discussions with North Korean authorities, Laura found out that Clinton would be the only acceptable envoy to negotiate her release.
“It was one of the lowest points of my captivity because I didn’t think someone of President Clinton’s stature would be approved to make such an unpredictable trip,” Ling said. “And so I mentally began to prepare myself to be sent to a labor camp.”
When she saw President Clinton before her, she experienced utter astonishment and disbelief.
“I swear he had a halo over his head,” Ling said.
Ling concluded her lecture by encouraging aspiring journalists to pursue their passion.
“Being able to make people more aware of what’s happening in our world and in our own backyard is a vital service, and one that I have found to be deeply rewarding.”

While attending USC, forward thinkers Zachary Goodman and Hassan Sarwar noticed students were missing an effective way to exchange stories on campus through mobile devices.
“We’re just making it easier to share stories on campus, and that’s what we really want to do,” Sarwar said. “We really think there’s no app out there that targets college students on their own and lets them share stories on campus.”
After meeting in a business entrepreneurship class, Goodman and Sarwar started brainstorming and bouncing ideas off of each other. It wasn’t until the duo was inspired to create CampusChatr, however, that they really began to develop one of those ideas.
CampusChatr is a semi-anonymous mobile app on which students from the same college campus can post stories on a feed and then vote on whether a story “rocks” or “sucks.”
Goodman, a junior majoring in business administration, is no stranger to innovation or leadership. His resume is already packed with projects, such as an ATM company he developed his freshman year. Originally from South Florida, Goodman came to USC despite his father’s ties to “that school across town” because he realized there are a lot of “gems that are at students’ disposal here.”
Sarwar, who graduated in 2013 with a degree in computer science and business administration and a minor in entrepreneurship, is no less ambitious. He started InifiniOne, a custom software development company, when he was a junior. The company, which focuses on mobile app development and e-commerce web design as well as mobile apps, has since grown since its start in 2012 to include eight engineers and designers.
The team acknowledged that  the benefits of using apps usually change over time and evolve based on the habits of the users. As such, the team plans on staying current by adapting CampusChatr to the trends of its users after it launches on March 15.
The app is relatively simple right now, but its creators plan to let it evolve based on user trends.
“We want to embrace product culture where we make sure we’re responding to the user,” Sarwar said.
Students can sign up by creating a username and four-digit password when the app officially launches. Be careful, however, because if users forget their password, there’s no way to get it back, because in order to remain anonymous on the app, CampusChatr will never ask for an email address.
Years ago, Sarwar envisioned CampusChatr as a website that had similar functionality to the app version. After discussing the idea with Goodman some time later, the two decided the idea was better suited to the medium of a mobile app. Sarwar feels that “everyone is using their phone now. No one is going to go home, go to their laptop, log in and post stuff. We wanted to bring this app to users’ palms, wherever they are.”
But how will it stand out against so many social media sites and apps already used for exchanging information? One of the unique benefits of using CampusChatr over Facebook groups such as USC Compliments is the missed connections feature.
“Let’s say you’re at a party or at Starbucks on Hoover and you make eye contact with someone and you weren’t able to talk to them,” Sarwar said. “You post it on CampusChatr and, if you go to the same school, you can message each other.”
Whereas on Facebook, someone might not want to go out on such a limb and reveal him or herself, missed connections on CampusChatr are semi-anonymous so there is no risk in contacting the person.
Sarwar explained it as “a complete messaging service but only those two people, the poster and the person that wants to message, can communicate.” Once the missed connection has been filled, it disappears so no one else can comment or “gang up on a weird situation,” Goodman said.
CampusChatr was also built with a self-reporting mechanism, which uses a complex algorithm to remove posts deemed offensive.
“We have great plans for success but it’s hard to say exactly how it’s going to be used entirely,” Goodman said. “As we’re both well-aware from our different lives and entrepreneurship, sometimes there’s one tiny service or small aspect that people love and then we’ll decide to focus on that.”

The Armenian Students’ Association at USC, which serves to promote and preserve Armenian culture, is collaborating with All-ASA to host “Artivism.” All-ASA is an organization that links ASAs from different California campuses. The event will take place in the upstairs showroom of Downtown French restaurant Les Noces Du Figaro.
Artivism aims to combine art and activism, a concept that recent graduate Ani Tatintsyan came up with last year when she was still a student at USC and served as the school’s representative for ASA.
“I came up with this idea of combining art with philanthropy, and having an art show where we can showcase local artists and also raise money for a cause,” Tatintsyan said. “I wanted to do a philanthropy that was different … something fresh.”
Last year, the on-campus group chose to work with One Armenia, a nonprofit organization based in Armenia which undertakes various humanitarian projects each month. The project they were working on at the time was spreading awareness of an abuse shelter in Armenia. ASA’s fundraising efforts raised almost $4,000, which they were able to contribute to the shelter. Tatintsyan estimates that more than 350 people were in attendance.
Tatintsyan said that the organization spreads the word by taking advantage of social media, and that the reason that they are doing the event again this year is, in part, because of the positive result from last year.
“Even though I graduated, I basically kept in touch with everyone and wanted to do it again for this year, and we came together again because it was so successful,” Tatintsyan said. “We were like, ‘Wow, this works, so we can probably keep it going.’”
This year, however, ASA chose to partner with someone different — Free Arts for Abused Children, a Malibu, Calif.-based organization which works with and provides art classes for abused or impoverished children.
“We wanted to do a more local [organization], so we could go there beforehand and see what everything was about,” Tatintsyan said. “We also wanted something to do with the arts. Because we were going to have an art exhibition, we wanted to see how we could incorporate that even more, to be a little bit more combined, so that was an organization that we found that does that on a local level.”
Despite the organization hailing from the area, the artists who are contributing their work are international and come from places ranging from London to the U.S. to even Armenia. Tatintsyan said that they received more than 40 art submissions, proving that it wasn’t too difficult to attract attention to the project.
“Artists are always trying to find outlets to showcase their work,” she said.
In addition to tickets to the event being sold for $10, the proceeds come from the sale of the artists’ work at the show, in which 25 percent of the sale goes to the cause.
Tatintsyan said that a wide variety of people attended last year.
“The demographic has such a range,” Tatintsyan said. “Last year, we were asking obviously younger people to attend, which they did, but so did older people … It was really interesting how art and philanthropy bring people together.”
But students play an even bigger role than just that of attendees.
“Most of the artists that are contributing are students from all around,” Tatintsyan said. “So I think students are the most important because they are kind of the background of the whole show.”
As for how the fundraising event will pan out in the future, Tatintsyan said she hopes to see it expand in its philanthropic efforts without being limited to a particular race or culture.
“I was talking about it being its own entity in the sense that obviously we’re the Armenian Students Association, but this year we’re working with an organization that is not affiliated with being Armenian at all,” Tatintsyan said. “I really want us … to go beyond that. I just want it to be successful in raising money for different causes, and raise awareness for issues and money for them.”

Greco-Roman mythology has always been a fertile ground for movie adaptations. Ancient storytellers created gods and monsters as a means of explaining everything from thunderstorms and tidal waves to the changing of the seasons, but in doing so they also produced hundreds of readily adaptable — not to mention conveniently public domain — epics, including many that served as direct precursors to the current superhero phenomenon.

This year has already seen its share of sword-and-sandal films, a sub-genre that takes its name from the cut-rate costume dramas cranked out by Italian studios in the 1950s and ’60s. Renny Harlin’s The Legend of Hercules, starring Kellan Lutz as the obligatorily shirtless demigod, charged into theaters in January and quickly became the year’s first commercial and critical flop, grossing less than $19 million domestic and garnering a dismal three percent score on Rotten Tomatoes. To put that in perspective, this year’s Razzie champion Movie 43 ended up with four percent.
Last month, Resident Evil schlockmeister Paul W.S. Anderson -— not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson, the brilliant auteur behind There Will Be Blood and Boogie Nights — embraced his inner Roland Emmerich with Pompeii, a cheap slice of disaster porn featuring Kit Harington from Game of Thrones as Milo, a studly slave-turned-gladiator who falls in love with a doe-eyed aristocrat (Emily Browning from Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events) in the days leading up to the city’s date with volcanic destiny. Anderson’s movie also failed to connect with U.S. audiences, grossing only $18 million after two weeks in wide release, a figure that must have been especially dispiriting given the film’s $100 million price tag.
That leads us to this Friday, which will see the arrival of 300: Rise of an Empire, the somewhat belated sequel to Zack Snyder’s 2006 box office hit. Unlike Harlin and Anderson’s costly misfires, Rise of an Empire is expected to do well in theaters, especially in large format (IMAX, XD Extreme Digital Cinema) and 3D venues. Much of this has to do with the enduring popularity of its predecessor, one of the most influential action spectacles of the past decade.
The original 300, adapted from Frank Miller and Lynn Varley’s graphic novel depicting a hyper-stylized retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae, where a small group of Spartan, Thespian and Theban warriors made a heroic last stand against a Persian force that numbered in the hundreds of thousands, has became something of a cultural phenomenon since its initial release, expanding its fanbase from comic book readers to action junkies, frat boys and even female viewers. The film was a ballet of blood and carnage that succeeded despite the inherent goofiness of watching a bunch of angry, sweaty men in leather diapers slice, gouge and impale their way through the armies of the pansexual bling-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), pausing only to flex their CGI-enhanced muscles and deliver rousing speeches about democratic freedom — never mind that Sparta itself was a hodgepodge of monarchy, democracy and military oligarchy. It also featured a star-making performance from Gerard Butler, who imbued King Leonidas with enough noble savagery and spittle-coated bombast to make up for his rather conspicuous Scottish accent.
Rise of an Empire, based on Miller’s forthcoming series Xerxes, runs parallel to the events of the first film. While Leonidas and his men lay down their lives defending the Hot Gates, the Athenian tactician Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) finds himself in a naval battle with a massive Persian armada commanded by Artemisia (Eva Green from Casino Royale), a ferocious warrior woman who might have had a hand in transforming Xerxes from a mere mortal to a would-be god. If the early reviews are any indication, Green’s scenery-devouring performance might be the unabashed highlight of the film. Though honestly, one look at her scenes from the trailer — “Today we will dance across the backs of dead Greeks!” — should have been a dead giveaway.
The rest of the film will apparently involve Leonidas’ widow Queen Gorgo, once again played by Game of Thrones actress Lena Headey, and her quest to avenge her husband’s death. It’s definitely encouraging to think that a film this testosterone-driven would dare to put two strong female characters front and center in its advertising. To be fair, Gorgo was given a pretty juicy subplot in the first film, one involving forum intrigue, a lascivious politician (Dominic West) and a killer role-reversal at the end — but it would be nice to see her in full-blown Kill Bill mode this time around.
Though Snyder produced Rise of an Empire and co-wrote the screenplay with Kurt Johnstad, his Batman Vs. Superman duties prevented him from returning to the director’s chair. In a move few could have predicted, Noam Murro, whose sole feature-length credit is the Dennis Quaid and Ellen Page comedy Smart People from back in 2008, was asked to step in. Only time will tell if this unconventional choice pays off. Has Murro, who has no little to no experience with big-budget filmmaking, simply cribbed from Snyder’s very distinctive stylistic playbook, or could we be seeing the emergence of an unlikely new career path for the Israeli-born filmmaker?
Another interesting addition to the lineup is Tom Holkenborg, better known as Junkie XL, the Dutch electronica composer who’s taking over composing duties from regular Snyder collaborator Tyler Bates. Though Junkie XL has an impeccable track record with film scores — including four collaborations with the legendary Hans Zimmer — Bates’ presence will be sorely missed. His choir-heavy track, “Returns A King,” was the unofficial theme of the first film and still shows up regularly at sporting events all over the world.
It’s always slightly bewildering to hear people dismiss 300 as nothing but disposable action fodder. Yes, it’s simple-minded and turns violence into operatic splatter art, but it has a fierce visual artistry that can’t be denied. The original film authentically captured the giddy thrill of mythmaking, the same feeling ancient audiences might have felt when they sat in front of a certain blind poet, reliving the final confrontation between Hector and Achilles outside the gates of Troy.
Hopefully Rise of an Empire can tap into that same creative energy, until the style develops a substance all its own.

It was an awkward elevator ride to the parking garage filled with movie critics and an awkward silence. You could hear a pin drop as each writer’s brain sadly contemplated director Eugenio Mira’s latest foray into the thriller genre.
The silence was suddenly broken by an elderly gentleman who looked like he wanted to do nothing more than send Mira to a work camp for the theft of the last 90 minutes of his life. His vain stab at optimism was the wittiest line heard since the previews.
“At least they didn’t blow up an airplane,” he said with a chuckle.
Unfortunately, that is about all that can be said for Grand Piano, a film that tells the story of Tom Selznick (Elijah Wood), a concert pianist who returns for the performance of his life after an episode with tremendous stage fright caused him to give up the profession years earlier. The movie, which premiered in Austin, Tex., at Fantastic Fest last September, hits theaters today in limited release. Watching the film is like the movie’s vague description of watching that early performance of Selznick’s — a remarkable and promising beginning that came to a cataclysmic end when it came time to play the last four bars.
As Selznick sits down at the piano bench in front of a sold out Chicago concert hall, he notices a note on his music sheet: “Play one wrong note, and you die.” Suddenly, Selznick — who already had fantastic stage fright — finds himself talking to an assassin (John Cusack) over an earpiece as he searches for answers about the sniper’s motive.
At around the midpoint of the film’s 90-minute run time, things start to sound a bit off-key. Whether the entire screenwriting staff ran out of hallucinogens or began watching rejected endings to M. Night Shyamalan films is anyone’s guess — but the fate of two of Selznick’s guests in the audience, Ashley (Tamsin Egerton) and Wayne (Allen Leech), begins this concert film’s descent into the orchestra pit. From there, the film rushes toward a dramatic conclusion that has more split ends than an Amanda Bynes wig.
On top of that, the film is built on a foundation of characters that seem to be stuck at middle-C. Wood turns in an above-average performance, but struggles to relate in key moments and adopts a remarkably lifeless expression in exactly the wrong moments. Kerry Bishé, as Tom’s wife, Emma, acts out a role that seems recruited from the average high school drama class. Like an animated Barbie, she watches the performance from a luxury space in the balcony; and for all of her camera time, it’s unclear what her role is other than to be on the receiving end of the sniper’s threat to blow her skull all over the seats if Tom fingers the wrong note.
The film briefly explores the juxtaposition between Emma, a shallow movie star with no real talent but plenty of appreciation, and Tom, a deeply gifted pianist who struggles to maintain a constant fan base. Sadly, this theme gets about as much attention as D-sharp and ends up in the ever-growing “lost potential” column. Another interesting motif the movie teases takes place backstage, when Selznick expresses his nerves at playing a wrong note to his conductor (Don McManus). The pair comes to the conclusion that no matter what happens on stage, the average audience never knows if a wrong note is played. It seems the producers of Grand Piano read this theme quite literally.
Yet for a movie about a concert, it is a predictable yet pleasant surprise that the score is the film’s greatest attribute. Wood, who took piano lessons as a child and spent three weeks training with an instructor to prepare for the film, delivers a beautiful performance on the ivories that reminds the audience of the true beauty of classical music. Sadly, a crash course in classical music appreciation is not worth the price of admission.
With every scene that convinces the audiences that Grand Piano has found a light at the end of a tunnel, it becomes clear that the approaching light is really an oncoming train. The plot careens hurriedly toward a clichéd and perplexing end, the cast remains in the shallow end of the kiddie pool and the film’s most interesting themes are left unexplored in favor of carelessly constructed adrenaline rushes as they come crashing down (literally). on stage. If there is any shred of optimism to close with, viewers can at least be glad that what comes crashing down on stage is not, in fact, an airplane.

USC junior Zoë Scandalis was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week yesterday for her impressive play between Feb. 25 and March 3. It is the second time in as many weeks that a player from USC has earned the conference award, after freshman Zoë Katz won it last week.
Scandalis, who is ranked No. 30 in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, pulled off two three-set singles wins in the past week and went undefeated in doubles play with her partner, junior Giuliana Olmos.
Last Saturday, Scandalis clinched a 4-3 victory for the No. 6 Women of Troy over then-No. 26 Texas.
In that match, USC got off to a hot start, winning all three doubles matches to go ahead 1-0 heading into singles play. Scandalis and Olmos, the sixth-ranked doubles team in the country, defeated their opponents 8-6. But the Longhorns roared back in singles to make things interesting.
Texas tied up the score when USC junior Sabrina Santamaria was forced to retire due to injury, which ended up being a season-ending ACL tear for the reigning NCAA doubles champion.
The teams traded points until the score got deadlocked at 3-3, leaving the fate of the match up to Scandalis.
After dropping the first set 7-6 (5) to Texas’ No. 77 Ratnika Batra, Scandalis put together a comeback victory, winning the next two sets 6-3, 6-4 to earn the Women of Troy their ninth victory of the season.
Before the Women of Troy headed to Texas, they faced No. 37 Saint Mary’s at home on Feb. 27. In that match, Scandalis and Olmos led their opponents 6-2 in doubles before their teammates clinched the doubles point for USC.
In singles play, Scandalis was once again the last to finish. Though USC had already clinched the victory, she was tied up with SMC’s No. 69 Jamie Pawid. Scandalis took the first set 6-3, but dropped the second set by the same school. Since the match was already decided, they opted to play a tiebreaker rather than a third set.
With both teams looking on, Scandalis and Pawid battled it out in a tight tiebreak. Eventually, Scandalis came out on top, 10-8, and USC won the match 5-2.
Scandalis has won a team-best five straight singles matches for the Women of Troy and holds a 7-1 record in dual matches this season. She has steadily climbed the national rankings after being left out of the ITA top 125 to open the season.
Scandalis and Olmos have also continued to impress the ITA, reaching a high of No. 4 in the nation earlier this season. Despite being the highest-ranked doubles squad on the team, the duo remains stalwart on court three.
Scandalis will need to keep up her impressive play this week, as USC takes on rival UCLA on Friday. Santamaria’s injury leaves a gaping hole at the top singles and doubles slot, which will cause a shift in the lineup.
The whole team will need to step up in order to beat the No. 3 Bruins. The match is set to begin at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

Two weeks ago, the USC women’s water polo team jumped into the pool at UC Irvine to take on CSU Bakersfield in the first round of the UCI Invitational. According to the schedule, the Women of Troy played a game that day, but according to the scoreboard, it was more like a shooting practice. The Trojans beat  the Roadrunners 21-1, with the lone CSU goal coming in the fourth period while trailing 19-0.

Tomorrow afternoon, the Women of Troy (13-0) will once again face off against CSU Bakersfield (9-13). Despite the lack of competitiveness in the last matchup, overwhelming excitement still resonates with  the team regarding the game. Tomorrow’s game will mark the beginning of an era for the newly renovated Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
“We’re definitely very, very excited,” said senior two-meter Maddie Rosenthal. “We just got to move into the locker room this week and it’s beautiful. It’s definitely the most incredible facility I’ve been able to practice in and I’m very excited to play here.”
After traveling from tournament to tournament on the road for more than a month to begin the season, the Women of Troy will finally be able to begin their home campaign in their second Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference game in as many weeks. Last week, the Women of Troy knocked off No. 5 Arizona State to kick off conference play. In the win, freshman driver Stephania Haralabidis recorded a first-half hat trick, earning her the MPSF Newcomer of the Week award.
“Steph has been incredible and she stepped up in two big games last weekend and then this weekend against ASU,” Rosenthal said. “We haven’t had a lefty on our team in a long time and she has an incredible shot. It’s really exciting as a senior to have such a ball of fire. She’s super fast and explosive and she’s a really fun player to play with.”
The award was Haralabidis’ second conference honor in her young career, as she collected the same title two weeks ago following her performance at the UCI Invitational. At the tournament, she led the incredibly diverse offensive Trojan squad in scoring, tallying 10 goals.
Though the first meeting with the Roadrunners didn’t pose much competition for the Women of Troy, the team did not let it cloud their preparation.
“We prepare for the biggest opponent every time,” said senior defender Kelly Mendoza. “We show our best game and we don’t stoop to anyone’s level. We play our game.”
During the matchup in Irvine, 11 different Women of Troy registered goals as part of the 21-1 rout. This is not something that occurred by accident for the Cardinal and Gold.
“It’s all about playing your role and setting up your teammate,” Rosenthal said. “We talk about that a lot. You have to make the extra pass.”
The Women of Troy will put their unblemished record on the line against a CSU Bakersfield squad that enters the matches on a four-game winning streak. In order to have a performance similar to the first outcome between the two teams, USC needs to stick to its strengths and execute the game plan, Mendoza said.
“Defense, counter-attacks and focusing on each possession every single quarter,” Mendoza said. “Take one possession at a time and we will move from there.”
No one knows whether the renovated facility will bring about as much success as the former, which includes three national championships in the past decade. Regardless, onlookers can be a part of USC’s first game there tomorrow at 5 p.m.

As the story goes, legendary USC baseball coach Rod Dedeaux used to buy a keg of beer before each home game and place it in the stands — along with some red cups — behind the visitors’ dugout, encouraging student attendance and helping them “loosen up” a bit before delivering their best heckles to that day’s opponent.
Regardless of amount of truth in that, what is true is this: Once upon a time, beer was sold to the public at USC baseball games. Over the last few years, beer has been available to select people in select areas. Slowly, year after year, that availability has expanded until it is now again accessible to all patrons of legal drinking age at USC baseball games.
“[Beer and baseball] just seem to go together,” said USC Director of Baseball Operations Marty Butterick, who spearheaded much of the process. “And there’s always been a lot of people requesting it.”
In 2010, USC baseball created a beer garden down behind the grandstand next to the Massman Theater. It was officially defined as a tailgate, complete with a six-foot fence and DPS officers.
“A lot of people told me it couldn’t be done,” Butterick said of those first tailgates.
Butterick checked with the campus events office to see if there was any reason that tailgates wouldn’t be allowed at sporting events other than football.
“That was the key question,” Butterick said. “If they were to come back and say, ‘No, you can only have them at football,’ that would have stopped it right there.”
While campus tailgating policies are generally applied to football and football only, there was no rule that said they couldn’t be applied elsewhere.
Meanwhile, clear across campus at the Galen Center, alcohol is served at USC basketball games in the Founders Room. So, baseball turned its Hall of Fame, the entrance to its offices, into a makeshift suite. In 2011, they hosted private parties during games, with alcohol strictly remaining inside the building.
In 2012, baseball was able to move those private parties to the roof of their offices, albeit on a very limited basis. While not inside like the Hall of Fame or the Founders Room, it is nonetheless a very defined and enclosed area.
Again, however, alcohol was prohibited from being brought into the main grandstands. Last season, baseball again held similar events on the roof, but their frequency increased dramatically.
“With each step, we were really careful to make sure there weren’t any issues,” Butterick said. “[That way] any people that might have concerns can see firsthand that maybe their concerns shouldn’t be as strong.”
Then came the big step: alcohol available to all of-age spectators at Dedeaux Field, beginning this season. Butterick credits Senior Associate Athletic Director Mark Jackson with helping him clear the final hurdle.
“[He] was an advocate for it,” Butterick said of Jackson. “Having someone at that level be behind it has really helped make that final push.”
The plan was initially to have another beer garden-type area this year, but, unlike in the past, it would be open to the public and have a view of the game. The bleachers down the right field line were considered a possibility, but Jackson helped convince both Athletic Department and university administration to try it out in the stadium as a whole.
Perhaps the key change, however, was the concession provider at USC baseball. For years, it was Aramark Sports and Entertainment, which still provides services for countless venues on campus, including the Galen Center.
This year, concessions at Dedeaux Field are provided by USC Hospitality, who are able to use their own campus liquor license, as they do at Traddies, and treat it as a regular catering event.
“I’m not sure if this could have happened if we had a different concessions provider,” Butterick said.
Regardless, it did. And now, beer and baseball are reunited.

USC’s men’s basketball team is in Pullman, Wash. today, playing its second to last game of the season against the Washington State Cougars.
Insufficient · Junior guard Byron Wesley averages 17.0 points per game but hasn’t been able to guide the Trojans to a victory in the past 10 contests. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
 
The two cellar dwellers have yet to meet this season, but matched up twice last season. The first meeting resulted in a tense four-point USC win at the Galen Center. Later in the year, the Cougars recorded one of their four conference wins with a 76-51 thrashing of the Trojans at Washington State’s Beasley Coliseum.
USC’s offense looked anemic  in that contest, with then-junior guard J.T. Terrell being the only Trojan to get into double figures.  This year has been more of the same for first-year head coach Andy Enfield’s squad.
Luckily for USC (10-19, 1-15 Pac-12), the Trojans will be matched up with the only Pac-12 team that has been as bad this season. Washington State (9-19, 2-14 Pac-12) is coming into the matchup against the Trojans following a 23-point rout at the hands of its in-state rival Washington Huskies, and is in the midst of a seven-game losing streak.
This seems to be the last winnable game for Enfield’s team, with a game against Washington (16-13, 8-8) just around the corner to finish up the regular season. The Trojans have lost 10 games in a row — their worst streak since 2012.
Shockingly, USC has actually led in the second half of six of the last 10 contests, and has been within five points in the second half of the other four games. The Trojans have been coming out of the gates strong, but have  struggled near the end of games where the outcome is usually decided by half-court offensive execution and free throw shooting.
Acquiring an elusive second Pac-12 win will require that the Trojans stop Washington State’s dynamic guard DaVonte Lacy. The Tacoma, Wash. native  averages 19.6 points per game for the Cougars, and is the only player on his team averaging double figures. Forward D.J. Shelton leads the team with 9.3 rebounds per game.
Meanwhile, Washington is led by a trio of dangerous guards in Andrew Andrews, C.J. Wilcox and Nigel Williams-Goss. Wilcox is the team’s leading scorer at 18.2 points per game. Williams-Goss,  Washington’s leading assist man at 4.1 per game, has come on strong in the last few games — the freshman dropped 17 points in the squad’s win over Washington State last week.
Following this road trip against the Washington schools, the Trojans will prepare for the Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas next week. Presumably entering as the 12th (and last) seed, the Trojans will most likely be matched up with the highest-seeded team that does not have a first-day bye (the top four teams do not play until the second day).
Interestingly enough, this means that the Trojans could be matched up with either Cal or Stanford — both teams they have competed very well against this season.
Their only conference win, in fact, was a 77-69 triumph over the then-unbeaten in conference Cal Golden Bears.
USC took Stanford to overtime in the second game of that road trip, with just eight points separating the team from a Bay Area sweep. The close loss represented the beginning of the current 10-game slide for the Trojans.
Though the wins have been sparse, those inside the USC locker room genuinely believe that the Trojans have been improving steadily during Enfield’s tenure.
“I think we’re getting better,” junior guard and leading scorer Byron Wesley said. “We’re playing free and enjoying ourselves.”
The fans certainly are not enjoying the mounting losses, but at least this year’s basketball team can be credited with playing hard game in and game out.
One of the major criticisms of Kevin O’Neill during his tenure as USC’s head coach was the overwhelming apathy that seemed to engulf the entire program. The Trojans this year have a pitiful record, but their coach believes they are playing hard.
“I’m proud of our players,” Enfield said. “They’ve had great attitudes and they’ve been very enthusiastic.”
Hopefully that enthusiasm will manifest itself into a pair of wins this week, just in time for a potential Pac-12 Tournament run.

After picking up a pair of wins on the road to finish off the regular season, the Women of Troy earned the No. 5 seed for the Pac-12 Tournament in Seattle and will open up against 12th-seeded Arizona today.
Secret weapon · Junior guard Ariya Crook enters the game against Arizona averaging 15.8 points per game for the Women of Troy. Crook did not play in USC’s game against the Wildcats earlier this season. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
The winner of today’s first-round game will move on to play against fourth-seeded Arizona State in the quarterfinals on Friday.
Should USC continue its road to the conference championship with a win against the Sun Devils, the team will be forced to take on the Pac-12’s best regular season team in No. 4 Stanford — assuming the Cardinal defeat the winner of Colorado and UCLA’s first-round matchup.
That semifinal game would take place on Saturday, with the championship game following on Sunday night.
A lot is on the line for the Women of Troy, as they will likely be playing for a bid to the NCAA Tournament. Their performance in the Pac-12 Tournament will gauge whether or not they will earn a shot to return to the Big Dance for the first time since 2006.
“I think it is definitely very possible to win the Pac-12 Tournament,” said senior forward Cassie Harberts, who was just named to the All-Pac-12 Team. “We took Stanford within five points [before] so we have really high expectations.”
The Women of Troy (18-12, 11-7 Pac-12) ended the regular season on a high note with two big road wins at Utah and Colorado and are looking to take that momentum into the Pac-12 tournament.
They will first be pairing with the worst team during the regular season in Arizona (5-24, 1-17), who only won one game in conference play.
In the two teams’ last meeting, USC jumped out to a huge lead, going up 42-23 early in the second half, before they had to withstand a late Wildcat rally. Led by the game-high 16 points of junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama, the Women of Troy were able to fend off the Wildcats to prevail on the road, 54-45.
USC’s size down low fares well in this matchup with Harberts and Vaioletama, as they out-rebounded the Wildcats 44-33 in their last meeting.
With a win, USC would advance to take on ASU, who bested the Women of Troy 94-86 in overtime earlier this season. In that meeting, both teams shot the ball exceptionally well, converting more than 50 percent of their attempts.
Before looking ahead to the Sun Devils, however, USC needs to take care of business against Arizona.
“We know we need to stay focused and we need to stay together, especially when things don’t go our way,” Harberts said.
It was a relatively successful regular season for the Women of Troy, who improved their overall win total by eight wins under the direction of first-year head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. Their 18 wins include 10 road victories, one coming against ranked California to go along with a season sweep of crosstown rival UCLA.
The Women of Troy also went through a stretch during which  they seemed unbeatable, winning nine out of 10 games, with the lone loss being the aforementioned overtime loss to ASU.
“It’s all really about defense,” said junior guard Kiki Alofaituli, who averages 4.1 points per game.
Cooper-Dyke’s constant harping on defense throughout the season produced results, as two players — Vaiolatema and sophomore guard Brianna Barrett — earned All-Pac-12 Defensive Team Honorable Mentions. Junior guard Ariya Crook also made All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention and guard Courtney Jaco was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Honorable Mention squad.
It has been an impressive inaugural campaign at USC for Cooper-Dyke, but the culmination of all of the team’s preparation and hard work will be tested in a tournament that is vital to USC’s drive toward March Madness.
Tip-off for USC vs. Arizona is set for 2:30 p.m. today and a win would land the Women of Troy in the same time slot against ASU on Friday.

If there is a land where you can dream of something and achieve it, it is the United States. At least that is what they say. He had heard this a million times before. In movies, in books. This was the whole concept of the United States. And that was what he kept reminding himself.
He feared that people would taunt him, make racist comments. He–, they might even attack him. This was not going to be easy. But then he thought he could be wrong. After all, this was the cultural melting pot of the world. All religions accepted, all races one.
The spirit of the United States accepts all and leaves none.
The plane taxied. After some walking, he found himself at the immigration check. Student Visa and his I-20 got him through the immigration easily. But he had started to notice something. Even though they said nothing, he could feel it in their eyes. Those angry stares. His smiles got no response.
He knew this was going to be tough.
He took a taxi directly for the university in Downtown Los Angeles. As he got out of the taxi, he heard angry voices. It was a group of skateboarders, practicing their flips near one of the university fountains. They couldn’t be more than 14 or 15-years-old. But what struck him most were their words.
“Yo, my cousin said he knew one of the Seals who hunted Osama.”
They made sure he could hear them.
It hurt him. His parents had warned him of this hurt, but it still did hurt — it pierced his soul.
Somehow he managed to find the International Student Affairs office building. He took the elevator to the sixth floor with an elderly lady. He was quite sure she would be scared, taking the elevator with someone who looked like him. But then it all changed.
She looked at him and said, “Aren’t you a Sikh, my dear?”
He caught his reflection in the steel elevator wall. The lady must have recognized his turban, beard and the iron bracelet on his right hand.
He smiled and said, “Yes ma’am, I’m a Sikh.” His faith in the U.S. spirit was restored. He felt that now he could call this land “home.”
This short story is a way to educate people about the racism that happens with the Sikhs in the United States — sometimes accidentally and sometimes not so accidentally. Sikhs wear turbans and keep unshorn hair and beards, as mandated by Sikhism. They become a target of hate comments because of their appearance. But Sikhs are one of the most peace-loving, hardworking, valiant and loyal people. They believe in Seva (community service) very strongly. They love to dance (lookup Bhangra), love to eat and love to talk. They have a very proud history, originating in India. They have helped in building foundations of many nations, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, to count a few. We even have a Sikh Student Association at USC that tries to spread awareness about Sikh beliefs and culture.
So the next time you see a Sikh, smile.

I was at Canter’s once in the Fairfax District and I saw a group of black teens making fun of a Hasdic man at the way he was dressed and appeared. I have also seen numerous times black teens make fun of Asian people – not so much for they way they were dressed – but just for merely being Asian. However, we rarely hear the progressive media talk about black young men needing to learn more about tolerance.
Yet, it seems the media LOVES to talk about people of color being discriminated against by THE MAN. We just can not get enough of this POV.
I am not saying the author of this article is wrong to feel the way he does. I am just saying we need to stop selectively choosing when we think racial prejudice is wrong.

According to every Republican, as well as seven politically weak Democrats in the Senate, defending an African American man from the death penalty is enough to disqualify someone from leading the civil rights division of the United States Justice Department. Yesterday, the Senate voted 52 to 47 to prevent moving to a final vote on President Barack Obama’s nomination of civil rights attorney Debo Adegbile. Blocking Adegbile’s nomination has serious implications for the discussion of civil rights in this country and is a gross slap in the face to the ideals the United States was founded on.
Design by Mollie Berg
Adegbile is one of the most well-respected civil rights attorneys in the country. In 2008, the lawyer argued before the Supreme Court in defense of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Adegbile also helped defend the law in 2013 when the Supreme Court voided key portions of the landmark legislation in the controversial Shelby County v. Holder.
The Senate’s decision follows controversy stemming from Adegbile’s work on the death penalty appeal of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of murdering police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981 and sentenced to death. In 2006, the NAACP’s Legal Defense and Educational Fund, for which Adegbile was an associate director, agreed to become Abu-Jamal’s counsel of record and to appeal his death sentence on the grounds that the sentencing jury received improper instructions. In 2008 and 2011, the federal court of appeals found the LDF’s claim valid, and Abu-Jamal’s sentence was reduced to life in prison.
In a letter addressed to President Obama, Chuck Canterbury, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, has called the nomination a “thumb in the eye of our nation’s law enforcement officers.” Though Officer Faulkner’s name doesn’t appear on a single legal document filed on behalf of Abu-Jamal by the LDF, according to the NAACP, the FOP wants to have its cake and eat it too. The LDF, of which Adegbile was acting president and director before he left to become a senior counsel for United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has represented hundreds of police officers and other first responders on matters of equal employment opportunities to ensure they aren’t fired for race-based or other discriminatory reasons. Vigorously defending anyone who we give our police the power to lock up is not a thumb in their eye — it is a sign of respect that bestows legitimacy to democracy.
The arguments get scarier. Though expected, Fox News’ host Greg Gutfeld’s description of Adegbile as a “cop killer’s coddler” is frightening. It’s even more frightening when that same thinking is echoed by the minority leader of the Senate, albeit in more politically correct terms.
“Everyone deserves a fair trial and a zealous legal defense,” said Mitch McConnell, minority leader of the Senate in a speech to the floor. “And lawyers aren’t personally responsible for the actions of their clients. But lawyers are responsible for their own actions. In this case, the nominee inserted his office in an effort to turn reality on its head, condemn honorable and selfless law enforcement officers and glorify an unrepentant cop-killer.”
The facts are enough to debunk the claim that Adegbile’s legal work centered on appealing the conviction of Abu-Jamal: nothing Adegbile did or wrote for the case disputed the fact that Abu-Jamal was convicted of murder. McConnell’s assertion that Abu-Jamal remains unrepentant is a red herring, but this line of thinking and the defense of Adegbile that it inspires (that he didn’t defend Abu-Jamal) begs a certain question — does it matter? The answer is a resounding no. Debo Adegbile could have conducted the opening statement, closing argument and cross-examination of every witness in that 1981 Philadelphia Courtroom on Abu-Jamal’s behalf and Congress still should have voted 100-0 to confirm him.
McConnell’s statement is a huge contradiction. If everyone deserves a zealous defense, why are the lawyers that do so turning reality on its head and glorifying those who they represent? The reality that McConnell prefers to live in appears to be one in which the circumstances of your crime determine the legal defense you receive, and that sounds more like the reality of the colonial United States — where dissenters were shipped to England for a trial — than it does the reality of present day.
So why did McConnell vote to confirm Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005? Roberts assisted in the defense of John Errol Ferguson, who was convicted of killing eight people and was subsequently executed last year. Would McConnell’s vote have been different if one of Ferguson’s victims had been a police officer?
One only needs to look at the United States Constitution, namely the Sixth Amendment.
“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence,” it reads.
Because Abu-Jamal faced the death penalty, here’s the 14th Amendment as well.
“No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,” it reads.
Read those words carefully. Millions of U.S. soldiers have died in the Constitution’s name, and with one fell swoop, 52 politicians attacked them not with weapons, but with votes. In particular, pay attention to the phrase “all criminal prosecutions.” It doesn’t say “all criminal prosecutions except those in which the accused murdered a police officer.”
In reality, the poor excuses for arguments advanced by people like McConnell could be political cover for advancing an agenda that includes voter discrimination. For some lawmakers, Adegbile could be a threat to the previously mentioned Shelby decision, which invalidated the 1965 Voting Rights Act provision that outlined certain states and districts for special scrutiny of their redistricting provisions.
Whatever the reason for blocking Adegbile, the fight is not over. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who favors confirming Adegbile, changed his vote to “no” for procedural reasons that will allow him to bring the nomination up for a vote again. For now, it is time for another serious conversation about civil rights in this country: Adegbile’s history of defending voting rights, combined with the shockingly skewed statistics involving minorities and death penalty cases, put the debate over his confirmation in an uncomfortable column. For 52 Senators, Adegbile’s past legal work makes him look out of place in the government’s white neighborhood — something George Zimmerman thought about Trayvon Martin before he pulled a trigger and started an explosive conversation about racism in the legal system. If the Senate wants to move that conversation forward, instead of setting it back, they’ll vote again to confirm Debo Adegbile, because the Constitution protects civil rights for all of us, not some of us.
Debo Adegbile did his job. The 52 Senators who voted to block him should do theirs.

Mumia Abu-Jamal did not request his legal counsel, and in fact, did not need any legal counsel. He had several high-powered lawyers and legal organizations in his corner. His status as a death row inmate attracted people to him who otherwise would not look twice at his case, due to their fervent opposition to capital punishment. As a supervisor for the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, Adegbile made a very political decision. Though he had no ethical, legal, or moral responsibility to do so, he chose to file an amicus brief in favor of Mr. Abu-Jamal’s appeal. He chose as well to travel to France to watch as a street was dedicated in favor of Mumia. He chose also to attend rallies on Mumia’s behalf.
Thank you for posting the truth Allison.

The dog days of spring — so-called because of the lack of football — are upon us.
But, for the die-hard fans out there, there’s still something to keep you going through the long, gameless weeks: The NFL draft. Several Trojans are in the mix this spring, and through the East/West Shrine Game, the Senior Bowl and the Mecca of all pre-draft workouts, the NFL Combine in Indianapolis, let’s see how they did:
Marquise Lee – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Marqise Lee, Wide Receiver
Project round: First, top 15
Everyone’s favorite Trojan Marqise Lee had no chance of taking over Clemson’s Sammy Watkins as the No. 1 receiver, but his appearance at the combine was necessary to hold off quickly rising Texas A&M star Mike Evans. He was by far the most impressive Trojan at the combine, performing well in all the athletically demonstrative drills. His only blemish was his relatively slow 4.52 40-yard dash, which was disappointing because he was expected to challenge the fastest time at the event (4.27, set by Marquise Goodwin in 2013). Luckily for Lee, he can erase this with a faster time at his Pro Day.
Dion Bailey, Safety
Projected round: Third to fifth
The linebacker-turned-safety will probably be the second Trojan to hear his name called in the draft, after Marqise Lee. Like most of his teammates, his numbers at the combine failed to jump off the page, also failing to shift him out of his position among the top five to 10 safeties, making him just as noteworthy after the combine as he was before. Still, a 4.66 40-yard dash is very respectable for a hard-hitting safety, and with a less-than-stellar safety class in this year’s draft, Bailey should find himself being selected in the upper middle rounds of the draft.
Marcus Martin, Offensive Guard/Center
Projected round: Fourth to Sixth
The high-upside offensive lineman didn’t participate in many drills aside from the bench press, likely due to the knee injury he suffered toward the end of the football season. But he failed to impress even on the bench press, only busting out 23 reps. Hopefully for Martin, talent evaluators will give him a pass on his injury and take him high in the draft.
Devon Kennard, Linebacker
Projected round: Fifth to seventh
Kennard had to turn heads at the combine to differentiate himself from the rest of the linebacking group in this year’s draft. Although he did fairly well with a 4.7 40-yard dash and an impressive 4.32 second 20-yard shuttle, none of his numbers blew scouts away. Kennard will have to impress at his Pro Day to move up on the draft boards. As long as he does nothing to hurt his draft stock from now until May 8, he should get drafted.
George Uko, Defensive Tackle
Projected round: Fourth to seventh
USC will be at a huge loss this fall without the interior presence of Uko. Though he proved his worth to the Trojans, he still had to generate the same kind of respect among NFL front offices. Like Kennard though, he did well in the athleticism drills but, posted a very poor 18 reps for a 6-foot-3 275 mammoth. He was a solid middle-of-the-draft option before the combine, but if he doesn’t improve on Pro Day, there’s a chance that he won’t get drafted at all.
Xavier Grimble, Tight End
Projected round: Sixth to undrafted
Many fans around campus grumbled when Grimble opted to leave early for the draft, especially because football aficionados knew that he wouldn’t be viewed too favorably after lackluster production in college. He didn’t perform particularly well in any area, leaving him amongst the masses of aspiring professional tight ends.
Silas Redd, Running Back
Projected round: Undrafted
Not much was expected of Penn State transfer, Silas Redd, and he matched those low expectations, posting a 4.68 40-yard dash time, slow for the running back position. Though he did post a respectable 18 reps in the 225-pound bench press, scouts will look at his tape to see unimpressive footage from his senior year, and likely advise their general managers not to select him in the draft.
