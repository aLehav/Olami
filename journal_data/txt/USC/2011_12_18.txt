USC junior defensive end Nick Perry has declared for the 2012 NFL draft.
It was announced that the 6-foot-3 defensive lineman would follow fellow junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil, opting to go pro.
“We counseled Nick throughout his decision-making process and we stand behind him on this decision,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “He was an awesome pass rushing for us and he created havoc throughout the Pac-12 this year in a league that featured many of the nation’s most dangerous passing offenses.”

In 2011, Perry had 55 total tackles and two forced fumbles. Perry led the Pac-12 conference with 9.5 sacks.
Perry started nine games at defensive end during the 2010 season. He had 25 tackles, including 7.5 for losses (with 4 sacks), plus three deflections, two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery.
As a redshirt freshman in 2009, Perry was used as a pass rusher, appearing in all 13 games. Perry had 24 tackles and eight sacks. He made the 2009 Football Writers Freshman All-American first team, Sporting News Freshman All-American first team, Phil Steele’s Freshman All-American first team, CollegeFootballNews.com Freshman All-American first team, ESPN.com Pac-10 All-Freshman first team and Sporting News Pac-10 All-Freshman first team.
“We value Nick’s time and efforts at USC and appreciate the standard he set for the defensive linemen who will follow him here,” Kiffin said. “We wish him much future success and know he’ll be another great Trojan in the NFL.”
Two of the four draft eligible juniors have declared for the NFL draft. Safety T.J. McDonald and quarterback Matt Barkley have not announced their decisions. Players have until mid-January to declare for the draft.

The month of December hasn’t been too kind to the USC men’s basketball team.
Facing Georgia at the Galen Center on Saturday in the second game of a four-game homestand, the Trojans (4-7) stumbled against the visiting Bulldogs, falling by a score of score of 63-59 – the Trojans’ third consecutive loss. They are currently winless in December with their last victory coming on Nov. 30 with a 56-35 win at UC Riverside.
For much of the season, defense has been the Trojans’ calling card, but against Georgia (5-5) in front of an announced crowd of 3,784, USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s group allowed the Bulldogs to shoot a season-high 51 percent from the field and an even higher 69 percent from 3-point range.
Guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, a former McDonald’s All-American last year, led Georgia with a game-high 21 points, converting on four of his five 3-point attempts. Georgia, collectively, would make nine from beyond the arc.
Despite its uncharacteristically shaky defensive performance, USC, nonetheless, had plenty of chances to notch what would have been its fifth victory of the season.
With just over 10 minutes remaining in the second half, it led 47-39, but slowly, Georgia crawled back, tying the score around the five-minute mark.
Within the waning moments, Caldwell-Pope nailed a 3-pointer to give the Bulldogs a 60-56 lead.
Trailing by four points with just under 24.6 seconds remaining, freshman guard Alexis Moore, on the very next possession, drilled a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to one. But Caldwell-Pope, on the next play, was fouled and made two free throws to give Georgia a late 62-59 lead.
On the nest play, however, Moore, who finished with a career-high 18 points, turned the ball and Georgia was able to preserve its first win since Nov. 22.
Sophomore guard Maurice Jones, once again playing all 40 minutes for USC, chipped in as well, scoring 11 points on 4-of-14 shooting. Junior forward Aaron Fuller added 10 points and nine rebounds, as well.
Saturday’s loss also marked the second straight game for USC that has come down to the final minutes. Against New Mexico a week ago, the Trojans led 41-40 late in the second half following a 3-point play from sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon before watching the Lobos convert all four free-throw attempts to preserve a three-point win.
All of the Trojans’ four losses at the Galen Center this season have come by six points or less.
USC returns to action next week, hosting TCU on Monday at 7:30 p.m. and No. 12 Kansas on Thursday at 8 p.m. in its final matchup of nonconference play.
[…] Georgia, one of the worst shooting teams in a BCS conference, to shoot a season-best 61.6 eFG% as they came back from an eight-point second half deficit to put the Trojans away. Bulldog freshman Kentavious Caldwell-Pope drilled a late three to ice the game and went for a […]
