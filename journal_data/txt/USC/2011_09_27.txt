On Tuesday afternoon, the Pac-12 reprimanded USC junior quarterback Matt Barkley for calling Arizona State’s Vontaze Burfict a “dirty player” last week in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. Coaches are often reprimanded for complaining about officiating, but this is the first time in recent memory the league office has handed down a reprimand to a student-athlete.
“All of our student-athletes must adhere to the Pac-12’s policies on sportsmanship and standards of conduct, which call for our student-athletes to treat opponents with respect and create and ensure a collegiate atmosphere in which to conduct competition,” Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott said. “In these circumstances, Mr. Barkley’s comments were a clear violation of conference rules, and he is being appropriately reprimanded.”
After practice Tuesday morning, prior to hearing of the reprimand, Barkley defended his comments, which were deemed “derogatory” and “inflammatory” by the league office.
“Of course everyone blew it up, but what you didn’t hear is that it was coming from a place ofrespect for Vontaze,” Barkley told reporters after practice. “I’ve played with him for so long. I know him as a player and a person and think he is a wonderful player, which is what I said. He played a great game. It doesn’t change what I said about him — I think it’s still true — but you’ve got to be careful because people twist your words and do whatever they want with them.”
Burfict has gained notoriety during his career at Arizona State for drawing personal foul penalties and even head-butting Oregon State quarterback Ryan Katz last year. On Saturday against the Trojans, he was only flagged once for a personal foul and intercepted Barkley on a screen play.
Though USC coach Lane Kiffin acknowledged that Barkley’s comments were inappropriate, he also defended his quarterback’s character.
“We talked to Matt right after he made that comment and told him that it was not appropriate,” Kiffin said in a statement. “He understood. Despite this reprimand, Matt Barkley represents everything that is good about college athletics. He is one of the finest student-athletes I have ever been around. You will not find a person with higher character (or) values.”
Barkley will not face any further repercussions stemming from the incident.

Four USC students are raising money to travel to South Korea and produce a documentary about Jong Rak Lee, a South Korean pastor who cares for disabled and abandoned children.

The documentary, which the students hope will raise awareness of the abandonment of disabled children in South Korea and other countries, will focus on a drop box created by Lee that allows parents to anonymously leave their disabled or unwanted children at an orphanage rather than killing or abandoning them.
“What Lee noticed was within the culture in South Korea, they would outcast people with disabilities because of the way the culture looked at them,” said Will Tober, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism and one of the project’s leaders. “Parents were abandoning their children and because of that and because of his heart for his own child with disabilities, he installed the drop box on side of his house for parents who were planning to abandon their children.”
Brian Ivie, a junior majoring in cinematic arts and critical studies, Tober, and two other USC students, along with four other students from other schools, will spend two weeks in Seoul during winter break.
Ivie and Tober first became aware of Lee’s drop box through an article published in the Los Angeles Times last summer. They sought more information from Lee about the drop box and quickly became motivated to help his cause.
“We were especially interested in [Lee] because it seems like the issue in South Korea was pushed aside and no one knew about it,” Tober said.
To produce the documentary, Ivie and his colleagues aim to raise $20,000 by the end of October. Though they have only raised $3,000 from family and friends thus far, Ivie said he is confident they will reach their goal.
“I have no doubt we will get the money together,” Ivie said. “I believe it is my duty to make this happen.”
Through the documentary, Ivie and Tober intend to establish a foundation for the orphanage at Lee’s house and use Christianity to help spread the message.
“Through this documentary we hope to create a foundation for him and educate people,” Tober said. “This isn’t a isolated incident. We want to use those funds to build a new facility for him so he is able to care for these orphans and use this as a platform to spread a gospel message and show God’s love through this particular person.”
Flashbulb Entertainment — a nationally recognized short-film company Tober and Ivie started during their freshman year — is producing the documentary. Flashbulb Entertainment’s films have helped raise attention to social issues ranging from homelessness to murder.
Tober said faith and passion for various social issues have played a pivotal role in the decision to produce short films and the upcoming documentary on Lee.
“Over the course of the years we’ve grown as filmmakers and our faith has especially been a big part of our to desire to make short-films and this documentary,” Tober said. “Our passion for this particular issue has made us more excited and ready to make a film like this.”
Ivie and Tober said USC has been an integral part of their development as filmmakers and has given them the courage to pursue their goals of raising awareness of social causes through film.
“As a critical studies major, I have been exposed to lots of genres and different styles of great filmmakers as well as professors who encourage you to become a pioneer in the film industry,” Ivie said. “At the same time, the major allows me the autonomy and flexibility to create several personal films so I can work in the field, make mistakes and get them out of my system.”
Bryce Komae, a junior majoring in business administration and music industry and a member of Flashbulb Entertainment, said he has no second thoughts about carving blocks of time out of his schedule to go and work on the documentary.
“We are very fortunate to live in a world where we don’t have many things to worry about that are life-threatening,” Komae said. “When I first heard about this [orphanage], I felt chills coming through my body because there are kids that are not loved or cared for and they don’t enjoy the privileges like quality education that we take for granted.”
Notice the contributions thus far fall short of the mark.  Here’s an idea, if it hasn’t already been thought of  or tried. There are numerous Korean Christian congregations in the greater L.A. area.  I suggest approaching as many of them as possible for contributions and support.
Abandonment of children happens in many places around the globe.  And there are many efforts everywhere, including Holt and other adoption agencies and orphanages that reach out and care for these precious children.  I am glad that these students found this story to tell and hope that they will be wildly successful in igniting altruistic passions in their communities with this film.   I don’t think that this is short-sighted at all.  It is great to see young people engaged in efforts like this.
Governments have shut down international adoptions because of projects such as these.  I have known children stuck in limbo when this happens.  I would ask that the film producers be sensitive to cultural and governamental bias and laws, do their homework on issues of abandonment, and be sympathetic to the adoption triad.  Altruistic passions are great but can come with some rather horrific unintended consequences when followed without understanding.
Hi Simone,
Brian Ivie here. I was wondering if you and I could sit down to discuss these issues further. It would help me to better understand where you’re coming from. I do, however, want you to know that I am doing research and that this article is not exhaustive in its summary of our understanding of the issues at hand. 
Email me at bivie@usc.edu.
Blessings!
Although focused the premise of this film is very short sighted.  Abandonment of less than perfect children and for years un-wanted female children is not new nor limited to Korea.  Harry and Bertha Holt were some of the first Christian leaders to help with the abandon children in Korea and their efforts lead to a model adoption agency.  At least two USC freshman students that I know of are Korean Adoptees who benefited from the Holts’ legacy.  The student film makers need to broaden their understanding of the Korean adoption history, contact groups like the AAAW, etc. before investing in such an enterprise.  Their efforts at this point are naive.

Etiquette coach Aleta Pottenger talks to members of the Society of Women Engineers Tuesday in The Forum of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., about how to act appropriately in business situations and how to network effectively.
Katherine Montgomery | Daily Trojan
This programs sounds diversified and informative.  I applaud any and all education that will help our young women (and men) become more effective in the professional work place.  The instructor looks serious, current, and professional.  What a fantastic opportunity to learn from the pros!
Trying to teach ugly dogs new tricks never works…..or was that old dogs?
Charm School?? Really?? Way to belittle an important informational session. Way to play into tired old stereotypes about how women achieve success. What would it have been had the audience been all male? 7 steps for highly effective networking?
Actually Rebecca if you knew anything about this event, you would understand that this was only ONE workshop. In other workshops we discussed things like Resumes, strategies for behavioral interviews and an entire workshop called exactly “How to Network Effectively”. 
The Society of Women Engineers is an organization that EMPOWERS women in engineering and strives to highlight all women in engineering with their successes and achievements. 
Rebecca, why don’t you do your research next time before you make assumptions about an organization on campus that has won the Tommy award for best Student Organization multiple times in the past years. Then maybe if you did, you’d realize how ignorant you sound.

With the recent and ongoing changes to the structure and design of Facebook, students are quickly adapting to the ongoing collision between the personal and professional world, learning how to merge the two for their own advantage.
Online · Henry Ammar, a junior majoring in business administration and policy, planning and development, uses his computer outside Marshall. - Zhiyi Feng | Daily Trojan
Now that employment history is both clearly linked to company pages and groups for individuals, the ever-decreasing gap between the professional platform and personal profile Facebook provides is more apparent than ever.
Now, users who list an employer that has a page on their profile have their profile linked to that page and have a list that shows news feed items from friends who also have that employer listed.
Executive director of the career center Carl Martellino said students need to edit their Facebook pages to use them as a networking tool.
“If you want to use Facebook more as a professional tool, you need to make it look more like your profile on LinkedIn because people are able to access your Facebook profile and make judgments about you,” Martellino said. “Who you are online, the profile you create on Facebook, is how you are going to be perceived, especially by employers seeking prospective candidates.”
Karen North, director of the Annenberg program in online communities, also said Facebook’s move toward integrating networking groups like LinkedIn and Twitter allows users to promote themselves professionally on their pages.
“Facebook has integrated these groups into the site, copying and integrating the tools these network groups use, including them in the site in order to … better meet the needs of [its] users,” North said.
Students said they have learned to embrace this closing gap between the professional and personal spheres.
John Tarver, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said Facebook’s changes self-propel its student users to show themselves in a professional light.
“Facebook is providing means to do so, the initiative and the drive [for students to market themselves],” Tarver said. “It is students saying, ‘I can use this to market myself.’”
Patrick Moynihan, a freshman majoring in theatre, said he created a Facebook specifically to network with potential employers.
“I’ve actually left my social Facebook behind and opened what’s basically a business Facebook account so that I could connect with people online in a professional context and keep up with people from various opportunities for professional networking,” Moynihan said.

The Undergraduate Student Government altered its bylaws Tuesday night to allow some senate resolutions to remain effective after the end of that senate’s term, rather than dying at the end of each term.
The amendment to the USG bylaws, which passed 11-0-1, will make resolutions effective for the duration of two USG senate terms. Each of the 12 senators can extend the life of one resolution during his or her term.
Resolutions allow USG to formally communicate the undergraduate student body’s stance on a particular issue to the administration, said USG Vice President Logan Lachman, a former Greek senator. In past years, effective resolutions have spurred improvements such as encouraging the wider implementation of USC Wireless Plus around campus.
“USG is the common link between the administration and students,” Lachman said. “When a resolution is passed stating that this is what the students want, the administration really takes that into consideration.”
Each senator is now permitted to sponsor one resolution with an extended life span per term.
The amendment’s author, residential senator Jordan Vieira, said the extension would be applicable for ongoing issues, such as extending campus center hours.
“Change is a slow process,” Vieira said. “Items that are really beneficial take the longest time to come to fruition.”
Because the amendment passes legislation on to a future senate, resolutions that take advantage of the extension will require passage by a three-fourths majority, rather than the simple majority most resolutions require. An incoming senate can also reject any extended resolutions with a two-thirds majority vote during the first four weeks of its new term.
Prior to the new rule, the maximum life span of a USG resolution was one term, unless the outgoing senate underwent an informal process in which it communicated to the incoming senate a desire for the resolution to remain in effect for an additional term.
“What I tried to do was take something that was an informal process and make it a formal dialogue mandated in the structure of the senate,” Vieira said.
Lachman said there have been several instances in past years where USG resolutions would have been implemented more quickly and efficiently had they been carried on to future senates.
Four years ago, USG passed a resolution advocating the establishment of a school holiday on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Though the change was made last January, Lachman said the proposal did not come to fruition as quickly as it could have because it was not extended during the next term.
Resolutions with an extended life-span will need to address topics that involve most students, Lachman said.
“They definitely have to be more general in order for them to be sustainable for years after and they have to affect a majority of students, not just one specific constituency,” Lachman said.
Vieira said he expects the amendment will encourage senators to craft more productive and meaningful resolutions because they will only be able to pass one piece of legislation with a life-extension.
Vieira also said he hopes the amendment creates a new medium for dialogue between incoming and outgoing USG administrations.
“If they have really great ideas that they don’t achieve in office, these resolutions can provide a channel to create longer-lasting effects,” he said.
Speaker Pro Tempore and Residential Senator Vinnie Prasad and Residential Senator Marissa Roy also sponsored the amendment.

Ten food trucks are set to turn The Row into a foodie’s paradise from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Thursday for USC’s second annual Food Truck Wars.
Food Truck Wars is a philanthropic event hosted by USC’s Interfraternity Council, USC’s Panhellenic Council and Chewse.com, a catering company, formerly known as Dish Dash L.A., started by two USC students.
Roach coach · This year’s Food Truck Wars will be highlighted by the addition of new caterers, such as Lake Street Creamery, the newly launched Macaroni and Cheese Factory and Uncle Lau’s BBQ — all of which will donate 10 percent of their sales to USC’s Troy Camp. - Photo courtesy of Gary Ferguson
All the trucks at this year’s event will be new. The newly launched Macaroni and Cheese Factory will serve various styles of cheesy goodness, and Uncle Lau’s BBQ will bring a taste of the islands to the streets. If sweets are more your thing, The Buttermilk Truck and The Lake Street Creamery, among others, have signed up.
The trucks will be split into two teams, one representing Interfraternity Council and one representing Panhellenic Council, whereas last year the east and west sides of The Row competed. The team that raises the most money will receive a trophy that will be passed around among its houses.
“Everyone is trying to do competitions on The Row,” said Helen Pastores, vice president of philanthropy for Panhellenic Council. “We thought instead of competing as houses it would be a lot easier if we compete as a whole.”
Greek and non-Greek students are welcome to chow down at the event. Ten percent of the proceeds will go to Troy Camp, USC’s oldest philanthropy benefitting children in the community.
Event organizers, such as USC alumna and Chewse.com founder Tracy Lawrence, chose to go a different route with this year’s fundraising after $1,600 was raised for Downtown-based nonprofit organizations at last year’s event.
“We wanted to keep it community-oriented and close to the students’ hearts, and Troy Camp is clearly really close to students,” Lawrence said.
Joanna Brodecki, director of yearlong programming for Troy Camp, hopes the funds raised from this year’s Food Truck Wars will help send a group of children to Disneyland as part of the group’s monthly adventures around the Los Angeles area.
“Our goal is to create stable adventures and show them that it is important to set goals and have something to work towards,” Brodecki said.
Organizers of the event, including Brodecki, have been working for almost a year in partnership with the Greek councils, a venture she hopes will be beneficial for all parties.
“[The partnership] is great because that way we can reach out to other organizations,” Brodecki said. “This way, we can help them and they can help us.”
This year’s proceeds are expected to increase, thanks to new sponsors, including Simply Sporty, West 27th Place, Allied Live and LiveNearUSC.com, all of which will give funding to bolster donations.

Lights, cameras and action enthrall the audience in Cirque du Soleil’s latest innovative production, Iris: A Journey Through the World of Cinema. In its return to Los Angeles, where Cirque du Soleil first earned critical acclaim, this impressive $100-million production debuted Sunday at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.
Inventive acrobats · Cirque du Soleil merges the worlds of acrobatics, cinema and theater in its newest production, Iris, using tantalizing multimedia displays, such as rear-screen projections. - Photo courtesy of Cirque du Soleil
Iris (“eee-rees”) takes the audience on a historical trip of cinema, all the while combining live performance and cinematography as it covers various cinematic genres and time periods, including sci-fi, western, noir and even their modern-day combinations; moreover, the performance revolves around a central love story, typical of any popular movie.
Director Philippe Decouflé’s sensational work moves the audience back and forth between laughing and gasping with breathtaking feats and humor by the cast of 72.
Characters interact with audience members as the latter file in to find their seats before the show. One girl in particular (Ekaterina Pirogovskaya) asks attendees to spin her skirt to get it to light up with moving images. Inspired by a dancer’s tutu, the skirt, designed by Philippe Guillotel, is called the Praxinoscope costume. The skirt is named after the animation device in which a band of images are placed inside a rotating cylinder spun by hand.
The costumes complement the dark carnival-like set designed by the creative mind of Jean Rabasse. On each side of the stage, a man with a monocle and top hat stares at the audience with his gaped mouth serving as a passageway. Atop the proscenium arch are the words “In Motion We Trust,” which set up the subject matter of the show.
The set appears to be typical of any live production — until Iris begins. Once the show starts, the worlds of acrobatics, cinema and theater merge. As twins Andrew Atherton and Kevin Atherton fly above the audience, the set turns into a screen projecting images of the acrobats. And throughout the remaining two and a half hours, the set is crucial for rear-screen projections and special effects.
The first half of the production is darker, with shadows on the set created by rear-screen projections, as the show delves into the world of black and white and animation. Unfortunately, the first half is also filled with weak jokes, like when one character says he is having a “Kodak moment” onstage.
During intermission, the show continues. Those who stay in their seats will be entertained by characters who reappear onstage. While some attendees take the opportunity to visit the restroom, various characters interact with audience members by making them laugh and dancing onstage.

Though the first half fails in its attempts at comedy, it makes up for this by awing audiences with incredible acrobatic feats and the second half’s genuine humor. In contrast to the first half, the second half turns into a livelier, more colorful stage. It transforms into a behind-the-scenes set of a movie and later transitions into an award show. In this scene, everyone, from the audience to the orchestra players in the box seats, becomes a part of the performance. The audience erupts in laughter, unlike the forced laughter from the first half.
An audience member is randomly selected as an award nominee and taken to the stage to accept the award, but another nominee interrupts his acceptance and challenges him to a contest. The success of the segment depends on the audience member at hand, in which case the characters run the risk of not picking out the most enthusiastic audience member. The act does indeed serve as one of the highlights of the show because of the audience interactivity and the jabs at the drama found in award shows.
Another minor hiccup of the show comes in the form of brightly colored acrobats in ant costumes who nearly fell while twirling and landing on their partner’s hands and feet, which contrasted with the perfectly in-sync performances by the other acrobats. And although the acrobatic numbers are breathtaking, a couple of them go on for a bit too long.
Nonetheless, Iris brings a different perspective to the world of cinema, adding elements not available to filmmakers, such as audience engagement and the possibility for error.
The show will run for an indefinite time at the Kodak Theatre for 11 months out of the year; February will hold no performances for preparation of the Academy Awards.

When most college students think of video games, they probably picture those sedentary Saturdays spent huddled around the TV, hunched over colorful, button-mashed controllers.
This image is something we can all relate to, and it’s the generic way video games fit into our lives: as stress-relievers, social experiments and solitary hobbies.
But for a handful of gamers, video games play a much more important role. Since the start of 2011, demand for video and computer game developers has been increasing.
USC has been ahead of the pack for quite some time. The School of Cinematic Arts developed its Interactive Media Division in 2002, a branch that has been ranked No. 1 in national game design programs two years in a row by Princeton Review. Clearly, USC has supported, if not instigated, this national trend toward legitimizing the “video game” degree as a practical, moneymaking asset.
The last decade fell witness to a dramatic increase in the number of people vying for career opportunities in the $50 billion-plus game industry, making it one of the most prolific — and, likewise, competitive — fields of our time.
The number of employees in the game industry is currently estimated at 120,000. In 2010, the average salary for video game designers ranged from a solid $66,000 to a heftier $80,000. For programmers, salaries often exceeded five figures.
Even with the allure of job openings, however, the number of women working in the game industry remains disproportionately low. Though the number of female gamers has gone up drastically in recent years, there has been little to no change in gender ratios on a professional level. The occurrence could be attributed to several factors such as stereotypes, discrimination or simply general disinterest in forging a career out of an already typically male-dominated hobby.
But for the most part, gamers are getting more serious about their career prospects, and those hoping to get paid for a favorite pasttime have pretty much hit the jackpot.
But that’s not to say these people aren’t hardworking or properly educated simply because their career titles have the word “game” in it.
In response to this revolutionary trend in the workforce, universities have, over the years, begun implementing variations of undergraduate and graduate programs in the realm of interactive media and game design.
According to the Entertainment Software Association, this academic year has seen a sharp increase in the number of game design programs being offered at institutions of higher learning. There are now 343 undergraduate and graduate programs for game design, development and programming available in 45 states as well as the District of Columbia. Compare that number to the measly 200 institutions that offered similar programs in January 2010.
California is home to the highest number of institutions offering degrees in game design. So it doesn’t hurt that USC is located in Los Angeles, one of the most vibrant, bustling cities in the gaming industry with endless opportunities for internships and fieldwork.
But why do so many students choose to enter this field? Besides the potential to earn high salaries, a degree in video game design encourages students to master both a highly technical and artistic craft. Essential computer skills grant them flexibility to move among different technologically-oriented careers, whereas experimentation with storylines, settings and characters allows for more creative and original approaches to projects and problems.
Additionally, with an active, aging generation of premier gamers coupled with a new generation of youths raised on the standards set by PlayStation 3s and Xbox 360s, video games have evolved from “kids’ toys” to a universally enjoyable form of entertainment. The Nintendo Wii was successful not simply because it flaunted motion controls but because it appealed to both casual and hardcore gamers. The market for video games is so expansive that even in the midst of a recession, it doesn’t look to be dwindling.
Even with so many people opting for this new and exciting career track, there is still a bit of a stigma against the idea of studying “video games.” But the success of the industry has proven that games are an indispensable part of our entertainment culture and, thus, so are their creators.

History is made by two groups of people: those who create it and those who record it.
The facts themselves often get lost over time, and it is left up to others to try and reconstruct the truth from what little information they have.
During the civil rights movement, people got to see history as it occurred. Whether it was a Martin Luther King Jr. speech or riveting footage of a black power rally, ordinary people were given the truth — straight up.
Featuring images of iconic figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Stokely Carmichael and Angela Davis, The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975 — directed by Swedish filmmaker Göran Olsson — attempts to recreate truth for audiences of the present.
More than anything, Olsson acts as an editor, piecing together nine years of footage from multiple Swedish journalists. Editing documentary footage is a touchy subject, and editors often risk being accused of misrepresenting history in the process. As a director, it’s easy to create biases and agendas in the process of making such a film.
Olsson, however, has handled his responsibilities beautifully. Rather than choose sides, he recognizes where his place lies: as an outsider observing, not re-crafting, history.
This goal is outlined in the first moments of the film. The opening credits claim the footage is simply what the Swedish journalists observed themselves, not an entire story of the movement.
What we do see, however, is mesmerizing. Perhaps it’s the laid-bare, raw feeling of the 16 mm format, but for whatever reason, it’s easy for the audience to feel as if it is the reporter, interviewing the pioneers of the black power movement.
Black Panther leader and activist Stokely Carmichael is the first such pioneer. He lights up the screen with hope and desperation, and one can feel the exhaustion he experienced trying to fight for a world that did not want him.
Carmichael is an incendiary speaker, filled with passion contrary to Martin Luther King Jr.’s more passive style of discourse. The Black Power Mixtape shows Carmichael as weary of not getting heard and as using “any means necessary” — even after being arrested countless times — to achieve his goals.
It is also incredible to see a young version of the scholar and political activist Angela Davis: skin scrubbed clean of make up, teeth protruding and hair in a massive afro. The impressive way in which she carries herself in the film belies her youth; she is only 26 years old in the footage.
Interviewees in The Black Power Mixtape are not restricted to famous revolutionary figures. There are a few effective sequences where everyday people offer heartbreaking anecdotes depicting why fighters like Carmichael and Davis were so vital in the fight for equal rights.
“I’m always trying to get out of the gutter but there’s something always holding me down,” one black soldier returning from Vietnam declares.
Those at home feel the pain too. A young girl from Harlem, with tears in her eyes, reveals how she goes to a corner every night to prostitute herself and how her addiction to dope is both ruining and saving her.
When we think of “black power,” we think of guns and radicals sporting afros. Rarely do we see the true people — and motivation — behind it. Why were blacks forced to be radical in the first place?
Perhaps it was to fight for young, disenchanted black Vietnam vets and for girls too embarrassed to tell her family that selling their bodies is the only choice they have. The fight was not to gain celebrity for those who spoke up; it was for those too weak to rally against a system that continuously puts them down.
Violence was just the way some black power freedom fighters decided to go about it, and since society is drawn to sensationalist stories, we remember the negatives instead of the positives, the radicals instead of the people.
The film gains more depth through modern voiceovers by figures such as Erykah Badu, Questlove, John Forté and even an aged Davis herself. Though these voiceovers sometimes feel unrelated to the images onscreen, The Black Power Mixtape still benefits from the opinions of these modern blacks, whose lives were directly affected by the decisions of their forefathers.
What The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975 does well is avoiding unnecessary commentary on our nation’s history. This proves to be a critical decision.
After all, the beauty of the film lies in its goal to objectively inform and show the humane side of a movement most famous for its violence — a revolution led by a minority who felt the drive to prove that they, too, deserved rights as Americans.
“Film depicts humane side of movement”
“Humane?”
Are you trying to say that the rest of the Black Power Movement, or overall the Civil Rights Movement, were inhumane?  Terrible, terrible title.  Your use of that word functions in an extremely derogatory fashion to people who fought for justice and empowerment.

I’ve come to understand that often a woman’s input can really help a man with the problems or issues he’s facing in his life.
As evidenced by their recent trip to the Arizona desert, the Trojans have their fair share of both problems and issues and most certainly could use a little help.
USC returned from Tempe, Ariz., with its collective tail between its legs, blistered and burnt by the Sun Devils in a 43-22 loss. The theme this week for the Trojans is bouncing back, as USC and its coaching staff search for the keys to rebound from last Saturday’s loss in time for this weekend’s home game against Arizona.
It wouldn’t be a bad idea for the big bad Trojans to walk across Heritage Hall and ask the No. 5 USC women’s volleyball team for a little advice.
Just two and a half weeks ago, the Women of Troy had a program record 5,385 fans attend their home match against UCLA, only to get swept in embarrassing fashion by their biggest rivals.
It would have been easy for the team to make excuses.
For one, 2010 Pac-10 Freshman of the Year Falyn Fonoimoana was declared ineligible one week before the start of the season under what are still very mysterious circumstances. Fonoimoana, a 6-foot-4 outside hitter, was second on the team last season with 398 kills and was an integral part of USC’s run to the Final Four a year ago.
Sophomore starting middle blocker Alexis Olgard had an offseason knee injury and has yet to play this season. Olgard made the All-Pac-10 Freshman Team last year and was second on the squad with 93 blocks.
The Women of Troy had also played their first six matches of the year in the Eastern time zone, making back-to-back weekend trips to Pennsylvania and Florida for tournaments. USC returned to Southern California only to face Cal State Northridge in a gym with a broken air conditioner on a day upwards of 100 degrees.
The players could have blamed any one of those things for the loss to UCLA and lamented their 5-3 start to what was supposed to have been a landmark season.
Instead, they responded with four straight sweeps of Pac-12 opponents, including knocking off No. 4 Washington on the road and No. 1 Cal and No. 2 Stanford at home.
Yes, the Trojan football team certainly could learn a thing or two from them.
But this story really isn’t about the football team or their problems.
The biggest USC-related headlines will always be reserved for Trojan football but the reality is that of USC’s 19 varsity athletic teams (excluding start-ups women’s lacrosse and sand volleyball), USC coach Lane Kiffin’s crew is the only one that can’t add to the university’s all-time haul of 115 national titles this year.
The women’s volleyball team is certainly at the top of the list of national championship contenders.
USC returned six of their seven starters from last year’s Final Four squad and has been bolstered by the impressive early season play of sophomore outside hitters Sara Shaw and Kirby Burnham and freshman middle blocker Hannah Schraer.
Of the four teams ranked above them in the polls, the Women of the Troy have already beaten Washington and Cal (now ranked No. 3 and No. 4 respectively). No. 2 UCLA has lost twice this season, leaving No. 1 Illinois as the only undefeated team left in the nation’s top-10.
USC’s victory over Cal also gave the team a mental boost, as it was the Golden Bears who swept the Women of Troy out of the national semifinals last December.
USC coach Mick Haley, however, still believes his team can get a lot better.
Following the Women of Troy’s Saturday sweep over Stanford (their first against the Cardinal in five years), Haley told USCTrojans.com that USC committed “way too many errors, didn’t serve tough enough and didn’t pass well.”
It’s not the first time Haley has been a harsh critic.
“I think we’re talented,” he said after a practice before the team’s Sept. 9 game against UCLA . “We’re not going to overpower teams like the 2002 and 2003 teams did but as our younger kids get stronger, I think we have a chance to do this right. But you never know. You have to go through it.”
Haley takes the wait-and-see approach because this isn’t his first rodeo. One of the most respected volleyball coaches in the country, Haley has won six national championships in his career, including two at USC in 2002 and 2003.
On second thought, maybe junior quarterback Matt Barkley and his teammates should call first before heading over to the volleyball office.
They might need to make an appointment because the Women of Troy are busy putting together their own special season.

While the NBA remains in an ongoing lockout, several former USC men’s basketball players will still play professionally this coming winter.
Stifling · Marcus Simmons (right), pictured here Feb. 24 at Galen Center against Arizona, was named 2011 Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Marcus Johnson, Marcus Simmons and Alex Stepheson, who each played for the Trojans at some point between 2008 and 2011, have signed contracts to play overseas in Sweden, Japan and Cyprus respectively, USC announced Tuesday.
Simmons, who was named the 2011 Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year last season after stopping some of the conference’s premier scorers such, as Arizona’s Derrick Williams — who was drafted No. 2 overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in June’s NBA draft — has signed to play for the Yokohama B-Corsairs of the Japan Basketball League.
When guarding Williams during a Feb. 24 upset victory over Arizona at Galen Center, Simmons held the forward to eight points on 3-for-11 shooting. The 6-foot-6 Simmons averaged 5 points and 2.8 rebounds per game for the Trojans a season ago. He was recruited out of Peabody High School in Alexandria, La., by then-coach Tim Floyd and joined the program in 2007.
“You want to get players that reflect your personality,” Yokohama coach Reggie Geary told USCTrojans.com. “Marcus Simmons is a hard-nosed, tough defender like myself — a person who’s made a name on defense, but by all accounts offensively is someone who I think is going to blossom.”
Stepheson, who logged more than 1,000 minutes at center for USC last season — averaging a near-double-double with 9.8 points and 9.2 rebounds — will play for the Proteas EKA AEL of the Cypriot League in Cyprus.
Johnson, who last played for the Trojans during the 2009-2010 season, will play professionally for the Sundsvall Dragons of the Swedish Basketball League. As a senior, the 6-foot-6 Johnson was USC’s third-leading scorer and rebounder, averaging 9.6 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. Last season he played professionally in Croatia.

USC coach Lane Kiffin said Tuesday he was unaware of former assistant coach Willie Mack Garza’s alleged payment to Houston-based talent scout Will Lyles in July 2009, as outlined by a Yahoo! Sports report released Monday.
Rocky road · USC coach Lane Kiffin served as the coach at Tennessee in 2009 when assistant Willie Mack Garza was alleged to have wired $1,500 to Houston-based talent Will Lyles to pay for the airfare for running back prospect Lache Seastrunk. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Garza, who resigned as USC’s secondary coach on Sept. 1 after citing personal issues “unrelated to USC,” is said to have wired $1,500 to Lyles to pay for plane tickets for an unofficial recruiting visit made by five-star running back recruit Lache Seastrunk.
“All I can say is that, the alleged incident, I had no knowledge of [it] or knowledge of a relationship at all,” said Kiffin, who acknowledged he had read the report. “I have been and always have been committed to doing things the right way and operating with the NCAA. That’s all I’ve got on it.”
When asked whether it was commonplace for a head coach or a recruiting coordinator, a capacity in which USC defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron was serving at the time, to be unaware of such an arrangement Kiffin offered a brief response.
“I don’t know,” he said. “I don’t know what people do.”
It is unknown whether the NCAA will re-open an investigation against Kiffin that dates back to his time at Tennessee from December 2008 to January 2010. Kiffin, however, declined to comment further.
“I can’t respond in any way to any of those questions,” Kiffin said. “I said what I said about knowing anything about it or anything having to do with that relationship or any of the things that are alleged.”
Despite losing in a rout in its first road game of the year at Arizona State, Kiffin made note of the team’s improved focus in its first practice heading into its matchup with Arizona on Saturday.
“[Practice] was much better than last Tuesday,” Kiffin said. “Guys came out with a good reaction to not playing well in the fourth quarter of last week.”
The Trojans hope to commit fewer turnovers in the red zone and penalties, which have been their Achilles’ heel through four games this season. Kiffin attributed such mistakes to the young and inexperienced players on the Trojan roster.
“There are really two steps to get over: The first is going through a game period,” Kiffin said. “The next one is going on the road.”
—
Junior safety T.J. McDonald was charged with three personal fouls following controversial hits to Sun Devil players Saturday.
“The penalty was unfortunate, but the fuel that comes behind it is something that we can all rally behind,” McDonald said.
McDonald stated he had no intention of injuring opponents.
“We knew they were going to come out and play a physical ball game,” he said. “That was one thing I knew coming into the game is that I had to play physical.”
—
With Arizona senior quarterback Nick Foles leading another strong passing attack, the Trojans are not planning to change their playing style.
“If receivers come across the middle, I’m not going to change a thing,” McDonald said. “I just try to be as physical as I can, that’s the only way I know how to play the game.”
This season, converting third-downs has been problematic for the offense so far.
“We need to correct things so we are not putting ourselves in bad situations,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley said.
Barkley added the Trojan offense needs to work on effective play making.
With a lackluster performance following a record-tying game, Barkley claims his most recent performance has not had an effect on his confidence heading into the fifth game of the season.
“You can take a step back and look at what happened but it doesn’t affect it at all,” Barkley said. “If anything, it might raise for me to be more confident.”
The last time Arizona visited, the Trojans lost 21-17.
“This is an exciting game for us to be back home in front of our crowd,” Kiffin said. “[We need to] work to get a win to get to four and one to go into the bye [week]. Last time they came in here, they won so I’m sure they will be confident.”
Kiffin credited the Wildcats for playing a difficult schedule despite coming into the Coliseum with a 1-3 record.
—
Sophomore cornerback Torin Harris, freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson, junior left tackle Matt Kalil, freshman running back Amir Carlisle and sophomore tight end Christian Thomas did not practice Tuesday. They could be ready as early as Wednesday and all are probable to play Saturday, Kiffin said.

The midterm, that mid-semester ritual celebrating the art of overcoming sleep-deprivation is upon us. All around us, students can be observed performing the rites of cramming, pulling an all-nighter and nervously breaking down. It’s a spectacle to behold, and one which varying class structures conspire to make last for more than a month.

The most peculiar change in behavior connected to the onset of these exams is the sudden rise in popularity of office hours. Generally our professors’ office hours are sparsely attended. Office hours are left unused by students who would benefit the most from them, save for a small dedicated slice of each class’s student body. It is only in dire times, such as midterm season or just before a major assignment is due, that they are used.
Going to office hours somehow fell into the subcategory of class supplements. It’s viewed as something helpful, but as it is optional, it is often ignored or forgotten. At its core, the underutilization of office hours is not an issue of laziness but because oftentimes they are not even considered.
Office hours would be more effective if they were by appointment only. Professors won’t waste their time sitting in an empty office. Also, students would be able to schedule an available time, instead of using the convenient excuse of schedule overlap. It would also allow more students to attend office hours.
With hundreds of students to deal with at one time, there is no way a professor in a class can give you any sort of personalized instruction, which can lead to a bit of culture shock to students accustomed to much smaller student-to-teacher ratios in high school.
These complaints fall a bit flat when considering the extreme lack of interest these same students seem to have in office hours, an opportunity for the most personal interaction possible with a teacher.
Though discussion sections help to alleviate that problem, they are not always effective.
From my experience, professors are more than willing to help a student with any questions he or she might have about the class. Who is better qualified than a professor to clarify any uncertainty relating to course material?
Many professors are baffled by this issue. Some are annoyed students are not taking advantage of the time they set aside, and others worry it is their fault. They sit alone in their offices with the doors open for a couple hours every week and wonder if their designated times conflict with their students’ schedules.
Then, when something is due, hoards of students they have never met complain about difficulties with class concepts. This cannot be the best use of available resources.
USC students do not take advantage of this valuable resource. It could be laziness, or it could be our busy schedules, but the root of the problem lies in a set belief of what successful study habits entail.
The university should encourage professors to remind students about office hours. They should bring it up every class until it finally enters the student body’s thinking. The best first step for getting students to start using the opportunity of office hours is to remind them that it is there in the first place.

According to a Sept. 19 data collection by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, automobile collisions have been replaced as the leading cause of accidental fatalities in the United States by a new kind of danger: drug overdose.
The latest report from the CDC includes the figures from 2009 and showed that 37,485 people died from prescription painkiller overdose in that year. The number, though already disturbingly high, only continues to grow. Time magazine also reports a rise of “63 percent between 1999 and 2004, and then another 27 percent between 2007 and 2009” of fatalities from drug overdose.
Columbia’s National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse   2007 report reveals almost half of the 5.4 million full-time college students in the United States “abuse drugs or drink alcohol on binges at least once a month.”
This disconcerting rise in deaths from drug overdose reflects an even more disturbing trend particularly affecting college-age youths.
Obviously USC faces the same problems as most other universities.  USC hardly fares any better with drug abuse on campus.  The university has the ability to take adequate preventative measures before a tragedy forces us to confront the situation by making drug education of prescription drugs more prevalent from the moment freshmen arrive for orientation.
Though certain programs, such as Trojans Care for Trojans, do exist, more specific measures targeting drug use are required. The establishment of more educational programs, coupled with an active university message about the dangers of prescription drug abuse will help curb abuse.
Educators should issue harsher warnings stating that, while abusing any drugs from amphetamines to opioids and narcotics can be dangerous, dangerous combinations of sedatives ,such as alcohol, anti-anxiety pills, sleeping pills, etc, have been shown to have the riskiest effects, according to the CDC.
In combination with “study-drugs” such as Adderall and Ritalin or a variety of other deadly cocktails, sedative drugs have made a palpable but largely disregarded imprint onto college campuses. USC’s orientation program should have a prescription drug education segment clearly illustrating the dangers of Adderall and other prescription drugs.
According to USA Today, “college students have higher rates of alcohol or drug addiction than the general public: 22.9 percent of students meet the medical definition for alcohol or drug abuse or dependence … compared with 8.5 percent of all people 12 and older.”
From 1999 to 2008, the United States witnessed a staggering 122% increase in college-age youth hospitalizations because of prescription painkillers such as Oxycontin, Vicodin and Demerol, according to a study done by  the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. A dangerous mix of painkiller abuse with alcohol consumption or anti-anxiety drugs has led to a tripling of deaths attributed to illegal painkiller use and a skyrocketing rise in hospitalizations.
Attempts by other universities such as prescription drug monitoring programs targeting vulnerable populations have appeared to have little to no effect on managing the continually rising rates of drug abuse and deaths.
Critics have often castigated doctors for carelessly prescribing painkillers to any random patient complaining from phantom afflictions, but the National Household Survey on Drug Use and Health has shown 83 percent of prescription drug abusers obtain their drugs from friends or relatives.
Though many students believe in programs preaching abstinence are too idealistic, Adderall should only be used by those who have a  legitimate prescription. The university has the ability to enforce these messages up front. Taking preventative action should be the route the university takes in drug education.
Joseph Califano, president of CASA, identifies the dismissive attitude of school administrators as a main source of the problem.
“[Drug abuse is] not on the radar screen of college presidents. This is not a priority,” Califano said to USA Today. “We believe they have an obligation to protect the health and safety of their students.”
CASA’s 2007 survey of administrators revealed that as high as two-thirds put the responsibility of stopping drug abuse solely upon the students. Though the ability to overcome drug abuse and addiction ultimately rests with the individual, it is disconcerting to see such a callous nonchalance about something as serious as deaths and hospitalizations because of overdose.
Though there are no formal facts and figures on drug abuse at USC, it most certainly does occur. The lack of concrete numbers and actions against drug abuse speak volumes about the importance of student abuse at USC and inaction from the administration.

Fans can now hop off the “Chariot” and indulge themselves in something “Sweeter,” singer and songwriter Gavin DeGraw’s newly released fourth album.
DeGraw hopes to reveal a different side of himself and take his talent to a whole new stage by collaborating with other artists for the first time. Debuting Sept. 20, 2011, the feature tracks include “Not Over You,” co-written with One Republic’s Ryan Tedder, and “Run Every Time,” with The Script’s Andrew Frampton. “Sweeter” uncovers a sexier side of DeGraw and makes him a more prominent artist.
DeGraw’s euphonious piano playing and warm voice is complimented by a gourmet blend of pop rock beats and soulful lyrics. Many tracks in the album are more upbeat than his typically mellow music. DeGraw sings from the heart. Each song is the manifestation of the artist’s advancement to more quality instrumental and vocal levels.
In addition to charismatic harmonies, the album comprises emotional songs about avoiding conflict and fading love. Throughout the album, DeGraw uncharacteristically casts himself as the bad guy.
The opening track reveals an expectedly mischievous and playful side of DeGraw, wherein he wants to steal someone’s girlfriend. “Sweeter” is a cheeky and masculine song playing around with the idea of envy and longing for something unattainable, but will accept the challenge to take anyways.
Veering off the usual elegant and jazzy act, DeGraw explores the modern realm of faster and louder harmony. Each song represents a different, relatable stage in life. A slice of pain and heartache each of us has felt at one time or another in our existence.
The song “Soldier,” true to its title, presents DeGraw’s sincerity and portrayal of himself as a selfless hero. Its soft harmony accompanied by a steady drum rendition is a soothing remedy for the blues and provides a comforting sense of loyalty.
With his song “Radiation,” DeGraw embraces events and sentiments that would otherwise be labeled flawed and better off forgotten. Filled with foot-tapping percussion and complete with a gruff voice for dramatic effect, this track is charming and quirky thanks to its rawness.
In accordance with its title, “Run Every Time” is dedicated to anyone who has ever faced commitment issues. It does not praise patronizing or object to the tug-of-war sentiment that comes along with such an ordeal. The song instead describes what it feels like to get too close someone, and the fluster and confusion that entails. The swirl of emotions in the words is matched perfectly by the song’s voluptuous beats.
DeGraw mixes genuine melodies with funky vocals. Overall, the album displays a  riveting spectrum of his aptitude. DeGraw combines his renown romantic antics with electrifying rock, shedding a spotlight on the singer’s secret witty personality. This album deserves four out of four stars.

Irvine, Calif., is a quiet town, the epitome of suburbia. On Saturday, however, it became the epicenter for a rock ‘n’ roll throw down.
The Verizon Wireless Amphitheater hosted the third annual Epicenter music festival, sponsored by KROQ. Smells of barbecued chicken kabobs mingled with clouds of cigarette smoke and beer-stained walkways.
The music was loud and nonstop, the way a rock show should be, especially one KROQ proclaimed to be Southern California’s rock festival. But one could be skeptical of the proclamation considering how the festival seemed a scaled-down version of the 2010 affair.
On the same weekend one year ago, KROQ held the second Epicenter in Fontana, Calif., at the Auto Club Speedway. It was a two-day affair featuring performances from Eminem, Kiss, Blink-182, Rise Against, Papa Roach and Bush.
The 2011 production was reduced to one day onle, moved to Irvine and the focused purely on a rock ‘n’ roll lineup.
KROQ lined up Staind, Buckcherry, Papa Roach, P.O.D., Skillet and Puddle of Mudd among others to perform. The station also booked an unexpected, buzz-creating headliner: the recently resurrected Limp Bizkit.
Unfortunately, rockers like Drive A and Crossfade had to perform early on the Monster Energy Stage, and were not seen by those who simply had not shown up yet. Christian hard rock metal band Red faced a similar fate.
The Nashville-based band was the first to play on the main stage, which opened at 4 p.m., but could only perform to a small crowd in the practically empty amphitheater because the rap-rock outfit P.O.D. had not finished performing on the Monster Energy Stage.
Nevertheless, Red put on a solid performance with a good amount of energy and finished strong with its 2007 hit “Breathe Into Me.”
P.O.D. also packed a good amount of energy into its set taking place just down the hill, but it was clear Red was the better choice for attendees as P.O.D.’s sound was off. The vocals were too low and the guitar too high to hear anyone else in the band, thus tarnishing popular tracks “Boom” and “Youth of the Nation.”
As can be expected, the festival had its fair share of other slip-ups. No performance was worse than Five Finger Death Punch’s set. Singer Ivan Moody tried too hard to act tough by making motions of slitting his throat and shooting himself while also criticizing security for attempting to remove a woman who was fighting in the seats; he threatened to stop singing if security threw her out. The band’s music was forgettable and mediocre.
Everlast, a rap/rock artist, performed his poorly voiced lackluster songs with about as little energy or enthusiasm as possible and disappointed from beginning to end. He even refused to leave the stage after it had revolved to reveal the set-up for the next band.
That next band was Skillet, a four-piece Christian rock group who provided an early main stage highlight with a memorable, riveting performance that injected some much-needed life into the crowd.
There was no brighter spot, however, than Papa Roach, who easily put on the festival’s best performance and captivated the entire audience. Front man Jacoby Shaddix commanded and electrified the crowd throughout the veteran Sacramento band’s 40-minute set, leaving the whole amphitheater chanting its name as the band members left the stage.
Headliners Limp Bizkit closed the night with an entertaining performance, its first appearance in Southern California in 10 years. The band blazed through its catalogue of fan favorites, such as “Nookie,” “Break Stuff” and the festival closer “Rollin’,” while also taking plenty of time for frontman Fred Durst to interact and banter with the crowd. Guitarist Wes Borland, per Limp Bizkit tradition, appeared in one of his original costumes, covered in black paint and wearing bright blue glowing goggles that people could see from the lawn.
Epicenter provided 12 non-stop hours of rock music, and a memorable night of strong performances and spectacles for the 15,000 attendees at Irvine.
I love Papa Roach and wish I could have been there.  Sounds like the writer of this review had an awesome time!!

The new Sura food truck provides affordable and delectable options for both health- and taste-conscious Korean food enthusiasts.
Sura food truck | Photo courtesy of Alan Wong
My first impression upon seeing the Sura truck was that it served more genuine Korean food than other food trucks selling similar products, since it spelled “Korean Rice Bowls” as “Corean Rice Bowls” (spelling “Korea” with a “C” rather an a “K” has distinctive nationalistic connotations, since the “K” spelling was only introduced in the early 20th Century by Japanese and English translators).
While other Korean food trucks offer many fusion options, Sura’s menu is more traditional (perhaps this is where the “C” comes in). You will find no tortillas on the menu, and each dish will be served with some juicy kimchi. This, however, should not deter potential customers from exploring many of the wonderful options Sura has to offer.
Sura’s menu is relatively simple, giving customers a choice of a meat dish (or vegetarian tofu) in two sizes, “bowl” or “cup.” In addition to barbecued meats, customers can also order Bibimbap, a traditional Korean rice dish, kimchi (fermented Chinese cabbage) fried rice, rice cake skewers, kimchi pancakes and traditional Korean meat patties.
Sura gives an ample amount of food for the price. Unlike some money-saving capitalists that will only serve minimal meat, filling the rest of the container space with cheaper rice, Sura generously supplies expertly cooked meat in all portions served.
Customer service was excellent. Not only was food prepared quickly, but the truck’s personnel were friendly and attentive. Tax is also included in the prices listed, so customers paying with cash can get nice big quarters back, as opposed to oftentimes cumbersome small change.
The Sura truck is not bereft of personal touches either. I was able to pick up a delicious “Inca Kola” for my drink, a hard-to-find-in-the-United-States product originally from Peru.
The Korean food truck market is one of rising competition, with already more well-established trucks like Kogi prominent. I support the Sura truck as a worthy competitor and a promising addition to the choices of food trucks appearing near USC.
 
The Sura Truck
Five stars
The truck can be found at Hoover and Jefferson at USC on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. A more complete schedule can be found here.

If you don’t have it already, you’ve sure seen others using it on your Facebook feed. Spotify has officially burst onto the scene in the United States thanks to a little help from the biggest social networking site on the planet.
Just a few weeks ago, you had to be somebody special to use Spotify, the European based internet music-streaming service. And for some reason, people were all over it. Despite similarities to last.fm and other basic streaming sites, Spotify had that extra dash of exclusivity and European flair.
But now that’s all over. Spotify no longer requires an invitation to join the massively popular website. Facebook, in its drive to have social networking be the focal point of everyone’s lives, has teamed up with Spotify to highlight the importance of music in human relations.
In order to create a Spotify account so that you can listen to basically any music you want via the Internet, all you have to do is press a “join” button — Facebook does the rest for you. Spotify takes all of your information — demographics, biographics, interests, even “likes”  — from your profile and uses this data to build your account.
There’s no denying this is a bit invasive. After a lot of press, questioning and social networking turmoil, it seems as though people are finally warming up to the idea of Facebook supplying Spotify with personal information — or at least accepting it.
Think what you will of this business partnership, but there’s no foreseeable end in sight. As Facebook prepares to integrate more and more of the Internet into its all-encompassing social services, more collaborations like this are sure to surface.
For now, take advantage of what you can. Spotify is only sharing its services with Facebook users without charge for six months. After the fact, users will have to pay $4.99 to access the service’s digitally transmitted music catalog.
[…] Facebook has a large and growing partner eco-system dying to start building applications on this powerful new graph infrastructure and contributing hugely valuable data. See interesting post from DailyTrojan entitled “Spotify & Facebook, Invasive or Innovative”. […]

Although many students typically flock to Koreatown for All You Can Eat Korean Barbecue, there are other Koreatown restaurants that serve food just as delectable and filling. All’ Angolo Pizza and Pasta, which opened Sept. 18, is one such restaurant.
Not to be confused with All’ Angelo on Melrose Avenue that closed down, All’ Angolo Pizza and Pasta adds a new neighborhood flavor to Koreatown. At first it might seem strange that an Italian restaurant is located in Koreatown. But considering most people travel to Koreatown only to eat AYCE and might not even consider trying other Korean foods, an Italian restaurant is an effective reminder of the other dishes and styles of food available there.
All’ Angolo Pizza and Pasta has already four raving reviews and a five star rating on Yelp. It also helps that the owner and chef, Alessandro Polastri, previously opened a popular Italian restaurant on Sunset called Amarone Kitchen + Wine, so the food at All’ Angolo Pizza and Pasta have a high-quality taste while still being affordable.
True to its name, All’ Angolo Pizza and Pasta really does hold many delicious dishes of pasta and different pizza combinations that scream Italian authenticity. The service and atmosphere here is cozy and it feels like a true pizzeria. The dough of the pizza is light and does not make you feel completely bloated afterwards and the sauces of the different pastas are packed with flavor.

USC’s Center for Body Computing has been working hard the last few months to create a new kind of technology that revolutionizes the way the public views sports.
The CBC is currently working on new sensors that wirelessly track vital statistics such as body heat, heart rate and perspiration in order to provide scientists, coaches and athletes with valuable information regarding the athlete’s performance.
The group even tested heart rate sensors on USC football players, monitoring them during a scrimmage that involved tackles, acceleration and other game-time maneuvers. This information will hopefully help scientists to establish more reliable baselines for what is normal and abnormal for both professional athletes and recreational gym-goers.
“This technology will change sports. We will soon enter a new era that will make the playing field safer, fans will have even more player information, and athletes will be able to play longer and be able to more easily avoid injury,” wrote Dr. Leslie Saxon for VentureBeat. “In a word, we believe bio sports stats will…become the next new trend in sports.”
In addition to helping create a safer playing field thanks to more information, biosensors will also allow players to perform better and avoid injury. Most athletic injuries can be traced back to fatigue, and this sensor technology is specifically designed to track vital signs and tip off trainers to early signs of fatigue in athletes.
Another major draw to this sensor system is the benefit to the fans. Sporting events do not allow for much in the way of real-time updating and technological interaction, while those watching at home are able to log onto their computers, change their fantasy rosters and even post updates on Twitter about their teams. Biosensors, on the other hand, could send fans specific new information about the players to enhance their viewing experience.
Biosensors will benefit players, coaches, spectators and investors. As Saxon writes, this new innovation will become “revolutionary in sports,” taking athletes and their performances to an entirely new level.

Senior All-American Kendall Bateman was named the Bank of the West Pac-12 Women’s Volleyball Offensive Player of the Week for the week of Sep. 19-25 after helping lead the volleyball team to wins over the two top-ranked teams in the country.
A setter, Bateman posted at least 40 assists in both 3-0 sweeps over then-ranked No. 1 California and No. 2 Stanford, averaging 13.83 assists per set.
The wins helped boost USC seven spots to No. 5 in this week’s AVCA Coaches poll after being ranked No. 12 last week.
Bateman played a big part in directing the offense in both wins.
The second team All-American had 42 assists, seven digs and two blocks against the top-ranked Bears on Friday before recording 41 assists, nine digs and one block against the Cardinal to run USC’s win streak to four matches.
Weekly awards are given to the best offensive player, defensive player and freshman in the Pac-12.
Bateman’s achievement marks the first time a USC player won any of the awards this season, which have been given out for five weeks now.
USC middle blocker Hannah Schraer was nominated for the Freshman of the Week award, but lost to UCLA middle blocker Zoe Nightingale.
UCLA outsider hitter Kelly Reeves won the Pac-12 defensive player of the week.

The USC women’s basketball eighth-ranked recruiting class received a welcome addition over the weekend as local prep star Kiki Alofaituli gave her commitment to head coach Michael Cooper.
Alofaituli, a 6’1″ forward from nearby powerhouse Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif., will bring a wealth of athleticism and defensive prowess to the court for the Women of Troy. The 26th-ranked high school player in the country will be reunited with Mater Dei teammate Alexyz Vaioletama this fall. Vaioletama and Alofaituli, along with Deanna Calhoun, Ariya Crook-Williams and Kate Oliver comprise Cooper’s highly ranked recruiting class.
Alofaituli originally committed to Arizona State and thus will not be eligible for the Women of Troy’s 2011-12 campaign. However, Alofaituli, a Tustin, Calif. resident, remains upbeat about the prospect of playing in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Cooper.
The Women of Troy will tip off the season Nov. 11 against Fresno State.

The set-up: USC traveled to Tempe, Ariz. for its first road test to play the Arizona State Sun Devils, who were fresh off of a loss against Illinois. With the two teams projected to finish near the top of the Pac-12 South in the preseason, the game figured have serious implications for divisions supremacy. Matt Barkley looked to continue his strong start to the season and atone for a poor performance the last time he went to Tempe. Meanwhile, while the Sun Devils looked to show that their defense was as good as advertised.
The story: The Trojans fell behind early to the Sun Devils on a 70 yard touchdown run by Cameron Marshall. Freshman kicker Andre Heidari closed the margin by kicking a field goal to make the score 7-3 at the end of the first.
In the second quarter, ASU quarterback Brock Osweiler threw two short touchdown passes, while Trojan quarterback Matt Barkley threw a costly interception inside of the Devil’s 25-yard line to fierce linebacker Vontaze Burfict. Heidari kicked two more field goals to make the score 21-9 at the half.
The Trojans came out firing in the second half, and at times looked unstoppable. Barkley threw a 24-yard touchdown pass to freshman receiver Marqise Lee to make the score 21-16. The Trojans came up with a defensive stop and once again marched down the field. The drive was capped off by a Marc Tyler touchdown run, giving USC the lead, 22-21.
Just as things started to turn for the better, the Trojans became their own worst enemies. A pass interference call allowed the Devils to score again, and a Tyler fumble on the next drive at ASU’s 25-yard line killed momentum.
The fourth quarter saw Barkley fumble the ball inside of ASU’s 20-yard line and throw an interception that was taken back for a touchdown. Things never got back on track for the Trojans and they ended up losing by a final margin of 43-22.
Turnovers, turnovers, turnovers: USC ended any chances they had at a comeback in the game by committing costly turnovers in Sun Devil territory. Three of the Trojans four turnovers occurred inside of the Sun Devil 30-yard line. In the first half, USC scored only six points on three red zone trips. Lane Kiffin summed it up best after the loss. “A lot of mistakes and issues with guys that haven’t really played too much,” he said.
Penalties Galore: The Trojans were guilty of 10 penalties, each of which seemed to give ASU life once again. Safety T.J. McDonald committed three personal fouls himself, each at a seemingly terrible time.
Up Next: The Trojans play host to the Arizona Wildcats (1-3) this coming Saturday at 12:30 PM at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum. Arizona is in the middle of a brutal stretch of games that included No. 5 Stanford and No. 10 Oregon.
