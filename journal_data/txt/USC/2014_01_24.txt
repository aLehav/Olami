Whether for taking notes, writing papers or just wasting time in class, it is generally accepted that a laptop is a necessary tool for survival in the modern classroom.
Most students searching for a new computer before or during college decide between Apple’s Macbook line or a range of machines running the latest Windows. But for students who are looking for a computer that can meet all their needs without a USC bookstore price, Google’s Chromebook may be the answer.
Chromebooks, available from a number of PC manufacturers like Samsung and Acer for as little as $199, run Google’s Chrome operating system, which is essentially the Chrome web browser with a few built-in web apps. It utilizes Google Cloud, so you don’t have to worry about losing your files or backing things up. You’ll have to forget your grand plans of simultaneously writing ten papers while directing US military satellites from your dorm, but in this case, less is more.
All of the needs of the typical students are accommodated by Google’s range of productivity tools. Need to write a paper or take notes?  Google Docs allows you to not only create word documents, but to easily collaborate with others — an excellent tool for creating group study guides. In addition to Docs, Google’s office suites includes tools for creating spreadsheets and slideshows, comparable to Excel and PowerPoint.
Want to listen to music? You can buy songs through the Google Play store or sync your iTunes library, then listen through the Cloud. And for your typical time-wasting activities, the Chrome browser is lightweight and fast. After a few weeks of use, the battery life is still sufficient to manage a full day of classes.
The Chromebook does have its limitations. The Chrome OS means Mac or PC software can’t be installed, and the lack of processing power makes it a no-go for students doing high-level design or editing work. But, for the average student just looking for a computer to occasionally work on, the Chromebook is a cheap, cost-effective option that is definitely worth taking a look at. Just think, you’ll never have to explain to the folks how your $1200 Macbook was stolen because you didn’t take DPS’s advice and lock it while sleeping in the library.

Traditional dating may be on its way out, but one of key element will never go out of vogue: the first dinner date. The saying, “You can get to a man’s heart through his stomach,” is, for the most part, true. But, gentlemen, that works for the ladies too. Because first impressions are everything, here are the top 10 don’ts of dining on a first date:
1.  Anything with garlic – Scaring away a date is not something that should be accomplished because of bad breath. Garlic is all well and good when you’re with your friends or family, but seeing someone of interest, like a boss or possible future significant other, is not okay – those people should encounter the breath of death only once they are stuck in the relationship. If garlic is a must, then you both must consume it.
2.  Mexican food, specifically with beans – “Beans, beans, the magical fruit, the more you eat, the more you toot…” Absolutely not. Imagine a first date at a concert – it’s loud, so the concert takes care of one aspect, but close proximity to others is a thing – beware the beans. Tacos, chips and salsa, enchiladas, tamales, tortas and sopes are all great options, just hold the beans. Don’t discount BBQ baked beans, because all beans have the same effect.
3.  Salad, or leafy forkfuls of death – Ladies, eating leafy greens and maintaining a slim figure is great when not on a date. Lettuce is difficult to consume and look “cute” while doing so; save the physical exhaustion, the blushing and embarrassing giggles that are attempting to muffle the massive amount of green being devoured, and order something where smaller bites are required. In reference to Amanda Bynes’ She’s the Man, “Violet, chew like you have a secret.” See also: Larger-than-life sandwiches
4.  Ethiopian food – Cultural excursions make some of the best dates, but pick one that won’t leave you in the restaurant bathroom for longer than two minutes. Complete respect to the Ethiopian culture for mastering large quantities of vegan and vegetarian food, as well as savory chicken, but there have been quite a few instances that have resulted in explosive experiences.
5. Spicy food, if you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen – Spicy food is self-explanatory. Ladies, don’t melt the makeup job, and gents, don’t sweat through button downs – not cute.
6.  Anything with hard-core onion, like French onion soup – Raw or cooked, sautéed or fried, onions are a great source of fiber and have amazing flavor. Unfortunately, raw onions, apart from being delicious, cause bad breath, so be careful.
7.  Anything super fishy – If both parties enjoy a good oyster bar, by all means, go. And some atmospheric seaside ambiance is a lovely touch, but sometimes less is more, and the smell of the sea is always more romantic than a fresh slab of raw halibut.  
8.  Food you haven’t tried before – When eating out, it is easy to figure out what you will like and what you won’t based on previous experience, so make sure that you are smart in regards to choosing a great location.
9.  Larger-than-life sandwiches, sandwiches that require a pie hole larger than necessary – If you need to open your mouth as wide as a basking shark in order to fit the sandwich in, you’re not doing something right. This includes, large burgers, layered subs and po-boys.
10.  Messy foods – Included are BBQ ribs, chicken and any super saucy finger foods. BBQ is a huge one, because the restaurants never seem to provide enough napkins and wipes to get rid of the smell of hickory smoked ribs or the stickiness of the brown sugar-baked corn cake, but it is delicious.
Make sure that the person you choose to date learns your eating habits and appreciates who you are. There is nothing worse than a significant other who can’t appreciate a little bit of leftovers on your chin.

I think overly focusing on external appearances to create an atmosphere so devoid of the reality of who you are makes for the worst possible start for something that ought to be built on truth and trust. 
There’s a neglected (but important, nonetheless) beauty in witnessing and appreciating the human reality in a potential partner that a large percentage of your dating advice seeks to conceal. It’s little surprise why relationships that begin with sterile, artificial appearances end disastrously for so many superficial people these days.

The No. 6 USC women’s tennis team will have its home opener Friday at Marks Stadium as USC hosts ITA Kick-off Weekend. Throughout the month of January, the team began the spring season playing in various tournaments across the U.S., specifically in Las Vegas, Nev., Palm Springs, Calif. and Port St. Lucie, Fla. Playing at home will be a nice change of pace as USC welcomes opposing teams St. Mary’s, Utah and North Texas for the weekend tournament.
Juniors Giuliana Olmos and Zoe Scandalis started their spring season on the right foot by taking home the doubles title at the Freeman Memorial Tennis Championships in Las Vegas (WHEN?). The duo is ranked seventh in the nation together. Senior Brynn Boren and freshman Zoë Katz, ranked No. 3 in the nation together, were upset by an unranked pair from Duke.
Meanwhile, junior Gabriella DeSimone, senior Kaitlyn Christian and sophomore Ellie Yates participated in the National Collegiate Tennis Classic in Palm Springs. After making a deep run in the tournament, junior Gabriella DeSimone said the team is ready to bring their success back to their home court.
“We are excited to kick off the season off at home. Every match is a chance for us to get better and build more confidence and that is what we are aiming for this weekend,” DeSimone said. “Playing at home is fantastic. Home court advantage always helps and being able to keep certain rituals. Also, being able to sleep in your own bed is always a plus.”
In the first round of the ITA Kick-off Weekend tournament, USC will face a solid squad in No. 60 North Texas, led by head coach Sujay Lama. The Mean Green fell this past weekend to No. 34-ranked Oklahoma and is looking to rebound against the Women of Troy. The team played last weekend without Kseniya Bardabush and Franziska Sprinkmeyer, and may have to again today.
When asked how she and fellow teammates are preparing for an unfamiliar opponent in North Texas, DeSimone said she’s preparing for this team the same way she does for all opponents.
“I am looking at North Texas just like any other match,” DeSimone said. “I don’t pay much attention to the school or the individual I will be playing against but mainly what I need to do to get myself ready to compete this weekend.”
The other match today will feature No. 37 St. Mary’s, led by Jenny Jullien, versus No. 58 Utah and top player Tereza Bekerova. Both St. Mary’s and Utah could provide intriguing singles and doubles matchups against USC in the second round of play, but DeSimone guarantees that USC is focusing on North Texas and not looking ahead to a potential match with Pac-12 conference rivals Utah, whom USC will face later during the season in conference play.
“As for potentially facing Utah, I am not looking that far ahead,” DeSimone said. “[I’m taking it] one match at a time for now, so my focus is all geared towards North Texas for now.”
The tournament will start today at 10 a.m. with Utah versus St. Mary’s, followed by USC versus North Texas at 1 p.m. The tournament will conclude on Sat., Jan. 25, with a consolation match at 2 p.m. and the championship match at 5 p.m. All games will be played outdoors at Marks Stadium.
Fantastic article.  Well written and very informative!
Great article!  See you at Marks Stadium!
Awesome article!

Stephen Sondheim, the legendary composer/lyricist, does not disappoint in his often-overlooked musical, Merrily We Roll Along. Neither do the students of Musical Theater Repertory, who opened the production last night at USC’s Massman Theater. Known as one of Sondheim’s most “famous flops” after closing on Broadway with just 40 performances under its belt, USC students did a commendable job of bringing the show back to life.
Sondheim is known for creating difficult and complex melodies, and the show itself could be described in the same manner. The story is told backward, with frequent musical interludes indicating a new year, usually two to three years prior. If this sounds confusing, that’s because it is. Luckily, the production does a fine job reminding viewers of the current year with a projection on the clock-shaped proscenium.

The show tells the story of Frank, Charlie and Mary, a composer, playwright and author — respectively — who have fallen out of friendship following Frank’s massive success as a film producer.
As the show moves backwards, important moments in Frank’s life are highlighted, and the audience is slowly able to piece together the relationships and story.
The show premiered in 1981 and takes place from 1957-1976, but its themes of friendship, tenacity and perseverance are as timeless as the melodies. At times hopeful, at times funny and at times just depressing, the format offers small slices of life from the existence of one man. The most painful part of watching this show is realizing how earnestly Frank started out in his career, but all the while knowing how things have spiraled out of control just five, ten and twenty years down the road. The characters in the final scene and the characters in the first scene hardly seem like the same people.
The props, set and costumes, but luckily they do not overshadow the music, as musical director Anthony Lucca was still able to score a wonderful blend of instruments and voices.
Sondheim’s music demands accompaniment of the highest quality and the jazzy nine-piece orchestra does not go unnoticed. The harmonies are equally well done, especially in group numbers such as “Opening Doors” and “Now You Know.”
Sometimes Sondheim and the actors get a bit ahead of themselves, and it is easy to tell the performers are in over their heads. But moments like these are rare, and forgiven due to the excellence of most other songs.
Some particularly shining musical moments also include “Franklin Shepard, Inc,” performed by Charlie (Myles Nuzzi). Nuzzi miraculously stayed on top of the beat of this fast-paced song, and instantly had the audience moving along with him.
Solos by Jennifer Kranz (Beth), Claire Adams (Mary) and Bella Hicks (Gussie) were proof that student vocalists are nothing to shake a stick at. Commanding, powerful and skilled, all three ladies easily commanded the audience’s attention whenever they were on stage.
Though the singing is spectacular, more care should have been taken with the acting and choreography by student director Brandon Baer. Much of the choreography felt very stiff and purposeless, which could have been due to Sondheim’s writing. The opening number was particularly lackluster, which set the precedent for the rest of the show. By placing the actors in straight, unmoving lines, the audience is given no hint to the relationships to the bored-looking characters.
Similarly, instead of fighting the static repetition of the “Transition” numbers, Baer allowed the actors to simply stand still, which made the transitions feel like mere space fillers, as opposed to something genuinely necessary to the production.
Stronger acting was also something to be desired from much of the performers, especially — and equally unfortunately — the leading man Franklin Shepard, played by Taubert Nadalini. Nadalini was disappointingly stiff and emotionless and seemed like an awkward teenager for much of the production, which luckily came in handy as the production went on and the character became closer to his own age. Ironically, he seemed more confident and mature when he played the younger Frank, but this likely comes from the insecurity of playing a 40-year-old man.
Many other performances were either equally stiff, or obnoxiously over-played. This can likely be attributed to the maturity and difficulty of the production itself, and perhaps a few more live audiences will help the actors settle into the right performance. Regardless of the sometimes-shaky acting, the music and singing were still phenomenal, and made this Sondheim classic a recommended viewing.
The show runs through Sunday, and tickets are available through uscmtr.com.
