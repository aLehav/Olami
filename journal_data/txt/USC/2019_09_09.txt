President Carol Folt announced Monday that Athletic Director Lynn Swann resigned from his position. Swann had served as athletic director since 2016.
“Lynn has been a leader on and off the field at USC for nearly five decades, and he will forever be a valued member of the Trojan family,” Folt wrote in an email to the USC community.
Folt also stated that special adviser to the president Dave Roberts, who currently serves as the NCAA’s Vice Chair of the Committee on Infractions, will fill the athletic director role in the interim. He has been the vice president of athletics compliance at the University since 2010. 
Folt said Roberts’ experience as a student-athlete at UC Davis, understanding of collegiate athletics and legal background make him a well-qualified candidate.
“I think you probably know by now that I always start from the students and think about the student-athletes,” Folt told the Daily Trojan. “And, as we look forward to the next athletic director, having that strong perspective of student-athletes is really important … I couldn’t have a person better poised to think about what are the things that an athletic department needs to be to be a great athletic department in the next year, five years, 10 years.”
Roberts told the Daily Trojan that his first step will be to talk to coaches, administrators and student-athletes in the coming weeks to find out what the department can change and improve. He said his ultimate priorities are to set things up for the next athletic director and ensure that student-athletes have the best experience possible.
“Being on the Committee on Infractions, [has] allowed me to do is see what the cutting-edge issues are with sports today, so I can bring that information back to my colleagues at USC, and we can take actions that are going to have us be avoiding problems in the future,” Roberts said.
Folt also announced the members of a search committee that will be in charge of finding a permanent replacement. The committee is chaired by Trustee Suzanne Nora Johnson.
It includes alumni representative Bill Allen, Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp, Faculty Athletics Representative Alan Green, Academic Senate President Rebecca Lonergan, Provost Charles Zukoski, Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso and trustees Jeff Smulyan and William McMorrow. 
Folt added that the committee will include two student-athletes yet to be named. She told the Daily Trojan that she is drawing on positive experiences from including two students on her provost search committee.
“I think the main reason I decided to [include student-athletes] is that my experience has always told me that when you can involve students in decisions that are very pertinent to them, you’re going to get a much better outcome,” Folt said. “So I’m looking for an athletic director that is really helping us build a very strong student-centered focus.”
Swann’s resignation comes four days after a Los Angeles Times report revealed that USC alumnus B. Wayne Hughes Sr., founder of self-storage company Public Storage and a good friend of Swann’s, donated almost $400 million to the University from 2010-15, just before Swann took over as athletic director. The article also reported that Swann was given “a seat on the corporate board of a Hughes company, American Homes 4 Rent, and directorship on the board of Hughes’ charity,” and that Hughes donated over $165,000 to Swann’s 2006 campaign for governor in Pennsylvania.
Swann, a former USC wide receiver, came under fire for multiple scandals in the athletic department during his tenure. His resignation comes just months after USC’s involvement in the college admissions scheme, in which the FBI found that former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel and former water polo coach Jovan Vavic received bribes to falsely identify prospective students as recruits, and two years after the FBI arrested former men’s assistant basketball coach Tony Bland for his role in the college basketball bribery scandal.
With all the problems that happened under Swann’s supervision, some were surprised at the timing of the decision. Folt said there is no single appropriate time for a dramatic overhaul due to the ever-changing nature of the athletics department.
“Each sport has a different ebb and flow, but right now all of our fall sports are really set, they’re all going, things are going really well, things are in a really good situation,” she said. “And in a few months, we’re going to start looking to winter sports, and we’re going to be doing more recruiting and more building, so in a way this is a very good time because it allows me to select an athletics director that’s going to be the person all those new people will want to meet.”
Both Folt and Roberts said they’re excited with the direction of the department.
“Our Athletics Department puts our student-athletes first by pursuing excellence with integrity,” Folt wrote in her announcement email. “We will build on the traditions and strengths of our exceptional athletics program.”

“It feels like Christmas morning.” 
Gathered outside the Shrine Auditorium, waiting for the ushers to throw open the doors, there was, indeed, an excited energy to the crowd. The anticipation in the air was palpable — the kind of anticipation where you know you’re about to secure a lot of shit you really, really want. 
Cosmetics retailer Sephora’s two-day beauty extravaganza, Sephoria, took place over the weekend at the Shrine. 75 brands participated in the massive festival, billed as the “Coachella of beauty.” The festival gave participants a chance to score new limited-edition products, meet their favorite makeup artists and influencers, get free full-face makeovers and load their camera rolls with enough content to last a month. 
As the crowd swarmed into the hall, they were greeted by a line of tents, a shiny playground extending as far as the eye could see. Brands were grouped together in sections, loosely based on category: makeup, skincare or fragrance.  
The pop-up exhibit aesthetic was in full force at Sephoria, heartily embraced by every brand in attendance. Crammed into close quarters, each booth jockeyed to outdo its neighbor and earn the free advertising that accompanies an appearance on your Instagram page. Neon signs, sparkly disco balls, flashing strobe lights — nothing was too garish or too gauche. 
Some sections had the help of a schtick. In the Glam Game Room, brands such as Nudestixcks and Kaja filled claw machines with lipstick samples and heart-shaped sunglasses (but no worries if you failed to get anything, as representatives were quick to hand you a consolation prize anyway). In the Garden section, greenhouse-inspired beauty ruled. Farmacy filled its space with Claes Oldenburg-esque oversized cherries; Gucci made liberal use of pampas grass; Innisfree shrouded an entire wall in verdant vines. In the Home Spa, clean beauty brands such as Bite Beauty and Herbivore Botanicals cozied up with crystals and succulents, showing off their paraben-free, sulfate-free Sephora Green Leaf Stamp of Approval. 
Other brands were merely separated into color-coded neighborhoods and left to fend for themselves. Some honorable mentions are Fenty Beauty’s lip gloss carousel, Tatcha’s miniature bamboo forest and Charlotte Tilbury’s Broadway marquee lights. And, of course, the surefire method for attracting a crowd, eye candy: Patrick Ta, Huda Beauty and Sol de Janeiro all hired shirtless studs to pose for pictures. 
“This is literally like Disneyland,” I heard someone say as they walked past me, and the comparison is apt. Throughout the entire time I was there, I didn’t stop to sit down once, too worried that I’d miss something, some once-in-a-lifetime experience. I willingly lingered in long lines, positive that the two-minute encounter at the end would be worth the 20-minute wait. 
For four hours, I lapped it all up. I snapped selfies. I eagerly surrendered to the capable hands of beautiful women who knew what they were doing when they brushed glitter onto my eyelids and sprayed oil in my hair. I let myself be swept along and convinced of the magical properties of CBD-infused lotion. I needed it; I needed everything, or at least, I needed a free sample of everything. 
Only at the very end, with five minutes to spare, did I find a seat, satisfied that I’d wrung every last drop of — enjoyment? value? — from Sephoria. I was exhausted; my feet hurt from all the walking. Little girls streaked by, shrieking to the Ariana Grande blasting through the loudspeakers. Someone slipped out from behind a curtain, and I strained to catch a peek — just stacks and stacks of cardboard boxes. 
So that was Sephoria, then, behind the glamorous fantasy: lots of boxes. Ultimately, it was a picture-perfect facade designed to sell you something — a vision of beauty, a vision of perfection, a vision of happiness once beauty and perfection had been attained, preferably through a $150 eye cream. 
There was one more perk to be redeemed as the festival wound down. As festival-goers shuffled toward the exit, Sephora representatives doled out swag bags laden with goodies. General admission ticket holders received bags containing around $250 worth of products. VIP ticket holders walked out with a bag valued at $900. I took it and wondered when I was going to use all this.

When I think of summer, I think of endless sunny days, freedom from the everyday mundane routines and time to explore new avenues of self-expression. While some may have had such a picturesque season, I, on the other hand, had a summer lived through the internet (not as boring as it sounds, I promise). And as summer comes to a close, what do I have to say about social media? Frankly, I’m over it.
I mean, not entirely, but hear me out.
To clarify, no, I didn’t just spend the entire summer switching between scrolling through Instagram or Twitter on my phone (that would have been quite boring). Overall, I had a great summer filled with its pockets of adventure. I was in Los Angeles with my friends, I spent many weekends on the beach and I had my dream internship at an influencer marketing company. With all of those activities in mind, though, my work life and my personal life converged digitally. When I wasn’t posting about my own whereabouts, I was at a 9-to-5 where I had to critically think about brands and their relevance as they pertain to consumption via influencers.
Don’t get me wrong — I loved my job. I felt like I had spent my whole life preparing to discuss my knowledge of the social media sphere with like-minded professionals. But what was once a passion quickly watered down to simply being my everyday. 
To some degree, I liked the hivemind setting, as up until that point I had seldom found so many professional mentors who took a vested interest in being as serious about the field as I am. I watched YouTube videos as I worked — as did everyone else — only to turn around to my co-worker to spill the latest influencer tea. Later, I’d go to a meeting with a client to discuss how their campaign was doing in relation to how their social posts were performing on various platforms. The next day, I sat in on a trend report that laid out how the digitally-native Gen-Z population (me!) functions socially and as consumers. I was captivated by all of it, and I left every day feeling like a starry-eyed kid who, with the light from her phone screen reflecting in her eyes, had just been told all of her wildest dreams could come true.
Then I would go home, go to the gym (sometimes), hang out with friends, lay in bed, keep on scrolling and repeat.
My last column from Fall 2018 touched upon the dangers of intersecting one’s personal and digital lives too much, but instead of experiencing that from the influencer side, I got a good look from the outside-in on the management side. If the goal of this column is to dive deep into how the online world plays an active role in shaping our everyday lives, then my internship was the manifestation of just that. I pulled engagement rates on various influencer posts. I assisted talent at VidCon (the highlight of my summer, easily) and observed a brand activation I worked on come to life. I finessed my way into all the big influencer parties and watched David Dobrik bounce around filming his vlog. Simply put, it felt like my life had turned into one big YouTube video.
On the last night of VidCon, I had managed to secure the VIP of VIP wristbands to the biggest influencer party, where on the upper level of the House of Blues Anaheim I was rubbing elbows with all of the creators I admired growing up. As I looked over the balcony at a scene that looked oddly reminiscent of a USC frat party, I thought to myself, I’ve really made it. I had managed to be exactly where I wanted and more. But when I stepped back, I couldn’t help but still feel like something was missing. I was in limbo — present in a space that was relevant digitally, but beyond that, where was its merit?
During my internship, my company released a report titled “The Social Media Hangover,” which expanded upon how 51% of Gen-Z and Millennials dream of a life without social media. Ever since, I’ve been stuck on the word hangover when describing my tolerance for social media because, per the association of the word, I’ve had a hard time stomaching it lately. When I open my phone and scroll through Instagram, the intrigue is lost almost immediately. I can barely sit through a YouTube video anymore. Even the self-deprecating humor on Twitter that usually gets a laugh out of me isn’t doing it. 
But I’m okay with that. Instead, I’ve allowed my attention to turn inward, allowing me to contemplate who I am independent of social media: manifesting that outward by spending time with loved ones and tackling what physical life has to throw at me.
I was hesitant about continuing this column for a third semester because, despite my love for social media, my digital hangover made me feel that the whole subject was trivial and ready to be tossed. Even though I’m not presently as inundated with social media as I had been for the past three months, I must acknowledge that world is still out there and more powerful than ever. But I write about this subject mindfully, because while discussing TikTok, Instagram and YouTube in this space is all business, there are more things to see, scandals to be had and changes to be made. How we will relate our real lives online, then, will only continue to unfold as life churns on ahead.
I invite you to join me on my journey to find my digital balance throughout this semester. Welcome back to Internet Cultured.

California’s housing crisis has remained a hot-button topic since the 1970s. Almost 25% of Americans who are affected by homelessness live in California. For a state that only contains 12.5% of the nation’s citizens, this is absurdly disproportionate. 
On his campaign trail, Gov. Gavin Newsom promised to expand housing, create affordable homes in affordable areas and make a dent in the housing crisis. And since his election, he has started to take action that upholds his promise. In overruling a lowball housing plan for Southern California and instead demanding the construction of 1.3 million homes within the next decade, Newsom is forcing California in a direction of positive change.
Those who thought Newsom was full of empty promises on the campaign trail insist that he is again making a promise without a clear plan for execution. But he has taken one of the most important steps toward launching a project of this magnitude — his January budget proposal allocates over $2 billion for affordable housing. The governor should not be required to outline all the nitty gritty details of his plan. Instead, he should be able to lean on local governments to execute it.
Addressing the housing deficit has always been a tug of war between state and local government — officials like Newsom set high numbers, but city and county governments push back, having difficulties dividing the funding as they lack resources or plainly do not want to create more housing. 
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), a group of city- and county-elected officials in the area, estimated Southern California needs only 430,000 homes by 2029. A 2016 report by McKinsey, a national development consulting firm, stated that there needs to be 3.5 million more houses in Southern California by 2025 to accommodate the growing population. A more conservative estimate was made in a 2018 USC research report, which said 2.5 million was a better estimate for the same timeframe. Both of these numbers are far higher than SCAG was willing to plan for. 
Because SCAG underestimated California’s population growth, it’s likely the housing crisis would only worsen if its original housing plan was upheld. The two million homes unaccounted for between SCAG and USC’s estimates translate even more people who may have been affected by homelessness.
SCAG and local governments aren’t innocent of evading housing development — though the private sector does the actual construction, local leaders have a slow growth mindset when it comes to zoning for housing. They often succumb to Not In My Backyard groups, also known as NIMBYs, who oppose developments near them, in fear of larger populations, crime, homelessness or various other social issues that will be “in their backyards.”
So rather than planning for development, local governments try to preserve certain kinds of cities — single family homes, minimized traffic and suburbs. But because of Newsom’s plan, this won’t carry on for much longer. Cities will be denser, more affordable housing will be created and those who are experiencing homelessness will hopefully have somewhere to live.
In the wake of Newsom’s overrule of Southern California’s long-term zoning plan, NIMBYs have emerged far and wide in protest — and some make very good points. A collection of letters to the editor in response to the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board’s support of Newsom’s housing plan touch on transportation and public transit, earthquake readiness and stimulating job development.
But these issues must be taken in stride — Newsom’s plan will unfold over the next decade. In tandem, Los Angeles will develop transportation for its Metro Vision 2028 plan. Developers can look to densifying housing around urban centers and transit hubs. Perhaps the feared traffic increase will promote public transit ridership and benefit the environment in the long run. But change cannot start without a goal and a leader, and Newsom has shouldered the responsibility.
Newsom’s plan is what California needs to turn the tide on our housing crisis. And as citizens, we need to show up and elect leaders like Newsom who prioritize these issues. But we also need to ask our local leaders to show up. For SCAG’s original ruling of 430,000 new homes, only one of L.A. County’s council members was present to vote. Even Mayor Eric Garcetti, a SCAG board member, was not present. Change is enacted locally, and it starts with us saying “yes” in our backyards.

After splitting their first road trip 1-1, No. 15 USC women’s volleyball lost two out of three matches this weekend at the University of Northern Iowa tournament. The Women of Troy felt the absence of All-American senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier and senior opposite Emily Baptista.
The Trojans fell to No. 12 Kentucky in their first match of the weekend. Kentucky was 2-2 entering the match after its loss to Creighton earlier that day.
Lacking the power of Lanier, USC failed to efficiently score off kills. 
Kentucky had 63 kills during the game compared to just 40 for the Trojans. Junior outside hitter Brooke Botkin led the Trojans offensively with 14 kills.
The Trojans opened the first set by dropping 4 straight points. Kentucky was able to get the Trojans out of sync and pulled away after USC briefly held a 13-12 lead. The Wildcats wrapped up the first set with a 25-18 score. 
The second set of the match saw head coach Brent Crouch use all three of his challenges and win two of them. While the referees were reviewing the calls, both the Kentucky and USC benches competed in a dance off. 
The set was closely contested, but Kentucky won 25-22 and took a 2-0 lead.
Down 24-21 in the third set, USC had its back up against the wall and faced a potential sweep. Sparked by a cross court kill by Botkin and helped by a service ace, USC came back, stole the set and extended the game. 
But that would be the only spark the injury-riddled team could muster as Kentucky closed the match in a dominant fourth set. The Wildcats jumped out to a 12-7 lead and never looked back. 
The Trojans constantly played out of system, as they were unable to pass efficiently. Kentucky seemed to target freshman outside hitter Kalen Owes, as she received the ball over 40 times in the game. 
In the second matchup of the tournament, USC defeated Northern Iowa in four sets. Owes put up an impressive 15 kills during the match and lead the team with 20 points scored. Sophomore setter Raquel Lázaro posted the Trojans’ first triple-double in the 25-point scoring era. Lázaro had 11 blocks, 16 digs and 36 sets. 
The two teams were tied 13 times during the match. USC came back from as many as 6 points down several times, using multiple long runs to help steal the match. 
USC made 21.5 blocks against UNI — the team’s highest total since 2014 — improving its all-time record against Northern Iowa to 7-1. 
To finish off the weekend, USC lost to No. 23 Creighton for the first time in seven contests between the two schools. 
Though no set was decided by more than 5 points, the Trojans were only able to win one frame. 
Botkin secured her second double-double of the year with 12 kills and 11 digs. Freshman outside hitter Emilia Weske also had an impressive day against Creighton with 15 kills, seven digs, four blocks and an ace. Lázaro totaled 47 assists in the weekend’s last match. 
Although USC fought hard, it was not able to come back from a deficit of 8 points in the last set. The Trojans trimmed the lead to 23-20, but it proved to be too little, too late. 
USC’s weekend moved it to 2-3 on the season. The Trojans have faced three ranked opponents early on in the season, but have come up empty handed in all those matches. 
Next, the Trojans return home to the Galen Center for their first home games of the season as Yale, Howard and Villanova come to town for the Trojan Invitational.

One of the biggest storylines heading into Saturday night’s annual USC-Stanford matchup was that both teams would be playing without their starting quarterbacks. The Trojans’ sophomore JT Daniels suffered a season-ending knee injury against Fresno State the previous week, while Stanford senior K.J. Costello missed the game due to a head injury. Replacing them were freshman Kedon Slovis and junior Davis Mills, respectively, and although Mills was thought to have the edge due to his (relative) experience, it was Slovis who emerged as the breakout star in USC’s dominant 45-20 victory.
Slovis completed 28 of 33 passes for 377 yards and three touchdowns on the night, but the statistics might not have been the most impressive part of his performance. His arm talent was on full display, whether he was dropping a 39-yard touchdown right in sophomore receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown’s bread basket or lasering a 31-yard pass on a dime to redshirt junior receiver Tyler Vaughns past defenders on the sideline. 
But Slovis also demonstrated a level of poise you wouldn’t expect from a true freshman who came in as an afterthought three-star recruit in USC’s underwhelming 2019 class. He seemed much calmer than the older Mills, who missed a few crucial throws to open targets throughout the game.
The freshman was good enough to impress new offensive coordinator Graham Harrell, which isn’t an easy task. Harrell, a historically good quarterback during his time at Texas Tech, recognizes all the minute details that go into being great at the position and was known during his time at North Texas for getting on signal-callers for the smallest mistakes. Even he couldn’t find much that Slovis did wrong.
“Almost every throw, where I thought the ball should go, it went,” Harrell said. “If you do that with the other guys around him, you got a chance to be really good and put up great numbers.”
The freshman got plenty of help; the maligned offensive line gave him great time, and his dynamic group of receivers got consistent separation from a Stanford secondary that thoroughly dominated Northwestern last week. And although the defense couldn’t stop Stanford for much of the first half, USC held the Cardinal scoreless in the second half, featuring crucial plays like redshirt sophomore nickel back Greg Johnson’s fourth quarter interception and junior offensive tackle Austin Jackson’s blocked kick in the third quarter. If it weren’t for Slovis, sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin, who made multiple acrobatic pass breakups, would have been USC’s most impressive player.
There was a different energy to this USC team, starting with that second quarter when it overcame a 17-3 deficit to lead 24-20 at halftime. Between a defense that couldn’t get a stop and a lost fumble by redshirt junior receiver Velus Jones Jr. on a kickoff with USC down 14-3, the first quarter brought back memories of the frustrating, tear-your-hair-out losses that personified the 2018 season.
But then Griffin came up with two huge pass breakups covering junior tight end Colby Parkinson, forcing Stanford to kick a field goal. That was a small victory that the team needed, and it boosted USC into that scoring drive that ended with the long touchdown to St. Brown. From there the Trojans were off and running, using a 42-3 run to blow the Cardinal out of the building. Now it was Stanford drawing similarities to last season’s USC team — the Cardinal were uncharacteristically sloppy and appeared unsure how to respond when the Trojans started punching them in the mouth.
The new dynamic this USC team brought was resilience. Last year’s team would have folded after everything that went wrong in the first quarter, but Slovis led the charge for a group that was unperturbed by adversity. Redshirt sophomore center Brett Neilon said that Slovis gathered the offense on the sideline following Jones’ fumble and showcased the calmness under fire that has impressed teammates and coaches since spring camp.
“[He said] ‘No matter what happens on the field, when the offense hits it we’re going to score, and we’re going to do our thing,’” Neilon said. “That was pretty impressive for a younger guy to do that.”
This is no more than conjecture, but I think it helped that the face of the comeback wasn’t around for all those blown opportunities in 2018. I don’t want to kick Daniels while he’s down because he was quite good in his one half of play against Fresno State, but I can’t help but feel as though the team wouldn’t have reached the level it did if the sight of its signal-caller recalled last season’s debacles.
Slovis is part of a group of young players like Griffin, St. Brown and sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga that has a chance to help USC move past the self-destructive tendencies of last season. The most frustrating part about 2018 wasn’t the win-loss record, it was the fact that the team beat itself repeatedly and in the most predictable fashion possible. USC couldn’t handle success or failure, and it had no answer when things went wrong. It’s unreasonable to ask Slovis to repeat Saturday night’s performance every week, but it isn’t too much to expect USC not to shoot itself in the foot with turnovers, dumb penalties and a lack of execution.
We’ll see where this team goes. One game is a small sample size, and everything can come crashing down if USC loses at BYU or gets smashed by Utah at home. Any team relying on so many young players is sure to experience some growing pains, but that youth movement also presents a chance at a fresh start. If USC can continue to respond to adversity like it did Saturday night, Trojan fans should feel better no matter the team’s final record this season.

For many college students living on a budget, high fashion clothing and accessories aren’t a part of their daily look. But Kikay, an earring business created by two Iovine and Young Academy students, aims to change this narrative.
The business’ tagline says it all: “Being extra shouldn’t cost extra.” IYA sophomores Ysabella Delgado and Quinn Jones wanted to create an accessory line that encouraged people to be bold, while still being affordable. Prices for Kikay earrings range from $10 to $18. 
The two students were able to showcase samples they had worked on and talk to potential customers when a friend invited them to a concert with artists and vendors showcasing their work. After hearing positive feedback at the show, they started an Instagram page for Kikay and turned their ideas into an e-commerce business by selling their jewelry on Shopify.
Kikay, a Tagalog word meaning “girly girl,” is a reflection of Delgado’s Filipino culture. She wanted to draw from her background to create a brand that was true to its name.
“I am Filipino, so I was coming back to my family,” Delgado said. “I wanted to pick a name that was reflective of where my family is from.”
Using her experience as a makeup artist and photographer, Delgado wanted to draw design ideas from the makeup industry as she believes that the earrings people wear should complement their outfits and makeup.  
“One of our goals as a brand is to not only produce things that people want to wear but also to kind of create like the perfect topper to a creative look,” Delgado said. “So with our Instagram marketing, one of our goals is to also send [our products] out to a variety of artists so that they can use our earrings in their way.”
Drawing inspiration from ColourPop Cosmetics’ fruit line, Kikay’s first line features fruit earrings: large cherries, oranges, lemons and apples, among other food items. Delgado and Jones are also partnering with other IYA students to create a line inspired by the Area 51 raid, a viral Facebook event that was created this past summer in an effort to storm the Nevada Air Force facility to search for aliens.
To gain more exposure for their brand, Delgado and Jones connect with makeup artists on Instagram and send them free samples that they can use to create makeup looks based on the accessories. This leads to user-generated content on their Instagram feed, which mainly comprises of pictures sent in by customers and has led to an increased interest in their earrings, they said. 
“That’s mainly where we get our new audiences from,” Jones said. “We branch out because we send stuff to people that have a lot of followers and they post the look that all those people see and then they follow us.”
Alexia Sambrano, a sophomore studying neuroscience and cognitive science, knew Delgado and Jones before they started their business. When she heard they were starting a company, she was supportive about what they were doing. Sambrano also tried their products and said it was the uniqueness of Kikay’s earrings that drew her to the line. 
“I’ve seen other earrings inspired by fruits and space but all of this is handmade, and you can really tell all of the effort they’ve put in each earring pair they’ve made,” Sambrano said. “I wear a lot of metal earrings and they can get really heavy, they can hurt your ears and pinch at them. [Kikay’s] are really lightweight and affordable and comfortable and that’s one of the reasons I decided to make the purchase.”
To balance their work, Delgado manages production and graphics while Jones focuses on web development and marketing, but they discuss all of their decisions together. This year, they’ve converted the garage into a studio, where they make the earrings by hand and get them ready for shipping each morning. 
Delgado and Jones credit their “Disruptive Innovation” class with teaching them to design a brand, create company values and have all of their business decisions reflect those ideals. They believe the class taught them how to go about decision making while staying true to the brand and helped them come up with a core philosophy for Kikay. 
The two young business owners credit IYA for giving them a supportive environment where they can manage their business and still attend class because their classes teach them skills they can use when running their business. A multimedia class they’re taking this semester requires them to create advertising campaigns, which they plan on catering toward their brand.
“One of the big philosophies of the academy is if you have an idea, just do it, like try it as fast as you can and see what will happen,” Jones said. “[Business] grown a hundred times, we’ve just been around for seven weeks. So much has happened, we’ve been moving based on gut decision. It was only like a week from idea to implementation.” 
Delgado and Jones hope to continue to expand Kikay through partnerships with other artists and social media reach. On top of earrings, they also sell scrunchies and hair clips and want to soon include other clothing and accessories like bags, hats and shirts.  
“I think our goal is to expand into a fashion business but more focusing on statement pieces. Instead of just selling a lot of shirts and a lot of pants, more like here’s this one awesome piece that’s low cost and you can wear.”

 When then-sophomore Jonathan Lu looked through the list of consulting services group students could join at USC, he realized that none of them cater to startups, a market that he saw potential to grow. 
He then talked with his roommate Zach Mollo as well as Chloe Hsu and John McCubbin, and the group created RISE Consulting, a student organization that provides free consulting services for startups. Now in its second semester, RISE, or “Rebels, Innovators, Startups and Entrepreneurs,” is recruiting new members and accepting online applications for the first time and hopes to bring about 20 students onto its team. 
Last spring, the organization’s sole client was M. Todd Architect, an architecture firm based in Brooklyn. RISE co-founders Lu, Hsu, McCubbin and Mollo, now juniors at USC, worked with the startup last spring to develop a pricing model and recommend marketing materials and promotional strategies.
“It wasn’t a traditional consulting case, in the sense that it wasn’t like a very specific market entry issue with a startup, for example,” said Mollo, RISE’s vice president of engagement. “It was a lot of general issues for an architecture firm, which we weren’t that experienced in, and starting that first semester was a little difficult to know where we wanted to go.”
The organizations will work with four new start-ups this semester: TruStory, a debate and social network startup; Alpha Aerospace, a drone company run by a USC alum; We Strive, a fitness platform and Robust Choice, a win/loss analysis firm. 
Each project lasts 10 weeks, allowing RISE to help its clients through the course of the semester to optimize business and pricing models and create promotional materials. Lu said RISE plans to check in with former clients after their plans are implemented to evaluate their work and progress.
“Maybe three months later, we’ll check in and ask, ‘What are the results?’” Lu said. “We always want to do that and be able to offer that advice, just so we can have those relationships going.”
Getting RISE off the ground presented a few challenges as the club’s founders had to seek potential clients via LinkedIn and startup websites.
“When we first started the org, it was hard to reach out [to startups],” Mollo said. “Our brand wasn’t really that developed. We didn’t really know a lot about consulting and bringing in different founders and things like that.”
Mollo said over 60 students have applied and the executive board will hold group and individual interviews where applicants will work on a case to decide its new membership.
Hsu, the vice president of administration, said the organization will accept students with any level of consulting experience. The organization will hold workshops to teach new members consulting skills like presenting data, making a pitch deck and researching for their case. 
A lot of the learning process, however, will be taught throughout the semester as the analysts and engagement managers work with each business.
“The actual engagements and projects that students are going to work on is going to give them real hands-on experience in the field of consulting, and not just looking at profit loss statements,” Mollo said.
Within the organization, members are broken up into four- to five-person subgroups called engagement teams, which are headed by a manager and partnered with one of the four start-ups. This semester, the four founding members of RISE are assuming the managerial roles and leading their new members, whom they call “business analysts,” through the workshops at their weekly three-hour meetings.
Along with teaching its members consulting and business skills, Hsu said the co-founders hope to teach new members how to run the organization, so that after she and her fellow co-founders  graduate in 2021, the organization can remain established.
“They’re going to learn not just how to show up and listen to us and take notes, but they’re going to learn how to lead and innovate and implement their ideas,” Hsu said.
Lu said he hopes to eventually double the organization’s size.
“Long-term goal [for the organization], I’m going to guess like 40, 50 people is like a base for how many students we want,” Lu said. “Clients-wise, probably like eight a semester would be really awesome.”
Since RISE doesn’t charge its clients for the services it provides, Lu said the organization has also considered hosting funding initiatives to build a budget and pay for training and development opportunities like guest speakers.
“What’s really great is students get to not only network with these founders, they get to meet a founder of the startup to get them to become inspired,” Mollo said. “They can see what these founders are doing. Just talk with them.”
While RISE has only just started, its founders have big plans to expand and improve, hoping to eventually becoming the premier consulting group on campus.
“Based on the semester, obviously as an up-and-coming organization, there are always problems to tackle,” Mollo said. “But the future of RISE? It’s pretty bright.”
CORRECTIONS: A previous version of this article misspelled TruStory’s name. It has since been updated with the correct spelling. 
The story also incorrectly stated that TruStory is a literary startup. According to Lu, TruStory is a debate and social network startup.
The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

After the hubbub of move-in day and Welcome Week dies down, every new Trojan comes to the realization that they now share a small room with another person. Their roommate may be a best friend from high school, someone they connected with on Facebook or a stranger. Regardless, having a new roommate plays a key role in the freshman year experience and shapes the years to follow. So, USC Housing should assign all freshmen their roommates, without giving the option to request their own.
When half of freshmen rush to social media to judge profiles in search of a roommate they can request, it creates an environment of anxiety before a student even takes his or her first step on campus. The other half of freshmen opt out of requesting their own roommate, some simply because they are overwhelmed with the process of finding their own and fear rejection. 
Currently, incoming freshmen fill out an online application that provides them with matches of potential roommates based on their own answers. Christopher Ponsiglione, director of USC Housing, said that USC tries to “match roommates of similar tastes and preferences when a preferred roommate is not requested.” To make these matches and manage contracting and assignments, USC Housing uses a software suite called StarRez. 
The application asks students questions to rate themselves on things that include cleanliness, sleep-schedule, interest in the Greek system, preferred noise level, comfortability with visitors, interest in religious organizations and smoking preferences. Mr. Ponsiglione said that StarRez then uses an auto-allocate algorithm to match students with similar answers, placing an emphasis on smoking preference, usually a number one priority for students. Finally, the student can request to room with one of the matches provided, someone else not on the generated list or opt for USC Housing to pair them with someone else. 
The process of finding a roommate can be overwhelming, especially for those who immediately go on a frenzied search to request a roommate. After being admitted, a typical freshman who decides to request their own roommate will create a Facebook account and post an advertisement-like introduction in search for a roommate. Then, they scroll through Facebook posts of students who are also looking for a roommate, claiming they “love to go out and have fun but are also down to stay in and watch Netflix” until they hopefully find someone who resonates with them. After what seems like mere minutes, people begin pairing off and securing roommates.
Social media only heightens the problem that, when given the option to pick a roommate, students gravitate toward those who look like them or come from a similar background. College offers a person the unique opportunity to venture out of their comfort zone and be exposed to new ideas and people. If USC used questionnaires to match all freshmen, students would meet a broader range of people. Additionally, the stress of requesting someone would cease and students would likely end up with a better roommate than if they picked one themselves. 
Case in point: Hamilton College in New York does not allow freshmen to choose their own roommates. At first, Rachel Harshaw, a 2017 graduate, said she was very unhappy with this policy. She was initially guarded with her suitemates because she did not expect to get along with them. However, after getting to know them during the year, they became her best friends who she now lives with post-graduation.
As we approach housing reassignments this week, USC Housing should do more to match students as roommates so that reassignments can be avoided at all costs.
In fact, a 2015-2016 school year survey conducted by the research firm SkyFactor on over 20,000 students from 15 distinct universities, with different roommate pairing processes, found that only 10% of students asked for reassignments. The SkyFactor survey illustrates that, if given enough information, schools can make good matches that lead to long-lasting friendships like Harshaw experienced at Hamilton. 
The first step to USC Housing accurately matching roommates is for them to update their application process by gathering more robust information. Although the current questions suffice for basic living preferences, they need to ask deeper questions to match roommates that won’t simply coexist, but will befriend and learn from one another. A personality test, for example, could pair students with complementary personalities and potentially mesh seeming opposites, like introverts with extroverts. 
Once procuring more insightful information, USC Housing should create a job for people to match incoming freshmen, instead of just using an algorithm like StarRez. At Stanford University, for example, paid undergraduate students match all roommates. Real people can account for the intricacies and nuances of human behavior and put more thought into matches, which may lead to more successful pairings.
The first year of college is both an exciting and scary time that should push students out of their comfort zone. Therefore, USC Housing would better fulfill the ultimate goal of college by abandoning its current system. Because, in the end, although classes are extremely important, the biggest impact on students beyond their diploma are the people they met and the relationships they form.
