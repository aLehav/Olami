I really can’t believe what I’m about to do. I am likely about to commit one of the gravest crimes for a Daily Trojan columnist. I’m going to commit a cardinal (and gold) sin: praising a UCLA alumnus.
Yes, I’m speaking of superstar Oklahoma City Thunder guard and — regrettably — UCLA product Russell Westbrook. On Sunday afternoon, Westbrook kept his video-game-esque season going with a heart-stopping performance against the Denver Nuggets on the road. Westbrook dropped 50 points, reeled in 16 rebounds and dished out 10 assists in the Thunder’s victory over the Nuggets.
Westbrook’s 3-point field goal at the final buzzer silenced the Denver crowd and lifted Oklahoma City to a thrilling 106-105 win.
By notching triple-double No. 42 of the season on Sunday, Westbrook was officially crowned the NBA’s triple-double king. Westbrook broke Oscar Robertson’s 55-year record for most triple-doubles in a single season (41) with his effort against the Nuggets. Westbrook also became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double over the course of a campaign since Robertson did so in 1962, averaging 31.9 points, 10.4 assists and 10.7 rebounds per game so far this season.
The six-time All-Star is also currently in line to come away with the NBA’s scoring title. Westbrook has done it all for the Thunder this season, and he has been able to retain a league-best 30.9 player efficiency rating throughout.
Considering the mind-boggling numbers mentioned above, shouldn’t adding an MVP award to Westbrook’s mantle be inevitable? Shouldn’t crushing a 55-year-old record in professional sports be an almost instant clincher of MVP hardware? Robertson’s triple-double record was considered untouchable and unbreakable by many, especially in this era of basketball.
When former baseball slugger Barry Bonds swatted 73 home runs — besting the former record of 70 — in 2001, there was no debate about who would come away with the National League MVP award. When New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady tossed 50 touchdown scores in 2007, an NFL record, he received 49 of 50 possible MVP votes. Even in the basketball arena, when Golden State’s Stephen Curry hit an NBA-record 402 3-point field goals last season — demolishing his own record of 286 — he became the first unanimous MVP in league history.
My point? Crushing a so-called un-crushable record in professional sports is usually followed by an MVP award.
By topping Robertson as the model of triple-double consistency, Westbrook has officially put an end to all MVP-race debate between him and the Houston Rockets’ James Harden. When Westbrook hit that 36-foot game-winning dagger against the Nuggets on Sunday, he clinched his defining moment as the league’s most valuable assassin this season.
For the vast majority of this regular season, it’s been a highly followed race for the MVP trophy between Harden and Westbrook. Harden has no doubt had a standout 2016-2017 season of his own. Averaging 29.3 points, 11.2 assists and 8.1 rebounds per game this season, Harden has been an offensive juggernaut for the Rockets. In fact, Harden leads the NBA with 63 double-doubles recorded this season (Westbrook is second with 62).
I’d go as far as saying that if Harden were having the season he’s currently enjoying during any year other than this one, he’d be considered the runaway candidate for Most Valuable Player.
But it really does blow my mind to see fans and media pundits alike blow off the significance of Westbrook’s historic season. Good grief: I mean, put aside the Robertson comparisons and consider that Michael Jordan — the GOAT — only recorded 28
triple-doubles over the course of his entire 15-year NBA career.
Another historical note: Westbrook’s 50-16-10 effort in Denver on Sunday was his third 50-point triple-double of the season. Westbrook is now the only player in NBA history with three 50-point triple-doubles, and he got them all in a single regular season.
It’s a real shame that many have opted to shame Westbrook, falsely accusing him of stat-padding this season to top Robertson’s record. It’s evident that Westbrook’s valiant efforts have benefited his team. It’s necessary to note that the Thunder are 33-9 this season when Westbrook records a triple-double: They are 13-25 when he does not.
So when Harden comes out like he did on Sunday, saying the MVP Award is predominantly about winning, he really isn’t making a better case for himself. Look, I will fully admit that Harden has been the leading force for a Rockets team that currently finds itself third in a hyper-competitive Western Conference.
But is anyone really going to tell me that Westbrook has not been the most valuable player possible for this Oklahoma City team, which has locked up the sixth seed in the West? Remember, this is in fact the same Thunder franchise that many left for dead back in July when Kevin Durant announced he was taking his talents to Golden State over the offseason.
It would have taken a herculean effort from Westbrook to make the Thunder postseason relevant this year, and he has given them just that and beyond this season.
Following Durant’s departure, everyone projected that Westbrook was primed to go berserk this season statistics-wise. But could anyone have ever predicted this historic of a campaign?
So, what’s next for Westbrook and company? A first-round tango with Harden and the No. 3-seed Rockets begins in Houston this weekend.
My thoughts on this impending Harden-Westbrook duel? Get your popcorn ready, folks.

The No. 1 men’s golf team won the Western Intercollegiate tournament this weekend in Santa Cruz, Calif., closing out the regular season as the top-ranked team in the country. The tournament was a highlight for sophomore Justin Suh, who notched the first win of his collegiate career.
This was the fourth title of the year for the Trojans, who won with a final score of 1,050 (347-348-355). The finish was 18 strokes better than Stanford, which came in second place, and 20 strokes ahead of Oregon in third.
Suh’s victory came with a 5-under 205 finish (68-67-70). It was his third finish in the final top three on the season, ending with five birdies in the final round. Suh won by four strokes, leading the entirety of Sunday’s play.
Meanwhile, junior Sean Crocker took home a tie for second at 1-under 209 (72-70-67) after a clutch 3-under final round. That final round helped Crocker extend his streak of under par tournaments to eight straight. Fellow junior Jonah Texeira tied for eighth, finishing 2-over
(68-73-71). It was the best finish for Texeira since November’s Gifford Collegiate tournament.
Seniors Rico Hoey (72-71-72) and Andrew Levitt (73-67-75) rounded out the group with a tie for 21st, finishing 5-over 215, while freshman Cheng Jin tied for 39th with 9-over 210 (67-77-75).
Now, the Trojans prepare to enter postseason play next week with a trip to the Pac-12 Championships. They finished fifth in the conference last spring during the tournament in Salt Lake City.
After the Pac-12 Championships, the Trojans will look toward the NCAA Championships. The regional tournament will kick off on May 8, but it’s uncertain which location the Trojans will be assigned to for the first round. Six different courses around the country will host NCAA Regionals, and the Trojans could find themselves in nearby Stanford, Calif. or as far away as Austin, Texas or Baton Rouge, La.
USC is looking to make it all the way to the finals in Sugar Grove, Ill. after a disappointing finish to last year’s season. Despite a No. 3 ranking, the Trojans fell to Texas in a 4-1 semifinals upset, prematurely ending an otherwise successful season.
This year, the Trojans come in as the favorite to take the tournament. In the last four months, the Trojans have notched only one finish below second place in a tournament. A particularly strong showing in March and February helped the team leap from No. 6 to No. 1 in the national rankings, coming off the heels of top-two finishes at the Amer Ari Invitational, the Southwestern Invitational, the Southern Highlands Collegiate and The Goodwin.
With three weeks to prepare, the Trojans are locking in as they look to redeem themselves after last year’s fifth-place finish at the Pac-12 Championships. The tournament will tee off on April 28 in Boulder, Colo.

Following the cancellation of Springfest 2017 on April 1, the USC community has grappled with questions around student safety and security on campus.
The concert, which was supposed to feature opening act Migos and headliner Rae Sremmurd, was stopped, and students were asked to evacuate in the middle of Migos’ set. USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning said that least 10,000 people attended the event, and about 30 percent of those were non-USC students. According to the Department of Public Safety, overcrowding — and particularly a large influx of guest attendees — contributed to safety hazards, a problem that USC is working to solve in the future.
DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said the crowd was the largest he had seen in his 10 years at USC.
“The fencing has been adequate in the past, but it didn’t seem to serve its purpose this year considering there was a breach of the perimeter, meaning people were able to get over the fence and into the event,” Carlisle said.
DPS officers, Los Angeles Police Department officers, the Los Angeles Fire Department marshal and other USC security personnel were present at the concert to ensure the safety of attendees. They were tasked with tracking the number of people in the area and monitoring any injuries or potential hazards.
Leading up to Migos’ start time, the quad became more and more packed, with thousands of concertgoers vying for the best view. Soon there were reports of fainting and trampling near the stage as the crowd continued to push relentlessly forward.
Only one transport regarding a minor injury occurred, although there were other injuries reported, according to DPS.
Students agreed that the event was dangerous and should have been shut down, but they also pointed to the shortage of security personnel and the ease with which some were able to gain entry without being accompanied by a student.
“I forgot my student ID, so I was going to have one of my friends guest me in, but my friend walked in and I saw how easy it was for her to get in,” said Kayla Meyerowitz, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering. “So she passed me back her ID, right in front of the security guard’s face, and I used it to get in too.”
Manny Raposo, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said that the security personnel were unable to even manage the lines at the entrance.
“I was in line for maybe half an hour, waiting and waiting, and it was moving a little bit but it was still super long,” Raposo said. “It was sometime after Migos was supposed to start, but at one point the line just kept moving and we all just started running, and before I knew it I was [inside the quad]. I didn’t have to show ID or anything.”
Emma Slagle, an undeclared freshman, said that large pockets of people not associated with the University were scattered throughout the quad.
“My friend Jasper said that someone came up to him and asked, ‘Do you even go to USC?’ He said, ‘Yeah, do you guys not?’ [and they replied] ‘No, none of us do,’” Slagle said, referring to a group of people who were from the nearby area but were unaffiliated with USC.
Bernard Taylor, a sophomore majoring in human biology, said that the USC Concerts Committee should limit these events to USC students only in the future.
“I feel like the concerts should be exclusively for USC students, with no ‘plus ones,’” Taylor said. “The rowdiest people were actually the guests, so I think it should just be [students]. It will still be crazy, but at least you wouldn’t have random people around.”
Taylor also said that the volatility of the crowd made him fear for the safety of his friends.
“During a Migos song … [one of my friends] got pushed to the ground and was almost trampled,” Taylor said. “I put my arms around my friends so they wouldn’t fall and get trampled. I literally wasn’t even listening to Migos because I was so fixated on making sure my friends were alright.”
Taylor argued that responsibility for the event being shut down rests with the Concerts Committee, and that it should have anticipated the larger crowd and had better security at the event.
“You can say the crowd was crazy … but who is supposed to make sure that the crowd doesn’t get too packed?” Taylor said. “If you’re going to bring in Migos and Rae Sremmurd, you should definitely beef up security.”
Concerts Committee did not respond to request for comment.
William Regensburger, the director of USC’s Fire Safety and Emergency Planning department, said safety and security personnel were left with no choice but to cancel the event in the face of an overwhelming crowd.
“The problem was simply that far more people showed up than expected, and many of them jumped the fence and entered the Quad even though it was at capacity,” Regensburger said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “The Los Angeles Fire Department had a staff member there to help ensure the safety of the event, as they always do for large USC events, and he is the one who made the decision to shut the event down due to safety concerns.”
Regensburger added that another reason for the cancellation was the need to tend to those with medical issues.
“The Fire Department officer exhibited great patience in first trying to make announcements to the crowd to observe the safety protocols and not do anything to jeopardize their own or others’ safety,” Regensburger wrote. “However, a number of people then sustained minor injuries or medical problems, so that they had no choice but to stop the event and shut it down. At every USC event, the very first priority is safety, and as we had to start trying to respond to those with medical issues in this thick crowd it was clear there was no choice but to shut down.”
Carlisle said DPS, LAFD and USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning are looking ahead to next year’s Springfest and are brainstorming better safety measures. Concrete decisions regarding next year’s security will be made by senior administrators in the future, Carlisle said.
“There has been discussion of if we have popular music groups that are selected by the students, maybe we would need a larger venue where it would be easier to control the crowd and there would be more space,” Carlisle said.
Regensburger said this year’s shutdown serves as a learning experience to prevent cancellations and safety hazards in the future.
“At this point, we are planning to get together the various departments and groups involved in event planning to debrief and identify any changes we can make for future concerts to help them be successful, but also 100 percent safe,” Regensburger wrote. “We don’t know yet what changes will be needed, but I’m sure we can find ways to mitigate the problems.”
How about moving it to the Coliseum next year.

Building the future · Milton Curry will become the dean of USC’s School of Architecture after serving as a dean at the University of Michigan – Photo from USC News
Milton Curry has been selected as the new dean of the USC School of Architecture, effective July 1, according to USC News.
Curry succeeds Qingyun Ma, who served as dean for ten years.
Curry, who is currently an associate dean for academic affairs and strategic initiatives at the University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, has performed cutting-edge research on the intersection of architecture and race. He will hold the Della and Harry MacDonald Dean’s Chair in Architecture upon arriving at USC.
Curry has founded and co-founded the Critical Productive and Appendx journals, respectively. CriticalProductive explores the connections among race, urbanism, politics and architecture, among other fields, and seeks to spark conversations about architectural theory and its relation to different areas of academia.
“We are honored and excited to welcome Professor Curry to the USC School of Architecture,” said Provost Michael Quick, who made the announcement on Monday on behalf of President C. L. Max Nikias to USC News. “Architecture has a profound impact on our culture. It is a profession and an art, local and global, and extremely creative. We know that Professor Curry will lead our students, faculty, research and practice to new heights.”
Having first taught at Arizona State University from 1992 to 1995, Curry has since held professorships at Cornell University, the University of Michigan and the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.
Curry received his bachelor’s degree in architecture from Cornell and his master’s degree in architecture from Harvard, concentrating in architecture theory.
Curry’s spouse, Reighan Gillam, will also join the USC faculty as a professor of anthropology in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.

Jacqueline Chao | Daily Trojan
A year after One Direction’s announcement of a hiatus in March 2016, fans are clamoring to see how the boys will fare in solo careers. All five ex-members are maturing from teen heartthrobs to distinctive artists, each working to establish their solo careers. Four of the five have released singles, with the exception of Liam Payne, who, after signing a record deal with Capitol Records, will release his single later in 2017. With diverse new sounds from acoustic to electronic, all the boys are poised for thriving independent careers, but true to form, frontman Harry Styles is upstaging his counterparts.
Harry Styles — “Sign of the Times” 
After years of anticipation, Harry Styles released his first official solo track, “Sign of the Times,” on Friday. With a mellifluous piano intro that swells by the first chorus, Styles
delivered a moving and passionate performance that showcases a vocal range he lacked while under the pop brand of One Direction’s music.
While the song is on the lengthier side and the lyrics were slightly repetitive, Styles’ lyrics are imbued with multifaceted meanings that have garnered speculation from critics. The chorus is simultaneously ominous and hopeful, resonating both romantic and sociopolitical implications: “Just stop your crying, it’s a sign of the times / We gotta get away from here / We gotta get away from here / Just stop your crying, it’ll be alright / They told me that the end is near / We gotta get away from here.”
“It’s the song I’m most proud of writing,” Styles told BBC Radio 1 host Nick Grimshaw in an interview.
Drawing success from vocal prowess, expert instrumentals and powerful lyrics, “Sign of the Times” pays homage to the musical age of David Bowie and Freddie Mercury and is set to become an instant classic just days after its release.
Louis Tomlinson — “Just Hold On”
Following the hiatus of One Direction, Louis Tomlinson lay
relatively low through the birth of his son, but came back strong with “Just Hold On,” an uplifting EDM collaboration track with DJ Steve Aoki. Tomlinson deserves praise for diverging most significantly from the genre One Direction followed. Tomlinson’s move to become a solo artist gave his vocals the chance to shine outside the shadow of his former bandmates, even though the electronic beats spun by Aoki put the number in danger of becoming a generic EDM song.
Lyrically, however, Tomlinson’s message is deeply motivational and ultimately conveys a hopeful translation of the grief he felt after losing his mother. “What do you do when a chapter ends? Do you close the book and never read it again? Where do you go when your story’s done?” he asks himself in the verses, ultimately concluding in the chorus that, “The sun goes down and it comes back up / The world, it turns no matter what.”
Given the deep personal lyrics paired with an infectious dance beat, Tomlinson successfully brands himself as a solo force to be reckoned with in this track.
Niall Horan — “This Town”
Blossoming from the formulaic and trite realm of pop music, Niall Horan made his debut as a soulful balladeer with his acoustic single, “This Town,” in 2016. No longer identifying as the cute boy band member, Horan showcases his throaty vocals, and romantic lyrics reveal how much he intends to mature as an artist. In contrast to his fellow ex-bandmates, Horan rejects the modern music world with a simplistic and old-fashioned sound that harkens back to the acoustic era dominated by individual singer-songwriters.
“If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you / Drive highways and byways to be there with you / Over and over the only truth / Everything comes back to you,” Horan sings, retaining his heartthrob image while displaying an edge reminiscent of bands such as Mumford & Sons and Simon & Garfunkel.
Ultimately, “This Town” is a promising start to Horan’s solo career.
Zayn Malik — “Still Got Time”
After being the first member to leave One Direction over a year ago, Zayn Malik adopted the stage name ZAYN as well as a sexier edge. In a definitive step away from his old boy band, ZAYN released Mind of Mine in 2016, an album that features the hit “PILLOWTALK” and is rife with R&B inspiration, serving as a stark contrast from the adolescent exuberance that characterized his previous performances.
Straying even further from
romantic messages espoused by One Direction songs, ZAYN’s latest single “Still Got Time” tells the world that he’s looking to fool around rather than settle down. “Just stop lookin’ for love / Girl, you know you still got time,” ZAYN sings, his voice lightweight and disappointingly failing to showcase his full vocal range.
The song is a collaboration with PARTYNEXTDOOR, whose autotuned lines — “I know you diggin’ my fabric / I’m boyfriend material” — mellow out the song but render it overall cliched and derivative.
Liam Payne — TBD
Following in the footsteps of his ex-bandmates but taking a paternity break, Liam Payne is set to debut his career as a solo artist in May with “Meet Me Half Way.”
While each member has shown promise for a successful solo career, Styles’ single caters most directly to One Direction’s fanbase, and therefore, he is most likely to be the greatest hit among the five. Though Malik may have jumped ship first, as the unofficial frontman for the band, Styles was always groomed to be the solo artist, and his first single shows that he is now ready to step into this role. While the others may continue to release music and find their niche in the industry, don’t be surprised if Harry Styles is the name you hear for years to come.

The end of the semester is near, and summer is just around the corner. Yet for film lovers, this season is a time to sit in a cold, dark room for a couple of hours, shoving popcorn into their faces and devouring some big-budget movies.
The Fate of the Furious 
This is the eighth (yes, eighth) installment in the Fast and Furious franchise, which is not hitting the brakes in any way. Following Paul Walker’s passing, the film will be without Walker but will still include fan favorites Dwayne Johnson, Vin Diesel and Jason Statham, along with series newcomers Charlize Theron and Helen Mirren.
The storyline of this film is unimportant but revolves around Dom (Diesel) leaving the fast family for Theron. What really matters is the big car action sequences, which will not hold back based on the trailer. Most likely, The Fate of the Furious will be another fun, yet hollow action film that becomes an international box office hit.
Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 
The first Guardians of the Galaxy film shocked movie audiences when director James Gunn took some of the most obscure comic book characters and made a phenomenal hit based on them. So, as is common practice in Hollywood, Guardians of the Galaxy needed to have a sequel. With Gunn back behind the camera, it appears that Volume 2 will not disappoint.
The trailers have done a good job of not giving away any major plot points but still showcasing the guardians back in action (now with baby Groot) while introducing the characters of Yondu and Nebula from the first film into the squad. Rounding out the cast is Kurt Russell as Ego the Living Planet (yes, a planet) and Sylvester Stallone in a yet-to-be announced role. If the film is as colorful and crazy as the trailers and casting choices — and with another hit soundtrack — Volume 2 should be a fitting follow-up.
Wonder Woman
The DC Extended Universe has been struggling with mediocre and critically panned films such as Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad. Though Justice League will arrive in theaters in November, many disappointed fans say that Wonder Woman will be the DC Extended Universe’s final test.
Seventy years after the comic’s creation in 1941, Wonder Woman will finally have her own live-action feature film with Gal Gadot in the titular role. The film will take place in World War I, similar to the first Captain America move which took place during World War II, and will tell the story of Diana Prince leaving her all-women home of Themyscira to go fight with Steve Trevor in the war, possibly with more mystical threats.
The trailers for the film have been visually stunning, but the story appears a bit muted. Thus the fear of another lousy superhero film remains, especially because other DC movies have also had excellent trailers.
Spiderman: Homecoming 
This will be Spiderman’s sixth feature film, but this time Marvel Studios will collaborate with Sony Pictures. It will star Captain America: Civil War breakout Tom Holland in the role of Peter Parker. In this installment, Spiderman will battle against the Vulture, played by the fittingly creepy Michael Keaton. Also featured in the film will be Robert Downey Jr. reprising his iconic role as Tony Stark, who will serve as a mentor figure to Peter.
A significant difference in this film compared to past installments is that Peter Parker will be played by 19-year-old actor Tom Holland, as opposed to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, who were older when they played the same character. The film will also focus more on Peter Parker’s narrative as someone trying to prove his credibility as a superhero. The film’s potential success can be attributed to Marvel’s creativity and Sony’s big budget.

This was the first time that my pre-race ritual included Nyquil. I had never been so scared for a race in my life.
The day before the half-marathon, I had a runny nose in the morning that slowly escalated into an hour-long sneezing fit, watery eyes and a foggy head. I went out for a pasta dinner with my race buddies, but honestly, I couldn’t even taste the food.
The thought of running in this condition made my stomach churn — as if I needed another symptom to add to the list of miseries. Not to mention, I had to be up around 4:30 a.m. to Uber to the race. I laid out my running clothes and headphones that evening and fell asleep at 9:15 p.m., hoping that the water I had chugged and the medicine I had taken and the sleep I was getting would cure me by morning.
When I woke up the next morning, my throat was still a little sore, but my nose wasn’t congested or runny and I wasn’t drowsy from the Nyquil. I hurried out the door to meet my friends Jenny and Edwin for our race.
Hollywood Boulevard looked nothing like the rest of sleepy Los Angeles at 5 a.m. on a Saturday. There were thousands of people warming up, waiting in line for the bathroom or corralling  into groups based on their estimated finishing times.
The lights from the famous El Capitan Theatre lit up the street while pop music blasted from speakers. A big inflatable arch with the Hollywood letters marked the starting line. Jenny was on the lookout for Kiefer Sutherland, the star of the TV show 24. Our Uber driver had told us he was running the half-marathon too. It was funny to think celebrities would be sweating and struggling alongside us through the upcoming 13.1 miles.
Struggling is the key word. Even though I felt okay at the starting line, I knew that could change in the first few minutes of turning a walk into a run. I recalled traumatic memories from that one day of P.E. when my third-grade class had doughnuts right before running the mile. Then, the buzzer went off and I was back on Hollywood Boulevard, breaking into a run to start the half-marathon.
I spent the first mile or two weaving through the crowd, trying to find a crew that was running my pace. At first, I tried to keep up with a woman wearing a tutu and speakers. When she ran the slight downhill, she’d let her arms flail out in front of her to the beat of the music. It was entertaining, but I lost her at a water stop. During half-marathons, there’s a water stop every few miles, and I needed to stop at every one to drink a few sips and keep the sickness at bay.
The miles passed, and the illness never made an appearance at the race. I felt good. The course was mostly flat, and I used that as motivation to lengthen my stride and pick up the pace. I never did find a steady crew, but that’s because I was having too much fun picking off people. I gave my targets nicknames like “Cheeks” (because a certain body part was sticking out of her shorts), and then I’d catch up, I’d pass them and choose a new target.
That worked well until the last mile. I knew we didn’t have much time left, but I couldn’t see the finish line. Then I saw Jenny running on the other side of the cones lining the middle of the street.
It meant there was a turnaround. We shouted some words of encouragement at each other, but I was already dreading whatever else was left because I knew there was way more of it. Where I was sure the finish line should have been, I saw a barrier of cones signaling the turnaround. By then, I had lost all sense of distance and I had no idea when to start sprinting to the end. Finally, I turned a corner and the finish line was just 100 meters away. I blasted past the clock and the fake Oscar statues and my friends who had come to cheer us on. Jenny wrapped me up in a big hug at the finish line, and the runner’s high kicked in.
I was so happy with finishing, with finding the strength in sickness, with embarking on this crazy endeavor with my friends. It turned out I ran a 1:56 half-marathon, beating my previous time by almost six minutes. I may not have won my age group, but I still felt like a champion. After all, that is the reason I run.

Along with the Common Application, essay supplements and resumes, high school seniors applying to college must also complete financial aid applications that make higher education possible for many low-income students. Questions regarding family taxes can be confusing for every high school student, but undocumented students face the additional challenge of overcoming fear of exposure and deportation for their families. According to data published by the California Community College System, California Dream Act financial aid applications have decreased by 40 percent since last year, likely as a result of increased paranoia among undocumented students under the Trump administration’s vehemently anti-immigration rhetoric and policy ideas.
The California Dream Act, which allows undocumented students to pursue education, keeps information provided by applicants private within the state government and does not share information about student citizenship status with the federal government.
This report is indicative of new, major barriers to undocumented students’ access to higher education. These barriers include hostility from the federal government that could result in policies that roll back their rights and protections or amount to rhetoric that prevents  undocumented students from wanting to participate in normal school activities. As the data by the California Community College System reveals, this fear has resulted in a sharp decline in undocumented students applying for financial aid, which, for many, is tantamount to not applying for college at all, as financial aid is the only way higher education could be possible. This suggests another barrier to higher education for undocumented students: a lack of education regarding their rights and legal protections. It is understandable that they live in fear under a president who made deportation and demonizing immigrants the backbone of his presidential campaign, but it is also unacceptable that so many undocumented families have not been adequately informed about their rights.
This data is particularly alarming coming from the California Community College System, since California hosts roughly 23 percent of all undocumented people in the nation. Many undocumented students grew up receiving an American education and expect to stay in the United States to seek employment, which will be exponentially more difficult for them without access to higher education. Thus, barriers to undocumented students’ access to higher education could have the long-term consequence of promoting cycles of intergenerational poverty among undocumented communities.
Not only is it unfair to shun undocumented students from crucial societal spheres such as academia, but it is also dangerous and inequitable to deny students who have worked as hard as their peers access to education due to their nationality or citizenship status. Diverse backgrounds and experiences are what make higher education and academia in America strong and unique and for generations have yielded innovation and research that would have otherwise been impossible. All students, college faculty and frankly all Americans would suffer by limiting who is able to attend college in America — by forcing young undocumented students to live in fear and failing to inform them about their legal rights. To fail to inform them of their rights is tantamount to denying them their rights and contributes to dangerously homogenous colleges and, as previously noted, intergenerational poverty and economic marginalization for undocumented students.
America is strong because of the diverse identity, culture, backgrounds and ideas that it embodies. Undocumented students have the capacity to improve and better our society as much as their peers with citizenship. Denying them the opportunity to receive  a higher education and a career in the United States — their home — will have long-term consequences that will affect society at large.
Many colleges and universities declared themselves sanctuary campuses following the election of President Donald Trump. This declaration carries the promise that the University will not hand over information about undocumented students to the federal government unless ordered to do so by a court of law. The school will also protect undocumented students against intimidation and harassment by law enforcement officials. Although there are legal limitations on a school’s ability to protect undocumented students, additional resources such as counseling and legal advisement must be offered to undocumented students so that they are able to pursue an education equal to their documented peers and are informed of their rights. The latest data by the California Community College System reveals the dangers of students not knowing their legal rights, such as the Dream Act’s promise to protect undocumented students’ information from the federal government.
Undocumented students are our friends, classmates and neighbors. Although the recent political atmosphere has placed them under intense scrutiny, we cannot allow their rights to be sidelined and done away with through fear and misinformation. USC has an obligation to protect its community of immigrant students and the diversity and equity that it claims to value. This means USC should not only make resources to protect undocumented students more accessible but also reach out to surrounding communities and prospective  students to ensure that they know their rights.
Financial aid ultimately makes higher education possible for many students, and higher education is what makes economic enfranchisement and ending intergenerational poverty cycles possible as well. The benefits to equal access to higher education can be felt on every level. Higher education is a right for everyone — including undocumented students.
Higher education is not a right for everyone.  ACCESS to higher education is, and everybody has access.  For some, the journey will be more difficult whether it be financially, or academically.  There are many factors that determine the type, scope or prestige of higher education that will be attainable for those who seek it.  I think it’s remarkable, if not disgusting, how many people in this country illegally feel there should be no repercussion, consequence or limitation to their pursuit of higher education… while at the same time, students from Germany, the UK, China, Japan, Canada, Israel, Iran (you name it) must obtain visas in order to study at USC or any American university.  This is a blatant double-standard that is apparently not only supported, but encouraged, by Democrats and other liberals.  It’s even more alarming when you consider how this double-standard disproportionately favours Latinos and Hispanics.  USC administration itself has taken the dangerous position of formal support for this double-standard, in willful disregard for the law and those who comply with the law.  It’s time for TRUE equality under the law.
Change the first word in the headline of this story from ” Fear ” to ” The Law ” and you got yourself a story.
Your last paragraph is pef3ct, howver, it does not apply to illegals aliens.  They are not citizens of the US, and therefore, do not have the same rights and benefits as citizens.  That’s why they are called illegals. You can call them u documented, but those two words mean exactly the same thing.  If you want to give an illegal tuition support, then how ab I UT giving up your financial aid package and designate an illegal to be the recipient.  While you’re at it, perhaps you should assign one or two mm of you better grades to an u Der performing student and take a C or D in those classes, if you’re so inclined to spread the wealth.
