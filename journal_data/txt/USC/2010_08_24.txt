In 2006, USC Professor of theatre practice Brent Blair got a gig putting on a theater workshop  for Downtown Los Angeles’ oppressed garment workers. But this was not a morale-boosting production of Midsummer Nights Dream. In fact, Blair didn’t even bring a script.
Instead, employees who worked within the largest concentration of garment industry sweatshops in the United States participated in a series of workshops engaged in dialogue about the problems affecting their lives and created their own scenes based on personal stories of injustice — with themselves in starring roles.
“If people engage in a process of writing a play,” Blair said of his methods during a recent panel discussion on theater activism, “everybody moves from passive objects to active subjects.”
But in this line of work, the passive-to-active trajectory doesn’t stop with first-time performers.
During the presentation of the community-centric play, the actors on stage stop the scene — at the climax of an employee-manager dispute, for example — and ask the audience for solutions to the situation. Audience members, once mere observers of the play, get up and direct their suggestions for how the scene should end, which are then improvised by those on stage.
Such is customary in the Theatre of the Oppressed, a title for a range of theatrical forms — such as “forum theatre,” described above — developed by the late Brazilian activist Augusto Boal.
By moving members of oppressed communities from their roles as powerless observers to dominant subjects, Blair — who recently founded USC School of Theatre’s new master’s program in applied theatre arts based around Boal’s teachings — empowers people to do the same in their own lives.
The school’s master’s program, which welcomes its first seven students this fall, is only the second of its kind in the country, yet its creation in a city as diverse as Los Angeles comes as both a positive distinction and a wake-up call.
Though it is only the latest on USC’s growing list of culturally progressive interdisciplinary options, the applied theatre arts program — so called because of its application of theater in non-traditional settings — is also a reminder of the city’s numerous social issues. As a forum for communities to express their problems and collaborate on solutions, Theatre of the Oppressed (also known as T.O.) provides a process much needed in Los Angeles, a city known as much for its Hollywood glamour as for its bursts of civil unrest.
In New York City, where the country’s first Applied Theatre Arts master’s program sprung up, Theatre of the Oppressed could be seen as localizing the Vaudeville stage, a once-dominant entertainment form that became a mixing board for early 20th century identities, ethnicities and sexualities. But in Los Angeles, T.O. techniques are rooted in a different history of activist cultural performance, one that stretches from the pachuco’s zoot suits to N.W.A.’s hard core rhymes.
Instead of perpetuating elitism by providing underserved communities with performances of works that uphold the traditional artist-audience dichotomy, Blair and his contemporaries embrace these histories of rebellion by serving as cultural interrupters, relinquishing theatrical control to a public that didn’t know they could have it. The results encourage people to think about their problems and — hopefully — stimulate solidarity.
As Boal wrote in his eponymous book, Theatre of the Oppressed: “The theatre is a weapon and the people should wield it.”
Local theatre companies, such as Downtown-based Cornerstone for example, have been living by this thought since the early 90s, encouraging Los Angeles’ socially and racially diverse communities to take an active role in creating their own futures. By targeting specific communities — even some that might not traditionally be thought of as oppressed — the internationally-renown group has helped everyone from imprisoned youth to bullied elementary school kids reassess their place in society.
When Blair started teaching at USC in 1994, there was no name for this area of study. Though it takes influence from street theatre, witness theater, agit-prop and performance activism, he saw his students as more cultural field workers than straight actors. It’s true, T.O. practitioners are more often called “jokers” than their true role as facilitators (though Blair insisted he doesn’t facilitate, he “difficultates.”)
It wasn’t until 2003 that the classes Blair started at USC (including “Theatre in the Community,” “Theatre and Therapy” and “Theatre in Education”) were incorporated into the umbrella-titled Applied Theatre Arts minor. And after being inspired by School of Social Work’s Dean Marilyn Flynn to consider someday teaming up with her school, Blair — with encouragement from School of Theatre Dean Madeline Puzo — worked to expand his program again, this time with a separate three-semester masters program that finally opens up the School of Theatre to not just artists, but also educators, therapists, social workers and political activists.
This growth has not come without criticism, however. Blair received a lengthy letter from an angry potential student who could not understand how a highbrow institution such as USC could possibly play host to such a grassroots subject matter.
The answer is simple — it is exactly our reputation as a highbrow institution that allows us to explore these new academic frontiers.
Just as USC became the first university to implement a popular music performance major in the fall of last year, USC is the ideal training ground for the next generation of T.O. jokers. Our adoption of more contemporary practices — despite our art schools’ classical traditions — not only draws local attention to these methodologies, but also legitimizes them for the greater academic community.
Our location in the heart of Los Angeles only adds to the appeal of a program at USC, as it opens up access to an abundance of diverse neighborhoods — some of which Blair’s classes have already assisted.
The one thing to remember with T.O., however, is that despite the multitude of suggestions that are given throughout the process, there are no answers. Employing this use of art in a community-activism setting can spark productive discussions within oppressed communities regarding issues of injustice, but there are not always clear-cut solutions. Concrete actions do follow T.O. events, though. And in a process known as conscientization, evaluations of those actions are followed by subsequent T.O. events, helping the communities put their critical consciousness into action.
These adaptive techniques — developed by Boal and being carried into a new era of pedagogy by Blair — create collaborative environments that lie at the intersection of theater and cultural fieldwork, providing an experience that is both educational and therapeutic without ever being absolute.
Communities are always evolving, with their needs and problems constantly changing. But for every oppressed Angeleno, there will now be a joker-in-training, making hope possible just a university away.
As Boal liked to say at the beginning of his T.O. sessions — “Come Closer.”

School begins in a flurry of bookstore receipts, new syllabi and of course, assigned reading. For those not ready to let go of their fiction fix and for readers searching for a new book to offer them a break from the gray world of textbook language and note-taking, there comes an entourage of writers presenting new works.
Next time your roommate jokes that your concentration is making the room smelled like burnt hair, or you find yourself yearning for some relaxing time before digging into the writing of numerous papers, assign yourself some break time and pick up your favorite paperback or hardcover.
The below titles, whether or not hyped up, surely can grant you the few minutes you need to maintain your sanity. Dip into the beauty of the written word and see where it may take you.
From romance to crime, the next few weeks promise novel works (pun intended) that keep readers entertained and transport them from the world of classes to for 200 pages or more.
Wicked Appetite
By Janet Evanovich
Release date: Sept. 14
Paperback, 320 pages
After writing an impressive amount of romance novels, Evanovich has moved on to mystery novels.
For her newest effort, Evanovich will use the character Diesel from her Stephanie Plum series and create a spin-off series. Wicked Appetite will introduce a new character who will also act as narrator.
Diesel, who first appeared in Vision of Sugar Plums, will continue to battle against the Plum series’ villain Gerewulf Grimorie while also attempting to find relics associated with the seven deadly sins. The novel suggests a mix of romance with a side of crime-fighting and mystery-solving.
Fallout
By Ellen Hopkins
Release date: Sept. 14
Hardcover, 672 pages
As the dizzyingly popular Harry Potter series shows there is no taboo for reading young adult fiction. Hopkins takes you on a 600-page trip not to a fictional land where you can fly on a broom and hide under your invisible cloak, but to the contemporary world marked by challenges and obstacles.
October 2004 marked the release of Hopkin’s debut novel Crank. Though a young adult novel, the story touched on the sensitive topic of drug abuse.
In fact, Hopkins’ often novels seem to touch on delicate subjects, but with a great amount of poignancy and freedom. She continues to write, releasing similar one-word title novels, breaking  the boundaries of genre and written entirely in short poems.
Her upcoming release will once again deal with Kristina and her plight. The novel is the third in what unintentionally became a full-fledged series. The sequel comes with a twist — the narration will be supplied by Kristina’s three oldest children.
Mockingjay
By Suzanne Collins
Release date: Aug. 24
Hardcover, 400 pages
If Hopkins’ young adult tale does not satisfy your craving for another epic series, then nothing will. To start off, she got a nod from vampire-creating Stephenie Meyer with the release of the first installation of her series, The Hunger Games.
The first novel starts us off with the character and her life in a dystopic society which, as any good suffocating and disturbing fictitious society does, creates something to prove its insanity.
This time the twisted community creates the “hunger games” and thrusts some of its young citizens into a vicious struggle to get out of a maze alive. The novel seems to take on the Harry Potter idea of the Tri-Wizard Tournament and expand it into a full-fledged series with gruesome events and cliffhanger endings. Fans will wait no longer for the fate of the characters, as Mockingjay brings the series to an end.
Safe Haven
By Nicholas Sparks
Release date: Sept. 14
Hardcover, 352 pages
If you’ve ever tried your hardest not to cry while watching A Walk to Remember or The Notebook, meet the creator of those heart-wrenching romantic stories, Nicholas Sparks, who is the flame behind those arduous romance films.
As a prolific writer of romance novels, and currently one of the most well-paid authors, Sparks has offered some inspiration for numerous touching, chick-flick films.
Sparks created tear-jerkers with characters balancing a variety of issues, including class differences and mental illness, with a seemingly indestructible bound to another human being.
His latest upcoming novel promises readers another romantic adventure, this time involving a college student. Safe Haven hits bookstores next month and will surely continue to keep Spark’s name on the best-seller list.

Let’s be honest; there hasn’t been a busier man in Southern California over the past month than new Athletic Director Pat Haden.
For a man thrust into the responsibility of reinvigorating a program that has lost some of its prestige and luster the past year, the former Rhodes Scholar has taken the bull by the horns — so much so that Google News can’t even keep track of all his recent exploits.
There was the emptying of a certain trophy case in Heritage Hall, the overdue pink slip sent to Deudeaux Field — even the appearances he made at the football team’s first fall practices should be applauded. Because, unlike his predecessor, what drives this man to show up isn’t the obligation of the job or a chance for a candid photo-op, but rather his passion for the university, which runs much deeper than simply pride in the athletic program.
But for a man who has put the word loyal back in loyalty, I have one final request for the student body.
August around these parts doesn’t exude strong sentiments for college basketball, and that’s understandable. But although Haden has excelled in his first 30 days on the job, my offer for the former USC quarterback couldn’t come a second too soon.
I’ve heard that students here get a bad rap for being self-absorbed and even greedy at times, but if ever a university needed a campaign for that M.O., I don’t mind being the poster child right now.
When you think of the most dominant men’s basketball programs across the country, names like Duke, Kansas, UNC and Michigan State are likely the first to pop up.
What do they all have in common?
Aside from the plethora of national championships, Hall of Fame-bound coaches and a community that embraces them through thick and thin, the answer is: a vibrant student section.
There is no better recipe on a Saturday night to drive college populaces from the fraternity kegs towards the arena turnstiles than a culture built on banner raisings and monumental moments in March.
However, one glance at USC’s basketball history and selling USC fans on the Galen Center isn’t that simple.
Though I can’t complain that the university has put its first foot forward in recent years — allowing students to enter the Galen Center with just a simple flick of their I.D. cards — it’s time for an upgrade for loyalty.
Although last year’s season was marred by the actions and inactions of men who no longer are associated with USC, hidden beneath the ugliness of scandal was the beauty of unity and school pride.
Despite resting in the wake of Mike Garrett’s self-imposed one-year postseason ban, never was home court advantage so evident on this campus as it was inside the Galen Center last February during home games against Cal and UCLA.
Say what you will about the noise inside the Coliseum during marquee games or the rabid fans that took to the stands of the McDonalds Swim Stadium last fall to cheer on the back-to-back NCAA champion men’s water polo team; what took place last year in the Trojan Fever section was astonishing, uncommon and, best of all, reward-worthy.
I grasp the concept “You get what you pay for.” But given the enthusiasm shown last year, the seats given to USC students during the basketball season is a subtle slap in the face.
The Galen Center is a palace of a sports arena, with great P.A. sound, H.D. scoreboards and comfort most sports fans would revel in. And yet the entire student body is relegated to watching the game going north to south, through the backside of a glass backboard.
Traditionally at most universities, the area behind and around the basket is reserved for the band, cheerleaders and members of the community. But at USC, this domain of about 1,200 seats belongs to the students.
There’s no point crying over spilled milk, but my advice for Haden and recently appointed Associate Athletic Director J.K. McKay is that if you don’t want that milk to go sour anytime soon, let the Trojan Fever spread to the sidelines.
Angelenos might squirm at the idea of sharing elbow space with snot-nosed 20-somethings, but it’s time to go back to rule No. 1 of business ethics: Cater to the needs of the paying customer.
And despite the deep pockets of some of the Trojan followers that reside in Los Angeles, the paying customer I am speaking of are the thousands of students that pour tuition money into this university each semester. You know, the people these games are played for in the first place.
In Durham, N.C., you can smell the sweat of Kyle Singler. In Chapel Hill, N.C., students can hear the verbal diarrhea spewing from Roy Williams as he chastises an official over a blown call. In East Lansing, Mich., Michigan State’s students don’t have an entire section, they lay claim to most of the entire lower bowl.
Even across the way in Westwood, where they play second fiddle to USC in academic rankings and Gauntlet showdown victories, UCLA students hold one distinct advantage when it comes to the hardwood: a much better viewing experience.
This plea for an upgrade might easily fall on deaf ears, especially since Haden has more on his proverbial plate than hot dog eating world champion Joey Chestnut.
But if ever there were a man that could sympathize with this 1,200-word loyalty-themed violin solo, it’s our athletic director. Look no further than his 34-year marriage to his wife, or his undying love for this school at a time when it hasn’t been easy to exhibit that type of affection.
So Mr. Haden, if your tenure of restoration is to continue down your current path of excellence, remember the process of maintaining a relationship with the student body — one which is based on trust and loyalty.
Who knows, a small act of good faith could go a long way.
The ball is in your court.

Sorry Dave, but as a season ticket holder for men’s and women’s basketball for 30 yrs, I have got to say that you have it backwards.  Students want the best seats and then they will come and support…I say come and show you support now and let there be no doubt that you deserve better seats later.  What I witness, however, is the students showing up at some men’s games, but with one or two exceptions never filling the place.  For women’s basketball games, it is totally embarassing as you could many times count the students in attendance on two hands.  There is really no excuse for that.  There are student giveaways and contests in addition to the free tix and you get to support a team of your fellow students.  When the women’s team really got support it was because of the kids for A Day at Troy and the team felt really appreciative of the support there for them, but not from their fellow students.  Put up or shut up.

A few weeks after losing top recruit Seantrel Henderson to Miami, the USC football team gained one of the Hurricane’s biggest playmaking threats.
Amid a number of players leaving the program, junior Thearon Collier decided to join the sanctioned Trojans. The wide receiver and punt returner will have to sit out this season because of NCAA transfer rules but looks to make signficant contributions next season.
Collier provides USC with explosive talent both on offense and special teams. The 5-foot-9, 192-pound junior caught 44 passes for 574 yards and three touchdowns during his two seasons at Miami and also returned two punts for touchdowns last season, causing some people to compare him to another Hurricane returner, Devin Hester.
But while his decision to join a program handcuffed by the NCAA is intriguing, the real story lies in Collier’s past — one that includes losing a father and a son, and an adolescence bolstered by football.
Collier, 20, is older than his father ever was. In a tragic series of events, his father was murdered when he was 18 in a case of mistaken identity, according to the homicide detectives. Collier had yet to be born.
As a result, Collier grew up in a single-mom household and took on a very reserved personality. He recounted an encounter with Miami coach Randy Shannon to The Miami Herald.
“Every time I’d see Coach Shannon in the hallway I’d drop my head down,’’ Collier said. “He would say, ‘Put your head up.’ I came into his office a couple times but I was scared because I’m not used to opening up.”
Collier said he’s since become more comfortable opening himself up to others, but his life hasn’t gotten any easier.
Collier comes to the Trojans after being dismissed from the Miami team for unspecified reasons.
Several publications in the area speculate that absences  stemming from off-the-field incidents played a role in the decision. One of those incidences involved the death of his child at birth, which occurred earlier this spring.
Despite the recent issues with Collier, USC coach Lane Kiffin is excited to welcome Collier to the team and provide him with a fresh start across the country.
“After talking to him, talking to people at the University of Miami, we feel very confident he’ll come here, fit in, work extremely hard to go through this season,” Kiffin said to The Orange County Register. “He’s been through a lot. He’s had a very tough life so far. I’m glad we could give him an opportunity. Talking to a number of people, I think it’s very clear that this is something that’s very good for him, to get away from home, and start fresh. I know he’s excited to be here as well.”
Why was he dismissed from Miami?  Is it important to know if he was dismissed for violent behavior, cheating, assault or any serious infraction of the law?  Or doesn’t SC care as long as he is a big time player?
GOING TO BURNING MAN!
agreed – still the best place to launch to the NFL
We still are the cream of the crop when it comes to sending players to the NFL, so despite losing the scholarships, we will still attract the top talent around.

Starting this semester, the Lyon Center has extended its hours until midnight and plans to do major renovations to its facilities in the coming months.
Students have been asking for longer hours, said Jennifer Siu, associate director of recreational sports. Although some wanted the center to remain open until 2 a.m., or even for 24 hours, visitors can now exercise until midnight every day of the week. It used to close at 11 p.m. on most days.
“Hours have changed hopefully to meet the needs of the students,” Siu said.
The Lyon Center also wants to change hours on days with USC football games to accommodate all students — especially those who are not attending games — by not closing the center three hours before the game begins, as the center has typically done.
But aside from the hours, there are several other changes at the Lyon Center.
To keep students informed with recreational news, students can now sign up for a weekly recreational newsletter that includes changes to facilities, upcoming registration deadlines and workout schedules. Several new flatscreen televisions can also be found throughout the center in areas such as the lobby and first floor hallways in order to increase entertainment value and communication, Siu said.
The new televisions provide places for displaying recreational news, workout schedules and Lyon Center announcements, in addition to flatscreens for live television channels.
“We can’t make the building bigger, but we can try to make it nicer,” Siu said.
The center plans — though with no specific timeline — to replace carpets, redesign locker rooms and generally update the building.
Since the university built the Lyon Center in 1989, the center now serves about three times the amount of visitors, said Nehi Ogbevoen, vice president of the Undergraduate Student Government. As a result, student leaders are exploring ways to improve the facility.
“We’re trying to get an idea of exactly what USC is lacking,” Ogbevoen said. “There are talks about adding some rec center space.”
Ogbevoen and USG President Chris Cheng have been meeting with the office of Student Affairs to identify what changes are needed in the Lyon Center. This summer, Ogbevoen and Cheng visited CSU Fullerton to get ideas about exercise spaces at other universities.
“There was just more space [than in the Lyon Center.] You can tell that they designed the building for the students,” Ogbevoen said.
However, the main challenge for recreational sports is funding. The Lyon Center can only make changes within its own building, because another facility is not available as of now, unless a large donation is made specifically to its department, Siu said.
“We serve more of the students, but athletics brings in more of the money,” Siu said.
The athletic department plans to build a new athletic facility for varsity athletes on the current intramural field, located behind Heritage Hall. This new building would leave some intramural sports, such as ultimate frisbee and soccer, without a practice field.
One idea to accommodate intramural and club teams is to allow sports teams to practice in the Galen Center. However, Siu said the move will only work if the Galen Center provides teams with good practice times, storage space and access for both students and staff.
“Intramurals and clubs get at the bottom,” Siu said. “Everything changes based on the space that we’re given.”
Umm… the lyon center normally closes at midnight during the academic years prior.

“For the first time since Margaret Thatcher handbagged the world in 1979, Britain looks like the West’s test-tube,” theorizes The Economist in its recent cover article, titled “Radical Britain.”
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
The publication is right — the United Kingdom is currently the best example of what the United States, and California in particular, can do to overcome its most pressing economic problems. It is important for Californians to pay attention to the experiments underway across the pond, note the results and then consider adding governmental reform to tea, the steam engine, English and the rest of the laundry list of notable things we have copied from the British.
A few months ago, the United Kingdom’s elections resulted in a coalition government composed of the Conservative Tories and center-left Liberal Democrats. Led by the young Conservative David Cameron, this choice in government represented a shift in British politics tantamount to the one marked by President Barack Obama’s election in the United States.
Some key background informations: For 13 years, the left-wing Labour Party led the United Kingdom. Tony Blair was elected prime minister in 1997 as the head of “New Labour,” which sought to govern from the center in order to appeal to the largely moderate British electorate. Blair was a hugely successful politician and became Labour’s longest-serving prime minister.
As with all ruling parties, however, Labour’s popularity eventually faded. Blair resigned as prime minister in 2007 to be replaced by his less telegenic chancellor, Gordon Brown. An expenses scandal in Parliament last year, in which several military personnel were discovered to have charged extravagances like vacation homes to the state, further deteriorated the public’s perception of Brown’s leadership abilities. Finally, Labour’s inability to address the United Kingdom’s multiple problems, especially government debt, led to its downfall in the 2010 elections.
Since then, the “Con-Lib” coalition has brought new energy to British government, transforming the country from a laggard to a leader in addressing the dilemmas faced by most Western democracies.
Thirteen years of Labour, combined with the recent financial crisis, have put the United Kingdom in a fiscal squeeze. Public spending made up a sky-high 51 percent of gross domestic product in 2009, while government revenues amounted to only 40 percent.  This year, the deficit is forecast to be the highest among G-20 economies. However, to rectify this situation by enacting either dramatic spending cuts or tax raises would mean risking the United Kingdom’s recovery from its worst recession in decades.
Further the British are generally dissatisfied with the results of government spending. Education, police, welfare and the health service are all causes of discontent in the electorate, as too much bureaucracy has compromised the delivery of these essential public services.
Notably, one could write almost the exact same two paragraphs about California.
However, Cameron’s government has done more to tackle these problems in its first 100 days than the governator has in his whole term (though Cameron has yet to cameo in a blockbuster movie while in office, so at least we have that).
In June, the chancellor of the exchequer revealed a budget that shrinks most government departments by one quarter. Some taxes were also raised, but it is mostly spending cuts that now have the United Kingdom on track to be running a current budget surplus by 2014-2015.
In the meantime, Cameron is radically overhauling the British state through a policy of decentralization. Like the United States, the United Kingdom is a highly centralized country, with central government spending making up more than half of total public expenses. Cameron’s government is giving power away in an attempt to change this and improve services like education. In particular, it plans to rely on public participation to replace government supervision, such as allowing  “free schools” overseen by nonprofits or parents, giving each district the power to elect its own police commissioner and giving private doctors the power to oversee the public health system.
Effective as it may be, this dual revolution — fiscal tightening combined with decentralizing government — runs two major risks. First, it risks jeopardizing the United Kingdom’s economic recovery. Second, it risks even further deterioration of public services if public participation flops and budgets have been slashed too low. However, it also represents an attempt at problem solving that is bold enough to actually work.
California has yet to take such steps. But we now have the luxury of being able to observe a live “test trial” in a place of similar size and with similar problems to our state.
Soon there will be a new governor; whomever it is should keep an eye on what happens in the next few months in the United Kingdom. If Cameron’s gambles start paying off, the next governor should swallow his or her pride and engage in the sincerest form of flattery: imitation.

A heat wave is sweeping across Southern California this week, making it nearly impossible to get to work or class without flushed cheeks, short breath or a glistening face. The National Weather Service issued an excessive heat warning Tuesday morning, which will last through Wednesday night.
“Everybody’s going to be climbing within three degrees of the records or breaking them,” Stuart Seto, a weather specialist with the National Weather Service, told the Los Angeles Times. “With the humidity added to the heat, it will feel even hotter.”
Highs are set for triple digits in the valley, and only simmer down a bit inland — Downtown Los Angeles is expected to hit a high of 99 degrees Tuesday and 97 degrees Wednesday.
The Weather Service is advising residents to drink lots of fluids, stay in air-conditioned areas, avoid the sun and check up on friends and family in order to avoid dangerous heat illnesses.
Southern Californians can look forward to getting outside without melting this weekend, however, with expected highs in the 70s and 80s.

During a spring practice, when he made this run, we all knew Dillon Baxter would be a handful on the field. Who knew that he’d be this much of a handful off the field as well?
Baxter, already suspended for the season opener at Hawaii for violating team rules (coach Lane Kiffin is still debating whether he will travel with the team), allegedly lied to former Athletic Director Mike Garrett about other schools illegally contacting him.
Right after the NCAA handed down its sanctions to USC, a university compliance officer sent letters to the Pac-10 alleging that five schools had inappropriately contacted the freshman phenomenon.  The schools denied those allegations and Garrett then sent letters of apology to Florida, Alabama, Washington, Oregon and Fresno State.
But now, information has come to the surface that those schools actually never did contact Baxter. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, ESPN.com’s Shaun Assael obtained a letter dated June 24, 2010, signed by Baxter that was included with Garrett’s apology.
In the letter, Baxter says he discussed his plans with friends at the school and that no schools ever contacted him. However, he also wrote that he went to receivers coach John Morton’s office and said that other schools contacted him.
“The fact [sic] are not such. I was not contacted by other schools but it was me talking to my friends about what I was going to do,” Baxter wrote.  “I am truly sorry for all of the chaos I have caused and it was not my intention to implicate other schools and their coaching staffs. I realize my actions do not represent how I was raised and the type of person I am. I would like everyone to know that I will do a better job thinking before I act.”

USC continues to exemplify academic clout, as the university recently rose to No. 23 in the nation for “best national universities,” according to the U.S. News & World Report. This marks yet another milestone achievement for a university that has undergone such dramatic changes in the last decade.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
With its rise in rank, USC also pulled academically ahead of crosstown rival UCLA. It was not long ago that UCLA was considered to be the most reputable university in Los Angeles. In fact, for some, it might still be.
But with major advances in the quality of USC’s undergraduate curriculum, extensive research opportunities for students and increased fundraising for its professional schools, this achievement signifies how far USC has come as an institution in such a short amount of time. USC is not only ahead of UCLA, but in the top 1 percent of all American colleges and universities in terms of selectivity.
Although this achievement signifies great success for our university, President C.L. Max Nikias knows we cannot stop here.
“Our goal is to continue our momentum — and even to escalate it — in order to make this one of the most productive and influential universities in an epoch of global change,” he said.
Although the Steven B. Sample era was particularly distinct, we still have significant of progress to make if USC is to reach the highest echelons of academic excellence. Our university — with its sweeping innovations, stellar faculty, prominent urban location and ambitious student body — should aim for nothing less than becoming the leading private research university in the United States.
One way to continue our university’s momentum is to compare our success to other institutions of equal or higher acclaim. As far as we have come as a private research university, USC still ranks behind several California universities, including Stanford (No. 5), California Institute of Technology (No. 7) and UC Berkeley (No. 22). It is in our best interest to emulate what these three have accomplished and what USC has yet to achieve.
It is not enough for USC to gradually lure students away from higher-ranked institutions. Our efforts should make the decision between Stanford and USC one that students cannot answer so easily in terms of academics.
To accomplish this, the university must be quick to discern the top priorities of prospective students. Whether it be an esteemed faculty, a safe and lively campus environment, access to internship opportunities or financial support, our university leaders should constantly look for ways to strengthen areas where we fall behind while emphasizing the areas where we excel.
Sorting through the university’s strengths and weaknesses will become a part of a larger public relations agenda in which USC must continue to enhance its image among high school counselors across the nation. Since the views of high school counselors were included in the rankings for the first time, it is imperative to ensure our university recruiters know the facts and market them in a way that will attract the best and brightest high school seniors.
Marketing the university requires our recruiters first to be explicit about the positive attributes that characterize the Trojan community: elite academic and athletic programs, generous research support, proximity to the film and entertainment capital of the world and, of course, the famous Southern California weather.
Recruiters must then be bold and honest about the challenges the university still faces and the steps it is taking to address them. For example, issues of campus safety and surrounding crime are better addressed than ignored. Though a challenge, even these obstacles can be used to the university’s advantage. University ambassadors would do well to suggest that though the community surrounding USC is very urban it gives students an opportunity to participate in valuable outreach programs. In fact, a striking majority of undergraduates perform community service every year. These facts can turn cause for hesitation into a beneficial recruiting tool.
Dedicated USC affiliates might say national rankings are not to be taken too seriously and that by comparing ourselves to other universities and giving increased attention to recruitment efforts we detract from the university’s focus. But during a time characterized by cut-throat competition to attract the most qualified students from across the globe and with no sign of such tension diminishing, rankings and reputation are often the factors that will prompt a top-caliber student to choose one university over another. The USC administration cannot avoid this reality and still expect to enroll the future leaders of our society.
Like any other university, USC will experience setbacks along the way. Even a university that has accomplished so much so quickly cannot do everything perfectly. Yet, a university that remains confident in its abilities and also open-minded about its shortcomings is bound to become — in truth and in reputation — one of the leading institutions of the world.

Put away those text books. No need to recycle any paper. The iPad is now being introduced into one USC classroom, serving as an example for future courses to forgo the traditional paper and pen.
Journalism 584, a graduate course called “Specialized Reporting: Education, Youth and Learning” is equipping its class with iPads to produce multimedia journalism, professor Bill Celis told USC News.
“We will be blogging and reporting straight from the field,” Celis said.
Other schools like the University of Alabama and Seton University also began using the iPad this week, but as an application, not a textbook.
A company called Inkling partnered with Apple to create an application that allows iPad users to share, draw and comment on iPad texts, according to Matt MacInnis, Inkling’s founder.
Celis said he believes his class will be pushing “multimedia’s boundaries.”

All the talk these days is about the football team losing scholarships.
Yet, with the team at about 20 players below the scholarship minimum and with the scholarship sanctions not coming into effect until the 2011 season, coach Lane Kiffin decided to reward some players for their years of hard work.

Senior kicker Joe Houston, junior linebacker Ross Cumming and sophomore center Abe Markowitz received scholarships to play for the Trojans this season.
“It’s a dream come true,” Houston said. “This has been my goal besides winning the starting job. It’s a nice feeling knowing all my hard work has paid off.”
Houston’s teammate, sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, said he couldn’t have been happier for the trio.
“I’m proud of those guys. They’ve worked really hard and it’s really cool to get a chance to see them play for free,” Barkley said.

On a darker note, Kiffin confirmed that freshman running back Dillon Baxter will not travel with the team to Hawaii next week.
Kiffin suspended Baxter for the first game of the season for violating team rules and hopes this will be a learning opportunity.
“He’s had a good start to the semester and because it’s a Thursday game, he’d basically miss the whole week of school,” Kiffin said. “So it’s more important for him to stay here and we hope he’s learned his lesson and that this is extremely hard on him.”
Kiffin did acknowledge that USC is a different team when Baxter is on the field, but thinks that Baxter’s actions were severe enough to keep him out of the first game.
“There is a ‘Dillon Factor’ like you’ve heard us refer before with Reggie,” Kiffin said. “When he’s banged up or not in there, there is a difference. He does things other guys don’t exactly do. He’s very unique and we’d be running different players if he were playing this game.” 
—
In injury news, cornerback Shareece Wright and quarterback Mitch Mustain kept it light at practice yesterday. Mustain felt a pain in his rib after throwing a ball in drills and Wright experienced some pain in his hip. Neither injury is expected to be serious; but with limited numbers, Kiffin is taking caution, especially with Wright as the secondary prepares for a high-octane-passing Hawaii offense.
“We just want to make sure we manage our guys as best we can,” Kiffin said. “Our DBs have done a lot of running and as you look at our DBs preparing for this week, we have a big game plan with all the spread offense Hawaii does, so they will have to do a lot of running in the next few practices.”
congrats to those players sticking it out!

West Hollywood’s Sunset Strip is home to some of Los Angeles’ most historic music venues. The Roxy Theatre, Key Club, Whisky-A-Go-Go and numerous others are all synonymous with Los Angeles’ consistently vibrant music scene.
Bands such as Led Zeppelin, Guns N’ Roses, Black Sabbath and many others have all graced the venues’ stages and wandered the street that was once infamous for the debauched rockstar nightlife.
The Sunset Strip, while still an extremely well-known hub for Los Angeles nightlife, entertainment and tourism, has somewhat diminished in popularity since the rock ‘n’ roll heydays of the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, as areas like Silverlake and Echo Park have begun to dominate the city’s growing alternative and indie rock music scene.
In an effort to both revitalize the area and pay homage to the Sunset Strip community, the boulevard is now home to a new tradition, the Sunset Strip Music Festival. Now in its third year, the festival will draw thousands of fans to West Hollywood for a three-day celebration of music and entertainment beginning Aug. 26.
For the festival, the area of Sunset Boulevard between Doheny Drive and San Vincente will be closed off to allow for multiple stages, street vendors and concertgoers. More than 90 bands are set to perform, including Lonely Drunks Club, Yeti, Reason to Rebel and Cast of Kings.
As if the Sunset Strip’s namesake alone does not bring back enough memories, the festival’s headliners include experienced and legendary performers like Slash and The Smashing Pumpkins. The former top hat-wearing Guns N’ Roses guitarist, has been designated as this year’s festival honoree, joining the likes of award winner and Sunset Strip veteran Ozzy Osborne and Sunset Strip club owners Lou Adler, Mario Maglieri and Elmer Valentine.
In addition to performing on the outdoor stage Saturday night, Slash will be honored for his musical legacy at the House of Blues Thursday. The event includes a Slash tribute act and the city of West Hollywood has declared that Aug. 26 will be known as “Slash Day.”
Following Slash on the outdoor stage is the world-renowned ’90s alternative rock group, The Smashing Pumpkins. With multiple hit albums and numerous popular songs, front man and founder Billy Corgan and his band were extremely influential in the ’90s alternative rock scene. Although Corgan is the only remaining original member of the band, as the lineup has shifted numerous times throughout the band’s lifetime, The Smashing Pumpkins will likely be a huge draw for festival attendees.
The band is currently touring behind its newest album Teargarden by Kaleidyscope Vol. 1: Songs for a Sailor, but will undoubtedly perform classic songs off albums such as Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.
Although the festival’s headliners are veterans of the music industry, the festival will feature younger bands of varying genres and styles. Rappers Common and Kid Cudi will perform on the second outdoor stage immediately preceding The Smashing Pumpkins’ performance.
Other outdoor-stage performers include the alternative rock group Neon Trees, indie-pop kids Saint Motel, pop-rapper Travie McCoy and the over-the-top glam-rock act Steel Panther.
While the aforementioned artists will all perform at one of the two main outdoor stages,  located on opposite ends of the Strip, there will also be numerous free shows within the established music venues,  with tickets costing $20-30. Local reggae-rock group Tomorrows Bad Seeds will play at The Roxy from 11 p.m. to midnight Saturday night and rock group The Shrill will take the stage at 10:30 p.m. at Whisky-A-Go-Go down the street.
This combination of four well-known indoor music venues, outdoor stages, food, merchandise and beer vendors is what sets the Sunset Strip Music Festival apart from other exclusively outdoor festivals.
A general admission ticket costs $49.50 in advance and $65 at the gate and allows entry for all of Saturday’s shows, which include the outdoor stages as well as free access to the Roxy, Key Club, Cat Club and Whisky-A-Go-Go. Individual tickets are also being sold for Thursday and Friday’s shows.
The festival and its diverse lineup of bands, young and old, will undoubtedly keep the vibrant and wild spirit of the Sunset Strip alive.

For junior Greg Woodburn, running is more than just putting in miles.
The confidence and friendships that evolve from running have propelled Woodburn to share his passion with children around the world through his organization, Give Running.

Give Running, founded by Woodburn in 2006, collects pairs of running shoes, old and new, and donates them to underprivileged youth.
Woodburn, a native of Ventura, Calif., majoring in history, has been running competitive track and cross-country since elementary school. A series of injuries, however, forced him to forego competing in his sophomore year of high school.
His absence from the sport made him realize how much running had given him self-esteem, confidence and new friends.
Living by the mantra, “while running is hard, not running is harder,” Woodburn decided to  help others by providing them with the proper gear to share his passion for running. This decision lead to the birth of Give Running.
Woodburn started the project with the goal of collecting 100 pairs of running shoes by Christmas in 2006. He placed collection boxes at local schools, gyms and sport stores, and personally gathered, washed and sent more than 500 pairs of running shoes to children in Sudan, Uganda and Kenya.
The emotionally charged feedback he received from the children was overwhelming, he said. For some kids, it was the first pair of shoes that they had ever owned.
Now, his holiday project is a full-fledged operation with five chapters throughout the United States, including one at USC, that have collectively acquired, cleaned and distributed 7,254 pairs of shoes to children spanning from Los Angeles to Mali.
Woodburn has received awards for his dedication to public service, including a Liberty Mutual Scholarship that honors students who initiate a service or volunteer program that directly impacts or actively engages their campus community.
The USC chapter also has its own donation box located in the lobby of the Lyon Center and is working to collect used running and athletic shoes from all sports teams on the days they receive new shoes.
The main obstacle that the organization faces shipping costs. The nonprofit operates on a minimal budget; therefore, it must ask individuals to pay for their own shipping costs when sending shoes. Although the organization’s members attempt to help fundraise in any way that it can, it still presents a difficult problem.
“I feel that this has helped us maintain a very high quality of shoes we donate,” Woodburn said. “People will make sure they are in good condition before mailing them. Recycling those in poor shape would just add weight to the shipment.”
By 2020, Give Running hopes to collect, clean and donate more than 500,000 pairs of shoes. Woodburn said that he would also like to work with a corporate sponsor to ensure that about 25 percent of that goal can be met with new shoes. Other endeavors include establishing donation sites in all 50 states and other countries as well as building the first all-weather surface track in at least one city.
Despite having witnessed Give Running grow into something exponentially bigger than himself, Woodburn still has a familiar feeling whenever he steps up to a sink to scrub down another pair of shoes.
“I think about the young boy or girl who is going to receive that pair of shoes … I also think about the person who has worn the pair of shoes previously and how, while the giver and receiver of this pair of shoes may never meet face-to-face, through this pair of shoes they meet, in a sense, foot-to-foot,” Woodburn said.
The USC chapter of Give Running will be holding its first open meeting Wednesday, Sept. 1 at 6 p.m. in the Track and Field office.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate unanimously approved Eric Lee for treasurer Tuesday night during the first USG Senate meeting of the year.
Starting out · Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Nehi Ogbevoen and Parliamentarian Ben Toribio preside over the first USG meeting of the year Tuesday. - Heather Lee | Daily Trojan 
Lee, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, was nominated to be the 2010-2011 treasurer after former treasurer Brian Anderson resigned for personal reasons. Anderson helped USG look for a new treasurer and recommended Lee for the job.
“No one was in school, so we had to make a decision quickly,” USG President Chris Cheng said. “The funding board applications were already starting to come in so we needed a new treasurer as fast as possible.”
The search included both people within and without USG. A total of 10 people were considered, and then the executive board narrowed the applicants down to three candidates. The executive board had to make a decision based on people they thought were fit for the job, Cheng said.
“Eric definitely stood out above the rest,” he said. “He had strong leadership qualifications, great academics, extensive experience with various organizations on campus and is a quick thinker. We needed someone who could learn the job quickly and someone who was committed.”
Cheng also said that USG was amazed at his focus on teamwork and commitment to fundraise for the USG endowment, which officers hope will help lower the student fee while allowing USG to continue putting more money into programming and funding student organizations.
“A lot of our applicants were qualified,” USG Vice President Nehi Ogbevoen said. “But what made Eric unique was that he would go above and beyond his role as a treasurer. He has potential to be a great leader of funding board because of his prior work experience and experience working on philanthropic organizations such as Dance Marathon.”
Lee said he expects to encounter challenges in regard to learning the policies and systems of USG, but he is optimistic and had already started learning the material even before he was chosen.
“Right now I’m just trying to get acclimated to the position and to learn the ropes,” Lee said. “I just want to be a good mentor to the funding board directors and make sure that the financial aspects of the school are running properly and smoothly.”
Lee also said he expects difficulties in terms of communicating with the various student organizations and learning about their funding needs. He plans to hold a seminar explaining the various resources that are available to student organizations and how the funding process works.
“The treasurer should be a good face for the organization because when student groups or administrators have questions about money, they will ask the treasurer,” Cheng said. “Eric has the ability to handle all kinds of situations. We want the organizations to get the money they deserve through funding, and Eric can guide them along the way.”

Students can now track Campus Cruiser, view USC maps and have access to a multitude of other university related information — all on one convenient application.
Access - Users can utilize these features without Internet access. Photo courtesy of  Mithun Baphana 
i-USC, created by graduate student Mithun Baphana, was launched Aug. 11.
Baphana is studying electrical engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering and independently created this application over the summer.
Baphana, who also graduated from USC this summer, began work on this application at the start of the summer semester. He created the application because he wanted to provide USC with something useful and long-lasting before the conclusion of his time at school.
“I wanted to give something back to my fellow Trojans,” Baphana said.
This application is designed to provide USC students and community members with pertinent information that they can view with just the click of a button.
Current features include the ability to view the USC Arts and Events calendar, read USC News and the Daily Trojan, view USC maps, track trams and Campus Cruiser and use the faculty and student directories.
Within the next couple of weeks, Baphana will be adding access to the USC Credit Union, Blackboard and discounts for USC students in the local community.
The application can be downloaded for free on Apple products such as the iPhone or iTouch.
Baphana is also working on expanding this application to Blackberry and Android users.
“It will be helpful for students, alumni and the USC community,” Baphana said.
The graduate student released the application through the Mobile Entertainment Software Corporation, a mobile application development company he founded in February 2009. He is currently developing other applications through this corporation.
After originally designing i-USC, Baphana had to send it to Apple for approval before it was offered in the Apple store for customers. Currently, the application is still in its beta stage, where it will remain until he adds the finishing touches.
Presently, there are only two other USC-related applications in Apple’s App Store: a USC Athletics application, which costs $4.99, and a free iTommyCam application for weather information and watching Tommy Trojan.
Students who own iPhones are already expressing interest in the application.
Blake Byfuglin, a sophomore majoring in biochemistry, said she already uses her iPhone to access USC information but has to go online to do so.
“The fact that I could just look at an application on my phone and not have to use Safari makes it so much more convenient,” Byfuglin said.
Though she said she is excited about the potential of the new application, she would like to see the main menu have a button for athletic schedules.
“I want to go to all the games but I just don’t always know when or where they are,” she said.
Alison Root, a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts (critical studies), said she is most excited about being able to track USC transportation.
“I would definitely use it for tracking Campus Cruiser,” she said.
Root also suggested that a button be added for viewing the current traffic situation on and around USC.
Baphana plans on continuing to work on the application in the coming months, adding new features and taking feedback from students and faculty members.
“I will change a few things to make it more user-friendly,” he said.
very useful to USC students.
best wishes,
go ahead… ahead… ahead…
Hope that is the start of many more for you!  Fight on.
This app is awesome.. It’s like having USC, at my fingertips. Being an alumnus, this app keeps me “in the loop”.  Thanks!!!!!!!

Students now have a new incentive for making good grades through the online company Ultrinsic, a New York-based website offering an online betting forum for select college students.
Betting on success - Goli Hiekali, a junior majoring in communication, studies at her desk. Students who do better in their classes might have a shot at earning money with Ultrinsic’s new program. Heather Lee | Daily Trojan
Ultrinsic provides students with the opportunity to place bets on their grades and to win money depending on the grades they earn. For example, if a student takes a math class and believes that he is capable of getting an A, the student would place a bet of $100 for the grade. The student would be required to pay an immediate down payment of $25. If he earns the A as projected, the student would receive the full $100, earning $75. However, if he does not achieve the A grade, Ultrinsic would then keep the $25 the student originally paid.
Some students believe the program will help them work harder for their grades.
“I think it’s a good motivator for good grades. Everyone wants more money,” said Lee J. Cotton, a junior majoring in communication. “If you’re pretty sure you’re going to get an A, it’s an easy way to get money.”
Ultrinsic requires students to verify their grades by sending in their transcripts or providing official proof they acquired the grade they reported.
Student Records Manager Jim Feigert said the university will not release a transcript to anyone without the student’s consent. Even though it is up to the student what they do with the transcript, Feigert said that gambling is frowned upon.
“Your record is very private and very valuable,” Feigert said. “The university has a responsibility to maintain that security to that document … [Ultrinsic] sounds like a nice way of them coming up with an excuse to legitimize gambling. However, it is up to the student who receives their grades and records.”
Steve Wolf, the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Ultrinsic, believes his business will revolutionize the way students approach school. Thirty-six universities from across the nation were chosen to participate in their program, including USC, New York University and University of Pennsylvania.
Last year, approximately 600 students participated in the program from NYU and Penn.
“We tried to get a broad spectrum of schools based on geography, academic excellence and sports teams,” Wolf said.
Despite criticism from various organizations, Wolf discounts claims of gambling aimed at Ultrinsic.
“I cannot think of a definition of gambling that defines us,” Wolf said. “Gambling is when you take on a financially risky transaction without any control over the outcome. Studying is inside the student’s control and it has more benefits than just the financial.”
Yet, some students say the success of the program depends on the person who is making the bet.
“In the beginning, the motivation is strong, but after a while it dies down. It depends if you have self-motivation,” said Kevin Fu, a freshman majoring in business administration, who said he would be willing to bet money on his grades.
Feigert cautions students in regard to releasing their information to third parties and emphasizes that the university will not release any information independently.
“By just allowing anybody in to access your information electronically, that opens up a whole floodgate of concerns for us,” Feigert said. “We aren’t going to let that be something that is automatically or easily done by a third party.”
Ultrinsic has two approaches to garnering student participation: campus representatives and a referral program, in which a student can refer a friend and receive 5 percent of the money his friend wins. If the friend loses, then the student who originally referred the friend does not lose anything.
“The only possibility that we would lose money is [if] the program is so motivational to students that they just do awesome,” Wolf said. “If that’s the case, we could make the program harder, but better than that, we would get funding from the government because then we’d be the solution to schooling.”
I’d wager (no pun intended) that most students who engage in this, probably get good grades. It’d be a shame to wager bad grades. You got to be foolish to gamble on something you’re uncertain of, or inconsistent about. But nonetheless, I’m disgusted with this Ultrinsic “grade incentive” scam. I know the economy is bad, but it is during these times that confidence tricks, snake oil salesmen, and other hustlers lurk about to take advantage of the young and naive.

Chris Koss remembers the chant of “Don’t be last, don’t be last” as he was handed a bottle of alcohol at a fraternity event last year.
Koss, a senior majoring in psychology, also remembers standing in silence for hours in the sweltering heat of a pitch-black basement while wearing a suit.
Memories of hazing at an unnamed fraternity led Koss to create the organization Greeks Against Hazing. This week, some fraternity members are wearing shirts that say “Anti-Hazing” around campus.
“Hazing is secretive [and] coercive,” Koss said.
He is also the president of Theta Chi fraternity, which deems itself a “non-hazing” fraternity. Koss said he joined Theta Chi after his experience with hazing in another fraternity.
He said he loves his brothers and fraternity but wants Greek life at USC to be held to a higher standard. Koss plans to hold seminars and discussion groups about hazing, inviting all Greek members to be educated about the issue.
“The only way to stop hazing in my mind is if everyone agrees that hazing is a bad thing.  That’s what I want to do,” Koss said.
So Koss is striving to make hazing a thing of the past for all the fraternities on The Row, because, he said, the activity hurts not only the house’s pledge class but all fraternities.
“It’s really rooted in the egos of the people who are the hazers,” he said. “I think it’s hurting the greek system as a whole.”
Interfraternity Council President Eric Ronan said that the idea of stopping hazing is already shared among all fraternities.
“There were no instances where any fraternity was caught for hazing. The IFC has a strict no hazing policy here at USC,” Ronan said.
As president of IFC, Ronan required to report any hazing incidences to the police.
“Here in California it is against the law and, therefore, people are not participating in it anymore,” Ronan said. “People always hear about rumors, [but] I wouldn’t say any of that is true.”
Although hazing has a vague definition at different universities, the office of USC Student Organizations lists branding the body, peer pressure, sleep deprivation and forcing substances on pledges as examples of hazing situations.
“Hazing is physical abuse,” said Daniel Shia, a junior majoring in business administration and member of Sigma Chi fraternity. “We try to have the pledges have a pride [of] their own rather than kind of force them into it.”
Lucas Biging, a senior majoring in geography, is also a member of Sigma Chi. He said his fraternity has a policy like Theta Chi’s but admits such no-hazing practices are a rarity on The Row.
“We don’t haze … We’re one of the few though,” Biging said.
Despite the efforts of IFC, various fraternity and sorority members who wished to remain anonymous admitted that hazing still exists.
“I had some people come up to me and say, ‘There’s no such thing as fraternities that don’t haze,’” Koss said. “It sorts of gets passed down through the years and becomes the status quo.”
Only Theta Chi members have been seen wearing the “anti-hazing” shirts, Koss said.
Shia doesn’t think students have to wear such shirts to show that they oppose hazing, however.
“I think it’s an image issue really. [But] nobody likes to be hazed,” Shia said.
And although Ronan acknowledges that hazing might be a part of the fraternity image, he says fraternities are more about making close friends than drinking and partying.
“I feel like I have a hundred best friends,” Ronan said. “You have the opportunity to get to know someone on a more personal level, things you wouldn’t tell anyone else. You have people around that you can trust your life with.”
What happened to the good ol’ fun?
Great publicity stunt
As a parent, I know for a fact that a sorority engaged in hazing. My daughter was physically abused by these girls with sleep deprivation and only water to drink for over a 12 hr period. After all was said and done and several hundred of dollars paid for “fees” she was not included in the group.
Drink pledge!

The recently opened University Gateway apartment complex does not live up to its promises of luxury living, according to many students now living in the building.
Among the complaints from residents of Gateway, located at the corner of Figueroa Street and Jefferson Boulevard, are problems with unfinished ceilings, unsanded furniture, a lack of storage space and overhead lighting, difficulty reaching management and parking woes.
Daily Trojan file photo
“I think most people can agree that Gateway promises things but does not deliver,” said Dina Nooh, a junior majoring in business administration.
In general, Nooh said, the apartments in Gateway are not built to match the quality of an apartment that costs more than $1,000 per month — the price of rent for leases signed last spring.
“The ceilings just seem unfinished; they’re uneven and have little holes [and] cracks. One of my friends said she has nails coming out of hers,” Nooh said. “There does not seem to be enough cabinets for all our stuff and the under-the-bed drawers are smaller than they look, and the desk does not come with any drawers.”
Urban Partners, LLC, the company managing Gateway, said the ceiling appearance is done on purpose to create an “urban” feel.
“With regard to the apartment ceiling concerns, they are a unique artchtectural [sic] element of the building and have been designed to create an ‘urban loft’ feel for the units,” wrote John Hrovat, partner of Urban Partners and a USC alumnus, in an e-mail.
One of the promises made to residents was the guarantee of free parking; Gateway residents receive free parking at the USC Parking Center, but parking at the actual Gateway complex costs extra money.
This, according Makhala Greene-Robinson, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was not communicated to students when they signed the lease.
“We didn’t really know where [the free parking] was,” Greene-Robinson said. “It was at the Parking Center, which was way too far.”
According to Hrovat, more than 700 parking spaces are offered at the Gateway complex and 400 spaces are located at the Parking Center, located on 35th Street and Grand Avenue.
“To ensure our residents’ convenience, our off-site parking is operated by USC and includes a shuttle service to campus and to University Gateway,” Hrovat wrote.
Another problem that students have run into, Greene-Robinson said, is dealing with management to get issues fixed in a timely manner.
“Management is just a little hard to deal with at times.”  Greene-Robinson said. “They don’t care about your issues.”
Urban Partners, however, said the number of inquiries that management is receiving is normal given the high amount of students moving in at the same time.
“We continue to make adjustments to service our residents in the best possible way and look forward to continued interaction with each of our residents,” Hrovat wrote.
Gateway is now offering leases at $899, hundreds of dollars lower than the price given to students last year.
“It was annoying that the price dropped,” said Evan, a resident who did not disclose his last name. “You’re paying a premium price.”
Hrovat said that any changes in prices are reflected by a change in amenities offered in those apartments.
“Many of the leases signed last spring were for prime units on top floors,” Hrovat wrote. “The majority of University Gateway’s most luxurious apartments were leased at higher rates [last spring].”
In general, Evan said he believes Gateway could start to improve the situation by communicating more with students.
“I would want a quicker reaction time, or actually just responding,” Evan said of complaints from tenants. “I think the management is a novice group of people, so they’re trying to figure out how it’s going to work.”
In response to the influx of inquiries, Gateway management is working to create a more efficient system for giving feedback to students.
“We are also eliminating desktop computers in favor of tablet laptops so that the property’s staff can better respond to concierge desk requests and can interact directly with the resident,” Hrovat said.
Oh, and you know what else? When I moved into my “brand new” apartment, I found out it had already been occupied. You know how I found out? There were popcorn kernels ground into the living room apartment, a bag full of trash in the kitchen, long black hairs in the shower and sinks, and, I kid you not, used feminine hygiene products crumpled up in the bathroom cupboard.
Classy.
Attention DT: management blatantly lied to you when they said that the more expensive leases are for “prime” units on the top floors. I live in a horrible unit on the 4th floor–next to the alarmed staircases and the breezeway where, since there is NO service in the building, people talk on their cell phones all night–and I’m paying $1,030 a month. Prime unit my ASS. I am paying $130 more than my roommate to live in the same apartment. How is that okay?
Another gateway tenant here. Pretty much every resident I’ve spoken to so far has a list of complaints/and or disappointments. I’ve already begun to advise people I know not to sign leases here for spring or next year simply to save them from having to go through with what we have. This place made a ton of promises to all of us just to get us to sign and didn’t follow through. As someone else said, this place fooled us all with their marketing.
This place is great!  I love my suite mates and I feel special living here.  It convienent and high end.  When I have told people on campus I live here they all say how lucky I am and how they want to live here next year.  Maybe instead of complaining you should address your concerns and offer insight to change.
Nice try by a Gateway rep here to try and save face.  Pure desperation.  Face the facts, this place has not delivered on any of it’s promises!
you guys went way too easy on them in the article. After you sign a lease here they no longer care about you. worst service ever. Trying to talk to management is like talking to a f***ing door. If you get in an elevator here and ask anybody what they think of the building you’ll get a real idea. They promissed us the world and they’re literally bending us over and f***ing us from behind.
Well, one thing I should say is that they are listening to what we are saying.  They called me within the hour of my post yesterday and fixed many of my issues no longer than an hour later. They actually really do want to help is what it seems like and the people that came and helped were all very nice
Luxury Living????   Gateway is a joke.  False promises and scams!  I wouldn’t be surprised if this place is empty next year.  I won’t be living here.
Very angry and disappointed!
I agree completely with all of the complaints. Gateway has been nothing short of abysmal in their attempts to manage this building. Much false advertising coupled with unprofessionalism and slashed prices will ensure that they have few returning tenants who signed early.
“We are also eliminating desktop computers in favor of tablet laptops so that the property’s staff can better respond to concierge desk requests and can interact directly with the resident,” 
How will this improve anything? The staff needs to be trained properly and the horrible peer to peer communication system wastes a lot of time
“With regard to the apartment ceiling concerns, they are a unique artchtectural [sic] element of the building and have been designed to create an ‘urban loft’ feel for the units,”
A horrible excuse for pouring cost-effective concrete slabs that are cracking and have many serious imperfections. 
As far as management, they say they are really busy and that your concerns will be addressed shortly as they begin to unwrap promotional t shirts.
what does usc have to say about all of these housing woes people are having? it’ll be hard to get their opinion on it, but if the DT can do it, then it would good to know if these sort of issues r why USC would like to control the local housing market.
Gateway is quickly gaining a reputation for not having principles or ethics when it comes to good business.  I was  disappointed when I heard about the drastic drop in rent price.  It’s simple, when you promise something to your customers, especially those who are loyal and sign leases early on (like my apartment and many of our friends did last year), you should keep your promises.  What kind of message does it send to us when we hear that prices are slashed at the last minute to draw more residents in (who are probably less likely to keep their leases next year when they find another cheaper last-minute housing deal anyway), when we signed up early and are paying $150/month more?  The lack of principles, not even the difference in price, is what upsets me the most.  Gateway’s actions are basically telling us all to wait until the last minute and see if they’ll drop the price again.  That really doesn’t seem like the best way to keep customers.
Also I, like many other residents I know, was completely under the impression that the all retail shops downstairs, the amenities we are paying so much to utilize, would be completed when we arrived this fall.  So far, there are only two ready.  Again, this is not the first time that Gateway has been vague with the details.  They need to figure out what kind of image they would like to present to the USC community, because so far it has not been an entirely positive or promising one.
Gateway promised either a bike or a $150 Visa Gift Card (your choice) when my roommate and I signed our lease. We even signed something to ensure that we would get this. When we asked about this, they said they were not responsible for this promotion – it was done by their old management. That seems a little ridiculous considering the fact that companies change management all the time but don’t compromise customer satisfaction. 
Also, they won’t offer any sort of discount on parking in their lot, even though it’s probably not even 1/3 full. When I asked about this, the reaction I got from one of the Gateway employees was extremely aggressive and just rude. Learn how to treat your first set of residents, or you’ll have an empty building next year.
And a correction – the USC Parking Lot is not free – its $37.50 a month. I’m sure Gateway is giving this parking free to some residents, though, because they specialize in giving discounts to certain individuals and not to others.
Oh, and my roommates don’t have light in their shower, so they’re forced to shower in the dark. This is a brand new building – what’s the excuse? And when we went down to put in the work order, we were told that they “haven’t gotten to it yet.” The lady at the front desk then pointed to a HUGE stack of other work orders…
I’d like to hear what Gateway has to say about all of this.
Gateway basically is trying to put lipstick on a fat pig. They’re all show and marketing, but no actual superior product.
Gateway met NONE of mine or my roommates expectations. We were promised the world by our leasing officer and when you actually move in, it’s a straight jab to the gut. The premium lofts they refer to don’t even exist, there is very little variable difference between the sizes of the apartments, this point that gateway is making is pure spin. The beds feel like they were made for 8 year olds, not college students. What’s worse, is that the whole benefit of supplied furniture is just a guise because they won’t store it for you if you don’t actually want to have the baby bed. You’d think that a premium loft that costs 1100 per bed would at least have amenities like hot water for the showers. Gateway does not. It purposely cuts off the heating at quarter power to most likely cheap out on the residents. Curious, when the first students they ever have are pretty important for their success. It would have been nice if they had a pool or something in one of those huge courtyards, but instead it looks more like a massive concrete breezeway. 
Gateway is Soviet living at its finest.
I suggest all of us that signed early and are paying a much higher rate, boycott signing next year unless it is lower than the published rate.  Also, I suggested they give us free parking since the said they could not ‘change the lease’ and they couldn’t do that either.  WIll NOT be at Gateway next year and will suggest friends stay away, unless they address some of our concerns.

Korean-American stand-up comedian Margaret Cho can now add another notch on her belt for a brazen, new conquest: making her very own music album.
Photo courtesy of Ken Phillips Publicity Group Inc
Collaborating with the likes of Fiona Apple, Andrew Bird, Patty Griffin and Ani DiFranco, the 41-year-old comic debuts a perky style and surprisingly pleasant voice in her upcoming album Cho Dependent, released today.
The release of the 13-track record will be followed by a national tour starting Aug. 26, which will include a stop in Los Angeles at the Wiltern Theatre in December. Each show promises a night of laughs, complete with Cho’s new stand-up routines and live performances of her brand new melodies.
Cho might be considered a rookie in the music industry, but that doesn’t mean she hasn’t got a clue of what she’s doing. Rounding up some of the best in the business — all of whom she considers her musical heroes — Cho writes spicy and ironic lyrics that cover topics ranging from a bad case of head lice to awkward genitals to calling work stoned, accompanying them with catchy jams reminiscent of the ’60s.
Good comedy in one hand and good music in the other: Bring the two together and we’ve got ourselves an explosive revelation.
Needless to say, Cho Dependent newly realizes the performer as not only a musician but also a pioneer paving the way for a genre of stifled snorts and guitar riffs.
Always a music enthusiast, Cho admitted in interviews that Madonna played a big role in her picking up the guitar. She said she saw Madonna playing the instrument and thought, “Well, if that bitch can do it, so can I.”
That marked the beginning of an exciting journey into an unforeseen landscape.
The opening track, “Intervention,” which is a collaboration with Canadian indie-rock band Teagan and Sara, kicks off the album with a head-nod inducing beat. The overall song sounds like a typical Teagan and Sara song with guitar-heavy instrumentals and rock drumbeats. The lyrics, as written by Cho, defy the duo’s usually sentimental punch lines, however. A comedic story about a girl whose friends set up an intervention for her troubling meth addiction, the song is true-to-life on a different level.
One part of the song includes an animated exchange between a stuttering Sara and a messy Cho, who gets so worked up in denial that she pukes in Sara’s jack o’ lantern (with sound effects and everything). This song is the precedent for the rest of the album as the perfect triad of soundly tunes, overboard voice acting and belly-grabbing story lines.
Another notable track is “Hey Big Dog,” a collaboration with Apple, Griffin and Ben Lee. This is where Cho proves herself as not only a funny lyric composer but also one with vocal prowess. Singing with the legendary Apple, Cho’s own voice does not pale in comparison but proves itself worthy and melodic.
Cho takes a stab at dark comedy in “I’m Sorry” with Andrew Bird, which — set to a bouncy guitar arpeggio and Bird’s trademark whistling — has an unrepentant Cho “sincerely apologizing” to an ex-lover for setting his house on fire and shooting him in the face, among other things.
For the sentimental piano ballad, aptly titled “Eat Shit and Die” and featuring musician Grant-Lee Philips, Cho blogged on her website about the therapeutic effects of writing the song to get over a heartbreak.
“There’s nothing else you can do, but write a song,” she wrote. “The song is like a spell, cast over the heartbreak — banishing it forever.”
This goes to show that, while many people might quickly dismiss Cho’s album as just another attempt to be ironic and funny, there is actually more than what meets the eye.
Cho proves herself to be more than just a crasher in the music industry; rather, she is an up-and-coming musician who understands the importance of putting an honest heart into the process of making music.
After all, just because it’s funny doesn’t mean it’s not sincere.

Peter Lee Johnson, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance, is at the forefront of the rebellion that our generation heralds, but he once shared in the same uncertainty that most college applicants face amid the cautionary din of overzealous parents.
From the age of 4 Johnson was immersed in classical music, a hobby that eventually led him to  join the Seattle Youth Symphony at age 11. To Johnson, the world of music was not discriminatory; it had no genres, no boundaries — just soul.
“Whenever anyone was playing music, I would always see if I could sit in with them — it didn’t matter the style,” Johnson said.
In high school, he played jazz violin but initially looked to USC’s School of Cinematic Arts in order to pursue filmmaking in conjunction with film composition.
“I had written off music as a serious option in college because I only knew of colleges with classical or jazz programs,” Johnson said. “These are great for some people, but I never could see myself playing in an orchestra for a full time job.”
Very few programs promised to craft his contradictory persona of a modern musician, one who utilizes classical roots in order to become more relevant. Traditionally, students join classical programs because they instill good habits and lay the foundation for eventual experimentation based on knowledge of what has been done prior. This climate can stunt the organic expression that comes from a unique artist like Johnson, however.
“I would be practicing these great violin works and then start making up my own version and create new songs all the time,” Johnson said.
This is precisely what he began doing in his one-man shows, invoking classical precision with modern melody.
In the fall of his senior year of high school, Johnson heard of the popular music major, which was poised for its inaugural run at the Thorton School of Music. USC’s fledgling program is the exception, not the rule, however,  when it comes to music programs at most universities.
The problem is that most young people today have dreams of playing music in the mainstream, but have limited outlets when it comes to making that dream a reality.
In terms of pop music, I’m consistently disappointed with the mainstream, but if more pop music programs existed, prodigies like Johnson might be less likely to bow out of music early to avoid  classical education and conservatory style programs. The existence of specialized, arts-focused majors is often the linchpin for indecisive college applicants.
“If it wasn’t for USC, I probably would not be doing music officially in college,” he said.
Recently, Peter Lee Johnson performed alongside artists such as Javon Johnson, Sonos and the Luminario Ballet at USC’s Spark Multimedia Showcase. On stage, Johnson was classical and casual, a real smooth operator. But it comes from a place that is genuine and unassuming. Johnson smiles often but only to include you in the moment, not in expectation of applause.
He is radical and traditional, professional and bashful. The spotlight suits him, but Johnson is the type of artist who would just as soon play at his friend’s graduation party or Ground Zero Café. To watch Peter Lee Johnson is to watch an individual doing what he lives for.
At the Oscars, film composer Michael Giacchino gave a heartfelt acceptance speech that echoed Dustin Hoffman’s the year he accepted the Best Actor award for Kramer vs. Kramer, which recognized the nobility of being an artist.
“Listen to me: if you want to be creative, get out there and do it,” Giacchino said. It’s not a waste of time.” Quite eloquently, he spoke about the lack of support that some kids have at home, which is so crucial to the development of any artist. He made it clear that he was not subject to these restrictions as an adolescent and was consistently affirmed throughout his life, and used this platform to defy societal conceptions about creative careers.
The problem is that people assume artistic careers belong only to the names they see on billboards; but there are many individuals who have found a niche in each of these markets, allowing them to succeed on their own terms.
“People are definitely discouraged, but when I get discouraged, I just think about how many opportunities there are that have to do with music,” he said.
Recently, Peter Lee Johnson secured a job as a violinist for Mark Salling to promote Salling’s CD on Ellen and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Let us not forget, of course, that Johnson is still a sophomore at USC. He is certainly not a household name, but with relentless determination, Johnson is beginning to make music into something stable and economic.
“I know I won’t be happy unless I’m doing something with music,” he said.
For an artist, this outlook will always override any uncertainty. This is the mindset that makes the poorest of artists wealthy and carries them through the rejection and heartbreak. This is the mindset that will define our generation. And if we’re lucky, Johnson will have something to do with the soundtrack.
Peter Lee Johnson is a dreammaker.

Katy Perry became a household name in 2008 with her smash hit, “I Kissed a Girl,” and proved that she was no one-hit wonder thereafter with even more successful singles from her debut album, One of the Boys.
Now, Perry returns with her follow-up release, marking a transition from her earlier material. While most of the songs on One of the Boys could be classified as pop/rock, the songs on Teenage Dream mark Perry’s enjoyable transition into a full-fledged pop star. The songs here are designed to let the teenager inside of everyone loose and will surely bring smiles to the faces of listeners.

The second single off the record, “Teenage Dream,” gets things going strong with a soft, tender beginning before the sing-a-long chorus kicks in to get hands waving in the air. “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)” induces a party atmosphere with lines about looking back at the damage after a mischievous night. The stop-and-go guitar strumming gets feet tapping and the chorus is anthemic. Listeners will also enjoy the unexpected treat of a saxophone solo in the bridge.
Next up is the summer jam, “California Gurls,” featuring Snoop Dogg, which invaded airwaves across the country — and it’s easy to see why. The chorus commands listeners to dance and Snoop Dogg’s bridge transitions seamlessly from pop to rap.
“Firework” is Perry’s favorite track off the record, showcasing her  soulful vocals before a symphonic background complements the pre-chorus and chorus. She provides an emotional, mature vocal performance in this inspiring offering with lyrics such as Do you know that there’s still a chance for you / cause there’s a spark in you / you just got to ignite / the light / and let it shine.
Then, comes “Peacock,” the sassy, sexual and playful song that is sure to be a hit. With lyrics like Come on baby let me see / what you’re hiding underneath, it isn’t meant to change lives. What it will do, however, is get stuck in heads for days and become the next great dance floor anthem.
The fun of “Peacock” disappears with the next track, “Circle The Drain,” which harbors intense angst in Perry’s darkest track yet. Her anger at an ex-boyfriend, however, does not prevent this song from producing catchy lyrics such as I want to be your lover / not your … mother are likely to resonate with many listeners.
“The One That Got Away” slows down the tempo with some piano-driven verses and memorable melodies revolving around a young lost love. Up next is “E.T.,” perhaps the record’s best track. Perry delves into new territory here in this mash-up of sounds with ’80s throwbacks. She delivers the vocals in a stunning, robotic manner to accentuate the theme of a hypnotizing lover who seems to hold a supernatural, extraterrestrial power.
Perry shows her great range in the verses of “Who Am I Living For?,” a slower, more melodic song with a chorus that makes listeners want to shout out the lyrics at the top of their lungs while “Pearl” keeps the tempo down in a touching glimpse into the life of a person who has fallen from grace. Perry sings lines like she used to set the sails of a thousand ships / was a force to be reckoned with before the song builds up nicely in the bridge.
The penultimate track, “Hummingbird Heartbeat,” picks up the pace and sounds like it could fit right in on One of the Boys with its palm-muted guitars in the verses and a chorus to get people jumping along with the infectious drum beat.
Closing out the record is “Not Like The Movies,” the softest, slowest song Perry has released. The piano and excellent vocals help create a somber tone in this ballad about relationships that don’t have fairy tale endings and the track is able to end a mostly playful record gracefully.
Teenage Dream is bona fide Katy Perry. Unlike many pop stars, she is no act. She means what she says and understands the finesse needed to craft comedic and serious songs that fully capture her personality.
From bitter breakups to love, and from sex to disappointment, the themes on this record are universal to anyone who is or has ever been a teenager. It allows Perry and all listeners to let go of their problems for 46 minutes to enjoy the ups and downs of young life, and that’s what any pop album should do.

Featuring the electronic sounds of DJ John Tejada, the 100-plus voices of the Gay Men’s Chorus of Los Angeles positively glittered in the group’s third show, Saturday night at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

The well-dressed chorus members displayed their impressive vocal arrangements for three hours, hitting some definite high and low notes through the show, titled “Sure on this Shining Night.” In his last show with the choir, the interim artistic director and conductor Dominic Gregorio created a night of music that was both classic and contemporary. Gregorio served three years with the chorus, which has been performing for 32 years.
A collection of seven songs kicked off the affair including a performance of the event’s title piece, “Sure On This Shining Night.” While beautifully harmonic and impressive, the block of songs seemed to melt together at certain points, lacking breaks for the performers and the audience.
A sharp turn into opera songs lifted the show, however, and the energy was consistently higher thereafter. The booming operatic voice of chorus member DJ Pick was unmatched until Act 2, when the GMCLA Gay Straight Alliance Youth Choir came onstage and injected childlike life into the show.
In drastically more colorful attire than the GMCLA, the young singers proved that Glee-style singing is just as amazing in person as on television. With renditions of Madonna’s “Like A Prayer” and Lady Gaga’s “Just Dance,” the young choir lifted the audience out of its seats.
A standout young lady with pink hair and a markedly sassy walk proved to be an immediate crowd pleaser with her bringing-down-the-house Aretha Franklin voice. While the young choir lacked the polish of the men’s choir, its charisma and energy outshined any small shortcomings the group possessed harmonically.
The notable GMCLA pianist Michael Alfera proved his immense talent with some skillful beat boxing during the youth choir’s performance. His presence onstage was supremely entertaining from that point forward, as he effortlessly switched gears from piano to microphone.
Tejada’s debut song with the GMCLA, titled “The End of It All,” was 10 minutes of purely eclectic sound. The dramatic, techno-infused piece managed to be harsh and at the same time melodic, and oddly enough, it was the choir that ended up sounding harsh. By adding staccato, one word vocals to the melodious electronic background, the choir creating a unified but striking piece that managed to challenge the audience’s perception of both the choir and electronic music.
The chorus’s executive director, Hywel W. Sims, interjected to narrate several parts of the show, telling the audience that Tejada had actually changed the date of his wedding in order perform with the choir that night.
While Tejada was touted as the extraordinary part of this event, it was not his piece that was the most impactful. The chorus’ rendition of The Harvey Milk School’s Project story was a telling and poignant one. Harvey Milk was one of the most successful gay rights activists.
As the choir outlined Milk’s journey, a deep sense of appreciation for what he had done for every man in the chorus — advocating for gay rights when few others were speaking out — was palpable. Using minimal props, certain members of the choir retold Harvey Milk’s story with eloquent narration and impressively tailored movement. It quickly became apparent then that many of the men were not just singers but highly talented actors as well.
The choir closed with two songs, “True Colors” and “Will You Be There,” which the audience gave two standing ovations. The youth choir joined to perform again, and the audience erupted into applause often.
As Gregorio left the stage for the last time, he didn’t look back to the chorus members, many of whom were visibly emotional over his departure, but walked away from his masterful work of the last three years with power and grace — the same way he had carried himself as a conductor of the GMCLA that night.
Correction: 8/31/10 – A previous version of this article misidentified chorus member DJ Pick.  The error has been corrected and the story has been updated to reflect this change.  The Daily Trojan sincerely regrets the error.
The reviewer should read the program a bit more carefully before publishing.  The tenor’s name is “D.J. Pick” not “Prick”; a very embarrassing mistake.  The Daily Trojan writer also fails to mention that all of the featured musicians are USC Thornton School of Music students: the conductor, the pianists/ beatboxer, the percussionists, soloists.
