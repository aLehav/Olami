The USC Center on Public Diplomacy will award its first Public Diplomacy Innovation Prize later this spring. The first-of-its-kind prize, announced Feb. 16, is a joint effort between USC’s CPD and the U.S. Department of State.
The prize will honor a U.S. Foreign Service Officer selected by the CPD prize committee. This committee, made up of members from the CPD advisory board, will decide on a winner and finalists who, in part, have delivered “concrete results in advancing U.S. foreign policy and international cooperation across a variety of sectors” while using innovative practices, according to the CPD.
The prize committee will consider a number of factors, including an applicant’s use of technology and data and collaboration skills, when they name a winner, but CPD prize committee member and advisory board member Jonathan Woetzel said he considers three key elements the Innovation Prize recipient will possess: understanding of public diplomacy, practice of public diplomacy and the talent to combine understanding and practice.
“You can’t really separate the practice of something [and the] strategy of something from the persons and the capability you need to have,” Woetzel said.
The prize echoes the calls “for new ways to do” public policy. Barry Sanders, chair of the CPD advisory board, defined public diplomacy as “communicating with foreign publics, in the interest of your nation.”
“It’s all this idea of communicating with foreign publics. It has taken on, and it was always important, much greater importance especially with the internet and the web,” Sanders said. “Everybody in the world is capable of being independent. [It’s] not like the old days when you would have to sit down with a shortwave radio to try and get a broadcast for the BBC.”
The center, founded by Sanders in 2003 and in collaboration with the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the School of International Relations, works to further public diplomacy through research and analysis and is a professional organization dedicated to those practices. It is also constantly recognized as a top public diplomacy institute, being recognized by the U.S. Department of State with the Ben Franklin Award for Public Diplomacy in 2008.
While the center continually looks for ways to expand their reach, this prize was created via suggestion by CPD Director Jay Wang during a strategic planning session and was officially adopted by the CPD board last fall.
The prize will be awarded annually, and the awarding of it will commence with an honorarium and a ceremony to follow. The prize is supported currently by two donors and is two-thirds funded.
“I think [the prize] will encourage the bureaucracy in the Department of State to not just follow the routine of standard operating procedure and think [of] something innovative and imaginative on how to truly encourage and develop relationships with our allies and enemies through public diplomacy, through their dealings with the foreign state in the way that we create relationships,” said Loida Lewis, a CPD advisory board member.

It was the year 2000, and Al Gore’s campaign for President was struggling — stranded between embracing Bill Clinton’s identity and creating one of its own.
Robert Shrum, Democratic consultant and speechwriter for over 30 years, knew that a change was needed. So he thought up a new slogan, “The People, Not The Powerful,” a progressive, populist message that signified a break from President Clinton.
The change was met with backlash, with the Clinton camp insisting that it would doom Gore with moderate swing voters. Soon afterwards, it was scrapped. After Gore’s loss, the slogan was largely viewed as a failure, both alienating and insincere. However, according to Shrum, Gore wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post saying he wishes he had emphasized the slogan more during his campaign. 
“The struggle for Gore was not an internal one in which he was trying to be like Clinton,” Shrum, who is now the director of the Center for the Political Future at USC, said. “It was all the pressure that was coming from the President to basically say ‘I’m just running for a third Clinton term.”
Such is a theme of Shrum’s career, who, despite success on senatorial and gubernatorial campaigns and reverence as a speechwriter, lost all eight presidential campaigns he worked on and is often criticized — fairly or not — for contributing to the Democratic Party’s leftward turn and losses on a national stage.
However, politics have changed since Shrum was a speechwriter for Democratic nominee for President George McGovern in 1972, and even since Shrum left the campaign trail after John Kerry’s 2004 election loss. A new progressive movement in the Democratic Party has emerged, pushing Shrum, once a populist force in Democratic politics, towards the center of the party. 
“I haven’t changed at all. Now people would say I’m center left, and there would be people further left who would say I am insufficiently left,” Shrum said. “I’m the same person I always have been. I’m an FDR, Kennedy Democrat.”
While the party has changed over time, Shrum labels the party the same way. 
“Biden is a progressive, he’s center left and he sure stands for a lot of important and ambitious ideas,” Shrum said. “This $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill is going to achieve a huge amount of progressive change in the country.”
The political landscape in the United States has undergone shifts beyond just that of the Democratic Party. On Shrum’s first general election presidential campaign, George McGovern’s, he won one state to Richard Nixon’s 49.
“I think [a 1972 like map] is almost impossible,” Shrum said. “The country has sorted itself out in two different political blocs.”
At other points in his career, states like West Virginia were solidly Democratic. Now, Senator Joe Manchin is the last remaining statewide-elected Democrat. Shrum said that Biden, if successful, can start to make inroads in the areas that Democrats have lost, in part because of his natural appeal to white-working class, Rust Belt voters or “Reagan Democrats,” as Shrum said.
“You’ve got to make a difference in their lives. You’ve got to show them that there’s something more important than grievance politics. You’ve got to give them a sense of hope for the future,” Shrum said.
Running the Center for The Political Future
As the Director of the USC Center for the Political Future, the country’s division has provided problems, but it has also added purpose.
“It’s certainly challenging because of the polarization, but it’s also the need for what we’re trying to do, which is to get people, even if they differ, to respect each other and respect the truth,” Shrum said.
Around the country, many colleges have experienced large student protests when controversial speakers are brought on campus. Shrum is undeterred, though, dedicated to bringing people with diverse political opinions to the Center, from then Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg to Joel Pollack from Breitbart News. At USC, Shrum has not received similar backlash.
Kambiz Akhavan, the executive director of the Center for the Political Future, elaborated on Shrum’s commitment to highlight different political opinions, including the decision to bring Republican strategist Mike Murphy on as a co-director of the Center.
“The fact that he did that, brought in Mike Murphy to be a co-director, to share the top leadership position, for someone who is his adversary, who’s a Republican, with whom he disagrees on many issues, says a lot about [Shrum]’s intentions,” Akhavan said. 
However, in today’s fraught political environment, when politics can infringe on truth, bringing in speakers from all different backgrounds can become complicated. 
Shrum said that the Center has two standards for speakers: respecting truth and respecting each other. The line, though, can be unclear.
“It’s hard to come up with a single standard, but you know it when you see it, and you just have to use your judgment,” Shrum said.
As the political landscape has shifted, so have the perspectives of the students he teaches, Shrum said. 
“Students are much more deeply engaged with politics than they were in 2005 or 2006. That’s partly a reaction to Trump. It’s partly a reaction to the crises we’ve been through,” Shrum said. “Students worry a lot about what their world is going to be like when they get out, what their job prospects are going to be like, what kind of country we’re going to have.”
Shrum’s former student Jorgel Chavez, a senior majoring in political science and graduate student studying public administration, ran for office last November and was elected city councillor of Bell Gardens.  
On the first day of class with Shrum, called “Media and Message: Great Races From The Senate to the White House,” Chavez remembers walking into a standing-room only classroom, with students standing in the back, excited to hear from someone who has experience working with people like the Kennedys. 
After taking another class with Shrum, this time a public policy course, Chavez forged a relationship with him. During his campaign for City Council of Bell Gardens, a city with 40,000 people, Chavez would call Shrum to ask for advice about running a grassroots campaign, his campaign’s finances and specific situations within the campaign.
“I was always very calm, knowing that he was able to listen to me … and I’m glad that after the election results came out, I called him, and I thanked him for everything,” Chavez said.
With over 30 years in politics and 15 years in academia behind him, Shrum hopes that, with the Trump presidency behind us, the political landscape can improve.
“If we get out of this health crisis and the economy starts moving ahead, I think the chances for a more reasoned and mutually respectful politics go up,” he said.
The Center for the Political Future, he hopes, can play a small role in that. 
“I have no illusion that somehow or other, we’re single handedly going to reshape American public dialogue, but I think we can contribute to that process,” Shrum said.

It has been an entire year of quarantine and I don’t need my weekly screen time report to tell you that I have spent almost every free moment on TikTok. While it has been my go-to app for laughs, it has also been one of my favorite ways to expand my music catalog. With sounds trending from all genres, TikTok is a great way to discover new music and rediscover throwbacks. Here’s a playlist of songs, old and new, that deserve a full listen, not just a 15 or 60-second clip on TikTok.
Nelly Furtado — “Maneater”
Listening to “Maneater” will do more than take you back to playing Just Dance 4 in your living room. Coming from the same album that gave us “Promiscuous,” this Timbaland-produced track will make all femmes feel like a boss. Everyone should be worried when clubs reopen because when the girls hit the dance floor “watch out boy [they]’ll chew you up.”
Estelle feat. Kanye West — “American Boy”
“Will you be my American Boy?” Estelle asks on this 2008 Grammy Award-winning track featuring Kanye West. Even though the Fortnight parody of this song is what is currently making its rounds on TikTok, the original song is just as catchy. Traveling around the states seems like an exciting trip, who wouldn’t want to be her American Boy?
Mother Mother — “Burning Pile”
Don’t we all wish we could just throw “all [our] troubles on a burning pile?” Indie rock band Mother Mother has been putting out music for over a decade but they have grown a larger audience of listeners because of TikTok. Their song “Burning Pile” pretty much sums up how everyone is feeling a year into this pandemic. 
Anderson .Paak — “Heart Don’t Stand A Chance”
In anticipation of Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars’ upcoming album, listen to Anderson .Paak’s “Heart Don’t Stand A Chance.” With the talent for making music that feels like you’re listening to the funk and soul of the 60s, it’s no wonder the rapper won a Grammy this past Sunday for Best Melodic Rap Performance. 
Blondes — “Coming of Age”
Nottingham band Blondes grew its underground following thanks to the power of TikTok. Asking “When we’re older, and it’s over, will this be a highlight?,” Blondes reminds the listener to think about how it feels to make memories and grow up. With a nostalgic sound and lyrics, “Coming of Age” makes anyone listening feel like the main character of an indie movie. 
Reyanna Maria — “So Pretty”
What started off as a producer’s challenge duet, soon became the boss-b anthem of TikTok. At just 19 years old, Reyanna Maria signed a record deal with Victor Victor Worldwide. When she sings, “He ain’t never met a woman like me,” Maria tells the world she’s not like other girls because who else could get Tyga featured on their song with just one viral TikTok? 
Blu DeTiger — “Toast with the Butter”
Blue DeTiger grew to TikTok fame with her bass guitar right by her side. This month DeTiger released seven punk-filled tracks on her first EP “How Did We Get Here?” The groovy sound of her bass-guitar would make anyone get up and dance, making “Toast with the Butter” the perfect song to start the day off to. After all, who doesn’t want to have a dance party while you’re having “coffee in the mornin’ and toast with the butter?”
Aly & AJ — “Pretty Places”
It’s no secret that Aly & AJ’s “Potential Breakup Song” was a defining song of Gen-Z’s childhood. These sisters never stopped making good music and “Pretty Places” is a testament to that. This song will make you want to drive along Pacific Coast Highway with the windows down to “Watch the sunrise, sunset, [in the] same day/When was the last time you did that anyways?”
Giveon — “Heartbreak Anniversary”
On this “Heartbreak Anniversary” of normal life, R&B singer-songwriter Giveon’s song reminds us of the pain caused by losing someone you love. A soulful artist with the ability to capture any emotion into a song, Giveon gives us a beautiful song to cry to when we’re feeling sad. 
Trinity Gomez is a junior writing about TikTok and popular culture. Her column, “TikTalk,” runs every other Tuesday.

Language use and inclusive language is a critical aspect of creating safe spaces. With languages like English, opting for inclusive language is easier than others considering terms like friends, partner and folks exist to step in for gendered language like ladies and gentlemen and guys. 
These substitutes become more difficult for languages that are historically gendered in all aspects, like Spanish. For example, there is no gender non-binary word for friends in Spanish; it’s either amigos or amigas. And, when referring to groups of many genders, the maculine word (amigos) prevails. 
Throughout the history of Spanish language, specifically in Latin America and the United States, there have been pushes to replace gendered language with things like the @ sign, an e and an x. The debate over which of these terms should be used was trending within the last week on Twitter. However, there were a few things missing during this discourse: 1) understanding the history of these alternatives and 2) actual Latin voices in the debate that are in the U.S.and also in Latin America. 
The debate on Twitter lacked a lot of the historical context of inclusive languages pushed within the Spanish speaking community, most of which have to do with the alternative @, x and e. The @ sign was one of the first replacements in the word Latino/a as a way to have both the a and o represented; the problem is that this replacement didn’t catch on in verbal speech. 
Latinx also has been around for a long time — since 2004 — yet it did not gain traction until recently. This language substitute is seen mostly in the U.S.and among the LGBTQ+ community. The e replacement has also been in use for a long time in small communities and has gained more traction once the term Latinx has come into scrutiny. 
A Pew Research study showcases that the term Latinx is not widely used in the Latin community or within the U.S. and even less outside of it. Some even go as far as to say that the term Latinx is elitist, since only a small percentage of people use and understand it, which leaves out the majority of the community it is meant for. The word Latine, in contrast, has been argued to be easier to pronounce and to use with other words like amige instead of amigo/a. 
To understand this word debate and how these terms come into play, it is important to understand how these terms and pushes for replacements have existed for a long time and are only now becoming a part of popular culture. It is also important to understand how these replacements are really only prevalent in the U.S., like the use of Latinx, and can be seen as elitist in Latin countries. 
What was notably missing in this recent debate was the crucial voices of people who belong to this community. Although some Latin community members did speak up and tweet about this debate, scrolling through Twitter revealed many non-Latin voices leading the discourse. 
The decision of which terms to use cannot be decided by the non-Latin community members whose native language is not Spanish. In cases like this, the often shamed-upon notion of gatekeeping is okay. Even if these non-Latin groups speak and understand Spanish and are within close proximity of this community, it is the native Spanish community that needs to be making these decisions about their own language and navigating these conversations. Gatekeeping is often seen as a negative thing, but when it comes to conversations that are specific to one group, it is not difficult to see why having said groups lead and make decisions is detrimental to ensuring that this inclusive language is universally understood. This ensures that the decisions about language used to be inclusive is not elitist as the term Latinx is seen in Latin America and within Spanish speaking communities.

As the bridges, tunnels, highways and railways across the United States increasingly deteriorate, the country is in dire need of an infrastructure overhaul. Improvements to public transportation and increased access, especially in urban areas, must be included. This will help bolster the country’s public resources and, more critically, increase economic opportunities for low income individuals.
In order for people to have access to economic opportunities and the potential for upward socioeconomic mobility, it is critical for them to be able to get around. Low-income Americans who are unable to afford a car should not be punished for an inability to get around using their own means. Instead, they should be afforded the opportunity to move around by providing geographically extensive and affordable public transportation.
Geographic mobility is directly linked to economic mobility correlating to economic success. A study found that low access to public transit caused higher unemployment rates in New York City. Large cities such as New York City and Los Angeles must expand their public transportation infrastructure in order to increase economic opportunity and help close the wealth inequality seen across the country. 
Part of the accessibility problem is caused by cities focusing resources in the wrong places. 69% of all public bus riders have household income levels below $50,000. As bus transportation gets so little investment proportionally, other forms of public transit with lower ridership numbers and more affluent demographics such as light rail receive more of the funding. It is clear that federal, state and local governments are neglecting the mode of public transportation that is used by the people who need it the most.
Meanwhile, cities are investing heavily in alternative modes of public transportation such as bike shares. Bike shares are often placed in affluent neighborhoods, as they have become a ‘trendy’ way to travel. They also often require a credit card to use, which prevents poorer groups who may not have access to lines of credit from being able to use the bikes. A recent study in Washington, D.C. found that over 50% of users of their bike system had incomes of above $100,000.
Furthermore, accessibility is limited by cost. A USC survey found that between 30 to 40% of L.A. metro riders missed some sort of an activity in 2019 because of transportation costs. In order to increase accessibility to public transportation for low income groups, funds should be increased for the method used most: public bussing. 
This can be done through increasing budgets for regional public transit systems or by redirecting funds away from bikeshares and railways to busses. Higher funding will allow cities to provide more bus routes and increase subsidization of public busses so that it is more affordable for income groups that rely on public transit to get to work.
Urban areas including L.A. must improve their public transportation to better the country’s infrastructure and thus the economy. Local and state governments need to work to ensure public transportation systems are easily accessible and affordable for the people that need it most in their everyday lives. The federal government must ensure in their next infrastructure bill that they recognize the importance of public transportation systems to the nation’s largest metropolises and fund them accordingly.

Student creators had a unique opportunity to learn more about the current status of LGBTQ+ representation in the media and ask questions about ways to increase representation while writing stories in a safe space during a Zoom discussion Wednesday. The virtual event “Writing Queer Stories for Film and Television” was a collaborative effort between the SCA Council on Diversity & Inclusion and Queer Students in Cinematic Arts.
Moderator Beverly Neufeld created an inclusive, comfortable atmosphere although the event was attended by over 50 students. Panelists Steven J. Kung, Patricia Resnick, Moisés Zamora, Shadi Petosky and Hillard Guess shared their personal experiences as members of the LGBTQ+ community working in the industry. 
The first question posed to the panelists allowed them to share their queer experiences while working in entertainment. First to answer was writer, director and USC alumnus Steven J. Kung, who explained how writers’ rooms and showrunners can be discriminatory, although they are generally pictured as left-leaning. 
“I was in rooms that were supposedly liberal because writers’ rooms are supposedly bastions of progressivism,” Kung said. “I was one of two minorities in the room, and the showrunner had said, ‘Oh yeah, I was going to hire this Black woman, but I decided not to because she might object to certain jokes.’” 
Kung said he recalled times he felt unheard while proofreading a script. After noticing a cultural inaccuracy where a character from Spain was identified incorrectly as Latino, he suggested the misidentification should be changed. A higher-up agreed, yet the change was not made in the final product. 
“It’s good to listen to minorities in the room,” Kung said. 
Kung currently writes on the popular Netflix show “Dear White People.” Unlike his previous writers’ rooms, Kung said the show appreciates all input, noting the writers’ room is completely androphilic and comprised of majority Black and female writers. 
USC alumna Patricia Resnick, screenwriter and producer of projects including “9 to 5” and “A Wedding,” detailed her experience as either the only gay person or gay woman in many writers’ rooms.  
She proposed an interesting point about diversity in regard to age. Age is not always thought of when discussing diversity, so her personal experience with age-based discrimination brought this issue to the forefront for her. Shortly after becoming a mom in her early 40s, she realized she was no longer able to get jobs writing features. In other words, she aged out of her area of work. 
Although she was well established in the industry, Resnick said she needed to take TV movie jobs instead of feature film jobs to make ends meet. Resnick believes age is important to consider in the conversation about diversity within the industry since it is currently not discussed. 
Following Resnick, Moisés Zamora, the creator and co-showrunner for the Netflix show “Selena: The Series,” which follows the early life of cumbia singer Selena Quintanilla, spoke about how he felt compelled to create the safe space he didn’t have. After his experiences of discrimination and sexual harassment within the industry, he consciously created a writers’ room that is 70% queer-identifying and the majority of writers are women.
Next to answer was Shadi Petosky, an animator, writer and executive producer known for her work on “Danger & Eggs” and “Brightburn,” among other projects. She shared her struggles as a trans woman in the industry and the difficulties of being seen solely as an animator. At times she feels pigeonholed as an animator which prompted her to explore writing shows more.
Petosky created an animation studio in her 20s to get more freelance work before landing a job on the popular children’s television show, “Yo Gabba Gabba.” She revealed that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ran the show and, during the time Prop 8 — a California ballot measure in 2008 which looked to ban same-sex marriage — was on the ballot, they sent out a lengthy, homophobic correspondence regarding the proposition’s message to those working on the show, shocking many attendees. 
After this job, Petosky found success when Disney bought a show she wrote, which she said came as a surprise since Disney does not actively advocate for including trans voices. Her organization, Trans Hollywood, focuses on bringing the lack of trans representation to light and increasing trans representation in the industry.
After Petosky, actor Hilliard Guess encouraged attendees to embrace their LGBTQ+ identity in the industry because they can still tell part of their story through their work, even if the media does not have the specific space for them. 
During the event, Guess made a distinction regarding the changing definition of diversity. Although it is important to have LGBTQ+ diversity, Guess said he would not want to see a panel marketed as diverse with only white women, even if they came from diverse backgrounds.
After each panelist answered the question posed by the moderator, the floor was open to students to ask questions. One student, Phoebe Lai, asked how allies can support the production of queer stories without taking away opportunities from the community. 
Zamora said LGBTQ+ creators are seldom asked this question. He advised that it is important to find a co-writer when trying to tell a story about any group you are not a member of. 
“You know, with the social reckoning happening right now we need to do a lot of rebuilding and giving those people that voice and that opportunity is really, really important,” Zamora said.
Another student, Jingtong Wu, asked each panelist what they hoped queer representation would look like in the future. Although the panelists agreed more representation is necessary, Petosky and Resnick differed in how representation should materialize. 
Petosky said she wants to see flawed and messy characters to reflect the true nature of human beings. Resnick provided a different perspective, explaining how creators must be careful of what they make due to the current minimal representation and since many viewers only understand the LGBTQ+ community within what they see in the media. 
Taylor Stuckey asked a question about remaining authentic when telling a story which prompted Resnick to advise that students should write about what they are passionate about instead of what they think the market wants. In closing remarks, the panelists provided reminders to students as they continue creating. 
“Work on your craft. It sort of builds up, right? No writing is wasted,” Zamora stated.

From Justin Timberlake to Nick Jonas, young Disney stars have always found themselves under pop culture’s spotlight — especially if the media catches a whiff of any relationship drama.
This pressure is no secret to rising actor-songwriter Joshua Bassett, who stars in the hit Disney+ series, “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” Despite posting EP song snippets on social media over the past two years, he’s recently had his name thrown into the spotlight following the release of his co-star (and alleged ex) Olivia Rodrigo’s record-breaking single, “drivers license.” Amid breakup rumors and media scrutiny, Bassett finally shared his artistry with the world with the release of his self-titled debut EP last Friday.
Bassett kicks off his EP on a strong note with “Sorry.” Narrating a story of a failing relationship, he opens with dramatic, impressive piano riffs, jazzy vocals and pop drums to create a unique sonic aesthetic: think noir, spy movie soundtrack meets boy band bops. As the instrumentals continue to build with more complex elements, the second half of the song loses a bit of its chills-down-your-spine magic. There’s a moment in the second verse where Bassett’s vocals distort in an EDM-esque fashion, which builds on the drama but doesn’t seem to match the track. The song was enjoyable but ended up sounding like a somewhat generic boy band song. Nonetheless, it introduces Bassett as a bold young musician and stylistically speaks to the teen heartthrob he’s become.
His second track, “Do It All Again,” dramatically slows the tempo down. Wistfully recalling a failed love, the song reads as though he’s massaging a sore wound: admitting to “the mess [he] made,” but still remaining grateful for the relationship. Acoustic, emotional and reminiscent of his first single, “Common Sense,” “Do It All Again” makes you feel like you’re walking through a field next to the ocean — reflective, nostalgic but appreciative. It’s a lovely, unique track that’s right in Bassett’s wheelhouse.
The third track and EP debut single, “Lie Lie Lie,” is pure acoustic pop. Produced with guitar-strumming elements and layered with harmonies, Bassett showcases his impressive upper vocal  range and control. It’s also clear that the song draws inspiration from successful male songwriters — the song itself sounds like it could fit into a circa-2014 Ed Sheeran single or older Maroon 5 album, and the vocal technique is emulative of artists like Shawn Mendes. But don’t be fooled, despite sounding like a lighthearted, boot-stomping tune, “Lie Lie Lie” is full of teenage angst. With lyrics such as “kiss your ass goodbye,” Bassett seemingly declares resentment about someone who’s been “lying to yourself / Lie to everyone else / Only thinking about yourself.” Decently produced, fairly catchy and lyrically repetitive, this song is a little underwhelming. 
Following this angsty anthem is “Only A Matter of Time,” a song that seems to address a similar situation, but with a completely different composition. In a waltz-y piano ballad, Bassett’s falsetto soars what could only be described as European-style guitar plucking and church bells to ultimately create an ominous and alluring tune. His musicality also really comes through in this track. With more sophisticated lyrics describing the pain of betrayal like “twisted your words like a knife” and “Pick myself up off the floor, you can’t hurt me / No more of this endless charade,” this dramatic, emotional style felt more heartfelt, individual and thoughtful on Bassett — something that was missing in the poppy repetition of “Lie Lie Lie.”
Previously taken by the Sabrina Carpenter duet “We Both Know,” track No. 5 is now occupied by “Telling Myself,” a catchy, head-bopping pop tune about a relationship that was doomed from the start. Telling the story now from the perspective of the heartbreaker, the song clearly draws inspiration from other pop artists. The verse’s melody is undeniably similar to Miley Cyrus’ “Prisoner,” and the song’s style itself sounds very similar to Shawn Mendes’ previous work. While an easy, enjoyable listen, it’s not particularly original.
Bassett concludes his EP with romantic piano ballad, “Heaven Is You.” There’s no better term to describe this song than teenage puppy love. Full of tender optimism and adoration for the “angel” that “fell in [his] lap,” this song’s head-over-heels attitude, hymnic R&B harmonies and borderline-campy lyrics are easily reminiscent of 1980s love ballads. It showcases Bassett’s romantic and raw side — you can tell he wrote this on the piano alone. Lyrically, it’s not doing anything new (many songs compare love to divine experiences), but it does have beautiful, unique chord progressions that seem to be a strength of Bassett’s. Bottom line, it’s a very sweet song to conclude with. 
While all of Bassett’s tracks have extremely different styles, the EP holds together with consistently strong vocals and creative musicality. What comes to Bassett’s strength is his ability to create instrumentally complex tracks. He’s clearly a very talented musician who’s quite skilled in not only innovating the classic four-chord songwriter structure but also building unique sonic aesthetics.
However, he shows gaps in his lyricism. With exceptions to songs like “Sorry” and “Only A Matter of Time,” many of Bassett’s lyrics are predictable and full of repetition. While there’s absolutely no doubt that he’s an incredibly talented musician, lyrical creativity and honesty is more important than ever in modern music — just look at the success of songwriters like Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Harry Styles. To thrive in the current music climate, this EP could’ve benefitted by exercising more lyrical creativity instead of scrambling to find a rhyme.
Nonetheless, it’s undeniable that this Disney star has a long career ahead of himself, so this untapped potential may work to his strength in future projects.
Rating: 3.5 / 5 stars
