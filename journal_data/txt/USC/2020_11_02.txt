After Ariana Grande’s unannounced tweet earlier this month hinted at the release of her sixth studio album, fans have been spiraling in anticipation of the singer-songwriter’s 14-track album, “Positions,” ever since. Finally released Friday, “Positions” reveals a transformative state for Grande as she abandons her usual girly pop and enters the world of maturity and R&B. 
A week prior, the 27-year-old singer dropped the album’s lead single, “positions.” Driven by a simple melody and pizzicato of string instruments, the tune is a catchy mix of pop and R&B. The lyrics Grande sings, “’Cause I’ll be switchin’ them positions for you” and “Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do,” seem like a surface-level love tribute to Grande’s current boyfriend, Dalton Gomez, as she sings about how she will take any measures to make the relationship work. Yet, the true meaning behind these lyrics transcend a typical love song.
In implying the switching of “positions” between men and women, the song “positions” suddenly becomes an anthem about women being capable of attaining power, success and a healthy relationship.
Empowerment is a common theme throughout “Positions.” Grande addresses her critics and haters in the album’s opening track, “shut up,” asking them “How you be using your tongue (How?)” when they “be so worried ‘bout mine (Mine)” and suggesting that they “sound so dumb.” Though the message is hardcore, the vibe is anything but. The chorus sounds like a heavenly choir with layers of harmonies and delicate strums of string instruments.
“shut up” and its slow, mellow vibe rings similar to most songs on “Positions.” Light orchestral instrumentation is used throughout a surplus of tracks, from the first song to the last, “pov,” though the deeper meaning between the two differs heavily. 
In “pov,” Grande expresses her desire to see herself, flaws and all, through her significant other’s point of view to understand why they love her the way they do. Grande asserts “I wanna love me (Ooh) / The way that you love me (Ooh) / For all of my pretty and all of my ugly too,” exposing her insecurities and wishes.
Singer, songwriter and record producer Ty Dolla $ign collaborated with Grande for the first time in her song “safety net.” The lyrics further reveal a vulnerable side to Grande as she opened up about her current state of mind. 
Singing “I’ve never been this scared before / Feelings I just can’t ignore / Don’t know if I should fight or fly / But I don’t mind,” Grande opens up about her fear of falling in love again after a public and tumultuous past couple of years with the death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller and the called-off engagement with Pete Davidson. Ultimately, she embraces the risk, singing “Don’t know if I should fight or fly / But I don’t mind” and loves it, as evident by the rest of the album.
The album then picks up with its more upbeat tracks, “six thirty” and “nasty.” Grande sings in an airy tone, sending listeners to an ethereal trance, and the hip-hop beats in the background make for a bop. In both songs, Grande also becomes more outright explicit about her love for Gomez. She even literalizes the mathematical addition of “34+35” at the end of the song for anyone who missed the hint. The groovy, disco-style “love language” is an immediate favorite, becoming another success for Grande in her experimentations of different music styles.
Grande collaborated with artists Doja Cat on “motive” and The Weeknd on “off the table.” 
“motive,” a flirty and playful interrogation of what someone’s motives are when they’re into you, sounds like an addictive dance jam that would appear in an iPhone commercial; Doja Cat and her fiery rap-verse is a breath of fresh air. 
“off the table” is slow, groovy and sensual with lush bass and guitar riffs accompanying the duo’s buttery vocals. The Weeknd’s lyrics, “I can love you harder than I did before,” make a clever reference to their 2014 collaboration, “Love Me Harder.” 
Many of the songs in “Positions” reference or bear similarities to Grande’s past works, bringing long-time fans to a moment of nostalgia. The beginning of “nasty” where the music speeds up and winds forward is reminiscent of the beginning of “The Way (feat. Mac Miller),” one of Grande’s hits from her first studio album, “Yours Truly,” that launched her further into stardom. “nasty” and “my hair” also bring back the whistle tones prevalent in Grande’s old works but missing in her recent ones.
The flirty nature of “my hair” fuses well with the song’s sultry R&B beats. The lyrics, “Usually don’t let people touch it / But tonight, you get a pass” playfully equate Grande’s iconic high ponytail as a wall that she only lets down for a few special people. Grande sings the entire last chorus in her whistle register, demonstrating immense control over her voice.
With the exception of “shut up,” “safety net” and “pov,” each song focuses on or hints to Grande’s physical relationship with Gomez. “Positions” perfectly describes her passionate quarantine with Gomez while writing this album, but it lacks the deep dive into her emotional state, in contrast to Grande’s last two albums, “Sweetener” and “thank u, next,” which were written after a damaging turn of events: the 2017 Manchester bombing and her history with Miller and Davidson.
The album as a whole feels like an unusual combination of sentiments ranging from regret and vulnerability to empowerment and outright raunchiness, lacking a sense of cohesiveness. Yet, in all its rawness and sultriness, “Positions” serves as a testament to Grande’s true vocal abilities with her delicate flutters, smooth runs and extreme control over her voice as she flips between registers. In paying homage to and recycling small parts from past works, “Positions” gives an insight into Grande’s inspirations and emotions as she transitions into a new experimental era of R&B.

There’s something strangely thrilling about lying in bed watching Chinese streetwear fashion TikToks, but lately, that seems to be all I’ve been doing. I’ve scrolled through countless compilations of Chinese influencers, serving looks with brand-name outfits and other luxury pieces fit for the runway, walking on the street in Beijing or Shanghai and looking into the camera with their signature “model” expressions.  
I’m not ashamed to say that I’ve tried recreating similar outfits at home and attempted to walk the same way as the influencers do in their staged videos. While these attempts have been mostly failures, they’ve also taught me that it’s less about the talk and more about the walk. Put simply, it’s not just about the outfits, but the “coolness” you feel when you’re in them. 
As a Chinese American, I love Chinese streetwear fashion. I don’t think I’ve ever found as much joy as I have in watching all these Chinese influencers strut their style in everyday settings. Watching these videos taught me that I didn’t actually understand contemporary fashion in mainland China, which is fresh and new and, yes, primarily defined by the context of China’s consumer culture but has evolved to become its own style. It’s especially refreshing to see Chinese streetwear fashion incorporating traditional Chinese clothing, such as reinterpretations of “hanfu” and other forms of reinventing outfits historically significant in Chinese culture.  
Despite the fact that my attempts at imitating these styles and outfits were lacking, the mere process of trying to imitate them made me so much more conscious of not only my Chinese identity but also the concept of Chinese “coolness,” a discourse that’s largely absent in dominant representations of Chinese streetwear and students in the United States. 
Dominant rhetoric surrounding Chinese streetwear fashion in the United States is usually negative, blatantly xenophobic or used to deride Chinese international students for what they wear — in these cases, both negative and xenophobic. My consumption of Chinese streetwear fashion made me more conscious of its presence in the United States, or rather, how it’s negatively perceived in the United States concerning Chinese international students. 
Reddit posts will stereotype Chinese international students using fashion, writing comments about how Chinese international students use their wealth to act superior by wearing luxury brands or “flex” on others’ clothing choices. 
“International student starter pack” memes may have humorous connotations, but there’s also a darker element of “othering” Chinese students and clearly labeling Chinese students as “foreign” based on what they wear. The idea that Chinese international students’ streetwear fashion is just to glorify brand names is a simplistic and harmful assumption to make. 
For the most part, the Chinese international students I’ve had the opportunity to meet don’t use streetwear fashion to flaunt their wealth to U.S. students intentionally. This isn’t to say that this is all-encompassing, of course. Yet to put it broadly, Chinese streetwear fashion is fundamentally based in a very complex class-oriented landscape of contemporary China, where it’s an unspoken but necessary social script to affirm social status with an external means of doing so, such as style and clothing. 
Chinese streetwear fashion is incredibly cool, and more people need to recognize its coolness in ways that don’t depend on a one-dimensional understanding of contemporary Chinese fashion. 
It’s paradoxical that Chinese students’ streetwear fashion, which is more so associated with “fitting in” in the culture of mainland China, is used to decry a perceived failure to do so in the United States. My greatest wish is to reconcile our understanding of Chinese streetwear fashion as synonymous with coolness instead of using it to feed a dominant narrative of “othering” Chinese students on campus. 
Acknowledging Chinese streetwear in China as a source of coolness can expand our transnational understanding of the complexity of Chinese street culture and Chinese culture as a whole. By redefining Chinese streetwear fashion as not a symptom of difference but of coolness, we can learn how to appreciate the essence of Chinese streetwear, which is about what you’re wearing and how you wear it. 
It’s necessary to acknowledge that appreciating Chinese streetwear fashion is not a one-way conduit to respecting Chinese students in the United States. To say so would be a reductionist argument, devoid of a true understanding of how xenophobia works. Yet I think there’s something to be said about how fashion is used to delineate the differences between Chinese international students at USC and U.S. students. Chinese streetwear and style being used as a clear marker of “foreignness” and to justify exclusionary rhetoric appears to reflect a deeper flaw in how we understand fashion and, on a larger scale, those who consume it. 
On a fundamental level, Chinese streetwear fashion is really intended to be a way of radiating confidence. Yet, to me, it’s not even really about the clothes. It’s about the way you feel when you’re in them. It’s about walking the walk. It’s about the attitude, feeling pride in your culture and the way you wear it. It’s about feeling cool, but more importantly, feeling Chinese.

It feels as if a wave of civic engagement has swept across the country. Election day is still a day away and more than 90 million Americans have already voted. Those voters represent almost 43% of registered voters nationwide and a pair of states — Hawaii and Texas — have already exceeded their total vote counts from 2016. 
Californians appear to have been bitten by the same voting bug. Approximately 40% of California’s electorate has already voted, and experts say that the state is on track to shatter its previous total voting record. For fans of democracy, which I hope includes every American, this is incredible! However, the levels of turnout seen in California also beg the question: In what is one of the most reliably blue states in the union, how much does one’s vote actually matter?
The answer is plain and simple. In California, your vote matters a lot. In fact, it could be argued — and it will be argued by yours truly — that a vote in California has the potential to impact more Americans and engender more change than a vote in any other state. However, before we delve into my raving, California-nationalist take on the power of a Golden State ballot, the elephant in the room must be discussed: presidential elections. 
When people say that their vote for president doesn’t really matter in California, they’re not entirely wrong. If you’re voting for the Democratic presidential candidate, you’re just piling onto what is already California’s sizable, perennial blue majority. On the other hand, if your political inclinations lean right, voting for the Republican presidential candidate amounts to a masochist exercise in political self-flagellation. 
Facts and data bare out the same story. The New York Times’ columnist Farhad Manjoo recently noted in his own column that in 2016, a combined 80,000 vote margin in favor of Donald Trump in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania superseded the more than 4 million vote margin Hillary Clinton received in California. Clearly, these figures illustrate a fundamentally undemocratic feature of our electoral system, but the ramifications are not only felt there. 
According to the same column, fracking was mentioned 10 times during the 2020 Vice Presidential Debate. That makes sense, considering how important the issue is toward securing that aforementioned, sacred midwestern majority, but what about California? What about the largest state in the country, where wildfires have wreaked havoc on hundreds of thousands of Americans for months now? What about housing and homelessness, the two issues that many in the state consider to be of the highest importance? 
Well, when it comes to those questions, the answers were virtually nonexistent. Wildfires only received a glancing mention, and it was by the debate’s moderator, Susan Page. Neither housing nor homelessness were even mentioned. This all becomes even more infuriating in light of the fact that Kamala Harris is California’s god-damn Senator and not even she felt compelled to address the crises facing her state in light of the marginal incentives for doing so. 
This is a big, big problem. It strikes at the core of our representative democracy. No voter, regardless of their state, should feel like their vote is an afterthought and no vote should be an afterthought. This is not to invalidate the real and pressing issues facing Americans in other parts of the country. What happens to the people of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania is no less important than what happens to the people of California, but they should be no more important either. But the value placed on a certain segment of voters in this country has become so disproportionate that the concerns of a select few states have become the altar upon which our political parties place nearly their entire collective fortunes on, and this is deeply troubling. 
Voters in California should be mad about this. It is wrong. It challenges the notion that we are a functioning democracy. However, Californians must not let the failings of our federal election system distract them from the power their vote truly holds. 
In California, voters will decide the fate of affirmative action programs within the most comprehensive and advanced postsecondary educational system in the world: the University of California system. They will decide whether or not to restore parolees’ rights to vote and whether or not to extend the franchise to allow 17 year olds to vote in primary elections. They will decide whether or not 2018’s blue wave will be sustained in pivotal swing districts across the state and whether or not the country’s largest prosecutorial office and the world’s largest prison system will be subject to changes by a new progressive prosecutor. The future of the gig economy, and the tens of millions of people it employs, is on the ballot as well. 
By no means should Californians discount the Presidential election. It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of our country and our world  will be determined by it. However, as Californians head to voting centers at record pace to cast their ballots this year, they must remember that not only does the soul of our nation hang in the balance, but so does the fate of California and the 39.5 million Americans that call it home, as well.

Lead singer of alternative-rock band Young the Giant, Sameer Gadhia sat down with USC’s Dean of Religious and Spiritual Life Varun Soni Wednesday and discussed the need for diversity in the music industry, coping with addiction and the adverse impacts of social media.
The event was the fifth installment of USC Amplified’s conversational series “Thrive.” USC Visions and Voices hosted the event and brought together renowned leaders and artists to share their ideas on how we can spiritually, emotionally and mentally cope with the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Soni begins every event by paying respects to the Tongva tribe, acknowledging that USC was built on the tribe’s ancestral land. 
Singer of hit songs such as “Mind Over Matter” and alternative-rock chart-topper “Superposition,” Gadhia is considered a pioneer for South Asian representation in contemporary rock. Gadhia discussed being one of few Indian American musicians in the industry and why it’s imperative that he embraces his culture. 
“I don’t think I realized the importance of being ‘other’ and the power of that,” Gadhia said.
He noted that while there is a beauty and purpose in keeping music abstract and “faceless” — not associating an identity to the creator but merely revelling in the creation — it is necessary that artists begin sharing their culture and showcasing their identity to their listeners to further the representation of diverse backgrounds in music. 
“If you don’t provide context, you can’t set forth a path for the next generation of artists to be able to have their stories be normalized,” Gadhia said. 
With this exact goal in mind, Gadhia spoke about his show, “Point of Origin,” a curation that features a new, diverse artist twice a month. The show, which can be found on SiriusXM’s Alt Nation, Pandora and Spotify, strives to redefine alternative music by creating an inclusive platform for people to discover distinct content.
“There wasn’t that other community of artists of color, who don’t necessarily fit in, to share their stories and share their celebrations, trials and tribulations and so ‘Point of Origin’ really stemmed from that” Gadhia said.
Gadhia also discussed exploring his own identity and his desire to uplift others who faced the same internal struggles with identity in a divisive political climate that has fueled the disenfranchisement of minorities. 
Soni steered the conversation toward the topic of drug use, highlighting the rough image that often is associated with the music industry and substance use. 
Pointing out the spike in substance abuse during the pandemic, Soni urged Gadhia to provide his insight on the matter and advise students on how they can seek those highs in the safest ways. 
Gadhia was incredibly candid about his addiction to alcohol and connected it to his need to feel the same “out of body experience” he gets from being immersed in his music. He spoke about how the rock community glorifies the “sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll” image without discussing its drawbacks. 
“There’s this idea of trying to look cool at all times,” Gadhia said. “And I think in a lot of ways, that’s what everyone deals with now because everyone’s online, everyone sees the best foot of all of their friends. They think everyone’s doing the coolest things all the time.”  
He believes people feel an unrealistic need for perfection and that pressure fueled by the toxic culture of social media is responsible for the need to resort to that lifestyle. Gadhia also encouraged students to have active and open conversations about addiction and to seek help if they’re struggling.
Gadhia also revealed his distaste for the world of social media. While understanding that social media has enabled a lot of people to earn a living and given them a platform to share their work, he believes that it simultaneously can be harmful.
“Social media presence of always being viral, always being relevant has destroyed the art form, in a lot of ways, of most traditional art forms,” Gadhia said.  
It’s truly inspiring listening to Gadhia speak about his love for music. He comes from a place of passion and dedication. 
“It’s just a freeing experience,” Gadhia said. “It’s actually the one time in my life I feel I’m one of the truest versions of myself. I’m living in the present. And it’s the closest thing to spirituality that I can experience in my life.” 
As an Indian American, Gadhia was on what’s thought to be “the ideal path” of becoming a doctor as a Stanford pre-med student, but he sacrificed the appeal of a stable life to follow his dream of pursuing music. 
From the pressure of family and convention to the trials of uncertainty, the road to success was not an easy one. Watching his journey play out is motivating for many students, especially during this uncertain time. 
“For all those future USC students who are graduating, just know that no one is going to do anything for you,” Gadhia said. “If you work hard, if you cultivate luck — which I truly believe in — just being available and open to the world, to be able to have that luck at your hands at any given moment, then it can happen.” 
He said he has learned to “embrace the uncertainty of the abyss” and the importance of family during the pandemic by making time for loved ones and working to become a better human being. 
The event ended with Gadhia’s performing an exclusive snippet of Young the Giant’s unreleased song, “Metropolis” — a song about the power of belief. 
There’s a line from the song that all of us can resonate with: “I feel guilt for the things I can’t change.” The line is symbolic of the immense amount of pressure we’ve put on ourselves this last year in trying to be more and do more in a situation that has never been in our control. To surrender instead, to learn to love the little joys that surprise us and to seize the teachings we’ve received in these times is probably the only way we can get through this time in a manner that is most empathetic to ourselves.
