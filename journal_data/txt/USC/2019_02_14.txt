This article was originally published in the Dec. 10, 1985 issue of the Daily Trojan. Pussycat Theaters was a prominent chain of adult movie theaters with 30 locations in California in the 1980s. 
“Obscene” means different things to different people, but the president of Pussycat Theaters, Jimmie Johnson, has a definition all his own.
“Obscene? Oh, wow,” Johnson said. “Obscene films are boring films; films that are on the screen too long. Also films that rip the public off by promising (titillation) and then not delivering.”
Johnson has spent a large part of his 17-year association with California’s premier adult theater organization persuading the courts, the police and the public that his chain is not obscene — by anyone’s definition. [He started as a] truck driver and worked his way up to become president five years ago. Though he’s been arrested and involved in numerous obscenity trials, he’s always been acquitted.
In the 1970s he was an easy target for quota-seeking policemen, he said, because he often had to travel far to get prints, and police, he continued, usually illegally, were often hot on his tail.
Before a film can be confiscated on the grounds of obscenity, a policeman must enter the theater, view the film in its entirety, and report to a judge for a warrant. Then he must come back to the theater with the warrant and confiscate the film.
Too often, Johnson said, these procedures are ignored. He referred to an incident in Buena Park in the early 1970s, in which he said a judge was standing on a sidewalk issuing blank warrants. Johnson said he received a warrant for simply picking up a film for a theater, even though the judge had obviously not seen the film.
Police officials in Buena Park would not discuss the incident with the Daily Trojan.
Despite the dogged monitoring of the FBI, religious groups and policemen, the Pussycat Theaters remain 34 screens strong and eager to celebrate their 25th anniversary.
The first Pussycat Theater opened in Huntington Park in 1961. For its first few months of operation, the theater showed general-release features. But Johnson said it quickly became a babysitter for hyperactive children.
“The theater was practically ripped apart,” Johnson said. “Constant repairs were needed — kids would fight the manager and each other.
But Johnson also admitted that the theater couldn’t make money showing general releases. “Mainstream movies are very competitive. If you don’t have a lot of theaters, you can’t get first-run product.”
Pussycat’s ’60s product reveals less skin than its ’80s offerings, but the controversy surrounding its showing was just as strong.
“Guys always kept their clothes on in the movies back then,” Johnson said. “The girls would be seen only with bare breasts — everything else was covered. Gradually, more and more was revealed until the ‘how-to’ documentaries of the ’70s, when the whole industry went hardcore.”
And that marked the start of the Pussycat success story — a story largely restricted to those over 18. It also marked the start of a growing public furor over Pussycat’s films, a furor Johnson must fight every day.
As the chain’s primary booking agent, Johnson selects films for each of the 34 theaters. He views them all in a plush screening room next to his office, and employs rigid criteria in determining which features are worthy.
“I like my movies to move,” Johnson said. “Have you ever gone to a movie and started squirming in your seat after 15 minutes? That’s because you’re bored. The same things that make an adult film exciting make a mainstream film exciting — good plot, good name entertainment and good technical qualities.”
Unwilling to discount “adult qualities” entirely, Johnson added, “and good, exciting sex.”
Johnson said the only sex his films will not show are child pornography and bestiality. “I really haven’t seen much of that anyway. I think it’s mostly popular in Europe.”
And though there have been allegations that the industry trafficks in “snuff” films (where women are supposedly murdered on camera), Johnson insists that none have been made.
But his insistence hasn’t convinced his opponents. “When people hear ‘adult theater’ they think of a snuff/kid-porn double feature. With a lot of these people, there’s nothing I can do to change their minds. They will never come to my theaters, so I can’t show them otherwise.”
If they would come to his theaters, Johnson said, what they’d find would surprise them. “First and foremost, we are a group of theaters. We’re not a series of auditoriums with 39 folding chairs. All our staff is in uniform. Our bathrooms are clean. We have a rule book four inches thick.”
His rule book may guarantee quality, but it can’t ensure profits. For some of his theaters, Johnson said 1985 has been a “learning year.” He said some of his locations are losing money for the first time since their opening.
“Adult theaters have to compete now. Everyone is making and showing movies these days — cable companies, commercial jetliners, luxury hotels and of course, the video market,” Johnson said. 
With the proliferation of adult video tapes, potential Pussycat patrons can watch the same or similar films at home. But that’s not Johnson’s only grievance.
“Producers went too far by bringing adult features into the homes. A lot of fundamentalist groups don’t like it, and they have loud voices. That makes their fight against theaters even stronger,” he added.
As if financial competition weren’t enough of a problem, Johnson also faces strict zoning ordinances. “Some of those laws are ridiculous,” he said. The ordinances restrict his theaters’ locations. They may not be near another adult theater, a school, a church, a park, and what Johnson calls the most frustrating — any place where a minor is “likely to congregate.”
“Who knows where a minor is going to congregate? It’s impossible to predict,” he said. “The law requires the city to find us a place to operate, but you should see some of the places they come up with. One was in the middle of a Lockheed hangar.”
But Johnson is generally pleased with the cooperation he’s received from Los Angeles, where 18 of his theaters are located. A large autographed portrait of Tom Bradley hangs in his office.
“The big people downtown know what we do and how we do it. They know we’re a quality operation. Yes, we’ve contributed money to political campaigns, but we never do it as ‘Pussycat Theaters.’ Anyway, nobody downtown would be embarrassed to accept money from Pussycat Theaters,” Johnson said.
He said most of his problems come from other cities, which he didn’t identify.
Johnson is throwing “one hell of a party” to commemorate Pussycat’s 25th birthday. He plans in-house promotions and prize give-aways to push Pussycat into the public eye. Most of all, he wants to recapture the spirit of the early 1970s, which was rich with profit and enthusiasm. 
Those were the days of Deep Throat.
“You know, when I first saw that film, before it came out, I had no idea it would be the smash that it was. I played it for 10 years,” Johnson said. Daily Variety reports Deep Throat to be Los Angeles’ undisputed box-office attraction for 1972 and 1973.
“I beat all the competition. I had that film in one theater and it beat stuff like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Lady Sings the Blues. Those were playing everywhere. Every day I had a 596-seat house filled for 13 shows. People waited in the rain for four hours to see Deep Throat.”
Johnson couldn’t pinpoint precisely what made Deep Throat so special, but said it is still quite “adult,” even by today’s standards.
Although his films are geared toward adults, young people benefit from their profits. After some questioning, Johnson admitted that he has done a lot of charity work over the years, especially with the Variety Club. “We don’t publicize things like that,” he said, “because that’s not the reason we do it.”
One may question the morality of the “entertainment” Johnson provides, but there is no questioning the cleanliness of his theaters and the friendliness of his staff.
A visitor to the Pussycat at 1508 North Western Avenue found the theater and bathroom immaculate, and the employees congenial. The theater is quite large, reasonably well-lit (once your eyes adjust), the seats are comfortable, and uniformed ushers are always on patrol.
As for Burning Snow, the film being screened at the time, well … that’s better discussed in an editorial.

Some of us are lucky enough to have found love. The Daily Trojan featured three couples around campus: underclassmen, upperclassmen and faculty. Their background are different, their personalities varied. But they all have one similarity: love for their significant other.
Mona Cravens, Director of Student Publications: 
I appreciate Terry’s honesty. He’s always struck me as being honest when stating his opinions. I love his sense of humor. He’s a pretty funny guy.
Terry Cravens, USC Thornton Professor:
Mona laughs at my jokes. She’s a pretty great companion.
Caitlin Fitzpatrick, senior, cinema and media studies major:
I forget when I go back home [that being queer] is not a thing people are chill with everywhere. I forget that it’s weird here, and I love that I forget that. 
Taylor Whittemore, senior, cinema and media studies major:
Being on a campus in Southern California gives you a lot more freedom as an LGBT couple … It’s very much like, ‘no, it’s totally cool here.’ We both came from red states. That was a big impact too. 
Tommy Nguyen, freshman, history and psychology major: 
Briana’s a very kind person. I’m a little hot-headed sometimes, but Briana is good to people. She’s born with this amazing gift of seeing the good in everyone, which I feel like this world needs more of, and I’m lucky to have that. 
Briana Pelayo, freshman, psychology and sociology major:
He’s more extroverted, and I’m more reserved. He usually brings that energy out in me, so I don’t have to do it for myself.

The Daily Trojan set up a blind date between two USC students to explore the ways that love can find its start. The two participants were told to meet at the Starbucks in the USC Village at a given time and day, but were given no further instructions other than to write about how the date unfolded for this issue. What follows is an account of the date from each person’s perspective. The participants’ identities are kept anonymous. Read the other perspective here.
A few weeks ago, a friend who used to work at the Daily Trojan sent me a posting for this blind date feature and encouraged me to sign up. Without giving it much thought, I figured it couldn’t hurt to send an email expressing my interest. I was half expecting to receive a reply saying that a lot of people had applied already and that the spots had been filled, but at least I could say I tried. 
Several days later, I was sent a questionnaire asking for a basic profile of myself which I submitted it, again not expecting it to amount to anything. Then, on the Friday prior to the date, I was asked to meet with the Daily Trojan editors in person, and that’s when I realized this was actually going to happen. The meeting was a quick briefing with details on where and when I was supposed to meet my date. I remember just sitting there, wondering if it was too late for me to back out. The thought of meeting up with a complete stranger for a blind date with zero information about them was very intimidating, but at the same time I knew that I had to do it because it was so out of my comfort zone.
The only information I was given beforehand was to meet her at USC Village Starbucks at noon. I had no idea what her name was, what she looked like or even how I was expected to dress. There were obviously other concerns as well, such as the fear that we wouldn’t find any common ground and that the date would be an awkward disaster. But after running through all the possible worst-case scenarios in my head, I figured it would, at the very least, be a valuable learning experience.
On the day of, I showed up at the Starbucks a few minutes before noon and realized that I had no way of identifying who I was supposed to meet. I texted my Daily Trojan contact asking who I should be looking for and received a helpful answer of, “She should be there by 12! If you’re having trouble finding her lmk.” I decided to just sit by one of the tables outside the entrance and hope my date pick up on my clueless expression and figure out who I was. I guess it worked because several minutes later, I saw her round the corner and we made eye contact. 
“Um … Daily Trojan?” she asked. “Yep,” I responded, and we proceeded to introduce ourselves as we entered the Starbucks. After about 10 seconds in line, I asked if she had had eaten yet, and she said she had just woken up and was hungry, so we decided to get brunch at BBCM next door. 
We started talking about our experiences growing up. We came from pretty different backgrounds, me having grown up abroad in China and she in a small town in New Jersey. The conversation was engaging and transitioned smoothly from topic to topic — we covered everything from personal interests and the places we’d traveled to our aspirations for the future. Before I knew it, two hours had already passed. I had promised to be at my friend’s Super Bowl party that afternoon and she had work to do, so we decided it was time for the date to end. We hugged and parted ways, and that was that.
If you had told me a few years ago that I would be going on a blind date with someone, I would have been doubtful and skeptical. Even looking back now, I’m a bit surprised that I actually went through with the whole process. However, I definitely enjoyed the experience. 
Before the date, I spent a lot of time worrying about what could go wrong, but in reality, it was a great time to just meet a new person and get to know them over a meal. My biggest takeaway from this experience is that I should step out of my comfort zone more often because even though it can be daunting, the rewards are much greater than the risks.

The Daily Trojan set up a blind date between two USC students to explore the ways that love can find its start.

Somewhere, somehow, at some point during my adolescence, it was impressed upon me that I was going to experience love in college — walking around campus hand-in-hand while crisp autumn leaves fell down from the trees, having picnics on the grassy student quad, reading together on Sunday mornings. Three semesters, a blur of hookups and endless Tinder swipes later, I became resigned that my notion of the perfect collegiate love story was just like the many ideals I held about college life — naive and unrealistic. Yet, when I saw the Daily Trojan advertise a blind date on its Instagram story, a combination of boundless optimism and curiosity overtook me and I found myself filling out a Google form signing up to go on said blind date. Why not? 
Time passed by all too quickly, and suddenly it was noon on a Sunday and I was scanning the doorway of the Starbucks underneath my dorm hoping that the sweaty guy in basketball shorts with his headphones in at a table outside wasn’t my mysterious date. I breathed a sigh of relief when I noticed a cute guy nervously scanning the surrounding entrance. “Daily Trojan?” I quipped. Indeed, he was my date. 
We ended up going to BBCM instead of Starbucks to grab lunch, and between a dish of  eggs benedict that started out nervous but became more comfortable, I learned more about him: graduating senior, psychology major, game design minor, ex-volleyball player, health-conscious gym-goer, fellow Chinese American. His open demeanor helped me loosen up more throughout our meal and I felt my initial anxiety fading away. The conversation flowed fairly naturally and we ended up taking a walk through Target following our meal and then checking into my building to continue our conversation. 
The stream of words came to a halt as 2:30 p.m. rolled around. I had an essay to write and he had a Super Bowl party to attend. I checked him out of my building and that was that. My first-ever blind date was over. I hadn’t asked him for any contact information but most importantly, he hadn’t ask for mine either!
Did I talk too fast? Was I acting weird? Did my foundation flake? Should I not have mentioned that I smoked weed? Should I have signed him into my room instead of to a lounge? Was he trying to leave the whole time? I didn’t feel a spark — or honestly expect one — but I also didn’t expect a bruised ego. 
It was here, amid my immediate self-doubt following the date, that I realized I was approaching this whole dating thing wrong. There was no reason to feel doubt, or be perturbed by a guy not asking me for contact information. Despite self-identifying as hopeless romantic, I had grown all too accustomed to the college hookup lifestyle of just keeping someone around for security, self-esteem and sex. At some point during my college career, it was impressed upon me that dates were supposed to end in guys asking me for sex and me wielding the power to either reject or deny them. For me, dates had become a type of meeting to gauge interest in my body and, consequently, my value. They aren’t supposed to be. And this one wasn’t but in my head, I had built it into one.
Ultimately, here’s what I was reminded of thanks to my lovely blind date partner: Dates are supposed to be for exploring. Exploring the potential of a relationship, exploring awkwardness, exploring the psyche of a whole new person and, most importantly, exploring what you want in a partner. Seems obvious, right? 
I didn’t realize I had forgotten these commonly held notions until I was in the lobby of my dorm, processing the gentle blow of my date’s failure to ask for my contact information. I didn’t even want his contact information. I just wanted validation. And that’s not for dates are for (or should be for). 
Next time I go on a date, I’ll hope to find out more about them than graduating senior, psychology major, game design minor, ex-volleyball player, health-conscious gym-goer and fellow Chinese American. Daily Trojan reader, I hope you will do the same.

Gabrielle Robinson, a junior majoring in fine arts, was contacted by Tinder to create a sponsored Instagram post promoting the dating app’s brand. But when asked if she used the app herself, she said she only does so as a joke. 
“You don’t really need to post about your experience unless you want to, which is a little disingenuous,” Robinson said. “But I don’t really think it’s that important to do that, which I guess is a part of the problem as to why the app doesn’t really work that well.”
This could be true, if the app’s intention is to have people actually date and begin relationships as a result of their interactions on the platform. But labeling apps like Tinder as dating apps could be misleading: Many users don’t use them for “dating” at all. 
“It’s like going to a zoo or an art museum but for people,” said Kiki Lee, a sophomore majoring in sound design. “You get to see who’s actually out there, and you get to see how they get to describe themselves. It’s like a gallery of people, and I like learning about new people.” 
Tinder was launched in 2012 and has managed to pervade social culture over the past eight years. But it has also appeared to serve as a joke or as a way for older generations to point out the technological impact on genuine human interaction.
“I have fun swiping when I’m bored,” said Abigail Rowland, a sophomore majoring in theatre. “I feel like it’s the only one where you’re not expected to actually want to go on dates with the people.” 
Some users do want to go on dates from the app, but the results are often not as effective as they may hope. 
Abbey Harris, a sophomore majoring in theatre, used Tinder regularly but never felt her dates were particularly memorable or significant. 
“Call me a romantic, but I’d rather it be some sort of fun story I get to tell or has some weird amount of magic to it,” Harris said.
Tinder has made recent efforts to improve its brand image and connect to its largest user base — young adults in college. According to The New York Times, more than 50 percent of Tinder users are between 18 and 25 years old. 
In order to engage this demographic, Tinder released the “Tinder U” function last August. Students enrolled in four-year universities can enable a filter that optimizes results for fellow university students, either on their own campuses or nearby.  Tinder even employs “Tinder U Campus Ambassadors” to promote the app on college campuses. 
Despite these efforts, some students are still staying away from the app. Marcus Abundis, a junior majoring in theatre, feels a sense of guilt and desperation whenever he downloads a dating app. 
“It feels like cheating the game of how traditional being social and finding people really is,” Abundis said.
The disingenuity stems not just from Tinder itself, but from what its presentation implies, according to Jordan Kessler, a junior majoring in theatre. Most of the screen is taken up by the user’s images, and a bio is only revealed after either tapping through their initial photo or by tapping a small information icon in the bottom right corner. 
“I want to be someone that can find genuine connection with another person, and I don’t know if that’s possible when we’re both entering a relationship immediately under the pretenses of having some sort of sexual tension … all you’re presented with is the person’s picture,” Kessler said.
Much like how dating websites have become less popular among younger audiences, some feel that dating apps are headed down the same path. Michael O’Malley, a junior majoring in business administration, feels that while dating apps have replaced dating websites, neither option has lasting power. 
“Not only are they killing off their population of kids our age through either finding relationships or getting tired of the app, but I feel like they’re not attracting new audiences properly,” O’Malley said. 
O’Malley said he sees Tinder as more of a means of entertainment rather than a legitimate form of dating. 
But, according to sophomore Ben Wendel, who is majoring in theatre, Tinder is often used for something other than developing real relationships. 
Wendel used to use dating apps frequently, but not for going on dates. 
“For a large part of my time here, I was looking just for sex,” Wendel said. “The concept of asking someone on a date was just not something I ever thought about … When I was like ‘Oh, I want a relationship,’ I was like, ‘I need to hook up with someone and turn it into a relationship of some kind.’” 
This is not an unfamiliar concept. Rowland said she has a similar perspective on the progression of relationships on campus: people go to parties, hook up with someone, then potentially have a relationship with them. 
“[The process] is fun, it’s not a bad thing, but it just seems to be the thing and I’m over it,” Rowland said. 
Other students expressed their lack of enjoyment with hook-up culture as well. Abundis said when he first hooked up with someone at USC, they saw him on campus after the fact but didn’t acknowledge his existence.
“That’s just an aspect of hook-up culture that will always be there,” Abundis said. “But I don’t like that part so that’s made me not like the whole hookup culture.” 
The disillusionment seems to not just surround Tinder, but rather disingenuous connections in general. Kessler said both party culture and bar culture give off a similar sense of surface level connection as dating apps. 
“If I meet you at a bar, I already have negative presuppositions about your intentions,” Kessler said.
She prefers to meet people in real life situations that highlight a shared experience or interest. But an emphasis on genuine connection does not always equate to committed, monogamous relationships. Some students want casual dating to become normal on campus. 
“People should just be honest with themselves about what they want and where they’re going,” Lee said. “‘Cause if you don’t want to be in a relationship, that’s totally fine, but you’ve got to be honest with the person you’re seeing or going on dates with.” 
So for those who were thinking of swiping right on love this Valentine’s Day, they may want to reconsider and look somewhere other than their phones. 
“I just want to keep living my life the way that I like to live my life,” Kessler said, “And it would be nice if someone were to join me.”

There is a scene in the 2004 live-action film “Thunderbirds”: Lady Penelope is in danger. Dressed from head to toe in baby pink and sporting her windswept blonde hairdo, the British aristocrat-turned-agent screams for help, having been handcuffed by a criminal mastermind in the main vault of the Bank of London. She is a damsel in distress, waiting for her knight in shining armor.
For Harry, watching this scene 13 years ago marked the beginning of his journey into discovering his kinks — sexual desires considered outside of the norm.
“I found I enjoyed [the scene], and that didn’t make sense to me,” said Harry, a member of the Los Angeles kink community who is “out” about his persona. “I did some research, and I found out that bondage … a lot of people discover their kink through it, and that led me [through] research and self-discovery.”
When Harry, who asked that his last name be withheld, began his freshman year at USC in August 2013, he was eager to look for places throughout Los Angeles where he could express and apply his “interesting kink.” Luckily, a friend approached him about a panel of experts who were speaking on a kink-related topic, which helped him find the Trojan Munch Club — otherwise known as Kinky Trojans. He later became one of the club’s presidents for two years before graduating in 2017.
According to Harry, Kinky Trojans was founded in Fall 2013 and was originally housed under the USC Queer and Ally Student Assembly until it split the following year. Since then, the club has cultivated a tight-knit community of kink-oriented people by hosting meetings where members can have open discourse on kink-related topics such as power dynamics, rope bondage, consent and the phenomenology of pain. 
“I was part of the club from the very beginning and, naturally, I began taking more and more leadership roles since I was out and could communicate with other members and reach out to the other members in the L.A. community,” Harry said.

BEING KINKY
When Harry first found out he was kinky, he did not know what it meant. 
“When you hear the word ‘kinky,’ everyone immediately gets a vision of someone clad in latex wearing six-inch boots, whipping somebody with a 10-foot whip that is on fire,” he said. “And simply put, that is not always the case.”
Harry said psychologists like to define normal sex, otherwise known as the “Look Ma, No Hands” approach. According to him, during normal sex, one man and one woman are together in the missionary style, with the man on top and the woman’s head on a pillow. Both should be achieving orgasm at the same time.
Being kinky, he said, is any deviation from that definition.
“People like to imagine kink as some gigantic, extravagant thing that you need incredible skill with ropes for, but if you like to do rope play, or if you like to wear lingerie, if you like to do it in any position that is not strictly missionary, that is considered kinky,” Harry said.
According to Harry, kink is not a spectrum — whether someone is kinky or not is “very black or white.”
“Just because you only like to do one kind of role play does not mean that you are any more or less kinky than everybody else,” Harry said. “My kinks are not your kinks, and that’s OK.”
Since his time with Kinky Trojans, Harry said he has become a better educator within the kink community. Aside from teaching classes and performing regular demonstrations for the public, he also works as a dungeon monitor at Threshold Society, a sex dungeon in North Hollywood.
INSIDE THE TROJAN MUNCH CLUB
According to Harry, Trojan Munch Club hosts several events every year to increase awareness about kink and, more importantly, highlight the importance of consent. For example, Harry said the club has hosted several guest speakers and conducted lectures on proper negotiation, during which members are taught to go over what they want to do with their partners in a sexual context, define their limits and establish ground rules for their interactions.
“The difference between kink and abuse is consent,” Harry said. “There is a reason that boxing is legal because two people consented to be hit by somebody else. If … I get hit by somebody, and I have huge bruises, then that is potentially ground for a lawsuit, but because I can say that I consented to these activities, that makes it a bit more of a legal grey area whether or not there should be severe punishment for the person who did that to me.”
According to the club’s current president, who goes by G, one of the most popular meetings is “Sex Toy Day,” which is held once a semester. On Sex Toy Day, members bring in different kinky implements, including canes, paddles, rope and floggers, which are passed around the room. Members engage in discussions about how to use them and what to look out for when buying them. 
Sex Toy Day even draws nonmembers who are eager to “get kicks” out of watching the members talk about their favorite sex toys. 
“Some people have some crazy stuff, so it’s fun to just tell everyone, ‘Yo, come show off your crazy stuff!’” G said. “A lot of people show up, especially because we sometimes get sponsors from sex shops, and so they send us gift baskets to give away. Starter stuff like a little mini paddle, some rope, miniature vibrators, and we just give it out.”  
Members also go on unofficial field trips to local toy shops and sex dungeons. Some destinations include Threshold; the Pleasure Chest, a sex toy store in West Hollywood; and Sanctuary LAX, an adult entertainment club in Lennox.
“Having a setup to do the more extravagant displays or acts are very expensive, and for people living in L.A. apartments, it’s hard to find space to do them,” G said. “[Dungeons] have all sorts of machinery and rigging … but also [for] people who are more situational-based in their kink, there’s a classroom, doctor’s office, so you can really get yourself in the headspace.”
During the field trips, members can only “survey” the dungeons, meaning that there is no exposure of genitals and no penetration allowed at the location. This allows members to focus on the bondage and pain aspects. However, G said customers can rent out the rooms and “do whatever [they] want.”
But according to Harry, experimenting with kink does not have to be costly. Members have taken trips to department stores like Target and Home Depot to find everyday objects they can use for their kink.
“Whenever I buy something for the kitchen, I normally buy two — one for the kitchen, one for the bedroom,” he said. 
Even though Kinky Trojans has been a recognized student organization for years, G said most of the USC community still has misconceptions about how the club operates. While there is a difference between what is taboo and what is “just weird,” G does not think kink needs to be normalized; however, he said he wishes students could talk about kink-related topics like BDSM without finding them inherently funny.
“They think that it’s some orgy that we’re throwing, which is like no, we’re just talking,” G said. “Would I just get together with a bunch of random people at USC and have sex? No, of course not … Some people do come in as a survey, and they just want to laugh at how weird it is, [but] we’re totally down to do that because it actually lets those people understand that these things aren’t evil.”

KINK IN POP CULTURE
During his senior year, Harry wrote his thesis on a topic he said needed to be properly addressed: kinkphobia, which often results in discriminating against someone because they are kinky.
“It is much like homophobia or racism or sexism,” Harry said. “That doesn’t sound like a big deal, but … kinky people have faced some form of discrimination — loss of housing, loss of jobs, loss of custody of children, there have been huge instances within the community where someone was found out for being kinky, and then a week later they were kicked out of their home.”
Harry said that according to his research, there have been several cases where couples have gone through divorces and brought up kink in legal disputes. He added that during custody battles, ex-spouses can lose their cases if they are revealed to be kinky. 
For example, a research article by Dr. Marty Klein and Dr. Charles Moser delves into a 2003 child custody case for Ed, an 11-year-old. When it was revealed that his mother Ann was involved in a sadomasochistic relationship with her boyfriend, the court limited her visitation and custody agreements and ended her alimony.
Kinkphobia has become more recognized with the box-office success of the “Fifty Shades of Grey” trilogy. The films, which delve into the erotic, sadomasochistic relationship between college graduate Anastasia Steele and business magnate Christian Grey, have served as a “huge contention” in the kink community, according to Harry. 
Using highlighters and sticky notes, Harry once analyzed all three novels the films were based on for a side project. He found that every 12 pages, there was something that “would be frowned upon or break some sort of rule in the kink community.” As such, the novels and films have started an ongoing cultural conversation about consent and proper kink practices.
Harry said that while everyone accepts that the relationship between Anastasia and Christian is a “recipe for disaster,” the films have also brought kink into the limelight.
“It did increase the number of people who are going out and exploring now,” he said. “And that’s important because if you think that you are the only person who is kinky, you are going to stay at home, you are not going to do research and you are going to hurt somebody or yourself. If you see … there are other people who are also into this, then you are more likely to engage with the community.”
In light of “Fifty Shades,” Harry mentioned two phrases everyone in the kink community should learn. First: One must never say that they have no limits. 
“If you say, ‘I have no limits,’ there are people who will abuse that,” Harry said. “As much as the kinky community is open, loving and sensual, there are people who hide inside of it … That’s the same with anything.”
And the “happier” of the two phrases is Harry’s three favorite words that he said everyone outside of the kinky community should also know: “At this time.”
“I’m not into rope at this time,” he said. “I do not consent to be spanked at this time. I am very, very into fire play at this time. Everyone is always evolving, and people are always discovering new things.”

A few weeks ago, I was approached by my editor to write a feature about people — especially single people — who dislike Valentine’s Day. I was excited! As a single person, I thought it would be fun to get the chance to talk to other people who wallowed in their singleness on the day of commercialized symbols of love: candy hearts, red roses, giant teddy bears.
I anticipated tales of anti-Valentine’s Day parties like the one Jessica Biel’s character threw in “Valentine’s Day” and visits to Melrose’s pop-up Breakup Bar. What I got, however, was the exact opposite — silence. 
After weeks of reaching out for interviews, tweeting, posting in Facebook groups, having friends of friends text their group chats, I had nothing. Even though people rallied around the idea (I had several likes, comments and texts), virtually no one actually wanted to talk to me about their personal relationships or feelings. 
One girl completely ghosted me. A screenshot of our texts would show a plethora of blue iMessage bubbles from my end with no responses in return. 
The one interview I managed to conduct was with someone who hated the holiday not for romantic reasons but instead because the holiday has strayed so far from its religious origins.   
I felt pretty defeated. This rallying story for the singles at USC couldn’t exist without student testimonies. Why were people so quick to show off their singleness on social media yet so shy to talk about it in person? 
I decided to reach out to experts who could help explain this phenomenon to me. 
Mary Andres is a professor of clinical education at the Rossier School of Education. She’s taught at USC for 24 years and co-leads the Masters in Marriage and Family Therapy program. 
“People have a hard time switching from online contributing to actual conversations … people will ‘like’ things, but to do the extra effort?” Andres said. “They’ll say ‘oh it’s a great idea, I’m happy to follow and passively read whatever you collect, but I don’t want to contribute to the collecting.’” 
Alla Branzburg, adjunct professor at the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, is a psychotherapist specializing in relationships. She also said social media can be more of a hindrance than help when it comes to outreach. 
“Facebook liking, or Instagram liking, it’s almost like a drug: It’s addictive,” Branzburg said. “People do get addicted to attention. And if they don’t get it, it makes them depressed or anxious.” 
But beyond social media’s shortcomings,  USC singles’ silence is part of a much larger cultural phenomenon. 
“With [singledom] is shame that comes up for people, where they feel like they are less than because of how the culture endorses coupledom as the preferred mode for being,” Andres said. “Even if they don’t physically feel shamed, they don’t have the vocabulary for it because there isn’t a space where we talk about what are you doing as a single person the way people talk about couples.” 
Branzburg also discussed an innate human fear of judgment. 
“I think it’s about feelings most of all, because no one wants to be hurt,” Branzburg said. “Nobody wants to be hurt by any callous comment about their feelings or be judged, misperceived or misinterpreted.” 
Branzburg said that a single comment or like is okay because it’s a low barrier to entry. But speaking in person about one’s relationship status opens them up to avoidable vulnerability. Therefore, single people often pass on such conversations. 
Andres said such negative connotations with singledom result from the glorification of relationships in the U.S. 
“When [single] folks are saying ‘yes’ online, and then going silent, it’s because they aren’t giving themselves permission,” Andres said. “They are not … supporting other people saying ‘this is my life, and my life has legitimacy.’ This is just as important as your life, whether you’re married with kids or whether you’re engaged, or partnered, or whatever.” 
Andres referred me to a book titled “Singled Out: How Singles Are Stereotyped, Stigmatized, and Ignored, and Still Live Happily Ever After,” by Bella DePaulo, a professor of psychology at the University of Santa Barbara. DePaulo coined the term “mental blanketing” in her book. 
“[Mental blanketing] is like mind control, only without the conspiratorial undertones.” DePaulo said in her book. “At a time when marriage is so inessential, mental blanketing aims to instill in an entire populace the unshakable belief that marriage is exactly what it is not: utterly and uniquely transformational.” 
Andres explained that the U.S. allocates federal funding to aspects of relationships, such social security benefits, tuition remission and tax benefits. 
“This idea of marriage or coupledom is that we have this blanket, we have this endorsement, that this is the best way to be. Every love story tells you that you will be transformed, you will become a better human being if you’re partnered,” Andres said. “That’s the weird part, because of this blanketing in our culture that says you should be in a committed relationship, that’s the safe, socially prescribed pathway towards adulthood.” 
So, part of the reason why people didn’t want to talk to me is that society tells them they should be in a relationship. At USC, though, it’s not that simple to date, or even want to date.
Branzburg thinks many millennials view relationships as just an extra obligation. 
“Contemporary parents conditioned their children to know they can do anything they want,” Branzburg said. “Being a student at such an amazing institution as USC … raises this expectation [of] ‘I want to meet somebody on my level.’” 
The competitive academic environment on campus seeps into other aspects of life, such as romantic ones. The choice and diversity made available by living in Los Angeles doesn’t help, either. 
“We live in L.A., where there are so many single people well into their 30s, because there’s so much choice,” Andres said. “It’s kind of like, ‘Why should I go through feeling insecure or disappointed in somebody who’s human and flawed, when I can just swipe and go out with somebody new?’ There’s a lack of maturing that happens because we have so much access.” 
Another reason why many choose to be single is prioritization in a student’s life. 
Andres spoke about how academics, extracurriculars and work take precedent in many students’ lives. Students commit to numerous activities and interests as part of their personal development leaving little room for a relationship. 
“Some people are consciously choosing to devalue relationships, and they’re fine with it, but they don’t necessarily have a language for that,” Andres said. “So they’ll just say, ‘Oh I’m too busy,’ instead of saying ‘I’m doing exactly what I want to do. I’m not apologizing for it.’” 
Branzburg hopes that students recognize the inability to be confident in their singleness as a societal flaw. 
“Being single is not a bad thing. Being single means freedom, means exploration, means looking forward into the future,” Branzburg said. “It doesn’t mean that I am not socially apt. It doesn’t mean that I am not a cool person, or I am not a trendy person. It just means that I am waiting to make my choice, and therefore I am in control of my own situation.” 
Andres pointed to China’s Singles’ Day, a shopping holiday that boasts more online sales than Cyber Monday, as an example of reclaiming singleness. 
She hopes more similar trends will spring up in the U.S. 
“It’s this whole idea of rebelling against [relationship culture],” Andres said. “There’s a whole culture that has rebelled against the idea of romance and Valentine’s Day, just like ‘what about us?’ It’s a way of taking back the power.” 
And take back the power we shall. With that being said, are any single people out there ready to talk?

Feminist author Roxane Gay and businesswoman Amanda Nguyen spoke about sexual assault  at a Visions and Voices event titled “Survivors Rise: Roxane Gay and Amanda Nguyen in Conversation,” Wednesday night at Bovard Auditorium. Following the event, Gay tweeted that she felt unsafe on stage after multiple audience members disrupted the Q&A portion of the conversation with inflammatory comments. 
Sponsored by the Asian Pacific American Student Services, the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and the USC Speakers Committee, the event was presented as a part of the Provost’s series on the University’s “wicked problems” to address sexual assault in the current political climate. Tara McPherson, a professor at the School of Cinematic Arts, moderated the conversation.
Both rape survivors, Gay and Nguyen discussed their personal experiences with assault, as well as the conversation surrounding assault Nguyen is the founder and chief executive officer of Rise, a nonprofit focused on civil rights.
The conversation began with Nguyen detailing her experience with sexual assault. She said that in Massachusetts, where the incident occurred, she discovered her rape kit would be destroyed before the statute of limitations expired. 
Nguyen said this experience pushed her to work with her nonprofit to create the Survivors’ Bill of Rights, which outlines the right to access information and resources after sexual assault encounters. The Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights was signed into law during the Obama administration. 
“I told myself, ‘Oh my gosh I have to make a choice, my justice or my career,’” Nguyen said. “That’s not a choice that anyone should ever have to make.” 
During her introduction, Gay read an excerpt from her 2017 book “Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body,” in which she connects the repercussions of her trauma with her disdain for physical exercise. At the event, she touched on her struggles with writing the memoir in the last few years. 
“With ‘Hunger’, the thought of having these things out in the world terrified me,” Gay said. “People tend to weaponize it and use it against you.” 
At the event, McPherson delved into her experience with the secrecy surrounding assault in the ‘80s, as well as the recent increase in having public, open discourse about sexual assault and rape, especially in light of the #MeToo movement. 
“I think we have simply reached a critical mass of suffering,” Gay said. “Women and men suffering from sexual assault have new ways of talking about it.” 
Gay and Nguyen noted that social media has served as a key aspect of the recent conversational nature of sexual assault. According to McPherson, victims can use social media to share their experiences among one another, forming connections that weren’t previously possible.
“These spaces have always existed, but with social media, these spaces have more breadth than ever before,” Gay said. “I think right now, what we’re seeing is, in terms of vulnerability, is that many of us who have these kind of stories recognize [social media’s] the only way to really be heard.” 
Nguyen also spoke about the injustice she noticed in the democratic nature of the government. 
“I think that there is massive gaslighting in this country that people don’t fully understand that they have the power to change the law,” Nguyen said. “This country, as a democracy, should be of the people, by the people, for the people.” 
During the Q&A portion of the conversation, a member of RevCom, a revolutionary communist party, drew ties between Nguyen’s passage of the Survivors’ Bill of Rights and the alleged war crimes under the Obama administration. The question ended with the protester saying that putting a female in charge of the current government system would not change any current injustice. 
“I also think we need to talk about the misogyny of your question,” Gay said. “I understand the critique, but 45 men led this country to where we are today … to suggest that there is a problem with having a woman as president when men have fucked it up…”
Shortly after the question, another audience member interrupted, saying he was skipped over, prompting shocked responses from the speakers. After the event ended,  Gay tweeted, “I don’t like feeling unsafe on stage, but tonight that sure happened.” 
“As a member of the audience, I also felt unsafe, so I can only imagine your experience,” Twitter user ‘LaurenLevy’ commented. 
Despite the disruption, students said they enjoyed the conversation and the discussion it prompted. 
“It was a good moment to just be surrounded by so many people that feel pretty much on the same page about what the guest speakers were talking about,” said Abeer Tijani, a sophomore majoring in global health and Spanish. “It made me hopeful for wanting to incite change and fix things, especially because I have a lot of friends who have gone through things similar to the #MeToo movement.”

The $215 million class-action settlement agreement for former patients of former USC gynecologist George Tyndall is now moving forward.
The agreement, filed by USC students and alumni Tuesday, outlines the settlement distribution for an estimated 17,000 former patients of Tyndall, who was accused of sexual misconduct by approximately 400 women. It will require the University to implement new procedures for dealing with incidents of sexual assault and misconduct.
“I am encouraged by today’s settlement filing, which takes another important step in healing our community,” Interim President Wanda Austin wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Every affected individual is a member of the Trojan Family, and we care deeply about their well-being.” 
The class counsel said in a press release that the agreement is still subject to court approval. The settlement agreement obtained by the Daily Trojan states the University will be required to implement several reforms to ensure future student safety. 
“USC must implement a series of reforms — with oversight from the court and class counsel — to ensure the safety of its students going forward,” the class counsel wrote.
If the settlement is approved, the court will appoint an independent women’s health advocate to hold USC accountable and ensure that sexual or racial misconduct complaints are investigated. An independent consultant will also make recommendations — which will be released to the public — for the way the University addresses such issues.
USC will also be required to staff a female physician, establish online and offline channels for anonymous patient feedback and adopt “sensitive exam” practices consistent with the policies outlined by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Students would also have to undergo mandatory training to prevent future campus sexual misconduct, according to the settlement.
To implement the reform, the class counsel will rely on the Equitable Relief Committee, which will comprise one expert selected by the class counsel, a second individual selected by USC and a third individual chosen by the first two members of the committee. The committee will begin working Monday to create effective and attainable goals and discuss deadlines based on the listed reforms. It will provide an update 60 days from Monday.
The settlement also requires the University to hire an independent task force member, appointed by class counsel, onto the Survey Task Force for the Spring 2019 Campus Climate Survey, which will gather information regarding students’ experiences with sexual misconduct and harassment and their overall knowledge of resources. The University has already begun working toward this goal.
Alumnae Elisabeth Treadway and Shannon O’Conner, who both came forward as victims of Tyndall, expressed support for the settlement. 
Treadway, who graduated from USC in 2001, had an appointment with Tyndall in 1997 when she was a sophomore. She said Tyndall did not allow her to be covered during the examination and touched her inappropriately as he diagnosed her with herpes.
“The most important thing here is that the women of the University [and] other universities are safe,” Treadway said. “I don’t hold USC as an institution accountable so much as I hold the people who knew accountable and Tyndall accountable. I fully believe there will be a criminal investigation and I would be more than happy to testify.” 
Tyndall also played with and made comments about Treadway’s vaginal piercing, saying she should keep it secret so that people would not discover “what kind of woman she was.”
O’Conner, a 1995 graduate, said she visited Tyndall in 1993 for birth control pills. During the examination, Tyndall thrust his fingers into her vagina without gloves, causing her to panic. 
“I don’t hate USC,” O’Conner said. “It’s completely the opposite. I just hope that this lawsuit — I know it will — implement changes for years to come at the University that will protect women from this ever happening again. That is the most important.”
She said she expressed her discomfort multiple times and tried to pull away, but he grabbed her hip and held her down. After the appointment, she told a nurse at the front desk about her encounter, but her concerns were brushed away.
Treadway and O’Conner both plan to be part of the class settlement.
Attorney John Manly, who is serving as counsel for 185 victims in the case, said the settlement is “horrible” and believes the agreement shows how USC does not care for its female students. 
“If you’re interested in protecting doctors who sexually assault their patients, it’s a great settlement,” Manly said. “It provides no insight on who knew what [and] when. It gives no real changes … provides no accountability, does not explain how this was allowed to go on for 30 years and, basically, it only guarantees someone who was sexually assaulted by their doctors $2,500.” 
The agreement outlines the compensation distribution plan for all former Tyndall patients treated for women’s health issues from Aug. 14, 1989, to June 21, 2016, who choose to participate in the settlement. 
“The $215 million in monetary compensation provided by the agreement recognizes all women who were patients of Tyndall, gives survivors a choice on how they want to participate and does so in a setting that is more private and immediate than would occur through litigation,” the class counsel wrote.
The claim process for eligible students and alumni seeking compensation through the settlement is divided into a three-tiered plan, according to the settlement. Every class member in Tier 1 will receive an initial payment of $2,500, along with eligibility for Tier 2 or 3 payments. 
“Those who can be identified through USC’s existing health center records will be automatically mailed a … payment check … once the settlement is effective,” the suit read. “Those class members who could not be identified through USC’s records must submit a simple signed Statement of Class Membership Form to receive their … payment.” 
Tier 2 and Tier 3 will compensate victims between $7,500 and $20,000, and $7,500 and $250,000, respectively. For both tiers, the suit claims that a team of gynecology, psychology, psychiatry and post-traumatic stress disorder experts will review and allocate the payments. The settlement states that Tier 2 class members who choose to provide additional information detailing their experiences with Tyndall may be eligible for Tier 3 payments.
Manly said, however, that the sum of money allocated to victims pales in comparison to the consequences of the Michigan State case, for which he negotiated a settlement for a sexual assault case against former doctor Larry Nassar that settled for $500 million. Manly said that for the 332 victims, the average compensation payment was nearly $1.25 million.
“When we go to USC, we all talk about how we’re members of a family,” Manly said. “But, what family does that to their children? Or their mothers or their sisters? It’s just despicable, and it makes me embarrassed and ashamed.” 
Attorney Gloria Allred, who is serving as counsel for victims in the state class action against USC, expressed frustration with the settlement. 
“We believe that it is extremely important for the victims to know what the USC administration knew and when they first discovered  the prior complaints made by some of the 17,000 USC students Dr. George Tyndall purportedly examined,” Allred wrote in a statement emailed to the Daily Trojan. “Until discovery (interrogatories and depositions) is conducted in the pending state cases, answers to the many questions posed about USC’s culpability and gross failure to supervise Dr. Tyndall will remain unanswered.” 
Allred believes the payment victims will receive is a “wholly inadequate” sum of damage compensation. She also plans to object to the settlement. 
“We will be objecting to the Federal Court settlement as being … premature and recommending to our 58 clients to opt out of the settlement (which they have an absolute legal right to do) until discovery is conducted in the state court proceedings,” Allred wrote. “We will continue to litigate for them until the full extent of USC’s reckless and shameful conduct is determined.” 
O’Conner and Treadway said they are frustrated by Allred and Manly’s decision to object the settlement. Both of their experiences helped shape the class counsel’s settlement.
“It is offensive to me that he criticized how I choose to resolve this,” O’Conner said. “It’s my choice. If people want to make other choices, I support that. Everybody knows what’s best for themselves, but it doesn’t give me the right to criticize anybody else’s choice, and I don’t like having my choice criticized. It is very insensitive and selfish.” 
The University wrote in a statement emailed to the Daily Trojan that USC has been implementing changes to prevent misconduct and promote student health on campus. 
“In addition to the monetary relief offered in this settlement, USC continues to make sweeping changes … including establishing an Office of Professionalism and Ethics and an Office of Ombuds Services,” the University wrote. “The University is also strengthening operating and oversight procedures at the Student Health Center, including making female physicians available to all patients, and engaging an independent women’s health advocate to ensure any complaints of improper conduct are investigated and resolved by appropriate university officials and authorities, among others.” 
The settlement is currently being evaluated by the court to ensure it is fair and meets federal rules. The court will call the class counsel to reconvene on April 1 to ask questions about the settlement. Once the judge rules that the settlement meets the criteria, a notice will be issued and packages will be sent to all women who attended USC from 1989 to 2016, the period during which Tyndall worked at the health center. 
After hearing from women who choose to step forward as part of the class, the settlement will be brought to the court again for final approval. The class counsel is aiming to reach final approval by Aug. 26. 
“Providing a fair and respectful resolution to as many former, impacted patients as possible, and making impactful changes that strengthen our university continue to be our top priorities,” Austin wrote. 
Editor’s note: A previous version of the article contained two errors. In the article, Shannon O’Conner’s name was misspelled. Attorney John Manly negotiated a settlement, not a class-action in the case against former doctor Larry Nassar.  The Daily Trojan regrets these errors. This article was also updated to clarify that the press release was sent out on behalf of the plaintiff’s class counsel.

USC is experiencing a defining moment, Interim President Wanda Austin said in her State of the University Address Wednesday afternoon at the Town and Gown ballroom. In her speech, Austin said she chose to talk about the topics she would want to understand if she were one of the faculty members in attendance, including updates on USC’s medical enterprises and the financial health of the University. 
“I want you to leave here today with confidence that we’re able to make the necessary investments in the future because USC’s financial health remains very strong and stable,” Austin said. 
During her speech, Austin only vaguely referenced the news about two significant controversies that occurred Tuesday. On Tuesday morning, six gay and bisexual former students sued the University and a former campus men’s sexual health doctor for alleged sexual harassment, among other grievances. The Los Angeles Times also reported updates on USC’s $215 million class-action settlement involving the patients of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall on Tuesday. 
“Over the past year, we’ve confronted some unexpected issues and costs,” Austin said. “And just yesterday, we found out we have some more unexpected issues that we’re going to have to address. Those issues are difficult, but we are making many important changes that will strengthen the University moving forward.” 
Among the changes Austin listed were a number of new committees and offices that were established under her interim administration, such as the Office of the Ombuds, the President’s Culture Commission and the Office of Professionalism and Ethics. 
This year, the University is taking a new, cross-campus approach to address student wellness with its Collective Impact plan, led by the Office of Health Promotion Strategy and Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry. 
Austin said USC is one of the first universities in the United States to create a wellness program that stretches across the entire institution. USC has already implemented training, retreats and assessments that nearly 4,000 people have participated in, Austin said.  
“At USC, we’re committed to making wellness a priority,” Austin said. “In the past, we’ve focused much of our efforts on supporting our students … we’re now expanding our efforts to faculty and staff.” 
Vice Provost for Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention Varun Soni said he appreciated that Austin mentioned some of his office’s work. 
“We’ve been doing a lot of work across the University to think about how we create a culture where students, faculty and staff thrive,” Soni said. “To have [that work] highlighted as one of the University priorities makes me feel really good about the direction of the University.” 
Austin also stressed the importance of USC’s various medical endeavors. She said more than 40 percent of the University faculty is employed by the Keck School of Medicine. Many of Keck’s buildings are located on the Health Sciences Campus, where Austin delivered a similar address earlier this week. 
“No matter where you work at USC, it’s important for you to understand the growing importance our medical enterprise has on the future of our entire university,” Austin said. “Our medical enterprise now represents 55 percent of the University’s total operating revenue and has been the fastest growing segment of our income since 2011.”  
But, Austin said, USC’s medical programs and three hospitals are focused on more than turning a profit. 
“We do all the things you’d expect from a private hospital or medical center,” Austin said. “But, we have to be equally prepared to treat patients with a common cold, as well as those with the rarest medical challenges.” 
Austin, who will be leaving her position at the end of the University’s presidential search, spoke briefly about what USC’s future holds. She said the success of the University depends on shared governance, in which every USC community member’s voice is heard. 
“Our faculty, staff and students all bring an incredible breadth of knowledge and experiences to our community,” Austin said. “If we’re not listening to all of those voices [and] including all of those perspectives, how can we possibly make the best decisions for the future of our university?”

After falling to the Chinese national team 10-5 in an exhibition match Tuesday, the No. 1 USC women’s water polo team looks to open conference play with a win this Saturday against Indiana.
The first quarter of Tuesday’s exhibition match against China showcased strong defensive efforts from both squads. Senior goalie Amanda Longan, last week’s MPSF Player of the Week, blocked several of China’s early offensive chances and held the Chinese to a single penalty goal in the quarter. USC held a 2-1 lead early in the second, but was overcome by 5 unanswered goals from China later that period. The Trojans were unable to catch up in the second half.
Such a performance is highly uncharacteristic for a Trojan squad that previously averaged 15.91 goals scored and just 2.83 goals against this season.
“Definitely one of the things that we’re going to continue to work on is not giving up goals,” senior driver Courtney Fahey said. “It’s our main goal to hold opponents to the least amount of goals possible. But I think the main difference [in the game against China] was that we just need to be more focused. That’s something that we’re going to work on in the future for sure, starting now.”
Saturday’s match against Indiana will be the Trojans’ first game outside of the invitational setting this season. The single-game weekend allows the Trojans to tailor their preparation solely to Indiana, a familiar opponent from earlier this season and from years past.
“We had three new foreign girls who came this semester, so toward the beginning we were really focusing on the basics, but now we’re focusing more on preparing for certain teams,” Fahey said of the transition from playing in tournaments to facing conference opponents. “Every team plays different, every team plays different offense, every team plays defense differently, so we just have to prepare for what we know and what they’ve done in past years.”
Compared to the Trojans’ dominance up to this point, Indiana has had a rough start to its season. Although the Hoosiers beat No. 15 UC San Diego in their season opener, they have conceded all six games since then. When the Trojans and Hoosiers met earlier this season in the UCSB Winter Invite, USC came out on top with an 11-1 victory.
One source of the Hoosiers’ early struggles has been their defense, which has allowed an average of 13.85 goals per game. This is problematic when facing a Trojan team with numerous scoring threats, including last week’s MPSF Newcomer of the Week freshman driver Alejandra Aznar. Aznar scored in all four games during last weekend’s Triton Invitational championship campaign, demonstrating her ability to perform against opponents of all calibers.
Even if Indiana’s defense can contain the Women of Troy’s offensive firepower, they must also get more creative with their attack in order to put up points against the MPSF’s No. 1 defense. The Hoosiers’ 1-goal performance earlier this season against the Trojans cannot be repeated if they are to have a chance at claiming victory Saturday.
Despite Indiana’s lackluster offensive and defensive efforts thus far, the Trojans aim to avoid overconfidence and use each game as an opportunity for improvement.
“Our goal is just to … not get complacent in our conference play and get better every game, give every team the best that we can, and win a national championship,” Fahey said.
The Trojans will host the Hoosiers at 4 p.m. Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatic Center. After this conference game, the Trojans will head to an invite in Irvine before facing more MPSF action in March.

The No. 14 men’s volleyball team hits the road this week for two conference matches against No. 9 Stanford Thursday and No. 8 Brigham Young University Saturday.
Although facing two ranked opponents heightens the stakes, senior libero Matt Douglas said the Trojans are preparing for these games as they would for any other match, focusing on scouting to ensure that they are ready to go. 
“We’ve been watching a lot of tape and working out the kinks that have plagued us in the past matches … so that we’re good to go for this coming week,” he said. “We know exactly what they’re going to bring. I think the sense that we’re ready to prove ourselves, that we could beat some of these ranked teams is just that extra incentive to work that much harder.”
USC holds a 65-33 record against Stanford all-time and has dominated its last three meetings. Sophomore opposite Jaylen Jasper and senior outside hitter Jordan Ewert lead the Cardinal offense with 161 and 147 kills, respectively. Junior setter Paul Bischoff sets them up with 418 assists overall this season. Jasper is also a player to watch on the baseline with 11 aces this season. On the defensive end, Ewert and redshirt senior libero Kyle Dagostino lead with 82 and 81 digs, respectively, and sophomore middle blocker Kyler Presho has accumulated 39 blocks this season. 
The Trojans lag behind in their series against BYU, trailing the all-time series 43-22 and falling in the last six matches against the Cougars. USC has not won at BYU since 1996. Sophomore opposite hitter Gabi Garcia Fernandez leads the Cougar offense with 111 kills this season. Junior setter Wil Stanley aids with 231 assists. Garcia Fernandez, freshman outside hitter Davide Gardini and Stanley lead with 38, 35 and 30 digs, respectively.
Veteran leadership has been a strong force for USC. Outside hitters redshirt junior Jack Wyett and senior Ryan Moss lead with 121 and 118 kills, respectively on the season. Anchoring the defense, Douglas — this week’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Defensive Player of the Week — and Moss have put up 49 and 42 digs, and Moss has hit 26 blocks this season. Senior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso is a force on the baseline with 12 service aces this season. 
Douglas said that being on the road all weekend takes a toll both mentally and physically.
“Some of us older guys try to instill the younger guys with what it means to travel and keep it like a business trip in that sense and also to just enjoy the moment,” he said. 
The Trojans have been living up to their team motto of “resurgence” in their 50th season, making a strong comeback from last year’s disappointing 8-20 campaign. 
“In terms of underperforming in years past, especially last year, I think [resurgence] means making sure we’re focused this year and that we are winning games, not just competing, not just going through the motions and having something to prove a little bit, a little bit of a vengeance,” Douglas said.
Thursday’s game against Stanford tips off at 7 p.m. at the Maples Pavilion in Palo Alto. Saturday’s match against BYU begins at 6 p.m. at the Smith Fieldhouse in Provo, Utah.

After suffering back-to-back home losses, sloppy offensive play and a lackadaisical defensive effort in the second half at Stanford, the Trojans dropped their third straight game Wednesday. Although they led for much of the contest, the Trojans suffered from poor execution late in the game, resulting in a 79-76 loss to Stanford. 
“The biggest takeaway is our upperclassmen,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We have to finish games and they have to do a better job.”
With just two games separating the second and ninth seed in Pac-12 standings, each game is a must-win for USC if they have any hope of securing a first round bye in the Pac-12 tournament — a privilege granted to the conference’s top-four seeds. 
Junior forward Nick Rakocevic, the Pac-12 leader in double-doubles and two-time Conference Player of the Week, came off the bench for just the second time all season. It didn’t seem to affect the big man’s game, however, as he made his first three shots upon entering the contest. 
Much like the Trojans’ first meeting against Stanford, in which he posted 23 points and 10 rebounds, Rakocevic was an interior problem the Cardinals couldn’t seem to solve, as the forward finished with 15 points and 11 rebounds Wednesday.
Freshman guard Kevin Porter  had by far his best performance since his return from suspension, displaying several of the qualities that cause many to tout him as a potential first-round draft pick. A combination of strong finishes, shifty dribbling and decisive dimes pushed the freshman to 10 points in the first half.
The first half effort from Porter was the most aggressive assertion of his talent all season. At one point, as the Trojans found themselves on the wrong end of a 15-4 run, the freshman beat his man off the dribble and powered a dunk through the rim and into the third row. 
A lackluster start to the second half filled with lazy passes and matador defense from the Trojans led to Stanford cutting their deficit to just 2 points five minutes after halftime. 
Senior forward Bennie Boatwright and junior guard Jonah Mathews tried to slow the Cardinal momentum, drilling back-to-back corner threes, but the hot shooting didn’t transfer over to the remainder of the game.
Ultimately, the sloppy play on offense, along with a lethargic effort on defense, led to USC trailing for the first time since a layup from Stanford sophomore forward Oscar da Silva placed the Trojans down 2-0 at the start of the game. Foul trouble for two of USC head coach Andy Enfield’s best playmakers, Boatwright and Porter, left the Trojans with no clear weapon to stop the bleeding on the offensive end. 
Stanford’s 7-foot senior center Josh Sharma struck USC through the heart with each rim-rattling dunk he delivered. The Trojans’ failure to box Sharman out evidenced a lack of effort and resulted in Sharma finishing the game with 14 points on 7-of-9 shooting.
After being tied at 64 points with just under six minutes to go in the second half, the Trojans operated their best half-court offense of the game, but each USC layup or set of free throws was met with a Stanford 3-pointer, keeping the Cardinal in the game. Furthermore, A lazy pass from Rakocevic to Boatwright resulted in a turnover that gave Stanford the opportunity to win the game. 
On the next possession, Stanford freshman point guard Bryce Wills blew past his man and finished through three Trojans to push the Cardinal to a 77-76 lead. Boatwright’s heroics fell short, as his go-ahead jumper attempt hit the front of the rim and signaled the end of the game.
“He [Boatwright] had a good look and just missed it,” Enfield said. “That didn’t decide the game.”
USC shot well from outside, making 7-of-12 from beyond the arc. This clip stood in stark contrast to Stanford’s 31.6 percent mark from downtown. The Cardinal responded with a well-rounded offensive effort; five players scored in double-digits, led by sophomore forward KZ Okpala’s 18 points. Okpala was a menace on both ends, contributing four steals in addition to his offensive work.
Boatwright led the Trojans with 19 points, followed closely by Mathews’ 16 points. Porter struggled to gain any traction in the second half, going scoreless and finishing the game with a 4-of-12 shooting performance.
This was an even game in virtually every statistical category. No team dominated the glass or forced a lopsided number of turnovers, and both sides had to know this bitterly contested conference matchup would go down to the wire. In these types of games, the team that executes best in the final minutes will emerge victorious, and on Wednesday night, that team was Stanford.
The Trojans will attempt to bounce back Saturday when they face Cal on the road at 5 p.m.

The teeth-grinding thing about the NFL is that it never really changes.
You always think that maybe the league or the teams or the coaches or the players have learned. Maybe this time, we’ll get lucky or just smart. Maybe this time, an abusive player will stay kicked out of the league for good. Maybe this time, a team won’t come to the defense of a man who beats women. Maybe this time, the NFL will find a way to keep its violence between the hash marks.
But the thing about the NFL is that it is relentlessly, mind-numbingly stubborn. Beyond all hope, reason and logic, the members of the NFL refuse to learn basic lessons. They will repeat their mistakes again and again, until it becomes impossible to call them “mistakes.” And instead, it becomes clear that the members of the National Football League truly don’t care about anything except winning football games.
If you can’t tell, I’m mad. Furious, really. I’m mad because this week, the Cleveland Browns signed running back Kareem Hunt, a superstar in the backfield who used to play for my beloved Chiefs, until a video leaked of him kicking and slurring at a woman outside of a hotel room in the offseason. The Chiefs — who had previously failed to investigate the incident, instead believing Hunt’s claim that nothing had happened — promptly cut our star running back, leaving the rest of the season on the shoulders of our kid genius quarterback Patrick Mahomes.
At the time, the Chiefs received lukewarm praise for finally doing the right thing, after doing the wrong thing when they thought they wouldn’t get caught. Now, Hunt is back in the league after spending just a few months out of work and even less time in therapy. He’ll probably break records next season and help Baker Mayfield to complete his transformation of Cleveland football. And so the cycle continues.
I’m mad about this situation for a lot of reasons, but mainly because I am someone who believes in second chances. While I do think that certain crimes such as domestic violence or sexual assault deserve an immediate one-way ticket home from the league (Hey Tyreek Hill, you still suck), I don’t believe in a zero tolerance policy for all crimes. I believe that there is a gray area of forgiveness for most people. Without it, we wouldn’t see players like Eagles center Jason Kelce fight to overcome anger management issues.
The thing that really gets me about Hunt’s firing and hiring is that it wasn’t used as an opportunity to promote change or constructive growth in either Hunt or the league. If he had been investigated properly in February, the Chiefs would have found the tape of the incident before TMZ did. The team could have suspended him, gotten him into anger management programs, mandated that he work with programs for violence against women. Rather than hiding and then lashing out when it was caught for its cowardice, the organization could have stood up and helped a young man grow.
I’m not making excuses for any violent athlete. Violence is never acceptable and should always be punished firmly, in any and every area of society. But the NFL fields a large group of young men from rough backgrounds, men who were not taught to channel their emotions through anything but aggression and violence on the field. It’s not surprising that football has a violence problem — what is surprising is that the league continues to fail to take any steps toward actually fixing it.
Hunt made an effort to start therapy this year, mainly in hopes of earning redemption in the eyes of fans and owners. But he’s only been attending sessions for a handful of weeks and the likelihood of him staying in therapy now that his contract with the Browns is inked is low. That’s a loss, first and foremost, for Hunt. He made a grave error, and although he paid a price, he wasn’t necessarily given the tools to grow from it. 
Football teams spend millions of dollars and thousands of hours training their athletes to be stronger, faster and smarter on the field. It’s time that these teams also put the same level of dedication into teaching their athletes how to think and feel outside the lines. 
From the guaranteed mental and emotional effects of CTE to the common issue of anger management in young football players, the league is wracked by mental health issues, yet it simply plays blind to any issue that doesn’t involve football. As a league, however, shuttling players from one team to another in an attempt to react to scandal simply can’t be the answer anymore.
It’s always the right time for the NFL to acknowledge this problem. The question is when — or, more likely, if — it will ever actually wake up.

Junior JaBrea Patterson-West never aspired to be an art curator.
Growing up in Newark, NJ, she would take trips across the river to New York City, where she would wander through the halls of museums like the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and stand mesmerized by the vast decorative paintings that  hung on the walls.
Even then, the idea that art was a profession she could study never occurred to her. She especially didn’t think that she, as a black woman, could aspire to one day conquer it.
“I was always taught that if you weren’t a STEM major, or a major that could traditionally make a lot of money, that you were basically wasting your time,” she said.
A spring admit, Patterson-West came to USC as a pre-med student. But  her general biology lectures felt unfulfilling. She felt stuck, as she was still adapting to university life and was hesitant to give up the academic goals she had had since childhood.
Then, she took her first art history course.
“I was thinking of all the things I could do,” she said. “And after I took that class, I was like, ‘OK, I can see myself doing this.’”
Patterson-West immediately dropped her pre-med studies and became an art history major. From there, her world began to quickly change. At the end of her first semester, she secured an internship at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. By Fall 2017, she was working  in the museum’s exhibition department, where she organized budgets and facilitated contracts between different institutions. Less than a year later, she was awarded the 2018-20 Mellon Undergraduate Curatorial Fellowship and now spends her days working in the museum’s modern art department. 
“In this short time, she has already demonstrated her ability to research works in the museums collection [and] join in departmental discussions,” said Stephanie Barron, a senior curator and department head of Modern Art at LACMA. “She is about to begin a writing project about works in the Collection that will be completed this summer, when she is working full time.”
As a Mellon Fellow, Patterson-West shadows Barron, attends meetings, visits galleries and assists on various projects within the department. 
“One of the important goals of the Mellon Fellow program is to mentor students to move their education forward post undergraduate and to apply and attend graduate school,” Barron said. “This is necessary to become competitive to enter the museum world. We will help JaBrea in this pursuit.”
Patterson-West credits her experiences at LACMA with opening her mind to the vast array of artistic possibilities that await her upon graduation. The discipline that stuck out to her the most was art curation.
“The thing about curating is people don’t realize there is a lot that goes into it other than the creative aspect,” she said. “There are a lot of other moving parts that are just business and logistics, when it comes to curating on a daily basis, like writing a lot of emails and corresponding with a lot of different people. And writing a lot. I think that’s one big part of curating that I specifically think that I enjoy.”
Per a 2017 report commissioned by the American Alliance of Museums, 93 percent of museum directors, 92.6 percent of museum chairs and 89.3 percent of board members are white. While the art world and museums are historically dominated by white people, Patterson-West understands that her existence within such a space stands as a testament to the new gatekeepers of Western art. 
“On the day to day, I try not to focus on [that], just because it can affect my work, if I let my mind get bogged down with those kinds of great societal issues,” she said. “I try to keep my focus on the art and the different ways I can make a change.”
Yet, the absence of black women in the art world was never something she could fully ignore.  
She found that immersing herself within the art world reminded her of her childhood, when she would walk through galleries and stare up in awe at the paintings. Except this time, she realized the world depicted within those paintings was of a white world — one which erased and ignored the existence of black people.
This realizaton inspired her to specialize her curatorial interests to work by black artists who comprise that missing narrative. She created Modern Black Contemporary, a blog that features artwork for and by members of the African diaspora.
“I came across Kimberly Drew’s popular blog ‘Black Contemporary Art,’ and that was at a time when I was like, ‘OK, what can I do to sort of make a concept like this my own?’” Patterson-West said. “I decided to create my own Tumblr blog to have my own discourse about what is being left out.”
On social media, she follows fellow black women art curators, including Drew, who was once the social media manager for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Thelma Golden, who is the director and chief curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem. From each, she not only seeks inspiration but also to learn from those who are currently working in the field she wishes to one day enter. 
The New York Times’ article “With New Urgency, Museums Cultivate Curators of Color,” revealed the percentage of curators at the biggest museums in the country who identity as people of color, with LACMA near the top at 36 percent, and the MET at the bottom with only 11 percent. In 2015, a study by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation found that only 16 percent of leadership positions within museums are held by people of color; within the roles of museum curators, leaders, conservators and educators, only 4 percent were African American. 
“It is difficult to look around and see no one that looks like you,” Patterson-West said. “But I do, on the other hand, want to say that social media has increased accessibility to art in a way that no one could have expected.”
She credits social media with breaking down class barriers and allowing those from low-and middle-class backgrounds to join the art conversation they were once barred from. Platforms such as Instagram and Tumblr have allowed minority artists to promote and exhibit their work, while finding a place for themselves in the art world.
“When you get a group of people who have been excluded for so long … [and] pair that raw passion with an eye for beautiful images and also just a desire for change and attention to social justice and accessibility, you really just get a lot of trails being blazed,” she said. 
Aside from art history, Patterson-West also studies French, and hopes to learn more about contemporary French art. Next semester, she will study abroad in Paris — a place she has always admired due to its historical relevance to various black artists. 
“I’m definitely looking forward to having those museums at my disposal, even though they have very troubled histories,” she said.
But Paris is not the only place Patterson-West wants to experience. 
She said she hopes to travel the world and work in places where there is a greater need for black curators, slowly integrating African artistic expression into the narrative of Western history. Art is a testament to its time, a way to document the presence of a particular culture within the world, Patterson-West said. Without a footprint, many may remain unaware that black art even exists. 
Even Patterson-West herself admits that she didn’t know there was such a thing as black contemporary art until she went on the internet. This summer, she is set to work at LACMA full-time and write for the museum’s blog, “Unframed.” She will also engage with the museum’s permanent collection and will be given the opportunity to practice creating her own exhibition for the museum. 
“[The future is] going to involve a lot more artists of color and queer artists and women artists,” she said. “I think it’s going to be beautiful.”
This story is part of the Daily Trojan’s special coverage for Black History Month. It will run periodically throughout February.

I walked into the Eso Won bookstore early Monday morning in search of a book about love. It was the first day in a long time that rain wasn’t flooding the streets of Los Angeles, and the warm laughter of older black women was filled the otherwise quiet Leimert Park.
Eso Won Books is a tiny store, hidden between two other businesses and noticeable only by its large red lettering that stands out against the yellow storefront. It has been here for decades, ever since owner James Fugate moved to Los Angeles from Detroit. He wanted to create an independent space for black writers who are often shunned from mainstream bookstores.  
Here, every month is Black History Month. 
The bookstore has been cherished by the likes of Michelle Obama and award-winning author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who once called it his favorite bookstore in the world. It’s located in the center of Leimert Park, which is dubbed the contemporary hub of African American art in Los Angeles, despite the rapidly changing demographics of the surrounding South L.A. area. 
“Eso Won is one among a long tradition of black bookstores that sprang up to water [my] roots,” Coates said in an interview with The New York Times. “In much the same way we need diversity among authors and editors, we need diversity among the ranks of booksellers. They are the ultimate arbiters of our literary tradition.”
Over the years, the bookstore has become a haven for black writers so they can always count on their work being appreciated by someone, somewhere.
On that day, I was that someone.
The bookstore was empty that morning, and I spent nearly an hour wandering through the aisles, carefully analyzing each book to find the novel that would make my heart flutter and spark a fire in my soul, or, in Coates’ terms, “water [my] roots.” Eventually, I stumbled upon a book about love but not about romance: “Women’s Voices of West Africa,” an anthology of songs and poems written by West African women.
In the book, songs and poems from West African traditions are used to convey the emotions and sentiments of common experiences such as love, marriage and death. There is a love of community, a love of culture, a love of self and family conveyed through each verse, but there are also the stories of heartache, pain and worry. It’s hard to hear the tunes just by reading the words on the page, but I imagine that they are sung with the deep, soulful, belting tunes the way Nina Simone sings “Sinnerman” or maybe the way Aretha Franklin sings “I Say a Little Prayer.” African American music is rooted in the beats, verses and tunes that were brought enslaved by Africans, but these beats, verses and tunes have since burgeoned into their own culture through gospel songs, soul songs, hip-hop and rap. The traces of our ancestral roots in music are still very present but, simultaneously, so very distant from the continent they originated from. 
Perhaps I picked up this book to only glimpse a culture which once ran through my blood —  having traced my roots back to a slave port in Dakar, Senegal, I wonder over the years about the person I would be, if I were more heavily rooted in the culture of my ancestors, whoever they were.
I think of James Baldwin, who, in “Notes of a Native Son,” spoke about the feelings African Americans have when they come across the Africans who are still in tune with the homeland. For many black Americans, Africa is less of a homeland and more a place we learn about through history in school. It is a part of the larger internal struggle we face, as we must come to accept that our thoughts and traditions are Western, and our culture, though unique and identifiably our own, is still American. The color of our skin does not change that. 
“The African before him has endured privation, injustice, medieval cruelty,” Baldwin wrote. “But the African has not yet endured the utter alienation of himself from his people and his past … They face each other, the Negro and the African, over a gulf of 300  — an alienation too vast to be conquered in an evening’s good will.” 
An alienation too vast to be conquered in a Monday morning’s good will. 
I picked up the West African song book, and I was only given about 200 pages to imagine that I could come from any country in Africa (and that I could sing any song in the book) because as far as I know, it is possible that one of these nations listed was, hundreds of years ago, home to my ancestors.
The book approaches the use of verbal art as a form of expression, as a way to orally preserve traditions. Women have always used such methods to express themselves, though movement of such spoken expressions were often limited due to language barriers and a lack of written words. Today, both written and oral forms co-exist, but, according to the book, singing is still the primary way women choose to express themselves.
The book states that Songhai people (stylized in the book as Songhoy) live along the Niger River —  stretching from Niger, Mali, to northwestern Nigeria and northern Benin. Though these countries have faced long, harrowing histories of French and British colonization, the book still aims to highlight the customary songs that are passed down the same way, I assume, Negro spirituals were passed down to me. 
For the Songhai and the Zarma (who live primarily on the West bank of the Niger River, from Northern Benin to the Southern Mali Border), Zamu poems are sung and sometimes relay themes of love and courtship.
 “Last year this time I was a sweet potato,” expresses one song about a woman who has fallen in love with a well-off man she will never be with. “Last year this time I was a talhana [a plant that blooms year-round] / last year this time I was a nîme [drought-resistant tree] … / This year I have only rags to tie around my waste.”
In a song by Hausa performer Zabiya Uwani Zakirai  (the Hausa are the largest ethnic group in Africa, primarily based in Niger and Nigeria), she expresses emotional heartache after she and her lover seperate. 
“I remember the day of our farewell / On the open space where we used to play,” she sings. “And for seven days, I have not been able to sleep / I have been thinking about love.”
It took me an hour to stumble across this anthology at Eso Won Books, and I bought it, along with an archive collection of New Yorker stories from the 1960s, which included Baldwin’s famous “Letter from a Region in my Mind” story and the magazine’s significant coverage of the Civil Rights Movement. I thought, as I left the store, that the traditions that are passed down in our cultures are still sisters, even if their paths no longer intersect. There lies the importance of black-owned business such as Eso Won Books, that understand the importance and value of bringing African and black American worlds together.

Located next to the Starbucks in USC Village, Fruit+Candy is the latest retail store to arrive at the University’s mixed-use complex. F+C is replacing SOKFY, a surf lifestyle store that opened and closed in 2018. Despite what its name may suggest, F+C is not a one-stop shop for sweets and fresh produce — it’s actually a clothing and beauty store. 
Manager John Kim, whose parents own the store, said the name was inspired by his childhood experiences of growing up eating plenty of healthy foods while still having a significant sweet tooth. Kim said pairing the two foods was the perfect fit for the store because of its fun wordplay and strong brand identity.
F+C specializes in selling a blend of affordable, high-fashion clothing and creative Korean beauty products. And in an homage to the store’s name, it does offer gourmet Sugarfina candy. The store is brightly lit and provides a colorful ambiance for customers to explore the wide variety of product displays. Through the diversity of the goods it offers, F+C hopes to accumulate a large following of loyal USC customers. 
“Having a stale set of products that don’t change, which might bore customers after our initial opening is what we want to avoid,” Kim said. 
Kim said he knew that traditional marketing and products would fail to appeal to students. 
“[Our goal is to] create a fashion forward and experiential store that we can curate seasonally with changing items so that students can stay engaged and excited to come in on a consistent basis,” Kim said,  
Although the store is relatively new, Fruit + Candy has already grabbed the attention of students passing through USC Village or grabbing a quick bite at Starbucks. This past weekend, sophomore Wylker Tavares, who is majoring in psychology, was attracted by the colorful sign. Since he was in need for a new jacket,  he decided to browse the new store. 
“When walking into the store, I got a very calming vibe; nothing too out-there,” Tavares said. “The employees seemed nice and very cooperative, and the styles of clothing seemed to be a well-thought out blend of preppy and modern casual clothing.” 
Tavares also found that the strategy of placing Sugarfina candy next to the exit of the store was effective to grab customers’ attention on their way out. 
“It was a good concept to have the candy displayed near the entrance because it could entice those leaving after a purchase to go ahead and buy some,” Tavares said. 
The decision to specifically sell Sugarfina candy stems from Kim’s belief that the luxury candy brand perfectly complements F+C’s aesthetic, which he describes as “bright, colorful and fun.” 
Along with a colorful and appealing aesthetic, the manager hopes that the store can provide a warm, welcoming and enjoyable experience for students while also allowing them to engage with the store itself.
“Students are the main focus in a place like this, and it is our responsibility to make sure that we can help them feel heard,” Kim said. 
Through its devotion to Trojan clientele, paired with its eclectic mix of Korean sheet masks, comfy turtlenecks and champagne gummies, F+C hopes to cement its spot in the minds of students and become a staple at USC Village.

USC Information Technology Services recently updated MyUSC to allow students to add their preferred names, pronouns and gender identity to the central USC Student Information System. The new change makes the lives of international students immensely easier, since many of them use alternative names because their first names are difficult to pronounce or remember. 
It can be tough for students with phonetically challenging names to tolerate mispronunciations. And when students go by alternative names, professors may have difficulty matching the new names to their legal names listed on the roster, paired with photos of the students. Allowing students to change their first name gives them more freedom and reflects the University’s empathy for students of different backgrounds and cultures.
“I think [the name change] is really convenient for me because when I go through the [Engemann Student] Health Center or when I was called [on] in class in the past, they always pronounced my Chinese name, but I think it’s hard to pronounce and I feel weird when they [mis]pronounce my name,” said Serena Wang, a freshman majoring in communication.
The opportunity to update English first names on the profile makes it easier for international students both in their personal and academic lives. International students no longer need to spell out their first name each time they visit the student health center, or go by an alternative name when picking up food or coffee. 
In academia, professors often remember international students’ English names more immediately because they are already displayed officially in the system. Keeping a close and stable academic relationship with professors is important for international students’ academic success due to cultural and language barriers, which  can cause them to require more personal attention from instructors. 
Adding one’s preferred name on myUSC can offer international students a much-needed sense of coherence and consistency. 
However, changing one’s first name can affect students’ identities, since first names are often a representation of international students’ nationalities. While this may be the case, the freedom to choose is often much more important to students. 
Chinese international students often differentiate themselves from their Chinese American peers by using their Chinese first names, as it is an obvious indicator of where they are from. Adding an English name to their documentation and student accounts can serve to “disguise” their original nationalities. This can be both useful and inconvenient for students, depending on their priorities and preferences. However, this new system allows students to change their names in the case that their preferences change.
Allowing students to change their preferred first name is not only beneficial to international students but also to trans or non-binary individuals who want to be referred to by a gender neutral name. The myUSC program is taking strides in a more inclusive direction and hopefully other University systems will follow suit.

With the 2019 Undergraduate Student Government elections behind us, I found myself wondering why the topic of controversial, often unabashedly racist, sexist speakers coming to the University has been so consistently salient. There’s little debate to be had: We, the student body, have no obligation to pay for or give any speaker a platform on our campus — especially when many of us, as women, students of color and members of the LGBTQ community, are directly marginalized by the rhetoric of some proposed speakers.
But, however simple this discussion should be, it remains overly complicated by the self-victimization of many conservative students and the mainstream media that enables them. Today’s free speech debate centers around the college campus as a mythic, liberal echo chamber; this is, of course, a contrived conservative fantasy that almost any female, LGBTQ or minority college student could quite easily tell you does not exist. The myth functions under the pretense that the First Amendment guarantees the right to resources and a platform, and, further, the right to resources and a platform to spew bigotry, when all it guarantees is freedom from censorship by the state.
The current framing of the campus free speech debate marginalizes vastly more important issues of campus speech. Chief among them are the persistent, targeted harassment of many students on the basis of race, gender identity, orientation and religion that remains rampant on and off college campuses. In nine U.S. metropolitan areas — including the USC area — hate crimes targeting immigrants, people of color and Muslim populations rose by almost 25 percent between 2015 and 2016 alone, according to research published by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
These acts of hatred expose power dynamics inherent to conservatives’ beloved “marketplace of ideas,” where all ideas, from revolutionary eco-socialist, feminist liberation to pro-ethnic cleansing theory, can supposedly compete at an equal level. But in a patriarchal landscape where credibility is monopolized by white men who maintain a dominant grip on platforms, resources and social capital as birthright, this idealized marketplace simply does not exist.
Let me be clear: There is no “equal footing” in a marketplace of ideas that creates any space for violent, bigoted ideologies. When women are directly targeted by crude theories about whether rape is real, or eugenists defend white supremacy, it’s simply impossible to expect us to to speak up and share our ideas publicly — at least not with the same feelings of safety and detachment as white males.
Let’s also be clear about the modern role of the internet and social media in today’s dialogue around free speech: This is now where the bulk of speech happens. Half of all girls in the United Kingdom report experiencing harassment on the internet, according to a 2017 survey by the children’s charity Plan International UK. In 2013, the International Women’s Media Foundation reported 46 percent of women journalists have reported that they have experienced sexual harassment, including rape and death threats, merely for doing their job. 
Unequal access to the internet due to targeted, identity-based harassment is not accidental. It’s a direct reproduction of the real life white, cisgender-heterosexual patriarchy, as well as notions of whose voice and existence carry value and whose do not.
We, as students, are forced to pour endless emotional labor into ignorant debates about whether racist, sexist white men are oppressed when denied guaranteed platforms on college campuses. This is energy and emotional labor we could, and absolutely should, invest into keeping marginalized people safe from harassment and violence and use to uplift their voices. It’s incumbent on all of us to demand discussions about student government and campus life that have real impact on our lives, rather than fictitious, conservative fantasy.
