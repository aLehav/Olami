USC suffered its fifth straight loss with a 57-46 defeat by Arizona on Sunday. The Trojans were primed to take on the Wildcats at the Galen Center, hoping to upset the then 10-5 conference rival. Last season, USC upset the then-top-ranked Wildcats. History, however, did not repeat itself. The loss pushed the Trojans to a 5-12 overall record. USC has yet to win a conference game this season.

In the first half, USC shot 21 percent from the field and did not make a single free throw out of seven attempts. Arizona led by 20 points with just seconds remaining in the first half.
It did not get any prettier for the Trojans in the second half. USC shot 38 percent from the field and sophomore guard Maurice Jones was the only player to execute a 3-pointer.
“We played pretty well defensively” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We shot 29 percent, 6 percent at the 3-point line and that’s not going to beat anybody, anywhere, anytime. We’re just not making shots and we haven’t been for most of the year.”
O’Neill isn’t the only one bewildered by the team’s lack of efficiency.
“I don’t have an answer for it,” freshman guard Byron Wesley said. “We are shooting in the gym everyday but we just keep missing these shots. I think eventually we are going to come out and start making these shots.”
Wesley totaled eight points, seven rebounds, one assist and one steal against the Wildcats.
“We know we have what it takes on defense,” Wesley said. “We know that once we get rolling on offense, we should be a better team.”
USC forced 17 turnovers and allowed only nine in its duel on Sunday.
Along with Wesley, Jones and freshman Alexis Moore played the bulk of the minutes for the Trojans. Jones led the team in scoring with 14 points and also added three steals. Alexis Moore posted two points, four rebounds, five assists and two steals.
O’Neill said with time the team has and will continue to improve.
“These guys will end up having a lot of success” O’Neill said. “Alexis, Dewayne, Byron and Maurice are all good players. They are in roles that they cannot handle right now so they’re a little overwhelmed.”
O’Neill plans to utilize the extra time before their game on Sunday to work on individual improvements with the team.
“We’re going to make individual improvements because we have so many young guys,”O’Neill said. “We want to make sure that guys are getting all kinds of shots every single day.”
The Trojans have one week off before hosting crosstown rival UCLA on Sunday. It will be the first of a two game series this season between both schools. UCLA has won seven of its last nine games with its most recent victories over Arizona and Arizona State.
USC will face UCLA on Sunday, Jan. 15 at 6 p.m. The game will be televised on FOX Sports Net.

On Jan.12, 2010, USC announced Lane Kiffin as the head coach of the USC football program.
The decision left some scratching their heads. Sure, Kiffin had previously been involved with the football team serving under then-head coach Pete Carroll. Most Trojan fans, however, questioned Kiffin’s ability to handle a top football program like USC.
After leaving USC following the 2006 season, Kiffin sought greener pastures in the NFL. Hired as the head coach of the Oakland Raiders in 2007, Kiffin led the team to a disastrous 4-12 season. Kiffin’s sophomore season seemed just as lackluster, only winning one of four games before his dismissal as head coach.
Kiffin returned to college football as head coach for the Tennessee Volunteers. In 2009, the Volunteers finished 7-6 and suffered a devastating loss in the Chik-Fil-A Bowl game against Virginia Tech.
Kiffin parted ways with Tennessee in early 2010 and packed his bags to return to USC. This time, Kiffin would be in charge. Of course, controversy plagued the arrival of Kiffin because of the surfacing of allegations stemming from his time at Tennessee.
Two seasons later, Kiffin has since proven the critics wrong during his time as head coach.
In his inaugural season, Kiffin led the Trojans to an 8-5 season, in which two of the five losses were due to last-minute field goals. Kiffin also became the first coach since Jess Hill, in 1951, to start the season 4-0, in his first season as head coach. Under Kiffin, the Trojans improved greatly from the 2009 season and averaged six yards per play.
In 2011, Kiffin led the Trojans to a 10-2 season, and a monumental victory over the Oregon Ducks, one of the top teams in the country. USC, the outright winner of the south division in the Pac-12 conference, was primed to compete with the Ducks once more had it not been for the two-year postseason ban, handed down by the NCAA from violations committed during the previous coaching era.
The Trojans averaged 294.2 passing yards and 162.6 rushing yards per game, proving that the Trojans are back on top of the college football elite.
2012 begins a new era for USC football.
No longer prohibited from postseason play, Kiffin has the opportunity to potentially play for the Pac-12 conference championship and the 2013 national championship.
Kiffin has an arsenal of returning players for the 2012 season, including many incoming top recruits.
Of the four juniors eligible for the NFL draft, only two, offensive tackle Matt Kalil and defensive end Nick Perry, opted to go pro. Quarterback Matt Barkley and safety T.J. McDonald chose to return for their senior seasons. Both players had outstanding seasons in 2011, earning numerous awards and accolades, encouraging fans to think of what is to come in 2012.
With Barkley and McDonald returning, the notion of the 2013 national championship and the imminent rise of the Kiffin dynasty is not too far-fetched.
The arrival of Kiffin has recharged the Trojan fan base, setting their sights on postseason play for the first time in two years and the possibility of a trip to Miami in 2013.
With all the right pieces of the puzzle intact, only time will tell if Kiffin’s visor will be gold plated or thrown away.
 
Andie Hagemann is a senior majoring in communication. Her column “Armchair Quarterback” runs Tuesdays. 
Of course, it helps to have MB7 at quarterback, but Kiffin has done a great job so far.  Fight on!

Serving the second year of a two-year postseason ban, No. 5 USC did not participate in a bowl game last month but notched a big victory nonetheless.
Lucky number seven · Juniors TJ McDonald and Matt Barkley exiting the tunnel at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Both Barkley and McDonald have decided to forgo the 2012 NFL draft held in April. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
In front of a modest crowd of reporters and fans at Heritage Hall on Dec. 22, junior quarterback and Newport Beach, Calif. native Matt Barkley announced he would return to school for his senior season, bypassing the chance to participate in  the 2012 NFL draft.
“It is my dream to play [as a] quarterback in the NFL and I intend to make that dream a reality,” Barkley said at the press conference. “But I also know in my heart I have not yet finished my journey as a Trojan football player.”
Throwing for 3,528 yards and 39 touchdown passes in his third season as the Trojans’ starter under center, Barkley was projected to be selected in the first round, possibly even in the top 10. But the chance to potentially earn a BCS National Championship or play in a bowl game for the first time since his freshman season appeared to be too much for Barkley to pass up.
“Our football team has been through some tough times and we have persevered,” Barkley said. “I am not postponing my dream and objective of playing in the NFL so I can just have one more year of college life. I am staying because I want to finish what I started.”
Because of NCAA sanctions levied against the program in June 2010, stemming from the ineligibility of former tailback Reggie Bush during the 2004 and 2005 season, Barkley and his teammates have been unable to participate in postseason play despite compiling 18 wins over the course of the last two seasons. In 2012, however, the Trojans will be able to compete in the Pac-12 championship game and a bowl game.
Also in attendance at the December press conference were USC Athletic Director Pat Haden, USC football coach Lane Kiffin and Barkley’s family, who helped counsel the signal caller throughout his decision-making process.
“This is a special, special college student-athlete story,” Kiffin said. “Matt Barkley decided to come back and get his degree. He decided to come back to start on his master’s program.”
Barkley’s decision came just one day after junior safety T.J. McDonald announced he would also return to school for his season.
McDonald was a first-team All-Pac-12 selection in 2011 and had been projected as a possible second round pick had he decided to declare for the NFL draft.
“We have an opportunity to do something great,” McDonald said in a video released by the school. “That opportunity doesn’t come around very often. I want to finish things out and be a part of something great.”
A second-year starter for the Trojans last season, McDonald finished with 67 tackles and three interceptions, making the Sporting News and Pro Football Weekly All-American first teams. McDonald and his father, Tim, became the first father-son tandem in school history to be named All-Americans. Tim McDonald was an All-American for USC in 1985 and 1986 before a 13-year NFL career with the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers.
In 2010, T.J. McDonald also led the team in tackles with 89.
“We’re obviously very excited about T.J.’s decision to return next year,” Kiffin said in a statement. “He’ll be a leading candidate for the Thorpe Award in 2012 and he has a chance to be a two-time All-American.”
Not every draft-eligible junior  however, will return to USC.
Fellow juniors offensive tackle Matt Kalil and defensive end Nick Perry announced their intentions to declare for the NFL draft instead, but the Trojans are still expected to return 17 of 22 starters, including Barkley, who finished sixth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy last season.
Many analysts have suggested that the Trojans will be ranked in the preseason top five when the rankings are released this summer.
Saw this over at fetchheadlines.com.  I’ll be glad to see him back in a Trojan uniform…he made the right choice.  It doesn’t matter if a guy goes in the top ten, or in the fifth round.  He’ll be just as talented no matter when he’s selected.

The Women of Troy’s run to the national championship came to an abrupt end on Dec. 15 at the Final Four in San Antonio, Texas, at the hands of the University of Illinois.
Killing it · Senior Alex Jupiter had 32 kills in the Final Four match against the University of Illinois. The Women of Troy lost to the Fighting Illini in five sets, after finishing the season with a 29-5 record overall and winning the Pac-12 conference. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The team did not go down without a fight, however, losing in a grueling five sets to the Illini (32-4). It was USC’s second straight appearance in the national semifinals and seventh overall in the last 12 years.
As was the case throughout the majority of the year, senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter led the way for the Women of Troy, who finished the season with an impressive 29-5 record. USC won the Pac-12 by a three game margin, finishing 20-2 in conference play.
Despite the conference title, UCLA represented the Pac-12 in the national championship game and took down the Illini to win the title.
The Women of Troy generally breezed by their competition in the matches preceding the Final Four. They defeated the University of Oklahoma in four sets, swept Yale University and the University of Tulsa, and defeated the University of Hawaii and Pepperdine to make it to the Final Four in San Antonio.
Jupiter had 32 kills during the contest against Illinois, highlighting a season that saw her win plenty of hardware and honors by the end of the season.
The Paris native won the 2011 Honda Sports Award for women’s volleyball, an award given to the national player of the year. She is the fourth USC player to win the award. Jupiter was also named the American Volleyball Coaches Association player of the year and was a unanimous All-American for the third year in a row.
Despite the efforts of Jupiter, the Illini, led by Colleen Ward, proved to be too much, winning the second, third and final set, ending the Trojan’s dreams of another title trophy.
Though the team figures to be in contention once again next season, they will lose three All-American players upon this year’s graduation. Jupiter, Lauren William and Kendall Bateman have used up their eligibility, leaving major voids at outside hitter, middle blocker and setter, respectively.
Despite the disappointing loss in the Final Four, this was one of the finer seasons in school history, being ranked in the top 10 in the country for the majority of the season. Their only losses during the year were to Penn State, Central Florida, UCLA, Stanford and Illinois.
At one point during the season, the Women of Troy won 12 games in a row, and won 20 out of 21 during that span. USC has won six national championships in the sport, having won their last one in 2003 by beating the University of Florida.
OUR SC Women of Troy volleyball  team & coaches are great.  We had a Super Season.
The loss in the semi leaves a bittersweet taste to the season.
We destroyed ucla in our last conference game at the Wooden center.
Ucla beat the Illini without much struggle.
We had the 2nd set won…up 22-19…and gave up 6 straight points.
We let Illinois off the hook. They won 3rd set.
We fought back gamely and won the 4th.
We led 8-7 in the 5th.
Then we changed sides…and fell flat.
It is SAD for all the wonderful women on the team that we did not get to play ucla for the Trophy.
I just know we would have won.  Unfortunately, the Illini played the match of their lives
against us.
Fight ON,
and now its time to support the Mens Team.
Went down with a fight, are you serious. The team was ranked #1 in the AVCA poll and faltered once again
in the final four for the second consecutive season. They had three – 1st team All-Americans with three seniors leadership to finally win it all. Having ucla claim the title was adding insult to injury who beat Illinois in four while
the women of troy against them went meekly in the fifth set once sides were changed.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report between Wednesday, Jan. 4 and Monday, Jan. 9. 
Crimes against a person
At 12:43 p.m. on Jan. 9, a suspect approached a non-USC female who was standing at a bus stop at 37th Street and Vermont Avenue, asked for the time and forcibly pulled a chain from around her neck. DPS officers on routine patrol happened upon the scene and the suspect was detained after a short pursuit. The suspect was positively identified by the female during a field “show-up,” then he was arrested and transported for booking.
Crimes against property
at 10:24 P.M. on Jan. 4, a suspect pulled off a screen at 1362 30th St., opened an unsecured window and climbed through it to gain entry. The suspect then removed ten steaks, eighteen eggs and a bag.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 1:16 P.M. on Jan. 9, a staff member reported that he observed a suspect loitering on the fire escape outside a laboratory at the Zumberge Hall of Science. When the subject realized that he was being watched, he fled down the fire escape with a second suspect who was inside the lab. DPS officers responded and conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspects. The staff member inspected the lab and stated it did not appear that any property had been removed.
at 12:11 P.M. on Jan. 9, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect sleeping on the ground in front of the United University Church and detained her for investigation. The officers advised the suspect against trespassing on university property, then she was escorted off campus and released.
At 3:28 p.m. on Jan. 5, DPS officers responded to a non-USC male who fell out of his wheelchair inside the Keck Hospital parking building. The male was not injured and LAFD Unit #16 was at the scene assisting him into his vehicle when the officers arrived. The male then drove away without further incident.
At 10:18 p.m. on Jan. 4, a student was cited to Judicial Affairs at 27th and Hoover streets for uncooperative and belligerent behavior with DPS officers who detained him for questioning after he was observed behaving suspiciously.
At 4:28 p.m. on Jan. 4, a non-USC male entered the lobby of Keck Medical Hospital of USC and began screaming that he had been stabbed. A Rapid Response Team responded to the scene and found no injuries to the male, but he was suffering from an unidentified medical problem. The male was then transported to Alhambra Hospital for medical treatment.
At 2:38 p.m. on Jan. 4, DPS officers responded to a fire alarm activation in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center due to smoke from a lit cooking fuel cannister that was discarded in a trash can. The fuel was extinguished and properly disposed of by Fire Safety personnel who also responded to the scene. They reset the alarm and cleared the building for reentry.

The Gould School of Law had the highest pass rate for graduates taking the July California Bar Exam for the first time out of all law schools in the  state, according to statistics posted this week.
Of alumni taking the test for the first time, 91 percent passed. This compares with an 89 percent pass rate for graduates of Stanford Law School and an 87 percent pass rate for U.C. Berkeley’s Law School graduates.
Kate Mock | Daily Trojan
Of all first-time takers, 69.4 percent passed the bar exam.
“For the last three or four years the top three schools have been us, Stanford and Berkeley,” Gould Dean Robert K. Rasmussen said. “This year was just our turn to lead the pack.”
Students do not specifically prepare to pass the California Bar Exam in the vast majority of their classes, Rasmussen said.
“Our goal is to encourage our students to think rigorously, be innovative and effectively communicate,” Rasmussen  said. “It turns out that those skills translate very well toward excelling on the California Bar Exam.”
Rasmussen said the class of 2011 represented its alma mater well.
“I’m very proud of the accomplishments of our students,” Rasmussen said. “They were a great group of students and are a great group of alumni.”

As a residential senator candidate last semester, he received the highest number of votes without getting a position. Tyagi was asked to fill the position during the first week of November.
“I felt taken aback,” Tyagi said. “I was shocked and also very excited.”
According to USG Vice President Logan Lachman, senators are rarely inducted at semester breaks. Senators are usually sworn in at the end of the academic year after they are elected.
USG President Monish Tyagi, who is not related to Keshav Tyagi, said changes in officials more often occur in the cabinet, whose members are appointed by the president, but replacing the higher position of senator is not unheard of.
“People who run for Senate know it’s for the full year, but students’ circumstances change,” Monish Tyagi said.
As a residential senator, the sophomore will act as a spokesperson for students who are not affiliated with a Greek organization and who live in the immediate area of USC. According to Lachman, who runs Senate meetings as vice president, Senators must attend meetings of different clubs and organizations registered with USG, attend Senate meetings, write resolutions, work on legislation and advocate for their constituency.
“It’s one of the more strenuous jobs,” Lachman said. “There are a lot of extra hours.”
To prepare for this new position, Keshav Tyagi said he shadowed Deng for about a week.
The incoming senator said he would like to advocate for transgender students by making bathrooms for transgender students more easily accessible and making services for transgender students more available and accessible.
“I would like to focus on transgender awareness and transgender acceptance on campus,” Keshav Tyagi said. “I want the university to integrate transgender friendly policies and to increase awareness because that’s still an area that really needs to be improved.”
Tyagi is also involved in the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, the InterVarsity Trojan Christian Fellowship, serves as a peer health educator and works as a multimedia assistant in the music school. He said he looks forward to bringing a new outlook to USG because of these experiences.
“I’m hoping that I can bring a different voice to the Senate. I feel like I’m lucky to not have had to do it first semester because I was able to get more immersed in USC and gain a new perspective,” Keshav Tyagi said.

Richard Saul Wurman, the creator of the Technology, Entertainment and Design conferences, will speak at USC this morning as part of a Visions and Voices: The Arts and Humanities Initiative event to discuss his new venture examining the art of improvised conversation and intellectual jazz.
Wurman’s project, titled WWW.WWW, will gather some of the world’s most influential thinkers, take them to a secret location and randomly pair them for impromptu conversations onstage while the audience analyzes their discussions.
Among those expected to attend are internationally acclaimed architect Frank Gehry and Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington.
Wurman describes the new conference as a “top drawer” exclusive event saturated with creativity and innovation.
“I am only interested in absolute excellence,” Wurman said. “The conference is intense, intellectually jaw-breaking and there are no speeches or presentations.”
Wurman is also developing a tablet application that will allow users to view the WWW.WWW conference and interact with one another via Twitter.
An author of 81 books on a variety of topics, Wurman has explored everything from social media and health care, to music and architectural design. Wurman created the TED conferences in 1984 to analyze the interplay between a variety of concepts.
Several cities, communities and universities around the world, including USC, have begun hosting TEDx conferences in recent years to engage people in innovative thinking. TEDx conferences, which can be hosted by cities, universities or any other type of community, are organized independently, but must follow certain rules to be granted a license to use the TED name. The fourth TEDxUSC conference will be held in May.
“TED conferences are so amazing,” said Mina Chow, a part-time lecturer in the school of architecture and a friend of Wurman. “The time just flies and students learn about innovation, a life-changing, ground-breaking and absolutely original process.”
Inspired by TED, Chow is currently working on bridging architecture with cinema to create a 3-D project.
“I’m using technological breakthroughs to present architectural design in an entertaining way and that is just one example of what TED stands for,” Chow said. “That’s what is so amazing about these conferences: One moment I’m having an intellectual epiphany and the next I’m dancing with my students to reggae on stage.”
Wurman said TED conferences exhibit none of the usual traits people associate with conferences.
“There’s no podiums, no panels, no speeches,” Wurman said. “It’s an eclectic meeting featuring everything from animal acts to the first Macintosh.”
TED conferences have featured speakers as diverse as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and televangelist Billy Graham.
“It is important to recognize the interaction of so many things,” Wurman said. “For example, social media spurred revolutions in the Middle East. There is an interconnection between all things, but in school it’s not taught that way.”

After more than one year as a colony, or probationary chapter, Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity received its official charter last month, making the organization eligible to hold its first official new member recruitment Jan. 16.
It’s official · Former Phi Sigma Kappa president Mike Fritschner spoke when the fraternity received its chapter charter in December. - Courtesy of Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity
The fraternity returned to USC as a colony in fall 2010 after losing its charter in 2003 for disciplinary reasons. As part of a fully chartered fraternity, members now have all the privileges of initiated brothers and the ability to associate with the national fraternity.
Phi Sigma Kappa will move to The Row next fall into the house it occupied in 2003, when its charter was revoked.
Demetrius Wallace, director of membership development with the national fraternity, kickstarted in fall 2010 the efforts to bring a chapter back to USC.
Wallace said he recruited the initial members and introduced them to the organization. The members then had to fulfill a variety of requirements before the national fraternity would recognize them.
“They logged over 1,000 hours of service last year before they turned in their petition and they had raised over $5,000 for different philanthropies like Swim with Mike,” Wallace said. “We look for them to do things that a chapter can do and we like to see that they can pull them off.”
Members said showing the national fraternity they deserved a national charter required hard work.
“You need a lot of persistence in the same sense as someone starting a company from nothing, and this can be even harder than that because what you are selling is social opportunities,” Phi Sig President Matthew Redhead said. “The big thing is telling people that you are creating a networking group and a group of friends that you will know for the rest of your life. … A lot of people think of a fraternity as just partying a lot, but it’s more than that.”
Former president Mike Fritschner said the initial stages were difficult, but that the members’ motivation to make a difference helped them get through the chartering process.
“We decided that this is what we want to do,” Fritschner said. “This is a great opportunity and a great group of guys and we jumped on the opportunity to have an impact on USC’s campus.”
Members said they were happy to see the fraternity expand to have more than 60 brothers.
“It meant a lot to me because I was there at the beginning,” said Phi Sig member Jonathan Oliva, a sophomore majoring in political science. “I have been able to see this fraternity grow, to reflect upon the journey toward our chartering and officially achieve our goal in December.”
Now that Phi Sig has received its charter, members said they look forward to focusing more on the future of their fraternity.
Fritschner said he expects that the fraternity will do more philanthropy work and become more active in the community.
“When I became president, my main goal was to become chartered,” Fritschner said. “But moving forward, I want to spread the impact my fraternity has had on us through USC and the broader Los Angeles area.”
“It’s always fare weather, boys, when the Phi Sigs come back home!”
Look out Pike, you won’t be #1 much longer!

To whom it may concern: I regret to inform you the employment rates and salaries of recent graduates have dropped significantly in the past few years.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Approximately half of recent graduates have jobs that require a college degree, a quarter of recent graduates have taken jobs that do not require a college degree, and the last quarter can’t even land a job, according to Catherine Rampell of the New York Times.
This spring, thousands of students across the country will graduate and find themselves entering the real world — as many of us call it — only to be welcomed by poor job prospects and burdensome debt.
The only questions left to ask are simple: What can students do to line up jobs, and what can educational institutions do for imminent alumni to ease the transition?
You will find that experience is a requirement in almost every single application you fill out. Two to five years experience in this, five to 10 years experience in that. I have even seen postings with ridiculous requirements of 10 to 15 years experience. Lessons in the classroom will never amount to lessons learned through empiricism.
Networking and experience are the essential ingredients to gaining an upper hand on the person sitting next to you at an interview. I was lucky enough to get my job through a referral by a friend that I met while networking.
Accordingly, the first thing universities should focus their attention on is networking and experience-based opportunities for students: internships, externships, apprenticeship, assistant researching and volunteering.
Fortunately, USC offers many opportunities. Unfortunately, the opportunities are not always well advertised. Students tend to find out about them hours before they take place; they have little time to do the kind of research that’s necessary for effective networking.
Even worse, these job fairs take place during the busiest times of the day. Noon is when students rush toward the Campus Center for a quick fix before the next lecture begins. Many students do not have enough time to present themselves properly in front of potential employers.
To get around that issue, some students — including myself — have resorted to cutting class to visit a job fair. But heed my warning: Do not skip a three-hour, once-a-week lecture. I returned the following week to find out I missed the crux of the course and a pop quiz.
USC should consider allowing students to keep their work-study jobs on campus for a set time after graduation. This system would benefit students worried about paying off student debt while searching frantically for any place that will take them.
The amount of debt students accumulate is rising, only making the search for a well-paying job more urgent. In October 2011, USA Today released an article stating that student loans had totaled more than $1 trillion, and students borrowed more than $100 billion in 2011.
It is in the best interest of higher education institutions to develop programs to minimize the arduous transition into the job market. Happy graduates with financial security are more likely to thank their alma maters than those struggling to pay for sustenance.
As stressful as it sounds, my only suggestion to students early in their college careers is to submerge themselves into programs where they are forced to meet people.
I know many unemployed people who I consider to be outstanding individuals, who have had to accept the first job offer they received, often resulting in relocation because of consequences beyond their control. Do what you can — while remaining ethical — to gain the advantage over your peers.
As for eager and frustrated seniors like myself, until at least the economy recovers to its pre-recession state, the best thing I suggest is to apply, apply and apply again a few more times.
Rinse, lather, and repeat. It could never hurt to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks.

Here in the UK we have been helping graduates with exactly this issue – moving from the university “bubble” to a career – but historically due to pressures (or simply no idea on career options) at Uni this was not possible for most until AFTER graduation. However, we have noticed a change in the last few years with more forward-thinking first year students looking for ways to build their CV and apply for jobs BEFORE their final exams. With planning and time management it can be done. These well rounded, ready-to-go, super graduates are putting themselves head and shoulders above the majority thus securing employment with the best employers – the bar has most definitely been raised.

Before you stress yourself out about doing better at school and work, remember: A positive mind-set can improve performance on nearly every level — including productivity and creativity.
Congyu E | Daily Trojan
While conducting a study on Harvard undergraduates, Shawn Achor, author of The Happiness Advantage, found that the most successful students were the ones who took care of themselves. Along with working hard, successful students also made time for their hobbies and loved ones.
Students can learn from a trend occurring in the corporate world as executives are moving away from using pressure to motivate their employees and moving toward employee happiness.
I overheard the following conversation in a quarterly operations meeting:
Vice President of Operations: “You’d better straighten out this mess in a hurry.”
General Manager: “I agree. And I would welcome your advice.”
VP: “I prefer pressure.”
Similar scenes play out in businesses all over the world. Many executives believe they will get the best work out of their employees by using fear and intimidation tactics, and corporate cultures vibrate with the results.  It is one of the best-kept, not-so-secret techniques.
This approach to leadership might lead to ulcers, employee burnout and anxiety attacks.
Many people believe that success precedes happiness. They think, “Once I get a promotion, I will be happy.”
Yet, that technique does not work as well as some think.
The January-February 2012 issue of the Harvard Business Review published a series of articles that suggests an alternative approach to management: happiness.
Companies are constantly searching for the next big program that will energize its employees and will stir their creative juices.
Now,  corporate leaders are slowly realizing that if they want a company of winners, they need to treat their people like winners.
Burt’s Bees, a personal-care products company, experienced an enormous change beginning in July 2010 as it began a global expansion. In that kind of do-or-die, high-pressure context, many leaders push, scream and call for more meetings, browbeating everyone in sight.
John Replogle, then-CEO of Burt’s Bees, took what he believed was the high road. Every day Replogle sent at least one email praising a team member for his or her work. He directed his managers to facilitate sessions teaching employees about happiness.
According to the Harvard Business Review article, “Positive Intelligence,” Replogle’s use of happiness, instead of pressure, as his management approach successfully helped the company transition to the global stage.
A recent research study conducted by the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business defined “thriving” people as those who demonstrated 16 percent better overall performance (as reported by their managers) and 125 percent less burnout (self-reported) than their peers. They also missed much less work and got more promotion opportunities than those who are comparatively less happy.
As college students preparing for careers, we should take note of these positive effects occurring in the business world and try to apply them to our lives.  Trends show that if we’re happy, then success will follow.

USC holds plenty of summer programs for high school students. Soon, however, it will be running an actual high school.
USC Hybrid High is the first school in the county to address the community’s high dropout rate with an entirely original approach. The school holds the ambitious goal of graduating 100 percent of its students.
Lener Jimenez | Daily Trojan
Though people might argue against the feasibility and success of the school in directly addressing dropout rates, the school should be praised for its pioneering, targeted plan.
Regardless of how the school performs, its inception serves as an example for other colleges to innovate.
The school’s unique mix of attributes makes it perfectly poised to address students’ needs.
According to the Council for Exceptional Children, many young adults who drop out see themselves as perfectly competent students. The students felt they could have graduated if their schools had supported them properly.
USC Hybrid High seeks to provide that support. Students will receive online coursework that will let them work at their own speed. The school plans to provide digital curricula and online video resources. The school will further accommodate students’ busy lives by offering customized schedules that take students’ outside responsibilities into account.
Along with being sensitive to individual students’ needs, USC Hybrid High will also be mindful of the surrounding community’s demographic. The school’s decision to mirror the USC neighborhood and enroll more than 90 percent Hispanic and African-American students shows it is looking to directly address the community’s needs.
According to the California Department of Education, the high school dropout rate in Los Angeles County in 2010 was 20.3 percent, two percentage points higher than the statewide dropout rate of 18.2 percent. The dropout rates for Hispanic/Latino and African American students, who constitute more than 70 percent of the students in the district, are even higher at 23.1 percent and 31.3 percent, respectively.
One could argue that the school fails to address a handful of deeper and broader issues that tie into dropout rates — race, gender and economics.
Such an argument is justifiable, but it would be an incredibly tall task to design a curriculum and program that targets all those factors at once. It is better to focus on what, realistically, can be solved on such a small scale.
USC Hybrid High isn’t perfect. Though the day-to-day operations of the school will be managed by Ednovate, a non-profit organization launched by USC Rossier School of Education. There is no formal apparatus or evaluation system in place that will examine the school’s true effectiveness in lowering dropout rates.
Furthermore, USC Hybrid High’s technology-focused and custom-tailored model does not emphasize discipline. There is a chance that without the usual rigors of the traditional school week, students will get too caught up in their busy lives to finish their coursework.
It will be impossible to determine the school’s true success until the first class of students graduates. Its approach, however, is still worth trying.
Though USC Hybrid High might not lead to a noticeable or drastic change in dropout statistics for students in inner-city or low-income neighborhood high schools, the school does set a precedent for innovation and should inspire more meaningful collaboration between universities and their surrounding communities.

Though 2011 saw its fair share of extravagant 3-D epics and noisy action flicks, many films that received critical acclaim did so without huge budgets, but through nuance and a keen focus on story and character development.

Critics and audiences have been buzzing about the following pictures as Academy Award contenders. With so many excellent performances and stunning works, it’s next to impossible to provide a comprehensive list, but here are a few of the films you need to see before Oscar night on Feb. 26 — that is, if you intend to win your Oscar pool.
5. Moneyball
Written by the acclaimed Aaron Sorkin, Moneyball is a fast-paced jaunt through the minds of geniuses, using their talent and fierce determination to turn around a failing Oakland A’s team. Brad Pitt, in perhaps his finest acting role to date, plays the baseball team’s general manager, Billy Beane.
Though it is nice to see a superstar like Pitt finally choose the right project to showcase his talents, the true surprise of the film is Jonah Hill. Holding his own against Pitt and other Hollywood greats, such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Hill commands the screen with every piece of dialogue.
Some might find that the film devotes too much time to the complicated baseball scouting system at the heart of the plot, but with the cast’s shining charisma, Moneyball becomes the feel-good sports movie of the year.
4. Margin Call
Perhaps the most underrated film of the year, Margin Call tells the fascinating tale of a Lehman Brothers-like investment firm during a period of 24 hours prior to the financial crisis of 2008.
With an all-star cast, including Paul Bettany, Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Simon Baker, Zachary Quinto and Penn Badgley, Margin Call manages to offer a fascinating and angering look at the infamous financial fiasco.
It is difficult to believe that Margin Call is writer-director J.C. Chandor’s first feature-length film. Taut, riveting and smart — a very difficult combination to pull off — the film allows for just the right amount of character development mixed in with intelligent and dramatic boardroom showdowns, while doing so in a playful manner.
3. Beginners
Christopher Plummer shines in Mike Mills’s dramedy Beginners as a man who comes out as gay more than 40 years after the death of his wife. Ewan McGregor stars as Plummer’s son and the two manage to depict a spellbounding father-son relationship.
The film also stars Mélanie Laurent as an actress with trust issues. When Laurent’s Anna and McGregor’s Oliver meet after the death of his father, a beautifully tortured romance begins.
Mills manages to portray both the highs and lows of life.  The film doesn’t confine itself to specific genres, either — instead, it is a reflection of life as it really occurs.
Portraying a spectrum of experience and emotion, Beginners is not a study of some random character, but rather the character study of all human beings.
2. The Artist 
Heartfelt, funny and moving, the silent film shows Hollywood that character development is more important than flash and pizzazz.
Modern films have forgotten about what makes cinema so mesmerizing. It’s not about special effects and IMAX screens: The best films are about the characters. The Artist allows viewers to identify with these characters, going on an impactful emotional journey alongside them.
Take Jean Dujardin’s performance as George Valentin, for instance. Emotions clearly come across through the look of his eyes and the way his mouth curls, allowing viewers to feel everything that he feels without even uttering a word.
Though The Artist is about the flash and glitz of Hollywood, the film manages to show us that sometimes the simpler the better — or better yet, sometimes things are better left unsaid.
1. The Descendants
The Artist accomplished wonders within its limits and stands apart as one of the best films of the year; however, Alexander Payne’s The Descendants elevates itself as a modern American classic.
George Clooney stars as Matt King, a lawyer in Hawaii who is juggling the chaos of his family life, including his rebellious teenage daughter, Alex, played by Shailene Woodley. Taking the usually hackneyed role of the daughter who rolls her eyes at her parents, Woodley mesmerizes.
The other performances are just as memorable; it is, a near-perfect film. In no other film this year will you find such top-notch performances derived from an incredible script along with superior cinematography.
Though The Artist might show us the majesty of the past, The Descendants serves as an exemplary precedent for the future of cinema.
I really hope Jean Dujardin wins the Best Actor Oscar this year – his performance is just breathtaking, magnetic. Even though George Valentin is self-centered, even salutes his own portrait, he does in such a child-like, innocent way, radiating joy and charisma, that you can’t help but like him and feel for him.  It’s so painful to see his infectious smile fade and pain cross his face that I could hardly breathe. I have never seen anyone acting like that – even though I like Clooney or Pitt, they never touched me like this unknown French actor.
I’m not against the film’s Best Picture Oscar, but I think it’s Dujardin who carries the whole film on his shoulders, without him it would really be just “a nostalgic ode to a bygone era” – but his performance is so poignant and modern it elevates the film above cliches. It’s about a human being who has to realise who insignificant he is, about loneliness and suffering, about a world that forgets and lets down the stars it created.
I really hope the Academy rewards the enormous talent of Dujardin – instead of those who chase the Oscar year after year…

Fans talk, ratings walk.
For network executives this season, the calculation involved in culling a revamped mid-season lineup seemed as simple as that. With the advent of Hulu, Netflix, DVR technology and readily available links to illegally stream shows online, the television industry’s cherished distribution model (“You’re going to sit through these commercials, and you’re going to like it!”) is on its way out. And that has networks worried.
That worry at the executive level translates to a simple dictum for shows’ audiences: Don’t get too attached. The learning curve for new shows is shorter than ever, allowing a show to “find its voice” is quickly becoming a luxury afforded to only the most high-profile debuts, or those with the most money sunk into their pilots.
In the present climate of industry uncertainty and hard-to-define audience tastes, failing to post respectable ratings from the premiere and to hold on to solid numbers in the crucial episodes that follow is usually enough to sign a fledgling show’s death warrant.
Broadcast networks’ unending struggle to identify and to cater to the tastes of a mass market led to two of the most high-profile cancellations of the fall season.
In hopes of riding the wave of retro fever, set in motion by AMC’s awards show juggernaut Mad Men, NBC launched The Playboy Club.  The show missed the mark, and NBC pulled the plug after a catastrophically brief three-episode run.
ABC enjoyed comparatively greater success in capitalizing on audiences’ renewed fascination with the 1960s with the sleek aesthetic of Pan Am.  With the network’s dismal Charlie’s Angels reboot, however, ABC also ended up realizing that nostalgia alone was not a stand-in for real writing or acting. The show’s hasty cancellation appears to suggest that ABC learned its lesson.
At times during the slash-and-burn reshuffling that was the fall season, it seemed as if the better question come springtime would be which new shows would survive the winter hiatus.  Thankfully, there were at least a handful of programs that networks were reluctant to show the door.
For its part, NBC is bringing back two of its freshman comedies, Whitney and Up All Night, but the network will be trying out new nights and time slots for both. Suburgatory and Once Upon A Time, both in their first season, are returning this spring to ABC, and CBS’ widely touted fall releases 2 Broke Girls and A Gifted Man also have places in the network’s mid-season weeknight lineup.
As indicated by NBC’s death-grip on Whitney, networks are increasingly pinning their hopes on shows headed by strong female leads, often — although not always — of the bad girl ilk. ABC currently has two shows awaiting release: Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23 and GCB (allegedly short for ‘Good Christian Belles,’ and not the other B-word), both predominantly filled by mean girls. Krysten Ritter in Apartment 23 verges on sociopathic, while Kristin Chenoweth and company in GCB are the clique-y, catty frenemies you knew from high school — just all grown up with implants and a Texas twang.
And Are You There, Chelsea?, a mid-season launch on NBC starring talk-show host Chelsea Handler, follows as closely in the footsteps of Whitney’s model as it can without being a reboot. FOX’s Zooey Deschanel vehicle, New Girl, had a strong showing in the fall and is definitely returning for the spring. Though the “simply adorkable” lead might not fit the mold, it’s still indicative of a trend toward embracing female leads.
FOX’s supernatural mystery Alcatraz (executive-produced by Lost creator J.J. Abrams) and ABC’s The River, a “found footage” thriller by Paranormal Activity director Oren Peli in the style of The Blair Witch Project, suggest a possible future for big-budget thrillers — if FOX isn’t still gun-shy from the less-than-astronomical success of Terra Nova this past fall.
Discouragingly, broadcast networks seem hell-bent on appealing to the lowest common denominator with some of their spring launches. Earlier this month, ABC unveiled a critically reviled “high-concept comedy” (their words, not mine) about two men, desperate to find work in the female-dominated salesforce, resorting to drag.  This came after the network already debuted one of the most gendered shows in recent memory: Last Man Standing, starring alpha male Tim Allen.
Intent on staying competitive in the race to the bottom, this Thursday CBS is premiering ¡Rob!, a show based on actor Rob Schneider’s real-life experiences marrying into a Mexican family. If I were to find out that writers are now being paid by the cringe instead of by the laugh, I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised.
But things aren’t all bad this spring. Steven Spielberg’s Smash looks to have tremendous entertainment value, and the fare on the premium networks promises to be better than ever.
So don’t cancel your cable or hurl your TV set out the window just yet. This spring has a lot of potential to advance the cause of the inexorable march toward a new golden age of television … or at least keep you entertained until Community comes back on the air.

The eventful, tumultuous career of former English Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would suggest her fierce, strong-willed personality.
Director Phyllida Lloyd’s biopic The Iron Lady, however, centers on a mentally troubled, aging Thatcher (Meryl Streep) battling grief and a barrage of flashbacks from her career. It’s only in her memories that the audience sees her at her prime; in her own reality, Thatcher is lost to the pain of losing her husband and the events that still haunt her.
Political biopic · The Iron Lady describes the tribulations of one of Britain’s most renowed political figures, Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep, right), documenting her struggle to reach her position as well as her family strife. - Photo courtesy of Weinstein Co.
The film opens with a shot of a feeble, old woman reaching out for a pint of milk at the grocery store. Viewers watch her struggle to get to the register so she can ask about the milk’s price. If the viewer doesn’t catch on quickly, the everyday scene comes off as irrelevant.
It’s not until she’s inside the house that it becomes clear this frail woman is Thatcher herself. Lloyd sets up the next few scenes as puzzle pieces to the former prime minister’s situation, from her need to be supervised to her hallucinations of her dead husband Denis (Jim Broadbent).
The film shifts from Thatcher’s reality to her flashbacks often and at seemingly random moments. The execution can become too intricate and tiring, taking the viewers further and further from reality as Thatcher speaks to a non-existent Denis and plummets into another flashback. The scenes are a mixed bag, at times conveying personal insights and at others focusing on political events.
The film then delves into Thatcher’s mental and physical decline, juxtaposing it with the rise and fall of her career as prime minister. With Thatcher being the first female prime minister, the film could have fallen victim to an overly feminist tone, but Lloyd thoughtfully steers clear except when necessary.
At the same time, the small details that Lloyd includes cleverly paint a picture of what Thatcher dealt with as a woman. Viewers see a young Thatcher (Alexandra Roach) passionately discussing politics with men and then being laughed at with other ladies present.  Once Thatcher becomes a member of Parliament, Lloyd shows her having to drive away, her kids running after the car as she leaves, exemplifying the struggle to balance her home and work life.
As Thatcher in her prime, Streep delivers a gripping, engaging performance. She commits herself to both versions of Thatcher: the determined leader and the grieving, unstable older woman. The political scenes especially stand out, as Streep delivers lines with a passion and vigor that effectively convey why Thatcher received the nickname the “Iron Lady.”
Lloyd’s depiction of Thatcher, however, doesn’t just herald her accomplishments, The Iron Lady also sheds light on — if only briefly — family issues, governmental struggles and power hunger. The film does not confine itself to perfect historical accuracy, even when portraying major historical events.
When the war against Argentina over the Falkland Islands results in British casualties, for example, Lloyd shows Thatcher’s human, perhaps more feminine side. Streep sits in front of a television watching the damage and tears up, simply stating “I must write to them.”
Lloyd then shows Thatcher sitting at a table, handwriting personal letters to the families of the dead. The film effectively infuses even the most political scenes with the more human side of Thatcher’s personality.
It might be disappointing to some viewers to see Thatcher slightly crumble even after a scalding admonishment from her colleagues, but that was perhaps Lloyd’s intention from the beginning — to paint a different picture from the one most viewers have of Thatcher. It’s this multifaceted approach that makes the film engaging and engrossing even when the scenes feel too jumbled and the action slow.
The Iron Lady takes some risks, especially when it comes to the many scenes with Denis, and does not always flow smoothly. Regardless, the film is an insightful look at the struggles behind becoming the first female prime minister — and what it takes to pick up the pieces afterward.
