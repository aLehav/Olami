The streaking USC football team practiced on Howard Jones Field on Wednesday, continuing preparation for Saturday’s game against Oregon. The Ducks bring their high-powered offense to the Coliseum this weekend, and the Trojans will look to outgun their opponents, who average over 40 points per game.
Since the Chip Kelly revolution in Eugene, Oregon has been synonymous with a breakneck offense, most famously producing speedster quarterback Marcus Mariota. But even with the Kelly-Mariota juggernaut now long gone, the Trojans remain wary of the Ducks’ threat, and the week’s preparations focused on containing it.
“When you see Oregon on tape, you just feel the speed,” head coach Clay Helton said. “Without question, over the last seven years I’ve been here, they’ve always been the fastest team we’ve played.”
Redshirt junior safety Chris Hawkins agreed, and he also praised the Ducks’ ability to make big plays on offense.
“This might be the best skill position set that we’ve seen all year,” he said. “As a defense, we have to communicate well and stay poised in what we do and in what coach is teaching us this week.”
With a multitude of threats in the Oregon stable, from wideout Darren Carrington II to running back Royce Freeman, Helton stressed the need for defensive efficiency on Saturday.
“Anytime you’re facing a tempo team…one of the most critical situations is being able to get off the field on defense,” he said.
And the key to achieving that goal likely lies in containing Oregon’s quarterback, Justin Herbert. The talented true freshman will make his third career start this weekend, and Helton was determined to make the rookie uncomfortable.
“It’s imperative to get pressure on this quarterback on third down,” he said. “If you don’t hit this kid, you’re going to have a long day because he can distribute.”
“They’re opening up the playbook for him each time he gets another start, so I’m sure we’ll see some stuff we haven’t seen yet,” Hawkins added. “Hopefully, him being a freshman, we can disguise and get some hands on some balls.”
USC will take the field against Oregon needing every win it can get. In the team’s penultimate home game of the season, Hawkins hoped the fans would roar their Trojans through.
“I’m sure the Coliseum is going to be pretty loud,” he said. “It should be. We’re on a roll right now, so I expect a whole lot of fans to be out there.”

In the argument of student-athlete compensation, one side generally defends the current system saying that these athletes are getting their tuition paid for and that is a huge sum of money. Of course, not all college athletes are on a full-ride scholarship, but for those that are; their scholarship doesn’t achieve its full value.
Photo courtesy USC Sports InformationBusy schedule · The men’s golf team has a busy November, playing on Monday and Tuesday before hitting the links again next week for three days. It’s just one instance of an athletic team tied down by a rough schedule.
Student-athletes continually choose their sport over school because the Pac-12 and their school force them to. How can anyone expect student-athletes to put their academics first when their governing bodies refuse to do the same?
This debate is especially relevant given all the attention that Thursday night football games have been given and their impact on the minutes football players spend in the classroom, but it isn’t just about football players. Once again the massive entity that is collegiate football has overshadowed the non-revenue sports that suffer from this problem just as much if not more.
The men’s golf team has two consecutive weeks in November in which they have a tournament during the week. This week, the team played on Monday and Tuesday and next week they will be on the links Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
That means they are missing the equivalent of a full week of school from just two tournaments.
The women’s volleyball team also plays a significant number of times during the week. This week they played in Tucson on Wednesday night and again in Tempe on Friday, meaning they will miss Tuesday through Friday this week.
“On Tuesday we travel, Wednesday we play and Thursday we travel to Tempe,” women’s volleyball head coach Mick Haley said to the Daily Trojan before the team left. “Then we play early Friday at 6 p.m., but we can’t get out that night, which is terrible because we have to get up early to get them back by 9 the next morning on Saturday.”
This atrocious schedule leaves very little room to achieve academic excellence. In the same interview, Haley said he thought the team would only be in school for eight days in November.
It doesn’t matter how many administrators and coaches come out and say academics are the priority for their teams if their actions speak differently.
This isn’t a new problem either and the NCAA in all its resplendent glory is aware of the problem.
The organization has conducted a study in order to gain insight into the experiences and well being of student athletes. This survey, “Growth, Opportunity, Aspirations and Learning of Students in College,” was conducted in 2006, 2010 and most recently in 2015.
The findings are disheartening, considering the word student comes first in student-athlete. In Division I schools, athletes reported dedicating a median of 34 hours a week to their sport in-season, a two-hour increase since 2010. Not surprisingly, football players spent the most time, averaging 42 hours a week. The other sport that struck the 40-hour mark — that of a full-time job — was baseball at 40 hours per week.
The silver lining is that athletes also said they are spending more time on academics than they were in 2010 with the number of hours per week rising from 35.5 hours to 38.5 hours while they are in season. Across the board, female student-athletes said they spent more time studying than their male counterparts.
Fifty-nine percent of male and 66 percent of female Division I athletes said they want to spend more time on academics during the season. The three sports who consistently reported they spent significantly more time on athletics than academics were football, baseball and men’s golf.
Student-athletes are missing class at very high rates as well. Ten percent of football players reported missing three or more classes a week during their season, and this was the lowest number among of the categories the NCAA provided for Division I athletes. Nineteen percent of baseball players, 21 percent of men’s basketball players and 22 percent of women’s basketball players — all limited to Division I athletes — reported missing three or more classes a week during their season.
Between the time spent traveling or working out and the time spent pursuing a degree, the life of a college athlete is far busier than most average students. Unfortunately, most of the student-athletes surveyed were not dissatisfied with these time commitments during the season.
By promoting a culture of athletics taking precedent over academics, these athletes are being done a disservice by their universities.
According to the NCAA, just 1.6 percent of NCAA football players go on to compete in the NFL. 1.1 percent of men’s basketball players make it to the NBA and for baseball players, 9.7 will be drafted by a Major League team.
By taking athletes out of the classroom for such a significant time, the University is taking away valuable preparation for a world beyond athletics. This isn’t to say that college sports should be done away with, there just needs to be some reform in the amount of time that these athletes are expected to contribute to their schools when what they are receiving in return — their education — is being taken away from them.

No. 25 women’s volleyball fell to Arizona in five sets on Wednesday night in Tucson (25-23, 18-25, 22-25, 25-17, 15-7) to drop its first match on the road.
Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanNo road magic · Sophomore outside hitter Alyse Ford had seven digs, but it was not enough on Wednesday as USC lost its first road match.
In the fifth and final set, the Trojans fell behind 7-1 and never recovered as Arizona took the set 15-7.
Freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier led the Trojans with 18 kills and 11 digs, while sophomore outside hitter Alyse Ford recorded 15 kills and eight digs.
The Trojans are now 15-9 overall and 7-6 in the Pac-12. They are 5-1 on the road.
With the match even at a set apiece, the Trojans took the lead with a win in the third set as Lanier dropped three spikes, fueling a 4-1 run to give USC a 25-22 win. Senior middle blocker Elise Ruddins and junior outside hitters Nikki Withers combined for a block to end the set.
But USC couldn’t close it out in the fourth set. The Women of Troy went on a 4-0 run to take a 9-8 lead, but the Wildcats put up a run of four in five points to jump ahead 14-12. They finished the set with a 13-5 run to even the match at two sets apiece and force a fifth set.
The Trojans dropped the first set 25-23 despite leading 17-12 and jumping out to a 5-1 lead. Ford delivered a spike to put USC ahead 7-3. The Trojans fended off one 3-0 run by the Wildcats, but not another surge. Arizona won 6-straight points to go ahead 18-17 and held off USC to claim the first set.
USC responded in the second set, answering an early pace set by the Wildcats this time. Arizona opened ahead 5-1, but the Trojans won eight of the next nine points to take the lead. The teams went back and forth before USC jumped ahead for good 20-13 following strong work from senior middle blocker Elise Ruddins and junior opposite Brittany Abercrombie. USC claimed the second set 25-18, with Ford’s seventh spike sealing the deal.
Next up, the Trojans will take on Arizona State on Friday in Tempe.
What else is new for this season. This team is poorly coached and conditioned with no leadership on the court.

Redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne spoke to the media on Wednesday for the first time since head coach Clay Helton said he was granted permission to contact other schools, signifying Browne’s intentions to transfer.
After playing behind Cody Kessler for three years and then getting replaced by redshirt freshman Sam Darnold before a Week 4 loss at Utah, Browne decided that his time with the Men of Troy has an upcoming expiration date. On Wednesday, signal caller laid out his plans for the rest of his Trojan career.
Tal Volk | Daily TrojanSplitting up · Redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne will seek other options after he was granted permission to speak with other programs.
“For the next few weeks at least, I’ll just see who contacts me,” Browne said. “Come December, maybe I’ll start reaching out to schools that I think would be a good fit … and see if there’s mutual interest on their end.”
Helton, who awarded Browne the starting job at the start of the season, praised Browne for his professionalism when making the announcement on Tuesday
“Max has been so good to us and so good to this football team and is a graduate, and that’s what’s most important,” Helton said. “He’s graduated from this University, and he’s done everything right. So, he deserves the opportunity to find his perfect fit, whether it’s here or someplace else.”
After backing up Kessler for three seasons, Browne entered camp with the expectation of competing for the starting job.
But upon beating Darnold in the fall’s quarterback competition, Browne struggled as a starter. The Trojans went 1-2 with him under center, including a season-opening 52-6 loss against Alabama.
Beyond a lackluster record, Browne was largely ineffective at leading the USC offense with just two passing touchdowns in three games and 507 passing yards.
And although his 63.7 percent completion was among tops in the Pac-12 during that span, his key incompletions late in drives allowed Darnold to step up and assume the starting job.
“You think about it right away,” Browne said after losing the starting job before the game against Utah. “You think about all the possibilities at hand, but at the end of the day, it’s only Week 4. There is a lot of ball to play, and so I’ll stay ready.”
Since being benched, Browne has watched Darnold and the Trojans win four of their past five games and put themselves back in contention in the Pac-12 South. From then, it didn’t take long for him to look elsewhere.
“I lost my job, but I still had one more year of eligibility: That’s the beauty of graduating early,” he said. “This is just part of the deal, I guess.”
With his decision to transfer, the former Gatorade National High School Player of the Year can join a new school as early as January to participate in winter and spring camps, and he is open to all options.
“I made sure my headline said ‘all NCAA schools’ for a reason: I’m willing to go anywhere,” Browne said. “That was the case out of high school, and it’s no different, if not more emphasized, now.”
Browne has one season of eligibility remaining and has been granted permission to contact any school, including those in the Pac-12. He can play immediately after transferring since he graduated last fall, bypassing NCAA rules for transfers to sit out a year.
Browne admitted he had some specific schools in mind but kept mum for now.
“To be completely honest, I don’t know how I want to juggle that moving forward, so I’m going to keep it to myself,” he said.
As he emphasized, Browne is eligible to transfer to all NCAA schools, including the Football Championship Subdivision. It’s likely not a destination the 21-year-old would prefer, but he wouldn’t rule anything out.
“It’ll be interesting. I think it’ll depend on the next month or so — what feelers I get,” he said. “Not saying it’s out of the question, but I guess we’ll just see the response I get from other schools.”
Considering the timing of this announcement, it appears that Darnold is looking at a lengthy starting career with USC. As for the rest of the season, Browne will continue to practice and can still earn the starting job should Darnold sustain injury.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Max Browne had a 1-3 record as a starter at USC. His record was 1-2, not 1-3. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

South Korea has created an international industry featuring a number of rising artists in the popular musical genre called K-pop, short for Korean pop. This Friday, Korean pop rapper and singer CL will take the stage in Los Angeles, delivering her fifth concert since the commencement of her North American tour.
Photo courtesy of CLCultural icon · Dubbed the Nicki Minaj of the Korean music industry, CL’s fans call her “The Baddest Female” in terms of her music and fashion sense.
Dubbed the Nicki Minaj of the K-pop industry, CL has gained an international database consisting of thousands of devoted fans, and her American debut marks a significant step in her career as an artist. She launched her music industry as a rapper in a Korean female band called 2NE1 in 2009, but it was only recently in November 2015 that she debuted as a solo artist in Korea with her first successful single.
Her North American tour is called Hello Bi+ches, a namesake inspired after her solo single and is taking place across nine major cities in the United States and Canada. Her Los Angeles concert will be at the Microsoft Theater on Friday, Nov. 4 at 8:30 p.m.
So far, CL has received promising responses from American fans and Western audiences, after her performance on The Late Late Show with James Corden in late September to promote her first American single, titled “Lifted.”
Audiences nationwide praised her strong stage presence, and CL’s versatility as an artist is exhibited within her hip-hop style and rap performance. CL performed in her first-ever solo concert in New York on Oct. 29 but received astounding reviews due to her experience as a seasoned performer in her former girl group.
Besides her performance style, CL stands out in appearance. She sheds the stereotypes pushed on Korean artists, especially female singers, by Asian cultural standards. Her silver hair and dark makeup take inspiration from Western beauty standards, signifying her personal desire to make a bold statement as an Asian figure in the North American music industry.
Her international fan base calls CL “The Baddest Female,” illustrating her brazenly bold music style and fashion tastes. Besides working as an artist and delivering music, CL serves as a cultural icon in South Korea, and her on-stage fashion tastes exemplify her femininity while containing hints of her more subtle, tomboyish personality.
CL will embody her multicultural appeals by performing a variety of songs in both English and Korean. Her concert is expected to feature not only songs from CL’s recent releases, but also tracks from her time with the Korean pop group 2NE1.
At her debut performance in New York, CL greeted the stage by saying “I’m CL from 2NE1,” her signature line from the lyrics of 2NE1’s debut single “Fire.” Although she plans to deliver her popular show-stoppers, she will also perform multiple ballads that were part of the group’s discography.

Last Monday, as I headed to the PETA Bob Barker Building in Echo Park to pick up literature for an on-campus event, I received a promising opportunity for salvation from Los Angeles. Caroline Gardner, the Youth Outreach Coordinator at peta2 and my tour administrator on the Vans Warped Tour, asked me if I would like to manage peta2’s outreach at two concerts for the pop-punk band, Farewell, My Love — in Tucson on Friday and in Albuquerque, on Saturday. Naturally, I said yes.
After arriving in Tucson, I picked up my peta2 package at the local UPS and headed straight to the venue, brimming with the immense excitement that outreach always brings. The two local peta2 volunteers helped me unload the materials. We arranged all of the literature on the table: Guides to Going Vegan, “Save 100 Animals” leaflets, cruelty free shopping guides, “Flesh is for Zombies” Halloween themed leaflets and lots of stickers. We stood with our “Free Stuff” signs in front of our “Help Animals: Try Veg” table banner, alluring people to pledge to try veg in exchange for our abundance of literature.
The campaign urges people to incorporate a more plant-based diet into their lives in a manageable capacity, whether that’s going vegetarian for a week, removing  red meat from their diet, or cutting out dairy products on the weekends. Of course the ideal is veganism, but encouraging a steady pace by instituting one or two changes is a more attainable achievement and is usually a necessary precursor for a successful transition to a completely plant-based diet.
Surprisingly, the five-hour show had no more than 30 attendees … The peta2 volunteers and I engaged concert-goers in meaningful conversations about the benefits of going vegan or vegetarian, while simultaneously listening to male singers blow their vocal chords out. Pursuing intellectual conversations while immersing oneself in earth-shattering screams requires a caliber of coordination not to be underestimated.
The next day, the Albuquerque show had almost triple the amount of attendees. Ironically enough, the third volunteer couldn’t make it. Due to the intimate one-room venue, the local volunteer and I reached out to people among the crowd during the transitions between acts, for 10 minutes at a time. We had a high success rate, as measured by the number of texts sent to peta2, possibly as a factor of the vibrant energy remaining from the preceding “moshtoberfest.” I spent Sunday, the last day of my paid work-travel experience, exploring Albuquerque. Midday, I ate at Gatos y Galletas, a cat cafe, in Downtown. I navigated through the many shops in the historic Old Town, strolled through the scenic botanical gardens and ended my day helping an elderly woman escape from a locked bathroom stall — never had I been so frightened upon entering a Holiday Inn bathroom as I was when I heard the screams of that helpless old lady.
When I was in Tucson on Friday, instead of staying at a hotel like I did in Albuquerque, I got to visit my Chicago friends from home at the University of Arizona. The venue was fortunately less than a mile from my friend’s residence.
This adventure-filled weekend was necessary to a wholesome restabilization, especially after two months of containment in Los Angeles. Aside from passionately advocating for animal rights, I got to reconnect with my childhood friends, visit new cities and eat delicious vegan food, all while exercising my independence.
I learned a couple of important lessons. First, it’s vital to remain open to new opportunities, especially when they seem inconvenient, because they make life all the more meaningful. Last but not least, following your passions opens the doors, or in this case, the terminals to a plethora of trips around the globe.  Your passport will become chock full of country stamps, and your increasing life-experience will make you a world traveler from your exposure to new situations embraced on a whim.

Election day is near, and as nationwide polls continue to tighten in the moments leading up to the election, students at the USC Annenberg Media Center have planned an afternoon full of political surprises to engage the student body to vote in the upcoming election.
The event, called Vote 2016, is a political fair to be hosted today from 2 to 3 p.m. in the Wallis Annenberg Hall lobby.
The fair is hosted by the producing staff of The Current, USC’s student-run political broadcast that airs live every Thursday evening in the Annenberg Media Center. The center’s political unit has worked extensively with the election coverage, hosting live discussions and analyses after the four national debates.
The political fair, however, is a more interactive method that USC journalists hope will engage audiences with election news.
The hour-long event provides the USC community a chance to engage with the student producers of The Current and be a part of their live broadcast while partaking in entertaining politics-inspired activities.
Attendees of the Vote 2016 Fair will be able to watch The Current live on the Annenberg Media website or on Facebook after their event.
The fair is an attempt to add some fun to students’ upcoming civic duty and remind them that though politics isn’t always fun and games, it doesn’t have to be boring. The nation’s attention is currently focused on the presidential election, but the fair will have a variety of activities that cover topics pertinent to California’s state election as well.
The activities range from a cookie poll to a game of “Proposition Twister” that will attempt to educate students on the numerous California propositions. With over 17 propositions in California this year that range from marijuana legalization (Prop. 64) to multilingual education (Prop. 58), a game of Twister will effectively test students’ ability to recognize and understand the laws they will be voting on.
“I’m stoked for the presidential candidate cookies. I am just looking forward to seeing how the fair will make politics feel more engaging and exciting,” said Hannah Vega, an anchor at The Current.
The fair’s activities will be placed within five booths in the lobby of Wallis Annenberg Hall, giving passersby a chance to interact with each individual booth. There will be a discussion booth, titled Talk About It, where voters will be able to share their views on the election. Regardless of whether attendees are Clinton, Trump or third party supporters, all are welcome to contribute their voice to a democratic discussion.

With less than a week left until election day, the last impression that candidates left on the voters was the third presidential debate on Oct. 19 in Las Vegas. After Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton were finished going at each other’s throats once again, the winner was clear: Clinton remained presidential while Trump went up in flames.
Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
However, there was one weak spot for Clinton, which, had Trump pressed further, would have made the winner of the debate less clear. When Clinton affirmed that she has always supported an individual’s right to own a gun, Trump brought up her opposition to the Supreme Court’s 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which affirmed Second Amendment rights. Clinton defended her former opposition, saying that the overturned piece of legislation was designed to “protect toddlers from guns.” Even though a part of the ordinance did address the possibility of a 2-year-old stumbling across a gun, it mainly revolved around the question of banning handguns entirely. Her past stance, which was extremely liberal, has now shifted toward a more moderate one — and some view it as “flip-flopping” on issues, a common critique of Clinton. Some might criticize her for allowing her opinions to evolve as the times change — otherwise known as not only being a rational human being, but an intelligent politician. Clinton’s evolution on issues like gun control showcases the necessary ability for a politician to admit when they are wrong and create more dynamic policy — ultimately rendering them a better public servant.
For starters, opinions change; that’s what they are meant to do. If a person sticks to an opinion, and continues holding on to it years later, even in light of new information, even in light of changes in personal character, even in light of circumstances, the person is then a blind dogmatist. One of the virtues of being a good politician is flexibility.
In the light of numerous shootings during the last decade — either accidents caused by unsupervised toddlers using guns or mentally ill shooters firing into crowds of innocent people — much of the American public is crying out for tighter gun control, including background checks and closing loopholes that allow for an easy gun purchase. Clinton’s extremely liberal stance was directly in response to public sentiment, even if extreme.
Recently, however, the pendulum began to swing back, with people wondering whether banning guns altogether would not have the intended effect, and as a result, mostly the criminals would be armed. Perhaps civilians with guns could have prevented previous mass shootings. Clinton, sensitive to the public opinion, has shifted her views accordingly.
For an ever-changing, diverse country like America, the future president needs to be a progressive and go along with the country’s mood, instead of being entrenched in the sand while the stream of events pass by it, until it erodes to nothing.
Her critics’ argument, however, is a little more elaborate than just her changing stances. The condemnation stems from an observation that her views change according to those in power, making it seem like Clinton has no spine and will say anything to get political support, such as changing her stance on gun ownership.
What is essential to keep in mind is that Clinton is not only a politician, but also a woman. In the political world, men can easily prevent a woman from rising up the hierarchy, especially those in power.
Now, seeing as she is up against Trump, Clinton realizes that her views need to shift to the more moderate side, appealing to undecided voters. Most politicians have used these tactics in the elections, so it wouldn’t be fair to single out Hillary Clinton for playing the political game.
Since Trump voiced an “unwavering support of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms” and vowed to “empower law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves,” Clinton realized that he would be appealing to Southern gun fanatics, while she would be appealing to tree-hugging liberals.
While this bipartisan election has created a severe rift between the two political camps, much of America is still in the middle of the spectrum. To win their support, Clinton had to compromise: Now, she says that she is for individuals owning guns, but only if they pass rigorous background checks.
Whenever backing out out of a previous opinion, Clinton cited either the changing times or simply being wrong. In the case of gun control, she chooses the former, but if this agenda goes wrong or proves to be inefficient, she will recognize the latter.
The hardest thing to do for anyone, let alone a politician who is always in the limelight and dependent on public opinion, is to admit fault. But her willingness to say when she is wrong is in staunch contrast to Trump, who, even when the facts say he is wrong, claims he is right.
An admirable and challenging characteristic that one would want our future president to have is to acknowledge mistakes, take responsibility for them and move on with an eye toward the future: everything that Clinton has been doing.
Hey Oksana, when you say Clinton remained presidential while Trump went up in flames, do you believe she would make a fine president for a corrupt country such as Somalia or Venezuela?  It’s funny how people see what they want to see.
Let’s not enable, or make excuses for, deceitful politicians. Political consultants make lots of money in return for doing so; ordinary people should not volunteer for the task.
It’s amazing how liberals rationalize Hillary’s being on every side of every issue.

If you were on Facebook over the weekend, you probably saw among the Halloween pictures and election posts at least one friend check in at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Most of these friends, however, were likely not in North Dakota. According to the Los Angeles Times, over 1.3 million people have checked in to the reservation after a post asking all Facebook users to stand in solidarity with the water protectors at Standing Rock went viral. The call for check-ins claimed that Morton County Sheriff’s Department had been using social media in order to target protests and if more people checked in, police would be less able to disrupt the demonstrations.
While Snopes has declared the claims made in the viral Facebook post to be “unproven” and the Sheriff’s Department has denied that the check-ins will affect its work, the check-ins have succeeded in mobilizing support for the anti-Dakota Access Pipeline movement. The Dakota Access Pipeline, an oil pipeline that, if completed, would stretch 1,172 miles from North Dakota to Illinois, was originally slated to cross the Missouri River just north of Bismarck. However, according to the Bismarck Tribune, this plan was rejected due to the “threat to Bismarck’s water supply” and is now supposed to cross the river near the Standing Rock reservation. It comes as no surprise, then, that members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe are outraged and doing everything in their power to halt the pipeline’s construction. Constructing the pipeline on these ancestral lands could have devastating effects both to the culture of the Sioux and to the environment.
Though 412 protesters have been arrested as of Oct. 30,  it has been difficult to ensure coverage of the demonstrations. Support from celebrities like actress Shailene Woodley has been somewhat able to garner attention, and certain aspects of the protests, like the warrant out for the arrest of Democracy Now! journalist Amy Goodman, have received coverage from mainstream outlets. However, overall, the events at Standing Rock have been underreported, or even ignored. According to Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, neither NBC or ABC have so much as mentioned the protests.
Social media has, therefore, been necessary in raising awareness about the protests and ensuring the water protectors have the resources they need to continue the fight. The hashtag #NoDAPL is filled with pictures of a militarized police force closing in on protesters. Facebook users like Atsa E’sha Hoferer have utilized the site’s livestreaming feature to report in real time the actions on the ground.
The result of online movements has been successful. A Facebook Live post Hoferer shared on Oct. 27 has been viewed 161,000 times. Despite claims that it was a hoax, the Facebook check-ins have been successful insofar as they have forced outlets like The New York Times to cover the story. Most significantly, perhaps, the Sacred Stone camp, where protesters have been staying on the reservation, has been sustained in large part due to successful crowdfunding. The official GoFundMe for the camp began at $5,000. In the last six months, however, over $1 million has been raised to support camp supplies. This does not include a separate crowdfunding campaign to “support the legal defense of warriors protecting land, water, and human rights,” which has also raised over a million dollars.
As tensions rise between police and protectors, the people on the ground at Standing Rock need all of the support they can get. The abuse and degradation of indigenous land and the tribes that live there is not unprecedented, and it must be condemned. So while it is still unconfirmed whether checking in to the protest actually deters police action on the ground, the support and solidarity shown through these check-ins is invaluable.

During our senior year of high school, my friend and I thought it would be funny to create a SoundCloud that mocked the boys in my grade because it felt like every guy we knew was always creating the “perfect” playlist or trying to be famous. One year later, I can genuinely say that that stupid joke was one of the best decisions I have ever made.
We joined SoundCloud with no intention of genuinely falling in love with the service itself because we thought it would always be our little inside joke, but we slowly became obsessed. In the beginning, we did not let anyone follow us and kept it a secret, but inadvertently it changed me.
I have always loved music and appreciated music for its entirety; however, I never really followed music. And what I mean by following music is actively following different artists, learning about new artists, and listening to new tracks posted daily. I always learned about music from the radio or iTunes, but SoundCloud completely changed that.
I do not know when or how, but I became obsessed with electronic music, and not only electronic music, but all genres of music. I started to spend countless hours listening to complete albums and unedited tracks, which I had never done before. I also found myself excited to talk about music with anyone and always asking people to share with me their favorite music.
Not only did my feelings on SoundCloud change, but I changed as a person. I started to become more open-minded to different music, different people, and different ideas. I realized that the only person I was hurting by hating on a genre of music or a group of people was myself. At the end of the day, there are so many exciting aspects of life that one can learn about if he or she is open-minded and willing to try things he or she hates without any reason.
From SoundCloud, I have learned about artists that have become an integral part of who I am- Jeremy Zucker, Matt DiMona, and Lido- and I have created friendships through our mutual love of music. Not only that, music is the perfect conversation starter and is a topic that I love to debate, discuss, and experience with others.
So for now, I will keep scrolling through my SoundCloud listening to the new Post Malone or Sam Galletraity track. And if I am lucky, I’ll tune in to a song that one of my friends has sent to me because it reminded them of me. On a side-note: there is nothing better than this because (1) it is so genuine and (2) sincere.
If you want to follow my SoundCloud you can, but be prepared for a wide variety of music, the fact that I share it with my friend living on the other side of the country, and that I repost a lot. Get a SoundCloud, it just might change you too!

Students filled Bovard Auditorium to listen to a live recording of the hit CollegeHumor “Jake and Amir” podcast on Tuesday evening. The event, hosted by the USC Undergraduate Student Government Speakers Committee, featured comedians Jake Hurwitz and Amir Blumenfeld, who recently started an advice podcast titled “If I Were You.”
Halfway through the recording of the podcast, the comedians took a break and took questions from the audience regarding relationships, selfies and hypothetical situations. 
Elizabeth Bricker, the director of the USG Special Events Committee, said they received a positive reaction from people, many of whom were fans of the CollegeHumor series in high school, on the event’s Facebook page.
“It has a huge fanbase, kind of a cult following,” Bricker said. “We’ve gotten a great response among all of their fans interacting with each other on the Facebook page, which is cool, with inside jokes about the series.”
Bricker, a senior majoring in East Asian languages and cultures, said that the planning of the event took extra consideration because of the size of the venue.
“It usually takes about six weeks when you bring a speaker to campus, but because it’s at Bovard Auditorium, there’s a lot more that goes into it because Bovard’s our biggest venue on campus,” Bricker said.
Audience members varied in terms of their familiarity with the duo. Isabella Smith, a junior majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering, said she’s more of a casual fan.
“I’ve seen a few of their videos and I’m also in USG so I knew this was happening and I was really excited that I was able to come,” Smith said. 
Nav Pillai, a junior studying computer science, said he’s a big fan of the comedians. 
“I’ve listened to all of their podcast episodes and I’m a fan of their videos so I thought it was a cool opportunity that popped up.” 
Pillai said he expected the event to be either a hit or a miss. 
“Either they gel with the crowd a lot or they just bomb sometimes, and I don’t know which one I want to see more,” Pillai said. 
The podcast episode will air on a later date on Hurwitz and Blumenfeld’s new podcast network, Headgum.

It’s incredible to see how many people care – how many people make conscious efforts to walk more and drive less, or to change their lightbulbs, or to recycle, or preserve water. However, people can only act on what they know and understand, and the sad truth is that the number one contributor to global warming, deforestation and the emission of methane into our atmosphere is widely unknown.
The number one contributor is not energy consumption. It is not transport. It is not simply an over-watering of our front gardens (although all these three play a large role).
The number one contributor is in fact Animal Agriculture. 
Let’s get the facts* straight:
The amount of facts and scary realities surrounding animal agriculture is unbelievable – this list alone could go on for pages. But the message remains the same: what you eat – animals and animal products – have a direct and profound impact on our environment. Even if you were to stop driving, shortened all your showers to two minutes each time, turned on lights only when and if you needed them and consciously recycled as often and cleanly as possible, the consumption of beef and other animal products would keep enormous your personal carbon footprint.
Now, I won’t sit here and preach virtually and harshly the need for everyone to suddenly and wholeheartedly adopt a vegan lifestyle. Veganism is a choice, and a conscious effort, I understand. The same goes, even, for becoming vegetarian or pescatarian. Some people are simply frightened out of these dietary choices by labels, social stigmas and a minority of aggressive activists. 
However, I will preach to you that if you claim to care about the environment in any way, shape or form (and you should, given the undeniable facts that are flooding our internet and social media awareness today about global warming and human civilization), then you need to address the way you eat. 
Many people consume animals and animal products for religious and other traditional, innate reasons. Sometimes it’s a lack of education (believe it or not, meat is not your only source of protein!) However, many people choose to continue eating animals and animal products purely for taste, habit and/or convenience. There is a vast difference, yet also vast similarities. 
At the end of the day, turning away from consuming animals and animal products will help our earth (and you) – and yes, one person makes a difference. Change of this manner is spread through a ripple effect: the less people that want to eat animals, the less demand for meat and animal products exists within society, the less factories can afford to continue operating slaughterhouses or cutting down rainforests for grazing.
Even if you decide not to cut out animal products, simply turning away from beef – the leader of all animal contributors by significant lengths – to other animal products can and will make an enormous difference. 
What you eat affects where you live, and how you live.
Lucky what you choose to buy and consume is completely up to you, day in, day out.
It’s that simple.

Alexandra Ting | Daily TrojanReady for action · Senator Tiffany Lian stressed the importance of preparedness in her active shooter training proposal at Tuesday’s meeting.
Senators Tiffany Lian and Tyler Matheson presented a proposal to make active shooter preparedness training mandatory for students at Tuesday’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting. Senators Leena Danpour and Sabrina Enriquez, as well as Secretary Danya Rafiqi and Parliamentarian Tricia Xu, also worked on drafting the resolution.
The online training would prepare students for how to react in a situation where one or more armed people are present on campus. It would be similar in style to AlcoholEdu, the online drinking safety program that all incoming freshmen are required to complete.
The idea was in part sparked by a shooting on the UCLA campus that took place on June 1, which sent the school into lockdown and ended with the death of a professor. This event, Lian said, hit close to home.
“As neighbors to UCLA, this really woke us up,” Lian said. “If this could happen at UCLA, this could happen at USC just as easily.”
Though the DPS website describes a program called “Run, Hide, Fight,” a method promoted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security describing the best way to react when confronted with an active shooter, few people are aware of this initiative. The plan instructs students to run while leaving personal belongings behind, to hide behind locked doors and to fight only if absolutely necessary.
“The limited lockdown, which is what we used to do in high school, was something that the staff grew up with as well,” Matheson said. “So we have an environment where people don’t really understand the dynamics of what an active shooter situation might be.”
To support their proposal, the senators brought up a 2007 report on the benefits of AlcoholEdu, which was conducted one semester after the program was first implemented at USC. The report indicated that students had a greater awareness of how much they were drinking after completing the program, as well as a better understanding of the dangers associated with excessive alcohol consumption. The senators also mentioned, however, that no further summaries have been done on the performance of AlcoholEdu in the 10 years since its original implementation, which points to a need for regular and thorough reviews to ensure that any mandatory training program is doing its job. 
The active shooter training proposal also pointed out several fatal school shootings, such as incidents at Seattle Pacific University and Umpqua Community College, as evidence of the real dangers that active shooters pose to students, and to stress the importance of  being prepared. 
After Lian and Matheson finished their presentation, Danpour explained her plans to work on tuition transparency by sending out a memorandum to students once the administration figures out what the next year’s tuition will be. The memorandum would compare the previous year’s tuition to the upcoming year’s tuition, as well as show a breakdown of how the tuition money would be allocated.
Sen. Paul Samaha also brought up his plans to advocate for tuition affordability and put a stop to the yearly tuition increases, such as ensuring that a student is present at meetings that decide tuition costs. 
“[The board members] are not in touch with the realities of being a USC student,” Samaha said. “They have no idea that students are starving, that some people end up homeless.”
if you want to mitigate the threat from an active shooter, not sure a PowerPoint or App is going to help. Ask yourself, are the security measures at your school a good deterrent? Are the traditional security methods (door locks, access controls, video cameras) going to stop the bullets? Are those security methods going to reduce the bad guys rampage time? Are those security methods going to triage the wounded? if the average response time from law enforcement is 8 minutes, that means the bad guy has 8 minutes to walk through your buildings with impunity! If there was a solution, would you be interested to learn about it? Look up the Templar Rapid Response System. With respect to the Board Members not being in touch with student issues like hunger or homelessness, important, yes! But of little concern if your school is the next to have a massacre.

With less than a week to go before the presidential election, the Unruh Institute of Politics hosted the second-to-last event in its Road to the White House Series on Tuesday evening at Ground Zero Performance Cafe. 
The panelists discussed what students can expect to take place over the next week as well as the latest installment of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s email controversy. In the wake of FBI Director James Comey’s announcement last Friday that the Bureau would reopen the investigation into Clinton’s private email server, there has been a shift in momentum among voters. What many saw as a clear-cut Clinton victory has suddenly became a tighter race.
The event, “Election Night Preview: What to Watch For,” included a panel featuring: Professor Robert Shrum, the Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics; Rob Stutzman, founder and president of Stutzman Public Affairs; Daniel Wahl, director of USC Students for Trump; and Philine Qian, a member of the USC College Democrats. Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, and Matt Lemas, editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan, co-moderated the panel. The event was co-sponsored by the USC College Republicans, the USC College Democrats and the Daily Trojan.
Shrum began by clarifying that, though an announcement similar to Comey’s is quite rare so close to the election, it is not entirely as unprecedented in American politics as many may think.
“Something like this happened once before, which was when Lawrence Walsh, the special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra case, re-indicted on a third count Casper Weinberger four days before the 1992 presidential election,” Shrum said. “That was thought to be outrageous at the time.”
Rob Stutzman argued that, though Comey should resign due to his apparent willingness to engage in public discourse, the root cause of this affair can be traced back to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
“This whole problem started … with [Comey] having to be in charge and take the lead on this investigation, because the Attorney General of the United States met for 30 minutes privately … with the former President of the United States William Jefferson Clinton,” Stutzman said. “Because of the appearances of impropriety at that meeting, Attorney General Loretta Lynch basically handed the baton to Comey, who hasn’t handled it very well.”
Despite this new development in the ongoing Clinton scandal, Stutzman and Shrum both agreed that it will not have a significant effect on the election as a whole.
Daniel Wahl, the only Trump supporter on the stage, offered his more optimistic opinion on the state of the Trump campaign.
“Donald Trump … received more votes in the primary than any other Republican nominee in history,” Wahl said. “He received 13 million votes, certainly more than Mitt Romney did in 2012 and [McCain did] in 2008 by a margin of roughly 5 million. He’s had so much enthusiasm among his base, and some, like Bill O’Reilly, say it’s the most they’ve seen in the history of politics.”
Students weighed in on the panel afterwards, pointing out the variety of viewpoints held by those on the panel.
“I always like that [the Unruh Institute] brings in a diverse panel,” said Alex Harutunian, a freshman studying business administration. “There was a Trump supporter today, which was the first time they’ve had one, but I always like that they have both Democrats and Republicans at their events. I have yet to see an independent or a third party supporter, but I think that’s because they’re pretty rare.”
Giulia Corno, a freshman majoring in political science and neuroscience, noted her frustration with the lack of focus on policy by the mainstream media.
“I honestly have not read any articles about what their policies are and what they actually think of certain issues,” Corna said. “I don’t know anything beyond the scandals, which is really frustrating for me, especially because this is the first election I’ll be voting in.”
Corna also identified with a comment made by Qian regarding the seemingly self-serving nature of the candidates, and how they appear to be willing to alter their policies to get donor money or support from broader demographics.
“[Philine] was talking about how she wants to see politics change, that it has to be about what’s right and what’s wrong instead of what will get [the candidates] the most money and the most voters,” Corna said. “You need to be putting policies out there that will improve the world, not improve your life.”
The Unruh Institute will host a poll-watching event in the Wallis Annenberg Hall next Tuesday starting at 3 p.m. Students can watch live as the results come in from each state and will have the opportunity to discuss the outcome of the election.

Partners in progress · Carlos García de Alba, general consul of Mexico in Los Angeles, spoke about the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship.
Panelists discussed issues relevant to USC’s Mexican and Mexican American community at the second annual Mexicanos@USC mixer, which took place at Ronald Tutor Hall Tuesday evening. Hosted by the USC AEM Jóvenes chapter, which is also known as the Mexican Entrepreneur Association, and the LA Mexico-Innova’s Comité de Estudiantes y Jóvenes Emprendedores, the event aimed to promote a more cohesive community for students of Mexican heritage on campus.
The speaker list included Carlos García de Alba, the General Consul of Mexico in Los Angeles; John O’Brien, the executive vice dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering; and Javier Martinez, a renowned Mexican businessman and the chairman of the board for AEM.
García, the keynote speaker, was recently appointed to the position of Consul General after serving as Mexico’s Ambassador to Ireland. He began his speech by stressing the importance of the Mexico-U.S. relationship, especially during this election season. 
“Mexico and the Mexican community here in the USA are not the problem. We are a key part of the solution,” García said. 
In his speech, García highlighted the economic interdependence between Mexico and the United States. He noted that Mexico is the second largest export market for the United States, and that Hispanic Americans contribute a significant portion to the U.S. GDP. If undocumented immigrants were to leave the country, the GDP would drop 1.4 percent each year, according to García. 
“We are here to add, not subtract,” García said. 
García also expressed his plans to bring The Mexican Lecture series to USC, which will bring Mexican political leaders, artists, writers and sports figures to the University. He said that the speakers’ forum proposal already has support from USC President C.L. Max Nikias.
García ended his speech by asserting the significance of young people in the world and active student leaders.
“A bet on young people is always a good bet,”  García said. 
O’Brien expressed his belief that, in order for USC to achieve its global mission, it needs to attract the best faculty staff and students from around the world. For his own part, O’Brien has made a concerted effort to change what engineers do, what they look like and where they come from. 
“As we become a more diverse school, we become a better school,” O’Brien said.
Martinez urged Mexico to send more students to U.S. universities and colleges and noted that the numbers are far behind that of Asian countries, even though Mexico is a much closer neighbor. He said that a major problem for the Mexican community in the United States was that they have the numbers, but are not organized well enough to have a loud political voice. Like Consul General García, he said that he believed in the importance of young people. 
“The future belongs to you, not to us,” Martinez said to the students.

Three men allegedly robbed the Smart and Final grocery store on Vermont Avenue on Monday night after tying up the store’s employees, KTLA reported. 
Sergeant V. Salguero of the Los Angeles Police Department’s Southwest Station said that the men were wearing “scary Halloween” masks and have yet to be identified, according to the City News Service.
At least one of the men was armed. However, no shots were fired. 
While there were witnesses present during the robbery, no one was injured.
KTLA reported that the robbers fled with approximately $3,000 in cash.
Though the men fled on foot, the police believe that they might have had a getaway vehicle nearby, Salguero said.
Police have stated that the Smart and Final is fully operational and that students have no need to fear or avoid the area.

On Nov. 8, I will be voting in a presidential election for the first time. To all those people who think that this election is crazy and don’t know who to vote for, I want to let you know that I understand completely and I could go on and on about how weird this election cycle is, but for time’s sake, I urge you to vote for the most qualified and prepared presidential candidate to lead our country. And that candidate is Hillary Clinton. 
Now, that doesn’t mean that I think she’s a flawless candidate. Clinton has been scrutinized in the public eye for quite some time now, as First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. Senator of New York and Secretary of State. These are not easy jobs, and she has made mistakes. I’m not denying that. But I don’t think she would be human if she didn’t make mistakes. 
I am voting for Hillary Clinton because she will fight for the entire spectrum of Americans, not just a select group or subset of society. Her vision for America is a country that champions its unique differences and supports other individuals regardless of race, national origin, gender, religious belief, sexual orientation, etc. Whether it’s proving more tax reliefs to working class families and cutting taxes for small businesses to grow, or cutting interest rates so that college students will be able to tackle student debt, or offering a full and equal path to citizenship or promoting naturalization, Clinton has fought for and will continue to fight for every group in society and ensure that all our voices are heard. Her policies outline effective solutions and ways to make America inclusive to everyone. It is only through promoting inclusion and unity that we can move forward and progress as a nation. 
I am voting for Hillary Clinton because she understands that climate change is real and that we must take action to combat other environmental issues such as deforestation, global warming and ocean resource depletion. As an environmentalist and vegan myself, I want a president who recognizes the threat that climate change poses to our everyday lives and works toward leaving a sustainable planet for our future generations. Hillary has proposed concrete policies for addressing some of the most pressing environmental threats, whereas Donald Trump continuously denies that climate change exists, calling it “a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese.” Climate change is real, and we need a president who has a plan to tackle it. 
On Nov. 8, you have the power to make your voice heard and make a statement about what kind of country you want to see in the coming years. Voting for Donald Trump is equivalent to setting back all the progress that Democrats have worked tirelessly on during these past few years, including marriage equality, affordable healthcare and gun violence prevention. Voting for Donald Trump entails normalizing sexist remarks toward women, being complacent with racial slurs against people who don’t quite fit the mold of “being American” and dividing a nation that has embarked on so much progress to incorporate compassion in its domestic and foreign policies. The America I want to see is a nation that celebrates diversity and works for everyone, instead of a nation that promulgates fear, resentment and pitting people against each other. Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who can bring about a positive vision for our country, and I am proud to say that I’m with her.
