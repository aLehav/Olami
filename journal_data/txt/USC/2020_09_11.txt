Let’s go back to 1955 and meet 26-year-old football player Ray Dennison.
Dennison was a right guard for the Fort Lewis A&M Aggies in Colorado. Dennison attended Fort Lewis on scholarship as an Army veteran benefitting from the GI Bill.
In the opening kickoff return against Trinidad Junior College that September, Dennison was kneed in the helmet by the ball carrier. The impact shattered the base of Dennison’s skull against his spine, and he died two days later as a result of the injuries.
After Dennison’s death his widow, Billie, filed a claim for death benefits under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. The Colorado Industrial Commission approved the claim, but Fort Lewis fought the case all the way to the Colorado Supreme Court in 1957.
The ruling?
Dennison did not qualify for death benefits. Fort Lewis “was not in the football business,” and football players are not college employees— they are “student athletes.” It was the first published use of the term, and it changed the course of NCAA history.
When breaking down the label “student-athlete,” its frustratingly vague nature becomes apparent, and that’s exactly why the NCAA used the term in its first legal defense as to why college athletes shouldn’t be paid. 
“Student-athlete” is a double-edged label. The term delegates players at a higher level than just students at play, but it also downgrades the implication that they compete at a level above average. This term fits the middle ground, allowing the NCAA to delegate scholarships as their form of compensation. 
Basically, it means “overworked individuals.” The expectation that student-athletes can’t exceed at both parts of their label is now the NCAA’s defense to avoiding compensation. 
What the Colorado judges said in 1957 by using the term “student-athlete” in their ruling was that the designation isn’t noble enough to earn labor rights — student-athletes are individuals whose injuries on the job are fluke accidents caused by extracurricular pursuits. 
The NCAA in the decades since has only grown. A “football business” is now an understatement for what the association truly is: an empire. 
But the NCAA’s main revenue generators are still delegated as amateurs. In fact, “student-athlete” has been a heavy crutch in the association’s countless legal defenses since 1957. In the defense against athletes’ rights to profit from licensing in O’Bannon v. NCAA, a San Francisco District Court judge used the term more than 200 times in her 2015 ruling to uphold amateurism rules. 
As college athletic departments reel in money not only from revenue but from boosters, training facilities now surpass some professional-level gyms. USC has an underground workout field for crying out loud, but the football players on that field can’t be treated as professionals or even employees under the law. 
It is pure hypocrisy on the NCAA’s part. Demanding a strict practice schedule in these high-end facilities effectively bars athletes from functioning primarily as students, and the labor and time they are expected to devote toward their athletic endeavors assumes a higher level of competition than amateurism. 
Athletes deserve the right to unionize, bargain and ask for medical coverage from institutions that effectively control act as employers who many athletes are financially dependent on for college. 
The way athletes get to the point of employment is by challenging their label first. “Student-athlete” was never meant to be an impressive feat to put on a resume. The NCAA created the term to cover up the strain of duality that college athletes must bear while competing for and studying at universities. 
“Student-athlete” implies that there are those who can use university institutions as jumping-off points for a career, and others whose time as young adults will be used by universities for revenue. Young athletes are not legal defense jargon — they are employees of universities who deserve proper identification and rights under labor laws. 
It’s time we got rid of the “student-athlete” label and hold universities accountable for athletes’ overdue fair pay.

When USC Student Health was brought into the greater Keck School of Medicine system in 2017, 37 clinicians across the University Park and Health Sciences campuses were available as providers for more than 45,600 students. 
Leading up to the opening of the USC Psychiatry and Behavioral Health Sciences floor in the Engemann Student Health Center in November, concerns relating to student deaths, the diversity of clinician staff and the greater mental well-being of the community were continually raised in forums with student leaders and administrators. 
The Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health Sciences, led by professor and chair Dr. Steven Siegel, continually advocated for a way to refer students to long-term care without sending them through a maze of community providers and insurance guidelines, which is the national standard for student care at the university level. 
After battling the usual institutional and bureaucratic obstacles that can impede progress, construction on the fifth floor of Engemann, a year in the making, finished early and is now home to 18 clinicians. This hiring, along with the addition of 30 more clinicians in Student Health, brings a total of 85 full-time clinicians who are available and dedicated to the care of USC students. 
“I can’t impress upon you how extraordinary this is, from an institutional perspective,” Siegel said in a student media briefing. “I don’t know of any other place in the country that has put that kind of resources and support, let alone one that has been willing to nest it in the Department of Psychiatry and say, ‘This is so important to us that we’re not going to have it be separate. We’re not going to have it be outside the health system. We’re actually going to bring Student Health and a full dedicated practice for students in the department so that students have unfettered access to the highest quality care.’”
The changes come after students have noted long wait times and a required phone consultation to receive mental health services as barriers to seeking help at Engemann. In the past, students have had to wait several days or weeks in order to schedule an appointment with Student Health for their mental health needs.
With the 2020-21 school year starting in mid-August, the two practices saw almost 1,800 student visits in the month. According to Siegel, there are currently no wait times at either practice for individuals seeking out care, which has been of paramount importance to the department. 
Kelly Greco, assistant director of Outreach and Prevention Services and clinical associate professor and faculty of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, has overseen the project on advancing outreach services to meet the needs of communities on campus rather than in their individual members. Through embedded counselors introduced this year in academic departments like the School of Cinematic Arts and the Gould School of Law, and in cultural centers like La CASA and the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, these clinicians dedicate part of their week to offer their skills to the communities they serve and provide resources on coping with Zoom fatigue or seeing peers ignore public health guidelines.
“So we look at how we can go out into the community and reach individuals, especially, you know, in terms of addressing prevention, on decreasing the barriers, on decreasing the stigma, on increasing accessibility and just helping educate the community about resources, but also life skills,” Greco said. “And how do I cope with stress? How do I cope with COVID? How do I cope with the social political climate? Being online? Right, so we know there’s so many challenges right now that we’re all facing as a community.”
If students need greater care than what is provided by these embedded counselors, Greco referred them to clinical services on a short-term or group-setting basis, setting them up with psychiatric services within the USC system or in the community. For groups of students that are seeing greater separation from the campus, including international students, there are specific “Let’s Talk” workshops with times earlier and later in the day and those conducted in languages other than English to meet these needs. 
One issue in particular that is labeled as a top priority of the department, along with the burgeoning USC Institute for Addiction Science and the Haven, is substance abuse. This focus is not just following the concerns of past drug-related deaths of students, but the increasing use of substances to cope with coronavirus-related fallout. 
“We are actually recruiting and hiring therapists who specialize in substance-use disorders,” Siegel said. “We’ve made it our priority. And substance use in particular is going to be a focus of the department. Everything from, you know, media campaigns, how do we get messages out to enhance services available.”
Siegel also stressed the intentionality of the department’s hiring to meet the needs of the diverse student body. Over the past year, they have hired 50 new faculty members, with two-thirds being women, around half being people of color and one third being from marginalized communities, an initiative that he says is about “asking students who they want as much as what they want.”
While the outlook for mental health treatment may seem grim, with the pandemic increasing loneliness and stress along with instances of anxiety and depression among college students, both Siegel and Greco are confident that the department’s hiring process, which is still actively continuing, will equip the University with the resources it needs to better support its students.
“I expect moving forward, this is going to be a very, very different experience for USC students than has ever been possible before,” Siegel said.

“Unpregnant” is the coming-of-age movie all young girls need. Stellar cinematography combined with a beautifully crafted female friendship makes this picture a must watch at your next girls night. 
The film chronicles the story of a typical Missouri teen Veronica (Haley Lu Richardson) from a religious family who embarks on an quest for an abortion with her last resort, her punk rock former best friend. From the moment Veronica’s pregnancy test reads positive, she’s set on her decision to get an abortion. The only problem? In Missouri, parental consent is required.
In a moment of panic, Veronica drops the pregnancy test, and it slides out of the high school bathroom stall. Who should pick it up but Veronica’s former best friend Bailey (Barbie Ferreira), the punk rock bad girl à la Janice in “Mean Girls”? Bailey , ? Someone breaks into the grimey school bathroom, and Bailey quickly tucks the test into her pocket, later disposing of it in the dumpster where it is discovered by the recycling club. News spreads throughout the school, and in true high school fashion, the mystery of who could be pregnant must be solved. 
“Unpregnant” is also also a timely cultural commentary in the current battle for reproductive rights. The film is sure to fill your heart with angst as you root for the main character to rekindle her friendship with Bailey and get her abortion. 
Veronica returns home to find that the closest abortion clinic that doesn’t require parental consent is in Albequerquee, N.M. She finds a map and begins to plan and budget for the trip. 
Finally, the audience is introduced to the baby’s father, Kevin (Alex MacNicoll) and learns he is a major human dumpster fire who lied about the condom breaking. Kevin proposes to Veronica, and she turns him down but takes the ring to pawn and fund her abortion.  
As Bailey and Veronica embark on the trip, the bond of female friendship throughout the film is heartwarming and relatable. At the beginning, Bailey is portrayed as a grunge badass loner who drifted apart from the Ivy-League blonde Veronica. As the trip progresses, Bailey and Veronica learn to put aside their differences with a few setbacks. The emotions shown between the girls as they bond over topics like sex and sexuality are genuine for a young adult audience.
During the movie, it is clear to see a woman’s touch on direction. One memorable moment shared between the two girls is at a fairground in Texas. Veronica discovers that Bailey has a crush on a girl. The two girls board a fair ride and use the freedom of rushing wind to scream into the void and expel their feelings. 
“We’re gay and pregnant,” the girls scream.
The film is based on the young adult novel by the same title written by Jenni Hendriks and Ted Caplan. Director and screenwriter Rachel Lee Goldberg told Buzzfeed in an interview that she read the book before it was published and really resonated with Veronica since she had an abortion in her twenties. She added in multiple interviews that the driving factor of the movie is Veronica’s never questioning her need for the abortion. 
The film also pulls off a big scare by means of anti-abortion people kidnapping Bailey and Veronica after hearing their plans. In a hilarious moment, Bailey refers to the two kidnappers as “Mike Pence” and “Karen.”
The repartee in the film is witty and current. Not one of the jokes fell flat, and all of the language was relevant but not overdone. The nuance of pop culture felt natural. 
The cinematography in the film is beyond stunning. The pastel coloring of the road trip is truly awe inspiring. Regardless of your opinion on middle America, the tones of the film find a way to give it a rustic charm. 
It’s clear that Goldberg worked diligently to portray the abortion in a way that wouldn’t scare off audiences. Her decision to show it in a montage-esque way by having a voice over of the nurse describing the procedure to Veronica is simple and far from menacing. 
In the clinic Veronica makes eye contact with another young girl and the two share a soft smile. The moment is meaningful to both Veronica and the girl and provides Veronica with a sense of ease. 
“In my dream scenario, this movie doesn’t make sense to an audience in a couple years because it sounds absurd that someone would have to drive 1,000 miles to get an abortion in a country where it’s supposedly legal,” Goldberg said in the interview with Buzzfeed. “But that’s obviously not the reality right now.”
“Unpregnant” will make its cultural timestamp on this generation of women. The film does wonders to normalize reproductive rights. Goldberg’s touch as a female director brings the film to life in ways a male director never could.

While it’s easy to upload and share new music nowadays, it isn’t easy to keep your sound fresh and original. However, if you’re 21-year-old Indonesian singer-songwriter Nicole Zefanya, known professionally as NIKI, it may almost look too easy. Citing R&B influences such as Destiny’s Child and Aaliyah, the young artist emerged onto the scene only two years ago and is currently signed with Asian-based music collective 88rising. Despite previously leaning more into R&B-inspired music, NIKI’s sound almost entirely evolves in her debut album, “Moonchild.”
A product of NIKI’s evolving personal maturity, “Moonchild” experiments with new sonic and visual aesthetics while maintaining her songwriter’s roots. The album’s first single, “Switchblade,” took fans by surprise as the artist premiered new white, moon-like hair and heavy pop-synth beats in her glittery, otherworldly music video. While not her most traditionally catchy or thematically profound track, it pairs the softer, breathy elements of NIKI’s voice with deep, heart-pumping synths to declare her love and excitement for new adventures and environments. Shocking, extraterrestrial and beautiful, “Switchblade” announced a dramatic transition from the parking-lot music videos of NIKI’s earlier projects and showed that “Moonchild” would be unlike anything she’s released before.
While other tracks return to her R&B-inclined tones, many still demonstrate thematic and sonic maturity. “Selene,” the album’s second single, plays with a funky, sexy bassline and introduces an even sexier alter-ego who’s “taken over” all sense of inhibition, according to the song’s lyrics. Tracks including “Wide Open” and “Tide” may also come as a surprise to longtime fans of NIKI, as her experimentation with dark, slinky spoken-word and rap verses — a music style not unlike that recently popularized by Billie Eilish — differs dramatically from the romantic, lighthearted R&B tunes early in her career. Both introduce two of the three “Phases” in the album and build on its mysterious and experimental aesthetic.
“Pandemonium,” the sixth track off the record, opts for a mellow lo-fi mood and rolls over you like you’re watching the ocean waves at night — a perfect addition to your night-vibe playlist. Meanwhile, “Plot Twist” touches on the magic of finding unexpected love in the story of life. Optimistic, harmonious vocals and playful lyrics like, “Between the wishbones and dot-dot-dots / There was always gonna be you and I,” makes this song feel as if it was giddily spinning off of a teenager’s diary page.
The album includes some deeply emotional tracks as well. Stripped down to emotive vocals, acoustic instrumentals and devastating lyrics, “Lose” has already made ripples in the online music community. A haunting melody follows NIKI’s journey of coming to terms with a fading love, she sings, “I don’t need a reason / To keep on dreamin’ / That we don’t lose, yeah, what’s the use?” On her Twitter page, she even revealed the song was recorded in one take: “Everything was kept & unchanged: every breath, every imperfection, the push-and-pull rapport with the piano. The same way we all tend to keep holding on to what is familiar… out of comfort, out of fear, out of fierce allegiance — all whilst unknowingly easing into the poison.”
Several other songs also feature notably moving themes. Slow, vulnerable and dramatic, NIKI’s vocals soar over a heavy, soul-stirring beat in “If There’s Nothing Left…” Think of a dramatic scene of two love interests crying together after a movie’s climax, and this song would definitely be playing. The album’s closer, “Drive On,” ends our journey through “Moonchild” with quiet contentment. Sampling a ’60s drum rhythm, it epitomizes the album sonically with its creative sampling of retro, acoustic and experimental instruments and harmonious, twisty vocals. Like the tired stillness of the ocean after a hurricane, “Drive On” concludes “Moonchild” by driving away from the storm into a soft, tranquil ending: “’Cause the beasts have scattered / Our story stains the ground / The bloodbath’s over now / So drive on.”
Dramatic, experimental and ethereal, “Moonchild” signifies notable growth and maturity in NIKI as an artist. Compared with her previous work of singles and EPs, this album’s use of creative sampling, mystical world-building and empathetic lyrics make it not just a captivating 34-minute listen, but also a declaration of serious artistry from its narrator. While those partial to NIKI’s songwriter roots may feel disappointed by the album’s emphasis on sonic aesthetics, it’s exciting to see her branching out of her comfort zone and fully embracing the bold, cross-genre aesthetic freedom that’s been successfully paved by highly acclaimed artists such as Billie Eilish and Lorde. Only the first album in NIKI’s discography, it’s safe to say that “Moonchild” is just the beginning for this gifted young artist.

On Aug. 31, Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies shot Dijon Kizzee for allegedly breaking a bike law. Kizzee’s death has prompted demonstrations throughout L.A. County and tough conversations about the role of the police. Racism in law enforcement has existed in the United States since its inception, and this tragedy is one of the latest in a long string of extrajudicial police killings of Black people. 
For too many people of color, getting the police involved is a death sentence. It’s time for civilians to question why they rely on the law enforcement to solve their problems.
Despite bearing the motto “to protect and serve,” law enforcement agents have no legal responsibility to ensure civilian safety. The U.S. Supreme Court found in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services (1989) and Castle Rock v. Gonzales (2005) that the government has no constitutional duty to protect people from harm. The law is clear: Police officers are not bodyguards.
Police officers may not even arrive quickly enough to prevent personal injury. While the Los Angeles Police Department’s average response time is 5.7 minutes, most response times are notoriously variable, dependent on city-specific factors and how life-threatening the situation is. However, most criminal-victim interactions only take 90 seconds. 
Moreover, police officers are trained to engage in, not prevent, conflict. A 2016 Department of Justice study of 135,000 police trainees found that 168 out of 840 hours of training were spent on firearms, self-defense and use of force. Mental illness received only 10 hours and issues such as homelessness and substance abuse were often neglected.
Police training also inculcates a siege mentality within officers, teaching them that they are always at risk of attack. Police departments often screen the killing of Kirk Dinkheller, an officer who was killed after hesitating to shoot a suspect, to teach cadets that violence is inevitable. Many also host “warrior-style” training sessions, which prepare officers to kill without any hesitation.
Of course, the vast majority of police officers care deeply about the communities they serve. But when police training and responsibilities do not account for civilian safety, it is clear that police officers are primarily intended to act as agents of violence. It is unreasonable to assume that calling the police will automatically make the situation better.
If anything, police violence may make the situation worse. In 2013, grandmother Carolyn Wade called police to talk down her granddaughter from running away; the officer on duty manhandled Wade’s pregnant daughter and handcuffed her granddaughter. When Wade protested, the officer slammed her head into a wall.
When law enforcement officers make mistakes, the results are deadly. They may enter the wrong house, which was the case in the 2014 killing of Jerry Waller or, more recently, the 2020 killing of Breonna Taylor. They may also misidentify the criminals, which was the case with the 2014 killing of Daniel Martin Jr.
Whether or not these mistakes are common (which they are) is irrelevant — police violence has too much potential to traumatize or even kill innocent people. These risks detract from public safety, defeating the purpose of calling the police.
Even with the best intentions, requesting police involvement has resulted in unnecessary deaths. On Aug. 22, police officers shot and killed parole officer Sandy Guardiola after her colleagues called 911 to request a wellness check. This isn’t an isolated incident — “wellness checks” have been killing Black people since at least 2011.
Wellness check-related police violence disproportionately impacts those experiencing mental health issues. Given the aforementioned lack of mental health training, officers are highly likely to interpret atypical behavior as life-threatening and to respond with extreme prejudice. The result is that at least half of police shootings involve people with mental illness.
Given that police involvement inherently opens the possibility of violence and death, civilians must reevaluate what constitutes a legitimate reason to call 911. Of course, the police should be involved when someone is posing a direct threat to themselves or to others. That being said, it is self-defeating to risk misdirected violence to resolve interpersonal conflict or property loss.
If the situation is not life-threatening, alternative conflict resolution methods will likely be more helpful in reaching a resolution. Short-term solutions include using de-escalation tactics or leaving the situation until emotions cool over. Long-term solutions might include building relationships with neighbors or even investing time and resources into a community mediation group, along with reallocating funding from law enforcement to community resources.
Regardless of the situation at hand, calling the police should be a last, not first, course of action.

Welcome to The Principle’s Office! As a philosophy, politics and law major with a particular interest in philosophy, I often wonder what abstract ideas are woven into the fabric of many hot-button topics. What principles underlie these issues, if any? What ought they be? What are the nature of these things? Why is this that and why isn’t that this? 
These are the questions that I seek to explore with this column and hope you might come to enjoy. So without further ado and in the spirit of these concepts, I believe the ACT to be a big billowing bowl of bullshit, and I am happy that the UC system has decided to stop mandating standardized test scores in their admissions process. 
From a bird’s eye view, it is clear that the skills needed to succeed on this exam are not analogous to much else. On average, one’s ACT score is evidenced to likely increase as one repeatedly takes the test. Students often submit only their best test scores and can repeatedly take the test over whatever increment of time they deem necessary. 
Though I have received extensions and make-ups in my academic career, I cannot say that I have been in a situation that allowed me to retake an exam as many times as I needed nor have I been afforded the opportunity to exclusively focus on succeeding at an exam for as long as I felt necessary. Without examining the test closely, it is already clear that this kind of idiosyncratic exam measures one’s abilities in a very narrow range of situations, so narrow that they are not even mimicked in most other spheres of academia, let alone the world at large. 
My personal experience with the exam was overall negative. As a Canadian first-generation college student, I was completely unfamiliar with how to go about succeeding on the ACT, and I was under no pressure from my family to take the test seriously. In fact, my family members would consistently refer to the exam as my “CAT.” 
I was 17 years old, an accomplished high school debater, a member of Model United Nations, co-student body president and a longstanding member of the academic honor roll at my school. My track record reflected my scholastic strategy; I had seized every academic opportunity and I had reached tirelessly for mastery in my fields of study. I dreamed of boarding the SS ScholarShip, and I wanted to ride it all the way to a profession. 
Realizing that all my friends had taken the ACT multiple times and paid thousands of dollars for prep courses before I even knew what the acronym stood for made me feel like my dream boat had sailed off. At that point, none of the skills I had honed in on during my high school career would help me conquer the ACT, despite having helped me conquer all past academia-related challenges. It was as though everyone else’s parents had bought them tickets, packed their bags and organized the itineraries for their trip on the now-tired SS ScholarShip metaphor. If I wanted to catch up, I would have to dive into the ocean and swim up to the boat myself. 
In the eleventh hour, during the height of my senior-year stress, I ended up taking the only ACT that could be completed prior to most university application deadlines and sent my score in blind. The sinking feeling of isolation and powerlessness prompted by standardized testing is familiar to many ambitious and well-accomplished first-generation college students. It was sobering to realize that because of my failure to be entirely self-sufficient and independently proactive about standardized testing at 17 years old, I would not be able to achieve my lifelong and life-changing university dreams. 
Many of my non-first-generation peers, on the other hand, did not have to be burdened with mapping out this complex ACT maze on their own, nor did they have to independently motivate themselves to succeed. For the most part, their parents signed them up for multiple test dates a full year in advance, enrolled them in fancy preparatory programs and consistently reminded them how important standardized tests were. 
Explicit and particular knowledge on how to do well on a specific standardized exam, access to special test resources and pressure to succeed were all things I was comparatively lacking as a first-generation college student. All this to say, one’s ACT score, and subsequently one’s academic future, is largely contingent on the nature of the family one is born into despite the ability of a 17-year-old teenager to reach into themselves and pull out intense amounts of discipline, costly resources and a very specific wherewithal. 
There is clear systemic oppression at work, and that is the very problem with using the exam as a tool to decide who gets a quality education. The nature of intelligence and the ability to succeed is so elusive that no one measure has the monopoly on the proper metric for either. For instance, we can easily find swaths of successful high-school dropouts, and we can also find herds of unemployed university graduates. The operationalization of the variable that is success is clearly not as simple as doing one single thing really well, let alone an exam. 
It is time for institutions of higher learning to stop reducing students to some arbitrary purported metric of, according to ACT’s website, students’ “ability to complete college-level work” and “general educational development” and actually do their job, think critically and look at predictors and assessments of success in a more holistic and accurate way. By continuing to use standardized tests as a significant factor in college admissions, universities are producing a system that most heavily rewards, at worst, the birth lottery or at best, a very specific kind of skill, that of taking the ACT or SAT, that is frankly so stupid.
