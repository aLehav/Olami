If this year’s MLB Draft were at its usual full length of 40 rounds, USC’s six players ranked in Baseball America’s top 500 draft prospects would have had the program poised to make quite the splash in the 2020 event. 
But because of the coronavirus pandemic, the most recent installment of the draft lasted only five rounds, and rising senior right-handed pitcher Kyle Hurt was the lone Trojan to be selected over the course of the two-day draft. Hurt, Baseball America’s No. 135 prospect, fell Thursday at No. 134 overall — the 27th-to-last pick — to the Miami Marlins in the final round. 
“We were in the fifth round yesterday and my thought was, ‘Who’s the player here that’s here and is extremely undervalued?’” Marlins Director of Amateur Scouting DJ Svihlik said Friday in a virtual press conference. “Kyle Hurt, at times — and we’re in the fifth round, at times — has as good of stuff as the five players or better than the guys we drafted ahead of him. He’s that good.”
Hurt had a somewhat enigmatic college career. After being drafted in the 34th round of the 2017 draft by the Philadelphia Phillies — a knee injury and USC commitment lowered the top-100 prospect’s draft stock — Hurt elected to go the college route and play at USC. He struggled to the tune of a 4.76 ERA in his freshman year and a 5.69 mark his sophomore year. Hurt was beginning to flip the script during his junior year, posting a 3.71 ERA with a .190 opponent’s batting average through four starts before the season was shut down by the pandemic. 
But Miami is betting on Hurt’s stuff to pay dividends in the professional scene. He boasts a 92- to 94-mph fastball that tops out at 97 mph, and he adds a changeup that scouts believe could develop into a plus pitch. The two pitches each grade as a 55 on MLB’s 20-80 scale, and he also throws a slider and curveball that scouts pegged as a 50 and a 40, respectively. 
“Kyle Hurt was outstanding this year,” Svihlik said. “He really turned the corner with a new coaching staff at USC. He struggled with the previous staff, so you take the bet on the player with the real talent, the real major-league talent and body and pitch package.”
Hurt has often struggled with command in his college career, walking 58 batters in 81.1 innings his freshman year, 41 batters in 74.1 innings his sophomore year and eight through 17 innings this year. Hurt’s command grades out as a below-average 45 on MLB’s 20-80 scale. 
Regardless, Hurt’s 6-foot-3, 215-pound frame and his upside make him an intriguing prospect for Miami. The Marlins finished 57-105 last year, the worst record in the National League and the third-worst record in MLB. However, in March, MLB.com ranked Miami’s the fourth-best farm system in baseball, a group Hurt will hope to bolster should he forgo his final two years of college eligibility and enter Miami’s ranks. 
No. 122 rising senior infielder and outfielder Jamal O’Guinn, No. 325 rising senior shortstop Ben Ramirez, No. 343 rising junior first baseman Clay Owens, No. 357 rising senior left-handed pitcher John Beller and No. 423 rising junior right-handed pitcher Chandler Champlain are the five other Trojans that made Baseball America’s Top 500. Though they were not selected in the draft, they will be able to sign with teams for signing bonuses up to $20,000 as undrafted free agents.

The Von Kleinsmid Center will temporarily be renamed The Center for International and Public Affairs as USC removes its former title, President Carol Folt announced in a communitywide email Thursday. The change follows months of petitions and scrutiny stemming from former University President Rufus von KleinSmid’s status as a known eugenicist. 
“This moment is our Call to Action, a call to confront anti-Blackness and systemic racism, and unite as a diverse, equal, and inclusive university,” the email read. “You have asked for actions, not rhetoric, and actions, now.”
The Board of Trustees executive committee voted unanimously to remove the name and bust of von KleinSmid Wednesday night. The renaming comes more than a year after former Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael Quick announced the formation of a nomenclature committee February 2019 comprising students, faculty and staff. 
“He expanded research, academic programs, and curriculum in international relations,” Folt said of von KleinSmid. “But, he was also an active supporter of eugenics and his writings on the subject are at direct odds with USC’s multicultural community and our mission of diversity and inclusion.” 
The email also announced the implementation of an advisory board for the Department of Public Safety, five years after its recommendation from the Provost’s Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion. To be composed of faculty, staff, students and members of the surrounding campus community, the board will be led by Provost Charles Zukoski and report directly to Folt on safety protocol, policing and engagement with the community on- and off-campus. Folt also said the board, which she hopes will materialize in a matter of weeks, will examine DPS’ relationship with the Los Angeles Police Department and its history of racial and identity profiling. 
The Task Force on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, formed in 2015, which recommended more than 20 action items though few were implemented, will also be expanded to include new members of students, faculty and staff. The new committee will aid the taskforce in identifying structural and institutional bases of inequality on campus and developing initiatives such as mandatory implicit bias training and sensitivity and course offerings on racism. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Folt said the taskforce will also evaluate student demands on defunding DPS and cutting ties with the LAPD. 
“[These are] decisions that need to be done in consultation with people, and I personally believe what we want is a wonderful, safe environment with great community engagement,” Folt said in the interview. “We want to do it in the best possible way, and I think we lead with our mission, and then we take the actions necessary to get it.” 
Folt also wrote that Zukoski and Senior Vice President of Human Resources Felicia Washington will spearhead the search for a Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, a position the University aims to fill by fall. 
In addition, Folt wrote that she has tasked Washington to work with the community to develop an online Mandatory Unconscious Bias Training program for Fall 2020. 
“We urgently need training to raise awareness of conscious and unconscious biases,” her email read.
Spaces for underrepresented students will also be created on two floors of the Student Union in the fall as part of Vice President of Student Affairs Winston Crisp’s multi-year initiative to expand on-campus and cultural community spaces including for Black, Latinx and LGBTQ students, Folt announced. USC will also launch First Generation Plus, a program to provide resources to first generation, spring, transfer and undocumented students.
In the interview with the Daily Trojan, Folt said she has been attempting to enact these changes to campus since her inauguration but has dedicated significant attention to addressing the issues created by the coronavirus pandemic. As the University makes the transition to return to on-campus living, Folt looks to continue to address anti-Blackness with the advice from diversity committees and other advisers. 
“It’s pretty critical for a leader not to lead with their chin but to bring people with them and lead with the things that are going to take real action, and can avoid the mistakes of the past,” Folt said in the interview. “You always wish you could do more and do it faster and do it better, but I really do think we’re in a really good position to act quickly.”
Folt’s letter comes after criticism of her previous email May 31, with many students calling it a performative gesture acknowledging the killing of George Floyd and other Black victims at the hands of police brutality with no administrative action. Following the email, students called on the University to address and acknowledge racism on and off-campus, to cut ties with the LAPD and to rename VKC via a Black Lives Matter solidarity march Saturday. Petitions from students such as rising senior Jephtha Prempeh and letters from campus organizations including the Black Student Assembly and USC Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation made similar demands. 
According to Folt, these are the first of several actions the University will implement to address racist institutions and structures and support its Black and marginalized communities. 
“This is a long journey, and it’s going to take a lot of commitment,” Folt told the Daily Trojan. “It’s a chance for us to really get a good look but start taking actions pretty precipitously with as broad involvement as possible. And if we do that, a month from now, it’ll be better, and two months from now, it’ll be better. And I think that’s the point … to keep moving forward, involving people and making actions that can get us moving ahead.”
