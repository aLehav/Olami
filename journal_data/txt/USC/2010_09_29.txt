Microlending website Kiva will now expand its program to grant loans to college students across the world, and USC’s own Kiva chapter plans to help make that happen.
Lenders can now give as little as $25 to students in Paraguay, Lebanon and Bolivia and give them the opportunity to gain essential skills through higher education or vocational training.
The members of Kiva@USC plan to promote this goal by explaining to other students just how easy it is to get involved and help those in need.
“Kiva empowers all of those who are involved in the process,” said Raheem Parpia, the founder of Kiva@USC. “I know people at USC who will spend $25 at the 9-0 [Bar & Grill] in one night. Why not put that money toward a cause that honestly saves the lives of the people that receive these loans?”
Kiva@USC is particularly enthusiastic about the new decision to expand loans to college students, Parpia said.
“You’re taking two important aspects — giving loans to people who will use them in the best possible way and the opportunity for an education — and combining the two together,” Parpia said. “Education is the most important thing for a person who wants to be financially independent, so I’m glad that Kiva is recognizing this and reacting to it.”
Kiva traditionally provides an online medium for people to offer loans to aspiring small business owners in impoverished nations. Lenders can log on to the website and browse through different profiles and decide on whom to loan their money.  Now, that decision will be extended to college students.
Shaked Peleg, the current president of Kiva@USC, said he has come up with numerous ways of getting the word out about the organization.
“We had a ‘Kiva Takeover’ last semester where we set up booths on McCarthy Quad and in Alumni Park representing the different businesses that we have helped lend money to,” said Paleg, a sophomore majoring in economics and international relations.
Last year, Kiva@USC raised approximately $13,000 in loans, surpassing the original goal of $10,000.
The club often works with local restaurants to raise money for the organization.
“We worked with a USC alumni-based restaurant, Wurstkuche, in Downtown Los Angeles where on one night 15 percent of their revenue went towards Kiva@USC,” Parpia said.
Raheem Parpia, the former president of Kiva@USC and a 2010 graduate of USC, founded the club in the spring of 2009 after learning about Kiva while doing research for a paper for an international relations class.
“At first, I was taken aback as to why I had never heard of this concept before. I thought to myself, ‘Why isn’t this a more popular idea?’” Parpia said. “So I started this club as a conscious effort to encourage students to connect to and help those who didn’t have the same privileges as them.”
Alexandra Cook, a senior majoring in broadcast journalism, said she believed donating to Kiva provided a way for college students to get involved with bigger world issues.
“I think it’s a great opportunity for USC students to give back to others who are less fortunate than them,” Cook said. “I think people are afraid to give money to organizations like this because if they don’t have a lot to donate, they feel like it’s not worth it. If everyone just gave $5 it could make an amazing difference in someone’s life.”
To date, Kiva has lent almost $163 million to entrepreneurs in 207 countries.

After a 35-year-long career of fundraising for universities across the country, Albert Checcio, the new senior vice president for University Advancement, plans to uphold President C.L. Max Nikias’ vision for the future of USC by expanding the university’s fundraising campaign.

Checcio, who joined the USC staff on Aug. 23, will be responsible for working with Nikias, the Board of Trustees and academic deans to increase overall fundraising. He plans to ensure that alumni feel connected to the university, while also orchestrating fundraising efforts and procuring donations.
“My goals are simply to support the academic endeavors of the university. We have a brand-new president, a dynamic person,” Checcio said. “[Nikias’] goals and vision is to take USC to the top of the mountain academically. My job is to run a fundraising campaign that provides the financial support for that to happen.”
In addition to leading traditional fundraising, Checcio will also head the USC Alumni Association, said Elizabeth Garrett, interim senior vice president for academic affairs and provost, who will work closely with Checcio.
“He has the responsibility for making sure that all of the Trojan Family, once they leave, feels connected to the institution,” Garrett said. “He’s someone who has a lot of energy, and he has a very sophisticated background in modern fundraising.”
Checcio’s fundraising endeavors will benefit new building projects, endowments for professors and new research. His diverse background will help him achieve his goals in raising private support for the university, he said.
Checcio’s background spans a 35-year career in collegiate fundraising. Checcio has worked at a variety of universities, most notably Fordham University, American University and Temple University, where Checcio increased cash giving by 94 percent during a five-year period.
During his previous seven years at Fordham University, where he served as vice president of development and university relations, Checcio raised more than $335 million, $59 million of which was raised in 2009 alone.
Now at USC, Checcio plans to continue his record of success.
“There is a fantastic spirit that is on this campus … I can sense it because I’ve been on other campuses all over the United States and the world,” Checcio said. “Unquestionably, when you get to the top of the mountain, you want to make sure that you stay there and that your peers recognize that you belong there, and that’s what I think I can build on.”
Checcio, a Pennsylvania native and lifelong East Coast resident, believes that his diverse background at universities of varied sizes and dynamics can help him further the university’s a vision of academic and artistic excellence — but not without some challenges along the way.
“For me to make this change and come to a university like ’SC is a learning experience for me. It’s pushing my own boundaries a bit, culturally, professionally and personally,” he said.
Though pushing his boundaries, Checcio doesn’t feel the anxiety that one might experience after moving across the country. Being “new” to USC has a special meaning to him.
“It’s very easy to be a part of the Trojan Family,” Checcio said. “There is a level of pride here that you don’t find anywhere else, and I want to take that pride and spirit and focus it and direct it into helping ’SC be the best in higher education.”

Scientists at USC’s Keck School of Medicine have discovered that faults in the same genetic region can contribute to the causes of both ovarian and breast cancer, suggesting a link between the developments of the two diseases.
Published online Sept. 19 in the journal Nature Genetics, the study looked at the “genetic basis of cancer causation,” said Jonathan Samet, chair of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Keck.
“This involved looking at the genes in people with cancer in comparison to the genes in people without [it],” Samet said.
Simon Gayther, who joined USC in early September and spearheaded the study, worked with colleagues from Keck’s Department of Preventive Medicine, including Susan Ramus, Anna Wu and Celeste Leigh Pearce, among others.
They looked at the genetic information of roughly 13,000 subjects, seeking to find common genetic factors within the population that could be responsible for causing ovarian cancer. The intent was to find a link between a genetic factor that appears more in a cancer patient, which would be less common in a healthy patient, Gayther said.
They discovered five new genetic factors that increase a woman’s chance of developing ovarian cancer.
Since the mid-1990s, scientists have understood that some cancers travel together. In other words, a woman may develop ovarian cancer and breast cancer in quick succession, Gayther said.
What his study now suggests is that some common genetic variants interact with one another in patients at high risk for cancer.
“If you take the woman who has a fault in one gene and on top of that has a fault in another region of the gene [that causes] ovarian cancer, that woman has a much higher risk of getting breast cancer,” Gayther said.
Women who have variations of these gene patterns in their DNA could thus benefit from being screened for both types of cancer simultaneously, which could lead to better forms of cancer prevention.
Gayther has worked on ovarian cancer research throughout his career. He described the disease as a particularly aggressive one that has lacked sufficient scientific research and awareness.
“It is a particularly nasty disease that is very hard to detect, especially early on,” Gayther said.
The positive impacts that research and medical advances have had on understanding breast cancer during the past 20 years are what inspired Gayther’s pursuit to study ovarian cancer, which he said has not benefited from the same improvements.
“When a woman gets a diagnosis, she is almost given a long-term death sentence,” Gayther said. “Seventy percent [of diagnosed women] will be dead within five years. It’s not the most common cancer in the world, but the fact that very few survive means it causes a lot of deaths.”
Samet said he was pleased with the research conducted by Gayther and his colleagues, saying it represents much of the breakthrough work typical of Keck faculty.
“The research has received some publicity. What’s important are the next steps,” Samet said. “[Future breakthroughs] bring the possibility of early detection and possibly therapeutic approaches.”
Gayther said he has essentially moved his entire ovarian cancer program that he started in London to USC, and will soon begin teaching classes in genetics and public health.
“My main interest will be trying to develop young people [by bringing them] into the lab and turning them into really good scientists,” he said.
Both Gayther and Samet emphasized the significant role this research will play in the lives of USC students. Although this research is time-consuming, the benefits are bound to influence the way society understands cancer and the resources it will have to combat it, they said.
Gayther remained optimistic about future developments and encouraged the university to continue supporting research that will enhance the ability to fight and eliminate diseases such as cancer.
“Until we get to a stage where we are able to [better] understand and cure diseases and there isn’t this big fear that we could one day be sick,” he said, “we have to keep motivating ourselves to solve these problems.”

Proposition 19, or the Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010, is one ballot initiative that Californians will vote on this November that some students say does not polarize the left or right political sides.
If passed, the initiative would make the possession and sale of marijuana to people over the age of 21 legal in the state.
“Prop 19 affects all genders, race, classes, professions, political parties, and California citizens are coming together to support Prop 19,” said Elizabeth Tauro, leader of the Yes on 19 campaign on campus. “If nothing else, it’s something that’s going to truly affect so many people, more than the ideology of politicians.”
Given the condition of California’s economy, some think the legalization of marijuana would be a good source of revenue for the cash-strapped state.
“There is a huge misconception out there that Republicans are automatically against Prop 19,” said Katherine Cook, chairwoman of USC’s College Republicans. “There isn’t any hard-and-fast party line on Prop 19 for Democrats or Republicans. Many high-profile Democrats and Republicans alike oppose Prop 19, including Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown … This is not a Democrat or Republican issue.”
Jonathan Brebner, president of USC’s College Democrats, agreed, noting that although many young Democrats support the proposition, Democrats in general are not more likely to be in favor of legalizing marijuana.
“I know there are many people on the right who tend to have a less restrictive view on personal liberty and view this as a matter of personal liberty,” Brebner said. “There’s no significant public benefit to making the use of marijuana illegal and a lot of public benefit to legalizing it and regulating it. I think the larger element would probably be based on age.”
Brebner said older voters are more likely to be against legalization than younger voters, but even this is not a set distinction.
The state of the economy, more than anything, is what will affect the way people vote — and that could mean more support for the ballot initiative, Brebner said.
“It could potentially be a good source of revenue at a time when we desperately need new sources of revenue and money for the budget,” Brebner said.
The Yes on 19 campaign also stressed the importance of the proposition for economic growth of the state.
“The campaign is going to have a huge effect on the economy today,” Tauro said. “Hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are being spent enforcing the failed prohibition of cannabis and it’s created a violent crime market led by international drug cartels.”
The California State Board of Equalization estimates that the legal sale of marijuana could generate $1.4 billion a year in tax revenue while saving $300 million in enforcement costs. Estimates from the board show that $14 billion in illegal sales occur annually, from which the state receives nothing.
Some students on campus agree that the legalization of marijuana is an issue that should be addressed.
“I definitely think it should be on the ballot,” said Christopher Rivera, a senior majoring in fine arts, “but at this point, I honestly don’t know how I’m voting.”
Regardless, Brebner said, Prop 19 could affect legislation across the country.
“A lot of other states will be watching this closely,” Brebner said.
“There is a huge misconception out there that Republicans are automatically against Prop 19,” …
WHAT!? That’s not a misconception. According to the most recent California field poll, 66% of Republicans are stupid enough to vote against their own freedom, and continue down the road of prohibition — knowing full well that it’s un-American, destructive, wasteful, and futile.
On the other hand, only 28% of Democrats are that stupid, with 12% undecided about how dumb they are.
Making the assumption that republicans are against their own freedom is a fairly safe bet.
Don’t be an idiot. VOTE YES ON PROP 19
Should be interesting to see what happens should this proposition pass.  CA is not the only governing body with a voice in this debate.  On the federal level marijuana is a controlled substance.  Federal law supersedes state law (US Constitution, Article VI).
Jesus said to treat other people the way we would want to be treated. I know I wouldn’t want any student to go to jail with the sexual predators, or my parents to have their house stolen by the police, if they used a little marijuana.  
Let’s change the world. Let’s get registered and vote.
Citizens and college students in California can register at
 w w w . sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_vr.htm .
(just fill out the form and mail it in).  
And  you can request a ballot by mail at
 w w w . sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_m.htm  .
In other states, Google your state name and the phrase, voter registration. Print off the form and mail it in (or drive it down to City Hall).  
Five minutes. Register to vote. Change the world. Right now.
Pass it on
“Democrats in general are not more likely to be in favor of legalizing marijuana”
This is completely false according to the polling data.

Fresh off its 2010 Grammy win for Best New Artist, Zac Brown Band has proven that it can live up to that title with the release of its fourth album, You Get What You Give. A few critics — and just a few — have written off the album as a clichéd country jumble of feel-good songs about cold beer, simplicity and escaping the problems of everyday life in favor of hedonism. Clearly those few did not give the album the listen it deserves.
You Get What You Give is an album full of what are indeed upbeat, breezy and laid-back songs, but there are a handful of songs that go a level deeper as well. Although Zac Brown uses plain language, the songs are straightforward, not unrefined.

It’s a solid listen; the songs are enjoyable, the instrumentals are excellent and the musical palette is a diverse one full of influence from other genres, ultimately making for an album that steps out of the contemporary country box without losing its roots.
Many of the songs like “No Hurry,” “Settle Me Down” and the opening number “Let It Go,” which starts off with a surf-rock vibe, are buoyant and cheerful. “Knee Deep” offers escapism and daydreams of paradise with lyrics like “Gonna put the world away for a minute / pretend I don’t live in it / sunshine gonna wash my blues away.”
Keeping with the album’s general trend of jubilance, “Whiskey’s Gone” kicks it up a notch. In fact, it’s downright peppy. Full of energy and just shy of being crude, it’s nothing but pure fun. Another plus is that it sounds the most country out of all the songs.
The album occasionally deviates from its generally upbeat vibe with more mellow songs like “Cold Hearted” and the fantastic ballad “Colder Weather,” which tells the story of a rambling man torn between the road and the one he loves.
“Quiet Your Mind,” however, is the one slow song that seems to stick out — and not in a good way. Although it’s not a bad song per se, it sounds like what a Pearl Jam tribute band would come up with after watching Across the Universe three times in a row and then deciding that it wanted to try its hand at a country song. It just doesn’t fit.
Despite the fact that “Quiet Your Mind” is conspicuous in an out-of-place way, for the most part the album is consistent; it doesn’t feel disjointed and the songs that gently mix genres happen to work. The song “Keep Me In Mind” has obvious R&B and soul influences that come in during the bridge and compliment the “boy wants girl, but girl is taken” romantic theme of the song.
“Colder Weather,” “As She’s Walking Away” and “Martin” are the songs that give the album its backbone. “As She’s Walking Away” is an all-around solid song with a catchy melody (and some sappy lyrics to go with it).
But the most compelling song on the album is definitely the slow number “Martin,” which Zac Brown wrote about his guitar and the part that music has played in his life. The concept of “you get what you give” is clearest in this song as Brown claims that it’s up to the players whether or not the music they make is real or just noise.
The album ends on a high note with the honky-tonk number “Make This Day,” which is nice, considering that artists often toss a weaker song into the last slot. But listeners shouldn’t be fooled; although the last song is simple and fun, the album has a respectable amount of substance.
Zac Brown Band has proven that it is more than just a country band. There’s a little something for all types of country and non-country listeners on You Get What You Give. It also contains superbly executed instrumentals that deserve separate recognition, whether it’s the steel guitar, mandolin, fiddle or bass guitar.
It’s clear that the band put a lot of effort and enjoyment into making this album, and if you really get what you give, Zac Brown Band only has more success coming their way.

For a guy who once made a film where the main character talked out of his butt, Tom Shadyac is surprisingly insightful. The director of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Liar, Liar and Evan Almighty cites environmentalist Daniel Quinn and philosopher Noam Chomsky among his influences, and seems to have a neverending list of favorite writers, including A Wrinkle in Time author Madeleine L’Engle and the Sufi mystic Hafez.
Considering that, it might not be so surprising that Shadyac’s new film I Am — his first foray into the world of documentaries — tries to find an answer to all of the world’s problems.
“I went out and asked two questions,” Shadyac said. “What’s wrong with our world, and what can we do about it? And when I ask what’s wrong with our world I don’t want to hear the common answer.”
Some of the answers he received did not please him.
“‘Oh, we’re destroying the environment.’ ‘Oh, we’re always at war.’ ‘Oh, there’s so much poverty, so much economic disparity.’ Those are the symptoms,” he said. “I wanted to have a conversation about the root problems. What causes these things?”
In 2007, Shadyac was involved in a bicycle accident that gave the lifelong surfer, biker and outdoorsman his fifth or sixth concussion. With this concussion, however, the symptoms didn’t go away. His doctors diagnosed him with post-concussion syndrome. Light and sound were painful to endure; his only real solace came in quiet, dark rooms. Shadyac feared he was facing death.
“I asked the question to myself, ‘If this is it for me, what do I want to do before I go?’” Shadyac said. “I wanted to explore some things that I had become aware of, that I had woken up to in my life. I had a conversation sitting in me that wasn’t happening in the larger world. And I didn’t want to die with that conversation inside of me.”
After he had healed, Shadyac and a camera crew asked 18 people, in various fields, including himself, his two questions. Quinn and Chomsky made it into the film, as did the late historian Howard Zinn, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and alternative scientist Dean Radin.
Being his first documentary, I Am posed new challenges for Shadyac. He was accustomed to writing and planning a film before shooting it. With a documentary, it’s the opposite. The film’s shot, then the story is shaped during editing.
“I didn’t know what it would turn into. It turned into a very positive, very uplifting film,” Shadyac said. “That didn’t evolve until we went on this journey. You have to follow your interviews. They’re your scripts — the people you talk to, the moments you uncovered.”
In some ways, though, this is old hat for Shadyac. Most of his characters, particularly in Patch Adams and Bruce Almighty, either want or have to change the world for the better. The lessons are often simple: love thy neighbor; the truth shall set you free; simple acts of kindness make the biggest differences. In some ways, he’s a modern-day Frank Capra.
“There’s been kind of an evolving message in the films I do. I like to think of them as parables. Each one stands for something,” Shadyac said. “Even something as silly as Ace Ventura is really rooted in the idea of a childlike joy, which I think is spiritual.”
That mission has gained Shadyac a reputation as a Christian filmmaker, even though he’s never quite labeled himself as such.
“I don’t consider any film that I’ve done to be targeted towards any specific religious audience. I do films about things that move me. I want any film to be appealing to people of various faiths, whether you’re a Buddhist or of a Judaic faith,” Shadyac said. “I find a commonality between all my major faiths, and my films try to meet that commonality. It’s not about this dogma that calls you a Christian, or a Jew, or a Hindu or a Muslim. I want to get beneath that.”
For Shadyac, that also means exploring both science and faith in I Am, areas that many consider mutually exclusive.
“I think if you have this belief about a creative force, that when you look at the science and really explore it, it does nothing but blow your mind and increase your belief,” Shadyac said. “I just always want to know what’s true, and this movie is really an exploration of some ideas of what may be true about who we are as people and what the basic fundamental nature of reality may be.”

Whenever a film screams the message “Based on a true story” across the screen, there is immediately a certain indescribable intimacy between the audience and the characters portrayed within the movie.
Adaptation · Kyle Patrick Alvarez (left) and William Wheeler discussed writing stories within the boundaries of real-life events. - Wei Shen | Daily Trojan
Whether it is the violence captured on the shores of a World War II battle scene or the recreation of an intimate real-life love story, these “true” adaptations draw the viewers naturally into the fabric of the lives and the cinematic world. But how much of what is presented on the screen actually true? And moreover, when it comes to art, what is truth anyway?
On Tuesday evening, the USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences and the Master of Professional Writing Program put together “Based on a True Story: Hollywood Screenwriters on the Art of Dramatizing Real Life,” a panel of Hollywood screenwriters to discuss and answer exactly those questions.
The discussion was moderated by USC faculty member Prince Gomolvilas, author of the stage adaptation of the Scott Heim novel Mysterious Skin and creator of blog “Bamboo Nation.” The panel included Hollywood professionals Kyle Patrick Alvarez, writer and director of Easier with Practice; William Wheeler, screenwriter of The Hoax; and Iris Yamashita, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of Letters from Iwo Jima.
These individuals provided students with a variety of perspectives on what they considered the most appropriate ways of dealing with “real-life adaptations.”
Each panelist brought a different idea and view of incorporating real-life events and people into their films. Alvarez described his experience with Easier with Practice as “not a Davy Rothbart movie,” meaning that he envisioned his film to not be an exact depiction of main character Davy Rothbart, but a “compelling movie” filled with believable and intriguing content.
With regard to The Hoax, Wheeler wanted to take Clifford Irving’s biography of Howard Hughes at “face value,” putting the emphasis not on the truth but on playing with the material and creating an experience fit for the screen.
Although Alvarez and Wheeler discussed the struggles of working with truths of living inspirations, Yamashita discussed dealing with the truth of the dead. In talking about her work, which is often based on a historical event, she acknowledged that it “is much easier to write about dead people,” as the truths revealed about living individuals can be more sensitive than those connected to the dead.
When asked about working with the subjects of his films, Wheeler quickly pointed out that it places limits on the story.
“Journalists want what the subjects least want to give them,” he said.
Because it is often difficult for the subject to break through their embarrassment and share experiences they might not want to, it is difficult to craft a transparent image of them. When the subjects put their “hearts and life into the sources,” Wheeler added, it affects where the character can go organically.
Regardless of the subject, a key to adapting real-life events is to transform those ideas into sellable scripts.
“What people don’t understand is that a novel and a film are two completely different forms,” Gomolvilas said, adding that the film and the inspiration behind it should not be seen in the same way.
Additionally, truth itself is a debatable issue — whether adapting it to film or just life in general.
“Whose truth is it anyway? Two, three, four different people could have different perspectives on the same thing,” Gomolvilas said.
Letters from Iwo Jima, for instance, epitomizes this concept as it represents the Japanese perspective of the events depicted in Flags of Our Fathers (the two are companion films directed by Clint Eastwood).
In the midst of the condensed and edited “true stories,” the line between the real truths and the fictitious “truths” often become blurred by the world on the screen. Although the audience and critics alike will scrutinize a film in attempts to demystify that blur, there arises an implied question:
“Why does it have to be true?” Gomolvilas asked.
For the sake of art, the truth is often bent to fit the screen.

The Black Keys are men of few words. On its second sold-out night at the Hollywood Palladium, the Akron, Ohio-based duo opened its mouth only for generic necessities (“Hello, thank you for coming, thank you to our opening bands, we’ll see you next time”) and let the hour-and-a-half-long wave of distorted soulful blues-grunge say the rest.

Unlike other two-piece bands whose novelty lies in their stripped-down sound — think The White Stripes, Matt and Kim or Lightning Bolt — The Black Keys’ complexity is not burdened by its limited number of musicians.
On Tuesday night, singer/guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney proved this, doing more with two instruments than most bands do with five by filling one of Los Angeles’ larger venues with a flurry of intricate guitar riffs and thundering drum beats that belied their bass-less nature.
First on the bill, however, was local psychedelic surf-rock band — and KSCR Fest alums — The Growlers, whose latest installment of gypsy-influenced lo-fi seemed to turn off the Keys’ new batch of mainstream fans.
Next was Nicole Atkins & the Sea, a noirish folk-rock band who played amid a graveyard of covered-up Black Keys equipment. Carried by Atkins’ heavy vocals, but burdened by her simplistic guitar-playing, the Sea is a constantly evolving group of musicians who Tuesday night consisted of a Cat Stevens-looking bass player, a hipster-Oliver Platt drummer and a female lead guitarist who impeccably shredded so many solos that her Axl Rose-style bandanna seemed almost appropriate.
After the openers retreated backstage, the crowd began to fill in the floor and balconies, searching for a good view of the night’s headliners. The well-ventilated venue might have been relief from the muggy air outside, but it seemed appropriate that the city’s record-breaking heat wave left a humid summer night perfect for some Southern-style blues.
But the weather was not enough to transform the entire crowd into bearded Southern folk — though there was a lot of plaid — and the night remained a mish-mashed Hollywood rock show where girls in Lady Gaga-esque heels and Stevie Nicks tunics mingled with guys in flip flops and Quicksilver shirts.
The fact that the Keys draws such an eclectic crowd is a testament to the universality and timelessness of the blues genre.
Since forming the band in 2001, Auerbach and Carney have paid homage to the roots of blues by covering songs by Junior Kimbrough, their favorite blues guitarist, and organizing a collaboration album with some of today’s most prominent rappers (BlakRoc).
Their garage rock-infused blues have made fans out of much of the hip-hop community, and their albums have consistently referenced African-American culture; for example the cover of their album Thickfreakness is a photo of fingers dipping into a can of hair pomade. And if photos of the two scruffy Midwestern dudes weren’t already all over the Internet, it would be hard to guess the races of the soulful musicians behind it all. It would almost make sense for them to sell a shirt that says “The Black Keys: they’re white.”
Tuesday night’s performance reiterated how much they deserve all of their praise and the new mass-market crowd brought in thanks to their latest effort, Brothers. It also solidified their status as one of music’s most formidable acts.
The Keys emerged to a dark stage illuminated only by a white spotlight and immediately ripped into the title track of Thickfreakness. A black sheet on the back wall of the stage dropped to reveal a red banner with a propaganda-looking logo reminiscent of the Black Power fist.
After playing half a dozen more songs from prior albums, two members of The Growlers emerged and took their places at a guitar and organ behind Auerbach and Carney. An oversized disco ball dropped in front of the banner and the now-foursome went headfirst into “Everlasting Light,” the first song on their new album, a pop-fueled departure from the Keys’ typical dirty blues.
The visiting artists remained for another half-dozen songs, flushing out several of Brothers’ well-produced tracks with rhythm guitar work and Doors-worthy organ solos that gave the songs a uniquely Los Angeles spin.
Auerbach and Carney finished out the show more like rock stars than bluesmen with the back-wall banner dropping to reveal a Christmas light-emblazoned sign that flashed the words “BLACK KEYS” in time with the drawling guitar riffs.
A three-song encore — finishing with “I Got Mine” off of Attack & Release — ended a night that at times seemed ostentatious, but overall balanced the Keys’ past and future in a way that pleased fans of both.
FYI: NONE of the members of the Growlers have EVER played keys or bass with the Black Keys! 
The musicians who sat in with the Black Keys at the Palladium in LA were Nick Movshan and Leon Michels of Truth and Soul Records….

Once upon a time, UCLA hosted the annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books — the nation’s largest public literary festival.
That time is now over.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
USC President C.L. Max Nikias and L.A. Times publisher and CEO Eddy Hartenstein announced on Sept. 22 that USC will be the new host of the Festival of Books this spring.
Though many students might not be excited about holding a book fair on campus, they should be.
The festival will kick off its 16th year at the USC campus and will include more than just book panels; celebrated authors, celebrities, speaker panels and local musicians will all be in attendance. The festival seeks to bring together a variety of demographics and unite them in passion for the written word.
“We are thrilled that the festival has a new home here,” Nikias said to USC News. “The Festival of Books is known for sparking just the kind of intellectual curiosity and energy that are at the heart of USC’s mission.”
The fact that the festival has moved from Westwood to USC’s Downtown location is, in and of itself, a remarkable accomplishment. But knowing why this shift occurred is vital to understanding our university’s increasing standing in the greater Los Angeles area.
From authors to publishers to cultural organizations, the fair will bring together numerous professionals from across the region. This is an encouraging sign that the Times has come to view USC as a prominent cultural center of Los Angeles. If the Times  didn’t think USC was ready to take center stage for such an event, it would not have broken off from its traditional location.
Furthermore, the campus’s physical improvements make hosting this event possible in the first place. Improvements to Child’s Way, the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center and the construction of light-rail systems near USC show how the university has grown and continues to do so. As a hub of Downtown Los Angeles, USC is constantly beautifying its campus and the surrounding area — paving the way for us to host high-profile events.
Consequently, the university will be able to open its doors to the public so everyone can all participate and engage in this festival — which is beneficial for both USC’s image and Los Angeles residents.
The collaboration between USC and the Los Angeles Times in hosting this event also reassures the strength of the university’s business partnerships.
Part of USC’s mission is to team up with organizations that share the same enthusiasm for service and leadership in our communities. Our partnership with the Times is a great example of that effort.
Not only are USC and the Times two of the oldest institutions in Los Angeles, they are also two of the most influential. This key relationship could allow USC to delve into even greater projects that enhance the “breadth and depth” of our education.
Many students might be indifferent toward the festival, not realizing the impact the festival has on them, their majors or their networking opportunities. Admittedly, book festivals might not be the first priority on the list — especially during a sunny spring weekend.
Ultimately, however, this festival really isn’t about books. The collaboration between USC and the Los Angeles Times to host this event communicates to students an important idea: We do not live in a bubble on campus. USC is gradually becoming the embodiment of the diverse culture and intellectual fervor of Los Angeles and all students should be proud to be a part of this exciting transformation.
Judging by Hartenstein’s comments when announcing the festival’s move, it appears as though the festival is at USC for good.
“We are very excited to move the Festival of Books to its beautiful new home,” he said, “and have the opportunity to work hand-in-hand with USC to ensure we grow bigger and better in the future.”
With these accomplishments, we can expect that this event is not just a one-time gig.
The festival is here to stay. And who knows what’s in store next.

Proximity of the Festival of Books to the new Expo light rail will be key to the festival’s future success, with the ability then to draw visitors from as far as Santa Monica and Rancho Park to the campus on a single rail transit ride.  With the linkage of hte Festival of Books to the Westside as well as USC, this is especially exciting!
Agreed with John….what does your professor James Moore have to say about this?
Great article!  Nice to see the Daily Trojan give a shot-out to Exposition, recognizing that USC’s new prominence can only enhanced by connecting it to downtown and the rest of the city.  Now if you could just get James Moore to figure it out.
As a frequent attendee of the Festival of Books, I am very happy to see it move to this central location.  If it’s still at USC in 2012, I’ll be able to come to the festival by taking the Expo light rail line, rather than driving and having to search for parking.  Now this is starting to feel like a real city!

At Drew University in New Jersey, the school’s student health services department decided to cut one of the staples of many modern college health centers: the free condom service.
The health center staff said the service was being misused by students who would try to take the entire basket at once. The actions of those few, however, should not be enough to warrant the elimination of a program that should be an accessible part of every college’s student health services.
Though services such as these provide solid resources to students, they are only a small part of maintaining a healthy environment on campus. In order for a university’s attempts to maintain students’ health to be truly successful, students must have the initiative to take advantage of these resources on their own.
Services such as the one cut at Drew University are a welcome resource to students trying to save a few bucks. Others appreciate the anonymity afforded to them by being able to pick up condoms at the student center rather than purchasing them at the store.
Here at USC, for example, the University Park Health Center provides a space known as the Resource Room, where students can go to pick up free condoms, as well as to find more information on personal health or to talk with a peer health educator. In freshman dorms, the residential advisers often have their own buckets of free contraceptives available to students — no questions asked — in an effort to encourage new students to embrace safe-sex activity.
However, some students I talked to still said they would not feel comfortable walking to the health center to get condoms, even if they were free and available with no questions asked.
Others said they would not want to get condoms from their R.A. if it meant having to go into the R.A.’s room in order to get them. A few students said that their R.A. leaves several condoms in an envelope taped to the outside of his door, and that this was a much more comfortable option.
Still, it ultimately comes down to the students themselves to practice safe sex no matter what method they go about it — especially for freshmen, many of whom experience independence for the first time in college and might come in expecting the glorified, free-wheeling collegiate social life. A conscientious effort must be made to stay within certain healthy boundaries.
According to an article published in the Journal of American College Health in 2009, 80 to 90 percent of college students are sexually active, yet only 26.4 percent of these students reported always using a condom. Additionally, students who engaged in heavy drinking — defined as five or more drinks on one occasion — were less likely to always use condoms than those who didn’t.
Although the social environment of college contributes partly to students not always practicing safe sex, they still need to make the commitment to their health. Truthfully, the “party culture” that some attach to college life should not be an excuse to engage in risky behavior.
Movies and television shows might portray college students as ‘round-the-clock partiers, but such an overblown stereotype is really not entirely accurate. The majority of students are mature individuals who have the level of responsibility necessary to enjoy themselves while still staying within certain boundaries. Most know that safe sex is important — it’s just the execution that needs work.
This is where the university can work with students to encourage healthy and responsible action. According to the previously cited article, only 36 percent of students reported having received information about sexually transmitted disease prevention from their college and 23 percent have received information about pregnancy prevention.
This isn’t high school. We’re all adults — there is no need for mandatory sexual education courses or anything along those lines. There is, however, still an important role that university health services can play in further educating students about safe sex.
The Resource Room at the health center does provide information about sexual health, but little is done to advertise these resources to students. The health center also provides rapid and anonymous HIV testing, but again, little is done to encourage sexually active students to get tested.
The university does have these resources available, however, and ultimately it is the student’s responsibility to have an interest in his or her own health. From information to prevention to practice, students have the necessary tools to enjoy themselves while still staying safe.

Rubbers can be bought at Superior. They even hang them in the “impulse rack” prior to self checkout/regular checkout…because an “impulsive move” can be a lifetime of regret…no pun intended ;)

Web activity on campus came to a halt early Wednesday morning, when Internet access stopped working in multiple areas on campus for about an hour and half because of maintainence by Information Technology Services.
“Last night during the regular maintenance window ITS was upgrading the network security system,” said Kevin Durkin, director of communications and marketing for ITS. “During that process, our folks encountered some difficulties when they were installing the patches. They were able to resolve that and now the network is more secure.”
Durkin said that ITS did its maintenance in the early morning to minimize disruption to students, and that such problems were rare.
He said that installing the patches to the system has made the network much more secure, but apologized for any inconvenience to students.
At 12:20 a.m. the ITS website posted: “We are currently experiencing performance issues with internet connectivity on the USC Network. Some users are unable to connect to the Internet via wireless and Ethernet. We are aware of the problem and are working to resolve it as soon as possible.”
The wi-fi and Ethernet connectivity in Fluor and Webb towers, New/North, Birnkrant, Trojan Hall and Marks Hall did not work during this time period.
“I’ve been sitting around doing nothing. One of my assignments is due tomorrow and I have no idea when I’ll be able to finish it,” said Greg Linscheit, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering.
Samuel Chavarria, a freshman majoring in psychology, said the Internet outage was not the first time access in dorms has been spotty.
“I’ve been writing a paper and I can’t really get the sources I need for specific facts, so I keep just writing in that I need them,” he said. “It’s annoying because this happens far too often for the money we’re paying.”

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed two bills today which will make it easier for junior college students in California to transfer to University of California and California State universities.
The CSU law will make it so students who have completed all required transfer work and obtained a associate in arts degree in a specific major will be guaranteed admission. The UC law will make it so that those schools will examine creating a similar policy.
Although many Californians attend community colleges, a small portion of them end up transferring to four-year universities.
Senator Alex Padilla (D-Pacoima), who authored the bills, said he wanted to make it easier for students to get bachelor’s degrees by making it easier for community college students to take all the classes they need to transfer and to “streamline” the system.
The North Bay Business Journal reported that $160 million is projected to be saved, with $75 million saved annually by community colleges and $85 million saved annually for the CSU system.

Milan Fashion Week is well under way, and two collections this week especially caught our eye.
Dsquared² featured a mix of boyish and sexy looks, from the basics — khakis and Bermuda shorts — to more lavish looks such as crystal embellished sweaters and hot pants. The designers, Dean and Dan Caten (identical twins, hence Dsquared²), struck an impressive balance between preppy and glamorous. Many of the looks included sleek button downs and classic cardigans. Flat oxfords, fedoras and sunglasses accessorized a majority of the looks as well.
Roberto Cavalli’s collection created a very different but nonetheless inspiring show, focused on an island environment with wild jungle plants to set the stage for his runway. He featured crochet and lace leggings, frilly tops, cropped jackets and a variety of cutout pieces. Animal skins and fringe were another of his specialties for this upcoming season, as he merged boho and rock ‘n’ roll styles, perfect for spring.
For those of us who weren’t able to jet off to Milan for Fashion Week, coverage can be found in both The New York Times and Los Angeles Times.

USC’s Jumpstart received $10,000 to continue funding the program, which is geared toward preparing preschool children for kindergarten by getting college students involved with local schools.
Jumpstart, which operates through the USC Volunteer Center received the grant through the USC Neighborhood Outreach Grant.
In its second year at USC, the Jumpstart program sends USC students to teach at eight local preschools. Students volunteer to bring resources and education to young children in order to help better prepare them for kindergarten.
The USC Volunteer Center wrote a grant proposal in collaboration with the Hoover Intergenerational Care preschool. This nearby preschool focuses on early childhood development and provides a platform for the Jumpstart program.
The USC Neighborhood Outreach Grant and the $10,000 are funded by the Good Neighbors Campaign, which encourages fundraising by faculty, staff, students and others through pay deductions or donations.
The proceeds go toward the USC Neighborhood Outreach program, which is devoted to creating a strong relationship between USC and the surrounding community.
In order to receive funding, recipients of the grant must meet certain requirements. One central condition is aligning with one of five strategic initiatives that correspond to the strategic focuses of the university.
Jumpstart appeals to the objective to improve education, said Melissa Gaeke, the director of the USC Volunteer Center.
“Other than the school’s early childhood education, USC doesn’t provide [educational] programming per se,” Gaeke said.
Jumpstart applied to the grant to better meet this need, as the program complies with the education initiative and provides valuable community service, she said.
“Because we are involving USC students in this early childhood programming, we thought it would make for a solid proposal,” Gaeke said.
The grant will be used to acquire more educational resources for the Jumpstart program, including the purchase of additional storybooks.
“Our curriculum is anchored by each storybook. We use one book per week. The money is going to help us to purchase those books, also to help us purchase additional tools and resources. [Without the grant] we wouldn’t have been able to provide the students with those necessary tools to be able to use in the classroom,” said Punam Bhakta, the Jumpstart program manager.
In addition to buying more materials, the grant will help the program increase its scope by reaching out to other preschools.
“We are able to expand with more resources,” Bhakta said. “If we are given more funding then we can reach more children, reach more families.”
Currently, Jumpstart is funded by two grants — including the most recent Good Neighbors grant — and funds from the USC Volunteer Center, which includes student programming fees.
“One of the key reasons I did Jumpstart was to kind of gain a relationship with kids that might not have the resources I had growing up and to make sure their education wasn’t put on the back burner, wasn’t ignored from lack of resources,” said Jumpstart Team Leader Leah Mireles, a junior majoring in international relations.
The program has been successful at improving education in the local community, as shown through forms that teachers fill out to measure the children’s development, Mireles said.
On a larger scale, the Jumpstart program helps to enhance education by creating an interest in learning among young children, Mireles said.
“You go in and you work with them and you see them progress into the student who’s not only bubbly in the social aspect but bubbly in terms of [being] excited for education, excited to read, excited to learn new things,” she said. “Hopefully that translates into the rest of their education,” she said.

It’s been exactly one year today since senior running back Stafon Johnson suffered life-threatening injuries when he lost grip of the 275-pound barbell he was lifting, causing it to drop directly onto his neck.  Johnson had to undergo emergency surgery to repair injuries received to his neck and larynx.
Losing  Johnson was a big hit to USC’s football program, as he had scored five touchdowns in the first four games, including the game-winning run versus Ohio State.
Though his season was ended prematurely, Johnson said he was happy to be alive, and his road to recovery has been a miraculous one.
Due to his “gladiator mentality,” as his doctor, Ryan F. Osbourne put it, Johnson was making phenomenal progress, and was already speaking again less than two months after surgery.
In his first public appearance since surgery, Johnson whispered to the press the last thing his late grandfather had said to him, “God has a plan.  Run, Stafon. Run.”  And that’s exactly what he did.
Though Johnson was not selected in the 2010 NFL draft, he signed a contract with the Tennessee Titans soon after.  Sadly, Johnson’s courageous comeback was delayed.
In a preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks, Johnson severely dislocated his ankle after getting tackled, and is now expected to be out for eight to 12 weeks.
Johnson has proven his tenacity before, and his “gladiator mentality” will serve him well in yet another road to recovery.

California gubernatorial candidates Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown debated live for the first time this campaign season Tuesday night, when they discussed their plans to help the state’s struggling economy.
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted a debate watch in the Taper Hall of Humanities, which was preceded by a panel discussion about Whitman’s and Brown’s debate strategies.
Sound off - Former Republican Gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon (right) speaks with Andre Pineda (left), the former pollster for President Barack Obama, at an event hosted by the Unruh Institute. The discussion was moderated by Gordon Stables (center). Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan
Former California gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon and former Obama for America pollster Andre Pineda discussed what they anticipated the candidates would speak about as well as the challenges each faced coming into the debate. Annenberg Debate Director Gordon Stables moderated the event.
“They’re both going to be approaching from these different angles and seeing, can they find that way to connect with these voters,” Pineda said.
The main challenge, Pineda said, was for the candidates to find a way to identify with voters and create a relatable personality.
“With George Bush, you wanted to have a beer with the guy,” Pineda said. “And now you have Jerry Brown and Meg Whitman, who aren’t quite in the same league.”
The candidates’ main difference, Simon said, is that Brown comes from a long history of government experience while Whitman has worked in the private sector as the former CEO of eBay.
“Jerry Brown has been around a long time and he’s made a lot of decisions,” Simon said.
During the gubernatorial debate, Whitman outlined her plan to improve the state’s budget by stimulating the private sector. She said she plans to create 2 million jobs for Californians by 2015 and will cut certain taxes for factories and small businesses.
“We have the third-highest unemployment rate, only behind Michigan and Nevada,” Whitman said. “We have got to get Californians back to work.”
Brown, however, said he believed tax cuts would not be as effective as his plan to work with the California legislature and boost the clean energy economic sector.
“I know that many of these legislators have no idea what’s going on with the budget,” Brown said. “You’ve got to live within your means.”
The two candidates disagreed on several key points, such as Brown’s effectiveness as governor when he served two terms from 1975 to 1983.
Brown insisted that he was able to make the best of an economy in recession, despite Whitman’s argument that Brown helped create the problems California currently faces.
“Jerry Brown has no experience changing Sacramento for the positive,” she said.
In his closing remarks, Brown emphasized his experience in government, saying it was what the state needed.
“I’ve been looking at government from every angle,” Brown said. “That’s what gives me such determination to make things better.”
Whitman, however, said she believes California needs and outsider’s perspective.
“If we are going to change the direction of the state, we are going to have to go at it very differently,” Whitman said.
Aaron Taxy, an undeclared freshman, said he grew up in Oakland and likes how Brown managed the city. Brown was the mayor of Oakland from 1998 to 2006.
“Brown talked specifics and showed the depth of his knowledge,” Taxy said.
Other students, such as Kyle Padilla, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television critical studies, said they thought Whitman debated well.
“Whitman showed how up-to-date and familiar she is with numbers and … real-world issues,” he said. “I think her biggest advantage will be growing the job market.”

Renovations along the stretch of Child’s Way from Watt Way to the Widney Alumni House were completed Tuesday, said Joe Back, Associate Senior Vice President for Campus Development and Facilities Management.
Along Child’s Way, there have been improvements made to the adjacent walkways and the parking lot between them to improve pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle traffic.
Face lift - The university completed the improvements on Child’s Way, which included two vehicle gates and cosmetic changes. Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
Two gates were installed on both sides of the parking lot to control delivery truck traffic that had gotten out of control, Back said.
“They would go in there and really block the parking and everything would just shut down,” Back said. “People would be stuck in there — they couldn’t get in, they couldn’t get out.”
Cosmetic improvements, including landscaping and brick, were also an aspect of the construction project.
“This area on Child’s Way is where most of the guests that come to campus park, so we wanted to enhance that area,” Back said. “It was not really landscaped all that well. It didn’t look that attractive coming in there … We did a little extra landscaping to make it look better.”
Back said he could not disclose the cost of the construction but a USC News article reported that it totaled $2 million.
Some students, such as Joel Kropinski, said that money could have been spent on other things.
“I don’t even see why they did it,” said Kropinski, a senior majoring in cinema-television critical studies. “Is it such a big deal if a car comes in and out of here? I just don’t think a gate is a priority right now. [The money] could’ve been spent in other ways.”
Nick Simons, a senior majoring in business administration, said that aesthetic improvements to the campus should not be a priority right now.
“I think there has to be a better way for those funds to be allocated,” Simons said. “USC is one of the most beautiful campuses. We’ve done enough … They should be focusing on more tangible improvements for the students.”
Erica Shieh, a junior majoring in music industry, said that she would like to see money going to the students instead of the physical appearance of the campus.
“In this economy, it’s not practical,” Shieh said. “This money needs to go to students in form of scholarships and grants.”
Back said the project was not a spontaneous decision; the improvements were officially approved in September 2009.
“It’s a project that’s been discussed for a while,” Back said. “They really wanted to get that under control … It started as a real discussion about controlling the truck traffic in that area, but it evolved into more of an aesthetic enhancement as well.”
USC’s office of Capital Construction is planning other future projects, Back said.
“There are discussions about what we call ‘hardscapes,’” Back said. “Sidewalks and that sort of thing, hardscape and landscape improvements.”
Personally, I think this is a nice improvement for campus.  Cosmetic improvements are important for a college.  Let’s face it – colleges are essentially products that are being marketed to students.  If prospective students / visitors get out of their car only to say, “Hey this campus doesn’t look very attractive,” that will certainly factor into their ultimate decision.  It’s just like cars.  Even though a used car may run fine, does anyone really want to give a junker looking car a chance?  Attracting future students is critical for the University’s ongoing health.
Yeah, some pictures would be great. THANKS!
You think you can take more photos next time? This story lacks the visuals necessary to see the improvements done.

Still fighting · Quarterback Jake Locker, shown here against the Trojans in 2009, decided to forgo the NFL draft for his senior season. - Daily Trojan file photo
When Washington’s senior quarterback Jake Locker enters the Coliseum Saturday night, hold back your typical howls of disgust and take the high road.
Yes. That’s correct. As the 6-foot-3-inch 230-pound quarterback saunters onto the field for the Huskies’ first offensive drive, you should welcome him with what he deserves during his final tour around the Pac-10 conference — respectful and sincere applause.
This might not seem fitting for a man who single-handedly squashed the Trojans’ 2009 BCS Title chances, with 237 passing yards and a back-breaking 68-yard scoring drive during last year’s shocking September upset.
Nonetheless, it is an opportunity for each of us to give something back to an individual who personifies everything that still remains pure in a sport clouded by an imperfect ranking system, agent interference and scandals galore — not as fans of the university, but as knowledgeable followers of the collegiate game.
Coming out of Washington’s Ferndale High School in 2005 as the state’s 3A Player of the Year, Locker entered his freshman season facing an enormous amount of pressure to bring his state the level of success not seen since the early 1990s.
He was to be the Pac-10 Conference’s next golden arm, following in the recent footsteps of names like Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart and Aaron Rodgers.
However, the success the Bellingham, Wash., native found in his initial season as a Husky didn’t make for any front-page headlines or afford him any face time on ESPN.
Instead, he was relegated to leading a much different type of unit — the practice team.
But it was here that the legend of Jake Locker was born.
It was during those quiet film sessions and isolated hours of irrelevance and humility that Locker, traveling squad quarterback, became the face of the University of Washington and its program’s finest student of the game.
Three years later, with a bevy of accomplishments in his rearview mirror — the 2007 Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, 2009 Seattle Male Sports Star of the Year and the 2009 Guy Flaherty Most Inspirational Award, to name a few — the easiest decision for one of the nation’s best dual-threat quarterbacks would have been to bypass his senior season and head for greener pastures when the NFL came calling last spring.
After all, the Pac-10’s reigning passing and total offense leader was never recognized with the Heisman brass that Leinart won in 2004, nor did his noteworthy exploits receive nearly the amount of adoration that media darlings Tim Tebow, Colt McCoy and Sam Bradford grew so accustomed to during their rises to notoriety.
Any attention, especially when it came from the likes of ESPN draft experts Mel Kiper Jr. and Todd McShay — who both predicted Locker to be the No. 1 pick overall — would have made even the most gun-shy of athletes ready to make the leap to the next level.
But for a young man who finds comfort spending his summer nights cheering on UW’s women’s softball team in the College World Series rather than abusing his quickly growing celebrity status to maneuver through crowded nightclubs in Seattle, there was no surprise when the Emerald State’s most prized gridiron star chose one more year of college football.
“The thing about Jake is that he is one of the most sincere, genuine guys,” said Husky senior linebacker Mason Foster after Locker announced he would stay. “I knew he was going to come back.”
Crazy? Maybe a little.
Admirable? Without a doubt.
Simply put, Locker is spending his final 13 games giving people one more four-month chance to witness how he has remarkably redefined the word “sincere.”
There was no conscious thought of the money or yearning to fill an already-crammed trophy case with some of college football’s finest postseason awards.
No, Locker is driven by something much deeper, a concept that he is truly the pigskin version of his brother’s keeper.
“No guy in that locker room has ever been to a bowl game as a player,” Locker said about the decision. “I know they all had aspirations to. I know I did.”
And although the storybook ending for the beleaguered program — which has only won 17 games since 2005 — and its once-in-a-generation face appears to be a far cry from reality after two painful early season losses to BYU and Nebraska, the journey is one that every Pac-10 student, fan, employee and rabid devotee should embrace with open arms.
Look around the landscape of the NFL. More specifically, take a glance at who is lining up for your favorite professional team behind center.
Entering week one, an impressive seven starting quarterbacks of the 32 teams hailed from the Pac-10. Outside of the pearly gates of Troy, however, only former Cal quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a first-round draft pick.
The others: bed-ridden Dennis Dixon, recent member of the nation’s unemployment line Trent Edwards, newly minted second-stringer Matt Moore and Derek Anderson, the owner of the league’s lowest completion percentage for a quarterback who has played in all three games.
In recent years, the Pac-10 (outside of USC) has delivered some of the more underwhelming passers that the game has seen in quite some time. Somewhere down the line from Jim Plunkett to John Elway to Troy Aikman to Carson Palmer, the torch fell and no one seemed to notice.
So before Locker’s decision to return to school for his senior season becomes a joke, appreciate the bold individual and the choice he has made.
The 22-year-old might never win the Heisman, his draft stock might see him shaking Commissioner Roger Goodell’s hand a little later in the first round than initially expected and that ever-elusive bowl game appearance might ultimately prove to be nothing short of a pipe dream.
But regardless, Locker’s unselfish desire to act on the basis of “we” rather than “me” makes his senior season not only a win for the University of Washington, but a resounding victory for a conference looking for some steady hands to carry the once-fabled quarterback torch again.
So on Saturday night, allow yourself to be color-blinded by No. 10, if only for a few moments.
There is no shame in taking the rare occasion to thank him for restoring a frequently tarnished game’s reputation with a career that preaches an utmost sense of commitment to the team concept and a steadfast passion for upholding the privilege of playing between the white lines.
I know I will.

There is more to this young man than football. His commitment to the team matches his commitment to community. He is the spokesperson for the Run of Hope in Seattle – taking place this Sunday. And despite getting back to Seattle at 2AM this Saturday morning he will be at the event Sunday morning. The event raises money for Pediatric Brain Tumor Research and he’s participation is in honor and memory of his friendship with my eight-year-old son, Kyle, who passed away from a rare brain tumor last year. Thank you for seeing what so many seem to miss. http://www.runofhopeseattle.com
very nice..NOW SMASH LOCKER!!!
A very heartfelt article. The sentiments and beliefs are ones that are frequently lost in the dayso f high salaries and instant fame that is dangled in the faces of todays premier college athletes.  Nice to see that someone out there recognizes the strength of character, moral conviction and sense of team that is required for one to “stay the course” and remain in a not so winning program for the full four years….maybe actually getting an education out o that time as well.

A USC professor and team of graduate students have helped create an online social media platform that allows immigrants in the Los Angeles area to share their stories via cell phones.
The platform, called VozMob — short for voces móbiles, Spanish for “mobile voices” — has gained popularity in recent months, said François Bar, an associate professor of communication who helped lead the project.
Anyone with a cell phone can send in stories, opening the platform to many without Internet access or additional software on their phones.
VozMob was created from an existing collaboration between the Institute of Popular Education of Southern California (IDEPSCA) and USC’s Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism. The team included members of IDEPSCA, USC graduate students and Bar.
Bar said the platform is significant for immigrants because it allows them to share their stories without the filter of the mainstream media, which he says depicts immigrants “unfavorably and [with] bias.”
“[It allows immigrants] to give a direct expression on what matters to [them],” Bar said.
Bar said he got involved in the project through graduate students working with IDEPSCA.
“What drew me to this project [was] finding an area where technology is not designed and [being able to] invent new things,” he said.
Bar also said he is interested in seeing how far he can push technology and what the obstacles are, something that he said he is discovering with this project.
According to Bar, VozMob is significant because it was designed with the community in mind.
The program also gives users an incentive to learn new skills, such as using advanced media editing software. Classes on how to use the software are offered by IDEPSCA.
In the past few months, the popularity of VozMob has grown mostly through word of mouth, Bar said. One goal for the future is to expand the user base by working with different organizations.
The program is currently for Los Angeles-based immigrants, but nationwide expansion is a possibility that Bar and the rest of his team are looking into.
“I see it being used by more groups and we’re in the process of figuring out which groups will be the best fit for using it,” Bar said.
The open-source technology used in VozMob can be used outside of the networking context as well.
“I am talking to colleagues who want to use the tool as a part of classes [in Annenberg], either as a reporting tool or to complement the story [with sources],” Bar said.
The project is already being implemented globally by USC graduate students. Charlotte Lapsansky, a graduate student studying communication who is currently working in India, is using the same open-source technology to create a program that can be used for workers in the field to communicate and post their findings.
“VozMob is not going to be the next Facebook,” Bar said, adding he hopes it will become a resource for immigrants wishing to share their stories with the world.
Graduate students from USC were a central part of the small team creating VozMob. The majority of students were from Annenberg, but students from the USC School of Cinematic Arts were also involved.
Benjamin Stokes, a member of the team who is pursuing his Ph.D. in communication, said he was drawn to USC because of the opportunity to work on VozMob.
“My work is to be an advocate and do outreach for the project, [to] tell other people about it and then put [them] in contact with IDEPSCA,” he said.
Karen Romero, a freshman majoring in business administration whose parents immigrated to the United States from Mexico, said she thinks the website is a good idea.
“It seems like a good resource for people to learn about others from all walks of life,” she said.
Stokes said he was drawn to the project because it allows immigrants to tell their stories.
“As human beings, they deserve to express their voices,” Stokes said. “[Through VozMob], people with the least voice will be heard.”

The Trojans officially went into revenge mode Tuesday, practicing with all of their focus on the team that beat them in one of USC’s biggest upsets last year — Washington.
“They’ve gone 365 days with that victory and we’re upset about it,” senior linebacker Michael Morgan said. “We’ve let our fans down, our families down, so we’re going to make sure we come out with a ‘W.’”

Huskies quarterback Jake Locker, a preseason Heisman Trophy candidate, is the main focus for USC. The dual-threat quarterback ran for a touchdown and threw for 237 yards enroute to last year’s 16-13 victory.
Yet, he’s shown that he can be stopped, going 4-for-20 for 71 yards and two interceptions in a blowout loss to Nebraska earlier this year. Unfortunately for the Trojans, they can’t copy the formula Nebraska used to beat the Huskies.
“If you can find six DBs that all run about 4.4, you can put a game plan [for Locker] in where you put all of them in together like [Nebraska] did,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Whenever he broke, for the most part they were able to catch him. That’s something that, with our personnel, we don’t have the ability to do, so we have to go a different direction.”
USC has had some trouble containing dual-threat quarterbacks in the past — see Oregon quarterback Jeramiah Masoli last year and Hawai’i’s signal-caller Bryant Moniz this season — so that is something the Trojans are focusing on this week.
“He has a hell of an arm, so we’ve got to respect his passing game. But we’ve got to make sure we focus on the run, because this year [Moniz] scrambled on us a little bit, so we gotta focus on that as well,” Morgan said.

Redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton was limited in practice Tuesday. Horton left Saturday’s game late in the third quarter after being kicked in the back while falling down attempting to make a tackle by redshirt sophomore defensive end Nick Perry.
Horton said after the game his back was sore and said he still felt some pain Tuesday.
Kiffin said he is hopeful Horton can play this weekend, but Horton hadn’t talked to the doctors about that before practice Tuesday.
“I’m feeling alright, but the coaches want me to just take it one day at a time,” Horton said. “I’ve got to talk to the doctors. I’m going to talk to them right now, then I’ll get a better idea of what’s going on. I’m still a little bit sore, but they’re taking care of me.”
–
Los Angeles has been struck with record temperatures the past few days, and Kiffin said he hoped the heat would stay a little longer.
However, the temperature Tuesday was only in the 90s, and it seemed to get cooler right before practice started.
“I thought the practice today just started OK,” Kiffin said. “I was hoping for the heat to stay out here, but for whatever reason the heat dropped 10-15 degrees right before we started, so hopefully it’ll be hot again tomorrow. I thought we really pushed our guys and challenged them to get in better shape so they can really play a complete game.”

The Trojan men’s golf team had a rough third day of competition at the Ping/Golfweek Fall Preview in Stillwater, Okla. on Tuesday, finishing up a disappointing first outing.
At the end of competition on Monday, the Trojans were at a 60-over-par 636 (331-305) in last place but within striking distance of 14th place Texas Christian University.
Swinging away · Sophomore Martin Trainer led the Trojans with a total 16-over-par 232 and a 48th place finish, but his efforts were not enough to vault USC out of last place. The Fall Preview was the first tournament for the Trojans this season. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
Day three proved to be no easier. The Trojans, led by sophomores T.J. Vogel and Martin Trainer, shot a 24-over-par 312 and finished last in a field of 15.
The team was unhappy with the final result.
“It was disappointing,” Trainer said. “We know we can be in a position to win or at least be in contention at an event like this.“
Best on the day for the Trojans was Vogel. Dealing with a hip injury that sidelined him in the first round, he managed a 4-over-par 76 — two strokes more than his second-round score.
Vogel had a tough first nine, hitting two bogeys, one triple bogey and only one birdie. He pulled it together for the last nine holes, hitting one birdie and one bogey, coming out even. Vogel was not eligible for individual scoring, however, because he sat out Sunday.
Next came Trainer, hitting a 6-over-par 78.
Trainer struggled throughout his round, hitting three double bogeys, two bogeys and two birdies. On Monday, Trainer came through with a solid 3-over-par 75, but could not repeat on Tuesday.
“Today was frustrating,” Trainer said. “Seventy-five percent of my game was really good, but the other 25 percent was awful. There were four or five holes where I made really poor decisions, but other than that I played well.”
Trainer was USC’s highest finisher, hitting a 16-over-par 232 (79-75-78), enough for 48th in the 73-man field.
Sophomore Stewart Hagestad and freshman Jeffrey Kang both hit 7-over-par 79s.
Both had trouble on the first nine holes, with Hagestad losing five strokes and Kang six before rallying for a strong last nine. Hagestad ended up with a 20-over-par 236 (79-78-79) and tied for 58th, while Kang hit 22-over-par 238 (81-78-79) and tied for 63rd.
Rounding out the Trojans was sophomore Sam Smith, who hit a 14-over-par 86. Although he hit the team’s only eagle in round three, Smith was not able to match his day two scores, falling behind that mark by another five strokes. Smith finished 73rd, hitting a total 43-over-par 259 (92-81-86).
The Trojans were missing junior standout Steve Lim, who was attending a family wedding in Korea.
“We really missed Steve,” Trainer said. “The course really suits his style of play and he would have done well.”
Despite a disappointing first outing, the Trojans remain optimistic.
“We definitely didn’t meet our full potential. We can do a lot better,” Trainer said. “We just need to get out there and practice hard.”
The Trojans’ next shot at redemption is Oct. 11 and 12, when they face Ohio State in Columbus, Ohio.
