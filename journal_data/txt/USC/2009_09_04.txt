A recent survey by a local civil rights organization appears to confirm widespread notions about the lackluster quality of the city’s public transport system.
The survey, conducted by the Bus Riders Union, Los Angeles, gave the Metropolitan Transportation Authority a “D,” criticizing the MTA for high prices and slipshod efficiency.
Round and round · A poll of 2,600 local riders by the Bus Riders Union found that people think the Metro is overcrowded and inefficient. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The poll was conducted by distributing postcards to about 2,600 local bus riders, who were asked to grade the MTA on seven different criteria, according to the Bus Riders Union website. Among the categories under which the MTA received a “D” or worse were fare prices, overcrowding on the buses and shortage of service.
Though students said they shared some of the same issues with the bus riders, many don’t find the system as troublesome as other riders.
Myka Winder, a graduate student studying occupational therapy, said she uses the commuter line almost every day to get to USC from her home in the South Bay.
“I’m very satisfied with the Metro system, most of the time,” Winder said. “They don’t always have enough room on the buses and some of them break down, but it’s very efficient.”
Rahul Dureja, a senior majoring in computer science, said even though they system can be frustrating at times, he is satisfied with the overall state of LA’s public transportation.
“It is a very good service and the drivers are very friendly,” Dureja said. “[Though] during peak hours it’s overcrowded, and on the weekends the time between buses is very long.”
Though some students didn’t seem concerned, Barbara Lott-Holland, co-chairman for the Bus Riders Union, said she believes they should be.
“Students are affected, especially after rush hour; the buses are fewer,” Lott-Holland said. “If you’re a student working, when you’re running from class to class, and then trying to get to that job that helps to subsidize your higher learning, that’s very serious.”
Marc Littman, the Metro’s director of public relations, questioned the validity of the Bus Riders Union’s poll.
“They only looked at bus riders on the busiest lines. They looked at just 2,000 [people]. With our poll that we did last June, we looked at 50,800 system-wide bus and rail riders… We did not look at just our busiest lines but all our lines,” he said.
In fact, a similar survey conducted earlier yielded very different results.
“What our survey found last June was that 80.6 percent were satisfied with the metro bus service … 73.3 percent responded that Metro bus service is better now than last year,” Littman said.
Still, Littman did admit there were some flaws in the system.
“Our on-time performance is critical. We need to improve that,” said Littman.
“Our fares are the lowest of any transit property in the United States. The base fare is $1.25 … If you’re a student here, for $36 you can get a pass.”
Littman noted he has taken the bus for more than 40 years.
“You shouldn’t have the illusion that we can be as fast and convenient as a car — we just aren’t,” Littman said. “The best thing to do is go to metro.net and use the trip planner.”

These days, comedy’s best friend is your average Joe.
Writer-producer-director Mike Judge taps into this phenomenon with his own quirky rendition of ordinary people living their ordinary lives.
The factory · Funnyman Jason Bateman stars in Extract, the latest film from Office Space director Mike Judge. The film opens Friday. -  Photo courtesy of Miramax Films
Judge’s latest film, Extract, is being promoted as the unofficial sequel to his box-office-flop-turned-cult-classic Office Space, harnessing the same “stick-it-to-the-man” attitude.
The emphasis here, however, isn’t on the star-studded ensemble cast. Instead, the film focuses on food extract factory owner Joel Reynolds (Jason Bateman), whose daily race to make it home before his wife Suzie (Kristen Wiig) changes into her sweatpants keeps his testosterone boiling.
Enter new factory employee Cindy (Mila Kunis), whose hottie status spices up the workplace’s atmosphere of boredom. With prodding from his best friend Dean (Ben Affleck), horse tranquilizers and some ill-founded guy logic, straight-edge Joel finds himself hiring a boy-wonder gigolo (Dustin Milligan) to sleep with his wife so that he can pursue his own extramarital activities guilt-free.
Adding to the madness, no one seems to notice that the new hire and object of everyone’s affection is actually a thieving and manipulating sociopath.
After years of battling with movie studio executives, Judge has finally made it on his own, forming his own production company to keep creative control of his material.
As a result, Judge is one of the few directors in Hollywood with authority over the movie’s final product. But judging from the slow progression and poor character development, his new film might have been in desperate need of outsider input.
The majority of Extract focuses on setting up the predicaments that ensue, making it feel like an extended television show that should have ended at 30 minutes instead of being allowed to flatline across the entire span of a full-length movie.
Audiences are forced to sift through the cluttered plot, choosing whether to focus on the sexual escapades, the pending lawsuit against the factory or the money-grubbing manipulator wreaking havoc in Joel’s personal and professional life.
When the film finally hits its climax, everything goes completely wrong but then magically and all-too-neatly fixes itself —  in about 20 minutes.
Bateman’s ability to play the “everyman” garners some audible laughs and sympathy for his plight, but fails to grasp the depth needed for credibility.
Joel’s actions, from his foolishly hatched plan to his unbelievable management decisions, relay a series of events that highlight not only the limitations within the script, but also the importance and difficulties of grounding comedy in real life scenarios.
Some might recognize Saturday Night Live alumnus David Koechner as Nathan, the annoying neighbor who passive-aggressively pesters Joel into a friendship he never  wanted.
With his dorky glasses and uptight garb, Nathan parks himself in Joel’s driveway, forcing conversation and even cornering him into a Rotary Club dinner. Koechner plays the neighbor from hell to a T, which becomes painfully hilarious to watch as images of your own resident nightmare are conjured.
Like Joel, however, Nathan lacks full-fledged character development. The sustained emphasis on his obnoxious habits are maddening to watch.
In general, the film’s characters are meant to be drawn from everyday life, but each person’s unfavorable trait is so exaggerated that it overshadows the subtleties of human behavior. Flaws are emphasized to the point of redundancy.
At times, voice-overs and obvious cuts cover spotty acting, revealing either a lack of storytelling finesse or the inability of the actors to harness their star power within.
When Joel and Dean smoke up at a buddy’s house, the insertion of typical “stoner” music — a combination of exotic instruments — invokes an almost uncomfortable reliance on auditory sensibilities to create a mood that should be readily apparent through the acting — not that it makes any of it less funny. In fact, the scenes where music is put in overdrive are pleasantly reworked to enhance the overall comedic effect.
On paper, Extract has the makings of a potential box office hit, but it stacks too many wild events and one-dimensional characters to tap into the same cultural phenomenon that Judge accomplished with Office Space.
But maybe that’s the point: the film is meant to show exactly just how out of hand and surprising life can be.
Or, maybe, Judge is just riding out the wave he came in on.

The issue of federal vs. state governmental authority has been a bone of contention within the American political system since its foundation. Today, national laws have become so pointedly exact on the issue that the federal government has virtually lost the ability to intervene in state affairs, unless there is a very strong disparity between a given policy and federal constitutional standards.
For that reason, it is rare for the federal courts to get involved without coming out on top, because they tend to be indisputably in the right. Nevertheless, that won’t stop most states’ political elite from complaining.
In February, a federal three-judge panel ruled that California must reduce prison overcrowding by as many as 55,000 inmates within three years. The number dropped down to 40,000 over the next few months, but it may have been a well-timed compromise. In dropping the headcount, the time factor was also reduced: California lawmakers would need to have a viable plan of action for dealing with the overcrowding by Sept. 18.
The issue of time is more critical than some might think. For one thing, it gives the state less time to create a strong case to appeal the federal court’s decision; lawmakers would have to create a less-than-perfect case and do it quickly, or else stall by creating an overcrowding reduction plan that, once created, would make prison population cuts a much more viable reality for Californians.
Furthermore, from a social justice perspective, when it comes to dealing with overcrowding, the sooner the better. California currently incarcerates more of its citizens than any other state in the union, and under the current conditions the state has been unable to provide constitutional levels of medical and mental health care. The California prison system was designed to support approximately half of its current number of inmates; in some facilities, the overcrowding is even greater than that. This cruel and unusual punishment has led to the fully preventable death of at least one prisoner every week within the state.
Apart from the moral concerns of placing human beings in unlivable conditions such as these, there is also the pressing issue of the state budget. The federal court estimated that the state could save between 800 and 900 million dollars annually by reducing the numbers of prisoners. That money could well be used to prop up the public education system, to rebuild in the wake of crippling wildfires or perhaps simply to pay off some of the state’s staggering deficit — all seemingly better options than continuing to hold people captive with no real plan for reform.
What the court doesn’t mention is the private capital that California’s state prisons generate. For those involved in the incarceration machine, putting people in prison is a very lucrative business, generating billions of dollars annually. The state won’t continue to support building new prisons if the overcrowding problem goes away. If the prisons stop being built, those companies that rely on the prison market to sell everything from suicide-proof toilets to closed-circuit televisions will be out of business.
So who wins, the man or the market? For the federal courts, the human element took center stage. But this week the state government, led by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, is making sure to put up a good fight — whether their case is strong or not, they’re headed to the Supreme Court.
In the California Republican Party’s defense, California does spend more on prison health care and has a lower mortality rate among prisoners than many other states. Yet somehow, the fact that other states are inflicting even greater evil (admittedly upon smaller numbers of people) doesn’t really make the current situation look any better. And the fact that California has recently made a huge investment in spending on inmate health care certainly doesn’t help the budget.
And then, of course, there’s the age-old argument that was so eloquently evoked by California Attorney General Jerry Brown when he said, “This order… does not recognize the challenges of incarcerating criminals, many of whom are deeply disturbed.” Translation: It’s not that we want to keep paying to keep prisoners in jail, it’s just that we can’t afford to release them into society; they just aren’t like us, mentally.
Chances are most prisoners are not inherently evil; however, even if that were the case, the court laid out a few good ways to help set them free while still maintaining public safety. Diverting nonviolent felons to county programs and changing the probation system are just a couple of institutional reforms that could be hugely beneficial. Whether it be fear, economics or something else that propels state authorities to fight this ruling, one can only hope the Supreme Court will fulfill its federal duty and uphold the Constitution — and nothing more.

Behind the strong play of sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter, the No. 16 USC women’s volleyball team (3-1) swept its third straight match (25-22, 25-19, 25-15) of the young season, defeating Florida Gulf Coast (1-3) to open the Holiday Inn LA City Center Trojan Invitation at the Galen Center.
Jupiter took charge in the 3-0 sweep, landing 16 kills and blocking two shots in a match where the Women of Troy seemed to get better as each minute went by.
Sweet 16 · Alex Jupiter lead USC with 16 kills on Thursday. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan
“We were going too fast early. We were too excited,” coach Mick Haley said of his team during its home opener. “We just came out and tried a little too hard early.”
After the first game, one in which USC and the Eagles combined for nine ties and six lead changes before the Women of Troy pulled away, Haley’s team dominated the rest of the way behind Jupiter.
“She’ll continue to get better. She’s just a whole different player right now,” Haley said. “We really like the way she’s blocking and serving.”
Senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin chipped in with five kills and 12 digs for the Women of Troy, and sophomore setter Kendall Bateman continued to set the table USC as she piled up 35 assists.
On the opposite side, junior outside hitter Jelena Simic carried the Eagles, firing 11 kills and blocking one shot, but it wasn’t enough for Florida Gulf Coast, which has lost three of its first four matches to start the season.
USC shot .287 compared to the Eagles’ .092.
After dropping the first match of the season 3-2 to Michigan State last weekend, the Women of Troy have responded with three consecutive sweeps over North Carolina, Albany and the Eagles.
“We have to just know that we didn’t play very well in the first match, and we’d like to keep this going, but we know it’s going to be very tough,” Haley said.
The Women of Troy continue tournament play tomorrow at 7 p.m. against No. 21 Pepperdine at the Galen Center. Pepperdine should provide USC with its toughest match to this point in the season.
“They always give us a battle,” Haley said.
Following tomorrow’s game, USC will wrap up the tournament facing Northern Arizona on Saturday at 10 a.m.

They say good first impressions are important, and for the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team, this weekend’s Triton Invitational will be the place to show that they haven’t lost a step since their undefeated 2008 campaign ended with a national championship.
Headed to the Canyonview Aquatic Center in San Diego to participate in the annual event hosted by UC San Diego, the Trojans are well aware of the need to set an early season tone if they are to repeat their blemish-free record of the past season.
Huge target · Senior driver Matt Sagehorn and the Trojans know that every opposing team will give them their best shot this season. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“We all know we have to come to play from the beginning,” junior driver Kyle Sterling said. “Everyone’s going to be gunning for us.”
The invitational will feature eight teams from the surrounding area, including No. 5 Pepperdine and No. 6 Loyola Marymount, both of whom took the Trojans to a sudden death overtime period in last season’s Triton.
Senior driver Nico Sardo, who is among the upperclassmen who helped the Trojans to the championship last year, partially blames the close results from last year’s event on a lack of excitement for the event, but sees a change for this year’s edition.
“There’s definitely a chance for lackadaisicalness, but I think we’re much more prepared and ready,” Sardo said.
Although Pepperdine looms in the championship portion of the Invitational, the Trojans will start the weekend on Saturday with a match against Pomona-Pitzer, the third-ranked team in Division II, followed quickly by a match with No. 19 Air Force.
“You definitely want to make a statement. Making an early statement is always a good thing,” Sardo said. And although their first two opponents aren’t traditional powerhouses, “they’re not going to just roll over, they do train hard, and you have to go play hard.”
USC will open Sunday with their final Group A match against LMU, and then will wait to see who emerges from the set of Group B round robin matches. The seeding matches will depend upon which team finishes where in the group standings, No. 1 in Group A playing No.1 in Group B, and so on. If USC ends up facing off against Pepperdine, it would be the second straight year that the two teams play for the Triton Invitational final.
Other teams that the Trojans could from Group B encounter include No. 7 UC Santa Barbara or host No. 10 UC San Diego.
Either way the Triton Invitational turns out, the team realizes the importance of getting this season off to a good start.
“It’s a building block for the rest of the season; if you start off well, you hopefully can do well for the rest of the season,” Sardo said.
But the general idea about the Triton Invitational, and the season, to Sardo, is quite simple:
“It’s never good to give anybody hope.”

F. Scott Fitzgerald once famously said, “Family quarrels are bitter things. They don’t go according to any rules. They’re more like splits in the skin that won’t heal because there’s not enough material.”
Still Walking, the new film by the modern Japanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda, is about just that kind of wound, the sort that springs from the dysfunction that boils just beneath the surface of a traditional family.
Private lives · The Japanese film Still Walking explores the dysfunctional lives of a large family over a 24-hour period. Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, this quiet, nuanced film has won numerous awards at festivals. - Photos courtesy of IFC Films
The film details a 24-hour period in the lives of a large Japanese family. Elderly patriarch Kyohei (Yoshio Harada), a taciturn retired doctor, presides over a reunion of his grown children and their own families. Naturally, old wounds are reopened and bitter words are exchanged.
Kore-eda, whose incomparable works range from the ethereal (Maboroshi) to the starkly real (Nobody Knows), invites inevitable connections between Still Walking and the work of Yasujiro Ozu, whose classic Tokyo Story is widely considered one of the best cinematic meditations on dysfunction and death.
Kore-eda’s earlier films kept their characters, who often occupy a bleak modern landscape, at a physical and emotional distance. Still Walking springs from the memories of Kore-eda’s own family life, and because of this the film has an honest, personal feel — something like an Ozu work.
Refreshingly, Kore-eda’s vision of dysfunction springs from the little cracks in the familial edifice that deepen drastically over lifetimes, rather than from the all-too-typical Wes Anderson style of grinding two unrealistically quirky personalities against one another. Watching the tiny clashes between bitter family members becomes painful in its reality, especially because Kore-eda pushes the audience forcefully into the lives of his characters.
At the core of Still Walking stands Hiroshi Abe as the son, Ryota, a character implicitly based on the filmmaker. The lanky, physically uncomfortable Ryota lives in the shadow of his dead brother, a local hero who had intended, unlike Ryota, to follow in his father’s footsteps as a doctor. Abe slowly-and-steadily builds the frustration Ryota feels wallowing in this shadow into a rage that explodes in the film’s most emotionally potent — and most satisfying — moment. Abe delivers a towering performance that unites the disparate relationships within the film.
It is to the director’s credit, however, that despite Ryota’s explosion at the film’s midpoint, Still Walking never again ventures into the realm of passionate melodrama. Kore-eda allows himself and the audience this one moment of release before everything is returned to the status quo that defines the film: a quiet bitterness that permeates — but does not control — almost every conversation. The slow pace and character-driven conversations allow the film to reveal itself carefully; characters are transformed by their words and actions over the course of the reunion.
Like Ozu with his great personal dramas, Kore-eda is never content to simply allow his images to wilt in the face of his excellent performers. The house that the film occupies becomes a character all its own and Kore-eda beautifully alternates between moments full of life and movement to visually empty scenes of off-screen dialogue or quiet contemplation. The way Kore-eda shoots the house and the people moving within it becomes an allegory for the frustrating, schismatic nature of family — a dynamic alternating between joy and sorrow, life and death.
Still Walking is almost never enjoyable as a work of entertainment, yet it has strong potential to resonate with anyone, dysfunctional family or not. Kore-eda fills his screen with enough realistic family unit types to create resonance within most viewers. Even grandmother Toshiko, who is about as vindictive as possible without veering into “wicked stepmother” territory, will inspire empathy in mothers who have buried their children.
The film misfires, however, in its tepid, overdrawn conclusion. Kore-eda strives too hard to make his messages about dysfunction and death obvious by including some previously unheard narration from Ryota. These scenes can be forgiven, yet Kore-eda should know better than to doubt the subtle potency of his actors and his writing.
The title of the movie comes from a ’70s Japanese pop song that Toshiko keeps as a subtle reminder of a dark time in her life. The song is an emblem of her bitterness, yet the lyric Kore-eda chose for his film’s title is more appropriate as a symbol for the director’s tragic realization of the inevitable progress of life.
About his film, he explains, “As an ungrateful eldest son who used the demands of his profession to excuse my long absences from home, I find myself troubled by regrets to this day.”
Family can be a bitter, unpleasant thing, but losing that bond is truly tragic.

USC has announced the beginning of an international search for a new dean for the Roski School of Fine Arts to replace Dean Ruth Weisberg who will be stepping down at the end of the school year to rejoin the faculty.
Weisberg began teaching at USC in 1970 and was named dean in 1995.
Stepping down · In her time at USC, Dean Ruth Weisberg pushed for the integration of technology and helped the school raise millions. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“It’s never a simple decision to make a significant change in one’s life. When I step down, I will have been dean for 15 years. That’s very unusual. Most deans serve for five or 10 years,” Weisberg said.
Provost C.L. Max Nikias approached Robert Cutietta, dean of the Thornton School of Music, to chair the search committee for the new dean. Cutietta is joined by Executive Vice Provost Barry Glassner — who will serve as vice chair — and nine other professors.
Cutietta’s appointment as chair of the search committee was appropriate, since he has been working closely alongside Weisberg from day one — ever since his interview for the deanship at Thornton eight years ago.
“The deans are very important at USC,” Cutietta said. “They make major decisions that impact the future of the school. Our goal is to really find a great person. And from a selfish point, I want somebody I can work with as well I worked with Ruth.”
While Weisberg said she is not endorsing any particular candidate, she hopes her successor will exhibit strong leadership capabilities.
“I think that deanships at USC require a certain kind of personality. The system at USC is very entrepreneurial and you need to have a real type-A personality, because we do a lot of fundraising and we have to be confident,” she said.
Indeed, it was Weisberg who was dean when the school received a $23 million donation from Gayle and Edward Roski, which renamed the school the Gayle Garner Roski School of Fine Arts. Cutietta considers Weisberg’s greatest accomplishment to be the naming of the school.
“Any time a dean gets a school named … It only happens once in the life of the school. And the school is 100 years old,” he said.
The donation from the Roskis, Weisberg said, allowed the school to bulk up its faculty considerably.
Less tangible, but equally admirable, Cutietta said, is how Weisberg was able to adapt when the introduction of the computer revolutionized art in the mid-1990s. No longer was art defined only by paintbrushes and acrylics; now it had to contend with the computer as a palette in its own right.
As the machine became another tool to generate art, Weisberg was able to prevent the school from going astray, Cutietta said.
“I think we’ve done something unusual that I’m rather proud of, which is that we’re very cutting edge. We do provide our students with the latest and very sophisticated technology.”
At the same time, the school hasn’t given up on the traditional skills and continue to offer hands-on drawing, painting and ceramics classes, Weisberg said.
Both Weisberg and Cutietta agreed that the new dean should also have high visibility in both the LA and national art scenes, as Weisberg does.
As dean, Weisberg continued to make and exhibit her art. Recently she was commissioned to do something completely new to her — construct a stained glass window for Judson Studios.
“It’s always good to be learning something new,” she said.
Though she enjoyed her time as dean, Weisberg said she is looking forward to returning to teaching.
“It’s been extremely rewarding to be dean,” Weisberg said. “I have wonderful colleagues, and we’ve made enormous progress in the last 15 years. I think it will be good to have fresh leadership; that’s always healthy.”
In fall 2008, Weisberg taught a course jointly offered by USC and Hebrew Union College for graduate students called Building Community: Jewish Cultural Resources, which focused on Jewish artwork. Once her deanship ends, she will resume
teaching studio art, a subject she said she loves, but was unable from teaching as a dean because of its intense time commitment.
Brianne Ryan, a sophomore majoring in fine arts with an emphasis in drawing, said, “I’m really sad that we’re losing her as a dean, but I’m excited that she’s going to be teaching. I really admire her work, and it would be wonderful to have her as a teacher.”
An announcement of the opening has already been posted on the website of Isaacson, Miller, the executive search firm assisting the search committee with advertising, maintaining high profile candidates’ confidentiality and finding qualified applicants.
The search will be conducted on an international scale and Cutietta and his team will be involved every step of the way, eventually narrowing the applicant pool down to four or five candidates.
Glassner said it is commonplace for top-tier universities to employ a search firm for a new dean. Isaacson, Miller also helped with the selection of Catherine Quinlan, the Dean of Libraries, in 2007.
“The whole goal is to hire the best dean throughout the world,” Glassner said.
Once the committee has whittled down its choices, the remaining candidates will come to campus to interact with students and faculty.
Glassner said Nikias will be advised by Gayle Roski, after whom the school is named, and President Steven B. Sample will make the final selection.  Cutietta expects the choice to be finalized in March. The new dean will take over July 1.

In hopes of intriguing and recruiting potential new members, one leadership fraternity tried to make a statement on Trousdale yesterday.
At 11:55 a.m. Thursday, members of Delta Omega Zeta, wearing green and white rush T-shirts, froze simultaneously in various positions on Trousdale: one student on his bike, another crouching down with a camera, another with a cookie halfway to her mouth — and one in a Speedo with “DO(e)Z” painted on his chest.
Frozen · A member of the leadership fraternity Delta Omega Zeta, wearing a DOZ shirt, stands frozen in place as students pass by her. - Nathan Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
DOZ — a co-ed leadership fraternity founded in the spring of 2008 during President Steven B. Sample’s “Art and Adventure of Leadership” course — has switched to what they call an alternative advertising campaign to boost their presence on campus and recruit a larger pledge class.
“We are trying to break out of the rush mold, and we are trying to make noise,” said Bernadette Anat, a junior majoring in public relations. “We’re trying to show that we are different and worthwhile.”
The members held their poses for approximately the minutes while other students walked by, heads turning, with some even taking photos or pointing.
“The flash mob demonstration was to exemplify the lack of fear to stand out that leaders have,” said Cory Welsh, DOZ communications chair and a junior majoring in communication.
In addition to the flash mob demonstration, DOZ has also launched a campus outreach strategy that reaches out to deans, clubs and organizations for personal recommendations of students who excel in student leadership.
President Phil Ehret, a senior majoring in psychology, said the group focuses on bringing student leaders together to network and build off of each others’ ideas.
DOZ leaders said so far, their tactics have seemed successful: last year, 182 students signed up during the entire rush process. This year, with five events left to go, 195 students have indicated interest.
“We still have a week of rush left,” Anat said. “Everything we are doing is really experimental, so there will be some stumbles, but we are working on the foundation of the group.”
DOZ’s rush approach stressed individuality; even their T-shirts, which say “A Leader DO(e)Z,” leave a blank for students to fill in their own answers with permanent marker.
“[The shirts] have an individual twist,” Welsh said. “Everyone had the ability to write whatever leadership means to them on their shirt.”
Angeli Agrawal, an undeclared freshman, said she is considering rushing DOZ after seeing the demonstration.
“It was a good campaign to catch people’s attention,” Agrawal said. “I almost ran into one of them. I might check them out now.”
The flash mob technique did not appeal to all students, however.
Heath Gilad, a sophomore majoring in political science, who walked between the posing DOZ members, said the performance didn’t convince him to rush the fraternity.
“Not if I have to do that — it just makes me laugh,” Gilad said.

The famine is over.
I don’t know how you survived, but you made it. The new dawn tomorrow brings a day that you’ve all been waiting eight months for — a day that seemed so far off in April, you wished you could just fall asleep and wake up on Sept. 5.
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Tomorrow, that insatiable hunger that you’ve felt since Jan. 2 will miraculously disappear, and you will finally get to indulge in the tailgates, burgers and beer.
But as you fill yourself up, you will have one eye on the clock, awaiting 12:30 p.m., because then comes the dessert you’ve been after. And when that time comes, when the whistle sounds and the ball is sent high above the Coliseum, you will stand there wide-eyed and cheer like a child on Christmas morning because it can only mean one thing: USC football is finally here.
Of course, this won’t be the same Trojans I or most of the nation expected to come out on the field. After Cary Harris intercepted Penn State QB Daryll Clark to end the Rose Bowl, I thought I had seen the last of one player but just the beginning of another.
I expected safety Taylor Mays, the only guy in college football that opponents escape from by running toward their own end zone, to take his bone-crushing hits to the NFL and leave a Mt. Wilson Observatory-sized hole in the secondary. But that was okay, because junior quarterback Mark Sanchez, who looked so flawless and unbeatable in the Rose Bowl, was expected to come back to an offense loaded with talent at the skill positions and in the trenches.
Obviously, as was played out in the offseason, neither of those expectations were fulfilled. Mays is here to break some more bones, and I won’t be shocked to see Jahvid Best or Terrelle Pryor take a page out of Beanie Wells’ book and injure a toe the week before they are scheduled to play against us. But two days after Mays announced his decision to stay, Sanchez decided to leave USC for greener uniforms, much to the chagrin of Pete Carroll and USC football fans.
Yet, USC fans should thank Sanchez rather than spite him, as it was because of his departure that we were able to survive one of the longest offseasons in college football history. In fact, yesterday’s official start to the college football season marked the latest opening day for Football Bowl Subdivision since 1981.
Sanchez’s departure meant that a new quarterback was to be chosen to lead the Trojans into the Coliseum tomorrow, and between redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp, redshirt junior Mitch Mustain and early-enrolled freshman Matt Barkley, there was no clear-cut favorite.
So, it was this quarterback competition that I lived on for eight months. First, Corp was named the starter in April. Then after three and a half months of inactivity, when I was relegated to watching reruns of the Rose Bowl on ESPNU, the first Coaches’ Poll of the season came out with USC ranked No. 4.
Three days later, Corp, and seemingly USC’s title hopes, went down when he cracked his fibula.
But Barkley was handed the reins to the team. This is a guy who went 6-for-12 for 57 yards and had an interception in the end zone in his first intrasquad scrimmage way back in April. Yet, his 10-for-17 for 154 yards and two-touchdown (one run and one pass) performance last weekend instilled a sense of anticipation that I haven’t felt on this campus since I arrived in 2007.
It’s not the anticipation that comes with the expectations of competing in the national championship four months down the road, because for the first time since 2006, nobody is predicting USC to play for the national title.
It’s an anticipation that USC fans want to see a team that they don’t really know the capabilities of. The Trojans are underdogs in the national landscape of college football and with a true freshman starting at quarterback for a top-five team for the first time since 1975, USC fans are excited about the history this team is capable of making.
USC football has finally arrived. I’m not sure what kind of team the Cardinal and Gold will be tomorrow (will they pass or run more?), and that adds to the excitement. I hope Barkley dominates in his first game, but the unknown adds a little something extra to the season opener: something that would’ve been missed had Sanchez stayed.
The Trojans are capable of dominating again. But will they dominate the Pac-10 and appear in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1? Or will they defy the nation’s expectations and march into the Rose Bowl on Jan. 7 playing for the national title? I don’t know the answer; we’ll just have to wait week-by-week to figure it out.
And that’s just how I like it.

Quentin Tarantino is such a punk.
Against all reason, Inglourious Basterds might just be cinema’s final word on World War II and the Holocaust. And, Tarantino is a punk for making it that way.
Without giving too much away by suggestion, the much-discussed ending of his highly stylized, spaghetti Western influenced movie explosively rewrites history.
Now, it’s one thing to remake history as propaganda or delusional fantasy, but Tarantino does it as pure entertainment. What Tarantino does to the memory of World War II in Inglorious Bastards — and if you haven’t seen it yet, put down the Daily Trojan, skip your next class and go to the theater — is not necessarily to cheapen it, but rather to end it. His finale is final, a curtain-closer on one of cinema’s most enduring topics and settings.
After all, how many more unique stories coming out of World War II and the Holocaust can there be? As the surviving generation disappears, what untold stories could possibly remain?
Certainly it would be an insult to the memory of such a horrific event for any nonparticipant to try and create an original story. Inglourious Basterds, as a treatise on the power cinematic fantasy can hold over history, stamps an exclamation point on the darkest period of modern history. Postmodern master Tarantino even had the gall to set the film’s climax in a movie theater, a choice that fills the proceedings with blatant subtext about the very nature of cinema.
Until Inglourious Basterds, Roman Polanski’s The Pianist might have rightfully been called cinema’s last substantive thesis on World War II and the Holocaust. For Polanski, whose entire career has illustrated the horrors and tragedies he suffered as a child in concentration camps, The Pianist was an artistic salvo by a true survivor against all films that would cheapen the memory of the event.
But Polanski’s film, like Tarantino’s and all other non-documentary films about the war, is essentially fiction — though of course it is based on a true story. Tarantino just takes Polanski’s thesis to its logical conclusion, using the power of cinema as history-changing fiction as a means to close a chapter of history recycled repeatedly by a culture obsessed with it.
So Tarantino is clearly an irreverent, annoying and uniquely brilliant punk. The asinine final line of Inglorious Basterds — a smug Brad Pitt staring into the camera and drawling out, “I think this might just be my masterpiece,” before a startling cut to Tarantino’s name in the credits — is a virtual ejaculation of the director’s massive, obnoxious ego.
Alas, for all its great importance as a work of art and politics, Inglourious Basterds still bears the curse that made his Kill Bill films inferior to Tarantino’s true masterpieces — Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. At this rate, he’ll never make any films to equal those two true masterpieces.
Sure, Inglourious Basterds will be long-remembered for the unique way it smashes history with the power of cinema — as well as for Christoph Waltz’s performance as the diabolical Nazi Col. Hans Landa — but the film showcases once again that Tarantino is spinning his wheels.
The director has built his career on the backs of filmmakers famous and infamous, with every frame of every film he’s ever seen influencing his choices as a director. Tarantino is some kind of savant; I remember Kurt Russell once telling a group of film journalists, “He’s got something with 24 frames a second, he’s a genius.” That perfectly sums up the brilliance of Tarantino, but it also pays tribute to his flaws — flaws that are becoming all the more evident with each film he makes.
Inglorious Basterds may be the director’s greatest ode to cinema, but by bogging down such a unique plot with pastiche — specifically, strikingly overt and distractingly out of place references to his favorite cinematic moments — he takes away from his own message. His first works used their references and riffs covertly, often in service of creating a more memorable shot or scene. With the Kill Bill films and his latest piece, Tarantino’s plot almost works in service of his movie reference file. To use a tiny example: in calling his protagonist Aldo Raine — a tribute to pretty-boy war movie veteran of yesteryear Aldo Ray — Tarantino draws attention to his passions in a disorienting way.
His films have been rightfully called masturbatory. Luckily for Tarantino, short of his overdone foot fetish, the kind of cinema that gets him off appeals to a broad range of filmgoers. From the first frame to the last, Inglourious Basterds is a work of pure, relentless entertainment. It is one of Tarantino’s most memorable works (though nowhere near his masterpiece), yet at the same time it shows a regression in his storytelling ability.
Only a brilliant punk like Tarantino could use cinema to tear down the World War II genre of film. Only a punk with an ego like Tarantino could bog down a great story with pastiche. He remains a true original — flawed, brilliant and always exciting.

Far away from the abundance of sloppy food that is EVK and the diner’s delight that is Parkside, the world is experiencing a hunger crisis.
According to the World Bank, although food prices have fallen from their peak in 2008, major grain prices remain high. Maize is 50 percent more expensive than its average price between 2003 and 2006, while rice prices are 100 percent higher. In the last two years, 130-155 million people lived in poverty due to these prices. These people can now be added to the 1.1 billion people who were living on less than $1 a day and the 923 million who were undernourished before the crisis hit.
A policy often touted by the United States as a “green initiative” is actually contributing to the problem. Our government actively encourages farmers to convert much of our corn harvest (60-70 percent of the world’s total) to ethanol. Unfortunately, not only does this hurt the environment, it also drives up food prices globally and exacerbates hunger in third world countries (something disputed by the US corn lobby, but agreed upon by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the International Food Policy Research Institute, among others).
In 2006, 14 percent of our corn was converted to ethanol. In 2008, it was 18 percent — this increase substantially affected world food prices. But this pales in comparison to what is coming: the 2007 US Energy Independence and Security Act calls for the current ethanol capacity of 6.5 billion gallons per year to increase to 36 billion gallons by 2022. If a 28 percent increase in our ethanol production can cause so much harm worldwide, imagine the ramifications of a 454 percent increase.
Now, maybe this mandated increase could be seen as reasonable if it could help stop global warming, saving lives in the process. However, it turns out that the process of creating corn ethanol emits more carbon into the atmosphere than is saved by putting it in cars and trucks. One study has found that it would take 167 years of ethanol use just to “pay back” the carbon emitted as a result of the deforestation its production causes. In addition, US tariffs keep out Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, whose production is up to eight times less harmful to the environment.
Ethanol’s potential is also limited — even if we switched our entire grain crop to ethanol, it would only replace 20 percent of our gasoline consumption.
In addition, America’s biofuels policy helped kill, at least for now, the Doha Development Round trade talks intended to give poor countries new chances to grow. Thus, not only are we increasing food prices, but we are hurting the poor’s opportunities to make money to buy that expensive food. Meanwhile, we are stunting our own growth by limiting free trade during our worst economic recession in 80 years.
The biofuels policy hurts the environment and world trade and increases world hunger — so why do we have it? More ethanol production means higher corn prices, which mean higher profits for agribusiness owners. These “farmers,” whose enormous corporations are in the process of crowding out the small family farms that Americans, for some reason, love to romanticize, have enormous political power because they control Iowa, where the first presidential primaries are.
In August, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley got the White House to promise that the ethanol tariff would remain in place in exchange for his support on the health care bill.
If you’re still reading, you’re probably asking yourself one of two questions — “Why should I care?” or “What can I do?”
You should care because our government is causing starvation worldwide and passing the buck on global warming just to enrich a small domestic group. You should care because starvation is the beginning of a story as often as it is the end of it — terrorism, civil wars and refugees are international security problems that directly threaten all of us and are frequently related to food shortages. And you should care because ethanol subsidies — the heart of America’s biofuel policy — cost the country a net $661 million each year.
Unfortunately, this ugly policy will be very hard to change because corn farmers care much more about its continuation than its opponents care about its termination. The only hope is in numbers — there are far more people who would benefit from the redirection of our corn crop back to food (for example, everyone in the world who isn’t a corn farmer) than there are beneficiaries of the status quo.
So spread the word. Write to your congressperson or senator. Tell your parents or your friends.
Most important, don’t participate in the system. Do not buy an ethanol-fueled car — the grain it takes to fill an SUV tank with ethanol could feed someone for a year, according to Foreign Policy Magazine.
The ethanol movement began as a well-intentioned effort to help the environment. However, now it is clear that it helps a very small group at a heavy price to the world’s poor, the environment and the US taxpayer. It is time for farmers to start leaving corn on the cob again.

It’s a strange place, that Hollyweird. Whatever name you prefer — Tinseltown, Lala Land, the Thirty-Mile-Zone — there’s no denying the uniqueness of this one California city. It is a place where fantasy fights reality and, more often than not, wins. The fantasy can vary, but make no mistake about it, only an elite inner circle is lucky enough to play the game.
Sometimes the fantasy is lovable and generic — “pursuing my dreams so I can make my family proud” — while other times it can be a bit more complex — “moving from a small town to LA so I could dance onstage with a stripper pole but still conceal myself as an innocent tween pop star.”
But for quite a few celebrities, a particular fantasy is taking the town by storm: “escaping punishment if I’m charged with assault, child molestation, cocaine possession or sex with a minor.”
I guess I forgot to mention, Hollywood is also the place where fantasy becomes real life.
When you’re rich and famous, all lines of rationality are completely disfigured — in your favor, of course. Which means our jaws shouldn’t totally hit the floor when famous individuals beat the system and bypass traditional consequences for the heavyweight crimes they commit. Sure, our court system has never been perfect nor will it ever be, but is there some fine print or special clause that us regular folk have been missing?
In a game of Monopoly, if we pull the wrong card, we commoners would go directly to jail, we would not pass go and would not collect $200. Celebrities might go to jail for 84 minutes (like Lindsay Lohan did), resurface to society and continue to take our money. With this in mind, the cynical average Joe can go about his normal business hating those who are wealthy and powerful and “have it so easy.”
Well, maybe not.
Though the court of law lets celebrities go free with nothing but a slap on the wrist (except for you, Paris Hilton), the court of public opinion finds itself more stuck in the middle, teetering on the fence of moral right and wrong. We want to and know we should condemn stars who commit horrible acts, but sometimes that is just not the case.
On Wednesday night, 20-year-old singer Chris Brown put on his best Mr. Rogers outfit — an Easter-colored sweater topped with a matching bowtie — to deliver his first televised interview on Larry King Live since last February’s highly publicized assault against then-girlfriend singer Rihanna.
After pleading guilty to his felony assault charge, he was sentenced to five years probation and six months community labor — a punishment many felt let Brown off the hook.
Accompanied by his mother and attorney, Brown, who grew up in a house filled with domestic violence, described his current feelings as shame and disappointment.
Unsurprisingly, the interview, with all its strategy blatantly exposed, seemed like it was pulled right out of Damage Control 101. Brown threw out various weak excuses for his behavior, such as “being young” and “relationships are hard.”
Now, it is certain that the general population will abhor any act of domestic violence regardless of the fact that two megastars were involved. Because of the latter detail, however, everything changes.
The easy answer is that we should never support Brown again nor listen to his music. How could anyone support a man who chokeholds and headlocks someone who can so masterfully sing about umbrellas? Unfortunately for us, the situation isn’t easy.
Many of us found ourselves guiltily holding back tears after Brown’s mother gave an impassioned speech or sheepishly melting after Brown admitted to still being in love with Rihanna (cue the “ooh”s and “aah”s). We scratched our heads and thought: does he deserve a second chance?
Brown’s circumstances and quest for a public reexamining are not uncommon for Hollywood. Singer R. Kelly, who in 2007 somehow escaped serving time for his multiple counts of child pornography and engaging in sex acts with a minor, enjoyed several Billboard chart-topping records. His music career was not compromised.
Same goes for the late Michael Jackson, whose achievements have been celebrated around the clock since his death. Though the 2005 trials and accusations of child molestation plagued part of Jackon’s buzz in the media, they had minimal impact on the discussions of his life. This week, Whitney Houston, who for years battled drug rumors, released her comeback album and will once again claim her spot at number one. And even popular homemaker Martha Stewart, after her criminal stint with obstruction of justice, found herself with a still-popular magazine, a rebuilt empire and six months worth of street cred.
Generally, we would not condone the actions of convicted pedophiles, junkies or crooks, yet the public’s embrace has shown these mistakes as forgivable. Are abusive boyfriends just as lucky?
It can still be argued that just because they live in this alternate universe, no special treatment is deserved. This is true, but the public can’t seem to make up its mind. We allow icons of pop culture to send us on an emotional rollercoaster that pulls at our heartstrings and forces us reconsider our morals.
If Brown can produce more hits (musically, of course) that tap into that public emotion, he just may be forgiven.

Pete Carroll’s debut as USC’s coach seems distant, but his first game still evokes clear memories for the nine-year leader of the Trojans.
San Jose State came to Los Angeles in 2001 to face a USC team that was coming off a 5-7 season and had little reason for optimism. The Coliseum was at less than half capacity for the opener with an announced crowd of 45,568.
Stage is set · All eyes will be on true freshman quarterback Matt Barkley, especially against a San Jose St. defense known for blitzing. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan
“It was so quiet you could hear the band play every time,” Carroll said.
A sellout crowd isn’t expected for Saturday’s game — tickets were still available for purchase as of Thursday afternoon — but plenty has changed for the team in the eight years since it last faced the Spartans. Expectations ride high again for No. 4 USC, which will face San Jose State at the Coliseum on Saturday at 12:30 p.m.
Matt Barkley will become the first true freshman to start an opener at quarterback for USC in the program’s history, as well as the first to start the season for a top-10 team since Chad Henne opened for Michigan in 2004.
Past USC quarterbacks such as Mark Sanchez, John David Booty and Matt Leinart have used their debuts as starters in season openers as a spring board to season-long success. But Carroll admitted that Barkley would have to mature quickly because of his inexperience.
“We don’t feel any differently about it than we felt with other guys,” Carroll said. “He’s just impressed us from the first day he got here, and he won the job under the circumstances.”
Despite having his team enter the game as a 33-point favorite, Carroll said his team has a significant road block ahead of it in the Spartans defense. San Jose State coach Dick Tomey was the architect of Arizona’s “Desert Swarm” defense in the ‘90s.
Tomey brought his all-out blitzes with him to San Jose and helped his team finish 10th in the country in pass defense last year and 11th in sacks.
“I grew up watching it, and it’s a challenge,” said quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates of Tomey’s defensive system.
Tomey said he wouldn’t plan differently for Barkley than he would any other quarterback.
“We come after all quarterbacks. I don’t care if they play five years, 10 years, no years,” he said. “That’s just the way we have played.”
Saturday will also serve as an introduction to USC’s fresh-faced defense. The unit is facing even more changes than expected after Shareece Wright was announced academically ineligible and Derek Simmons was ruled out with a sprained ankle.
USC’s defense did receive a boost on Thursday, though, when it was announced that linebacker Luthur Brown had been cleared to play in the opener after sitting out training camp because of academic concerns. The veteran Brown adds experience to a linebacking group that is attempting to replace its three starters from last year.
Injuries and instability forced San Jose State’s offense to limp to 112th in the country last season in total offense. Jordan La Secla and California transfer Kyle Reed are expected to rotate at quarterback on Saturday.
Both of San Jose State’s starting wide receivers sat out most of last year due to injury. But Kevin Jurovich, who had more than 1,000 yards receiving in 2007, and Jalal Beauchman will be ready on Saturday.
Running back Patrick Perry will also play for the Spartans for the first time since 2006 after being granted a sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA. Perry will look to boost the San Jose State rushing attack, which averaged less than 87 yards per game last season.

In an effort to more effectively monitor rowdy behavior during football games, the Department of Public Safety has teamed up with the Office of Student Affairs to offer an anonymous texting application that will alert authorities to inappropriate fan behavior.
The application, which will be available starting at Saturday’s game against San Jose State, will allow fans to notify DPS of any unruly or disruptive behavior through a text, instead of calling or looking for officers patrolling the stands.
“We already had a phone system, so it just seems like a logical next step to add texting to the phone capabilities,” said DPS Chief Carey Drayton. “In the crowded Coliseum, it’s probably easier to articulate what you want to say in a text.”
Any visitor to the Coliseum who feels a fan’s behavior is getting out of hand can text the number 274637 with “TC4T” in the body of the message along with a description of the situation and the location. DPS will then send an officer to handle the situation.
Lynette Merriman, senior associate dean of students for Student Affairs, said texts sent from football games will go to DPS first, and Student Affairs will be called in if DPS determines they need extra resources.
“We partner with DPS in a lot of our endeavors,” said Merriman. “The text will first go to DPS. If Public Safety realizes that the support and resources of Student Affairs would help in the response to that student, we will be notified right away.”
The texting service is being offered under the umbrella of the Trojans Care for Trojans program. Launched last October, TC4T gives students the ability to anonymously alert Student Affairs about students in need of counseling so administrators and faculty can take measures to help them. Formally adding DPS to TC4T will help widen Student Affairs’ reach to include more immediate situations, such as those at football games.
Many students said they thought the texting system would be effective in the regular reserved seating but that it might be misused in the student section.
“I think people might abuse it,” said Emily Levitan, a junior majoring in communication and theatre. “I feel like it wouldn’t be used the way they want it to.”
Some, like Blaise Brunda, said they worried that texting would not work in the Coliseum, where many providers do not get service.
“How would [students] even know that they are supposed to text to begin with?” said Brunda, a senior majoring in business administration. “And there’s the fact that we don’t get cell reception. I never get it.”
Drayton said there would be an advertisement during the game to tell students about the texting system and the number they should send messages to.
He also added that students can continue using the old way of reporting rowdy fans by searching out an officer in the stands if their cell phone does not have service in the Coliseum.
“If a phone doesn’t work you can get up and find someone in a yellow jacket or uniform,” Drayton said. “I don’t control all aspects of technology. I can’t control what Verizon and AT&T do or what kind of service they provide on any given day.”
According to Drayton, the Coliseum Commission is working to improve phone problems with many big providers, and the situation might improve throughout the season.
To further ensure safety at the games, DPS has also added a surveillance camera to the Coliseum to specifically monitor areas that have seen a higher level of unruly behavior.
“After someone reports this, we can keep the camera in that area for a little bit of time so that if there is any retaliation in that area, we’ll have it on tape,” Drayton said. “We already have an operational video that we scan the crowd with.”

The USC women’s soccer team started the season at No. 8 in the nation, and expectations were high considering seven starters were coming back from a team that went 16-5-2 last year.
But now after two games (three if you count the 2-0 exhibition loss to the Mexican national team last weekend), the unranked USC is 0-2, troubled with injuries and just looking for a spark.
Righting the ship · Marihelen Tomer and the Women of Troy look to get back on track against San Diego and Cal State Fullerton. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“We’ve beaten ourselves in the last two games,” redshirt senior forward Marihelen Tomer said. “Sometimes the results don’t go your way. But I think we haven’t been playing our best soccer or close to what we need to be playing..”
The Women of Troy are hoping to showcase an improved team this weekend as they travel to the University of San Diego to play in the USD Nike Classic, where they will face two teams that finished last season with losing records. USC will play Cal State Fullerton (0-2) on Friday and Ohio State (1-1-1) on Sunday.
However, even with these winnable games, the Women of Troy need to put the ball in the back of the net. They have been outscored 5-1 this season, and the lone goal came on junior Megan Ohai’s penalty kick in a 2-1 loss to St. John’s last Sunday. Yet, USC outshot the Red Storm 23-6.
“The result on Sunday, as much as it stung us and was disappointing, I think there’s a lot of valuable lessons we can take from that game,” coach Ali Khosroshahin said.
Part of the reason for the slow start for USC could be attributed to injuries and new players getting adjusting to the college game. Redshirt senior and All-American center back Meagan Holmes sprained her MCL last weekend against Mexico and is day-to-day, and junior center back Kasey Johnson is unavailable.
This means that last year’s leading points scorer, junior Ashli Sandoval, will play center back (she played this position over the summer and in Sunday’s game) along with two sophomores that saw little playing time last year, Claire Schloemer and Chelsea Buehning.
“We haven’t had a solid backline. People have been getting hurt, and people are moving different positions,” said junior defender Karter Haug, the only backline returner scheduled to play Friday.
Transitioning from offense to defense and from defense to offense has also been a spot the Women of Troy are looking to improve on. Often times this season, USC has gotten up in the attack but would only have one or two players in the penalty box as a cross came in.
The effect is more profound on defense, as the Women of Troy’s new backline still tries to find chemistry that only comes by gaining experience and playing together. Having an All-American at goalkeeper, senior Kristin Olsen, provides some insurance, but Khosroshahin sees a fundamental aspect in the transition game that everyone can work on.
“I think we’ve been reacting a lot and depending on our athleticism to get it done, but at this level athleticism isn’t enough. You gotta rely on intelligence, and that’s what we’re lacking right now,” he said.
Khosroshahin knows the only way to get his new players to learn this is to have them gain collegiate experience. While he desperately wants to win every game, he knows that the team is young and different. He is confident the team will be fine as the season progresses.
The Women of Troy stopped short of saying these are must-win games, but after an 0-2 start, coming off with two wins in winnable games would be a great boost for the whole team.
“I think [the wins] are going to come if we keep improving and working on the things we haven’t done well,” Tomer said. “We’re 0-2, so two wins would be nice.”

If The Avett Brothers were Huckleberry Finn, then legendary record producer Rick Rubin is its successful Widow Douglas.
The North Carolina-based band has been creating its unrefined folk-punk for the last nine years, but after signing to Columbia imprint American Recordings and heading into the studio with Rubin, the band’s core members finally learned to play in time and in tune.

“When we first started, it was very raw,” stand-up bass player Bob Crawford said, “but that was the appeal. We were doing the best we could with what we had.”
Raised on everything from Nirvana to Bruce Springsteen, The Avett Brothers’ three core members — including band-namesakes Seth and Scott Avett who play acoustic guitar and banjo, respectively — infused their rock roots with the Southern sounds of bluegrass and folk.
A heavy punk influence is also evident, not only in their grassroots beginnings, but also in The Avett Brothers’ live shows where members often end up jumping into the crowd or writhing on the floor with their instruments.
After meeting through a mutual friend and playing acoustic bluegrass together during a late night parking lot rendezvous in Charlotte, N.C.  Crawford and the Avetts started writing songs. For several years, they played in local bars and toured East Coast colleges, giving string-snapping, banjo-shredding shows to anyone who would watch, eventually taking their romanticized lyrics about pretty girls and cars on self-booked national tours.
But after releasing 10 albums and one EP in under a decade, the The Avett Brothers’ upcoming major label debut is its most mature yet, thanks to producer Rubin whose experience in the industry helped the band spruce up its self-described guerilla recording tactics — 2006’s Four Thieves Gone was made in a rented house — and create songs cleaner than they had ever considered possible.
“There are sonic and aural things that we don’t understand about making a record,” Crawford said. “You think you know a song when you decide to record it and you think that what you’ve been doing will read well on a record, but it may not. And so working with Rick [Rubin] was amazing to teach us about that.”
The Avett Brothers have also matured in other ways, straying more and more from their bluegrass roots by “building up,” “expanding” and “electrifying,” according to Crawford. This includes adding members — a cellist and a drummer now tour with them — and embracing a more rock-inspired sound that will add versatility to an already multifaceted band.
“We’d like to be able to record work that displays and represents several different aspects of the dynamic spectrum,” Crawford said. “After working with Rick it’s hard to think of going back to [how we used to make records]. Now we have the means to make a well thought out sonically intelligent album and we need to embrace that.”
The Avett Brothers play at the Orpheum Theatre Saturday, 8 p.m.

Five hundred and thirty-six horsepower. 551 lb-ft torque. 191 mph top speed. The 2009 Cadillac CTS-V delivers nothing but joy out of its 6.2L supercharged V8, coupled with a six-speed manual, fully synchronized with two overdrive gears. Engineers have poured their hearts and souls into this performance machine.
The result: 0 to 60 in 3.9 seconds and the quarter mile in 12 seconds flat. But wait, it gets better. The performance tuned CTS-V completed Germany’s famed Nürburgring race track in an astonishing 7:59.32, putting to rest any notion that American cars can only move in straight lines.

The trade-in value for all this? $4,500.
At least that’s what you would’ve received under the government’s Cash for Clunkers (CARS) bill a few weeks ago. That’s right. The 15 miles per gallon rating on the Cadillac CTS-V basically makes it a clunker, a fact so bothersome that Gregg Easterbrook, a sports enthusiast of all people, took time to point this out.
Alright, so no one in their right mind considers this car a clunker, but people have every right to be enraged that while their tax dollars kept GM afloat, they continued working on this behemoth. Certainly this is upsetting, but to focus solely on what went wrong with this government program ignores everything it did right. From a purely financial standpoint, the CARS program should be considered a success despite small speed bumps like the Cadillac CTS-V.
Although cynics will point out that the $3-billion bill is just another example of the wasteful government spending that led to the unprecedented trillion-dollar deficit the United States is facing and that it has driven up our taxes, the reality is that CARS has generated tremendous profit. Nearly 700,000 cars were sold, keeping dealerships in business by moving idle inventory that would otherwise cost them up to 25 percent of the car’s face value. This outweighs the short-term cash flow problems dealers are currently facing as they check their mail daily for rebate money.
Not to mention, it was a better way to keep jobs alive in the auto industry than just giving the money directly to car companies as was done during the bailouts. In this manner, car companies must pour their shared profits into restocking vehicles and keeping manufacturers that build foreign and domestic vehicles in business too, while customers get to upgrade their vehicles.
Obviously, this comes at an expense to the American taxpayer, but let’s face it: citizens can’t pay taxes if they don’t have salaries.
Some activists are in fits regarding the manner in which used cars are disposed. Their key piece of evidence remains a popular YouTube video demonstrating a clunker’s engine being disabled. A liquid composite is poured into the engine then revved at high RPM until the engine fails, as evidenced by clouds of white pollution spewing out of the exhaust and engine.
Again, though, the benefits outweigh the detriments.
Each traded-in car averaged a 9 mpg upgrade to its fuel economy. Based off an average 12,000 miles driven annually by Americans, this equates to 278 gallons per year saved per vehicle. Multiply this by the nearly 700,000 cars sold, and the public is looking at about 190 million gallons of fuel saved. Moreover, those 278 gallons annually saved 2.8 tons of carbon dioxide from being released. Across the total vehicles sold, the environment was spared 390 million pounds of carbon dioxide. Of course, these figures are approximate and just for one year. It’s safe to bet the clunkers traded would’ve been around for a couple more years. These savings, however, help justify the manner in which the cars were disabled.
Cheaper alternatives like rebates for low-income drivers or higher gas guzzler taxes may have been just as good for the environment, but the financial boost to the economy would’ve been lost. When the environmental aspects to the bill are considered along with the financial benefits, CARS is about as successful as a stimulus program can be.
Hopefully, the success of CARS can calm the public’s inherent opposition towards government programs that enter the private sector and help convince citizens that big changes, like health care reform, actually have a shot at success.
