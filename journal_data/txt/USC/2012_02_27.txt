When people discuss the University Park area, they sometimes disparage the “University of South Central” as an unsafe urban environment stricken with high crime rates.
Eddie North-Hager, associate director of media relations, works to counter this stereotype that he said comes from major news outlets’ scant coverage of South Los Angeles by providing a place to showcase local news.
Community · Eddie North-Hager, associate director of media relations, has created the website UniversityParkFamily.com to reverse stereotypes about South Central. - Jessica Badrous | Daily Trojan
“So often in our neighborhood, the press only covers things when they’re newsworthy enough for the whole city, which is usually crime,” North-Hager said. “Crime in this area has been reduced drastically since 2001, but we still have this feeling that it’s of epidemic proportions.”
North-Hager created the website UniversityParkFamily.com in 2009 to allow community members to act as citizen journalists by sharing news and upcoming events specific to the University Park area. He calls it part news, part social networking.
“Facebook focuses on yourself or your circle of friends,” North-Hager said. “University Park Family focuses on the neighborhood, and it involves the neighborhood to focus on the one thing they have in common, which is their geographic location.”
University Park Family, which has about 500 members, goes beyond the interests of USC students. Instead, it is a place for community members, who make up more than half of users, to connect by sharing information others might have never found.
North-Hager began working for USC media relations six years ago, around the same time he moved to Leimert Park and created LeimertParkBeat.com, the first of several websites like University Park Family.
“People choose to live here because they love the area, but being involved can be really hard,” North-Hager said. “I was new to the area, and I didn’t want to be an authoritative voice in their lives, rather I wanted us to be able to share everybody’s strength in a central place.”
North-Hager said his own experience as a community journalist showed him the value of allowing members of the community to act as citizen journalists themselves.
He grew up in Tucson, Ariz., where he began working for the local newspaper while in high school and got a bachelor’s degree in journalism from the University of Arizona. His first full-time job was with the Idaho Press Tribune as a community reporter, in a town he said was much smaller than the University Park area.
“At one time, most large neighborhoods had some kind of a personal news outlet,” he said. “I think that most of them could use one today too.”
He was working for the Daily Breeze in the South Bay when he made the switch from reporting to public relations in 2006 because of his worries about the future of daily newspapers.
While North-Hager recognizes that many journalists see making the transition to public relations as “going to the dark side,” he said his job at USC has never made him question his values, but rather has allowed him to use skills he learned from his years as a reporter.
“I haven’t bent my principles as a media relations person once,” he said. “As a good press release, you’re not there to write it, you’re there to report it. You have to put out the news very quickly and at a level a 10th-grader would understand.”
One of the benefits of his transition was the opportunity to further his education at USC. He said each semester the university provides one tuition-free class to employees. North-Hager used his free classes toward his masters in communication management. For his final project in 2009, he and his team created another similar website for Echo Park, and during the past few years, he has created websites for Rancho Park, San Pedro and Culver City.
Now, North-Hager uses his knowledge of USC to enhance the University Park experience for all users. He frequently posts information that most USC students hear about, such as street closures affecting regular traffic, that community members might not see until they happen.
Because of his work with the community, he was asked to join the neighborhood commission, something his boss encouraged.
“At USC, we want to give you the tools to be a great person and that doesn’t just mean make money,” he said. “We want you to be part of the community.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety Daily Incident Log between Friday, Feb. 24, and Monday, Feb. 27. 

View Roundup 02-28 in a larger map
Crimes against a person
At 8:34 p.m. on Feb. 26, a student reported that a suspect slapped her buttocks while she was standing on Orchard Avenue.  The suspect appeared to be intoxicated and she made a vaguely threatening statement before she walked away and disappeared from sight.
At 5:26 a.m. on Feb. 26, a student reported that a cab driver sprayed him with pepper spray when he refused to pay his fare.  The student did not require medical treatment, and he was unable to provide DPS officers with a description of the driver, his vehicle or the cab company name.
At 1:07 a.m. on Feb. 26, a suspect smashed the front passenger side window to gain entry to a car at Felix Chevrolet and removed a vehicle owner’s manual, a pair of headphones and a cable.
Crimes against property
At 10:50 a.m. on Feb. 25, a suspect climbed through an unsecured window to gain entry at 1163 29th St., and removed two laptop computers, three iPods, two cellular phones, a television and two watches.
At 12:18 p.m. on Feb. 24, DPS officers responded to a report of two suspects prowling in the bike racks outside Leavey Library and upon their arrival, they observed one of the subjects toss a duffel bag into some nearby shrubs.  The officers detained the suspects for questioning and both of them denied ownership of the bag, which contained three bicycle seats and a cell phone.  The officers were unable to locate the owners of the property to determine if a crime had occurred and the suspects were subsequently released.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 5:28 p.m. on Feb. 26, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained a possible broken nose when he was struck in the face by a football that a juvenile threw at him on 28th and Orchard streets.  The juvenile admitted throwing the football when contacted by the officers, but the student did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter.  The officers then transported the student to Kaiser Hospital for medical treatment.
At 6:13 a.m. on Feb. 26, DPS officers responded to a student who reported that she had taken an overdose of her prescription medication.  An LAFD R.A. unit was requested and Unit #15 responded.  The R.A. Unit examined the student and transported her to Good Samaritan Hospital for medical treatment.
At 2:17 a.m.  on Feb. 25, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student who was reported to be unable to care for himself at Seeley G. Mudd building. The student was conscious and coherent when contacted by the officers and he declined transportation for medical treatment.  The student was released into the care of a friend.

The elected members of Undergraduate Student Government, whose positions will be official  on Tuesday, receive stipends paid by the undergraduates of the student body through the $57.50 student programming fee.
This year, USG President Monish Tyagi will receive $11,032 and USG Vice President Logan Lachman will receive $8,826 in compensation. The presidential and vice presidential stipends were $10,000 and $8,000 for the 2006-2007 academic year but have been adjusted for cost of living each year.
The 12 USG Senators each receive $2,206, USG and Program Board directors receive $4,413 and other USG officials receive comparable stipends. The executive director of Program Board receives the same stipend as the USG vice president.
Nearly half of the $1.8-million budget goes to Program Board, which  is overseen by USG and consists of committees and assemblies tasked with creating events for the student population.
“The USG-funded events are open to all undergraduates,” said USG Treasurer Elton Kwok. “Anything that USG funds — go ahead and go to those events and student activities. There’s concerts, free shows, discussions and a lot of people don’t take advantage of the fact that their student activity fee goes toward these events.”
USG allocates its budget at the end of the academic year by assuming there will be 15,000 undergraduates paying the student programming fee. The treasurer adjusts the allocations once the actual number of undergraduates is determined.
This year, about $75,000 of almost $90,000 in originally unallocated funds went to program board assemblies. Even when determining the budget last year, USG increased funding for several Program Board assemblies and committees.
The Black Student Assembly added $20,000 to its $45,000 budget, the Asian Pacific American Students Assembly added $13,500 to its $57,000 budget and the Academic Culture Assembly added $7,000 to its $38,000 budget.
Several committees also received more funds, as the Special Events Committee budget went from $49,500 to $67,000 and Trojan Pride’s funds grew from $25,000 to $29,500. The Concerts Committee budget increased from $215,000 to $250,000 because its events are some of USG’s “best attended,” Kwok said.
Each assembly reports attendance and estimates the cost per attendee for each of the more than 2,000 events held by Program Board assemblies and committees. Trojan Pride estimates a 67-cent cost per head, while the Women’s Student Assembly averaged $60 so far this year, which Kwok said will likely be less by the end of the year.
“Most of the assemblies spend about $5 to $10 per head,” Kwok said. “With concerts and performing arts, you’re paying for a name, so it’s [more expensive]. If students go to three or four of those events each semester, they’re getting their money’s worth.”
This year, USG has saved some money by renegotiating the cost of legal counseling services, which are available to students on Mondays. USG split that service fee and some administrative costs with the Graduate Student Government because many graduate students use the legal service and USG shares an office with GSG, Kwok said. The negotiations ended in November.
USG also saved money by integrating administrative costs with Program Board because the two moved into the same office last year but had not changed the budget to reflect this until this year.
President Monish Tyagi said this shows “streamlining” with Program Board.
“One of our biggest goals is for everyone to see how it’s all one organization,” Tyagi said. “It’s a great internal step for office needs to start coming through one administrative budget.”
Kwok said that USG went through the budget line by line to determine changes before submitting its proposal to the senate, which unanimously approved it last April.
“We really looked at how an assembly or committee performed in the past years,” Kwok said. “We made sure that the new initiatives or programming events that attracted more crowds would be continued.”
Michael Jackson, vice president for Student Affairs, said undergraduate students manage the funds well.
“The budget is sound and focuses spending on the priorities that student leaders and the university think are important,” Jackson said. “We appreciate the diligence of those who developed the budget and the serious way they carried out their work.”
Though the programming fee increased $1 last year to account for inflation, adding around $42,000 to the budget, several organizations under USG have seen increases of different proportions based on each organization’s performance.
“We looked at the different committees and the line items that are going to benefit the most students possible,” Tyagi said. “We want to make sure we give all those areas an adequate amount of money to fund activities and programs for the students we represent.”

USC freshmen Gabriella DeSimone and Roberto Quiroz earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors as members of their respective tennis squads.
Both players played key roles in each team’s two victories last week and have contributed in a spring season that has seen the teams tally a combined 22-1 overall record and maintain a top-10 ranking in the nation.
Best in the west · Freshman Roberto Quiroz was named conference player of the week after improving his record on the season to 13-2. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
DeSimone clinched two victories for the women’s team with two singles wins over opponents from No. 5 California and UC Santa Barbara. In the upset victory over the Golden Bears, DeSimone defeated Cecilia Estlander 7-5, 6-2 for USC’s 4-2 advantage, improving No. 7 USC to 9-1 overall.
Two days earlier, DeSimone rallied for a 2-6, 6-1, 6-0 comeback victory over Paola Cos of UC Santa Barbara en route to USC’s 7-0 sweep. With the two singles wins, DeSimone now stands at 13-5 overall and 8-1 in dual matches.
Quiroz also clinched a victory for the Trojans with a 6-1, 6-3 singles win over Ricky Baylon of San Diego State. His efforts on court three were a part of his two doubles and two singles wins for No. 1 USC (13-0) in a doubleheader last Friday against No. 24 San Diego and San Diego State.
Hours later, Quiroz took down San Diego’s Ciaran Fitzgerald 6-3, 6-1 after earning his second doubles win of the day with No. 47 sophomore Emilio Gomez.
Quiroz, who was the only Trojan to see the court four times on Friday, improved to 13-2 overall and 10-1 in dual matches. In doubles, he and his cousin Gomez hold an 11-3 overall and 9-2 dual match record.
DeSimone and Quiroz hope to put up similar efforts this week when both teams face off against UCLA. The Trojans will take on the No. 8 Bruins at the Los Angeles Tennis Center on Wednesday at  2 p.m. while the USC women will host the No. 3 Bruins at Marks Stadium on Thursday at 1:30 p.m.

Every time the USC baseball team has taken the field this year, they have left with a win. Seven games and seven victories mean that for the first time since 1988, USC baseball is 7-0. The 1988 team ended up 15-0 before finally dropping a game, so this 2012 team has its work cut out if it wants to match that record.
Tuesday afternoon, the Trojans begin their toughest week of the season as they travel to Malibu to face Pepperdine at 2 p.m.
The tough stretch continues this weekend when they travel to North Carolina to take on the No. 6 Tar Heels in a three-game set, and will come to a close a week from today when the Trojans host No. 17 Cal State Fullerton back at Dedeaux Field.
With two ranked teams on the horizon, it would seem fairly easy to look past the Waves (6-2), but one look at the Waves’ record indicates that would be a bad idea.
“Pepperdine has played really, really well this year,” USC coach Frank Cruz said. “We’re gonna have to be really prepared, really focused and just execute.”
“Just execute” is exactly what the Trojans have done this year, getting both expected and unexpected contributions.
Among those expected: right fielder Alex Sherrod. While the senior hit just .259 to start the year, he is tied for the team lead in RBIs with seven and homers with two, including a mammoth grand slam against Akron on Sunday.
“Winning makes everything better,” Sherrod said. “It makes you feel 10 pounds lighter. We dance in the locker room after wins. It’s just fun.”
But for every player like Sherrod, who is an experienced senior and expected to make a significant contribution, there are also younger players who have stepped cleanly and successfully into their roles.
Freshman Dante Flores has established himself as the starting second baseman, and freshman Garrett Stubbs, recruited as a catcher, has locked down center field.
“I’d never played center field before in my life,” Stubbs said. “I’d actually never even played outfield in general.”
Stubbs has turned into a bit of a prodigy. He not only bats leadoff, but he is hitting .346 and has a .500 on-base percentage.
“It’s been pretty unbelievable,” Stubbs said of his first few weeks as a Trojan. “It’s just fun to be around all of these guys and winning a lot.”
Players like Stubbs are one of the principal reasons for the Trojans’ success: They simply don’t make outs. As a team, the players’ on-base percentage is an incredible .450. Stubbs is just one of five players with an on-base percentage above .500, led by sophomore walk-on left fielder Kevin Swick’s .556.
Both Swick and Stubbs are incredibly versatile players. Stubbs has played catcher, left field and center field. Swick can play both left field and third base. Senior catcher Kevin Roundtree can also play either corner infield position. Junior third baseman Adam Landecker can play both shortstop and second base as well.
Perhaps most impressive is the versatility of senior Brandon Garcia. On the weekends he serves as the Trojans’ designated hitter and leads the team in both slugging and walks. Today, he will take the mound for his second start of the season in his second year as USC’s midweek starter.

Student-athletes are some of the hardest working individuals on college campuses. In some cases, athletes are up before dawn to attend early morning weight training and practices. After practice, they are expected to attend a full day of classes, before repeating the schedule the following day.
Without a doubt, college athletes are living demanding lives. Though some student-athletes argue they are able to live out their dreams by playing a sport at the next level and profiting from the notoriety that they might gain from their sport, some are left wondering whether student-athletes should receive more benefits, aside from tuition and stipends.
In need · Many scholar athletes, including those at USC, are not able to function on the NCAA’s monthly stipend. Currently, the stipend is $2,000, which oftentimes is not enough for the athletes, especially in high-priced cities like Los Angeles. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Recently, the NCAA has been evaluating whether the stipends are sufficient considering the current climate for college athletes. Currently, the monthly stipend for college athletes is $2,000. For athletes in metropolitan areas like USC, not much is left from the stipend once rent and expenses are paid. Because of this discrepancy, many athletes have demanded a change in the current system because of its flaws. For the current system to be truly functional, drastic changes need to be made.
Some advocates have suggested that student-athletes should be paid for their athletic endeavors by their universities. But this proposal has been immediately shot down becuase paying college-level athletes violates the concept of “amateurism” in college athletics. Another immediate criticism stems from the fact that at certain universities, some sports are more prosperous than others. The revenue gained from country-wide (and even worldwide) popular sports like football or basketball is often used to fund other sports on the campus.
Other proposals to fix the stipend issue have suggested following a system similar to the Olympics. Student-athletes would be able to benefit from being sponsored from interested companies supplementing tuition and monthly stipends. Athletes would be able to benefit from his or her athletic achievements, granting them ease of mind and ease of their wallets while they are in school.
Ideally, this is the best scenario. Athletes from all areas of the sports spectrum would be able to benefit from this advantageous change. The athletes would be able to focus on their sport and most importantly — education.
Though it might take years before a full reform is implemented, change needs to occur immediately. To greatly impact and alleviate the issue, the NCAA should change the monthly stipend to accommodate the variance in the cost of living among college towns. The stipend needs to be adapted to the location of the university. This instant fix will ease the flaws in the current system.
Yes, many will object to the notion of providing student-athletes with more than the stipend or reformed stipend system. Do not be quick to forget that it is the athletes who are generating the revenue for his or her university. In today’s system, not one college athlete receives a single dollar from sale of merchandise that possesses his or her image. Shouldn’t they receive some type of incentive because it is the athletes who are driving the consumers in purchasing the product?
Most importantly, is it truly fair to not give credit where it is due? After all, it is student-athletes like Kendall Bateman, Christina Marinacci, Maurice Jones and Matt Barkley that keep the Trojan tradition alive and prevalent in USC and collegiate athletics.

Agree, agree, agree! And few student athletes have any form of scholarship outside of football and basketball.
First, this article doesn’t clarify that these $2000/month stipends are only for football and basketball players who are also on full scholarships (valued at close to $35K/year), have training tables (free food) and have all their books paid for.
If there are to be any changes, it needs to be that ALL student-athletes get the same benefits not just the marquee sports.  (And don’t tell me that football makes all the money… while that may be true, part of the issue is that colleges and the media don’t actively promote their other sports… judging from the numbers of people who watch the Olympics, there is definitely an audience for other sports especially aquatic sports, tennis, golf and track).
For instance, our son is a USC water polo player with four championship rings and many could argue his team is comprised of some of the finest athletes in the world.  But there’s no $2000/mo stipend and no training table.   And he lives with 3 other athletes in a small home so that his rent is $400/month… frankly, $2000/mo would be more than he’d need if he had the same benefits as the football players.
So rather than give more to those that already have more than they need, let’s share the wealth, yes?
“Shouldn’t they receive some type of incentive because it is the athletes who are driving the consumers in purchasing the product?”
Aren’t most of the student-athletes already receiving free tuition, tutoring service, coaching, etc.?  So now you want to turn an educational institution into a sports franchise?
This is the main reason why I dont buy a player’s jersey or any oer mrchandise that has his/her name or photo.  They dont get a share of the revenue, so why buy it?  The school is making plenty of money from other sources.

The USC women’s golf team, seeking its first tournament win of the year, extended its lead to four strokes after two days of play in the 2012 Allstate Sugar Bowl Intercollegiate Golf Championship.
The tournament, held at the English Turn Golf and Country Club in New Orleans, is hosted by Tulane University and features 15 teams, including Pac-12 rivals Oregon and Colorado. The Women of Troy are the defending champions of the event, having won by four strokes over top-seeded Alabama in 2011.

The Women of Troy have received strong performances from senior Lisa McCloskey and freshman Doris Chen, both of whom are in the running for the individual lead. McCloskey is currently second at 2-under 142, striking 1-under 71 in each round, while Chen is third at 1-under 143. McCloskey buried three birdies in the first five holes and finished with four overall, while Chen notched three birdies.
Sophomore Sophia Popov overcame a rough start to birdie five of the final 10 holes, coming in tied for 10th at 3-over 147. Senior Inah Park is tied for 43rd at 9-over 153, while sophomore Rachel Morris is tied for 60th at 14-over 158.
The Trojans opened the spring season with a resounding second-place finish at the Northrop Challenge, finishing at 30-over 882, behind only UCLA.The competition, which marked the team’s highest finish this year, also featured a strong performance by Popov, whose fall season was cut short after a wrist injury during the Stanford Intercollegiate Tournament in late October. Popov rebounded to finish second overall at 1-over 214, including an impressive final round in which she notched seven birdies and a score of 4-under 67.
The tournament featured a consistent effort from all golfers. Chen, a highly touted recruit and former U.S. Junior Champion, recorded her best standing, finishing 10th at 8-over 221 to overcome a rough final round. Park recorded her third top 20 finish, coming in tied for 16th at 9-over 222.
McCloskey finished tied for 23rd at 12-over 225 after remaining in top-10 contention the first two days. Morris finished at 18-over 231, tied for 46th. Though rain and gloomy conditions hindered performance and created considerable struggle on the final day, the Women of Troy maintained their second place standing from the previous two rounds, largely because of Popov’s stellar work.
The Women of Troy have been working hard to replicate the success of their 2010-2011 campaign, in which they captured their fifth Top-5 NCAA finish in the last seven seasons. Even more impressive, they won four tournaments, including the 2011 Pac-10 championship and 2011 NCAA West Regional. Victories have been hard to come by, but the Women of Troy are maintaining confidence.
“Our main goal is to win the event as a team and just try to play a solid tournament individually,” said Popov. “We just need to try to keep the momentum going.”
Following the tournament, the Women of Troy will have three weeks off before continuing their season with the Battle at Rancho Bernardo March 18-20.

Our generation has made it clear hundreds of times over that removing that pesky human element from every interaction possible — in the noble name of increased efficiency — is a number one priority.
We approve of technology that enables us to do or watch what we want, when we want — business hours or programming schedules be damned. And though time waits for no man, we demand that TV shows heed our pause buttons and wait for us.
The Internet seems to have heard our call. Earlier this month, Netflix, the company whose model of delivering DVDs straight to customers’ mailboxes put rental giants like Blockbuster on the fast track to bankruptcy, released an eight-episode “season” of Lilyhammer in one big bundle. The show, starring The Sopranos’ Steven Van Zandt as a former Mafioso relocated to Norway through a witness protection program, is a Netflix original series with a decidedly less than original fish-out-of-water premise.
Just one week later, the well-trafficked online video streaming service Hulu debuted the pilot episode of Battleground, a political dramedy shot in the mockumentary format that’s practically inescapable on television today. Unlike Lilyhammer, Battleground — which follows a crew of scrappy campaign staffers working to elect its underdog candidate to one of Wisconsin’s Senate seats — is taking a slightly more traditional approach to distribution, making one new half-hour episode available every Tuesday exclusively on Hulu.
The significance of Netflix’s and Hulu’s maiden ventures into the realm of original programming cannot be overstated. Spokespersons from Netflix, for instance, have made no secret of the fact that, with their subscription-based model, they fancy themselves more akin to HBO or Showtime than to any other Web-based platforms.
Comparing itself to premium cable networks is telling of Netflix’s eventual aspirations. Some are quick to forget that HBO, the reigning king of high-quality original television, began its life as the “Home Box Office.” As Netflix and Hulu would do many years later, HBO initially contented itself with its role as a distributor of content that had previously debuted elsewhere — mostly movies that had enjoyed typical theatrical releases.
But in the late ’90s, the burgeoning network boldly turned a successful business model on its head with an initial foray into original scripted content with now-timeless programs such as Sex and the City and The Sopranos.
The platform might be different, but with the release of Lilyhammer and Battleground, it looks as if Netflix and Hulu are eager to claim their place in the original content market.
In much the same way that DVR technology was initially vilified by the television industry for allowing audiences to fast-forward through advertisements, broadcast networks’ bread and butter, Hulu and Netflix have yet to worm their way into TV executives’ good graces.
As it stands, the video hits racked up by a show’s Hulu audience isn’t factored into the all-important Nielsen ratings that determine the price to air a commercial during a given show, and Netflix has justifiably been accused of cutting into sales of complete season DVDs.
Time and again, young consumers have shown that they’re open to doing things differently than their parents and that mindset almost certainly extends to how they watch their shows. With Netflix and Hulu officially joining the production fray, the line is being blurred between traditional TV series and new Web series.
The implications of Web-based ventures getting into the business of content production extend beyond the financial. Hulu and Netflix also have the capacity to fundamentally alter the way audiences consume a serialized narrative.
Netflix, for instance, has done more than anyone to give rise to the phenomenon of “binge watching” — defined by Los Angeles Times film critic Mary McNamara as “any instance in which more than three episodes of an hour long drama or six episodes of a half-hour comedy are consumed at one sitting.”
By offering up a complete series in one fell swoop, Netflix is merely enabling the decline of our national attention span and stoking the fires of our already out-of-control insistence on instant gratification.
For now, TV networks — broadcast and cable alike — have no real reason to upgrade their Hulu and Netflix threat rating. On the basis of the few episodes that have been made available, Hulu’s Battleground seems to have a lot of charm, but it’s only one episode in. And although Netflix does have a few projects on the horizon — including a remake of the British drama House of Cards and a long-awaited revival of the comedy that got away, Arrested Development — it’s going to be a long time before it gains the critical mass of original content to compete with TV networks.
If traditional networks want to hold on to audiences in the future, they have to understand that viewers will follow great shows and engaging stories — no matter what screen size it leads them to.

The way the general public consumes media is definitely changing especially now that it’s getting easier and easier to get customized content in-home. I think it’s cool that more people are trying to come out with original shows but don’t think Netflix should be too focused on it since their already small streaming library is about to take a hit from the loss of Starz content. I’m just glad I have Blockbuster @Home instead. I was happy to switch from Netflix when my employer, DISH, announced it. They have such a better selection of movies and I’m not worried about contracts being pulled. I think Netflix should focus on growing their customer base by increasing their streaming movie selection and not just on pleasing their existing customers.

Tyga’s time has finally come, and he is showcasing his talents with everything he’s got.
A member of Lil Wayne’s Young Money label, West Coast rapper Tyga has been waiting for a long time to release his second solo album, Careless World: Rise of the Last King. It contrasts with his last solo effort, No Introduction, which was released in 2008 and featured much more pop-dance styled music.
Tyga’s shift to more straightforward rapping was evident after he was featured on Young Money’s compilation album We Are Young Money. Though he shared the stage on songs with label-mates Drake and Nicki Minaj, he was still able to establish himself lyrically.
From there, Tyga worked on perfecting his style, releasing five mixtapes before the release of Careless World to hold his anxious fans over through several album delays.
Tyga sets the story for Careless World during the intro of the title track, mentioning that he “needed to rise and become king.” Tyga raps about growing up in Compton and hoping to survive on a daily basis, then halfway through the song shifts the subject, rapping instead about leaving his city and his girl to fulfill his destiny.
The album’s list of featured rappers and singers is almost as long as the album itself. Young Money leader Lil Wayne is featured on two tracks — the previously leaked “Lay You Down” and the Billboard Hot 100 single “Faded” — and Busta Rhymes combines his usual impossibly fast rhymes with Tyga’s vulgar verses on the appropriately titled song “Potty Mouth.”
Two of the best tracks from Careless World come with help from rising stars as well as a hip-hop veteran: “Let It Show” and “King and Queens.”
“Let It Show,” produced by duo Cool & Dre, has a beat that combines hip-hop drums with old-school R&B strings and guitar, allowing Tyga to demonstrate his ability to rap over many styles of beats. J. Cole delivers a great verse, bringing the song together with Tyga’s verses and chorus as he sings, “While my emotions grow / I still won’t let it show.”
“Kings and Queens” brings in two of the most lyrically talented rappers around: Wale and Nas. Though Tyga delivers one of his best verses on the entire album, with lines such as, “Apologizing for my actions, sometimes I get bored / They say my music knocks, so I hope it open every door,” his guests steal the show.
Wale drops a smooth verse about his ambition being the best and ends the verse by making a seemingly played out Charlie Sheen reference clever. Nas works his trademark style, spitting multiple flows with rhymes scattered throughout and ends the song with the best guest verse on the album.
Listening to the R&B features is truly either hit or miss. The single “Far Away,” featuring Chris Richardson, is the best of Tyga’s attempts to cross over to a mainstream audience. Hearing the incredibly smooth voice of Robin Thicke on “This Is Like”  also creates a vibe that makes it the perfect song to blast through the speakers while cruising down Ocean Avenue.
There are moments, however, that aren’t as impressive. Seeing Chris Brown featured on “For The Fame” led to high expectations and hopes that it would resemble their work on their joint mixtape, Fan of a Fan, but ultimately Tyga sounds out of place over the crossover-R&B beat. The same can be said for “Celebration,” featuring T-Pain; even the minimal use of AutoTune on Tyga sounds uncomfortable and definitely doesn’t make the song feel like a celebration.
With all of these guest features throughout the album, Tyga still manages to make hits on his own. The smash-hit single “Rack City,” originally released on his mixtape Well Done 2, has a simple beat and party lyrics that will have everyone rapping the chorus. But though Tyga sounds the most natural here, he can also occasionally step out of the club setting successfully.
“Do It All” is the best example of this. Rapping about getting his girl back after realizing how much she meant to him when she left him, Tyga sounds just right over the busy drums, putting together a perfect hook as he promises his girl that they are “gon’ do it all.”
Careless World: Rise of the Last King is an album that sees Tyga experimenting with numerous styles of hip-hop. Sometimes, it comes off as being creative, showcasing his versatile talents. Other times, it feels like Tyga is trying to find his musical identity; when a rapper is as diverse as Tyga, this can be a blessing and a curse.
Though lacking at times, Tyga’s lyrical ability stays up to par with most of his guests. With solid production throughout, Careless World should be the launch pad for a blossoming career.

The events leading up to the 84th Academy Awards rivaled the drama of the films The Academy typically recognizes.
For instance, Brett Ratner resigned as producer and Eddie Murphy backed out as host in November; the Kodak Company went bankrupt, so the Kodak Theatre has now become the “your name here” theater; and there’s General Aladeen, “The Dictator” — Sasha Baron Cohen’s latest provocative character who spilled the “ashes” of former North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-Il all over Ryan Seacrest.
Streep Shocker · Meryl Streep’s best actress win for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady surprised many critics who predicted Viola Davis to claim the prize for her role in The Help. Streep has been nominated 17 times and this is her third Oscar win. - Photo courtesy of Bryan Crowe
Nothing could compare to last year’s stale hosts Anne Hathaway and James Franco — a blatant attempt to attract a younger demographic.   Ratner’s replacements Brian Grazer and Don Mischer, however, still needed to reclaim the Oscars’ former glory — cue nine-time host Billy Crystal whose good humor, entertaining musical numbers and experience speaks for itself.
Though the host, glamorous fashion and an extensive telecast go hand in hand with the Academy Awards, the show is ultimately about celebrating film.
Accordingly, rather than producing an elaborate program, The Academy focused on awarding the best of the best: Woody Allen won best original screenplay, Christopher Plummer prevailed as best supporting actor, making him the oldest Oscar recipient at age 82, Octavia Spencer claimed best supporting actress and The Artist took home best picture — no surprises here.
But with these crowd pleasers come the inevitable upsets, and the Academy delivered.
Most notably, many critics predicted Viola Davis to be the frontrunner for best actress because of her wins at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Critics Choice Awards for her role as Aibileen Clark in The Help, yet Meryl Streep claimed the prize for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady.
The actress herself believes her 17 nominations and three Oscar wins will lead to “Streep fatigue,” but can we ever really get sick of her? She is Meryl Streep after all, and her impeccable talent and humble words remind audiences why they fell in love with her in the first place.
“It was just thrilling. It was like I was a kid again,” Streep said, clutching her Oscar in the press interview room. “I mean, it was, I was a kid when I won this, like, 30 years ago.  Two of the nominees were not even conceived.  So, you know, it was great.”
Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall’s best film editing win for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo served as another surprise as it broke traditional Oscar expectations.
“Movies have momentum behind them. There are a few films this year that have that momentum,” Baxter said. “Our movie wasn’t nominated for best picture so it was surprising for us.”
Whether expected or not, the winners and nominees alike have the potential to promote social change and global awareness. This held particularly true with best documentary short winner Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy — the first Pakistani director to take home an Oscar — whose film Saving Face draws attention to the abuse of women.
“I went to college here [in the United States] and worked here, and I chose to go back because people like myself need to go back to create change in Pakistan,” Obaid-Chinoy said.
In contrast, Ashgar Farhadi’s best foreign film A Separation was not made to be a political statement, but instead to tell a human interest story that everyone could relate to. But in effect, the film engenders an unprecedented global discussion that redefines perceptions of Iran.
“[Iranians] are happy, not just because of an important award or a film or a filmmaker, but because at the time their country, Iran, is spoken here through the glorious culture, a rich and ancient culture that has been hidden under the heavy dust of politics,” Farhadi said in his acceptance speech.
Not all of the nominated films, however, strive to create social change, yet they still resonate with audiences through their honest, emotive storytelling.
Alexander Payne, Jim Rash and Nat Faxon did just that when they adapted Kaui Hart Hemmings’ novel The Descendants.  They molded a pre-existing work into one of their own to tell the story of an ordinary dad coping with unimaginable circumstances. The result: a highly esteemed, modern American classic.
“It was more to sort of be able to put that [original novel] away for a second and expand on it and let the scenes and the emotions there carry us through it, and brighten that story,” Rash said.
Like The Descendants, Hugo and The Artist also connect with viewers, but rather than serving as contemporary classics, the two charm audiences as they reminisce on cinema’s past: Hugo tells the tale of the great filmmaker George Melies and The Artist captures the style and wonder of the silent film era.
Hugo’s 11 nominations and five wins, most of which were awarded for behind-the-scenes work such as art direction and cinematography, exemplify the ever-growing popularity of 3-D.
The Artist also took home five awards, including major categories such as best actor and best director.  Though The Artist is not a 3-D film, it shares the common theme of cinematic nostalgia with Hugo, and it is this common thread that leads The Artist producer Thomas Langmann to believe there can be a place for both the old and new.
“As Michel Hazanavicius, the director, said, [silence] is a way of telling the story,” Langmann said.  “It’s an experience and it’s maybe as big as a 3-D experience, even if it’s different.”
Nostalgic or modern, political or social, unexpected or easily predicted, the 84th Academy Awards’ nominees and winners challenged each other, creating a binary that sparked conversation and made this year’s tribute to cinema all the more interesting.

Inside USC’s Bovard Auditorium Thursday, people sat, doubled over in laughter, for almost an hour as The Onion head writer Seth Reiss and features editor Joe Garden discussed their work. During a presentation of the satirical newspaper’s most popular headlines, “Kobe Bryant Mourns Passing of Ball” and “Evangelical Scientists Refute Gravity with New ‘Intelligent Falling’ Theory” were among the crowd’s favorites.
It was the question-and-answer session following the presentation, however, that proved to be the most interesting part of the night. As students and professors approached the microphone to grill Reiss and Garden, a peculiar trend took shape. People were curious about the writers’ thoughts on politics and the news. It was as if they believed that these two satirists could offer genuine journalistic insights into current affairs.
But who’s to say they can’t?
Over the last few years, the popularity of satirical news outlets — namely The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report — has been growing. In fact, these two TV shows are the only late-night programs that have maintained an increase in ratings among people 18-49 years old during the last few years. The Daily Show alone averages a viewership of 2.3 million, according to the May 2011 Nielsen numbers.
With satirical news’ increase in popularity, however, people have begun to ask whether these kind of programs should be considered bona fide news sources. Some people argue that satire has no such value. Its role is to criticize and its only lasting impact is either entertainment or disrespect. What’s more, Jon Stewart himself has denied he is a journalist, asserting that The Daily Show’s only purpose is to create comedy.
Though The Onion seems to mostly serve humor-related purposes, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report are different. Part of a journalist’s duty is to increase the accountability of public figures by holding them responsible for their actions and identifying when they fail to fulfill their duties. These two shows do this regularly.
The Daily Show’s best display was in an episode that aired Dec. 16, 2010. In the episode, Stewart addressed the Republican filibuster of the Zadroga bill, a bill that would provide medical and financial help to 9/11 first-responders. This bill should have been seen as an undisputed attempt to thank our nation’s heroes.
Instead, Stewart pointed out that though Republicans had essentially “turned 9/11 into a catchphrase,” their antipathy to government-sponsored benefits was clouding their judgment and inhibiting the bill’s passage. He went on to comment that CBS, ABC and NBC had not even bothered to bring up the issue.
Even The Onion offers occasionally insightful critique. For example, a recent headline: “Disturbed Beltway Sources Report Congress Eerily Cooperative Today.”
Though satirical news outlets don’t perform all the functions of “real” news sources, they fulfill an essential journalistic duty to truth and accountability, which many traditional broadcast news outlets seem to have forgone.
In today’s fast-paced media world, we are rarely exposed to in-depth, constructive criticism that addresses the hypocrisies and failures of public figures. As a result, people are turning to satire as a replacement, because —whether it intends to or not — it does offer us “real” and useful news.

Former General Electric chief executive Jack Welch said at a Society for Human Resource Management conference: “There’s no such thing as a work-life balance.” Nevertheless, we are constantly trying to find a balance between our professional and personal lives.
Especially during the job-recruiting season, recruiters look for candidates who successfully manage all aspects of healthy, productive living, such as performing well academically while pursuing interesting extracurriculars.
College students need to learn how to balance their work and personal health now, regardless of what future career they choose.
Professions like law, engineering and investment banking are desired by college graduates who want well-paying, stable careers. But most of these jobs are sedentary. Many of them demand long hours in return for the high pay. Many also require significant personal sacrifices to become successful.
While still in college, we need to think about the work-life balance issues related to our future career choices.
Alexandra Michel, assistant professor of management and organization at the USC Marshall School of Business, conducted a 10-year ethnographic study of investment bankers at top-tier banks across the nation. The study, which will be published next month in the next issue of Administrative Science Quarterly, analyzes the relationship between bankers and their physical health over the course of their careers.
The study showed that complimentary convenience services offered by companies, such as free meals and car services, make it possible for all their needs to be met at work. In turn, investment bankers maintain even longer hours, which pose an even larger threat to their physical and mental health.
Michel’s research also found that most of the investment bankers were productive and energetic in the first years of being hired.But by the beginning of year four, the bankers’ bodies could not keep up. Aches, pains, colds and more serious physical ailments started to appear.
By year six of their careers, 60 percent of the study participants remained in an unhealthy physical state.
But the other 40 percent responded positively and became more sensitive to their bodies’ needs. As a result, creativity at work increased.
Michel’s research showed that these individuals were more perceptive as well — they introduced new products and improved the overall culture of the firms.
Michel’s study can be understood as a manifestation of a problem affecting not just investment banking but all careers: sacrificing one’s time and body to commit to long working hours. College students need to think critically about their choice of work environment and how they will handle that environment. Consider alternative career choices if a balance of personal life and work ranks above high pay as a career imperative.
Competitive professions are not only mentally demanding, they also take a considerable toll on one’s body.
It is essential, therefore, to take advantage of the many learning opportunities available to prepare for the coming challenges related to work-life balance.
We can find internships and mentor relationships that help us understand sooner, rather than later, how others successfully find balance in their careers.
We can only learn and better ourselves by observing those who are leaders in organizations, high achievers in the classroom and physically active all at the same time.
As college students, we should be aware of the intricacies of a work-life balance to develop the habits that are equally, if not more, important to the careers that are waiting for us in the future.

Very good article, Emily. Well written and to the point. Recent college graduates often neglect work-life balance and assume they will somehow deal with it later in their career. But as you point out, it is better to address these issues early on and develop effective habits for balancing work life and personal life. Few companies value employees who work themselves into the ground. Indeed, a healthy work-life balance is becoming a requirement for promtion into higher-level management positions.
Emily, what a great article especially as seniors are starting to look for jobs.  
It isn’t the company’s responsibility but a company that shows they care and value their employees will find that employees are more likely to care.  I read an article many years ago in Entrepreneur Magazine in 1994.  It was a Q&A with Hal Rosenbluth when he was CEO of Rosenbluth International.   The premise of the article, based in his book “The Customer Comes Second,” is that the customer has to come second and the employee comes first.  Mr. Rosenbluth calls himself a contrarian.  His philosophy is that if the employees don’t feel cared for or are upset with their company, their interaction with customers, clients and other employees will not be positive which can be counter-productive.  Once you remove the negatives, you have a happier employee who will approach their work with a positive attitude.  
This article and its message resonate with me even today and I have used its message when working with my clients.  In reality, it is up to the individual to find balance; to approach their work with more focus on priorities, plan their day and anticipate obstacles so that they can go home at the end of the day and not necessarily take the job with them.  But an employer, who supports their employees and shows that they really do care, will (in my humble opinion and from what I have witnessed through the years) comes out ahead.  It becomes a matter of finding the right company, with the right fit.
Dear Ms. Weinman:
Thank you for your comments and encouragement. It is always nice to hear from readers. 
The article and book mentioned in your comments sound interesting to read, and they may bring other inspirations to me as well.
Best regards,
Emily Wang

With the Oscars over, the 2011 film year draws to a close. Of course, there are plenty of awesome films that never make the Oscars. Some films are too weird, some too funny and others too satiric, but none should be forgotten. Here are a few redheaded stepchildren of 2011.
Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil
Though a horror satire, Tucker and Dale stands out among titles like Zombieland and the Scary Movie franchise.  The story takes off from the Deliverance vein – creepy hillbillies in an isolated forest. They encounter a group of frisky college students. In this story, however, the hillbillies are the misunderstood heroes. The writing is a fantastic mix of gory comedy and witty snark. Furthermore, the characters are well-drawn and entertaining for more than just their death scenes. Even if the one involving a beehive is a real knee-slapper.
Attack the Block
When aliens attack London, it’s up to a band of juvenile delinquents to protect their homes. Though Attack the Block has a humorous edge, it’s not a pure horror comedy. The main characters – a group of misfits scoundrels – begin the story as disgusting muggers. The film, however, turns them into compelling protagonists. The film looks way better than its paltry budget has any right to, and the writing feels very fresh.
Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol
This film doesn’t need any help, but it’s good enough to recommend again. Regardless if one thinks Tom Cruise is a dork, this Mission Impossible outshines the previous installment in every way except for the villain. The action feels crisp and unique and the pace never flounders. Much kudos is owed to Brad Bird, in his first live-action directorial debut.
Martha Marcy May Marlene
Unless the lighthearted (if gory) romps of the previous recommendations, there is nothing fluffy about Martha Marcy May Marlene.  It’s viciously disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. But like a performance of Titus Andronicus or ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore, it’s equally compelling. A woman tries to resume a normal life after escaping an abusive cult, but her paranoia and trauma wreak havoc on her family. Meanwhile, flashbacks reveal the extent of the cult. Don’t pick it as a date movie, but check it out otherwise.
Jane Eyre
The classic Bronte novel has graced the screen many times but this adaptation is something special. It takes all the creepy undertones of the story – a mousy young woman working in the household of a domineering older man with a dark secret – and parades them onscreen for everyone to see. It’s dark, taut, and sexy without the overtness of other screen versions, but doesn’t slide into a dull play-by-play of the story. Neither does it warp into a bodice-ripper, even though the talent, tension, and chemistry of the cast makes you sometimes wish it would.

The hip-hop community was devastated today with confirmation from Andre 3000 that OutKast has no plans to release a new album in the near future. 3 Stacks told GQ magazine in their interview:
There’s been a lot of talk on the Internet about an OutKast album and I have to say that as of now, there are no plans for another OutKast album. There’s a lot of music on the horizon. I’ve been living off the excitement of new artists…I’ve just really been feeding off of that and this year I think I’m planning to do a solo project. I don’t know when it will come out, but hopefully it’ll come out this year. As far as OutKast, I really don’t know if or when that will happen.
Arguably rap’s most fun to watch rapper/producer, the public has been living without Andre 3000’s eclecticism for some time aside from a handful of features. If you have missed Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Left Foot’s gift for groove as much as I have, enjoy this list of the various projects Andre has been involved with in the meantime.
Prior to its formal release in November of 2011 on Young Jeezy’s TM:103 Hustlerz Ambition, a verse from a song called “I Do” was floating through the Internet. Jeezy and Jay-Z both have a verse on the track, but the real treat is the third verse where Andre kills it.
Andre collaborated with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem fame and Damon Albarn of Gorillaz to produce a track for Converse called “DoYaThing.” Several snippets of the song appeared on the Internet at the beginning of the year but a 13-minute long version has recently been released. The songs first half has Andre proclaiming his greatness to the world in a speedy rap, and the second half features a more introverted Andre rapping over a sedated beat.
Last but not least, Andre has gotten involved with Gillette as something of a spokesman for their facial hair products. He has been featured in commercials alongside Adrien Brody and Gael Garcia Bernal as Gillette’s “Masters of Style.” Not traditionally one to participate in anything that would be considered ‘commercial,’ I’m not quite sure what he was going for with this one, but I’m a fan all the same.
Though the reality of having to wait another few years for another OutKast album is difficult, I am glad to see Andre putting product out there, and we can only imagine that what comes next will be nothing short of spottieottiedopaliscious.

No. 2 USC earned third place in the UC Irvine Invitational over the weekend, claiming three wins and suffering one loss to No. 3 UCLA.
After defeating No. 20 Long Beach State 11-3 and LMU 8-6 on Saturday, the Women of Troy (11-2) fell in the semifinals to No. 3 UCLA 8-7 before bouncing back on Sunday to best No. 4 Cal 9-6 for third place.
Sunday was a tale of two fourth quarters for USC. Against UCLA, the Women of Troy were outscored 3-0 in the final period to lose to UCLA. They held an 8-6 lead over Cal after three periods, and extended their lead by a goal in the fourth.
Senior driver Nadia Dan, junior two-meter Patricia Jancso, junior driver Dominique Sardo, and freshman driver Monica Vavic each scored six goals total to lead USC in the four matches played over the weekend.
Against Long Beach State, Vavic led all scorers with a hat trick. Sophomore Flora Bolonyai and senior Morgan Vickers shared time in the cage in the strong defensive effort, with Bolonyai tallying five saves and Vickers tallying four.
USC had a 4-2 lead over LMU at halftime, but the two Los Angeles schools traded goals in the final two periods to round out at an 8-6 victory for the Women of Troy.
In the semifinals, the Women of Troy took a 7-5 lead into the final period before collapsing, giving up three goals while scoring none to take a heartbreaking 8-7 loss.
USC managed to bounce back from the loss to its crosstown rival by beating fellow rival Cal 9-6 in the third-place game.
Bolonyai started all the matches between the pipes and tallied 27 saves over the four matches while giving up 22 goals.
Ten Women of Troy players scored a total 35 goals in the four matches.
