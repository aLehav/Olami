Construction continued at the USC University Village and Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center facilities over the summer months, bringing transformations to campus and the University Park neighborhood at large. As students return this fall, they will find the Kaufman facilities already completed, with the University Village progressing toward its 2017 completion date.
Both Willy Marsh, USC Village director, and Hilton Hayes, senior project manager for the Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center, said that the structures will make great strides toward improving the campus’ environment. The additions to the University Park Campus are expected to exceed 160,000 square feet, serving a range of needs from dormitories to retail to instructional space.
USC Village, which is expected to be completed in Fall 2017, will feature a total of 2,700 beds above 115,000 square feet of retail space. Retail tenants confirmed thus far include Target, Trader Joe’s, Starbucks and Bank of America. The Village was designed by architectural firm Harley Ellis Devereaux and engineered by Nabih Youssef Associates.
The Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center, designed by architectural firm Pfeiffer Partners, features approximately 54,000 square feet of classroom and studio space with five dance studios throughout and four classrooms located upstairs.
Both Marsh and Hayes stated that the style and architectural influences of their respective projects were the result of decisions by campus executive leadership in order to move the campus styling in a new direction with an emphasis on a new phase of uniformity.
“We have always had a collegiate Roman style,” Marsh said. “[However], the administration wanted to push for something different — a gothic style. The Board [of Trustees] has reviewed the projects, but it is really senior administration who had influence in the design.”
As the largest campus expansion project since the University’s inception, funding for the USC Village totals $700 million, according to Marsh.
“The pro forma with housing and retail should provide a short payoff period and good investment,” Marsh said. “This is not a business opportunity and comes out of a need for housing especially.”
As for the new Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center, Hayes said he was not permitted to discuss financing. However, he said that Glorya Kaufman is a large donor to the School of Dance as a whole.
Both Marsh and Hayes emphasized the power of efficient teamwork and quality team members in bringing the two projects closer to completion.
“Communication created a successful project,” Marsh said. “I put the owner, contractor and architect in the same room in the old Bank of America building. It was very transparent. I really feel our team has done a good job communicating with our end users.”
Hayes said that, when working on the Kaufman building, receiving input from the dance center’s sponsors helped guide the project towards a successful completion.
“We have a really good team, they work well together,” Hayes said. “The Kaufmans have been great; Glorya has been wonderful to work with. Everyone [from the beginning] believed that this building is special.”

Six months after starting her tenure as Executive Director of the Office of Equity and Diversity and USC’s Title IX Coordinator, Gretchen Means is working slowly but steadily to address sexual assault at USC.
In recent years, USC has built up a negative reputation for the frequency of sexual assault on and around campus, which was highlighted in the Association of American Universities’ 2015 campus survey regarding sexual assault. 29.7 percent of female respondents said that they experienced some form of sexual harassment or assault on campus, higher than the average of 23 percent collected from the 150,000 students surveyed at a total of 27 universities nationwide.
USC has been federally investigated before for Title IX violations in 2013, and at the start of the 2016 spring semester, USC faced backlash from students and the public for asking incoming freshmen to answer questions about their sexual histories before class registration.
“I have committed most of my career to this difficult topic, approaching it from all angles,” Means wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan, referring to sexual assault. “This field is very complex, dynamic and challenging.”
Prior to coming to USC, Means served as a sexual assault expert for the U.S. Marine Corps. She worked with law enforcement and prosecutors to investigate sexual assault allegations and process them through the military justice system. She also developed sexual assault training and protocol for the Corps. Means also worked in the District Attorney’s Office in San Diego.
“My years in the public sector — both with the Marine Corps and the District Attorney’s Office in San Diego — have provided a strong foundation to work at USC on compliance and training efforts related to Title IX, the Violence Against Women Act and equal opportunity and affirmative action regulatory requirements,” Means wrote. “The dynamics and concepts of this topic are similar across populations — that goes for the ‘rules’ as well.”
To stop campus sexual assault at USC, the Title IX office is working on increasing the reporting of sexual assault and harassment and expanding bystander education, two areas Means believes need to be improved.
“Safety is a shared responsibility,” Means wrote. “All of us must be fully committed to ensuring that our campuses are safe places.”
Some prevention initiatives are already in place around the University. These include process clarification, resident assistant training, DPS Officer training and Clery Act reporting.
“Educational efforts are under development to better inform students about the adjudication process for sexual misconduct cases,” Means wrote. “Multiple educational tools — online, web-based, and brochures — have been employed, and will continue to be revised, to clarify matters of privacy and anonymity.”
These educational tools, according to Means, include the online consent education program every student is required to complete before registering for classes the first time.
“Resident assistant training has been broadened to include additional modules related to sexual misconduct,” Means wrote. “[The Department of Public Safety] has implemented a checklist for officers responding to cases of sexual misconduct. The checklist is guided by best practices and consultation from experts at the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center.”
As for Clery Act reporting, “DPS added a specially-trained coordinator to enhance the training of Campus Security Authorities in reporting sexual assault and other crimes for USC’s Annual Security Report,” Means wrote.
While many on-campus clubs work on addressing and preventing campus sexual assault, such as Trojans Against Sexual Assault and the Women’s Student Assembly’s Take Back the Night, the Title IX office and Division of Student Affairs have established the USC Sexual Assault Task Force.
“The task force subcommittees presented many thoughtful, innovative recommendations in May,” Means wrote.
Much of the outcome of these committees has made its way into tangible differences.
“I incorporated many of their recommendations into our new policy; for example, prioritizing our commitment to fair process in the policy and adding dissuasion from filing a report as a prohibited behavior,” Means wrote. “Student involvement is essential at moving our campus forward.”
The task force, which includes students, was created “to further discussions with the student community on issues relating to sexual misconduct and sexual assault,” according to the Student Affairs website. It includes five subcommittees.
The first is Intersectionality of Identities, which deals with the range of identities of students, whether cultural, religious, gender, sexual, person with a disability or any other identity and how they fit in the sexual assault discussion.
The second is Rape Myths/Biases, which addresses the various misconceptions surrounding campus sexual assault and the detriment they pose to survivors and bystanders.
The third subcommittee is Clinical/Advocacy, which focuses on augmenting accessible treatment for survivors and advocating for them both on and off campus.
The fourth is the Policy subcommittee, which will examine existing policy regarding campus sexual assault and discuss ways to educate students about the policies in order to ensure compliance.
The last subcommittee is Campus Awareness. This subcommittee works to help raise awareness of the epidemic of sexual assault among students, as well as the effect that it has on the campus atmosphere.
Means’ vision for the future of USC combating sexual assault is a simple one, but it will take time and effort to achieve.
“We want to engender a culture of safety, respect and understanding, as well as a timely response of integrity and justice for all parties,” Means wrote. “We are working with the community in creating a cohesive, systemic prevention plan.”

USC’s child care services provider, Children’s Creative Learning Center, ended its relationship with the University this summer, leaving families at both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses at risk of not having a nearby child care provider.
CCLC Vice President Sharon Lytwynec announced the move in an email to parents, citing divisions between families and the center.
“I’ve learned that a partnership with all families — even when there are disagreements — is critical to the success of any center,” Lytwynec wrote. “Without parents’ trust, we simply cannot provide the type of education, care or healthy environment that children deserve.”
The decision came fewer than three weeks after CCLC employees at the UPC location voted to unionize under the Service  Employees International Union Local 99 group, which represents education workers throughout Southern California. They became the first group of workers under CCLC’s parent company, Kindercare, to unionize.
In a letter to parents, Provost Michael Quick and Senior Vice President for Administration Todd Dickey explained the reasons behind CCLC’s decision.
“CCLC tells us that their decision was due in large part to recent adversarial interactions with some parents at the University Park location that have eroded CCLC’s ability to meet their commitments to USC,” Quick and Dickey wrote. “They feel that there have been unreasonable demands put forward by parents, as well as intimidating behavior directed toward CCLC staff.”
The announcements by USC and CCLC did not elaborate on the specific behavior that prompted the closure of the child care centers. Neither USC nor CCLC responded to requests for comment. However, many parents and teachers feel that the closure was intended to punish unionized workers.
“Parents are angry,” Terry Carter, a spokesperson for SEIU Local 99, wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “They feel that their children are being used as pawns by the company to get back at teachers and even parents for speaking up about critical health, safety and staffing issues.”
Teachers decided to unionize in response to poor working conditions such as low teacher-to-student ratios, unfair treatment and safety hazards, according to Gina Sandoval, a teacher at the center. At the child care center, which provides for children as young as six weeks old, parents found maggots in a trash can and earlier this month, the center was broken into because it had no security system.
When teachers informed CCLC’s parent company Kindercare of their decision to unionize, administrators initially seemed responsive to teachers’ concerns. However, they remained resistant to the proposed union and hired “union-avoidance” firm Cruz and Associates to persuade teachers not to unionize, according to Carter.
Despite those efforts, teachers successfully voted to unionize in late May with the support of many parents, who shared teachers’ concerns about the state of the center, and had previously sent a letter of no confidence to CCLC administrators.
“It’s really important to me because of how wonderful the teachers are at USC daycare, how hard they have worked across the board, that their rights as workers and their rights to unionize should be respected and upheld by employers and people who have contracts that pertain to those workers,” said Joshua Goldstein, a UPC parent.
Sandoval, who led the unionization effort, believes that Kindercare made an example out of the center to avoid similar union efforts at its other child care centers. She recalled a teacher from another district who had said in a union meeting that other Kindercare centers were facing similar struggles, which made her think the UPC unionization could be the start of a national movement.
“If I was working in another Kindercare center and I heard about this center being unionized, and there were bad things happening in my center, I would gather up my teachers and say, ‘If they can do it, we can do it too,’” Sandoval said. “It’s pretty scary for Kindercare to hear that.”
The UPC and HSC child care centers are currently still open, as Kindercare has not yet announced when it will officially cease its operations at USC. In the interim, families are left unsure of whether they will need to seek outside child care services, and the center’s 31 teachers do not know yet if they will need to look for new jobs.
“Employees are also feeling very discouraged,” Carter wrote. “They risked standing up to the boss to bring urgently necessary improvements for the kids and families. They have said repeatedly that their struggle to form a union was never about making more money. It was about having a voice.”
USC has begun the process of searching for a new child care provider to minimize the repercussions for families. Teachers and parents remain optimistic that the new operator will allow teachers to continue working at the center, and that the change will present new possibilities for USC.
“I would love to see USC take a big stand — use the awesome research it has at its fingertips to create a model early childhood education center that removes financial barriers to early childhood education and allows all of our children an awesome learning environment,” UPC parent Johanna Maska wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “USC has an opportunity here — and I’d love to see them take it.”

Last year, in step with nation-wide movements against discrimination on college campuses, several USC student leaders authored a series of recommendations to elevate the campus environment. This document, introduced in October 2015, became known as the Campus Climate Resolution.
As of Fall 2016, some of the students closely involved with the resolution believe that the school administration is not taking their concerns seriously, despite demonstrated interest from certain portions of the student body.
The measure demanded a slew of policy changes; an inclusive curriculum, established pathways to reporting discrimination, more transparency in hiring and admission practices, implementing mandatory diversity and cultural competency trainings for faculty and hiring a vice president and vice deans of diversity, equity and inclusion for each school to ensure full completion of the directives.
Alex Kanegawa, a senior majoring in policy planning and development who helped form the Campus Climate Coalition, spoke of the need for a socially conscious administration, describing the racially mired history of USC.
“USC wasn’t meant for the black folks who lived in South L.A. when the school first laid down its roots,” Kanegawa said. “It wasn’t meant for Jewish folks who were expressly denied admission for decades. It wasn’t meant for Asian and Asian American students barred by restrictive housing covenants.”
The Campus Climate movement gained traction following student-organized rallies in support of students of color at University of Missouri, who were facing racial tensions and death threats. Also spurring the resolution was a racist incident involving former Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath. Last September, while Sampath was walking past a fraternity house, someone hurled a drink at her and her friends, while shouting the racial slur, “You Indian piece of sh-t.”
Sampath described the incident in a Facebook post, which went viral within days. “Some people don’t believe racism like this can happen on our campus,” she wrote. The incident received national attention from the press, such as The Washington Post, NBC, ABC and other outlets.
The initiative pioneered by Sampath and other student leaders initially ran into resistance when introduced to the USG Senate. Some senators questioned the need for inclusive measures, others refused expenditure estimates; specifically Sen. Giuseppe Robalino disapproved of the $100 million fund set aside for scholarship.
“I had the opportunity to meet my donor of my scholarship,” Robalino said in a November 2015 Senate meeting, “I shared with him the particular provision in this resolution regarding the $100 million. His response was the number was not an appropriate number and that it was too high, and this is someone who is donating millions of dollars to USC.”
After student protests, senate in-fighting and lengthy delays, the resolution was voted through. But despite passing through Senate, the USC administration is not constitutionally bound to adopt any of the recommended measures. This is where the Campus Climate Coalition has run into its second hurdle, as the Coalition believes that university administrators are being slow to enact the directives.
Provost Michael Quick created a task force, consisting of three undergraduate students, two graduate students, three faculty members, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni. The University also established a monthly diversity forum for students to voice their experiences.
Yet, the administration did not go through with requests to establish a specific $100 million fund for scholarships. Most recently, a controversial survey was sent to select members of the student body asking about the necessity of the diversity resolution. Kanegawa criticized the wording behind the survey.
“The language of the survey is deceptive and misleading, and the data can very easily be construed to demonstrate that there are no problems the University needs to address,” Kanegawa said. The survey can essentially tell USC that it’s doing a ‘good enough’ job.”
He also spoke of the need for continued support from the student body beyond showing up to protests and widely-publicized events. For Kanegawa, the momentum of the resolution is preserved by consistent student involvement.
“There’s a lot of involvement that we just need to figure out how to tap,” Kanegawa said. “We need to figure out how to sustain long-term involvement, which means not just coming in for protests, but attending meetings, having difficult conversations and breaking the USC bubble.”
Hey, money grows on trees, right?
On second thought, maybe Hillary Clinton will give you the dough when she becomes president. She could donate all those $250,000 speaking fees.
On third thought, why don’t you all grow up?

This fall, the Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall will open its doors to students at the Marshall School of Business. Located at the corner of Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard, the new, five-story, 102,000 square-foot building will act as the new center for the school’s business and accounting programs.
The hall will also act as an expansion to the school’s existing facilities such as Popovich Hall, Bridge Hall, Hoffman Hall and the Accounting Building. With various amenities and features, Fertitta Hall will play a major role in redefining the Marshall experience for many students.
“The 50 breakout rooms sitting up to six people each and fully equipped for today’s high-tech devices, came as a result of undergraduates’ desire for more collaborative work spaces,” said Julie Tilsner, a spokesperson for Marshall. “Marshall and Leventhal students do a great deal of their work in teams, and they wanted ample, dedicated space to facilitate this mindset.”
The entirety of the LEED-certified building will exclusively serve the undergraduate population of the school, as it was designed specifically to address the needs of these students. In addition to the breakout rooms, Fertitta Hall will be the home of 20 new classrooms that will seat 1,046 students in total. Among them are two large lecture halls and three state-of-the-art, interactive learning classrooms.
Beyond new classrooms, the building also contains new office spaces for undergraduate programming, a business library located on the first floor, an Asian-themed food court-style cafe and a spacious courtyard connecting the building to Popovich Hall. The fifth floor will serve as the new home for the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, which was ranked No. 3 by U.S. News & World Report as one of the nation’s leading entrepreneurship programs.
Fertitta Hall, which broke ground in September 2014, is now one of the most memorable structures on campus. With a windowed turret facing outward onto University Park, the cathedral-like building was designed by L.A.-based architecture firm AC Martin.
The Marshall building was officially constructed through a generous gift from Jill and Frank Fertitta, who graduated from the University in 1984. A Marshall graduate, Frank Fertitta III has worked to establish three successful businesses — Fertitta Entertainment, a Las Vegas-based casino and resort management company; Station Casinos, a branch of casino networks in Southern Nevada; and Zuffa LLC, which owns the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The family has been reputed as major contributors to President C. L. Max Nikias’ $6 billion fundraising campaign.
Many have praised the University’s efforts to provide more resources and opportunities to students.
“A lot of us feel that the other undergraduate buildings like Hoffman and Bridge Halls are old and outdated,” said Crystil Quiroz, a junior studying business administration. “So with Fertitta Hall, it’s great knowing that there’s going to be new classrooms and facilities that we can use. I’m sure it will help us with our overall learning experiences because there’s more updated technology and resources in the building.”
Fertitta Hall is scheduled to open on Aug. 22 for classes.
Yep it will help us with your overall learning experiences because there’s more updated technology and resources in the building.It’s really advanced Marshall School of Business for success and build advanced feature of students I appreciate with your all subscription.I hope it’s expensive and all Latest technology resources

The Roski School of Art and Design has recently made changes to its Master’s of Fine Arts program following widespread criticism of the curriculum and the appointment of Erica Muhl as Dean.
Over the summer, Muhl welcomed five new faculty members in a hiring decision that was described as “transformative” on the Roski website.
However, despite these changes, problems persist that have affected Roski’s overall ranking on both a University-wide and a nationwide scale.
In May 2015, all seven students of Roski’s MFA class of 2016 withdrew, protesting curriculum and funding changes, loss of faculty and the appointment of Muhl, whom the former students believed was unqualified to head the art school.
These students created a Tumblr, “MFA NO MFA,” where they posted a letter addressed to Muhl, Provost Michael Quick, the Office of the Registrar and President C. L. Max Nikias.
In the letter, they accused the administration of luring them into the program with promises of teaching assistant positions and scholarships that would cover 82 percent of their tuition. However, when the University attempted to renegotiate these terms in Spring 2015, the former MFA students were left with only 65 percent of their tuition covered and a large amount of debt, according to their letter.
In response to the students’ complaints, Muhl issued a statement expressing her regret over the students’ collective withdrawal and her faith in the Roski MFA program, which she claimed was “one of the most generously funded programs in the country.”
Shortly after, several current and former faculty members of the Roski School issued a statement in support of the seven former students.
“For years, the University has been following a nationwide trend, shifting resources and focus away from the execution of our core educational mission and towards bloated administrative salaries, lavish infrastructure projects and a business model of education,” the statement said.
As a result of the controversy, Roski enrolled only one MFA student the following year, HaeAhn Kwon, who also withdrew from the University after one year despite having her tuition and other expenses fully covered via a fellowship.
Kwon said that she decided to leave because of the program’s lack of structure, according to a letter to Quick.
“I had no functioning ‘Group Critique’ class, the central component of an MFA degree, for which I was registered to meet twice a week for three hours each session,” Kwon wrote in the letter. “Instead, there was a single one-and-a-half-hour session in November, hastily put together with a first-year [Master of Arts] student with a [Bachelor of Fine Arts] background, and one of the new faculty members.”
Kwon also said that the fall term lacked the studio component of the program, with no midterm, no finals and no any review of her studio practice, which she called “the essential purpose of an MFA degree in visual art.”
In response, Associate Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Robin Romans wrote that Roski offered Kwon numerous opportunities to succeed throughout the year and suggested that she did not take full advantage of these.
“During her time in the fellowship program, [Kwon] requested numerous accommodations to offset the lack of MFA colleagues, including a request for double studio space, all of which were granted,” Romans said in the statement. “Her spring group critique included two graduate artists, award-winning senior artists and a trio of exceptional faculty in Nao Bustamente, Edgar Arceneaux and Tala Madani. In addition, we have an extensive list of other faculty and visiting artists with whom she also worked.”
That spring, Roski’s U.S. News & World Report ranking for the MFA program dropped from No. 36 (in 2012) to No. 69.
For John Gordon, who served as Roski’s dean from 1981 until 1987, this drop in ranking reflects a regression to a past in which USC was regarded as a second-tier institution.
“Dean Muhl, while fully qualified to act as an academic leader and expert in her field of music composition, is not qualified to lead or otherwise chart the future of the Roski School,” Gordon wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “The University’s senior leadership certainly has the right to retrench to the mediocrity of its past, but those of us who worked so hard to build USC’s Art and Design programs are deeply saddened by the current path that President Nikias and Provost Quick have chosen to follow.”
Nevertheless, Vice Dean of Art Nao Bustamante is confident in Muhl’s abilities and the trajectory of the art school.
“I have every confidence in Dean Muhl’s ability to lead the Roski School of Art and Design into the future,” Bustamante said. “I’m looking forward to embarking on a new path with our students, faculty and staff to create a compelling learning environment where experimentation is the norm, and the production of art is linked to original research.”
Amrin Khurana, a sophomore majoring in art, said that while she is skeptical of Muhl’s qualifications, she shares Bustamante’s faith in the program.
“Roski provides students with direct access to high caliber job and internship opportunities,” Khurana said. “There is also a lot of liberty in choosing your classes, which essentially allows you to craft your own education.”
Ultimately, Khurana said that she is optimistic about potential curriculum changes that may occur in the future.
“There is an effort being made by the art school to hear students’ concerns,” Khurana said. “I don’t know whether changes are going to be made, but I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.”
I effort being made by the art school whether changes are going to be made, but you guess you’ll just have to wait and see.” What will happened in future taken after changes your art teacher decision. Don’t think about what will happened I have just a simple answer ..You do good then you will get good

The Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine is an innovative collaboration that will bring together both interdisciplinary research and holistic practices with the goal of studying cancer, while treating and preventing it. The institute was made possible through a gift from 2016 USC Commencement Speaker and Oracle Foundation founder Larry Ellison. The institute already has a team in place with David B. Agus, a medicine and engineering professor at USC, taking the lead.
Chief Operating Officer Lisa Flashner explained that the institute will be unique because of its interdisciplinary approach. Flashner described an open environment which will foster a creative community where everyone is involved in the medical process, including the patients.
“It’s not only about biological sciences but also a convergence and unity of all sciences,” Flashner said. “Everything from sort of the typical areas like technology, mathematics and engineering, but also art and food and really being an open environment to bring these disciplines together.”
Agus, who is also the director of USC’s Norris Westside Cancer Center and the Center of Applied Molecular Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, believes in using communication to advance medicine.
“We need new ways of approaching [cancer] and thinking about it.” Agus said.
Agus described his think tank, where experts from a range of fields will contribute toward cancer research, as one of the facets of the institute he is most excited about.
“The greatest thinkers in [fields such as] math and physics are going to come and we are going to present problems that we have in cancer. We are going to talk about different ways to approach it,” Agus said. “Every discipline thinks differently and when you put them all together that seems to do something magical.”
Agus described his method as “vertical integration,” or when one organization handles research stages that would usually require several different entities to complete. He believes that this interdisciplinary model may change research methods across the medical spectrum, and his approach will apply to other diseases.
“I hope that these ‘verticals’ can be created for cancer all over the country and then for heart disease, for rheumatoid arthritis and for all diseases. I think it’s a new way of making researchers, thinkers, patients and doctors work together,” Agus said.
In line with Agus’ philosophy, the institute will focus on both cancer treatment and prevention, with efforts and programs designed for whole-body wellness. Combined with an artistically designed space and proper food and nutrition, the institute will aim to create a welcoming environment to foster healing and discovery. The buildings will have pathways where students and patients can look in to watch the research efforts. USC also announced that the institute will house spaces such as gardens, a library and a wellness clinic.
The Ellison Institute will also offer chances for students and the community to engage in educational opportunities. Students will be able to pursue work at the institute, and even the patients will be immersed in the research.
“For me it’s all about experience,” Agus said. “You need to be able to see it, smell it and touch it in order to hopefully understand it and make a difference.”
The institute, Agus said, is making progress toward treating cancer, but its mission is greater than that singular goal.
“My job is not just to treat cancer,” Agus said. “It’s to change how we treat cancer.”

With Psyducks and other water types swimming in Santa Monica Pier, Jigglypuffs on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Geodudes randomly popping up in neighborhoods, there’s no doubt that Los Angeles is a popular breeding ground for all aspiring Pokemon masters. In the popular smartphone app, players go out to the real world to catch virtual Pokemon.
Since its release on July 6, “Pokemon Go” has been one of the most addictive and in-demand games in the world. Whether it’s walking around and helping each other out or participating in friendly competition, the revolutionary game has brought people all over the world together to bond over aimless watching and virtual creature catching.
According to Los Angeles Magazine, the game has programmed Pokemon to appear in areas with high cell phone traffic. This feature makes it easy for players to catch them in places that are more populated.
When one appears, the player throws virtual Poke Balls at it to catch it. The most Pokemon playersone can collect by default so far is 250, but the numbers increase with every upgrade that is purchased using Pokecoins. Users who enjoy the game find that it’s possible to kill two birds with one stone — visit fun and popular spots in Los Angeles as well as visit prime Pokemon breeding grounds.
Areas near the coastline are brimming with water-type Pokemon. With Metro’s new Expo Line extension, students can visit Santa Monica Pier easily. After a day of Pokemon hunting and shopping on the 3rd Street Promenade, Caribbean restaurant Cha Cha Chicken, which boasts delectable enchiladas, is an excellent place to visit for dinner.
Marine Park in Santa Monica has been known to have rare Hitmonlees. More Pokemon are available in the middle of the night, a good time period for creatures that take longer to spawn  to appear.
Echo Park Lake is another breathtaking location to enjoy the city, ride a paddle boat and catch Pokemon. After enjoying the water and the great outdoors, players can go to Square One at the Boathouse for homemade pastries, Intelligentsia coffee and vegan-friendly menu items like French toast with maple cream.
Another great place for Pokemon nests is the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum on Wilshire Boulevard. Doubling as a fossil site and an art museum, visitors will find the exhibits on the Ice Age and the collection of over 3.5 million fossils extremely fascinating. In the Pleistoscene Garden, players will be able to find the adorable and fiery Ponyta as well as other another rare animals.
Pokestops are a feature in the game, located at significant spots of an area such as statues or public buildings. Players stop at these destinations to stock up on free items like Poke Balls and potions. Players can also go to gyms to battle their newly caught friends with other users. Almost every major building at the University is a Pokestop, including Tommy Trojan and the School of Cinematic Arts. Two gyms that are easy to identify are the Felix Chevrolet dealership on the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street, and the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street.
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art are some other destinations to enjoy in Los Angeles alongside the virtual game. After admiring the art on the screen, one can look up and find the spectacular art that these well-known museums have to offer. You might see a Pikachu at the lamp posts at Urban Light, a couple of Pidgeys in the noodles of the Penetrable exhibit or just some hanging around the block.
“Pokemon Go” is not only a great tool for exercise, but also a great way for players to find a community among strangers and Pokemon lovers when hunting . Beyond these benefits, the game truly allows its players to continue exploring new sights on campus and in the greater Los Angeles area all while connecting with their inner child.

Summer may be winding down with the beginning of classes, but with the temperatures remaining high for the next few months, ice cream should be on everyone’s priority list. Luckily, Los Angeles is one of the hottest spots for the coldest treat with the most unique flavors around.
Salt & Straw
Unique flavors · Salt & Straw offers new flavors such as “Black Olive Brittle and Goat Cheese” and “Tomato Water Ojai Olive Oil Sherbert.” – Rebecca Siegel | Daily Trojan
With three locations in Studio City, Larchmont Village and Venice Beach (and a fourth to be added soon in the Arts District), Salt & Straw has clearly dominated the L.A. ice cream scene. Iconic flavors like honey lavender and sea salt with caramel ribbons keep customers coming back for more despite the price tag.
Gelateria Uli
Located in Downtown Los Angeles, Gelateria Uli has 16 flavors on rotation from their 60-plus flavor repertoire. If customers successfully suggest a flavor of ice cream, Gelateria will give you a free pint. Be sure to be creative, as they are known for their bizarre flavors, such as bee pollen, pear sorbet and yellow corn.
McConnell’s

Though McConnell’s opened in Santa Barbara in 1949, they have become a DTLA staple in Grand Central Market. McConnell’s prides itself on using organic and local ingredients, while staying true to the old-fashioned method of ice cream making. Their flavors are nostalgic reminders of being with grandma — cardamon & gingersnaps, chocolate covered Strawberries and sweet cream.
Scoops (East Hollywood)
The enigmatic Scoops ice cream keeps its customers in the dark with regard to ice cream flavors. Every day, they tweet out what flavors will be available that day, and if chocolate or vanilla isn’t one of them, they don’t care! They serve strange combinations of flavors such as non-dairy maple Oreo and banana toffee.
Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams
Located in Los Feliz by Griffith Park, Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams gives Los Angeles-only ice cream shops competition. There are eight Jeni’s in the U.S. — seven of which are in different states (the founding state, Ohio, is graced with two). Jeni’s offers ice creams, buttermilk sorbets, and ice cream sandwiches in traditional and ultra-hip flavors.
Coolhaus

Hailing themselves as architects of ice cream in Culver City, Coolhaus specializes in ice cream and cookies, with the two often mixed together. Coolhaus makes odd combinations like french fries and vanilla ice cream in the “Fast Food” ice cream or Doritos-infused “Netflix” ice cream.
Milk

With locations in Silver Lake and Fairfax, this place is famous for their macaron ice cream. The Grasshopper Macaron Sandwich is a popular choice. It contains mint chocolate chip ice cream between two macaron cookie shells dipped in dark chocolate. The macaron cookie shell is perfectly crispy on the outside yet decadently chewy on the inside and perfectly complimented by their ice cream on the thick inner layer. They also coat the sandwiches with mouthwatering toppings.
Creamistry
By using liquid nitrogen, the ice cream from Creamistry has a more airy melt in your mouth texture. The strawberry ice cream is a crowd favorite. Visitors can request for the ice cream to be made with premium milk, almond milk, coconut milk or low-fat milk.
CREAM
Hard to choose one · CREAM (Cookies Rule Everything Around Me) offers a wide selection of ice cream flavors including french vanilla, chocoholic, butter pecan and strawberry cheesecake. – Photo courtesy of CREAM
Located near campus on Figuerora Street, this place is similar to Diddy Riese for having ice cream sandwiches with cookies. The blueberry cheesecake with white macadamia cookie is a must-try and all the warm cookies paired with the cold melting ice cream makes for an amazing taste. The salted caramel ice cream is also a great choice for first-timers.

In the past couple years, Exposition Park has become somewhat of a music festival hotspot, hosting big name events such as Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival and Air + Style. Its most popular event, FYF Fest, now in its 13th year, draws crowds dedicated to all genres from music, a step away from the music festival’s original focus on punk and alternative music. This year’s lineup features impressive names and promises attendees even more spectacular performances from some of the industry’s best artists across the board.
In March, the music festival announced the artists set to take its five stages. A two-day event taking place on Aug. 27 and 28, the festival’s first day includes esteemed performers such as synth pop singer Grimes, electronic band Hot Chip and indie rock band Peter Bjorn and John. But as with any other music festival, FYF presents opportunities to discover relatively unknown acts. This year, Australian rock band Jagwar Ma and singer Alex G join other music veterans at FYF.
These stalwarts of the stage and day one’s main attractions consist of rapper Kendrick Lamar and psychedelic rock band Tame Impala. Lamar would create an excellent show with 2015’s To Pimp a Butterfly and its quiet antithesis, this year’s untitled unmastered. Undoubtedly, Tame Impala also guarantees an amazing performance, weaving the audience from “Elephant,” the song that put them on everyone’s radar, to “The Less I Know the Better,” their latest single from Currents.
The caliber of performances continues onto day two, where dream pop band Beach House, a must-see after last year’s Depression Cherry and Thank Your Lucky Stars, and folk rock singer Father John Misty take the stage. They are accompanied by indie rock singer Mac DeMarco, indie rock band Wild Nothing and hip-hop collaboration Banks & Steelz, among others.
Headlining rock band LCD Soundsystem and singer Grace Jones will showcase their beloved hits and potentially give teasers to their new projects. Jones, an R&B icon known for “I’ve Seen That Face Before” and “Walking In The Rain,” has steadily been working on her new album for years now, though its development has been kept under wraps. LCD Soundsystem, who reunited in 2015 after disbanding for four years, is set to release their fourth album later this year, to follow 2010’s triumphant This Is Happening.
However, anyone who has attended FYF in the past will attest to the fact that the music festival is more than just about the music. Colorful installations and sculptures usually line the park, making FYF visually engaging as well as musically. Food vendors at FYF should also excite — last year’s night market, featuring some of the festival’s favorite restaurants in Los Angeles, remained open for attendees until 1 a.m.
FYF Fest may be far from the prestige held by Coachella Music Festival or Lollapalooza. But with the esteemed reputation of its musical acts and overall arrangement, it should not disappoint.
General Admission Weekend passes are on sale now for $219. More information, including a full line-up, can be found online at fyffest.com.

Fertitta Café will welcome customers at one of USC’s newest facilities this fall. Located in the Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall, the cafe will be the latest addition to USC Hospitality’s 26 existing dining establishments at the University Park campus.
In a unique collaboration with the Marshall School of Business, Fertitta Café is among the building’s most anticipated amenities for many students. It will serve as the premier Asian-themed dining venue on campus, offering a wide selection such as dim sum, banh mi and sushi.
“One of the things student wanted that we did not have enough of was Asian food,” said Kris Klinger, the assistant vice president of retail operations at USC Hospitality. “After communicating with Dean [James] Ellis at Marshall, we both agreed that the theme would really cater to our school’s diverse demographic.”
According to Klinger, a fundamental aspect of campus dining is theming and differentiating each venue. Fertitta Café, expected to be a dining hub for many Marshall students, will offer an expansive menu unique from other venues operated by USC Hospitality throughout campus.
In its developmental stage, the chefs at USC Hospitality spent an extensive amount of time researching and were able to curate a menu with many different options for customers.
“We thought about we’d like to offer and what would give our students a broad spectrum of flavors,” Klinger said. “We spent several months partnering with local restaurateurs to help our chefs come up with our recipes.”
The cafe is designed as a food court with six stations that will serve bao, banh mi, dim sum, noodle bowls, salads and made-to-order sushi. USC Hospitality will also partner with local bakery Phoenix Dessert to bring fresh desserts to the venue. In addition, the cafe will sell a variety of Asian snack foods, such as wasabi chips and Pocky sticks.
Across campus, USC Hospitality has offered a limited amount of Asian food on the menus at its cafes. Prior to Fertitta Café, Tutor Hall Café was one of the only venues that had served banh mi and ramen. With the opening of the restaurant in the fall, Fertitta Café will integrate all the elements that have been missing in USC’s campus dining into one place.
The cafe’s space will be able has a seating capacity for approximately 125 people inside the building. Outside of it, benches and tables have been placed in the courtyard that connects Fertitta Hall to Popovich Hall.
Along with the opening of Fertitta Café, USC Hospitality has made efforts to improve students’ dining experiences. Later this fall, Popovich Café will be re-themed to serve Mediterranean food, with specific menu items still being finalized. In addition, menus at Literatea and residential dining have been re-evaluated to address the dietary needs of the USC community.

USC gives students a window to expand their cultural perspectives while further venturing into the artistic scene with its arts and humanities initiative Visions and Voices, which kicks off the school year with its annual SPARK! mixed media show Aug. 18 in Bovard Auditorium, showcasing critically acclaimed musicians, dancers, performers and spoken word artists.
The SPARK! 11th Annual Visions and Voices Multimedia Kickoff begins at 6 p.m. with a pre-show from the DJ dynamic duo Urban Assault, otherwise known as Faust and Shortee, at 5:15 p.m. Specializing in “Dubstep, Drum & Bass, Drumstep and Electro House,” the pair have secured top rankings in the DJ industry.
Wristbands are assigned to guests lined up for check-in outside of Bovard, along with free shirts and bags. USC students are admitted for free. Following the event is a reception and post-show performance by Latin rock-and-roll sensation El Vez. Renowned for his dual cultural representation, the phonetically inventive phenomenon combines the American rock icon Elvis with the Chicano experience.
The Visions and Voices’ Multimedia Kickoff will bring a variety of performing artists around the world to the University. Theatre performer and comedian Kristina Wong uses “humor to make smart social statements about the sometimes subtle, sometimes obvious ways that race plays out in America today,” as seen in her New York Times “Off Color” video series.
Race returns as the focal point of back-to-back poetry slam champion Javon Johnson’s spoken word, who has been featured in HBO’s Def Poetry Jam, BET’s Lyric Café and TVOne’s Verses & Flow. Johnson’s words are complemented by the voice of queer Samoan poet and educator Terisa Siagatonu, whose words speak to self-empowerment and educational opportunities for all students.
School of Cinematic Arts Professor Tara McPherson will be presenting at the event in light of her research on digital humanities, gender, race and writing.
Though the debut event exposes students to inspirational artists who have appeared on national media forums and traveled the world, special guests such as Shannon Lay and members of the Versa-Style Dance Company are Los Angeles natives. From listening to sweetened folk tunes to watching stimulating hip hop, Afro-Cuban and Afro-Latin moves, the city’s melting pot of virtuosos mixes with students who share similar expressive passions.
The Visions and Voices initiative was established in 2006 through President C. L. Max Nikias’ vision. He believed that the initiative “provides an inspiring and provocative experience for all USC students, and challenges them to expand their perspectives,” according to the Visions and Voices official website.

As the fall semester begins, USC’s Welcome Week will be highlighted by its annual Welcome Back Concert. Welcome Week begins with move-in, a pancake breakfast, several involvement fairs and other programs to kick off the new year. The concert is one of several major concerts that USC hosts for students, free of charge for all students. For the Class of 2020, the concert will be its first university-wide event.
The event, organized by USC Program Board’s Concert Committee with assistance from Campus Activities, will be held on Aug. 20 on McCarthy Quad. Along with the concert there will be a carnival, food trucks and other sponsors celebrating the start of the new school year. The Welcome Back Concert expects around 5,000 attendees each year and has hosted several famous musical artists in the past, including Cashmere Cat, Post Malone, KR, Robert Delonge, R3hab and more. Daily Trojan caught up with  Zoe Willis, USC Concerts Committee co-director, to talk about one of the year’s most anticipated events.
DT: What are some of this year’s goals for the Welcome Back Concert?
Zoe Willis: The goal of the Welcome Back Concert is to give students, especially freshmen, an exciting memory to start the school year and the opportunity to build new friendships through an exciting on-campus event. We always aim to bring new, exciting talent to campus in addition to fun activations, sponsors and food.
 
DT: What artists are performing this year?
ZW: I can’t give details but there will be two acts. The reason we can’t announce the lineup far in advance is because it often takes weeks for contracts to be executed on both ends. We legally cannot start promoting the artists until the contracts are fully executed. I can say, however, that the two acts we have are very different from each other but will both create a very fun atmosphere. One of them we’ve been wanting to book for a while now, so we’re excited it’s actually happening.
DT: What time do you recommend students to come and what to bring and not to bring?
ZW: Full, up-to-date details will be posted on the Facebook event. The quad opens at 5:45 p.m. for opportunities to browse our vendors, eat yummy food from our food trucks and explore our lounge. Students should not bring professional cameras, large bags, drones, hoverboards or outside food/beverages, but they should remember to bring their student ID.
DT: What kind of food and beverages will be available at the location?
ZW: Boba Truck, The Grilled Cheese Truck, Los Lobos and one more to be announced soon.
DT: How were the bookings for the artists done?
ZW: We work with our executive board and general committee to compile a list of artists we’re interested in. We have a list of over 300 artists just from last year. We look at things such as when they’re releasing a new project, their tour schedule, popularity on streaming platforms, public profile etc. We then reach out to agents at the various talent agencies we have relationships with and find out how much the artist costs and if they are available the date we need them. From there we have more discussions with our committee, narrow down the list, send an offer and negotiate until we have our artists locked in.
 
DT: How can students get involved with Concerts Committee or other USC student organizations that helped organize this event?
ZW: Concerts Committee always loves new faces. Once school is in session, applications will be posted on our Facebook and website for opportunities getting involved in areas such as hospitality, sponsorships, graphics, experience and more.

While USC boasts some of the best dining halls in the country, many students want to branch away and explore what Los Angeles has to offer. Luckily for students, L.A. has some of the most diverse and delicious food, and one can find anything from tacos to pancakes within a one-mile radius around USC. From breakfast to a late night snack, there’s always something around USC that will not disappoint.
Breakfast
For the days where dining hall eggs are just not enough, there are plenty of options around campus to fuel the day. Jacks N Joes is a popular breakfast spot located conveniently down Figueroa Street just off of Adams Boulevard. The restaurant serves breakfast all day, with menu options like the WTF pancakes, crazy shaped pancakes covered in fruit; 7 Minutes in Heaven, a Hawaiian bread French Toast with Nutella and fruit; and loaded hash browns. Be sure to arrive early because wait times can range from 30 to 40 minutes during brunch hours.
For a quick bite to eat, Armando’s Lunch Truck is a go-to for many students. While the truck has more than just breakfast options, it’s well known for the stunning breakfast burritos that are loaded with eggs, potatoes, cheese, salsa and a choice of meat. Though the truck isn’t always around, it can usually be found on Jefferson Boulevard near McClintock Avenue or Hoover Street.
Brunch
In true L.A. fashion, the University Park area has plenty of restaurants for Sunday brunch. For anyone looking for the strangest, yet tastiest breakfast burrito or some of the best Indian-Mexican fusion food, look no further than 23rd Street Cafe. Top sellers on the menu include the Chicken Tikka Masala Breakfast Burrito, Samosas and the Chicken Tikka Masala Quesadillas, but the menu has a large variety of items including espresso and smoothies.
However, if espresso and smoothies are a must, Nature’s Brew is the destination. Located on Union Street right off of Hoover Street, Nature’s Brew is a cozy spot to grab brunch with a friend and catch up over the best latte or smoothie in town. In addition to that is a stellar brunch menu that includes a Smoked Salmon Omelette, a Tofu Scramble and a freshly made Morning Meat or Veggie Quiche. If it’s fresh and delicious, it’ll definitely be on the menu at Nature’s Brew.
Adjacent to Nature’s Brew is Bacaro LA, which specializes in tapas and small plates. With a cool atmosphere and a modern and innovative menu, Bacaro easily serves up the best food around USC. Brunch plates include Free-Range Egg Pizza, French Toast, Croque Madam and much more. The dinner menu doesn’t disappoint either, with dishes like the delicious mac and cheese with truffle oil, the grilled chicken breast on a crispy risotto cake or the margherita pizza to name a few. Bacaro also has many happy hour specials and deals for three small plates, so indulge away.
Dinner
As the sun starts to set and dinner rolls around the corner, many students leave campus looking for new and exotic dinner options in the area. Luckily there’s Revolutionario: North African Tacos on Jefferson Boulevard, which serves up some of the most interesting and unique tacos in town. Tacos include duck hash tacos, Pozole tagine tacos, made of vegetables, hominy, lamb, beef, chicken and chickpea tagine tacos, with spinach, sweet potatoes. The menu also has burritos, sandwiches and salads.
As with vegan dining options, there are also many delicious restaurants like Azla, located inside Mercado la Paloma east of campus, Azla serves up filling and tasty Ethiopian food. Meals come with rice or injera and selections of entrees or salads, which include Yatakilt, made of curry potatoes, carrots and cabbage, Keysir Salad, featuring marinated beets and quinoa, or Misir, made of red lentils and spicy berbere.
Another great dinner option is Ahipoki Bowl, a new poke bowl shop just south of campus. The restaurant is build-your-own-bowl style, similar to Chipotle, where guests can choose a base of rice, salad or both, a choice of raw or cooked fish, sauce and toppings like cucumbers, seaweed salad and crab. Pro tip: Order the rice and salad because the containers are way bigger, so there’s more of the poke bowl to enjoy.

With the opening game of the 2016 football season against defending champion Alabama less than a month away, the Trojans must prepare for not only their tough season opener, but also the most difficult schedule in the nation. Additionally on the schedule for the Trojans are eight of the 10 Pac-12 teams who made a bowl game last season.
Ranked 17th in the preseason USA TODAY Coaches’ Poll, USC will not have easy games early in the season with three of their first four games coming in road games against Alabama, Stanford and Utah.
The Trojans may put up a solid fight with the Tide as Alabama loses star running back and last year’s Heisman Trophy winner, Derrick Henry. This could put a serious strain on the Tide’s emphasis on a run-the-ball offense, forcing the new quarterback, likely Cooper Bateman or Blake Barnett, to throw the ball.
The key for a USC victory in the opener is to be able to break through the offensive line and put pressure on the quarterback while covering senior Alabama tight end O.J. Howard.
“We want to keep defenses off balance by being balanced offensively,” head coach Clay Helton said. “We believe we have the personnel to run the ball effectively and physically and to be explosive in the passing game. At the end of the day, though, we know that we must be able to run the ball and not turn it over.”
In the weeks to follow, the Trojans can expect tough road games as they play conference rivals No. 7 Stanford and Utah in weeks three and four, respectively. Again, their defense will have to control two primarily running offenses, particularly Stanford with the return of Heisman runner-up and AP Player of the Year junior running back Christian McCaffrey, who is predicted to lead the Cardinal to another strong season.
Midseason, USC faces Arizona State, Colorado and Arizona, with a week eight bye. Arizona’s junior quarterback Anu Solomon, ranked fourth in the school’s passing yards history, will test the Trojans’ receiver and tight end coverage while Colorado continues to improve its pass rush defense.
The final weeks, will continue to be challenging as the Trojans face Cal and No. 23 Oregon at home in weeks nine and 10 respectively before hitting the road to face No. 18 Washington and No. 24 UCLA the next two weeks before finally hosting No. 9 Notre Dame at home for a timeless non-conference matchup.
The Fighting Irish have had the upper hand against the Trojans, having won the most recent matchup 41-31. Notre Dame features two quarterbacks — senior Malik Zaire and junior DeShone Kizer — on the 2016 Maxwell Award Watch List, who combine to become a  deadly duo for passing and rushing yards at quarterback. However, the Irish have lost key offensive players such as wide receiver Will Fuller, cornerback KeiVarae Russell and running back C.J. Posise.
But the Trojans have the advantage over their crosstown rival, leading the series 46-31-7. The main area of concern for the Trojans is the Bruins’ defense. The 2015 season marked a free fall in UCLA’s “Linebacker U” reputation with linebacker Myles Jack out for the majority of the season due to a torn meniscus. Despite the loss, UCLA sees potential in rebuilding their defense this season with returning senior linebacker Jayon Brown, who recorded 69 tackles in the Bruins’ last seven games.
Despite a formidable schedule ahead, Helton and the team are ready to tackle the challenge head on.
“I, along with our coaches and players, understand where the bar is set, and we welcome the high expectations,” Helton said. “Our goal will never change here at USC. We are about winning championships and all of us will work tirelessly toward that goal.”

Two brains are better than one · After leading the men’s water polo program solo for 21 seasons, Jovan Vavic is promoting long-time assistant and former player Marko Pintaric to a co-coaching position. Daily Trojan file photo
The men’s water polo team has consistently been a dominant force in the pool and is now adding a second head coach to their ranks. Marko Pintaric, recently named co-head coach of the men’s water polo program, adds to this intense atmosphere, joining head coach Jovan Vavic by the pool.
During the spring, Pintaric was in full control of the men’s team. While head coach Jovan Vavic would most likely be yelling at the women’s team he also coaches, Pintaric, nicknamed “Pinta” by his players, would be ripping a male athlete, even though they won’t play a game until September. This shows a fundamental aspect of the program: Even during offseason, it is still important for each player to give 100 percent during practice.
“During the offseason, all the guys enjoy Pinta’s style just as much as Jovan’s, and we are all eager to get better and get ready for the upcoming season,” junior James Walters said.
Though Pintaric may yell, he also brings an aura of understanding to each practice, as he has been on the receiving end of all the yelling himself. Before Pintaric was on the coaching staff, he played collegiately for the Trojans in 1997 and 1998. He scored an iconic buzzer beater goal from half the length of the pool to win the 1998 National Championship and was named National Player of the Year. He graduated with a degree in communication and went on to pursue a master’s degree in the same subject.
Pintaric, who hails from Zagreb, Croatia, explained that one of the biggest benefits of playing under Vavic is the connection he has with the international players. Only someone who has been a student athlete at USC can understand the difficulty of the task. Since he has experienced both sides, Pintaric has picked up little shortcuts that can help players succeed  in school and water polo.
“You face adversity being a student athlete at USC,” Pintaric said. “You are competing with the best kids in the world in the classroom and in the pool. You have to not only be eligible, but you’re also working to win a national championship.”
Another perk of playing under Vavic was how much Pintaric learned from him about his coaching philosophy. Pintaric said that Vavic is the most diligent coach he has played for and he has picked up on many of his habits. Vavic is not known to let any pass — let alone practice — slide without scrutiny, and his contagious work ethic was passed along to Pintaric.
“Pinta, as a coach, is very good at ironing out all the kinks, especially the little things that we don’t see,” Walters said. “He helps us see things in new ways, like with shooting, passing and different variations of defense.”
Since Pintaric began coaching in 1999, his specialty has been coaching the goalies, even though he himself never played the position. The first goalie he coached was still a close friend, as they were on the team together the previous year.
“Coaching goalies was completely unknown to me,” Pintaric said. “The position has taught me to look at water polo from a different angle, which has helped my learning curve in any aspect of the game, not just coaching the goalies.”
In this year’s Olympics alone, Pintaric has three goalies who he has previously or currently coached participating, representing the United States, Australia and Brazil. In 2012, he had four who represented the United States and Australia.
Pintaric tells his players that they must have the right combination of willingness to work hard and love for the game. He encourages them to correct their mistakes and to remember their goals. Pintaric is also constantly looking for new ways to improve his players. He finds that watching endless games of water polo and talking to great goalie coaches has helped him find a technique that works for him.
“Their goals are constantly there during training, not just to do well at USC, but to better themselves as humans and to do the best they can,” Pintaric said.
Though Pintaric is now co-head coach, he says that Vavic is still the ultimate coach. The program has a meticulous, efficient formula for how the coaching is delegated and it would be unwise to tinker with it too much. However, Vavic has always asked his assistant coaches questions and been open to their advice.
Between editing film for the team to watch and administrative responsibilities such as recruiting, Pintaric has proved his ability as a coach. Pintaric said that though this title change will not have many tangible effects, it means that Vavic fully trusts him and thinks he is ready to lead the team.
“Being a co-head coach is a very great honor for a prestigious university like USC,” Pintaric said. “My contribution to the team will be more standing time and involvement in the athletics of the game.”
The former Trojan knows where his loyalties lie.
“I will always consider myself a Trojan,” Pintaric added. “I have been here for 18 years as a water polo player, a graduate student, a graduate assistant, an assistant coach and now as co-head coach.”

The accolades keep coming for a women’s lacrosse team still in its infancy but already making an impact on the national stage.
The latest comes with sophomore goaltender earning a spot on the U.S. national lacrosse team, announced Aug. 7, the first Trojan to do so in the program’s four years of existence.
Gussie Johns will be one of five goalies on the 36-player roster to represent the U.S. in 2017. She has backstopped the Women of Troy for the season, earning MPSF All-Conference Second Team honors her freshman year.
Last season, Johns was one of the best goaltenders in the country, leading the nation with her 6.04 goals-against average. In 20 starts, she went 19-0 and was tied for the MPSF lead with 49 ground balls per game. She was the MPSF Defensive Player of the Week twice and a vital contributor to the nation’s top defensive team.
Head coach Lindsey Munday was the captain of Team USA in 2013 — a year when the team clinched a world championship.
“We are so proud of Gussie,” Munday said. “Not only is she an immense talent, but she is an incredible person who embodies the attributes of a Trojan. She puts the team before herself and works incredibly hard both on and off the field. This selection to the national team could not be more well-deserved and is a proud moment for her, our staff and the USC program.”
Also representing USC on the team will be associate head coach Devon Wills, making the team for the ninth time, and assistant coach Alyssa Leonard, who is making her third appearance. Wills already has two championships under her belt, including being named World Player of the Game in 2013.
The team was announced after a three-day tryout at the national team training center in Sparks, Maryland. There were 105 players from around the country selected for the tryout. Seniors Courtney Tarleton, Kelsey Dreyer and Amanda Johansen and junior Michaela Michael were also invited from USC.
Team USA coach Ricky Fried said the field was talented and tough to narrow down.
However, the field will be sliced in half to 18 players by the time actual competition starts for the national team. The team of 36 will train for the Federation of International Lacrosse Women’s World Cup next year in Guildford, England.

Each season, women’s volleyball head coach Mick Haley must fill positions created by the loss of key players, but this year, he’ll face an even greater challenge.
In addition to the loss of the 2015 AVCA Player of the Year and three-time All-American Samantha Bricio, sophomore setter Baylee Johnson will also not return this season due to academic ineligibility.
This unfortunate turn of events leaves the Trojans without their powerful outside hitter and starting setter. Haley brought Johnson in last season to fill the spot left by two graduating players. Now, Haley is forced to find a replacement for Johnson sooner than expected.
“She had an opportunity to try and take care of it, and she didn’t do it,” Haley said. “So now it’s a problem for her that is going to take time. I’m hoping that she’ll sift her way through this and figure out that she wants to be back here, but I haven’t had any indication from Baylee of what she is going to do.”
Last season, Bricio, the senior captain, led the charge with one of the strongest individual performances in USC history, recording one third of the team’s points. However, it was her chemistry with Johnson and  her other teammates that helped the Trojans clinch a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament with an 18-2 conference record.
In the NCAA Tournament, the Trojans breezed through their first three matches, defeating University of San Diego in three sets and both Cleveland State and Creighton in four. However, in the quarterfinals match against Kansas, the Trojans’ weak start resulted in Kansas taking the first two sets. USC’s impressive comeback forced a fifth set, but Kansas held on despite Bricio and Johnson’s combined efforts.
With the loss of the two starters, Haley is concerned that the young team will still be developing when the season begins.
“I think early we will have trouble scoring points, getting our setting to be comfortable with people having to get to know each other quickly,” Haley said.
However, the level of incoming talent is encouraging, and Haley is confident that their eight new players have a great deal to offer.
“I believe that we have some really special players on this team,” Haley said. “I’m excited to see if we really can be as good as our potential will allow us to be.”
Four of the incoming players are freshmen, and each will vie for a starting position. Daley Krage was one of the most highly-coveted recruits in the country. Haley hopes her presence as an opposite will provide strong blocking and hitting from the right side. Fellow freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier is another huge addition, with 496 kills last season and 324 digs the previous year at Xavier College Prep. in Phoenix.
In regards to setter, Haley will have returning senior Alice Pizzasegola and Nikki Leonard, a junior transfer from Gonzaga, to compete for the role.
Haley expects two of the team’s biggest games to be their Pac-12 home opener against UCLA on Sept. 21 and another home game against Washington on Sept. 23. The Bruins and Huskies were the only teams to defeat the Trojans in league play last season.
Despite Johnson’s ineligibility and Bricio’s graduation, Haley has approached the season with a positive and determined attitude. He has led his team to the NCAA Tournament in each of his previous 15 seasons, and has no plans to end that streak in 2016.
His experience and Trojan pride give him added confidence, allowing him to mold his  team into championship contenders.
“We not only expect to qualify, but we expect to go a long way in the tournament and have a chance to win every year,” Haley said. “If we aren’t thinking like that, then we aren’t thinking like Trojans.”

Months after an impressive campaign came to a crushing end against Virginia in the third round of the NSCAA Tournament, the No. 11 women’s soccer team has begun preparing for what promises to be a thrilling season.
The Trojans went 15-6-2 overall last year, including a 9-2 Pac-12 record that earned third-year head coach Keidane McAlpine a contract extension.
Fans at McAlister  Field will see many familiar faces as the team returns 21 players, including nine of 11 starters. Senior midfielder and defender Savannah Levin realizes the benefit of having largely the same personnel.
“It leaves that much more time to focus on soccer and getting right into it,” Levin said.
For McAlpine, the message to his team is simple.
“Remember what got us to the season we had last year: discipline in detail and doing the little things well,” McAlpine said.
Carried by a staunch defense that only allowed 5 goals in conference play, McAlpine hopes the team’s defensive effort can lead the way again.
“That’s still our foundation,” McAlpine said. “That’s still what we’re going to rely on.”
But he also emphasized composure in front of goal as an area the team needs to improve. McAlpine hopes that transfer forwards Alex Anthony from Maryland and Leah Pruitt from San Diego State will provide the finishing touches that the team lacked last season.
Anthony finished tied for second in the Big Ten with 10 goals while Pruitt led her team, also with 10 goals. If the transfers can adjust quickly to the rest of the team and establish a rapport with All-Pac-12 First Team selection and leading scorer Morgan Andrews, a senior midfielder, the team could form a formidable attack.
The Trojans face many teams that played in the postseason last year and will face many who are ranked in the preseason Top-25. In conference, the team hosts Stanford on Oct. 6 and crosstown rival UCLA Nov. 4. But McAlpine and his players are not shying away from the challenge.
“The expectation is always to push to be in the top three in the conference and to get seeded,” McAlpine said. “If you’re seeded in the national tournament you give yourself a chance to make a run.”
Therein lies the benefit of playing difficult out-of-conference games against perennial powers like North Carolina, McAlpine said.
“Non-conference games are about trying to challenge yourself to prepare for conference [games] and playing well and growing every game,” McAlpine said.
McAlpine’s expectations for the upcoming season are simple: make the NCAA tournament and get as far as possible. His players echo his confidence and embrace the opportunity to match up against tough opponents.
“Every game is a difficult game so you don’t take any game lightly, but you get up to play teams like that,” senior defender Kayla Mills said. “We know what we’re capable of so it’s exciting to have them.”
Back in the fold as well is forward Katie Johnson, a redshirt senior who tied for second in scoring for the Trojans in 2014 before being redshirted all of last season as she recovered from injury.
With Johnson’s return — the transfer forwards and the development of young talent Sydney Johnson — a junior this year who tallied 5 goals last season, it seems a competition is brewing at forward. The Trojans can only hope the eventual striker pairing will help transform what was a weakness last year into a strength.
Another key piece will be Mills, who as a senior sees some added responsibility on the team. Coming off an incredible season that earned her Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year and an All-Pac-12 First Team Selection, Mills prefers to focus on team goals.
“I have a lot to work on,” Mills said. “But I feel like it’s part of my job to lead to the team to everything we’re going to do this year.”
As for being placed on the watch list for the MAC Hermann Trophy Award — awarded to both the top male and female collegiate soccer player — along with teammate Morgan Andrews, Mills is thankful to her team for putting her in this position.
“It’s not about me,” Mills said. “If this team is successful, we’re going to get people places where they want to go.”
Levin praised her teammate and emphasizes her selflessness and drive to improve.
“Soccer is always on her mind,” Levin said. “She’s doing everything she can to get better. Not just to get on lists like that. She just loves the game and loves the team and loves her coaches, and I think she’s just a special player.”
Meanwhile, Mills is not short of confidence when she speaks of what this team can achieve.
“Everyone stay tuned,” Mills said.
The Trojans’ season officially begins Aug. 19 when they visit Santa Clara.

The never-ending sports cycle that is USC athletics is back for another fall semester — a period of time that never seems to lack excitement.
Football, of course, takes the cake. You may remember a year ago — not more than a week into the semester — when a horde of news trucks and cameras swarmed the practice field after head coach Steve Sarkisian went rogue at the annual Salute of Troy event.
The scandal followed the team for much of the season, as Sarkisian took a leave of absence and was promptly fired after his problems with alcohol came to light. They lost to Stanford and Washington at home and to Notre Dame on the road (where then-Athletic Director Pat Haden collapsed on the sideline). And yet, a team mired in controversy and negative attention — seemingly bound for a lost season — won five of its final six games and ended up four quarters away from an improbable trip to the Rose Bowl.
But the Trojans were literally run out of Levi’s Stadium by Christian McCaffrey and Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship Game and their season ended with a loss to Wisconsin in the Holiday Bowl, a game that was just as bitter as the cold winter night at Qualcomm Stadium.
Assuming they make it past Salute to Troy on Aug. 19 without incident, the Trojans will already be in better shape than they were last year entering the season. But — unexpected controversy aside — criticism could still be quick to rain down on the No. 17 ranked team in the nation in the preseason coaches’ poll.
There will be a new quarterback — either the redshirt junior Max Browne or unexpected challenger redshirt freshman Sam Darnold — and whomever is chosen will be thrown into the fire quickly. The man who picks him will be Clay Helton, entering his first full season at the helm, feted with a long-term contract and a plate full of expectations to restore USC football to national prominence.
For a rookie head coach with an unproven quarterback, an easy schedule to begin the season would be beneficial — maybe games against Arkansas State or Fresno State. Um, how about facing Alabama, Stanford and Utah in three of their first four games, all away from the Coliseum?
The task ahead is daunting, but it wouldn’t be Trojan football without it. The program is no stranger to adversity in recent years, from the crippling sanctions to the Lane Kiffin era to the Sarkisian fiasco.
This year, it’s a story that could end in any number of ways, and it will be under a new Athletic Director in Lynn Swann. Much like Helton will seek to calm the waters on the sidelines, Swann will look to provide stability at the top after Haden’s up-and-down tenure.
Fair or unfair, athletic directors at USC are ultimately judged by the accomplishments of the football team, but Swann could extend a positive first impression if other fall sports succeed as well.
He has some good cards to play right away. Men’s water polo is a perennial lock to make the NCAA title match, and the legendary Jovan Vavic and new co-head coach Marko Pintaric will be hungry to avenge last season’s championship defeat to UCLA. Women’s volleyball is also a national powerhouse, going 33-3 last season and appearing in the NCAA Regional Championship match for the fifth time in six years. Women’s soccer is a program on the rise. Fresh off a deep postseason run, the Women of Troy will return most of their starters and are projected to finish second in the Pac-12 in the preseason coaches’ poll.
But, like it or not, those three programs could each have unbeaten seasons and it wouldn’t mitigate the backlash that would come with a mediocre football campaign. The buck stops (and starts) with Helton and who he picks to be his quarterback. And when kickoff happens against defending national champion Alabama — as someone once wrote in a book — let the games begin, and may the odds be ever in their favor.

USC finished 2015 with a 8-6 record and a disappointing loss to Wisconsin in the Holiday Bowl. The Trojans begin their 2016 campaign with the hardest schedule in the FBS, and competitions for starting positions all over the field.
The position battles that are garnering the most attention include quarterback, outside linebacker, defensive tackle, wide receiver and cornerback.
Head coach Clay Helton, a proponent of offseason competition, stressed that though there has been much more attention given to the quarterback spot, every position is at stake this fall.
“For a football coach, this is like Christmas,” Helton told  reporters after the first day of camp. “The last three days, I’ve felt like an 8-year-old at the top of the stairs waiting to go down and open his presents.”
Quarterbacks
Despite early confidence in redshirt junior veteran Max Browne, redshirt freshman Sam Darnold has impressed coaches due to his dual-threat capabilities and surprising accuracy.
Browne, the heavy favorite going into camp, brings unique game experience and a superior pocket presence to the table. Behind former quarterback Cody Kessler for two straight seasons,  former Gatorade National Football Player of the Year appeared  in nine games over his career and completed 11-of-19 passes for 143 yards.
In terms of passing ability, Browne offers a slight advantage over Darnold. With a more lean build at 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds, Browne can better utilize his field vision.
Helton still has time to make his decision as to who will start by the end of camp.
“Both are playing at a really high level,” Helton said. “I really want to see both guys and how they function with the first team.”
As it appears from the first days of camp, Darnold impresses with his athleticism and running ability — something which could set him apart from Browne.
Linebacker
With former linebacker Su’a Cravens now playing for the Washington Redskins, the outside linebacker position loses not only an excellent run-stopping force, but an efficient pass disruptor.
Along with Cravens, the Trojans are going to miss Anthony Sarao and backup Lamar Dawson, who combined for 383 career tackles at USC.
In their places will be sophomore Cameron Smith, who won the 2015 Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year last season — despite tearing his ACL in November — along with senior Michael Hutchings, junior Olajuwon Tucker, junior Uchenna Nwosu, senior Quinton Powell, redshirt junior Joel Foy and redshirt sophomores Reuben Peters and converted outside linebacker Grant Moore.
With USC’s hybrid 5-2 defensive scheme, Smith is likely to be a perfect fit as one of the starting linebackers, but the other linebacker position remains a toss-up with Hutchings, Tucker and Nwosu having great experience and talent.
The player that develops the most this camp will likely see starting time come Sept. 3.
“Some guys have played but not too many started,” linebackers coach Johnny Nansen said. “We’re developing guys to be starters.”
Defensive tackle
One of the biggest areas of concern is the defensive line which lost three starters  in nose tackle Antwaun Woods, tackle Delvon Simmons and defensive end Greg Townsend Jr.
A collection of potential replacements are on the roster, including sophomores Rasheem Green, Noah Jefferson, Jacob Daniel, redshirt sophomore Malik Dorton, redshirt freshman Kevin Scott, freshman Liam Jimmons and junior Josh Fatu.
At the defensive end and outside linebacker position, redshirt senior Jabari Ruffin, sophomores Porter Gustin, Osa Masina, redshirt sophomore Don Hill, redshirt freshmen John Houston Jr. and Christian Rector, walk-on Wyatt Vinci and redshirt freshman Matt Bayle — along with recruits Oluwole Betiku and Connor Murphy — will all be
competing for starting time.
Receiver
If there is one certainty other than sophomore Ronald Jones II earning the starting running back spot, it is junior JuJu Smith-Schuster being the number one receiver.
Smith-Schuster, with his physical style of play and underrated closing speed, caught a team-best 89 passes for 1,454 yards and 10 touchdowns to go along with four kickoff returns for 51 yards. Smith-Schuster was in last fall’s national top-20 in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. He also earned All-Pac-12 first team honors.
The Trojans also have a solid supporting cast in senior Darreus Rogers, redshirt junior Steven Mitchell Jr. and junior Adoree’ Jackson, who will see action at wideout in addition to starting at corner and punt returner. Only 16 percent of Jackson’s 981 total plays in 2015 came on offense.
In terms of players coming off the bench, senior De’Quan Hampton, redshirt senior Isaac Whitney, sophomore Deontay Burnett, redshirt sophomore Ajene Harris, and redshirt freshman Josh Imatorbhebhe, freshmen Michael Pittman Jr., Trevon Sidney and Tyler Vaughns, Keyshawn Young, Velus Jones Jr. and Jack Jones could all potentially see playing time in 2016.
“This is probably the most explosive group of wide receivers USC has had since I’ve been here,” Helton said. “With our depth, we now have the ability to put three or four wideouts on the field at the same time, each of whom causes a mismatch for defenders.”
Cornerback
The expected starting corner is sophomore Iman Marshall, who had a team-best three interceptions and nine passes defended last season, and Jackson, who served as a stellar presence at corner last season.
Marshall impressed as a freshman last season with his physical style of play and ability to shut down receivers.
The question lies with corner-receiver-returner combination Jackson, who can still pull the triple threat, but some have pushed for Jackson to stay at receiver and returner.
Among the veterans looking for playing time are junior Jonathan Lockett and sophomore Isaiah Langley.
There are two walk-on cornerbacks with experience in redshirt junior Kevin Carrasco and redshirt sophomore Jalen Jones who will compete with high school standouts Jack Jones and Keyshawn Young.
“I am very excited about the quality of our returning starters in the secondary,” Helton said. “It is important, however, that we develop some depth and versatility here.”

Lynn Swann — a name many lifetime Trojan fans recognize as one of their own and remember from his time in the Cardinal and Gold has returned. This time, though, he is wearing a polo shirt and khakis.
Swann was named USC’s new Athletic Director in April and began his tenure on July 1. The Daily Trojan sat down with him to discuss how his first months on the job has been as well as his visions for the future.
“For any administrator coming onto campus to work, July is a great time to begin,” Swann said. “It gives you time to get used to the campus, and even though I graduated from here, it is a new campus. There are things to learn and people to meet.”
And he has been doing just that. From rekindling old friendships across campus to learning from the veteran staff in the athletic department, Swann isn’t worried about the day-to-day operations. Instead, he is worried about the unexpected issues that are sure to arise and test both he and his staff.
“The challenge comes from the unanticipated,” Swann said. “What decision will a student athlete make that we now have to be concerned about? What new rule will come across that we have to be concerned about? […] Those are things that will keep an Athletic Director up at night.”
After many different careers — professional football player, broadcaster and politician — Swann has learned what it takes to be a leader, and that is what he feels has prepared him the most for his new job. Despite the criticism he has faced for being hired because he is an alumnus (he is the third straight former Trojan football player to land the job), Swann does not see his lack of experience as a disadvantage.
“I’m not worried about the critics; there will always be critics,” Swann said. “Most head coaches have never been head coaches, and as we have seen, being in the system and then becoming a head coach doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be a good coach. Background does not always signal success moving forward.”
Swann’s focus is solely on the student athletes. He has a three-pronged approach to how he ideally wants each Trojan to spend their time representing USC. First and foremost for Swann is for each student athlete to graduate.
“I want to emphasize getting a degree and create enthusiasm about the opportunity and engage the student athlete into getting a degree in the time that he or she is here,” Swann said.
Secondly, he wants to win.
“You don’t get the most out of yourself playing for second-best. You don’t find out what you are capable of if you are playing for participation,” Swann said. “Winning is a mindset that we want to make sure the student athlete takes with them with whatever they do after sport.”
Swann hopes to be the Athletic Director that sees every sport at USC that has not won a national title (there are only five that have not) be the first program in history to win a championship.
Lastly, Swann wants athletes to experience as much of college as they can.
“This may be the most difficult of all with the schedule of a student athlete,” Swann said. “Everything they have to do doesn’t give them as much free time as any other student on campus, and we are going to work hard to create a college experience for those young men and women who are here.”
Swann knows how they feel. He too spent his collegiate days trying to find a balance between the Coliseum and the classroom. This is one thing that Swann feels gives him unique and valuable experience.
Swann graduated in 1974 with a degree in public relations and, as a wide receiver, won the 1972 national championship and two additional Rose Bowls as a Trojan. His quarterback for three seasons was former Athletic Director Pat Haden. Haden and Swann golfed a few times this summer, and Swann said that Haden has expressed his support for Swann in his new role as well as giving him some advice.
As both former football players know, football season is make it or break it at USC, but Swann is confident not only in this years team but another rookie, first-year head coach Clay Helton.
“I think Coach Helton and I are on the same page,” Swann said. “He understands the opportunity that is in front of him, and I have all the confidence in the world in him that he can get that job done; and I will help him as much as I can.”

Going into the 2015 season, it was a given that former quarterback Cody Kessler would be the starter. As a result, backup quarterback Max Browne was forced to patiently wait for another season to get his chance.
It was initially thought that Browne, a former five-star recruit and Gatorade National Football Player of the Year, was going to be the definite starter heading into the 2016 season.
However, head coach Clay Helton decided to give redshirt freshman Sam Darnold a legitimate chance to compete for the starting job. This is not an indication of a lack of confidence in Browne, but rather a testament to the massive improvement that the 19-year-old Darnold has made.
“I feel like I could work on maintaining my mechanics and just keeping in the playbook — mastering the offense as much as I can,” Darnold said when asked what areas he felt needed work.
At Pac-12 Media Day in July, Helton said the fact that Browne is a redshirt junior has no bearing on who ends up starting.
“We are so fortunate at ‘SC to have the young men we have,” Helton said. “One of the things that they understand is when you come to ‘SC, it’s about competition. It doesn’t matter whether you are a junior, whether you’re a freshman — the best player plays.”
Browne has had more time in the current offensive system and has gotten more reps in with the first team during practice. While this gives Browne the slight edge, it does not guarantee the starting position. Darnold has never played a snap for the Trojans, but in his time with the team, Browne has officially only thrown 19 pass attempts.
On the first day of fall camp many felt, including Helton, that the team depth was the best it has been in some time.
“It felt a little like a different team than spring,” Helton said.
Darnold agreed with his coach.
“There’s a different feel obviously [compared to spring ball], because we have Alabama the first game and the season is really close,” Darnold said. “It’s going to be a long season but we are looking forward to it.”
Though many see a battle between two talented quarterbacks as a good problem to have, many  would have preferred a pick after the spring game. However, before the whispers of quarterback instability gain traction, it’s crucial to note that many talented programs have delayed making a choice and had tremendous success. Former examples include Johnny Manziel, named a starter on Aug. 15 at Texas A&M; Marcus Mariota, named a starter on Aug. 24 at Oregon; and Jameis Winston, named a starter on Aug. 23 at Florida State.
During the first fall practice, Helton confirmed he would name a starting quarterback on Aug. 20.
“Today both of them played well,” Helton said. “You didn’t see interceptions out there, and there were some big plays down the field. I look forward to watching the tape over the next practices and see how both progress … Competition is a good thing.”
Despite the seemingly close battle, it appears that Browne will likely be the starter. Even the ambitious Darnold couldn’t help but compliment his competitor.
“Max can run as well. He’s a threat to run the ball,” Darnold said. “He’s worked really hard on that — harder than anyone that I’ve ever known — at getting faster and stronger.”
The athleticism and arm strength of Browne has been stated ad nauseam throughout his tenure. One thing that cannot be overlooked is Browne’s poise as he enters his fourth fall with the program. The team would be hard pressed to find a more patient player as he competes for a starting job. When asked how he felt regarding the Aug. 20 depth chart, Browne agreed with his coach.
“It makes sense,” Browne said. “If I was head coach I’d do the same thing. You talk about that two-week mark, you have a mock week of what a game week is going to be like. Then it’s ’Bama week.”
The two quarterbacks and the rest of the Trojans continue to practice before starting positions are named and the true preparation for the Alabama opener begins.

Summer was mired in events that can only be described as plainly horrific. In all different corners of the world, young people logged onto their social media accounts to find themselves drowning in posts describing events one might hardly believe were real. Facebook helpfully marked friends traveling in Europe as “safe,” like the world had become some Orwellian hell. Millennials of all creeds absentmindedly worried for friends living near cities burdened by tragedy. Another horrific shooting (this time in downtown Orlando) reignited a seemingly nationwide loss of faith in humanity.
Despite the distance in both geography, reasoning and ideology between these events, one result was the same: Young people turned to social media platforms to express their shock, sadness and outrage — and it wasn’t the first time. Social media has become the stage where the collective struggles of the many have manifested into movements and organizations. These groups are able to utilize these platforms to freely and frequently present their social and political needs, desires and demands. From this frenzy of hashtags and movements has emerged something both socially convenient and politically necessary — a true pluralism that, in a time as hyper-partisan as our own, may otherwise have been rendered obsolete.
The movement against police violence was one of the first, and to this day most popular, examples of this phenomenon. Video and photo evidence of manslaughter, mistake and murder alike were released into the endless sea of the internet to be reposted by millions — from traffic camera footage that caught the shooting of Michael Brown to Eric Garner’s choking to Alton Sterling’s death this year. From a wave of horrific images was garnered an outrage that, thanks to the fast and public communication allowed by social media, developed into the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter and evolved subsequently into a physical and ideological movement. Protests in St. Louis, Seattle, Los Angeles and others came to fruition from plans originally conceived and organized online.
In the classic nature of political pluralism, the success of #BlackLivesMatter prompted the development of an opposing movement, billed with the hashtag #AllLivesMatter. Keeping with the theory’s core value of balance between non-governmental groups, the new movement sought to support the interests and reputations of city police, rebuking the notion that racially motivated crime was or is a major national issue. Other viewpoints developed afterward in that same fashion, swirling around the mass message that had originally been disseminated: Unarmed citizens are dying in the streets. People of all races, religions, creeds and political affiliations flocked to the online world to offer an answer as to why.
Though what eventually might manifest as a nasty Twitter fight might not possess significant political importance on the surface, the phenomenon itself belies something quite seminal, and perhaps uplifting, to the American political sea. Without social media platforms, these movements may never have been created at all, much less organized by a steady stream of instant, trackable and reliable communication.
The hyper-partisan era of politics in which our country is currently embroiled would not naturally be given to sympathy for grassroots movements. Perhaps petitioning congressmen and small marches in individual cities and towns may have come to fruition, but whether they would have galvanized the same level of support for the cause — or the same breadth of results (from police body cameras to internal investigations of police departments) is highly doubtful. Whether any of these avenues of traditional appeal to the government would have been organized at all is even more dubious. Social media may not be responsible for the presence or necessity of these movements, but it is certainly responsible for their success.

The use of recreational marijuana has long been a familiar part of college life. Here in California, whether students have a medical marijuana ID or not, the drug is easily accessible and its presence is felt at parties, dorms and apartments.
This November, a measure called Proposition 64 will appear on California ballots, essentially proposing the legalization of recreational marijuana for adults 21 or older (with restrictions on possession and cultivation). The passing of such a measure will have little effect in college, an environment where marijuana can be obtained whether you’re of-age or not. But the fact is, both before and after the recreational use of marijuana is legalized, whether students choose to smoke it is a matter of individual choice. However, the remarkable thing about Proposition 64 isn’t actually the part about legalizing marijuana. The special importance of Proposition 64 lies in the proposed 15 percent sales tax on the drug itself—which doesn’t sound too exciting until you think about just how many people, including and especially university students, smoke weed in California. If the measure passes in November, the state will experience a rapid increase in revenue that can and should be used to address one specific issue: the California housing crisis.
If young people (specifically, teens through 20-somethings) comprise the subgroup that smokes the most marijuana, then the revenue collected from the drug’s sales tax should clearly be directed toward their concerns. In regard to funding, schools certainly come to mind, but also something even more urgent: the state’s current shortage of affordable housing. Across cities in California, the development of new living spaces is just not keeping up with the rising numbers of people who are trying to live here. For students who will have to face this reality in just four years or fewer, the prospect of being able to find an apartment (much less afford one) after graduation is becoming more and more daunting. Obviously, the cost of living here is already immensely high, but as the Los Angeles Times reports, the price of an average home ($459,000) in California is more than twice the national average.
If Proposition 64 passes, California legislators will have something truly remarkable at hand: a sales tax collected from a very specific demographic (young people, particularly college students). If these young people choose to stay after graduation, California will be looking at a steady influx of revenue that has huge potential to improve the prospects of living in this state. It goes without saying that a portion of this revenue should go toward funding college financial aid in an effort to draw more students to the state. But more than half of the marijuana sales tax should be used to address housing, so that these students can afford to stay after they graduate.
The solution to California’s housing crisis is simple — build more housing — but figuring out what that entails is somewhat trickier. Many developers have difficulty building new living spaces in California because of the state’s many legal and environmental regulations. Oftentimes, if the public deems a new project distasteful for any reason, they can and do use environmental excuses to halt development. Thus, building more living units in California is an uneasy catch-22: In order to gain cheaper and more abundant housing, people must also concede to more cramped living conditions as well as look the other way toward possible environmental detriments. It is a tough reality for developers to face, but not one that cannot be strategized. Ideally, this is where the majority of the marijuana sales tax should be funneled. For example, if new units are built close to Metro stops or popular bus routes, the blow to the environment will be considerably less. And if they are built near colleges, where most of the students only stay in one space for a year at a time, there will be fewer efforts to stop the development of new apartments. Conveniently, living spaces located near campuses are also automatically connected to a network of restaurants, stores, and public transportation.
It is time for the public to recognize the deep wound the housing crisis causes, and also to open its mind to the possibility of a more tightly-packed metropolis. It is time, also, for legislators to consider Proposition 64, if passed, as not just a measure that legalizes a drug, but also as a proposal that holds immense potential to help correct issues young people in California face. Proposition 64 won’t change anything about anyone’s college lifestyle. But its impact can and should be felt after college, when recent graduates start trying to contribute their talents to California’s burgeoning industries.
Their state should welcome them.

Fall is arguably the most exciting season for movies, and 2016 is no exception. From thrillers to biopics to dramas, the array of movies presents engaging storylines, supplemented by strong acting. These films should delight audiences and critics alike, a contrast to the splashy blockbusters that failed to impress this summer.
Don’t Breathe — Aug. 26
The horror-thriller Don’t Breathe has been generating a lot of hype this summer, especially for a movie that hasn’t actually been released yet. The film stars Jane Levy (some might remember her from ABC’s Suburgatory) as Rocky, a single mother who wants a better life for her daughter. The blind man, however, traps Rocky and her friends in his house, and begins hunting them. The staggering levels of anticipation for Don’t Breathe’s release could be caused by a few things — for example, the intensity of a super-contained horror film. Though, truthfully, the interest is because of the movie’s trailer, a sublime progression of jump scares that has already spawned a bevy of reaction videos on YouTube.
 
Snowden — Sept.16
The media’s fascination with Edward Snowden probably peaked with the debut of Citizenfour, an Oscar-winning documentary about the notorious NSA whistleblower that was released in 2014. Two years later, Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in Snowden as a man who joined the NSA only to learn that the NSA can see and hear everything civilians do. Snowden makes this information public, but the weight of what he reveals is huge and possibly treasonous. After watching the trailer, it is hard not to imagine anyone else other than Gordon-Levitt as Snowden, as he takes on a truly transformative role.
 
The Magnificent Seven — Sept. 23
The fact that this movie is not related to Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight is severely misleading, but that’s because it’s actually an adaption of two older movies (one by Akira Kurosawa and the other an American Western). Audiences are definitely going to compare the film to The Hateful Eight, which was released just last year. Nevertheless, it might have never been the prerogative of director Antoine Fuqua to create something startlingly original in the first place. His movie does, however, make a real effort at embodying diversity among the seven lead roles. Starring the likes of Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke, the film depicts a group of men who band together for vengeance.
 
The Birth of a Nation — Oct. 7
Telling the story of Nat Turner’s slave rebellion, The Birth of a Nation promises to make its own history in a year where racist rhetoric has come to a head. Recall the infamous 1915 film by D.W. Griffith, also titled The Birth of a Nation, and you’ll see where this is going: The old Birth is now recognized as one of the most destructive and racist portrayals of black people in cinema history. The new Birth responds to this and repurposes what it means to be an American. Directed by and starring Nate Parker, The Birth of a Nation is about to be a national reckoning.
 
American Pastoral — Oct. 28
If you want to talk about great trailers, look no further than the trailer for American Pastoral, which is basically a beautiful, but tragic, short film set entirely to a cover of Gary Jules’ “Mad World.” If you can manage not to associate this song with the creepy Donnie Darko bunny, then you’re looking at a stunningly simple depiction of one family’s descent into instability. The movie stars Ewan McGregor, Jennifer Connelly and Dakota Fanning. Set in bucolic small-town paradise in the second half of the 20th century, American Pastoral details a family struggling with their oldest daughter’s extreme political ideas, ideas that can and do lead to violence.
 
Bleed for This — Nov. 23
Miles Teller always seems to be playing prodigies, and in Bleed for This he is exactly that: Vinny, an overconfident boxer who is gravely injured in a car accident, and must work his way through rehabilitation to box once again. It is easy to dismiss sports movies for their somewhat superficial nature, but Bleed for This, inexplicably, looks like it’ll delve deeper. Part of this has to do with Teller himself, who has become a millennial icon through movies like Whiplash and the upcoming War Dogs. By now, we are already counting on Teller to play the talented-but-brash young man who is good at something but has to work really hard to get better. Soon we’ll find out if Bleed for This is able to create something fresh out of Teller, instead of just capitalizing on what he’s already proven for himself.

As the school year begins, it is easy to reminisce about the end of a groundbreaking era in university affairs, sculpted by the powerhouse tenure of Former Undergraduate Student Body President Rini Sampath. Whether or not you agree or benefit from Sampath’s policies, one thing is for certain: Sampath’s progressivism, outgoing demeanor and sheer resilience have made USC a more inclusive and diverse campus, catering to minorities, advocates of mental health and low-income students alike. With such impressive accomplishments, one might doubt the potential to grow and expand further. Nonetheless, the year begins with new leadership in the form of senior Edwin Saucedo, who undoubtedly  will be a memorable and effective leader of the undergraduate student body. However, his style will not be characterized by the same passion or activist leadership as Sampath’s once was.
Sampath’s time in office led to a variety of changes; she adopted Saucedo’s pet project on creating stipends for low-income students who wished to attain leadership positions and carried it out. She was active in pushing for an increase in mental health awareness. Perhaps most memorably, she championed and co-authored the Campus Climate Resolution, which asked for a $100 million investment in increasing diversity departments, training and the much-needed revival of the diversity requirement, which as of last year was no longer mandatory. Wherever you stand on the spectrum with regards to support of these policies, one thing is undeniable: Sampath’s policies resulted in an increase in student engagement. This year, USG had the highest public attendance rates at senate meetings. As political engagement increased, students took initiative through petitions, protests and op-eds, marking a greater accessibility to USG which will only grow stronger with time. Her results changed the game.
To be sure, Saucedo has all the makings of a good USG President; after all, he did win his election in a landslide victory. But Saucedo acknowledges that he will not attempt to speak for all of our university’s various and diverse communities — as a leader, he wishes to listen to these groups before making policy decisions. Sampath pursued a strategy of activism on issues that counted right out of the gate — Saucedo’s style might prove to be equally as effective, albeit not quite as daring.
To illustrate the point, one can observe Saucedo’s project on stipends for low-income students. Saucedo began the project, and it was later carried out in full by Sampath during her own term. Saucedo did not trailblaze in campus activism, but recognized a core need of the student body. Sampath may have carried it out, but Saucedo proves his ability in one-to-one interaction with the student body, which he feels adds to his projects and work.
Where Saucedo can and will improve will be on the technical side — he picked his Vice President, Austin Dunn, for various reasons including Dunn’s experience in University Affairs. Saucedo wants to utilize Dunn’s time in working on issues such as housing and transportation — continuing Sampath’s work, in a sense. With Sampath, she would come visit your community, identify your needs, put her arm around your shoulder and then use her position as a platform of projection and get what you need. Though Saucedo may not pursue the same style of activist leadership, his calm style of listening and responding combined with his commitment to allowing his platform to change based on need will make him an ideal USG President.

Students from around the world come to USC for a variety of reasons. One of the school’s most alluring draws, perhaps, is the unparalleled strength of the University’s alumni network. On admissions tours, brochures and just about everything in between, USC boasts the depth and passion of the connections shared by its former students.
Despite the University’s stellar networking opportunities, the housing crisis currently plaguing Los Angeles is preventing many local graduates, including Trojans, from remaining in the city to live and work. It is a shame to imagine recent graduates forced out of the home of their alma mater. The crisis becomes even more disheartening when considering that the Trojans of decades past are nestled all around the city in top institutions and organizations.
It is estimated that every year, Los Angeles is more than 100,000 homes behind the needed pace of development. To put that in perspective, 100,000 homes is almost double the number of occupied dwellings in Pasadena. The problem continues to escalate year after year, and action must be taken immediately if Los Angeles wishes to remain one of the world’s most successful and popular cities.
In order to combat such an unfortunate phenomenon, both city and state governments should focus on the creation and passage of legislation designed to reduce the state’s strict housing and construction regulations. These codes include a number of strict stipulations, but the most effective solution is undoubtedly to address those dictating environmental regulation and construction on existing property.
The past decade has been dotted with both local and statewide legislation attempting to address Los Angeles’ lack of housing by tackling environmental regulation, even before the crisis reached record heights this summer. Back in 2013, legislation was introduced that tried to loosen building requirements by reforming CEQA, the California Environmental Quality Act. Under the existing CEQA codes, houses built in California had to adhere to a strict series of “environmentally friendly” directives. By softening the existing building codes, the bill attempted to allow housing to be constructed without the same degree of environmental consideration. However, the bill was quickly shot down due to projected environmental and economic concerns. Though all harmful effects were hypothetical, the potential environmental effects and their impact on the larger Los Angeles community proved detrimental to the bill’s progression.
In addition to the option of amending environmental regulation, there are also a number of bills in circulation that would allow for the construction of smaller units on properties with existing houses (think of a glorified, stand-alone pool house). While non-conventional, these smaller homes would allow for housing without the need to find and purchase lots. In a city that is growing increasingly urban, the ability to build without having to obtain additional land is a prevalent need, and, to many, where the solution lies.
While all viable options suggest some degree of risk, the aforementioned strategies both approach the housing crisis in a logical and reasonable manner. This same method of thought must be used in finding a solution going forward. What will it take for USC students to be able to remain in the city after graduation? The answer lies in a course of action from state and city officials.
California Gov. Jerry Brown and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti have joined the fight against the housing crisis by publicly endorsing relaxed building regulations. Garcetti recently wrote in a letter that “these bills [on reducing regulation] enhance homeowners’ ability to provide needed housing.”
Needless to say, the city’s ballooning housing crisis is an issue that affects both USC students and the population at large. Beyond the fact that graduates can network best in their alma mater’s native city, former Trojans typically have a love and appreciation for the Los Angeles they’ve come to call home. For many students, Los Angeles represents the first time they have lived and worked away from home, and will therefore always have a special place in Trojans’ hearts. It would be a shame to see graduates forced out of the city due to a crisis with many awaiting solutions.
Burdensome environmental protection regulations and land codes have created a quagmire more dangerous than that which they seek to prevent. If Los Angeles is to protect its university graduates, these regulations demand reconsideration. City and state officials must work together to create a plan that allows for the city’s young people to live and work in the city in which they pursued their higher education. The students of Los Angeles’ top universities have much to bring to the table, and they deserve to showcase their abilities in the various firms and institutions of our world-class city.

Football season began Aug. 4, when the Trojans reported for fall camp, beginning the month-long grind before the opening game against the defending champion Alabama Crimson Tide.
At the helm this season will be Clay Helton, who is in his first full season as a head coach. He hopes to serve as the anchor USC has been missing the past few years. Helton served as interim head coach last season, leading the Trojans to a 5-4 record and an appearance in the Pac-12 Championship Game.
Helton, who was previously USC’s offensive coordinator, initially won the confidence of former Athletic Director Pat Haden and the rest of the selection committee with his positive attitude and “no glamour, all gridiron” philosophy.
“I have been impressed with how hard and how inspired our team has played for him, as well as the support they have shown for him,” Haden said last November when he gave Helton the permanent position.
He also brought back the physical, run-heavy attack that put USC on the college football map.
“Growing up, I remember the names — Marcus Allen, Junior Seau, Willie McGinest, Ronnie Lott,” Helton said to CBS Sports. “Blue collar, toughness, physicality. That’s what I hope we get back to.”
With Helton in charge of the team, USC will most likely see a return of Student Body Right, the unstoppable Trojan ground game from the ’60s.
The Helton hire comes following a string of coaches who did not last long with the Trojans. He replaced Steve Sarkisian, who was fired last year a day after taking an indefinite leave of absence during the middle of the season. Helton will be USC’s third coach in the past six years.
Coming off of a relatively quiet offseason, Helton’s first season is still filled with uncertainty as the Trojans have numerous  issues to address, the most prominent of which is replacing former quarterback Cody Kessler, who was drafted in the third round by the Cleveland Browns.
Redshirt junior Max Browne and redshirt freshman Sam Darnold will compete for the starting quarterback job this season. Helton announced that a quarterback will be chosen on Aug. 20.
Another issue that Helton must address is the state of the defensive line, which lost all three starters last year. This season, the defensive line is projected to feature  sophomore Rasheem Green and redshirt sophomore Malik Dorton at defensive end, with sophomore Noah Jefferson anchoring the middle of the line at nose tackle.
Undoubtedly, Helton has tremendous pressure on him from a fan base accustomed to excellence to improve upon last season’s 8-6 record.  USC has recently been named to the AP All-Time 25 ranking as the fifth-best program of all-time and eyes will be on Helton as fans look to see the Trojans come out on top of what will be a very competitive season.

When rumors circulated last year that Greek Recruitment was going to be delayed to the spring semester, all hell broke loose. I remember going to my on-campus job at the Admission Center and hearing the enraged arguments of my co-workers, quarreling like middle schoolers. Postponing rush would be an unfair punishment that would not yield better results, they’d say. But it’s hard to not see the obvious benefits of spring rush — more time for adjusting to life on campus, studying for classes that are undoubtedly harder than those from high school and making friends the old-fashioned way. It is no surprise that fall rush, taking place during a traditionally hectic first week of classes, is a ritual easily euphemized as “a week of hell for a lifetime of friends.”
Typically, this is what attracts potential new members the most: the promise of immediate friends, or even better, brothers and sisters.  Of course, the emptiness that plagues nearly every incoming student can be filled by a variety of activities, opportunities or internships. But what’s a great internship without 100 plus Facebook friends to proudly announce it to? It may as well not even exist. It doesn’t matter that every freshman is experiencing the same sort of loneliness; friends must be found — and fast.
During rush, girls especially are bombarded with tempting pleas such as “Come Home,” “Find Your Family” and “Join the Best Girls at USC” from the day they set foot on campus, thus becoming victim to a largely smoke-and-mirrors marketing scheme during one of their most vulnerable times in their lives. Why not give incoming students at least a semester to decide if they want to respond to those messages? A resident assistant last year in New North, a popular dorm for those looking to join Greek life, had to watch “girls get back from events at 1 a.m. without having eaten dinner, after standing in 100 degree heat in makeup and heels all day, exhausted from all of the socializing in a completely alien environment.” The RA does not identify as “anti-Greek,” but after noticing the toxic environment of fall rush where “people are essentially grouped off from the very start,” she stands in support of Spring Rush.
Several universities have taken this question to heart by deferring rush to the spring semester. Vivian Saxon, a member of a sorority at Vanderbilt University, stated that spring rush “allows you to have time to develop a community outside of Greek life, integrating you into a social scene that isn’t limited to your sorority. A lot of your friends in the fall will join different sororities, so you have friends all over campus in different communities, really negating a lot of the limitations and exclusivity of fall rush.” Saxon introduces the radical idea that Greek life is not everything. Most Greek members at USC would make the same argument, though remain unwilling to compromise on moving rush.
This could be my inner GDI speaking, but the tradition of fall recruitment doesn’t seem to have been established by divine revelation; just because it hasn’t been changed doesn’t mean it shouldn’t. One problem deferred rush could solve is that of the alienation of spring admits. These students already have it tough, jumping into USC five months after everyone else while attempting to assimilate into daily college life. If anyone needs a boost in the social department, it’s them. Deferred rush seems to solve this problem. Some will point out the apparent hypocrisy at suggesting that rushing immediately is bad for fall admits yet good for spring admits. However, a student beginning USC in the spring is in an entirely different situation. They are thrust into an environment that most have spent the last five months tackling. Feeling behind and excluded are common for spring admits. For them, rushing with the fall admits could help shrink the divide that obviously exists.
Unfortunately, benefits to deferred rush are overshadowed by a fear of possible removal from campus. Some Greeks argue that deferring rush to spring is a gateway decision that will inevitably lead to President C.L. Max Nikias’ supposed master plot to abolish Greek life at USC. The fear is not unfounded, yet not tangible enough to resist change of any kind, as Nikias has not made any formal indication of his hatred of Greek life.  In whatever realm, developments should be made if they bring about healthy and positive results, regardless of fantastical potential repercussions.
So far, the biggest reason rush has to take place during the first week of classes is tradition, meaning it would be inconvenient to change. Yet, I would challenge students to think back to their first week of freshman year, remembering the stress, the confusion, the isolation and the frustration, and sift through the reasons why rush and the beginning of classes should go hand-in-hand. While Greek life may be considered an “integral” part of the USC experience by some, there is no declaration saying that “integral” part needs to begin the second a student steps on campus. USC is brimming with talented freshmen who are eager to build their social circle — let’s see what they come up with before their Greek families decide for them.

To my fellow Trojans, new and old alike, I say welcome. Welcome to perhaps the most exciting year yet at both the University of Southern California and the Daily Trojan.
Entering its 136th year, the University is on the brink of great change. Our school now sits just roughly half a billion shy of its $6 billion multi-year fundraising campaign, and the ambitious campus expansion of the University Village is only a year from completion.
It is no surprise then that the “University of Summer Construction” has been in full swing, and students returning might notice a swath of aesthetic differences to their ever-evolving campus. The once-landmark “Finger Fountain” at the intersection of Trousdale and Jefferson no longer stands in salute to our crosstown rival. And at two opposing sides of school, both the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance and the Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall now dot our skyline.
To match the campus’ physical evolution, the student body is changing, too. This year, USC is celebrating its lowest admission rate at 16.5 percent with an increasingly diverse set of backgrounds.
With any great change, however, has come controversy. Many question our University’s rising rates of tuition at a time when the price of going to college has reached an all-time high. And while USC continues to extend into the South L.A. community, the future of the area stands on edge. In our orientation issue, the Daily Trojan hopes to show you how these changes have come to pass and where USC stands to go in the months and years ahead.
That mission, of course, does not stop today. We, too, are looking to the future. For the past 104 years, the Daily Trojan has served tirelessly to provide the best source of campus news to the USC community. This upcoming year will only work to extend that tradition.
It is no secret that the nature of newspapers today has changed radically since the Daily Trojan’s founding. What was done even five years ago must be overhauled. At our newsroom in the Student Union, we understand this and hope to continue to make this paper an essential fixture of campus life.
Look to expect a greater focus on multimedia content and investigative pieces, areas that allow us to both better connect with our audience and also serve journalism’s higher, civil purpose. Our online presence will continue to foster a diverse set of original stories, blogs and graphic elements. While our tangible paper will continue to mark campus newsstands, we understand the importance of meeting our readers where they work best: on their mobile devices. As we work to adapt to the ever-changing media landscape, we want to make sure you, our reader, benefit from it every step of the way.
USC is a special place, and only for a short time do people get to call it home. The Daily Trojan’s goal is to both inform and monitor the comings-and-goings of this University, and we hope that while you are here, you can see that mission come to fruition.

While uncertainty has been in no short supply this election season, we can all be certain of one thing: For the political scientist, it has been captivating to observe. The swirling and rapidly changing attitudes among voters, the ebb and flow of third-party candidate popularity and the accusations and insults lobbed between candidates are all indicators of one unifying trait: No one, it seems, is happy with how things are. Regardless, the primary political slugfest this coming fall will be between Democratic Nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican Nominee  Donald Trump. Trump is entering that fight with an arm tied behind his back, but Clinton’s foundation may not be as concrete as some supporters believe.
Trump’s campaign is currently struggling with a plethora of deficiencies and mistakes. Trump came into the summer with campaign funds in the area of $1.3 million, compared to Clinton’s approximately $42 million. The deficit can largely be attributed to his alienation of many traditional pillars of Republican material and voter support. When Trump makes an unsuccessful personal attack or a political blunder, voters and donors distance themselves from the candidate, or in some cases, flock to the Clinton camp or a third party. One must look no further than the recent Trump feud with the Khan family to find ample evidence.
After some charged back-and-forth between the nominee and the Khan family, who were called to the stage at the Democratic National Convention, Trump’s campaign spokeswoman made the nonsensical claim that President Obama and Clinton were probably responsible for the death of the Khans’ son, Army Captain Humayun Khan, in Iraq. This is, of course, in spite of the fact that when Capt. Khan died in 2004, neither Obama nor Clinton held office in the executive branch or could reasonably be assumed to be responsible for the death of the Army captain in an explosion caused by a suicide-bomber. This absurd statement was only one in a long series of poorly considered and tactless ad hominem attacks. However, the candidate’s vitriol was in this case aimed at a well-respected military family, which resulted in particularly harmful fallout for the Trump campaign: Seth Klarman and Meg Whitman — two major Republican campaign donors — defected to the Clinton camp. Other Republican donors remained reluctant to contribute. President Obama added to Trump’s woes by making the claim that Trump was “unfit to serve as president” and “he keeps on proving it.”
Republicans have more to worry about, however, than just getting Trump under control. They are also anxious to maintain a majority in the Senate this election cycle. But, as history shows, there is a strong correlation between presidential victory and congressional victory. If Trump cannot muster enough support to take the presidency, then it may be that the Republicans will not be able to preserve their eight-senator lead in the upper house of Congress. Some Republican leaders are therefore desperately lobbying established donors on behalf of Trump in hopes that the presidency can still be won by a conservative, however unorthodox and unpredictable that conservative might be. Unfortunately for these Republicans, many big-name donors seem quite averse to the Republican nominee’s positions and demeanor, much like the aforementioned Klarman and Whitman.
Trump’s clearest attempt to bring doubtful party members into his fold came in the form of his VP selection of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, but this may serve as a double-edged sword. Pence, who is well-known as a shrewd and experienced politician who could temper Trump’s inexperience and brashness, is equally well-known for his highly conservative social and fiscal views. These positions, while perhaps calming to a few members of the Republican old guard, may inadvertently repulse more of the 39 percent of voters who identify as independent in the general election, who could instead be drawn to the Libertarian or Green tickets — or even the Democratic ticket.
On the other hand, in recent months the Clinton campaign has seen several boons. The defection of noteworthy donors from the right to the Clinton campaign has the potential to help keep the campaign’s coffers full enough to offer considerable resistance to Trump, especially through advertising, in which the Trump campaign has been notably lacking. Perhaps the most significant advantage that Clinton has recently secured, however, is the endorsement by her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Despite the intense rivalry between the two candidates for the Democratic nomination, Sanders nonetheless took the step toward party unification that the Republican Party is sorely lacking, and encouraged his supporters to vote for Clinton in the upcoming election. Warren Gunnels, a senior Sanders adviser, commented after the endorsement that the Sanders campaign “got 80 percent” of what they wanted to see in the Democratic Party platform. This is a plus for those voters who felt they could not compromise on Sanders’ ideals, and these factors may invite the in-party coordination necessary to reach the target number of 270 Electoral College votes in November.
However, the Democratic Party’s incorporation of the majority of Sanders’ demands into their official policy goals also presents a challenge to Clinton similar to that which Trump faces: the unpredictability of middle-ground voters. It is clear that Clinton is attempting to build a more inclusive coalition than the Trump campaign. What is difficult, though, is getting skeptical Republicans like Whitman and reluctant “Bernie-or-Bust” voters to agree on the Clinton campaign’s relevance to their interests over third-party options that are trying desperately to curry their favor. Clinton must maintain a delicate balance in presentation and policy in order to hold her coalition together in the face of the threat that third-party candidates may represent. Third parties have a long and illustrious history in the United States of not winning elections, but ultimately influencing who did. Reform Party Nominee Ross Perot received 19 percent of the popular vote in the 1992 election, and by Former President George H. W. Bush’s own admission, cost Bush his reelection. The Green Party’s nominee in 2000, Ralph Nader, received less than 3 percent of the popular vote. Yet, Former President George W. Bush’s critical victory in Florida by 537 votes was almost certainly caused by Nader’s presence in the race. Third parties are not to be discounted.
At this point, it cannot be predicted with complete confidence who will win the presidency in November. There are many variables, and this particular election cycle has proven to be among the tensest and features two of the least-liked candidates in decades. However, it is likely that if Trump continues to alienate financial backers and voters with caustic outbursts and tactlessness, he will not be looking at resounding success in November. Likewise, if Clinton cannot prove to young and independent voters that she is their best choice, dissatisfied voters may disproportionately leave her cobbled-together coalition and instead look to third parties. As several recent polls have indicated, given the chance they will have a potentially devastating effect. However it turns out, this November will certainly be one to remember.

Thousands of spectators cheered as Jared Goff, the quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams, scored a touchdown in the end zone of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Aug. 6. It was the Rams’ first open practice at the stadium, following a grueling first week of training camp held at the University of California, Irvine. And for many onlookers, it was their first time seeing the blue and gold uniforms of the former St. Louis Rams practicing on the field alongside the cardinal and gold “’SC” logo.
“Walking down the tunnel for some of these guys for the first time was a cool experience for them, thinking that this is going to be home for a while, so let’s make the most of it, and let’s make it our place to play,” Los Angeles Rams Coach Jeff Fisher told NBC LA at the practice.
The practice marked the Rams’ return to Los Angeles for the first time since 1995, when the team moved to St. Louis with promises of a better stadium as well as an expanding fan base. In the 20 years that have passed since, no NFL teams have played at the Coliseum. With the arrival of the Rams, new changes are expected in both the stadium management and the fan experience at football games. Despite the benefits of increased revenue and attendance, security and traffic concerns will pose a challenge that the University says it will work to address.
The Rams played at the Coliseum between their relocation from Cleveland in 1946 and their move to Anaheim in 1980, but it wasn’t until the franchise found itself in deep financial trouble — and unable to find a stadium willing to renovate to fit the needs of a large NFL team in the Los Angeles Area — that the team moved to St. Louis to start over. Twenty years later, the Rams once again needed a new stadium, and St. Louis was unable to provide the funds to renovate the Edward Jones Dome, which faced a $144 million debt. As a result, the day after the last game of the 2015 season, the Rams — along with the Oakland Raiders and the San Diego Chargers — all requested to relocate to Los Angeles, but it wasn’t until an NFL vote on Jan. 12 that the Rams officially made the switch from Missouri to Southern California.
The proposal for the Rams to come to the Coliseum, however, began much earlier, according to Joe Furin, the general manager of the Coliseum since the University took over management of the stadium in 2014. Furin answered the NFL’s call for any available stadiums in the Los Angeles area on behalf of the Coliseum, and as a result, he was present at talks discussing the Rams’ move from St. Louis as early as August 2015. Furin said that at the time he saw only positive aspects to the shift.
“An NFL team like the Rams would bring [the Coliseum] nine to 10 more events per year,” Furin said. “And with 80,000 people per event, that’s lots of additional revenue for the facility.”
The Coliseum is only the temporary home stadium of the Rams, who will play there through the 2018 season until the new 80,000 seat Inglewood Stadium is completed. But in these three years, because the stadium is owned by the University, whatever revenues the Rams generate for the Coliseum will belong to USC — and although the projected profits depend on factors including attendance and game times, Furin estimated that the Rams will bring several million dollars in every year.
“It’s going to be nothing but a positive impact,” Furin said. “There’s a big economic boom to hosting the event that trickles down to the average person.”
Although these changes are expected to benefit the University financially, the arrival of the Rams introduces issues with traffic, security and conflicts between NFL and NCAA games. Several streets surrounding the Coliseum, including Exposition Boulevard, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Figueroa Street and Flower Street, will be closed for one hour after the completion of home football games — which now will mean not only USC Saturdays, but NFL Sundays.  Furthermore, according to Department of Public Safety Assistant Chief David Carlisle, parking spaces on campus will be restricted due to an influx of NFL season pass holders who will now have permission to park on campus.
“The Rams will definitely have an impact on the University Park Campus,” Carlisle said. “The Rams have bought all of the parking spaces in all of the parking structures on campus for each home Rams game. That means that there will be probably 6,000 cars parked on campus that are filled with fans going to the game, and this can pose a traffic control issue.”
To offset the change, Carlisle said that more than 300 spots on campus will be reserved for students and staff, but that alternate parking should be sought elsewhere by students who need to park on campus over the weekend. Tailgating will also be banned on campus during Rams games, so DPS will face the added challenge of enforcing this policy.
“Those who are used to coming to USC games may think that they can come set up their canopies, barbecues and tailgates on campus for Rams games, but that’s not the case,” Carlisle said. “DPS is going to work with CSC to be here from early in the morning until post-game, and we will be letting people know that there is no tailgating on campus. After the game, the fans will be coming back, and our challenge is to make sure that they get back to their cars safely and off campus.”
Furin said that the Coliseum will collaborate with other bodies such as DPS and the Los Angeles Police Department to manage traffic around Rams games in much the same way as it is managed for USC football games.
“It’s a plan that’s beyond just the Coliseum management of it — it’s a collective effort,” Furin said.
NFL security guidelines will be put in place not only for NFL games, but for all events at the Coliseum in general — meaning that rules such as a strict no-backpacks policy will now be enforced for USC football games as well. Spectators will be able to bring in clear bags only, and security staff at the Coliseum will use metal detecting wands for both USC and NFL games.
“The NFL security policies are more strict than USC home game policies, but USC Athletics and the Coliseum commission are moving more towards the level of security that the NFL has,” Carlisle said. “For example, for USC home games, there will be a bigger perimeter set up around the Coliseum to provide a greater security buffer.”
Furin said that he doesn’t expect conflicts to arise when it comes to the management of the stadium even when — as on two weekends this season — USC plays on a Saturday and the Rams play on the following Sunday. However, according to Furin, balancing the two teams will require extra effort from the Coliseum management staff.
“We provided the NCAA schedule to the NFL and asked them to work around that if possible,” Furin said. “They are aware of that and do what they can to avoid scheduling back-to-back games, but over the course of a season if might be inevitable. It’s just a matter of our team flipping the stadium or turning it over from one event to another, working all night to make sure that it’s clean and ready to go.”
