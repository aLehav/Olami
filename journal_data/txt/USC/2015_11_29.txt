Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
The Trojan faithful came back from a week of family and turkey to witness a truly tremendous sight. Legendary guitarist Slash opened up with the national anthem and the largest crowd of the year at 84,000 was ready to take back the Victory Bell. It really never looked good in baby blue anyway. Coach Clay Helton had the pressure of his job off of his shoulders and he led the USC Trojans with a performance that oozed passion and enthusiasm. The Coliseum was the loudest I have heard it in since the Stanford game three seasons ago. It was less about x’s and o’s and more about heart. The Trojans could not stomach four straight losses to the Bruins of Westwood. They stood up man to man and made plays. All this talk of the elite athletes that USC possessed was thrown out the window. It wasn’t about who was faster or stronger. It was about which team wanted it more. And for the first time in a long time, that team was the USC Trojans.

This past summer, Europe entered what might become known as the most monumental migration crisis in recorded history. As capacity for Syrian and Iraqi refugees in surrounding countries such as Turkey and Lebanon was reached, boatloads of desperate families started to arrive in Greece. Not all boats made it safely across the water. Images such as the now-famous picture of a drowned boy washed ashore shook the world. Greece was not able to handle the growing influx of refugees and sent them onwards into Central and Eastern Europe, from where they hoped to cross borders into the West in search of a new life.
At this time, I hopped on a plane to Los Angeles.
The situation has grown only graver since I left. Terror in the Middle East is escalating, forcing more people to leave their country in search of safety. The United Nations Refugee Agency lacks the resources and manpower to provide adequate shelter and food to all refugees. The Western European countries are regulating the flow of migrants from entering their countries, resulting in the overflow of countries such as Hungary and Serbia. The whole continent is on high terror alert following the ISIS Paris attacks, resulting in distrust towards refugees. On top of all this, winter has started — leaving many refugees out in the freezing cold.
It feels so strange to have been gone from Europe while all this has been going on. All the information I have received comes from news outlets and friends. I have not seen anything with my own eyes.
Many news outlets seem very one-sided. The UNHCR Facebook page only posts about children and elderly women — not an accurate reflection of reality. On the other extreme, several sources claim that the majority of refugees are single men who abandoned their families, most of them not even Syrian — this is also not the reality. Some articles over-dramatize the situation in my home country of the Netherlands and make you believe that the refugee crisis is all that people are talking about right now. Yet,  several of my friends have said they’ve barely noticed a difference in their lives.
There is a lot of discussion going on. Many Dutch citizens welcome refugees with open arms.  My home university’s gym was used as a temporary refugee shelter a few months ago, and I see Facebook posts of friends making care packages for incoming migrants and doing charity work to help them settle in. However, I also know that there are many communities and individuals who distrust the refugees and are scared that they will not integrate, and instead try to impose their culture on us. Since the Paris attacks and the Brussels lockdown, there is also a fear that ISIS terrorists might disguise themselves as refugees to enter the country. Even if this were true, there are still millions of innocent and often highly educated people that want to actively contribute to our community if we allow them to do so.
Maybe my view of reality is distorted by the media. After all, I have not been home to experience the refugee crisis. However, from reading articles and news reports, watching debates aired on Dutch national television and talking to my friends, I think I have enough information to voice an informed opinion.
These refugees need our help. They are regular people like you and I, risking their own and their families’ lives to flee war. I urge my Dutch and American friends alike to tell their governments that they want to help these people or donate to the United Nation Refugee Agency. Give these people a chance to rebuild their lives.

There’s a lot to be thankful for at USC, including our win over UCLA! Flickr/CreativeCommons
As Thanksgiving has just passed us by, this is the perfect time to reflect on everything you’re grateful for in your life. USC offers a lot of amenities and resources that are otherwise unavailable in other institutions, and I appreciate many things in this multiple-faceted establishment. At USC, I am thankful for…
Free Uber
Our school invests a lot money into Uber rides that run from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m., seven days a week, and for good reason. As most students don’t live on campus and don’t necessarily own cars, it is now more convenient to get home safely at night. It is also a good method of transportation after you’ve gone out partying, and walking home late at night isn’t a favorable option.
On Campus Dining Options
USC has made an effort to provide healthier food in our dining halls and other hospitality services. Starting with the dining halls, our school has implemented choices for people with special dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan, etc.). There are also a variety of restaurants and food trucks scattered across campus that serve a diverse range of food. In addition, the farmer’s market every Wednesday in McCarthy Quad has a lot of fresh products, organic produce and delicious stands to choose from.
Libraries
The plethora of libraries makes it easy for students to have a variety of choices of where they want to study. Some even have computer labs and private study rooms. You can personalize your workspace in the library by reserving rooms for group collaborations or find a quiet space to work alone. I personally prefer working in Doheny because of the openness it provides in each room, but there are many libraries that have a different set-up to cater to your work preferences.  
Professors and TAs
My professors and TA’s have been an integral part of my education in that they have inspired me to learn about new subjects and influenced my academic interests. These people are helpful resources and knowledgeable in their respective fields of study. They are also passionate about ensuring their students’ success and teaching the material in ways that engage us.
USC has given me a lot to be grateful for, and I hope that you have as much to be thankful for during your time here.
