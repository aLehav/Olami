In a tournament like March Madness, there are two sides of the coin — the dreamers and the dream crushers.
In sixth-seeded USC’s first Elite Eight appearance since 2001, its Final Four dreams were crushed by the overwhelming first-seeded Gonzaga Bulldogs, who cruised to an 85-66 victory Tuesday night in Indianapolis. The loss marked the first time this season the Trojans have lost after having four players score in double figures. 
Sophomore forward Isaiah Mobley led USC with 19 points and seven rebounds. His brother, freshman forward Evan Mobley, in what was presumably his last college game, added 17 points and five rebounds. Both brothers were named to the 2021 March Madness West Regional Team.  
In their biggest game of the season, the Trojans struggled to get comfortable. They opened the first quarter looking sloppy and out of place on offense with five turnovers early. 
“They got into transition a lot [in the beginning], we didn’t get back enough. We tried to put emphasis on that, but we didn’t get back fast enough,” Evan said in a virtual press conference after the game. “That’s when they got a lot of free buckets, easy layups, and that’s when they went up.”
Before USC fans had a chance to get comfortable on their couch, Gonzaga jumped all over the Trojans by putting together a 17-4 run within the first six minutes of the game. 
The Bulldogs were the more comfortable team: skipping and hopping up and down the court for fast-break layups and 3-pointers.  
Bringing up the ball and setting up the offense became difficult for USC. It seemed like everything from passing to dribbling up the court was a hassle. Gonzaga simply would not allow the Trojans to get into any rhythm.
“We didn’t do our part offensively. It was a little unusual because we had been playing so well offensively,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We haven’t been turning the ball over; we’ve been making shots and playing together as a team. I thought we got sped up a little bit at times during the first half because we were trying too hard after our slow start.”
Despite Gonzaga’s dominance, USC showed fight throughout the game. The Trojans briefly cut the lead down to 13 with 4:29 left after an 8-0 run prompted a timeout from the Bulldogs. And in the second half, USC matched Gonzaga’s total points. Nevertheless, the slow start in the first half hurt the Trojans’ chances of pulling off the comeback. 
Gonzaga sophomore forward Drew Timme came out with a vengeance, carrying the Bulldogs with 13 points and three steals in the game’s first few minutes. Timme finished with 23 points, shooting just over 52% from the field. 
Alongside Timme, Gonzaga’s other All-Americans freshman guard Jalen Suggs and senior forward Corey Kispert showed up in a big way. Suggs had 18 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Kispert added 18 points and eight rebounds.
After blisteringly hot shooting from the 3-point line prior to the matchup with Gonzaga, USC noticeably cooled off, shooting only 26% from beyond the arc — 38% from the field overall.
The loss for the Trojans puts the college career of outstanding freshman forward Evan Mobley to a likely end. Evan was named the Pac-12 Player, Defensive and Freshman of the Year earlier this month — the first player since Kentucky’s Anthony Davis in 2012 to win all three of these awards in a major conference.
Enfield emphasized just how special a player Mobley became. 
“Evan is the most unselfish superstar we’ve ever coached. He’s a team player, he’s unassuming, he’s humble and he just works every day to get better,” he said. “He’s going to have a bright future in the NBA because one thing about Evan Mobley is he’s a flat out winner, and we’re exceptionally proud of him and happy to coach him. He’s going to be a Trojan forever.”
Even though the Trojans finished the season on a disappointing note, this year’s team will be remembered as one of the best in school history. Hampered by the difficulties imposed by coronavirus protocols, Enfield said most of the coaching staff hadn’t met half of the new squad in person until September 2020, just over two months before the season started in late November. 
Enfield had high praise for the squad and their accomplishments. 
“In my coaching career, I have never seen a team develop a chemistry and a culture on and off the court like this team has. They improved dramatically from the start of training camp, throughout the season,” he said. “I think you saw it in the NCAA tournament; we became a very good basketball team… This is a very special team in USC basketball history.”

When Cara Zhu, a third year in the Master of Social Work program, was a teenager struggling with anxiety and depression, the assistance she received from social workers not only gave her support but also inspired her to become someone like them, kick-starting her dream to pursue social work. With the lack of Asian representation in the social work field, making up less than 3.5% of social workers in the United States, Zhu felt obligated to tackle mental health issues specific to Asian Americans.
Now, more than ever, with anti-Asian racism rampant in the United States, the unique challenges the older Asian population are facing need to be addressed — that’s why Zhu wrote a proposal for the Sunrise Project and submitted it to the Schmidt Futures Reimagine Challenge. 
The Sunrise Project is a culturally-adapted community-based online mental health service for Asian adults who are 65 and older in Los Angeles County, and provides a telehealth service delivered in Asian languages, since most American social work services are only offered in English and Spanish. 
Her proposal features three components: drop-in telehealth sessions with therapists, technology workshops that teach older adults how to access technology and a community outreach service where social workers perform monthly home visits to chat with older people in their native language, as well as interpret over-the-counter medication instructions.
Zhu’s primary goal is to provide family therapy and support to youth and troubled teens who are suffering from depression, anxiety and mental illness. Though her long-term goal is to establish child protective services in China, Zhu focused on the older Asian community for her proposal to the Reimagine Challenge because of the heightened racial tensions she observed against the Asian community throughout the pandemic. The recent shootings of Asian-Americans in Atlanta are a striking example of the growing anti-Asian hate as a result of the pandemic.
Zhu said currently, older Asian adults are hesitant to go to the park, pharmacy or even the gas station to fuel their car because they are scared they will be attacked. For adults who are not living with their children, and have a partner who has passed away, loneliness is a major struggle, which Zhu learned about in her “Loss, Grief and Bereavement” class that she recently took with Dr. Dawn Joosten-Hagye. 
“I took a class called Loss and Grief, and we learn a lot about how to work with older adults who are coping with a loss in their life,” Zhu said. “It’s very inspirational, and also I would say, my father is one of my most important inspirations. Because I told him that I wanted to participate in this scholarship, but I didn’t know what to write about, [and] I said, ‘oh, my father is next to me. I can write something about you.’” 
“Loss, Grief and Bereavement,” taught by Joosten-Hagye, a clinical associate assistant professor of social work specializing in working with disabled adults, is a class about normative and non-normative types of loss that happen throughout the life course. Hagye also emphasized the importance of providing culturally appropriate support and validation for disenfranchised patients. This class greatly inspired Zhu when she noticed the lack of culturally-appropriate services for older Asians amid the racial tension of the pandemic.
“In the class they learn about loss, grief and bereavement theories, and then they also learn about the importance of culture and spirituality in terms of how it helps people work through and understand the loss,” Joosten-Hagye said. “Loss related to the pandemic [is] something that we talked a lot about collectively in the course, because everyone was experiencing the pandemic and having many of the routines of day-to-day life changing pretty much overnight … created these normative types of grief responses [which are] very tied to what we learn from our own culture, spirituality and family.” 
Zhu conducted extensive research on the current services and limitations Asians and Pacific Islanders across L.A. face, and found a lack of accessibility, availability and data regarding mental health services for older Asians. While writing her proposal, Zhu sought help from Dr. Michal Sela-Amit, a clinical associate professor of social work specializing in child, youth and family social work. 
“She’s onto something really important here because I’m telling you, this is a big issue in terms of Asian communities here in the area of Los Angeles,” Sela-Amit said. “There is a need for more care, more information, more support, so they’re not going to be dealing with such loneliness and anxiety and depression and the feeling of really not being in your home country but still not being at home here either, fully.” 
According to Zhu, China’s social work industry is still in its infancy because there is a lack of funding and awareness for the importance of social work. Because the family unit used to be the support system for Chinese individuals, migration to big cities and development caused that social fabric to break, leading to the need for education around a culturally-sensitive social work system. Sela-Amit, who worked in China at Nanjing University through the Council of Social Work Education, saw firsthand that China needed to develop the profession of social work in response to the rapid urbanization changes. 
“The saying that I kind of adopted over the years is that you can change the way you dress, you can change the way you talk, but the cultural values stay with you the longest,” Sela-Amit said. “Sometimes we don’t see [culture] clearly, particularly in the United States, with all the ideas about individualism … but culture is the ingredient that gives us richness and meaning, and a lot of the time, direction, life, what’s important and what’s less important.”
Especially in the field of social work, cultural humility is important when interacting with clients who have an immigrant background, Joosten-Hagye said. 
“It’s really important that we talk about cultural humility, allowing our clients’ narratives and lived experiences … to come forward,” Joosten-Hagye said. “Our client is the expert over their experience, and though we’ve got some knowledge on some health resources, it’s important for us to be able to make sure that we establish a good fit between what our client’s preferences and values are, so that it’s more patient-centered, versus an assistant practitioner imposing something on them that may not be a good fit for them.” 
As someone with a Chinese background, cultural sensitivity is something Zhu excels in — allowing her to bring her in-depth understanding of the mental health stigma present in some Asian cultures to the table. 
“Usually, older adults will be scared of the term ‘mental health,’ so we use a more friendly term like ‘emotional well being,’” Zhu said. “We use ‘emotional well-being,’ ‘physical health,’ and ‘emotional health’ instead of being very straightforward [and] telling them, ‘oh, you need to join mental health services.’”
Though Zhu’s focus is on providing mental health treatment services to troubled youth and their families, she is passionate about providing social work services intergenerationally, and winning Sunrise Project is a major step forward in addressing both current and long term needs of the older Asian population, who have gone overlooked for far too long. She felt very honored to have been selected as a winner, and became even more motivated to continue developing her social work career and finding ways to assist marginalized communities in need.
“I saw the winner’s email before Christmas, so I think that it was the best Christmas present ever,” Zhu said. “I was very honored, but somehow, I do feel that actually I [could have done] it better. I think there’s still a lot of room for improvement.”

How long is the Trader Joe’s line? That’s the question so frequently asked by USC students that there is now an entire Instagram account dedicated to it: @howlongisthelineattraderjoes. As USC’s very own store has gained popularity on social media for talking about Trader Joe’s, others have also done the same. 
TikTok user @kel.drigo.gov gained her 23.1k followers because of Trader Joe’s. Yet, it is not for reasons you might think. She does not talk about all of the good(s) Trader Joe’s has to offer, nor does she give updates on the length of the line at her local Trader Joe’s. Instead, she brings to light how everyone’s favorite neighborhood grocery store has been left out of non-white neighborhoods. 
Kel represents this phenomenon by creating maps in which she adds the location of Trader Joe’s in a city with the racial dot map of the area. According to the Cooper Center’s Demographics Research Group at the University of Virginia — which is where Kel gets her maps from — “[their] racial dot map … provides an accessible visualization of geographic distribution, population density and racial diversity of the American people in every neighborhood in the entire country.”
With a clear picture of racial demographics within cities and suburbs and the various locations of Trader Joe’s in those neighborhoods accompanying them, it is hard to deny that white neighborhoods are the only places with multiple locations of the market. While areas with high Latinx, Black and Asian populations do not even have one location within their radii. 
Users comment on Kel’s videos suggesting cities she should create maps for. In major cities such as Chicago, New York, Houston, Atlanta and Los Angeles the trend is the same.
When creating the map of Los Angeles, it was not even surprising to Kel that another major city in the United States had Trader Joe’s in predominantly white, wealthy neighborhoods. Different to her previous videos, she decided to combine L.A.’s environmental risk map with the locations of Trader Joe’s saying:
“It’s basically an inverse of the Trader Joe’s map, it shows in red where residents’ health is most severely and negatively impacted by environmental factors. The white neighborhoods are green, so instead of having a reasonably priced organic kale, L.A.’s Black and Latino residents have toxic waste.”
With this map, she added the element of environmental racism as another point of inequality. Of course, it is outrageous to say that Trader Joe’s locations correlate directly with environmental racism; however, it is interesting to compare these factors. 
Marginalized groups tend to live in areas with environmental dangers, which also means that maps of Trader Joe’s would be the exact opposite of environmental risk maps. Simply put, the areas with higher environmental risk would not have a Trader Joe’s in sight, and those with lower environmental risk would have a handful of Trader Joe’s to choose from. 
Kel received a lot of flack for not including the USC Trader Joe’s on the map. However, she explained, in her own way, that including this location was not important. This one Trader Joe’s does not solve the problem, especially since the only reason that this Trader Joe’s is here is because of USC — a private institution with privilege that has gentrified the South Central community. 
The truth of the matter is that Trader Joe’s is not the only grocery store that is associated with wealthy, white communities. Travel through any major city and it will be apparent that plenty of other chains have decided to exclude their storefronts in non-white neighborhoods. For all of us here at USC, we don’t think twice about having a Trader Joe’s just blocks away from where we live, but what Kel has brought to light is just how much of a luxury that is. 
The next time you go to Trader Joe’s to get your favorite snack or to buy your favorite frozen meal, remember that it is a privilege to have inexpensive, affordable meals at your disposal. Many families who could benefit from these resources do not.

In recent times, minimum wage has become a hotly debated topic in U.S. politics; specifically, the Raise the Wage Act which would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. The primary talking points on the issue are what defines a basic living wage and unemployment. Those in favor of the bill believe that a higher minimum wage is necessary for economic survival for employees, and those against it argue that businesses suffer from increased costs, resulting in laying off those employees.
Outside any economic argument, there is a deeper cultural issue with minimum wage in the United States — namely how low earning jobs are stigmatized in society. Those with low economic status are regarded callously, both by these individuals themselves and those around them.
The disrespect toward lower economic classes is rooted in the fundamentals of the American Dream, however, it is absurd to believe that wealth has a connotation of a hardworking nature, instead of luck. A report conducted by Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce indicates that wealth, not ability, is the best measure of future success, regardless of the field. 
Additionally, one can estimate their own personal opportunity through The Opportunity Atlas, which uses metrics such as race, location and parental income to determine one’s future.
The U.S. has the cultural problem of viewing employment as transformative — a constant progression towards a higher earning career. Assuming that everyone has the capacity to escape minimum wage employment degrades those without the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, this line of thinking is particularly ironic during the pandemic, where minimum wage jobs became more important than ever. Front-line workers make up 60% of those who would benefit from a $15 minimum wage.
While many consider the minimum wage job to be a “starter job,” 28% of Americans earn less than $15 an hour, suggesting that it has been the living wage for many. Additionally, minimum wage workers are more likely to be women, people of color and immigrants who rely on entry-level jobs to support themselves. Therefore, pay inequality exacerbates gender, racial and immigrant inequity. 
During the pandemic, financial circumstances have become increasingly difficult for low earners, specifically in Los Angeles. A USC report details the economic impact of the coronavirus on marginalized communities in L.A. County, highlighting an array of disparities between white communities who were able to more easily pay rent, receive vaccinations and reopen schools versus predominantly Black, Indigenous people and people of color populations who suffered increased housing insecurity, minimal vaccination rollout attention and dismal opportunities around school reopenings.
What is the answer to the plight of the low-wage worker in the U.S.? 
One solution would be valuing previous work experience more in the application for higher-earning jobs. Currently, a resume padded with internships is valued above one with minimum wage experience, which reinforces the fallacy of upward mobility from a minimum wage job. While experience in a professional environment is useful, the skills learned in customer service are universally helpful and valuable.
There’s already an argument that everyone should work in retail at some point in their lives; a job at a clothing store can help one develop teamwork and interpersonal skills through navigating difficult customers. Furthermore, nothing proves a candidate’s competence and commitment more than maintaining a job long term, especially in a less glamorous role.
If working a minimum wage job was more generally mandated for higher-earning jobs in the future, the people who are eventually selected for those careers would have a broadened perspective of the reality of minimum wage work. 
People who have that formative experience earlier in their careers are likely to have a greater sense of empathy for those from different economic situations. Arguing against a minimum wage is almost impossible if one experiences the working conditions directly. Emphasizing the actual value of low-wage jobs culturally and within all career trajectories would create a broader cultural interest in achieving greater equity.

Twice a year, Americans go through the painstaking process of changing the time on every single clock in their household. Daylight saving time, for the residents of Hawaii and Arizona who may be blissfully unaware given that their states do not participate, is when clocks are set an hour ahead of standard time for the spring and summer. Brought to the United States by the Nazis in the 1940s, the primary purpose of this was to conserve energy to continue WW2. 
Yet, recent scientific data has shown that daylight saving increases energy consumption by 1%. In addition, the desynchronization of clocks with our bodies has been associated with serious health complications. This task is an inconvenience, especially for USC students abroad who already have to deal with time zone differences. With 71% of Americans wanting to halt this ritual, the time has come to stop “springing forward” in time.
People assume that by sacrificing their sleep, and in some cases their sanity, they will ultimately conserve more energy by using less light. They are correct in that there is a proven decrease in consumption of electricity for lighting. However, researchers argue that daylight saving increases demand for cooling in summer evenings and heating in spring and summer mornings. This has resulted in a 1% uptick in energy consumption with daylight saving time. In Indiana, studies found that the extra hour cost households an additional $9 million a year. In other words, the process is energy intensive and cost ineffective.
The time change is also linked to increased heart attacks and strokes. This is because each cell in our bodies keeps track of the time for biological processes. When the clocks go forward, the human body detects changes in daily patterns. This triggers stress signals in our brains, causing sleep deprivation, disorientation and memory loss.
Some scientists even argue that the desynchronization of clocks has mutated our clock gene, which tracks our sleep-wake schedule. This could lead to dysfunctions in cardiac functions. Daylight saving time is not just some nagging task on our to do list — it can seriously damage our health.
Since the advent of Zoom University, students are scattered across the globe while taking online classes. International students already have to grapple with 16-hour time differences, with many transitioning to a nocturnal life to be able to attend classes. Adding an extra hour, only to take it away three months later, is confusing and detrimental to their educational experience. Moreover, 60% of nations worldwide don’t use daylight saving.
The argument that daylight saving time is beneficial is a myth. California has already attempted to vote on eliminating the time change ritual, with 60% of voters approving the proposition in 2018. But, thanks to the bureaucracy that plagues the United States, the proposal stalled in the California State Senate and was never passed.
It is USC’s responsibility to push for this proposal again, for the health and sanity of our students. Student organizations could reach out to state and federal representatives, urging the California State Senate Committee on Energy, Utilities and Communications to bring up the Daylight Saving proposal (AB-7) in the next legislative session. This could be done through consistent lobbying. Then, hopefully with USC’s seal of approval, the will of the voters may be enacted, and daylight saving time will be eradicated.
