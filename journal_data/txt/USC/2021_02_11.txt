The Spring 2021 Undergraduate Student Government budget of $642,610 was approved by a near majority vote during Tuesday’s Senate meeting, making adjustments to the Concerts Committee fund and confirming the Accessibility Fund from last week. Senators also discussed ways to support students affected by the military coup in Myanmar.
Three thousand dollars of the Concerts Committee funds were transferred to the Performing Arts Committee for a sponsorship event, with the latter committee originally receiving no additional funds for the Spring 2021 semester. With the largest allocation of funds, the Concerts Committee is now set to receive $172,000.  
Last week, Chief Programming Officer Jina Hur announced that the Budget Committee met with various programming organizations that specified no need for additional funds. Concerts Committee Co-Director Samantha Gibbs confirmed that funds not used by the committee would be returned to USG and other organizations. 
Nine out of the ten senators voted to approve the amendment, with Sen. Dario Arganese as the lone “no” vote. Despite the opposed vote, the senators met the threshold of seven votes to confirm the amendment.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Arganese said his vote was based on ensuring that the Concerts Committee would be able to use the appropriate amount of funds to ensure their events, which are still pending, followed health and safety protocols during the pandemic. However, Arganese said he would have changed his vote had he known the transfer of funds was approved beforehand.
“If I knew [about the transfer] before, I probably would have voted yes,” Arganese said. “Mental health is number one, and I’d love to see any sort of initiative to have some sort of entertainment for students at USC.” 
Speaker of the Senate Ruben Romeo also presented his proposal to address the mental health crisis on campus. One of his solutions included USG and recognized student organizations to use To Be Honest Mental Health, a third party vendor to serve the mental health needs of students. Romeo emphasized that the inclusion of TBH would incentivize recognized student organizations to make student programming more impactful and approachable by prioritizing student well-being “based on identity and lived experiences.”
“[Students] will be paired into sessions with coaches or clinicians … They really get into the application of mental health and thriving in real time,” Romeo said.
Romeo also mentioned the coup crisis affecting Myanmar and encouraged those in attendance to find ways to be helpful, including asking his fellow peers to donate to the “Support the Civil Disobedience Movement in Myanmar” on GoFundMe, created by Civil Disobedience Movement Myanmar. The military coup began Feb. 1, when the country’s military launched an overthrow of and took over the newly elected government and leaders.
USG members have noted the importance of supporting students from inside and outside of Myanmar affected by the situation. Due to the shutdown of financial transactions and the military control of the Internet, students from Myanmar have difficulty paying their tuition statements and doing class assignments.
“Please keep the publicity around the Myanmar crisis that’s happening right now,” Romeo said. “Myanmar is trying to fight for democracy. They won 80% of their election to the party that won, and that person [of the winning party is] detained right now; that democracy is being threatened and people are having trouble fighting against the violent military when they’re protesting peacefully.”
Other members also shared sentiments in solidarity with Burmese students, including Sen. Lennon Wesley III. He noted students who dealt with stresses of college while also being impacted by the situation.
“Anyone with a heart would feel for everything that’s going on in Myanmar, especially students at USC,” said Wesley in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’re having to deal with that at the same time. USG has really done a good job being aware and understanding of that situation. And not only having an interest in that issue, but also just kind of making plans to help.”
Vice President Trinity Moore announced that she and Chief Financial Officer Lucille Warren met with the Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX to discuss ways that the office and its services can be “more palpable and more accessible to students.” 
“I’ve been working on the issue of misconduct report systems on our campus since I started my role,” said Warren in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “A lot of this time has been trying to understand the different options that students currently have. … I’ve talked a lot about making training modules part of compliance.”
After Moore’s announcements, Warren provided updates on her projects, such as the creation of a Religious Life Council, a resolution with the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation and a proposal for an Accessibility Cultural Center. She also proposed other initiatives including a Housing Policy Awareness Campaign and settlement promises related to the George Tyndall case.
“With the Tyndall settlement promises, the University made all this list of promises in response to students’ demands saying that these were things that they were going to do,” she said. “However, the transition to online. I think it’s been forgotten about … I think it’s taking a look at that long list and finding ways that we as students as USG can see through some of those promises.”
At the end of the meeting, Chief Communications Officer Shreya Chaudhary announced her nominations for the Spring 2021 creative services director, associate director and assistant director, due to the absence of a director currently. Chaudhary nominated Kros Day, a junior majoring in communication, Gloria Guo, a junior majoring in economics and art and Janelle Elise Hizon, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering, for the respective positions. The Senate will vote on the nominations at next week’s meeting.

Warner Bros.’ recent decision to allow streaming of all of its new movies on HBO Max in 2021 is facing controversy. The studio’s plan will enable its 17 slated movies to debut in cinemas and its online streaming service at the same time. 
The pandemic has dealt a significant blow to the film industry, with over 5,400 theaters closing down in 2020. In order to counter the negative impact, film studios such as Walt Disney and Universal Pictures have already changed their plans for theatrical releases and allowed streaming of their new films either partly or exclusively online.
Usually, newly-released movies will be exclusively shown in theaters and stay in a theatrical window for about three months before appearing on streaming platforms. For theaters, this serves as their main source of income. However, the value of this distribution model decreases during the pandemic as more and more film studios are concentrating on streaming platforms. Warner Bros.’ decision to stream its own movies on HBO Max can also be seen as a sign to promote their platform and make it a strong competitor against Netflix and Disney+. 
Even though Warner Bros.’ decision only applies to movies that will be released this year, many believe it has changed the future landscape of the film industry. Film directors and talent agencies have expressed their disappointment toward this issue. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan, who has been working with Warner Bros. since 2002, is a strong proponent of theaters. He vehemently criticized HBO Max, calling it “the worst streaming service.” Denis Villeneuve, the director of “Dune,” also stated that Warner Bros.’ parent company, AT&T, has “absolutely no love for cinema, nor for the audience here,” and is sacrificing Warner Bros.’ 2021 productions to “grab the audience’s attention.”
Theaters are not the only group that suffers from this change in movie distribution. The directors, actors and members of the crew will also face new challenges because their direct revenue also comes from the theaters. Warner Bros. did not negotiate with its clients before announcing its new streaming strategy. This affects the original contracts they signed and brings out controversies over the amount of compensation that they may receive. This also discourages movie talents from working with the studio.
Movie theaters are and should remain the most ideal place for the audience to watch movies because they provide the best visual and sound experience. Unlike computer and TV screens, the big screens are better at exhibiting the colors, lighting and qualities of the film, and all the other works and efforts expended by the cinematographers and members of the lighting and grip crews. The massive speaker system in theaters also provides a much better sound quality, which helps to enhance the movie experience.
Movie theaters also provide the best atmosphere that allows the audience to fully immerse themselves in the movie experience with fewer disruptions from the outside world. Unlike watching a movie at home, where it can be paused and resumed at any second, the audience will need to dedicate an uninterrupted part of their time to focus on the storytelling, which makes their experience more special and memorable.
If streaming new films online becomes a regular practice, audiences may be discouraged from entering theaters to enjoy the best movie experience. What is more, movie theaters will take away the jobs of cinema staff and cause a higher unemployment rate within the industry. Given the fact that over 60% of the domestic theaters are closed, these employees are already having a hard time making ends meet. Hence, it is necessary for students to support the local business by going to cinemas to watch new films.
It is understandable that movie studios are trying to find an alternate plan to make up for their economic losses. However, this should only be a short-term change, and studios should go back to the traditional distribution system after the pandemic to protect the valuable and collective theater experience shared by the audience.

After 37 years of wrongful incarceration, three years on death row and over 2,600 days in solitary confinement, Robert DuBoise has not been compensated by the state of Florida for the time stolen from him. 
DuBoise wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps by joining the Air Force and then become a firefighter, just as his grandfather did. He also wanted to marry, have children and own a house, but this was impossible as he was confined in a dim cell for decades for a murder that he did not commit. Although nothing will remedy the time and opportunities lost, Florida refuses to atone for the mistake by offering DuBoise monetary compensation, which would help him build his new life from scratch.
On Feb. 1, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers took a stand to highlight the importance of compensation for wrongfully convicted individuals by honoring DuBoise through their 10-minute long video titled “Conviction: The Robert DuBoise Story.” 
The video begins with a multifaceted montage as Jeffri Chadiha of the National Football League encourages the viewer to recall the most memorable moments of their lives — weddings, birthdays, the birth of a child — and then tells them to imagine none of it had ever happened. With this emotional start, the viewer can begin to understand what wrongfully convicted people experience and why it is so important for them to be compensated for the time and moments they lost by being wrongfully incarcerated. 
Currently, 35 states, along with the District of Columbia and the federal government, allow for exoneree compensation. However, many of these states, including Florida, have shortcomings such as insufficient amounts of monetary compensation and paying exonerees privately. These states also include statutes for withholding or subtracting compensation from exonerees who were coerced into a confession or plea deal, have pre-existing felony convictions or when the case was much more intentional than a simple error. Exonerees have already suffered so much, and they should be compensated in a way that does not add any more trauma or distress.
The Buccaneers became committed to helping DuBoise after Ali Marpet, offensive guard for the team, came across an article published following DuBoise’s exoneration. After hearing DuBoise’s story, the Buccaneers reached out to the Innocence Project to help him in accordance with their social justice project. They also gave DuBoise four tickets to the Super Bowl and $25,000 to help lift him up on his feet.
“I know I didn’t do it,” DuBoise said in the video. “I just had to live with this anguish inside my heart that this is actually happening to me.”
Some states such as Florida, Alabama and Michigan offer $50,000 per year wrongfully incarcerated while other states such as California, Iowa and Michigan pay based on the amount of days each person was wrongfully convicted. The maximum compensation allowed varies by state; some set limits at $1-2 million, and others pay damages on a case by case basis. There are still 15 states that do not provide any type of compensation. 
DuBoise’s story is not an isolated incident. Many individuals fail to receive compensation from states that legally allow for it, including Clemente Aguirre-Jarquin, who was exonerated in 2018 and not compensated by Florida despite spending over a decade on death row for murders he did not commit.
In the video, the Buccaneers recalled the incredible gratitude for freedom that DuBoise had. They took a moment to acknowledge milestones that they would have missed had they been wrongfully convicted: Marpet said that DuBoise had been convicted 10 years longer than he had even been alive, and Donovan Smith, offensive tackle, said that he would have missed getting his college degree, being drafted and seeing the birth of his daughter. 
For DuBoise, this is not a what if situation. He did miss what would have been some of the most memorable moments of his life — birthdays, holidays and the birth of his nieces, according to Susan Friedman, Innocence Project attorney. Instead, he survived the impending fear of the death penalty, sent out letters asking for help and watched people he had gotten to know be taken away to death watch, shortly before they were executed. DuBoise spent 37 years trying to prove his innocence, something that should have never been disputed in the first place.
With this haunting message, we should take a moment to think about the greatest moments of our lives and how we would feel if they had been stolen from us. Nothing in the world would remedy the despair, hurt, anxiety and the unpreparedness from the meager reintegration programs prisons offer, but compensation money would be the means for a new start.

USC women’s golf won the Lamkin San Diego Invitational tournament at The Farms Golf Club in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. on Monday and Tuesday. 
Though UCLA scored better than the Trojans by one stroke in the second round, the Trojans remained in first place throughout all three rounds finishing with a final team score of 16-over par. TCU and UCLA tied for second place, both finishing 40 over par. 
Graduate student Allisen Corpuz had the tournament’s lowest score with a two-under-par 214, while four of the five Trojans on the team finished within the top 10. 
Junior Katherine Muzi finished in seventh place with a 6-over-par 222. Freshman Brianna Navarrosa finished just behind Muzi tied for eighth place with an 8-over-par 224. Senior Alyaa Abdulghany made a birdie on the eighteenth hole of her last round to secure her place in the top ten, and senior Amelia Garvey finished with an 11-over-par 227 that included two eagles. 
Head coach Justin Silverstein commented on Abdulghany and Garvey’s performances: “I think they both would have been a little rusty – they hadn’t played as many tournament rounds as they normally do come this time of year – but they looked really good and I think this will be a good step going forward into next week with a bigger event in Phoenix.” 
Overall, Silverstein was pleased with all of his players’ performances, especially on the Farms’ challenging golf course. Opening the season with a challenging course, Silverstein added, will make clear to his players the aspects of their game that they need to focus on before their next tournament.  
“That’s the kind of golf course we like to start our spring season on,” Silverstein said. “It’ll expose you if you’re off and reward you if you’re on.” 
Muzi, who according to Silverstein had her best-ever performance as a Trojan, said she was particularly focused on her mental game. This focus included remaining “calm and patient” throughout the tournament as well as forgetting bad shots as quickly as possible. Muzi’s mental game was especially important on the back nine of her third round.
“I was four over through ten because I hit one out of bounds. After that I was getting really nervous,” Muzi said. “I was able to calm myself down, and then I made a clutch birdie on twelve and thirteen, and then I drained a 90-footer on seventeen … that was probably the highlight of the tournament.” 
Coach Silverstein provided a confident outlook on the season to come. The Trojans finished the 2019 season in first place, and won two events back-to-back in 2020 before last season was cancelled. 
“We think any lineup we throw out there is good enough to win every tournament we play regardless of who else is in the field,” Silverstein said. 
Despite this optimistic outlook, USC will have to work through the challenges of some coronavirus related restrictions. The team can still work out together but players have had to adapt to playing with a mask on and maintain an at-home workout regimen. 
Currently the Trojans cannot use their short-game practice facility and indoor hitting area without coaches being present. As a result, Silverstein explained that players have been forced to spend less time practicing and more time driving to golf courses in the area.
The Lamkin Invitational marked a strong start to the season for the Trojans, who are now looking forward to Arizona State’s Sun Devil Winter Classic next Monday. 
The tournament in Scottsdale will be an important opportunity for Silverstein and company to see how they stack up against more of their Pac-12 competition.

Several weeks ago, I was watching a game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The game was tied, and Nets point guard Kyrie Irving was called for an offensive foul with 1.5 seconds remaining in regulation. The call was challenged, reviewed and overturned in favor of the Nets. 
Because the Cavs were over the foul limit, Irving should have shot two free throws and the Nets likely would have won the game with such little time on the clock. However, because the ball was loose when play was stopped, the result of the overturned call was a jump ball. The fourth quarter ended, and the Cavs went on to win in double overtime. 
How is this the proper way to correct a bad call on the floor? The Nets did nothing wrong; they simply got fouled and the officials made a mistake. Yet they are punished for it by not having a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, even though they had the ball. 
This happens nearly every week in one sport or another, and instant replay review is often only time consuming and frustrating; it seems to rarely affect the game in a positive manner.
Another classic example presented itself this week at the end of a game between the New York Knicks and the Miami Heat. A loose ball foul was called on the floor against power forward Julius Randle and the Knicks. The call was reviewed to determine if it should be changed to a flagrant foul. 
During the review, it was quite clear that forward Kelly Olynyk of the Heat committed a foul before the foul in question occurred. While this must have been obvious to the officials, it could not be retroactively called a foul, thus Heat retained possession. The rules do not allow a play to be reviewed for a foul if a foul was not called, and a review also may only change the outcome of exactly what is being reviewed. 
So, Olynyk’s foul was irrelevant because the review was looking at Randle’s foul. 
Why are these rules so particular? Why can’t the correct call be applied based on what actually happened on the court? In Irving’s case, why was the result of an overturned call different than if it had been called correctly to begin with? 
Furthermore, the limitations on what can and can’t be reviewed by the officials or by the coaches seem arbitrary. The New Orleans Saints lost the 2018 NFC Championship game after maybe the worst pass-interference no-call in NFL history. A simple challenge could have changed the course of the season, but instead the Los Angeles Rams would advance to the Super Bowl. 
The rule has since been changed to make pass interference calls and no-calls reviewable, but was changed back after one season. Regardless, sports leagues cannot wait until a team gets robbed of its chance to advance to the Super Bowl before addressing these inconsistent rules. 
The list of issues I have with replay review goes on. In the NBA, coaches are allowed one challenge per game whether their initial challenge was successful or not. If the wrong call is made on the floor, and the coach of a team is forced to use their challenge to correct it, then that team should not pay the price of the referee’s mistake by losing its only challenge. 
Replay review was originally created for things like seeing if the receiver had both feet in bounds on a catch. In reality, the “right call” often isn’t what’s important. The result of a review is frequently determined by the call on the field in the first place. It begs the question, should pro sports leagues just do away with replay review entirely?
FiveThirtyEight found that 41% of reviews in the NFL from 2011 to 2016 resulted in an overturned call. While this seems like a significant number, it really isn’t given that it’s 41% of calls that were questionable enough to warrant an official review or coach’s challenge to begin with. 
If replay review in various sports leagues can be fixed to establish some consistency and emphasis on making the correct call, independent of the cause of the review, then even a relatively small number of overturned calls would be made for the better. But currently, the inconsistency and flaws of replay review rules seems to do more harm than good. 
Suggesting an abandonment of challenging calls and replay review may feel like a very strong reaction; however, it’s a difficult problem to approach. You can address these individual concerns one by one, but it’s hard to imagine there won’t just be more unpredictable controversies like the infamous Dez Bryant catch decision that went against the Dallas Cowboys wide receiver in 2015. 
You can change the rules after the fact, but the damage is already done for the Cowboys, the Saints and the Nets. In order to create a fair playing environment, void of contentious outcomes and contradictions in challenged plays, something has to change. If leagues can’t come up with rules that solve all of these problems and more, the best approach might just be to abolish replay review completely.

Her 2020 album “Hues” explores the complexities of a toxic, failing relationship. Set against jazzy, smoky drums and bass chords, Hues’ melodic voice shines especially bright. The bouncy rhythm in “Lay Up” is reminiscent of Mary J. Blige and Dionne Warwick, both of whom Hues cites as inspirations, while the stripped-back tracks “Desert Flower” and “Death on the Vine” showcase Hues’ emotive vocals. Pulling inspiration from R&B, psychedelia, rock and jazz, Hues manages to sculpt a music style that is emotional, feminine, nostalgic and uniquely hers.
AG Club
“Everyone is in the club, unless you’re not. AND YOU WILL KNOW IF YOU’RE NOT,” AG Club told i-D in an interview last year. Hailing from the East Bay Area, AG Club is loosely composed of about eight musicians, with Baby Boy, Jody Fontaine and Mick Antony making up the core trio.
Similar to Brockhampton in their approach to music and band structure, AG Club captures both the energy of a young, all-male rap group and American urbanity. Their bold, youthful lyrics in “Memphis” (now remixed with features from A$AP Ferg and NLE Choppa) reflect AG Club’s upward trajectory: “Still screaming ‘F*ck you pay me/ Please don’t try to educate me’ / A.G. never hesitating.” 
But the group doesn’t get too lost in the clouds; their shimmering yet solemn track “Hngover” is an ode to universal young-adult angst, with lyrics such as: “Always saw myself as less than perfect / Lil less than worth it / Lookin’ at what’s on the surface / Wondering if I deserve it.” Consistent in their passionate lyrics and echoey instrumentals, AG Club has retained their ability to mix and switch genres on each track of their 2020 album, “Halfway Off the Porch.”
Dua Saleh
Sudanese American singer Dua Saleh cannot be constricted by labels. They grew up listening to Sudanese music, 1940s jazz and 1990s hip-hop, and while these influences are undeniably apparent in their music, Saleh has successfully established their own unique style.
With sculptural, fluid vocals and textured production, Saleh’s music tiptoes near the edge of psychedelia in terms of both instrumentation and lyrics, with their poetic lines in “Warm Pants” illustrating trippy visuals: “I need you now / Found all that smoke that clouds / The shadows that keep leakin’ out your house / You throwin’ daggers at the crown / There’s liquor fallin’ from you mouth.”
Saleh also incorporates Arabic into a few of their songs in the hopes of connecting to their Sudanese fanbase, especially closeted queer, trans and non-binary listeners. Saleh told City Pages that listening to queer artists such as Mykki Blanco, Le1f and Kilo Kish “saved [their] life” when they were younger. Futuristic but warm, lush but clear, Dua Saleh’s music is an organic, growing art to keep an eye out for.
Tems
At only 25 years old, singer Tems is already taking the Nigerian and U.S. music scenes by storm. Her powerful, impassioned voice has earned her two Headies awards and a collaboration with Khalid and Davido on the 2020 track “Know Your Worth.” Her music undoubtedly has roots in R&B and pop, but Tems is part of “alté,” a powerful, youthful Nigerian music scene where creativity and nonconformity are the only rules. 
Many alté artists attribute their inspiration to the 1990s Nigerian music scene and contemporary indie acoustics. In an interview with British Vogue, Tems described alté as “a small but strong force of bold, strong and courageous people thinking outside the norm in the Nigerian space.” Tems also noted the artistic freedom of the alté scene, saying: “[The musicians are] original, they’re being themselves and nobody can give them their approval. Nobody can give you that apart from God.”
Berwyn
Though sometimes heartbreaking in its naked emotion and raw lyrics, Berwyn’s music holds the same soft comfort as J. Cole’s “She’s Mine Pt. 2” or Frank Ocean’s “Cayendo.” Born in Trinidad and Tobago but based out of London, Berwyn tells personal stories of abandonment, loneliness and lost potential in his recent album “DEMOTAPE / VEGA.” His tracks are often accompanied by a single, stripped piano, and while his gentle rapping fits well between chords, Berwyn’s singing voice is skillfully tender. 
Berwyn does not shy away from vulnerability with lyrics such as “I used to see your Mum every time I go visit mine in prison / Working nights at the front desk, just tryna feed her children” from “TRAP PHONE.” The singer outlines his hardships in “017 FREESTYLE,” his voice straining and breaking with pain near the end of the track as he recounts the distance between him and his family and the times his life didn’t go as planned. Though his work is highly personal, the artistry behind Berwyn’s songwriting will strike a chord in any listener.
BEAM
Miami-based Tyshane Thompson, who goes by the stage name BEAM was born in Jamaica to dancehall and gospel reggae icon Papa San. At 25 years old, BEAM is rapidly breaking into the hip-hop scene.
His EP “95” is energetic and aggressive. With Kid Cudi-esque rapping and production inspiration from 21 Savage and 2 Chainz, BEAM’s work is influenced by artists across the contemporary hip-hop spectrum. He’s also collaborated with Skrillex; in an interview with The Face, BEAM attributed his love for dubstep and EDM to the white friends he made when he moved to Miami at age eight.
His recent single “Delete” with Ape Drums is a rare combination of EDM and reggae. While some of his newer music is about partying, drugs and sex, BEAM emphasizes in an interview with The Face that he’s intent on including the dark sides of humanity along with the good — a radical break from his father’s gospel reggae: “It’s not an abomination to feel a certain type of way. Everyone has flesh, that’s what I really want to explain … I grew up in the church, and everyone I know is still human, has flaws, feels a certain type of way.”

Last year, as a record-breaking number of people took to the streets to protest police brutality, questions arose about the role that the USC Department of Public Safety plays at the University and in the surrounding community. Black students spoke up about unfair treatment from DPS, and student groups and activists issued lists of demands to fight racism on campus, including divesting from DPS and severing ties from the Los Angeles Police Department. USC faculty wrote a letter to President Carol Folt and DPS Chief John Thomas requesting, among other things, divestment from DPS.
Now, months later, USC’s DPS Community Advisory Board, which was started in response to the protests over the summer, is launching “Co-Design Public Safety Sessions” — a series of 10 sessions that aims to bring students, faculty, staff and neighbors together to discuss experiences with DPS, specific issues and recommendations for the future. The advisory board will put together the information that they find and report recommendations directly to President Folt. The sessions began on Feb. 8 and will last through Feb. 20.
Chief Thomas said that about four years ago, he participated in a similar committee to examine DPS practices and public safety. After a few meetings, however, the group fizzled out. This time, after the killing of George Floyd, he feels the end result will be better, and said he is committed to changing DPS.
Professors Ange-Marie Hancock Alfaro and Erroll Southers, co-chairs of the advisory board, both said they want these meetings to go beyond typical listening sessions where solutions are imposed from the top-down, or experiences are listened to but not acted upon.
Alfaro, dean’s professor of gender studies, said she wants the policy recommendations to come from listening to, working with and talking to the community. 
“Having people who have experienced the issue be at the center of the solution is our best chance at making things work,” she said. 
Southers, the other co-chair of the advisory board and professor of the practice in national and homeland security, said the goal of the board is to end the sessions with specific policy recommendations for improving public safety at USC. What the policy change could be, though, is unclear — and could vary widely, he said.
Southers said their recommendations could include increasing DPS funding to include social workers, increasing the amount of officers, replacing armed officers with social workers or completely divesting from the department.
“Nothing is off the table at this point,” Southers said. “We haven’t been given any kind of mission to discuss whether we abolish the department, or have twice as many officers. We’re really going to respond to what we’re hearing from people and what we all think is best to do.”
So far, the sessions have discussed the role of DPS — specifically what kinds of incidents DPS responds to, Alfaro said. In the group’s research, they found that DPS is the only 24/7 and 365-days-a-year organization on both the University Park and the Health Sciences Campuses, meaning that, according to Alfaro, they respond to anything from violent crime to disputes over parking spaces.
“When we think about the broad scope of things DPS is asked to do, is that really the right thing for DPS to be doing? To be resolving a parking situation? Or should DPS be called for very serious situations where only DPS should really be involved?” Alfaro said. “And so, I think that’s really one of the things we found out: that [DPS is] doing a lot for a lot of other organizations, and maybe the University should think about making sure that those organizations and those other academic units have the support that they need to do their work.”
Alfaro is encouraged that the board will have influence and follow through with its goals in large part because of the diverse range of members and commitment by the University.
“We have on the table, in terms of the people who are on the [board], everyone from somebody who is involved in the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter to former federal prosecutors to former law enforcement,” Alfaro said. 
Alfaro also said that these committees often fail when they only include the voices of people already committed to a specific method of change. On this board, she said, “we truly have everybody at the table,” and they are committed to listen to come up with solutions.
Chief Thomas said he took himself off of the advisory board to the co-design public safety sessions because he didn’t want people to feel uncomfortable sharing their experiences. 
“I’m not participating because in my view, I felt like I really want people to speak freely and openly, and if I’m there, people may be hesitant about criticizing the department, or even me, for that matter,” Thomas said.
Thomas compared himself to a kid at a candy store, excited to hear the feedback from the sessions whether it is positive or negative. As for his role, he is ready to act on any recommendations he is given. 
“Whatever they recommend, implement. Whatever comes out of those, I’m not going to be there to criticize,” he said. 
He does, however, hope to be able to provide some context. For example, if people say that the LAPD should not respond to incidents on campus, he would push back because he isn’t sure that is possible.
“[LAPD is] the municipal agency for all of L.A.,” he said. “I would weigh in on something like that because people pay their taxes in this area for police services.”
Southers addressed the Board’s transparency as a way to make sure that they are held accountable, citing their website, social media use, Universitywide emails and efforts to spread the word.
“Nothing’s worse than coming to a session like that, sharing your experience and feeling like it was a waste of time, or nothing’s going to happen,” Southers said. “We want [attendees] to feel better. We also want them to feel that something’s going to happen. Because by the way, by the end of next semester, we will have our first set of recommendations to President Folt.”
A previous version of this article stated that USC Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas started a committee to examine DPS practices and public safety four years ago. Chief Thomas did not start that committee, however he did participate in it. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Harry Styles in a dress isn’t as iconic as you think it is. (Yes, I know I am two months late. Deal with it.)
When I first saw Harry Styles wearing a lacy blue Gucci dress on the December cover of Vogue, I was quite impressed by the progressiveness many aren’t used to in men’s fashion, but then it hit me: I’ve definitely seen this before. Where you may ask? Black male musicians.
Over the past few years, Black men’s fashion norms have been challenged by rappers and singers who’ve decided to swap out a standard suit for a dress. With this difference in clothing, many of these men were met with reactions that were quite the opposite of the “Watermelon Sugar” singer.  
Starting a few years ago in 2016 on the cover of his mixtape, “Jeffrey,” Young Thug is pictured sporting a light blue ruffled dress. Once this picture circulated around the internet it received negative attention labeling Thug as ‘gay’ or ‘girly’ — which are among the more nicer things said.
The cover’s controversy even found itself referenced in the song, “Barbie Dreams” by Nicki Minaj two years after the incident. In the song, Minaj criticized Young Thug’s outfit choice rapping, “Used to f–k with Young Thug, I ain’t addressing this s–t. Caught him in my dressing room stealing dresses and s–t.” Even with the lyric labeled homophobic by some, Minaj emphasized how the song wasn’t a diss track.  
Happening at around the same time as Thug’s album cover, Jaden Smith began regularly wearing dresses to a variety of events ranging from Coachella to prom. Much like Young Thug, Smith received the same kind of comments, but in this case, the press publicized how his father, Will Smith, “had his feelings” about Jaden’s outfit choices after it was mentioned on an episode of “Red Table Talk.”
Jaden ended up coming to his own defense in a Nylon interview explaining that he would much rather normalize wearing dresses and take the hate targeted at him so that the next generation won’t have to. 
“I’m going to take most of the blows,” Smith said. “So, you know, in five years when a kid goes to school wearing a skirt, he won’t get beat up and kids won’t get mad at him.”
While Harry Styles was labeled a change-maker and icon — among a slew of other praise via Twitter — the reception of these Black artists in gender-bending clothing felt different. This was mainly because the concept of Black masculinity in the rap industry is held to an excessive standard. And in these cases, it was being threatened. 
Rap as a genre has been built off the idea that its artists should exude a certain level of emotional and physical strength. In many cases, rappers adhere to the stereotypes that have already been set for them, such as reputations of violence. Whether it be through gang affiliation or criminality, the rap industry has pushed an image of hypermasculinity to its audience and that’s become the expectation. As soon as they remove themselves from what is expected, like these rappers and their gender-defying clothing, it’s perceived as wrong.
But the rap industry isn’t the only place Black male artists are criticized either. Prince, who defied genre, has been the subject of ridicule because of his androgynous style since the ’80s. Broadway star Billy Porter has also been criticized for his recent eccentric award show dresses and outfits.  
What the music industry is seeing though is Black men’s willingness to step out of the stereotypes that were created for them instead of by them, which is progression in itself. As time goes on and minds become more open, Black artists and their fashion expression should get the much needed recognition it deserves. So before we label Styles “an icon,” we must recognize the others who’ve done it before and received a different kind of response.

Are you struggling to figure out what to watch post-Super Bowl Sunday? No fear, we’ve got you covered with these top picks available on your favorite streaming services this month. With tons of award-winning festival films and plenty of brand new content, your watchlist will be packed to the brim. Without further ado, here’s what to look out for this February:
Netflix
“Malcolm & Marie” — Feb. 5
A black-and-white romantic drama film written and directed by Sam Levinson and starring John David Washington and Zendaya, “Malcolm & Marie” focuses on lovers quarreling against the backdrop of the entertainment industry. Conceived and filmed in its entirety during the ongoing pandemic with a cast and crew of 22 members, the film sees Levinson and Zendaya teaming up once again after achieving great critical and commercial success with the ubiquitous teen drama series “Euphoria,” already generating considerable awards buzz. 
“iCarly” — Feb. 8
The first two seasons of seemingly everyone’s favorite Nickelodeon sitcom, “iCarly,” are finally landing on Netflix. Airing from 2007 to 2012, “iCarly” stars USC alumna Miranda Cosgrove and her best friends, played by Jennette McCurdy and Nathan Kress, as they navigate having a viral web show and living their lives as normal high school students in Seattle. The show remains one of Nickelodeon’s highest-rated in the network’s history and is popular with audiences of all ages. 
“Behind Her Eyes” — Feb. 17
This limited series, adapted from the 2017 novel of the same name, stars Simona Brown as a single mother who finds herself ensnared in an increasingly mysterious, dark and dangerous love triangle with her boss and his wife. Coming from the same British production company as Netflix’s hit series “The Crown,” the series is shaping up to be an attention-grabbing psychological thriller. 
“I Care a Lot” — Feb. 19
Having come out of the film festival circuit alive and well, “I Care a Lot” is a dark comedy thriller that stars Rosamund Pike of “Gone Girl” fame as a con artist who meets her match when her latest scheme lands her in trouble with an intimidating gangster figure. Directed by J Blakeson, the film has turned heads due to Pike’s Golden Globe award nomination for her performance in it. 
Hulu
“Framing Britney Spears” — Feb. 5
Released as part of The New York Times’ ongoing next day FX on Hulu series, this documentary examines famed American pop star Britney Spears’ meteoric rise to superstardom and the media frenzy and highly publicized fall that followed it. Taking special care to dissect the inner workings of the conservatorship which she continues to live under, director Samantha Stark attempts to expose the misogyny and legal hurdles Spears has had to overcome in order to fight for her autonomy. 
“Nomadland” — Feb. 19
The revered film festival gem of 2020, Chloé Zhao’s “Nomadland” is finally streaming this month. Starring seasoned veteran Frances McDormand as a woman who travels out West in the wake of immense personal and financial devastation, this character study has won countless awards before even seeing a wide release and has been favored to be a strong contender for Best Picture and Best Director at the Academy Awards this year. 
HBO Max
“Judas and the Black Messiah” — Feb. 12
Having only premiered at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival Feb. 1, “Judas and the Black Messiah” has already seen Daniel Kaluuya garner nominations for a Golden Globe award and a Screen Actors Guild award. The biographical drama, directed by Shaka King, follows the struggles and tensions between the leadership of the Black Panther Party and the FBI in 1960s Chicago. Having received glowing reviews across the board, Rotten Tomatoes’ critics’ consensus reads “An electrifying dramatization of historical events, ‘Judas and the Black Messiah’ is a forceful condemnation of racial injustice — and a major triumph for its director and stars.” 
“Tom & Jerry” — Feb. 26
Based on the instantly recognizable 1940s cartoon of the same name, “Tom & Jerry” is a mixed live-action/animated film that sees the return of one of television’s most iconic duos. The cat and mouse, constantly at odds with each other, find themselves united against a common foe against the backdrop of the Big Apple. Having been stuck in development hell ever since 2009, the film miraculously features archival voice recordings from the show’s creators, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. This revival of the franchise follows a years-long absence of it from popular culture.
