The Office of Residential Education will allow residents to bring two guests into on-campus residential spaces beginning Oct. 18, reversing the “no-guest” policy in effect since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The policy change, announced by the  department’s Senior Director Grant Burlew Wednesday in an email to residential assistants obtained by the Daily Trojan, will only apply to USC students.
The decision comes as the positivity rate on campus continues to decline — currently .1% for students and .2% for employees, a decrease from a semester high of .4% among students and 1% among employees. 
Guests will be required to show their Trojan Checks to enter residence halls, and residents must consult with roommates and suitemates for overnight guests. Guests will also not be allowed to stay for more than three nights in a row. 
In a student media briefing Tuesday, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said the Office of Residential Education would make a “significant change” to USC Housing guidelines by Oct. 18. 
In a previous media briefing Aug. 26, Van Orman said the no-guest policy was a regulation from the Los Angeles County of Public Health rather than the University. A spokesperson for the department, in a statement to the Daily Trojan, denied that USC’s policy was a directive from L.A. County. 
In a media briefing Sept. 28, Van Orman said the no-guest policy was a recommendation from the Center for Disease Control, and not because of local health regulations. 
The no-guest policy received some criticism among students who cited the contrast between the strict housing rules and crowded Welcome Week events.
Parker Weiss, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering who lives at USC Village, said the new policy will “make life on campus way more normal.”
“A lot of my friends are off campus [and] didn’t have any restrictions, all of the guys that are on campus are like ‘This is still kind of like a weird situation to be in,’” Weiss said. “But I think this helps to return to normal a lot.”
Ani Sarkisyan, a senior majoring in psychology, has worked as a resident assistant for two years. With the no-guest policy in place, her job is much easier because there have been less issues with resident write-ups and parties, she said.
At the same time, Sarkisyan said she believes the updated policy will make socializing easier for freshmen. 
“Especially for freshmen living in apartment-style housing, it’s so hard for them to meet people and interact,” Sarkisyan said. “So I’m kind of happy that it happened. Of course, for an RA, it’s a lot more work, but we kind of already did this before.”
Ian Cabeen, a sophomore majoring in psychology who lives at USC Village and is Weiss’s roommate, said, with the no-guest policy in place, he paid for Lyft’s to friends’ homes because he could not have people over in his apartment. 
“It’s gonna be really nice for us living in the Village, especially because we have spent so much money Lyfting around and going to other places to hang out with people,” Cabeen said. “We want to have people over and hang out at our house.”
In the email to resident assistants, Burlew said residents should meet with roommates and suitemates to “discuss what their expectations will be around shared space” in light of the new policy.
While Sarkisyan said she imagines there could be conflict for roommates who have different levels of comfort surrounding the coronavirus, the restriction of guests to USC students who have high rates of vaccination will help, she said.
“Everyone has to be OK with [having guests over] … Not everyone is as comfortable with COVID,” Sarkisyan said. “[But] the guest policy isn’t even as it was before. Before you could bring in anyone, but now it’s just like USC students. Most USC students are vaccinated, so I feel like USC did that on purpose.”
Gus Lanser, a resident assistant in McCarthy and senior majoring in chemical engineering, said he was “positively surprised” by the change because he can have his friends over and so his residents can have a better freshman experience. 
“During my freshman year hanging out with people from different dorms — the impact that had on my freshman year experience,” Lanser said. “And I really went for my residents to be able to experience that.”
Lanser also said before the semester started, he met with residents to discuss their comfort with having guests, thinking about both the guest policy at the time and future changes. Because of that, he said, he “doesn’t foresee any issues.”

The Office of Residential Education will make a “significant change” to existing USC Housing guidelines on Oct. 18, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a USC Student Health briefing Tuesday.
The “no-guest policy” — a coronavirus USC Housing guideline that prohibits students from entering other on-campus residential facilities — has been in effect since the beginning of the fall semester. In a briefing last week, Van Orman said the guideline was under active reconsideration. This policy was neither a directive from Los Angeles County or state public health orders, but a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Van Orman said the housing guideline is a Residential Education policy, not one from Student Health. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC Student Affairs wrote that the existing “no-guest policy” is subject to change as they monitor the positivity rate in USC Housing residences.
“We are hopeful that we will be able to relax the guest policy in the residential communities sometime in the fall. However, at this time, the guest restrictions remain in place,” the statement read. “As conditions change and guidelines allow, we will make appropriate changes to the restrictions and the Residential Education team will ensure that all residents are updated.” 
The developing news on the housing guidelines comes as weekly coronavirus cases and positivity rates continue to decline. Of the tests administered last week, 37 students tested positive for the coronavirus, yielding a positivity rate of 0.11% — the lowest case and positivity levels reported since the start of the fall semester. 
On Sept. 15, the Los Angeles County Health Department issued a public health order requiring employees and customers of some indoor venues and mega-outdoor events to present proof of vaccination. According to the L.A. County directive, residents must receive one dose of the coronavirus vaccination by Thursday and their second dose by Nov. 4 to enter these venues. 
In accordance with local health policy, Athletic Director Mike Bohn said the University will require all guests visiting campus or the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on gameday to present proof of vaccination or documentation of a negative coronavirus test taken no more than 72 hours prior to game time. Guests will also be required to complete Trojan Check, according to Bohn’s campuswide memo Tuesday.
USC will enforce the vaccine requirement by issuing wristbands to guests in compliance with the policy — enabling them to bypass the testing and vaccine verification process at the Coliseum. Guests under the age of 12 are exempt from the vaccine and testing requirement as the demographic remains ineligible to receive the coronavirus vaccine. 
Van Orman described upcoming events such as Trojan Family Weekend and fall recess as a “risk” to the progress established by the declining coronavirus trends but remains hopeful high vaccination rates will protect the campus community from experiencing another surge in cases. 
“We’re very hopeful with where we are. We see really good numbers in California, as well as here at USC. We do have two potential things coming; one is Trojan family weekend, which we know will have visitors, and just people coming from different parts of the U.S. will be a risk,” Van Orman said. “We’re hopeful given where case rates are now, our very high vaccination rates, that if we see any increase, it’ll be very modest.” 
Van Orman encouraged students to remain cautious and offered guidance for those who decide to travel during the approaching fall recess. 
“We’re just asking people to be cautious. Make sure you test if you’re traveling over midterm break — test before and test after,” Van Orman said. “We know that the community rates are much higher in certain parts of the country, and so also just being aware of what the [coronavirus] rates [are] where you’re going.” 
As coronavirus levels continue to stabilize throughout the campus community, Van Orman said Student Health is seeing other circulating respiratory illnesses. Among the infections reported include respiratory syncytial viruses, adenovirus and some cases of mono. 
“If you are actively ill with cold and flu symptoms, you should stay home,” Van Orman said. “You should get tested for COVID, and you can really prevent spreading that to someone else by staying home until your symptoms are improving.”
As of Oct. 5, Student Health has administered 2,000 flu shots and has seen zero confirmed cases of influenza — a trend Van Orman said she hopes to remain constant with flu vaccines now accessible for all students, faculty and staff. 
“We’ve been overwhelmed with [flu] vaccines … So, if you look at the schedule, it’s booked up until the end of October,” Van Orman said. “We’ll be opening more slots, but we’re also giving them at all the testing sites. We’re encouraging people to just walk up to the testing sites to get their flu shot [there].” 
All students, faculty and staff must submit proof of their flu vaccinations to the MySHR portal by Nov. 1.

During the Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday, senators discussed mental health initiatives and updates to a textbook aide program. 
Wellness affairs chairperson and senator David Atash presented updates to his projects, including Counselors Not Cops, a cross-committee project with the external affairs committee that is part of a group of projects designed to reform the Department of Public Safety. 
“At the moment, we’re exploring ways to have either DPS officers include training on crisis management and crisis aversion,” Atash said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’re also exploring options of possibly what it would take to hire additional crisis counselors in conjunction with DPS on calls.”
Atash also works on a project titled Mental Health Gatekeeper trainings, which partners with student organizations to test and measure the outcomes of suicide prevention gatekeeper training. The project aims to act as a pilot for a more encompassing training program for students, faculty and staff.
“[It’s] so that we can present it to administration and advocate for broader wellness and mental health,” Atash said. “As more or less like tools within their toolkit.”
Academic affairs chairperson Annie Nguyen presented her project updates, including an initiative that would create ways for students to finance credited unpaid internships. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Nguyen said all USC students are required by federal law to take credit hours for unpaid internships but not all of them can afford it, which can prevent them from reporting their work. 
“[We’re] setting up a framework that addresses the larger kind of inaccessibility of the idea of unpaid internships, which obviously is less so on the academic credit side and more so on the corporate labor practices that we have as a society,” Nguyen said. 
Nguyen also takes part in the Textbook Exchange Project, a program designed to alleviate inequities in students’ access to course materials. The project recently incorporated the academic affairs committee, the affordability and basic needs committee and chief diversity officer Kavita Rai. 
“For a lot of low-income students or students who are struggling, it’s a lot to drop a few hundred dollars on a textbook,” said Hunter Hinson, a senator with the affordability and basic needs committee, in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
The project initially strived to create an exchange network where students can list their textbooks on a database after they’re done with a course to facilitate exchanges. However, Nguyen said the project ran into issues with physical storage as the increasing number of books in circulation have reduced the amount of space available in libraries. The project also aims to reduce the financial burden course materials can impose on students by covering a portion of the cost.
Despite the logistic issues, Nguyen said she’s satisfied with the project’s progress and hopes to maintain transparency with the student body. 
“There will be people who will always be buying textbooks and can’t find those textbooks that are already in circulation, and, if that is the case, then we want to make sure that price isn’t a financial barrier to either taking the class or succeeding in the class,” Nguyen said.

Men’s basketball team will play its first game of the season Nov. 9 against California State University, Northridge. This will mark the inaugural game for a multitude of new players, many of whom are expected to thrive in their time at USC. 
The teams’ veterans have taken notice of the high skill level of the new additions, praise was given out to Memphis transfer Rejean “Boogie” Ellis by junior guard Ethan Anderson, in an interview with the Daily Trojan.  
“We have a lot of talent out here from Boogie Ellis, he can really score the ball,” Anderson said. “[He] plays defense with high intensity and high energy that can really help us.” 
The Memphis guard spent last season with the Tigers and increased his role throughout the year, beginning the season as a bench player. Eventually, Ellis propelled himself into a key role, helping lead Memphis to a National Invitation Tournament championship, scoring 23 points with 4 three-pointers in the championship game against Mississippi State.  
“I have a lot of individual goals: Just to dominate, be one of the best players in the Pac-12 and to help my team win,” Ellis said. “I’m here to be a leader [and] to] have great communication. I bring a lot of scoring to the table too.” 
Although Ellis is a transfer and has not been with the team for long, Ellis said he feels as though he has found himself in a good situation and is getting along well with the other players on the team. 
“I’m glad to be here,” Ellis said. “I’m really excited for this season, I feel like it’s really home. I’ve been meshing pretty [well], and we’ve been playing really well together.” 
Freshmen guard Malik Thomas and forward Kobe Johnson garnered attention during practices as well. 
Thomas, a guard from Fontana, California, was the 2020-2021 California High School Boys Gatorade Player of the Year. Johnson is a versatile forward from Milwaukee, Wisconsin who averaged 26.7 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 2.4 steals his senior year. 
“Malik [Thomas] and Kobe Johnson really surprised me,” Anderson said. “Malik makes a lot of tough shots, he’s very skilled offensively. Kobe’s IQ is really high, and he shoots really well.”
Another freshman, forward Harrison Hornery, has gotten noticed for his clever play. Hornery is originally from Australia, however he came to the United States to play for Mater Dei High School. Hornery lived with a host family during that time and did not see his family for nearly 15 months due to the coronavirus. Regardless, he still managed to lead Mater Dei in scoring and three pointers. 
“Harry is really intelligent, he’s one of the [smartest] guys we have out here,” Anderson said. “All these [freshmen] in the future are gonna be really great, and this year I feel like they can all help us.” 
Despite losing two key players from last year in forward Evan Mobley and guard Tahj Eaddy, Head Coach Andy Enfield believes the team’s depth will help replace its losses, much of which comes from the newly added players. 
“Evan averaged 17 points and Tahj 13.5 points, so we have about 30 points to replace and quite a few rebounds, blocked shots and assists,” Enfield said. “Our team understands that they have an opportunity to have bigger roles and some players that just joined our team will have a chance to contribute as well.” 
After their Elite Eight run last year, the Trojans hope to build on that success. The energy in practice is high, and Anderson believes if everyone performs to their potential, they will have another great season.
“I feel like [the new players] will all have a great season,” Anderson said. “We have all seen great practices from each and every one of them. I love that they ask me questions about what to do which means they’re willing to learn. We got a really great group and the coaches did a great job recruiting.” 
Above all else, Enfield stresses the importance of playing as a team and that no player is more important than another. He feels the new players should be immediately molded in the team’s mentality.
“We have probably our deepest team we’ve had here in the last few years because we have 13 scholarship players and all of them could contribute this year,’ Enfield said. “We feel great about the depth of this team, and it’ll be a team effort whether we win or lose.”

Beginning July 1, student-athletes began making money from selling their name, image and likeness, more formally known as NIL. This trend came from various decisions made by state laws, federal courts and the NCAA finally allowing players to start earning from the sport they play at the collegiate level.
Clearly, this is great for student-athletes because they dedicate so much committment toward their sport, which also takes away from classes, other activities and even their own free time. 
Even though critics still argue that student-athlete scholarships already act as a form of payment, that isn’t necessarily the case. Scholarships do not usually cover all of the student-athletes expenses and not every single person on the team is receiving full-tuition scholarships or even a scholarship in the first place. 
Being able to sell their “brand” can allow student-athletes to have actual monetary gains from the work they put in daily.
However, what decides how much student-athletes get paid? From my perspective, two major stakeholders are going to pay these student-athletes — major national companies or the local businesses close to the university. 
Obviously, the big-time highly-recruited players are going to be the ones mainly getting major deals with big companies, similar to the stars in professional sports. An example of this can be seen in USC football freshman cornerback Ceyair Wright, who starred in “Space Jam: A New Legacy” alongside LeBron James, who signed a deal with Overtime, a national sports network. 
Others who are not a big name player and/or not at a major university for their sport will likely pursue deals with more local businesses because they are more popular near their college compared to the whole nation. 
An example of this is Iowa basketball player Jordan Bohannon, who made an NIL deal with a local company in the state, Boomin Iowa Fireworks. The offensive line at Arkansas partnered with a local barbeque restaurant.
Colleges located in areas with businesses that have a lot of money for marketing will be appealing to athletes. This leads to my point that location is going to matter much more when it comes to recruiting, so these student-athletes can get much better deals and opportunities for financial compensation. 
Let’s take USC for example, located in one of the largest cities in the country — Los Angeles — with a vibrant array of businesses that want to partner with athletes. Compared to colleges with more traditional settings, such as a small suburban or rural community with not many businesses around, the preference of the student-athlete likely gets more swayed toward USC, even if we might not be better than the other college at whatever sport the athlete plays. 
Still, student-athletes would still be persuaded to go to the current major powerhouses such as Alabama or Clemson for football, even though they are not located in areas as economically fruitful as L.A. 
This is because national brands know the quality of players at such schools, so these companies will put a higher priority on players at these schools. Essentially, it is somewhat like a positive feedback loop where players continue to go to the powerhouse schools regardless of their location. 
Then, student-athletes who stick to traditional powerhouses in small markets are likely to get a major national deal and companies will continue to give such NIL deals because they know the high quality and popularity of players going there. 
Right now, since these NIL decisions happened recently, it is somewhat like the Wild West with limited rules or regulations. I do expect there will be some provisions in the future determining how student-athletes can be compensated and what types of companies they can partner with. 
Regardless, it is imperative USC takes action with these recent changes because its location and brand will attract a lot of businesses to sign deals with its athletes. 
Moreover, with the amount of sports merchandise USC sells throughout the nation, recruits will want to have a portion of the profits. The University is already taking the right steps to build on its student-athletes’ brand, including the football team is partnership with the creative agency J1S to create BLVD Studios to boost its players’ profitability and market value. 
NIL deals could have a major impact on recruiting for schools such as USC who are located in major media markets and highly-populated cities, and these transactions can improve their success on the field in due time.

For both cultural reasons  — as a Black woman — and financial reasons — my unfortunate lack of a Cartier bracelet — I always knew Greek life was not for me. Still, my freshman year self, stuck in a sea of fellow SCA-adjacent Annenberg majors, yearned for a micro-community.
The logical conclusion, in my mind, was joining a professional fraternity — USC’s cinema fraternity, Delta Kappa Alpha. I toyed with the idea, oscillating between enthusiastically attending recruitment events and resigning myself to the life of a lonely drifter after the cost of dues scared me off. 
After spending a few never-ending weeks schmoozing with USC’s quirkiest students, I received my decision via a telephone call while watching “Bad Girls Club” in a Birnkrant lounge. 
A familiar voice notified me of my acceptance and I feigned enthusiasm while burying my mixed feelings; mixed because I was happy that all of the time spent putting off French homework didn’t go to waste and nervous because I now had to figure out how to afford dues. I had zero thoughts on the organization itself.
My feelings then should have been more expansive because I spent the rest of that semester in an externally-induced state of myopia. On initiation night, I marched down West Jefferson with my fellow pledges, running into an acquaintance — one of those girls I faintly remembered from Welcome Week because I liked her lip gloss and she loved my hair so, of course, we had to form a thriving Instagram-mutual-ship. Unlike our usual encounters, her first words weren’t a high-pitched “Hi. How’ve you been!” Instead, she asked me why I was standing in a herd of people wearing berets.
For the first time, I had become aware, and then ashamed of the cringefest she was perceiving. Still, committed to the organization and “family” I had just joined thirty minutes prior, I gave her a childishly dismissive line.
“It’s a secret,” I said before continuing the march down Jefferson. I was fully converted.
I spent the following month or so mindlessly following orders. I wore and re-wore my beret which, consequently, became an itchy mess. I used my meal plan’s guest passes on seasoned DKA members during “activities” — outings they required me to facilitate as a pledge.  
I participated in a forced trauma dump with people who were strangers to me the week before. Given a 24-hour turnaround time, I stayed up until 5 a.m. making a film that tortured me more than anything else — one thing it definitely did not do was develop my cinematic capacities. DKA enforced all of these activities, and more, under the guise of upholding “professionalism.”
The defense for these standards of professionalism, hierarchy and secrecy? Others before me embraced them and went through the process, so my class had to as well. 
After a long-winded conflict — which I don’t care to share on the internet — and several aggressive texts delivered to my phone, I chose to advocate for myself and remind my pledge leader I was a fellow student and not, in fact, a puppet. I then vividly remember the then-vice president chastising me during a “mediation” meeting, where she noted my place in this manufactured hierarchy was bottom of the barrel.
Even as a naive freshman, I was perplexed that a so-called “progressive” organization couldn’t see the issue in weaponizing professionalism. Obviously, I understood I was joining a professional fraternity, but I assumed it was professional in the, “adding each other on LinkedIn and reading each other’s screenplay” way and less in the, “reinforcing a hierarchy and all the biases that come with it” way. 
I shouldn’t have been surprised, as DKA was founded by 10 white men in 1936 — a fact I still remember from one of my pledge quizzes. I must admit though: The demographics of the club look much different now.
“On our board, last year, both our president and vice president were non-binary people of color,” said Bebe Katsenes, a DKA general member. “And most of our [executive board] are people of color or members of the LGBTQIA [community].”
Katsenes values the fraternity’s professional emphasis because of its national reach and ability to provide students with reliable collaborators. While she also believes this historically “exclusionary” space can be reclaimed with the help of constant “self-evaluation” and critique, my and others’ experiences point toward an issue running much deeper.
A post on the @black_at_usc Instagram page highlights these structurally supported biases.
“Last semester DKA voted to reject one of our most impressive, thoughtful applicants, and the main reason people said no to her was because she was “unprofessional” (and yes she was Black),” said an anonymous member of DKA on the page. “Other non-Black applicants who were far more unprofessional [in my opinion] got in that semester.”
While it’s wonderful to think that populating previously white-male-dominated professional fraternities with marginalized people will rid an organization of its most problematic tendencies, the core values of professionalism are inherently racist, sexist and every other -ist.
These values manufacture the power hierarchies that pushed me to drop out of DKA during my freshman year. It’s one thing to have every arena of ones’ life invaded while being paid six figures in corporate America; it’s entirely different, and a bit of a mind-fuck, when the takeover is instead being directed by some flop SDA student who was just partying with you the night before. These blurred lines give professional fraternities a scarily harmful quality.
I refused to join Greek life because I refused to be dehumanized, but I definitely can’t say I felt entirely human in my professional fraternity either. The same harmful impacts of Greek life can be found in professional fraternities, packaged within professional culture and presented to unsuspecting students who aren’t aware of what they’re in for. That, I believe, is easily as sinister as the presence of the Row.

Transfer students come from all walks of life; from the 21-year-old who previously attended a two-year community college to the navy officer returning to university, USC acceptance is a gateway to the best in higher education. 
Whether they transfer because of a shift in educational goals, dissatisfaction with their original institution or changes in life situations, most transfer students find that changing schools gives them a newfound opportunity to lead their most fulfilling lives.
Transfer students should not be treated differently from first-year students: They deserve the same opportunities to access and affordability. When it comes to paying for college, merit-based aid helps close the gap between the cost of attendance and need-based financial aid, especially for families who don’t qualify for financial aid. 
Changing colleges is difficult, and transfer students often receive the short end of the stick. The average transfer student loses 43% of their credits, which is equivalent to a semester’s worth of work for some institutions, and often results in a delayed path to a degree. While credits do not transfer for varying reasons, from mismatches in the curricula to poor class choices guided by inferior advising, transfer students should not be forced to suffer — with no alternative — the costly price tag that comes with graduating late.
The pandemic makes it all the more difficult for transfer students to find their community on campus. The average transfer student who matriculated in Fall 2020 spent a year online and likely two previous years at a community college; yet, this is their first in-person semester at USC — their first in-person experience at a four-year university — as a senior. 
Additionally, transfer students cannot get on-campus housing because USC only guarantees on-campus housing to first- and second- year students. While there are spots open in the USC Village apartments, Cardinal Gardens, and Century, these communities are generally less social, which limits transfer students’ opportunities to become one with the Trojan family.
Unlike most elite private universities who accept only 2% of transfer students per year, USC accepts about 24% of transfer students per year. Transfer students at USC make up almost one-third of its annual new undergraduates, an exceptionally salient community that brings diversity and talent to a predominantly white and privileged campus. 
It is extremely competitive to receive merit-based aid at USC, especially as a transfer student. The largest and only merit opportunity for transfer students is the Transfer Merit Scholarship, which awards one-quarter tuition to approximately 40 students from the applicant pool. Transfer students are not eligible for larger scholarships, as there is no transfer equivalent of the Trustee and Presidential scholarships, which are full and half tuition, respectively.
Because it offers full, half and quarter tuition scholarships exclusively to first-year students compared to a single merit scholarship exclusive to transfer students, USC needs to offer more merit scholarships exclusive to incoming transfer students. International transfer students who are not eligible to receive federal or USC need-based aid could especially benefit.
Beginning in Fall 2020, the University installed the new USC Affordability Initiative to guarantee a tuition-free education to first-year students whose families make $80,000 or less a year with typical assets. Home ownership is not counted in the financial aid calculations. For the 2021-22 school year, USC raised its tuition by 2%. With rising tuition rates, it is even more urgent that USC install the same Affordability Initiative for transfer students.
If USC continues to limit its Affordability Initiative to first-year students, it can at least offer more merit scholarships exclusive to transfer students and raise awareness of these merit award opportunities. 
The disconnect between transfer students and non-transfer students is evident, especially as we emerge from the pandemic bubble. Moving forward, the Transfer Student Assembly at USC should prioritize publicizing merit award opportunities on their website for transfer students. 
USC prides itself on investing in its student body’s talent and diversity. However, its treatment of the transfer community says otherwise. Transfer students’ invisibility is evident in the lack of merit scholarship opportunities, which warrants USC reforming its financial aid and academic scholarship committees to ensure that every transfer student can affordably attend USC.

As autumn sends Los Angeles its first gentle breeze of October, Halloween is right around the corner. To uncover the mysteries of society’s fascination with Halloween, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences held a Zoom panel Monday to discuss the appeal of the holiday, and the relationship between ghosts and humans.
The event, introduced by Dornsife Dean Amber Miller was moderated by Lisa Bitel, Dean’s professor of religion and history. Guest panelists included Tok Thompson, professor of anthropology, and Leo Braudy, professor of English, art history and history and the Leo S. Bing Chair in English and American literature.
Bitel opened the event by explaining the festival of Samhain in the Celtic culture. Samhain takes place on Nov. 1, with Oct. 31 being Samhain’s eve. In Irish mythology,  Samhain’s eve is the time when ghosts and demons tread on earth, characteristics that influence modern Halloween.
 “Samhain, the day that for thousands of years has been celebrated as the beginning of winter and the beginning of [a] time [of] darkness and a time when the crevices between our world and another world open,” Bitel said. “Not always to allow the dead and living to mix, but sometimes to allow all kinds of beings to mix with others.”
The frightfulness of Halloween is not only evident in its origins but also by people’s fear of the supernatural, Braudy said. The desire to understand life and death is often what brings ghosts to people’s attention. Analyzing this phenomenon, Braudy said religion plays a significant part by attempting to address the boundaries between life and death and the uncertainties of that relationship. 
This gives people a sense of “what it is like to be alive or somehow have relationships with those who are dead,” Braudy said.
Thompson added that people’s perceptions of ghosts also vary across cultures. In some cultures, people do not believe in ghosts at all, while in other cultures, people describe ghosts in many different ways. 
“The way that the afterlife is thought of, or souls are thought of, or the cosmos and our relation to it is thought of is wonderfully, wonderfully diverse,” Thompson said. 
Thompson described how when considering ghosts, people often connect them with those who have been mistreated. He continued to explain that there is always immorality related to the presence of haunting ghosts, which implies people can get haunted by ethical failures. However, ghosts are only one part of the moral issues related to Halloween. Braudy said other stories of supernatural beings, both on earth and extraterrestrial, are associated with morals. 
“They are all very much about our fears and our hopes, and the clash between the two of them,” Braudy said.
In many generational horrors, there have been some common themes, such as history and social ills, that lead to the discussion of morals. Thompson talked about how American ghost stories that take place on Native American burial grounds reflect and tell a societal history of those who have been wronged. 
For Braudy, the themes may also reveal what is repressed in society. The horror  element of these stories serves as the psychotherapy that forces American culture to face its own ills. Just as the problems in many ghost stories can be eventually resolved, the panelists agreed that the way to solve what haunts society is to right the wrongs.
The modern depiction of ghosts, supernatural creatures and their stories is not solely in books and conversations. Panelists described their presency through various types of new technologies, such as AIs, films and stop-motion photography. According to the panelists, the new technologies can help people see things that appear to be “supernatural” and even reconnect with their deceased loved ones. Technology does not develop new types of horror: It only reflects the ones that already exist. 
“You can’t just make stuff up,” Thompson said. “You can’t have ghosts act in a completely different way or people won’t buy it. That’s not right. That’s not how they act. There [are] limits to the tradition. There’s agency within the limits but limits within the tradition.” 
The guest speakers also discussed the future for ghosts and monsters and what people may feel haunted by in the coming years. Braudy indicated that, contrary to the past, the most preoccupied creatures at the moment are zombies. This is because people shifted from fearing single monsters to fearing groups of monsters. This reflects people’s potential fear of the masses in the future. Thompson added that xenophobia and racism also instigated this fear. 
“This sort of the idea of xenophobia, [is] that there are always the other and they’re not really people, so it’s okay to kill them because they’re not really people. All they want to do is take us over, [and] take our brains over,” Thompson said.
Near the end of the panel, the professors recommended books for audience members interested in learning more about horror and supernaturals. Thompson introduced “Ghosts and the Japanese” by Michiko Iwasaka and Barre Toelken and “Shakespeare in the Bush” by Laura Bohannan. Braudy presented his book “Haunted: On Ghosts, Witches, Vampires, Zombies, and Other Monsters of the Natural and Supernatural Worlds.” 
“The basic argument [in the book] is: Which religion has a better relationship to the spirit world?” Braudy said. “Which religion knows what god is really doing? So that conflict yields all sorts of the ghosts and gives it a quantum push forward.”

If you’re looking for a colorful beaded necklace or a personalized shoe chain, Broke Bish Beadz has what you’re searching for. Maddie Langford, a junior majoring in business administration, started her beaded jewelry business Broke Bish Beadz in April and has since achieved great success.
During quarantine, Martha Calvo necklaces were popularized by fashion influencers such as Suede Brooks and Victoria Paris; however, these necklaces run for several hundred dollars. Determined to have her own, Langford went to Michael’s and bought $70 worth of supplies. After making her own, she offered to make some for her friends.
“​​I spent about $70 buying the beads, so I wanted to sell them to my friends to break even,” Langford said. “That’s when I started selling them. But then it obviously turned out to be a lot more than that.” 
Soon after, Langford started her company’s Instagram account, @brokebishbeadz. It started out filled with memes and funny posts, but as the page grew in popularity and more people wanted to order her products, she realized it could be something bigger. 
When Langford first sold the necklaces, her customer base comprised of largely other USC students or friends. Once she used social media and grew her brand, her customer base expanded exponentially to the point where she now ships worldwide.
Langford prioritizes branding her jewelry in an effort to make it both unique and competitive in the jewelry market. Her marketing reflects her carefree persona and gives the brand a separate personality, Langford said.
“I think the people that purchase [my jewelry] are people that I would be friends with in real life because they follow my account and because there’s tons of Instagrams for beaded necklaces, but I think the marketing and branding of mine makes it different,” Langford said.
Mehak Chhabra, a junior majoring in business administration, has been friends with Langford since freshman year and the two later became roommates. Chhabra witnessed her roommate’s business evolution since the beginning. 
“I remember waking up to the sound of beads rustling. It was always great to know how much fun she had doing it and how much she really enjoyed it,” Chhabra said. “She has a really good relationship with all her customers and cares about every necklace looking the best.” 
To continue growing Broke Bish Beadz, Langford prioritized developing her brand and marketing. 
“I wanted to be unique and funny, and also relatable,” Langford said. “So I made it more like a persona or a character than an actual business.”
Langford types all of her captions in a particular style  to create a sense of consistency within her brand, using phrases such as “baddies,” “queens” and “besties”. Langford uses everything Instagram offers — from captions to story polls and Q&As — to learn from her customers and create products targeted toward her consumer base.
“I also think posting pictures or reposting pictures that [customers] would send me of them wearing necklaces made them feel part of the brand, which [builds] loyalty and trust with them,” Langford said.
Courtney Woloson, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, purchases jewelry from Broke Bish Beadz.
“The online social media presence of Broke Bish Beadz is one of the key factors that drew me in as a consumer,” Woloson said. “The founder’s personality is very much present in the social media activity, which really fosters a relationship between the company and the consumer. It feels like interacting with one of your peers, rather than a business owner.”
Langford even had a booth at Row Rave, a USC student-run music event, where she shared her work with a huge group of students. Despite immense success, Langford faced challenges running a small business while being a full-time student.
Originally, Langford found taking more than 100 orders through Instagram to be rather time consuming. Due to the overwhelming interest, Langford created a fully functioning website to make the demand more manageable. Although it helped make the process more efficient, handmaking all her jewelry by herself still consumes much of her time.
“The biggest challenges I’ve faced were really trying to balance it with school and my internship. It was super stressful when I’d have over 100 orders to fill, but then I’d have to study for finals or want to hang out with friends,” Langford said. 
Although time-management is difficult, Langford has learned a lot from her entrepreneurship and perfected her process. Moving forward, Langford hopes to trademark her company and further expand it. Yet to decide her exact plans, Langford wants to continue with the company. The experience has taught Langford a lot about the realities of running a small business and the importance of following one’s passion.
“I thought I wanted to go into investment banking or consulting,” Langford said. “But now I realized that I want to do something creative. Even if you don’t think you can at first, being successful is more about doing something that you’re passionate about.”
