As far as my personal rooting interests are concerned, Super Bowl LIV is a lose-lose. 
I’m an Eagles fan. Wait, no, that was a bad first impression. Let me explain. I’m not “one of those” Eagles fans: I don’t punch horses, I have never thrown batteries at people and I do not shout vulgarities at 99-year-old Minnesota Vikings fans. I have booed Santa Clause, but that’s because he’s a fraud.
I’m a good Eagles fan, specifically one that used to fantasize about going cheeseburger-for-cheeseburger with Andy Reid. At face value, I want that man to get his much-deserved championship — one that he may or may not have been cheated out of by a certain spying team in 2005 — even if it’s with the Kansas City Chiefs and not my Eagles.
In addition, I hail from the Bay Area, which means I’ve spent 20 years living alongside San Francisco sports fans. Let me tell you, many of them — the majority — are, in the most respectful way, often difficult to put up with (that’s for another column, just take my word for now). Seriously, stop saying Jimmy Garropolo is good. The reason he’s the face of the franchise is literally that: his face. (Don’t lie to yourself, he’s a good looking dude.) In that respect, anything that brings down the collective ego of San Francisco sports fans, I’m all for. 
I wish it was that simple. Unfortunately, it’s not. Because I can’t root for a team whose fans constantly appropriate Native American cultures and collectively do the tomahawk chop at home games. 
The Chiefs are the Washington Redskins but a little bit better. The latter’s offenses are one of the most hotly debated topics in the world of sports — for obvious, justified reasons — but somehow, the Chiefs’ fly relatively under the radar. 
I’ll give the Chiefs some extremely measured level of props — unlike the Redskins, their team name is not literally a derogatory term used to discriminate against Native American people. For that, I applaud them — I guess.
But what their fans do is pretty much the same, or at least, not far from it. They show up in droves to Arrowhead Stadium wearing headdresses, feathers, war paint — the whole nine yards. They do their tomahawk chop with the same chant used by the Florida State Seminoles and Atlanta Braves, two other sports teams that should really rethink things. 
Of course, none of these organizations or schools have anything to do with Native American communities; they do very little or nothing for them and surely neglect to sufficiently weigh the objections of Native American people who rightfully claim that this sort of practice is out of line. 
I will praise the Chiefs — or, rather, berate them less. Supposedly, as of 2017, the team had asked broadcasters not to show fans dressed in Native American-themed costumes — but they still don’t have the nerve to ban such images at their stadium outright. Translation: ‘Don’t expose the fact that we’re borderline racist, but we’re not going to stop doing it because it helps us win games.’ Arrowhead Stadium is one of the loudest venues in the NFL and has even reached world record decibel levels for a sports crowd. Correct me if I’m wrong, but some decency in the clothing realm shouldn’t obstruct the sound waves too much.
There’s another layer to this. Wouldn’t it feel wrong if — on the day that arguably screams “American” more than any other day on the calendar — the team that stood atop the mountain of America’s most American sports league was one that essentially mocks the cultures of the first real Americans?
I want to re-stress that the Chiefs are not the proverbial posterboy of anti-Native American racism in the NFL, nor should they be treated as such. That title is firmly and fittingly secured in a chamber of hell just a few miles from the nation’s capital, guarded by the devil that is Dan Snyder, whose level of awfulness Chiefs owner Clark Hunt has not approached. 
But less wrong, even if significantly less wrong, is wrong nonetheless. 
The Super Bowl is still two days away, so maybe there’s time for me to have a change of heart. Maybe I’ll realize that while the organization and especially the fans are slightly messed up, the players have nothing to do with it and shouldn’t have to pay for it. Maybe I’ll reason that guys like Patrick Mahomes, Damien Williams and Travis Kelce are good guys and — wait, Tyreek Hill is still on the Chiefs?
Nevermind. Quest for Six, baby.

The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team will head to Westwood Saturday for a mini-tournament tilt against No. 16 Loyola Marymount and a scrimmage against host No. 3 UCLA. 
The games were added to the Trojans’ schedule to increase the amount of opportunities the team has to prepare for a trip to the NCAA Tournament. 
On Saturday morning, the Trojans will face a Lions team that outscored opponents Pomona-Pitzer and Chapman 30-12 at the Lancer Joust last weekend, bringing their overall record to 3-1 on the season. Their two-game winning streak is led in part by drivers senior Melyssa Moore and junior Alena Sanchez, who tallied a total of 12 goals in Riverside.
With the season just in its infancy, head coach Marko Pintaric noted that trusting the game plan is the default for any team they face to block scoring drives. 
“We are always in a tradition of trusting our traditional game to initiate everything,” Pintaric said. “We rely on scouting reports as well. We had a chance to see Loyola play in the last tournament and again before ours, so [we] know their strengths and weaknesses and we’re going to stick with our game plan.”
On the defensive side, apart from a 21-5 loss to Hawaii and an 8-6 loss against Fresno State, the Lions have kept their opponents to 9 goals and under with a young goalie group of sophomore Elizabeth Bradley and freshmen Madison Davis and Tara Debrabander all clocking in time over four games. 
Regardless of the multiple play styles the three goalies may bring, USC senior driver Denise Mammolito noted the Trojans’ approach to facing multiple goalies is to prepare and adapt as needed.
“I think for any goalie you want to read and just execute,” Mammolito said. “I’m sure the coaches will scout them and we’ll know their weaknesses. So we’ll be ready to go regardless of who’s in the cage with them.”
Last season, the Trojans faced the Lions in the 2019 Triton Invitational in February and emerged with a win that handed them their sixth straight tournament title. The 16-5 win showcased the depth of the Trojans’ roster with 10 different players adding to the score sheet, a pattern expected to reemerge in this year’s match.  
A scrimmage with UCLA will round out the Trojans’ appearance at the tournament against a Bruins team that has already played nine games on the season. The match will be a key opportunity to scope out some of the Bruins’ top scorers including freshman utility Abbi Hill, whose early 24 goals on the season is at least twice that of every other player on the roster. The two teams will possibly square off at the Triton Invitational next weekend and later in the season in April. 
“The scrimmages are great — invaluable — because we can play everybody, pretty much,” Pintaric said. “It’s just to see how we match up with them and how they match up, obviously, with us. This is going to be a great training for both teams.”
The Trojans will face the Lions at 12:45 p.m. and scrimmage against UCLA at 5:15 p.m. Saturday in Westwood.

After an extremely difficult week for the basketball community, USC honored NBA legend Kobe Bryant’s legacy in Los Angeles with a 56-52 win over Utah Thursday at Galen Center.
It was the team’s first game since the tragic passing of Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others in a helicopter accident Sunday.
Players and students alike donned Kobe shirts as the arena engaged in a 24.8-second moment of silence to honor the nine lives lost.
“I always respected Kobe’s game,” senior forward Nick Rakocevic said. “The biggest thing was everything he did off the court … Tonight was for him. I’m glad we won for him.”
The Trojans struggled to get going, missing shot after shot in the first half. Senior guard Jonah Mathews, who averaged 16.6 points through the previous three games, was held scoreless on five attempts. The team consistently misfired from 3-point range, going 1-for-8 in the half.
Despite USC’s offensive woes, the team kept itself within striking distance largely thanks to Rakocevic, who had 12 points and five boards through the first 20 minutes. The big man finished with 16 points and 15 rebounds, marking his seventh double-double this season.
“At the beginning of the game, when I noticed we were flat and we came off to a rough start, I thought, ‘I gotta get things going for my team,’” Rakocevic said. “So I feel like right after I hit the first three, it just kind of opened up my game a little bit more.”
The teams played different styles of offense throughout the night. The Utes relied on their starters for a collective effort — four starters scored 10-plus points, while their bench contributed just 2.
For the Trojans, it was sophomore guard Elijah Weaver’s play off the bench that made a difference in the second half. Weaver had 10 points after halftime, including two clutch 3-pointers that brought the energy up in Galen Center.
“Just be aggressive,” Weaver said of his mindset entering the game. “I think that’s my new role. We’ve been talking about sixth-man stuff, just coming off the bench and bringing energy. That’s all it was, just energy and confidence.”
Many of USC’s recent games have gone down to the wire, and this outing was no different. Utah had the ball down 2 points with 20 seconds to go, and it looked like the game could see overtime.
However, freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu — who had been fairly silent with just 8 points from the field — blocked a potential game-tying shot with six seconds left, drew a foul and nailed both free throws to seal the deal for USC.
The Trojans’ defense frustrated Utah’s shooters, who shot just 18-for-55 on the night.
“It’s a tough one to swallow for sure,” Utah head coach Larry Krystkowiak said of the loss. “We didn’t make enough shots.”
USC head coach Andy Enfield said he is pleased with the way his team has played defense against tough opponents, allowing them to win tight battles.
“We’ve got a lot of close games,” Enfield said. “Those are all really good basketball teams, and we’re 4-1 in those games. It’s a credit to our players — we defend and we get some stops.”
With the win, USC moves to 17-4, already surpassing its 16 total wins last season. The Trojans also boast a 6-2 record in conference play, putting them at second in the Pac-12 behind Oregon. 
The team will take on No. 4 Colorado Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Galen Center. The Buffaloes will look to get back on track after a Thursday upset loss at UCLA.

Floral print, electric rainbow wigs, neon lights and flowing pink dresses decorate the backdrop of Emerald Fennell’s Sundance project “Promising Young Woman.” At the center of this world is Cassie (Carey Mulligan), a 30-year-old living at home with her parents and who has more than a few skeletons in her closet. She keeps track, actually. 
Cassie’s hobby is going to clubs, acting like she’s so plastered she can’t remember her own name, and as soon as a “nice guy” tries to take advantage of her under the guise of “helping out,” snapping back into her sober demeanor and, well, teaching him a lesson. We’re not sure exactly what happens, but when we cut to her later making another tally in her notebook, we can only assume she’s done whatever she has set out to, and it likely wasn’t pretty. 
The story is scandalizing, and Cassie, often clad in pastel colors with her blonde hair in braids, is the most unexpected threat to these men. She is a modern vigilante, a woman boiling with anger and grief. We don’t immediately know what haunts her, but we know it has to do with her friend Nina, and we know it’s the reason she dropped out of medical school years ago. The audience can only assume it’s the reason she does what she does in the direct way that she does it.
Fennell has given us a protagonist we can’t help but root for, despite her flaws. Cassie is stubborn and rude, but she is traumatized. And her rage can resonate with so many women. Her master plan to dismantle an abusive patriarchal system one man at a time seems ridiculous, yet one can’t help but want to aid her endeavors. Or, at least, cheer her on every time she successfully tricks a “nice guy” into admitting he’s a fully fledged asshole. It’s a win when she gets them to confront their own malice and cruelty — men who are so clearly infuriated that they’ve been seen through and some of whom seem like they truly believe they are “nice.” It shatters their world and breaks down societal ideals of masculinity. 
Mulligan delivers every line with an acidic undertone and backs down from no man. Her performance is captivating and does not let the audience forget that at the heart of it all, Cassie is a woman scorned. Her agenda is the result of pain, helplessness and sheer frustration with a system that does everything but protect her and her fellow women. And that crushing paralysis is something that every woman has felt at some point or another. 
Supporting actor Bo Burnham also plays a significant role as the love interest that slowly melts her ice-cold exterior. Ryan (Burnham), a former medical school classmate, is a “nice guy” who  actually is a really nice guy. He plays the character with that classic Burnham dorky awkwardness, and he clearly wants to take the time to get to know Cassie. He is honest and persistent without being pushy. But Cassie takes her time letting her walls down. 
It’s a bit of a slow burn, but would you expect anything less from a woman who spends her nights targeting so-called “nice guys?” She’s seen the worst of them, and she knows the act only goes on for so long. 
Fennell’s directorial debut solidifies her as a promising young woman herself. Previously the showrunner for “Killing Eve,” this is her first writer-director credit. Fennell has had various acting roles (you might recognize her as Camilla Shand on “The Crown” or Elsa in “The Danish Girl”), but “Promising Young Woman” is very much the project that is going to put her name on the map. 
The film is an ambitious undertaking, and she occasionally struggles with tonal consistency: Sometimes you’re not sure whether you’re watching a romantic comedy or a violent revenge story. But nevertheless, the audience grows used to it and doesn’t feel like they’re settling or being forced to. It’s just the nature of this world, which ultimately is just the reality of womanhood. A sugary romance with a kind and loving boyfriend does not negate the constant fear of the malevolence of men and the cruelty of the patriarchy. Cassie is not a tough girl like we’re used to. She does not carry a gun and strut around in leather and chunky boots. She does not shy away from her femininity. 
The bubblegum aesthetic of the film is vital and has a clear message: Anger is not only reserved for the least feminine woman. Cassie is every girl and any girl. She is a badass who  makes it her personal mission to discipline potential rapists, and she is the romantic that dances around a pharmacy to a Paris Hilton song. 
“Promising Young Woman” is all about reclaiming. We should not have to strip ourselves of our femininity to be taken seriously. It implies that oppression and abuse are simply ingrained into  gender, as if it is to be expected. Women should have our cake and feel safe eating it too. We should be allowed to be women on our own terms. And if those terms include a vendetta against disgusting predators, then so be it. I’m team Cassie.

“The Bachelor” is one of the most frustrating shows I’ve ever watched. It is just four episodes in with 15 women remaining, but Peter Weber’s season has already reached a state of disarray as, in the words of contestant Tammy, “drama has risen from the dead.”
However, that is exactly what America wants to see in reality TV, and so far, this season has delivered like no other. 
The season premiere started out with a bang as Hannah Brown, who was on the previous  season of “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette,” made a surprise appearance. She quickly faded from the limelight as contestant Hannah Ann took over the first night with an extremely aggressive strategy, stealing Peter three times to earn the First Impression Rose. 
In the second episode, Hannah Ann and contestant Kelsey started beef after Kelsey accused Hannah Ann of stealing the champagne that she had been saving for Peter. Their showdown was exciting as both felt they were in the right, but their squabble does not compare to what would happen in the next episode.
That drama started after contestant Sydney and others accused contestant Alayah of being on the show solely for the fame and money rather than for Peter. Alayah was then exposed for convincing contestant Victoria P. to lie to producers to get on the show and her chances of marrying Peter all but disappeared.
At least that was the case, until Peter decided to bring Alayah back after discovering that Victoria P., who up until that point had been making a strong surge, had also surprisingly lied by denying her obvious friendship with Alayah. Now, Peter has dug himself a huge hole and seemingly has no idea what to do next. 
I get a headache just thinking about all the unnecessary drama and cattiness, yet millions of Americans tune in each week to watch the spectacle unfold. But why? Why do so many people enjoy watching women fight in an ugly, humiliating battle for what is supposed to be “love?” 
I think one of the reasons so many people love “The Bachelor” is because it appeals to a sense of fantasy that most people will never find in their own life.
Take Peter for example: The man is perfect in many ways, from his looks to his character. What woman wouldn’t want to marry such a successful, caring and handsome man? 
The dates that Peter takes the contestants on also exude picture-perfect fantasy. Contestant Victoria F. had an amazing date where she and Peter had a whole amusement park to themselves, followed by a private Chase Rice concert and then a romantic candlelit dinner. “The Bachelor” presents a fairytale setting and American audiences eat it up.
Another reason “The Bachelor” is so popular is because people want to see who is going to win, and the show’s drama adds the perfect touch of uncertainty and excitement that draws audiences in. People make predictions, have arguments and make bets on who they think will come away with a ring. I’m not going to lie — this is the main reason why I keep watching the show. 
This season has been especially intriguing in that regard because Peter and all the women are currently a hot mess, and no one knows what’s going to happen. 
Let’s also not forget that Peter has caused his fair share of problems as well. He has done a number of questionable things, from second-guessing himself with Hannah Brown to asking Alayah back on the show and giving her a date rose for a date she didn’t even go on. 
Despite the show’s toxicity, “The Bachelor” is still wildly popular. Audiences get to witness a fairytale in real life, complete with dream dates in picturesque settings as 30 stunning women contend for the hand of a seemingly perfect man. The drama and romance are never-ending, and at the end of the day, it’s exactly what everyone wants to see.

Writer, curator, influencer and activist Kimberly Drew discussed the importance of Black artists’ representation in the museum world at her Visions and Voices talk on contemporary art and activism Tuesday night.
In 2015, Drew was hired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City as the associate online community producer, before taking on the role of social media manager. She is an advocate for equity, representation and accessibility. 
Drew entered the art scene as an intern at The Studio Museum in Harlem while attending Smith College, where she discovered a poster of artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. On a quest to find more Black artists, Drew said she viewed many of the contemporary artists she encountered as Black versions of the white artists traditionally taught at her university. At the time, Basquiat struck her as “the Black Andy Warhol.”
“I tell that story because … it’s kind of ridiculous that we have to think about there being the Black version of anything,” she said.
After her internship, Drew returned to Smith College and added an art history major (with a museum studies concentration) to her bachelor’s degree in African American studies. Unsatisfied with the lack of diversity of artists discussed in her classes, she struggled to find resources online for Black contemporary art. 
So in 2011, she decided to make her own — a Tumblr blog appropriately  called “Black Contemporary Art.”
“In the same way that I had encountered that image of Warhol and Basquiat, casually, I didn’t want anyone to have to climb over mountains to learn about Black artists,” Drew said.
After graduating, Drew landed jobs at nonprofits, literary magazines and art galleries such as Creative Time, Hyperallergic, The Studio Museum and Lehmann Maupin. It was during this time when she began using Instagram as a platform to invite her community to participate in the museum world. 
“I would visit as many art spaces as I could, do my best to report back and try to show people literally different choreographies of how to engage with art,” Drew said. “[I’d] try to make sure that people knew there were Black artists that were showing downtown … and that you could look like me and be in a gallery.” 
By the time she reached the Met, social media had become an opportunity for her to better illustrate the world of art she loved to those who were marginalized by it.
“What does it mean that this institution that holds 5,000 years of art feels so inaccessible to so many?” Drew said.
During her three-year tenure at the Met, Drew grew the museum’s audience by nearly 6 million followers.
Currently, Drew is lecturing, writing and shining light on underrepresented artists. She has two books set to be released in 2020: “Black Futures,” a visual anthology jointly edited by her and The New York Times culture writer Jenna Wortham, and “This Is What I Know About Art,” a young adult novel. 
“I wanted to make this book so that young people [understand] that they can be a part of the art world,” Drew said.
Despite her success, Drew admits she’s still figuring life out but did not leave the seniors without a word of advice.
“I really think it’s important for any of the students … to understand that there’s so much future and to seize the moments that we have while we have them,” Drew said. 
The event was organized by seniors Jabrea Patterson-West, who is majoring in French and art history, and Julienne Dawidoff, who is majoring in art history. During her freshman year, Dawidoff reached out to Drew through email and was pleasantly surprised when she responded with a recommended list of books.
“Kimberly Drew has been an inspiration of mine for a long time,” Dawidoff said. “I thought that was the most amazing thing.”
Both Dawidoff and Patterson-West spent over a year actively planning the event. Like Drew, both students want to raise awareness about representation and accessibility in art.
“[Underrepresented artists] need to be foregrounded,” Patterson-West said. “Very often they’re an afterthought.” 
Dawidoff said that, as a senior, it was reassuring to hear Drew admit she didn’t have all the answers to her career after graduation. 
“[That] version of me had no idea what was next,” Drew said. “I stand here today because of that person’s courage.”

From spending hours listening to professors drone over syllabuses, to waking up to an alarm for the first time since December, the first week of classes couldn’t end soon enough for USC students. As the weekend inched closer, many Trojans were eager for the opportunity to catch up with friends, grab some food and unwind with a couple of cold drinks. 
Tucked in a quiet corner between USC Village and the Row, Study Hall played host to these types of welcome back gatherings for the better part of the past decade. This weekend, however, the fryers were cold, the kegs stopped flowing and the restaurant’s once animated porches and patios were barren and desolate. One of the area’s few locally owned and operated eateries had shut its doors for good, leaving USC students with no reliable alternative.
Toward the end of last semester, students received the shocking news that one of their favorite haunts would not be crossing into the new decade with them. In the wake of the announcement, droves of loyal patrons piled into the creaky Victorian structure. From freshman newcomers curious to see if the signature mac and cheese was really that good, to seniors who have been regulars for their entire time at USC the Trojan community came together to bid the spot a proper farewell. 
Now, having said their final goodbyes to the beloved hangout, many still struggle to fill the void created by Study Hall’s closure. For many, the restaurant was not just a place to indulge in comfort foods and drinks, but a focal point for the campus community — fostering a number of collegiate friendships and hosting countless more great times. 
“USC has lost a unique place where students of all sorts could come and relax after a really tough day of classes,” said Daniel Hailpern, a sophomore majoring in journalism. “It wasn’t just the food and drinks that made Study Hall special, but the company and the sense of community that the building had. Not a lot of places can really capture that environment. Quite frankly, I don’t know where to go this semester, I don’t have a ‘go-to’ hangout spot anymore.”
Other students share Hailpern’s sense of loss this semester. Emily Dobson, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies, echoed the sentimental value of Study Hall. Like many of her peers, she still looks fondly upon the establishment, in spite of its closure.
“I wish I had gone there more often now that it’s gone,” Dobson said. “I’m honestly really grateful for all of the great times that I had there and all of the memories that I made … I’ll always have those even if I can’t necessarily go back and make new ones.”
For many who are new to campus or those who never really got the hype, Study Hall’s closure is not as poignant as it is for other students. However, the shutdown of this establishment is undoubtedly a loss for the entire USC community. The notion that Study Hall was more than just a restaurant is rooted in much more than its patrons’ personal sentiment. Rather, Study Hall genuinely functioned as a central meeting point. Like Hailpern said, the restaurant allowed students of all walks of life to congregate and talk about all kinds of topics, building important bonds with their friends and classmates that enhance — and to some extent define — the traditional college experience. 
While many college towns boast a surplus of similar establishments, the University Park Campus neighborhood has a relative dearth of small businesses. Void of comparable alternatives, the loss of Study Hall further feeds into the corporatization and gentrification of USC’s surrounding area. Merely a few years after the construction of USC Village brought in such national chains as Wahlburgers and Cava, Study Hall’s absence further hinders the ability for USC students to support local businesses, particularly restaurants. 
Without “mom and pop” establishments like Study Hall in the equation, USC students seem to now be left with few other options but to gather at rather impersonal, cookie-cutter franchises and fast-food joints — if they decide to get together at all. Until somewhere new can capture the light-hearted, cheerful atmosphere of Study Hall, many students’ hearts will be as empty as their stomachs.

The Kaufman School of Dance received a $1 million gift from an anonymous donor earlier this month. The funding will benefit both Kaufman and the Thornton School of Music, increasing collaboration between the two schools.
The schools work together on programs such as the annual Choreographers & Composers Concert and want to use the funds to work on other projects in the future, according to Kaufman Director of Advancement Patrick Leder-Morrow.  
“The Choreographers & Composers Concert — that’s an established collaboration that happens year over year,” Leder-Morrow said. “One thing that’s been sort of in talk about was doing a similar program with popular music in addition to classical music.” 
The donation, which will be paid over a few years, will be added to the University’s endowment fund to generate additional revenue for Kaufman to use for the coming years. 
“Oftentimes when donors make a significant contribution, it’s essentially setting up an endowment fund that might be paid over a few years,” Leder-Morrow said. “We tap into that income to support [school] collaborations but the million dollars stays in the [endowment] fund forever, generating additional revenue for the school to use year after year.” 
Leder-Morrow said the funds will lead to increased collaboration with other schools in terms of artists working together.
“This is really just an opportunity for faculty to dream,” he said. “They can imagine what future collaborations might be.” 
Leder-Morrow said that currently no decision had been made regarding the allocations of the funding, but discussions about utilizing the money have started.
“There’s nothing planned yet,” Leder-Morrow said. “This is all still very new, but I know that conversations are happening among faculty both on the Kaufman side and the Thornton side to figure out the best way to put this new resource to good use.”

Five percent of USC’s endowment funds fossil fuel investments, the Investment Office confirmed to the Daily Trojan Thursday. The release of this information comes days after more than 100 students rallied at Tommy Trojan for further transparency regarding University investments.
At 5%, USC invests $277 million in fossil fuels. Harvard has directed $560 million — 1% of its $39.2 billion endowment — toward fossil fuels, according to information published in May by Divest Harvard. The University of California system has divested from fossil fuel investments from its $13.4 billion endowment,. USC has a $5.5 billion endowment.
The Environmental Student Assembly, which hosted the rally Monday, has been urging the University to disclose this information since mid-October. At the Divest SC rally, ESA co-director Nathaniel Hyman encouraged students to call the Investment Office and push the University to release their numbers. Since then, multiple students have said the Investment Office has disclosed the fossil fuel investment numbers to them. In December, the organization sent a letter to President Carol Folt to request transparency with the proportion of the University’s endowment fund invested in the fossil fuel industry. 
“Endowment spending, which has historically been impervious to inquiry from students, staff, faculty and the public, must also be included in the University’s push towards transparency,” the letter read.
The Office of Sustainability said it was unable to comment on the investment numbers but that it supports both the students advocating for transparency and the University’s endowment spending decisions. 
Hyman also said he hopes that USC will take action to improve the University’s issue with fossil fuel investment 
“We need to make sure that the University is still fulfilling its fiduciary obligation to its workers, to the institution,” he said. “Those are things that we are not trying to contend with. We are trying to make the University money, and we were trying to do it in a way that actually doesn’t kill people.”
Members of ESA and Environmental Core will meet with Folt Friday to discuss the University’s fossil fuel investments. ECore representative Tianna Shaw-Wakeman said her organization is unsure of what the meeting will entail.  
“We have no idea if she already has a divestment plan in place or what her thoughts are,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “Pretty much everything is contingent on tomorrow and what she says. Ideally, she would say that [divestment] is going to happen and it will go perfectly, but we aren’t sure.”
ESA and ECore’s “disclose, divest and reinvest” campaign has worked to convince University officials to direct USC’s endowment toward other energy resources, preferably renewable energy.
“No one has proposed that we divest from the fossil fuel industry and then place that money under a mattress — that would be absurd and horrible for our workers’ pensions,” Hyman said. “[What] we are suggesting is that we take as much funds as we legally can from our fossil fuel investments and put them … preferably in renewables and green technology.”
Hyman said students must use their voices to amplify the need to reduce the University’s fossil fuel investments. 
“Through supporting divestment, your voice is amplified because we are … in a relatively small community with an absolutely absurd carbon footprint,” Hyman said. “Now is your chance to substantially reduce your own personal carbon emissions through using your power as an individual as the University reviews [its power].”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University wrote that Folt is working with the administration to develop a plan to incorporate sustainability in their investments. 
“[Folt] is working closely with the Investment Committee members of the Board of Trustees and the endowment investment staff to balance the need for sustainability and the costs associated with this priority,” the statement read. “In order to establish a fossil fuel divestment policy, the Investment Committee must consider its fiduciary responsibilities to the university and the long-term risks and returns associated with these assets.”
The University said its fossil fuel investments include oil and natural gas exposure that are primarily private market investments in which immediate divestment would result in significant losses.
Correction: The article incorrectly stated that Harvard University has invested $5.6 million in fossil fuels out of a $40.9 billion endowment. The university has invested $560 million from a $39.2 billion endowment. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.
Editor’s note: This article has been updated to include more information about USC’s endowment investments.

When screenwriting majors filed into School of Cinematic Arts classrooms to begin their spring classes, they were greeted by a new policy: Beginning this semester, SCA John Wells Division of Writing for Screen and Television would no longer distinguish between excused and unexcused absences. Instead, all absences would decrease students’ course grades by 10% per absence after the second absence. Two late arrivals also count as one absence per the policy. 
Previously, unexcused absences decreased a grade by half a letter following the second unexcused absence. Excused absences did not affect a student’s grade; however, students had to provide the appropriate documentation for a professor to excuse the absence.
In response to the policy change SCA students drafted an official complaint to the SCA dean and writing vice chair in a petition delivered Jan. 16. 
Junior Gia King also took to social media to voice frustrations with the attendance policy change, she called on students to sign the petition which she contributed to. 
In the letter, students including King and senior Roma Murphy, called the policy harsh and detrimental to students’ mental and physical health and their ability to observe religious holidays.
According to the student petitioners, in response to the petition, SCA said it would send an email to students clarifying the policy; however, the school has not yet done so. 
SCA writing vice chair David Isaacs told the petitioners that the policy was intended to grant students greater freedom regarding absences by removing the standard of proof concerning what qualifies as a legitimate absence. It was not enacted to force students to attend classes.
Dean Elizabeth Daley did not respond to request for comment regarding the policy change in time for publication.
However, the petitioners said they remain skeptical about the policy’s implementation. They emphasized the importance of excused absences in the letter, stating that it is unfair to ask that students jeopardize their mental and physical well-being to attend class. This semester, the department is not taking into consideration the reason behind an absence. This includes excuses such as religious observance and health issues, which did not typically count against a student in the past. 
“In an environment as high-stress as SCA, in which students work full-time jobs on top of taking full courseloads, it is imperative that students have the chance to rest,” the petition read. “Of course, it would be optimal if that time of rest did not have to come during class hours, but students should be free to take that time if necessary, as we discussed in the memorial meeting last semester.” 
Nine students died over the course of last semester, three of whom were SCA students. SCA students have since vocalized concerns regarding the University’s mental health resources and their accessibility, calling out the school’s competitive culture. 
In a December Daily Trojan Letter to the Editor, Alyssa Callahan, then an SCA senior, cited Intermediate Production, an upper-division production course that is often labeled as a source of great stress for its students. Callahan wrote that professors prioritize projects over students’ mental well-being.
Murphy, who is majoring in writing for screen and television, emphasized the importance of balancing academic responsibilities with well-being.
“People shouldn’t have to choose between their grades and their health,” the petitioners wrote  said. “Mental health needs to be a priority for SCA and USC as a whole. Students’ lives are at stake.”
Finley Brown, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television, said he was upset when he saw the new attendance policy on his syllabus this semester. Despite sometimes missing class for extracurricular activities and health issues, Brown said attendance typically did not impact his class performance.
“My grades are very important to me, and in many of the classes I’ve had where attendance has been an issue, they’ve all been ones where I’m also able to keep up with the course load without physically being present in class,” Brown said. “My physical presence is now such a bigger part of my grade, which makes my student life a lot more stressful.”
Brown also said the department implemented the policy at a time when students are still recovering from last semester’s mental health crisis. He said the new rule enforces stringent requirements for students while letting professors off easy. 
“It’s kind of frustrating because, within a week’s worth of practice, I’ve had two professors miss a total of three classes,” Brown said. “It feels like we’re being held to a different standard of excused absences for them [professors], but for us, we don’t get that luxury.”
Screenwriting professor Bonnie Garvin, who has taught at SCA since 2004, said a policy that does not permit student absences is unnecessary and that students should have more control over their education. 
“Requiring people to come to class is a good thing, on the other hand, I don’t want to take away the student responsibility,” Garvin said. “You’re paying a lot of money, and if you want to be in this business, you had better learn to show up. ” 
Garvin also said that students have the right to appeal to the department about the policy change. 
“Students are much more apt to complain than when I went to school, which is probably because students feel more free to complain,” Garvin said. “They’re paying for it, they have every right.”
Students said they feel the policy reinforces a toxic atmosphere and negatively impacts the student body.
“There’s a line in there that says ‘an absence is an absence,’ underlined and bolded,” Murphy said. “In my experience, a lot of professors in SCA use that kind of rhetoric to sort of promote this really unhealthy culture. A lot of professors will say, ‘If you’re sick, come in anyway’ … ‘The industry won’t wait for you, so you gotta do it anyway.’” 
The students said the policy may also pose a serious risk to students with autoimmune diseases, whose lives could be threatened by the presence of contagious illnesses. 
Mandating students to prioritize class attendance over personal health disregards the importance of self-care and taking adequate time to recover from illness, Murphy said. 
“A big contributor to anxiety is the feeling that small mistakes will lead to intractable consequences for one’s future,” Murphy wrote. “If arriving late to class or missing class is enough to lower one’s grades … I predict an uptick in the degree of anxiety experienced by students.”
