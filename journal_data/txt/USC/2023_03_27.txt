Eight years ago, Daniel Cooper retired from playing the game of baseball professionally. At only 28 years old and six years removed from a stellar senior season at USC in 2009 that led to him being drafted by the Seattle Mariners, it was a heartbreaking end to a promising career.  
There was a variety of reasons why making the MLB, baseball’s American dream, faded away for Cooper.
Physically, he was breaking down. He deals with thoracic outlet syndrome, a disease that makes it difficult to have feeling in the fingers of his pitching hand. He was also overwhelmed with anxiety surrounding his performance, and couldn’t go on playing without addressing his mental struggles. He couldn’t keep up with the demands of the game and as a result, he was getting batted around. His career minor league ERA ballooned to 4.80. He played his final professional season in Australia for the Brisbane Bandits, and his ERA was still high at 4.03. 
After his return home from Brisbane in 2015, he would never have another professional opportunity in baseball.
But Cooper’s baseball odyssey doesn’t end there. In fact, in the years following 2015, baseball would become something even greater for him: a passion project, the origin of a love story and a revolution that is sweeping through an entire country.
This seems impossible, given that baseball basically gave up on him. 
But it happened, and it all started with two decisions he made in that crucial year, 2015.
The first one was to see a neurotherapist. Cooper knew that to continue with baseball in any capacity, he needed to work on his mental game. A friend of his connected him to a neurotherapist named Alexa Schmidt. The two bonded over a shared experience as athletes. 
“I was a professional dancer the majority of my life, and I too suffered from a debilitating injury very early on,” Schmidt said. “We connected on that in a very unique way.”  
The two had a strong friendship and professional relationship for a while, but felt their bond growing even stronger and eventually started dating. In December of this past year, they got engaged. 
It was a desire to be better at baseball that indirectly led him to the love of his life. Her neurotherapeutic help, as well as her personal relationship with Cooper, gave her the passenger seat on the journey that Cooper sparked with his next big decision: to keep playing baseball.
But how could he do that? There were no professional opportunities left for him.
True, no one was willing to pay him to play baseball. But Cooper didn’t need a financial incentive to play the game, because he truly loves it.
“The excitement and the commitment he has to [baseball] is just very inspiring,” Schmidt said.
And there was a team that needed that kind of passion: Great Britain’s national baseball team.
The opportunity to represent Great Britain on the baseball diamond was something that Cooper had been pursuing since 2012, when Great Britain tried, and failed, to qualify for the 2013 World Baseball Classic.
Back then, there was almost no British representation in professional baseball. Cooper’s manager for the British national team, Drew Spencer, said that getting Cooper to represent the Union Jack was incredibly meaningful.
“He started out as one of those big names,” Spencer said, “10 years ago, you kinda go, ‘Wow, we got a guy named Daniel Cooper, he went to USC and he’s pitched in pro ball!’ And so he was a name that helped us recruit people.”
At the time, Great Britain baseball was badly in need of more talent.
“I think we were ranked 40th [in the world] when I first started,” Cooper said.
But from the moment Cooper first joined the team, he began to help them steadily climb the rankings.
In 2015, when the professional opportunities stopped, he could have hung up his cleats entirely and stopped playing for Great Britain too. He needed a full time job, and the British team couldn’t provide him consistent employment or pay. If he kept playing for the Brits, it would be only as a hobby or a passion project of sorts.
So the question became only if he loved it enough to keep playing.
His answer was a resoundingly passionate yes.
“I can’t touch on enough how much it means to me to help spread baseball to Great Britain,” Cooper said. “There’s young kids out there [in Great Britain] who love this game, who are learning it … the young talent, homegrown from England, it’s just been really great to see.”
That passion wasn’t always returned by British citizens.
“A lot of people in the country don’t even know we have a baseball team,” Cooper said.
But Cooper and his teammates continued to put their whole heart and soul into representing Great Britain, and seven years later, they had the opportunity of a lifetime to finally help British baseball shine on the world stage.
Led by phenom catcher Harry Ford, they qualified for the World Baseball Classic for the first time ever in 2022 at the World Baseball Classic qualifiers in Regensburg, Germany. The WBC is a tournament where national teams compete for a championship, similar to the World Cup in soccer. It’s international baseball’s biggest competition.
Their seeding in the WBC slotted them into the same pool as the United States national team, which was stacked with MLB stars such as Mike Trout, Trea Turner, Mookie Betts and Nolan Arenado. Mexico, Canada and Colombia were also in Pool C, and the pool games were played at Chase Field, the home of the Arizona Diamondbacks, in Phoenix, Ariz.
And so, 11 years after his last Minor League Baseball game and eight years after retiring from professional baseball, Cooper had a chance to play against baseball’s biggest stars on the game’s biggest international stage.
“It’s honestly surreal,” Cooper said. “I get kind of emotional thinking about it, I got chills thinking about it … for how many times I keep telling myself I need to retire, and I almost quit because of injuries and stuff, to have this moment.”
When the moment finally came, he was beyond ready. Despite having a fastball that tops out at about 84 mph, Cooper snuck pitches past the best hitters in the world. In his two games in the tournament, he pitched 2.2 innings, gave up only 1 run and struck out two batters.
But the most impressive aspect of Cooper’s pitching appearances was the hitters he got out. Against the U.S., he got Kyle Schwarber, Kyle Tucker, Betts and Trout to fly out, Jeff McNeil to ground out and he struck out Turner.
“Walking off the mound against USA, he was kinda like, ‘Who did I get out there?’ And someone said ‘Oh, that was Trea Turner.’ And he went, ‘Oh cool, he’s on my fantasy team,’” Spencer laughed.
For reference, Turner went on to hit 5 home runs and drive in 11 and was arguably the best player in the entire tournament.
In his second appearance against Mexico, he came on in a tight 2-1 game in the bottom of the seventh inning with a runner on first base and proceeded to strike out Randy Arozarena and get Alex Verdugo to ground out.
For reference, Arozarena went on to hit .450 with 9 RBIs and produce clutch moment after clutch moment, leading Mexico to the semifinals for the first time ever. He was probably the most clutch performer in the entire tournament.
Cooper struck out two of the tournament’s top three performers. While he didn’t get a chance to face eventual tournament MVP Shohei Ohtani, considering he struck out the other two MVP candidates, who’s to say he couldn’t have struck him out too? 
His team lost both of the games he pitched in, 6-2 against Team USA and 2-1 versus Mexico, but showed they could compete with two of the top teams in the tournament.
Against Colombia, they won 7-5, which marked their first World Baseball Classic win ever, a jubilant moment for the country. It also gave the team an automatic qualification for the 2026 WBC, where they hope to string together even more victories.
Cooper is not sure whether or not he will play in the next classic. But whether he does or not, the people in his inner circle who have seen his journey finally reach the mountaintop after all these years are proud of him.
“Coop has proved that, you know, baseball doesn’t have to stop when you stop being paid or when the dream of making it to the big leagues is over,” Spencer said.
Baseball will surely never stop for Cooper. Whether he plays for Great Britain in spring 2026 or not, his glove will always be within reach, and as long as he has a baseball field and a right arm, he’ll try to throw his sinker past anyone that will challenge him.
And they’ll probably swing and miss.

Being Caribbean at USC is like being a tomato in a fruit basket. The Latine community and its organizations are the fruit basket in which I should theoretically feel included. However, this is far from reality. Although the University appears to value all of its Latino students equally, it is just a facade as most of the time only Mexican culture — and occasionally some Central American cultures — is represented.
One of the main reasons I chose USC was because it seemed to have a vibrant Latine community. However, coming here and seeing the organizations and events planned by the University and the clubs was like taking a cold bath. The only culinary options at Latine events seem to be tacos, pupusas, pan dulce and churros. I have lost count of how many events include lotería — which I had never understood until I sat down to write this piece. The special guests for the activities are mostly Mexican, and when they aren’t, they feel like a non-Mexican Latine diversity token. For example, a recent event featured three panelists with Mexican roots and one Colombian panelist. The lack of balance in cultural representation is evident.
The situation improves a little musically, but not completely. Although it is common to hear the Caribbean sound of reggaeton at some Latine parties, it does not take much analysis to conclude that attendees only know reggaeton thanks to the recent worldwide fame the genre has achieved after Bad Bunny’s unprecedented success. Plan B and Don Omar songs go unnoticed while everyone sings “Un verano is ti” at the top of their lungs. I am extremely proud of the work that Puerto Rican artists have done to make the genre recognized worldwide, but this discrepancy reminds me that until a few years ago, reggaeton — and Caribbean vocabulary in general — was degraded by the rest of the Latine community and labeled as “bad Spanish.”
However, these parties where I can identify with the music — although not completely — are the only connection I find with the rest of the Latine students at USC. In search of Latine connections, a Colombian friend and I tried to join a Latina sorority. Although I was accepted, I decided not to join because between the majority of the chapter being born in the United States and its events typically revolving around exclusively Central American cultures, I felt like a puzzle piece that didn’t fit. Although I was surrounded by Latinas, I had no sense of belonging. 
During the last Latine Heritage Month, one of the most popular Latine organizations created a series of Instagram posts highlighting different Latin American countries. However, my joy at the representation of other countries did not last very long. The posts included each country’s independence date and, when it was Puerto Rico’s turn, the author did no more than a three-second Google search — and if you’re wondering, yes, I did the exercise — to conclude that our independence date was July 4 because we are part of the U.S. The problem? Puerto Rico is a U.S. colony and therefore we do not celebrate any independence date. Although the organization later made another publication rectifying its error and briefly explaining our colonial situation, this did not erase the bitter taste of the error made during one of the few times I have felt represented at the University. 
Don’t get me wrong. I understand that the Mexican population is the largest among USC’s Latine populations due to geographic and sociopolitical reasons. I understand why this community is more catered to than South America and the Caribbean. However, organizations should recognize that this gap in representation is significantly bigger than it should be and work to close it. I’m not saying the University or its organizations have never done events that include South American elements, but they are rare and far in between. A diversity between Latine cultures that barely exists should not be advertised.
As Latines, if we demand more representation in the media, we must first work on our intracultural diversity. We cannot denounce Hollywood for presenting the Latine community as a monolith when Latine organizations in an institution with USC’s influence treat the Latine community the same way. The fact that we are all Latine does not mean that we share the same culture. It’s the cultural diversity that makes Latin America so rich. For starters, there is no reason why Latine events should feature the same food each time when there are so many cuisines to choose from.
During this school year, I have been blessed with an incredible group of Latino-Caribbean friends with whom I momentarily feel at home. We get together to eat rice and beans with fried plantains while we listen to salsa or old reggaeton. However, this inevitably leads me to think about how nice it would be to have organized events in which we are better represented and in which we can connect from our diversities. In a city I rarely feel represented as is, I would hope the Latine organizations at my college would at least try to include my culture.

El español siempre ha sido un lenguaje dominado por géneros gramaticales — todos los sustantivos en el lenguaje son marcados con una ‘o’ si son masculinos y una ‘a’ si son femeninos. Sin embargo, durante los últimos 20 años, ha habido un movimiento para implementar lenguaje inclusivo dentro del español con el fin de incluir a aquellas personas que no se identifican con el sistema de género binario. 
Aunque las conversaciones sobre el lenguaje inclusivo en los Estados Unidos han incluído la ‘e’ y la ‘x’ como opciones neutrales, la profesora Liana Stepanyan dijo que el cambio a la letra ‘e’ en vez de la ‘x’ se ajusta mejor fonológicamente. Además, este cambio ha sido usado en las comunidades no binarias anteriormente. Stepanyan mencionó el ‘Gender in Language Project’, proyecto realizado por estudiantes  de la Universidad de California, Berkeley, que tiene como objetivo educar  a otras personas en cómo implementar estos pronombres de forma gramaticalmente correcta.
Stepanyan también discutió un experimento que realizó con 200 estudiantes en el que añadía la letra ‘e’ al final de los sustantivos para denotar la ausencia de una marca de género. Stepanyan además incluyó pronombres con marcas de género neutro como “elle”, “elles”, “nosotres” y “vosotres”. Su meta es que estos pronombres sean normalizados dentro del lenguaje.
“Después de hacer unas actividades que incluyen el lenguaje sin género, los estudiantes respondieron positivamente a los cambios, diciendo que no era tan difícil”, dijo Stepanyan. “La diferencia es dramática comparado con lo que pensaron antes del ejercicio — pensaron que iba ser más difícil”.
Érica Rodríguez, quien cursa su primer año de biología humana, dijo que el cambio de ‘x’ a ‘e’ se le hizo más fácil y natural para pronunciar. 
“Está bien quitarle el género a las palabras de esa forma porque si añades la ‘x’, estás anglicanizando el español y eso no tendría sentido para una persona de habla hispana”, dijo. 
A Andrea Salazar López, quien cursa su primer año de leyes, historia y cultura, tampoco se le hizo difícil implementar el cambio. 
“De la misma manera que podemos decir pronombres de ‘ella’ o ‘él’, podemos decir ‘elles’ para respetar a una persona”, dijo.
Stepanyan decidió comenzar a incluir estos cambios en 2018, cuando estudiantes no binaries visitaron el Departamento de Culturas Latinoamericanas e Ibéricas para preguntar cómo incluir a personas no binarias dentro de un lenguaje marcado por el uso del género binario.  
“No sabíamos de qué estaban hablando”, dijo Stepanyan. “Había otras formas de evitar el género. Pero a medida de que sus preguntas comenzaron a ser más y más específicas, comenzamos a consultar otros académicos en otras universidades hasta llegar a estas nuevas palabras”.
La Real Academia Española, el ente regulador del idioma español, se ha rehusado a aceptar opciones de lenguaje neutro.  En una entrevista con El País en 2018, la institución declaró que “el género gramatical no puede modificarse por decisión de unas personas”. 
La resistencia de la RAE viene desde 1976, cuando el ingeniero español Álvaro García Meseguer propuso el uso de la terminación ‘e’ como opción gramaticalmente neutra para reducir la frecuencia con la que se usaban palabras masculinas a comparación con las femeninas. En el 2020, la RAE incluyó ‘elle’ en su Observatorio de Palabras Nuevas, pero lo quitó dos semanas después debido a “la confusión que ha generado” el pronombre. 
El cambio hacia un lenguaje más neutral se ha visto no sólo entre las generaciones más jóvenes, sino también en gobiernos latinoamericanos como Colombia, donde la vicepresidenta Francia Márquez usó el lenguaje inclusivo durante una entrevista. Sin embargo, esto no estuvo libre de controversia. La senadora del partido conservador colombiano María Restrepo tuiteó “Que Dios salve a Colombia!”, en respuesta. 
Salazar López dijo que el uso de formas de género neutro es una buena manera de ser más inclusivos con personas que no se identifican con pronombres binarios, aunque todavía no usa el lenguaje inclusivo en su día a día.
Nohemi Vela, quien cursa su primer año de neurociencia, dijo que este movimiento nace de la constante demanda de la Generación Z por cambios sociales y su rechazo hacia estándares normativos. Sin embargo, Vela dijo que se necesita más educación sobre el tema.
“No estamos usando estos pronombres neutrales frecuentemente … porque no nos educan muy bien sobre [estos temas]”, dijo Vela. “Muchos todavía no saben que existen estos pronombres dentro de EE. UU.”.
En cambio, Luca Schaefer, quien cursa su primer año de filosofía y leyes, dijo que está bien ser inclusivos, pero el lenguaje inclusivo no es gramaticalmente correcto.
“Las palabras no sólo son para un grupo”, dijo Schaefer. “Es la gramática para incluir a todos y cambiarla es muy difícil y muy diferente”. 
De acuerdo a Stepanyan, cambiar la cultura es difícil, especialmente porque latinoamérica tiende a ser bastante conservadora. Por lo tanto, siempre va a haber resistencia hacia el cambio del lenguaje. 
“Lo que decimos es que la lengua evoluciona”, dijo Stepanyan. “La lengua ha, históricamente,  evolucionado a incluir otras palabras. Lo que proponemos nosotros es también un cambio sociológico … la lengua también tiene que reflejar los cambios sociales”.

More than one-third of the low-income households in Los Angeles County experienced food insecurity in 2022 – an increase from the pre-pandemic level of 27%, research from the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ Public Exchange found.
Published in February, the study analyzed data from the Understanding America Study, a USC internet survey panel and 31 interviews conducted with L.A. County residents who self-identified as experiencing food insecurity.
The food insecurity rate among low-income residents had been improving prior to the pandemic, with a 4% drop from 2011 to 2018. During the peak of the pandemic, the food insecurity rate surged to 42% but quickly returned to 28% in 2021.
The tide turned in 2022, when the all-household food insecurity rates in L.A. County rate spiked to 24%.
“The first year of [coronavirus], 34% were food insecure. It got a lot better — down to 17% in 2021. And now in 2022, we’re going in the wrong direction,” said Dr. Kayla de la Haye, project lead of the study.
De la Haye, associate professor of population and public health sciences, warned that the return of food insecurity rates to pre-pandemic levels would disproportionately worsen healthy food access for individuals who are low-income, women, young adults, Latine and Black.
The data sheds light on food inequality in L.A. County — food insecurity rates among Black and Hispanic residents are three times higher than the rates among white residents in 2022.
“We also see that certain segments of the community are way more impacted by [food insecurity] than other people,” de la Haye said. “Part of this is really an issue of food justice and unequal financial access in somebody’s neighborhood to affordable healthy food.”
Other factors include inflation, which causes food prices to skyrocket, and the ending of the pandemic-era programs such as CalFresh emergency allotments and Pandemic-EBT.
“The taking back of their benefits just makes their life became harder,” said Mengya Xu, a project researcher and graduate student studying population, health and place. “We also think about what we can do to help them to gain more that benefits to balance their budgets that can be used for food.”
As part of the three-year research project, the study dives into four predominantly Latine neighborhoods — Boyle Heights, City Terrace, El Sereno and Lincoln Heights — where half of the census is characterized as “food deserts” by the United States Department of Agriculture, to analyze food availability and resident’s lived experience.
There are 269 retail outlets that sell groceries, inducing stories like gas stations whose primary business is not grocery sales, in the four neighborhoods, according to on-the-ground audits conducted by USC researchers. But de la Haye said a large number of retail outlets shows the food desert label doesn’t accurately represent the communities.
“A lot of folks could reach one of those stores within a 15-minute walk of their house,” de la Haye said. “But one of the challenges is that a lot of the stores that were there just didn’t have a good variety of healthy and affordable food.”
Almost half of the retail stores provide less than 25% of space for groceries, and a majority of them sell processed food, while whole foods such as fruit, vegetables and grains are less accessible, the study found.
Smaller businesses that sell food products such as bakery stores and dollar stores account for 87% of the retail outlets — the remaining 13% being large supermarkets where fresh vegetables, fruit and milk are more abundant and affordable. Residents shared in interviews about their demand for more food options, higher quality and more affordable food in local stores.
“Most residents would like to see the existing stores in their neighborhood provide better access to healthy high quality, organic, affordable foods,” said Cynthia Ramirez, a research assistant in charge of conducting and analyzing qualitative interviews.
In August 2022, USC researchers interviewed 31 residents in the four neighborhoods, gathering information on residents’ sources of food, challenges and improvements in access to healthy food. Although it seems like a small number, the sample of interviews is adequate enough to reflect residents’ main concerns.
Ramirez, a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Population and Public Health Sciences, said that data saturation occurs when the marginal data doesn’t provide any new information. In the food insecurity research, data saturation happens between the twelfth and twentieth interviews.
“Because we weren’t conducting interviews across several different neighborhoods, we decided to keep collecting data, just to make sure that we didn’t miss any key insight,” Ramirez said.
The study combined databases from the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank and Findhelp, a social services search engine, to investigate the 30 food assistance programs operating in the four neighborhoods. Almost one in four of the households don’t have access to any food assistance provider within a 15-minute walk, the study found.
“It’s not about just getting individuals to have the cash they need every month [though] that’s part of the solution,” de la Haye said. “The whole system really needs to be improved so that there’s equal access to healthy food for everyone.”

Daniel Cooper se retiró del béisbol profesional hace 8 años, tan solo seis años después de una temporada senior estelar en USC en 2009 que lo llevó a ser reclutado por los Mariners de Seattle. Hubo varias razones por las que las Ligas Mayores, el sueño americano del béisbol, se desvanecieron de distancia para Cooper.
Físicamente, se estaba derrumbando. Lidiaba con el síndrome del desfiladero torácico, una enfermedad que dificulta la sensación en los dedos de la mano con la que lanzaba. También estaba abrumado por la ansiedad en torno a su actuación y no podía seguir jugando sin abordar sus problemas mentales. 
Sin embargo, aún ante esta adversidad, su efectividad en las Ligas Menores se disparó a 4.80. Durante su última temporada profesional en Australia para los Brisbane Bandits, su efectividad aún era 4.03. Luego de su regreso de Brisbane en 2015, nunca más tendría otra oportunidad profesional en el béisbol.
Pero la odisea beisbolera de Cooper no termina ahí. De hecho, en los años posteriores a 2015, el béisbol se convertiría en algo aún más grande para él: un proyecto de pasión, el origen de una historia de amor y una revolución que se extiende por todo un país. Esto es curioso ya que el béisbol básicamente se rindió con él. Todo comenzó con dos decisiones que tomó ese 2015.
La primera fue ver a un neuroterapeuta. Cooper sabía que para continuar con el béisbol en cualquier capacidad, necesitaba trabajar en su salud mental. Un amigo lo conectó con una Alexa Schmidt, una profesional con la que compartía su experiencia como atleta.
“Fui bailarina profesional la mayor parte de mi vida y yo también sufrí una lesión debilitante muy pronto”, dijo Schmidt. “Nos conectamos en eso de una manera muy singular”.
Formaron una fuerte amistad y una relación profesional durante un tiempo, pero sintieron que su vínculo se fortalecía aún más y eventualmente comenzaron a salir. En diciembre del año pasado, se comprometieron.
Fue el deseo de ser mejor en el béisbol lo que indirectamente llevó a Cooper al amor de su vida. Luego, la ayuda neuroterapéutica, así como su relación personal con Schmidt, le dieron la confianza para su próxima gran decisión: seguir jugando béisbol. Pero, ¿cómo pudo hacer eso? No le quedaban oportunidades profesionales.
Nadie estaba dispuesto a pagarle por jugar béisbol, pero Cooper no necesitaba un incentivo financiero para jugar el deporte que ama. En eso, se anunció que había un equipo que necesitaba ese tipo de pasión: el equipo nacional de Gran Bretaña.
La oportunidad de representar a Gran Bretaña en el campo de béisbol era algo que Cooper había perseguido desde 2012, cuando Gran Bretaña intentó — y fracasó — clasificar para el Clásico Mundial de Béisbol, o WBC por sus siglas en inglés, de 2013.
En ese entonces, casi no había representación británica en el béisbol profesional. El gerente del equipo nacional británico, Drew Spencer, dijo que lograr que Cooper representara el Union Jack fue increíblemente significativo.
“Comenzó como uno de esos grandes nombres”, dijo Spencer. “Hace 10 años, uno decía: ‘¡Tenemos a un tipo llamado Daniel Cooper, fue a USC y ha lanzado en la pelota profesional!’ fue un nombre que nos ayudó a reclutar gente”.
Desde el momento en que Cooper se unió al equipo, comenzó a ayudarlos a ascender en su clasificación mundial. Sin embargo, en 2015 cuando sus oportunidades profesionales se desvanecieron, podría haber colgado los zapatos por completo y no jugar para Gran Bretaña. Necesitaba un trabajo de tiempo completo y el equipo británico no podía proporcionarle un salario fijo. Si seguía jugando para su país, sería solo como un pasatiempo. Entonces, la pregunta era si amaba el deporte lo suficiente como para seguir jugando. Su respuesta fue un rotundo y apasionado sí.
“No puedo mencionar lo mucho que significa para mí ayudar a difundir el béisbol en Gran Bretaña”, dijo Cooper. “Hay niños pequeños [en Gran Bretaña] a los que les encanta este juego, que lo están aprendiendo… el talento joven, de cosecha propia de Inglaterra, ha sido realmente genial de ver”.
Esa pasión no siempre fue correspondida por los ciudadanos británicos.
“Mucha gente en el país ni siquiera sabe que tenemos un equipo de béisbol”, dijo Cooper.
Pero Cooper y sus compañeros de equipo continuaron poniendo todo su corazón en representar a Gran Bretaña. Siete años más tarde, tuvieron la oportunidad de su vida de finalmente hacer el béisbol británico brillar en el escenario mundial cuando clasificaron por primera vez al WBC bajo el liderazgo del receptor Harry Ford. El WBC es la competencia más grande del béisbol internacional.
Su clasificación en el WBC los colocó en el mismo grupo que los Estados Unidos, que estaba repleto de estrellas de la MLB como Mike Trout, Trea Turner, Mookie Betts y Nolan Arenado. México, Canadá y Colombia también estaban en el Grupo C. Los juegos del grupo se jugaron en Chase Field, el hogar de los Diamondbacks de Arizona, en Phoenix, Arizona.
Así, 11 años después de su último partido de béisbol de ligas menores y 8 años después de retirarse del béisbol profesional, Cooper tuvo la oportunidad de jugar contra las estrellas más grandes del béisbol en el escenario internacional más grande del juego.
“Es honestamente surrealista”, dijo Cooper. “Me emociono un poco al pensar en eso, me dan escalofríos solo de pensarlo… cuántas veces me dije a mí mismo que necesitaba retirarme y casi renuncio debido a las lesiones y esas cosas, para tener este momento”.
Cuando finalmente llegó el momento, estaba más que preparado. A pesar de tener una bola rápida que alcanza un máximo de aproximadamente 84 mph, Cooper superó a los mejores bateadores del mundo. En sus dos juegos en el torneo, lanzó 2.2 entradas, permitió solo una carrera y ponchó a dos bateadores.
Pero el aspecto más impresionante de las apariciones de Cooper como lanzador fueron los bateadores que eliminó. Contra EE. UU., consiguió que Kyle Schwarber, Kyle Tucker, Mookie Betts y Mike Trout salieran con elevados, Jeff McNeil hiciera un roletazo y ponchó a Trea Turner.
“Al salir del montículo contra EE. UU., dijo algo así como, ‘¿A quién saqué?’. Y alguien dijo: ‘Oh, ese fue Trea Turner’. Y él dijo: ‘Oh, genial, está en mi equipo de fantasía'”. 
Como referencia, Trea Turner conectó cinco jonrones y empujó 11 carreras, siendo posiblemente el mejor jugador de todo el torneo.
En su segunda aparición, contra México, entró en un apretado juego de 2-1 en la parte baja de la séptima entrada con un corredor en primera base y procedió a ponchar a Randy Arozarena y sacar a Alex Verdugo.
Randy Arozarena llegó a batear .450 con 9 carreras impulsadas y produjo momento crucial tras momento crucial, llevando a México a las semifinales por primera vez en la historia, siendo uno de los mejores jugadores del torneo. 
Cooper ponchó a dos de los tres mejores jugadores del torneo. Si bien no tuvo la oportunidad de enfrentarse al eventual MVP del torneo, Shohei Ohtani, considerando que eliminó a los otros dos candidatos al MVP, ¿quién puede decir que no podría haberlo eliminado también?
Su equipo perdió los dos juegos en los que lanzó, 6-2 contra el equipo de EE. UU. y 2-1 contra México, pero demostró que podía competir con dos de los mejores equipos del torneo.
Contra Colombia, ganaron 7-5, lo que marcó su primera victoria en el Clásico Mundial de Béisbol, un momento de júbilo para el país. También le dio al equipo una clasificación automática para el WBC 2026, donde esperan encadenar aún más victorias.
Cooper no está seguro de si jugará o no en el próximo clásico. Haga lo que haga, todos los que han visto su viaje finalmente llegar a la cima de la montaña después de todos estos años están muy orgullosos de él.
“Coop ha demostrado que el béisbol no tiene que parar cuando dejan de pagarte o cuando se acaba el sueño de llegar a las grandes ligas”, dijo Spencer.
El béisbol seguramente nunca se detendrá para Daniel Cooper. Ya sea que juegue para Gran Bretaña en la primavera de 2026 o no, su guante siempre estará a su alcance, y mientras tenga un campo de béisbol y un brazo derecho, intentará lanzar su sinker más allá de cualquiera que lo desafíe.
Y probablemente se balancearán y fallarán.

Following one of their worst losses of the season, a 3-0 beatdown away at the hands of No. 4 Long Beach State on Friday night, the No. 11 USC men’s volleyball team needed a better showing in their rematch against The Beach at Galen Center. A win would help build confidence for the stretch run of the season that lay ahead. 
Saturday night’s 3-1 defeat wasn’t the result they hoped for, but they were much improved in every facet of the game, putting up an incredible fight against one of the best teams in the country. 
“I think our block and defense was up to par. I thought our defensive spots and decisions were good. I thought when we had opportunities to control free balls, we put them where we needed to to have opportunities to run a good offense. I think our serving was pretty good,” Head Coach Jeff Nygaard said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I think the one thing we needed to do [differently] was just put more balls away.”
It didn’t always look like it was going to be an improved result. Long Beach went on a huge run in the first set, scoring 10 consecutive points to go up 23-10 and eventually winning the set 25-13 to earn a 1-0 lead in the match. 
But the Trojans stormed back with an equally dominant victory in the second set, winning 25-14. The Trojans never trailed in the set and held Long Beach to a .115 hitting percentage while hitting .455 in their own right. 
The third set was much more highly contested, in more ways than one. The score remained tight throughout, and both sides felt the importance of each point. As a result, there were several coach’s challenges and replay reviews throughout the set, and many ensuing discussions between officials and coaches. In all, the set lasted a whopping 54 minutes.
“I would say that all of those breaks and challenges started bleeding into the speed of the game,” Nygaard said. “For a while there, it was annoying and it was [like], ‘What are we doing?’ But over time, that just became the norm … for the most part, I thought we actually just kept focused pretty well during it.” 
The Trojans gave it their all every minute of the nearly hour long set, but in the end, The Beach emerged a few points ahead, capturing a 27-25 set victory to take a 2-1 lead in the match. 
The Trojans hit well enough to set themselves up for success in the fourth set. Redshirt junior opposite hitter Simon Gallas had five kills and graduate outside hitter Kevin Kobrine had three to lead the Trojans to a .250 hitting percentage while LBSU hit only .179. 
However, the Trojans were far overmatched at the service line. The Beach had four service aces in the frame, and the Trojans had five service errors. Those nine points made all the difference as The Beach emerged with a narrow 25-21 victory in the set, giving them a 3-1 win in the match. 
It was a tough loss to swallow for the Trojans, especially since they were within string distance of wins in the third and fourth sets. However, they still take pride in such a strong showing against an elite team like Long Beach. 
“As a team, we’re on the cusp of greatness,” junior setter Nate Tennant said. “We just gotta be great. We have all the pieces. We’re a great block and defense team, when our serving is on and our passing is on, we’re unstoppable. We just got to put those pieces together.” 
Tennant was one Trojan who especially shined in the match, as he put together an elite performance defensively with 15 digs, which, along with his 29 assists, gave him his second career double-double. Add in three kills and three blocks and it was clear that Tennant was playing well in every facet of the game. 
Tennant was adamant that his success would not have been possible without his incredibly skilled teammates around him. 
“We run a good system, we block really well so definitely kudos to the blockers because [Long Beach] is trying to hit around [the blockers] or blockers are getting good touches, and I’m just there,” Tennant said. 
Another Trojan who turned in a signature performance was Gallas. The redshirt junior led the team with 12 kills and added six digs, four blocks and a service ace. It continued his season-long trend of turning in his best performances in the Trojans’ matches against high ranked teams. 
Gallas’s tendency to play at an elite level against elite teams is likely due to his focused mentality. 
“Our motto is that each point counts as one point, no matter if you’re up or down,” Gallas said. 
The Trojans will need that level-headedness and focus for every single point in the coming weeks as they enter the final stretch of the season. 
The Trojans will travel to BYU next week to face the Cougars Thursday and Friday night at 6 p.m. at Smith Fieldhouse. Trojan fans watching at home can tune in to BYU TV.

One of the biggest talking points in recent weeks in the basketball world is Ja Morant’s conduct off the court. After losing to the Denver Nuggets 113-97 March 3, Morant went live on Instagram at a nightclub, seemingly enjoying himself. He would then make the most serious mistake in his young career and show a gun. While Morant faced no charges from the Colorado police, it sparked a lot of discussion in the NBA world about his actions and how the 23 year old carries himself.
With personalities like Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless, among many others, commenting on Morant’s blip, much of the conversation is talking about how the Memphis guard needs to use this experience as a valuable lesson as a public face. The NBA suspended Morant for eight games, letting him off lightly in comparison to the speculated 50 games that he could have faced. 
This debacle uncovered a bunch of other things that Morant has done in previous years, like beating up a 17-year-old kid during an off-season pick-up game and threatening multiple people on-and-off the court.
It’s not the first time a young superstar has put themselves in trouble and, unfortunately, I don’t think it will be the last. For example, take Mario Balotelli and his early years at Inter Milan and Manchester City. The Italian was a young problematic striker who, even he admitted, “[does] strange things” off the field. While he was an issue with his antics, he had all the talent in the world to become one of the best players in the game. 
“If Mario is not one of the best players in the world it will be his fault, because he has everything,” said Roberto Mancini, Balotelli’s manager at Man City during his stint. “Mario can be one of the top players in Europe. I don’t want him to lose his talent.”
Mancini’s words proved to be prophetic, as the Italian sensation would fall off immensely, becoming a journeyman as the years went by, bouncing around clubs looking to regain his powers and prove himself to be what everyone wanted him to be: a superstar. While he did have some fruitful years in France at both OGC Nice and Olympique de Marseille, the adage of old habits die hard would be the case. He fell out of favor with then-Nice manager Patrick Vieira for showing up late to practice during pre-season as he weighed his options about a move out of the club. While he performed well during his six-month tenure at Marseille, scoring eight goals in 15 games, the French side opted to not offer him a contract for the 2019-20 season.
One of the Italian’s most famous mishaps was when he blew up his house after lighting fireworks inside the bathroom. While thankfully there were no injuries, it proved to be one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard about an athlete. Also, during the infancy of his career, the then 20-year-old striker was spotted touring the estate of Scampia with two mob bosses, which caused a stir in the media. While Balotelli proved to have no real affiliation with the pair, his curiosity put him in the public light in a negative manner.
Moving back stateside, another potential star in the NBA faced controversies during his time. Former Charlotte Hornets forward Miles Bridges is another case of being an enigmatic talent. The Flint, Mich. native was selected 12th in the 2018 NBA draft and looked to be well on his way to becoming a perennial All-Star for the rest of his career as he averaged 20.2 points, 3.8 assists and seven rebounds in the 2021-22 season. 
However, the up-and-coming talent later got charged with domestic violence after assaulting his then-girlfriend. Bridges was given three years probation, facing no jail time and was “required to complete 52 weeks of domestic violence counseling and 52 weeks of parenting classes, serve 100 hours of community service and undergo weekly narcotics testing with marijuana allowed only if there is a valid doctor’s prescription,” according to ESPN.
Along with that, Bridges didn’t do himself any favors of putting him in a favorable light before that whole issue went down. The 25-year-old is also a rapper, going by the name of RTB MB, with RTB standing for Real Trench Baby and MB being his initials. In his song, “Intro,” his most streamed song on Spotify, there’s multiple lines about guns, having shooters, women and everything that would appear on a typical trap song. 
While I wouldn’t really bat an eye if I heard this from artists like Future and Young Thug, knowing that Bridges was literally a standout player at the Hornets boggles my mind as to why he’d portray himself in this manner. I’m not saying he shouldn’t juggle rapping and hooping, as superstar guard Damian Lillard does the same, but the topics that the two rap about are night and day in comparison. While Dame D.O.L.L.A. does flaunt his luxurious lifestyle in his songs, he’s not dropping lines like “We got Glocks, we got chops, ain’t no runnin’ up,” or “I ain’t even hit her, ‘cause before, she was spinnin’ me (Bitch) / Pop him and his mans, they remind me of the Kennedys.”
It’s evident that mentorship is needed for these players with high potential. With new riches and fame comes a lot of newfound responsibility, which can be difficult to handle when everything you used to do was lowkey. Nowadays, people look back at what high-profile athletes used to say on social media platforms and critique them so the new generation needs extra surveillance and care on how they conduct themselves in the public eye. 
With Morant touted to be the new face of the NBA once LeBron James retires, hopefully he can use this suspension as a lesson and at others and their outcomes and learn from that to keep him on the right path. It would be a shame to see another world-class talent’s career go up in flames because of some preventable actions.

“Hemos matado [el fútbol]”, dijo Klaus German, un comentarista deportivo, después de un gol rechazado durante el partido entre River Plate y Lanús el pasado 3 de marzo. El rechazo en cuestión ocurrió luego de nueve minutos de deliberación para decidir si la pelota había rozado – benignamente – la pierna de un jugador de Lanús que estaba en posición adelantada antes de hacer el gol. El árbitro determinó que hubo posición adelantada, a costa del ritmo y el deleite del juego.
Muchos comparten este sentimiento, especialmente tomando en consideración la cantidad de partidos en que un gol ha sido rechazado por márgenes demasiado finos que sólo el árbitro asistente virtual, o VAR, por sus siglas en inglés, puede identificar. Antes, cuando esto ocurría, se otorgaba responsabilidad exclusiva al árbitro — humano — para decidir si era gol. Muchas veces la decisión del árbitro era en favor del espectáculo del juego, y aunque se podría haber tomado mucho tiempo para deliberar, no se convertía en un problema constante. 
El VAR fue introducido para evitar instancias de descuido egregio por parte del árbitro, como la famosa “Mano de Dios” de Maradona en el Mundial del ’86 que marcó el triunfo de Argentina sobre Inglaterra — que aún produce malestar en los súbditos de la corona. Las razones para evitar repetir esos errores son obvias — por lo menos desde una perspectiva de equidad. No obstante, dichos eventos son poco comunes, y el VAR se está aplicando en todos los aspectos del juego y los goles. 
El problema surge cuando esta tecnología tan precisa asume un trabajo designado para una persona con las limitaciones inherentes de un ser humano. El VAR tiene la capacidad de detectar contravenciones tan finas que más que romper las reglas del juego, llevan a la frustración de todos los involucrados. Para los árbitros, las reglas sirven porque el hecho de ser humano permite ejercer tolerancia en los casos más extraños. Los árbitros no son omnipotentes. Sin embargo, el árbitro asistente virtual — a todos los efectos — es omnipotente e impone las reglas inmutables e inimputables diseñadas para un árbitro humano. El resultado son partidos como el jugado entre River y Lanús. Para muchos, este aspecto técnico del juego arruina los partidos.
Una propuesta popular que ha surgido es el regreso del fútbol a un modelo más antiguo sin la intervención del VAR. En otros deportes como la caminata rápida, los árbitros no tienen permitido usar ningún tipo de tecnología para evaluar si los participantes tienen por lo menos un pie que toca el suelo en todo momento — aún tomando en consideración que se descalificaría al atleta si se encontrara con ambos pies elevados. El juicio humano — y su capacidad para errar — es entonces un elemento integral para este deporte. Muchos opinan lo mismo sobre el fútbol.
Por otro lado, las decisiones de un árbitro pueden arruinar un partido, por inexperiencia o ineptitud; entonces es necesario que haya un elemento sin prejuicios que asista con las decisiones que pudieran influir el resultado de un partido. En el modelo de juego contemporáneo, los problemas ocurren más debido a errores finos de los jugadores, y menos por errores groseros del árbitro. Entonces, sería mejor enfocarse en solucionar los problemas que han surgido recientemente. El costo de prescindir del VAR sería el retroceso del fútbol a una época más antigua, con sus propios problemas. Los errores del árbitro por lo tanto, no parecieran ser integrales al funcionamiento del deporte, sino que permiten mayor flexibilidad de las reglas durante el partido.
Para asegurar que el VAR le aporte valor al fútbol en vez de restarle, es necesario que un elemento humano esté integrado en las reglas del deporte. Ciertas decisiones como “fuera de línea” podrían hacerse con un juicio más flexible, dada la naturaleza humana de los árbitros que ya da tolerancia a estas instancias. Para disminuir el número de decisiones insufribles del VAR, entonces, las reglas deberían acomodar la tolerancia inherente del árbitro humano y de esa forma “humanizar” al VAR. Un árbitro asistente virtual que poseyera un grado de tolerancia evitaría las malas deliberaciones del pasado en cuanto a goles discutibles o injustamente descontados, mientras se mantendría el ritmo y la emoción del juego sin ser interrumpidos o influidos por una decisión hecha por una computadora. 
El fútbol es lindo por los momentos de ingenio y pasión que el juego puede engendrar. El resultado es secundario a la experiencia humana que nos trae el fútbol. La belleza es una invención humana dictada por las taras y preferencias de los individuos. Las fallas son parte de la belleza porque en ellas está el espíritu de la vida. La perfección le quita mérito a la belleza. El árbitro asistente virtual es simplemente una herramienta: no es necesario que defina el juego. Lo que define el fútbol y lo que más necesita ahora, es el elemento humano.

El 2022 fue un año muy importante para la música mexicana, especialmente con el renacimiento del género regional urbano y el trap corrido. Sin embargo, esta revolución musical lleva varios años en cocción. Entre  2019 y  2020, álbumes como Corridos tumbados de Natanael Cano y Atrapado en un sueño de Junior H, respectivamente, llegaron espantando a los seguidores de la música regional mexicana tradicional. Con letra hablando de marihuana, drogas y mujeres en maneras nunca antes escuchadas en una canción mexicana, es normal que este género no sea favorecido por todos. 
El aspecto más notorio de este género es la influencia del rap en inglés. Aparte de tener una cadencia similar, la imagen de los artistas es donde más se nota el efecto. Igualmente, las letras y las historias de la música regional urbana tienen más rasgos del rap estadounidense que del clásico narcocorrido. A primera vista, los artistas de este género pudieran parecer raperos estadounidenses, sin embargo, el uso de la guitarra le recuerda al público que son mexicanos. 
Cuando uno piensa en el género regional urbano, nombres como Natanael Cano vienen a la mente. Sin embargo, con el pasar del tiempo han surgido nuevos artistas que le dan su toque único al género. En este artículo, te digo los cinco artistas que están dominando este género hoy día, sirviendo como pioneros en la evolución de la música mexicana.
Herencia De Patrones
Herencia De Patrones es el balance perfecto entre el rap estadounidense y las influencias de la música mexicana. El cuarteto está compuesto por el vocalista Jay Dee, el bajista Omar Ruiz y los guitarristas Uziel “Uzi” Pantoja y Raúl Valencia. El grupo muestra drogas populares en el género del rap estadounidense — como la marihuana y el jarabe para la tos recetado —  y el dinero en la mayoría, sino en todos, sus videos musicales. La verdad, uno de sus temas más populares, redefinió el corrido. En este, Herencia de Patrones creó un híbrido entre su cadencia popular y un nuevo ritmo que atrajo al famoso rapero Drakeo The Ruler a algunas letras. En  2022 el grupo publicó un Sorry For The Wait 2, un álbum con varias canciones similares que hasta hoy día ha mantenido a los fanáticos felices. Con su tendencia de soltar un álbum cada año, sólo queda esperar otro álbum en 2023 que seguro no defraudará. 
Eslabon Armado 
Este grupo romántico está formado por cuatro personas: los hermanos Pedro y Brian Tovar como vocalista y bajista, respectivamente, Damian Pacheco en el requinto y Ulises González en la guitarra acústica. Eslabon Armado saltó a la fama con la canción Con tus besos, que sigue siendo popular a tres años de su estreno. Aparte de reimaginar el corrido, este grupo ha tomado inspiración de artistas como The Marías y Billie Eilish en álbumes recientes. En 2022, Eslabon Armado hizo historia con el álbum NOSTALGIA, que fue el primer álbum regional mexicano en estrenar entre las primeras 10 posiciones del Billboard 200. 
Peso Pluma
El novato mexicano Peso Pluma llegó al escenario con su hit del 2022, El Belicon. La voz única del intérprete sorprendió a los fanáticos del género con un tono quejumbroso, con el cual el artista mexicano le da su toque personal al tema bélico. Esto le ha funcionado muy bien. El artista ha presentado siete canciones en los últimos tres meses. Canciones como AMG cuentan con colaboraciones de leyendas del género como Natanael Cano y Gabito Ballesteros. El artista ha presentado cinco proyectos hasta la fecha, siendo el EP Sembrando, lanzado en 2022, el más reciente. 
Fuerza Regida 
Fuerza Regida, un grupo de San Bernardino, California con raíces sinaloenses, ha visto éxito durante los últimos cinco años. Jesús Ortiz Paz, el vocalista, está apoyado por José García en la tuba, Samuel Jaimez en el requinto y Khrystian Ramos en la guitarra de seis cuerdas. Su canción más popular, Sigo chambeando, se lanzó en el 2018. En este 2023 el grupo se ha enfocado en proyectos más nostálgicos. Canciones como Dijeron que no la iba lograr, con Chino Pacas, remontan a los fanáticos a los tiempos dorados del corrido regional urbano. 
Junior H
Sin duda alguna, el nombre más destacado del género durante los últimos tres años ha sido Junior H. Antonio Herrera Pérez es un artista nacido en Guanajuato y criado entre Utah y Los Ángeles en los Estados Unidos. Junior H es la definición de esta nueva época de corridos. Aparte de lanzar dos discos el año pasado, Junior H se asegura de hacer música que él quiere hacer. Siendo parte de un género que tiene tanta influencia cultural, es fácil y seguro adherirse a un sonido repetitivo como artista, sin embargo, Junior H no se suscribe a esto. Saltó a la fama con Atrapado en un sueño en el 2020 y en solo tres años, ha lanzado un total de siete proyectos que no han decepcionado. CONTINGENTE, el álbum más reciente del artista, demuestra que no se limita al ritmo del corrido tradicional ya que está muy influenciado por el trap urbano. Junior H crea música original con toques tradicionales, convirtiéndolo en la estrella más prominente de la música mexicana.

Llena de la postura feminista y la conciencia sociopolítica que han formado una parte central de su trayectoria musical, la cantautora Ileana Cabra Joglar – mejor conocida como iLe — llevó a la audiencia por un recorrido de su último álbum, Nacarile, en la sala del Miracle Theater en Inglewood el pasado 11 de marzo durante la quinta parada de su gira estadounidense en colaboración con KCRW. 
“Estoy super contenta de estar aquí … se vale bailar, hace friíto. Esto no es clima californiano”, comentó sobre la noche inusualmente fría para la región angelina. 
En un ambiente dinámico y a la vez íntimo, comenzando con un set del “time-traveling turntablist”, DJ Ethos, la misma especie de niebla personal y resistencia de Nacarile estuvo presente en el escenario. La intérprete, acompañada por cuatro miembros de su orquesta, presentó un conjunto de 22 canciones en una fusión única de baladas, boleros, salsa y canciones populares repletas de orgullo hacia sus raíces puertorriqueñas.
En varias entrevistas, la vocalista ha explicado que el título de Nacarile fue inspirado por el coloquialismo puertorriqueño que hace referencia a la expresión utilizada para rechazar algo rotundamente. 
En esta última colección de 11 canciones, utiliza esa inspiración para rechazar esas emociones que surgen cuando uno se siente perdido o estancado. Nacarile, entonces, es un viaje de emociones difíciles que también nos lleva a un lugar de crecimiento — algo sinónimo con el espectro de emociones que experimentó la artista al componer el álbum durante el comienzo de la pandemia por el coronavirus y en los talones del movimiento político contra la fallida respuesta de emergencia del gobernador puertorriqueño Ricardo Rosselló tras el paso del huracán María.
“Procesar todo eso al mismo tiempo … me llevaba un poco a nuestra situación colonial, a esa ridiculez por la que todavía estamos sufriendo y no sabemos a dónde vamos a ir”, comentó la cantautora al presentar Donde nadie más respira. “Pensando en eso, pensando en la raíz del problema fue por lo que escribí esta canción”.
Después de esa composición lenta, cargada de sentimientos pesados, iLe cambió el ritmo presentando la distintiva cadencia de Algo bonito. La canción, estilo reguetón recordativa de una marcha militar, fue realizada en colaboración con la distinguida pionera del género, Ivy Queen. A solo días de su presentación en Inglewood, el power dúo estrenó el video que la acompaña. Mientras que su colaboradora no estuvo presente, iLe trascendió el sentido de empoderamiento que la ha convertido en una de las canciones más destacadas de Nacarile. 
“Esta próxima canción la escribí un poco desde una frustración”, comentó frente a una audiencia receptiva. “Pero a veces lo único bueno que pueden traer las frustraciones es que por lo menos para mí se convierten en rabia y en encabronamiento y se convierten en algo bonito”.  
Tomás Rodríguez, un miembro del público que vió por primera vez a la artista en el 2017 en el Younes and Soraya Nazarian Center for the Performing Arts de la Universidad Estatal de California en Northridge, estaba eufórico de tener asientos de primera fila en la presentación.
“Poder ver de cerca a estos artistas independientes aquí en Los Ángeles es muy especial”, dijo. 
Otro miembro de la audiencia, Dina Guerrero, quien ha estado siguiendo el trabajo de iLe desde sus primeros días en Calle 13 y aprecia el estilo único de la artista, manejó desde el área de Moreno Valley para asistir al concierto.
“Me encanta todo lo que hace. Se mantiene fiel a sus raíces y es capaz de mezclar su música con diferentes épocas”, dijo.
Este estilo único y feminista continuó con la canción sombría de su más reciente colección, Cuando te miro, que habla sobre los enrredos de las relaciones tóxicas. 
“Siempre me parecen muy locos los roles que podemos asumir dentro de nuestros géneros y siento que podemos repetir patrones tóxicos de nuestros familiares”, dijo iLe. “El hombre puede asumir ese rol y no saber cómo separarse de sus emociones. La sociedad los ha llevado a no [ser vulnerables] y eso es sumamente injusto”.
Al cierre de la noche, la intérprete cambió el ritmo nuevamente para dejar a la audiencia con un sentido de alivio, regresando a una selección de su segundo álbum y a las raíces afrocaribeñas que influyen su estilo con Curandera. Haciéndole eco al propio espíritu multifacético de la artista, el guitarrista Bayoán Ríos y el baterista Ismael Cancel cambiaron sus instrumentos predilectos por las congas, mientras que el bajista Adalberto Rosario tomó los timbales, invitando así al público a bailar al contagioso ritmo de la bomba.
“Ahora viene la limpieza profunda”, dijo iLe. “Para que salgan sudando un poquito”.

Nunca me ha gustado ver televisión. Siempre me he preguntado por qué necesitaría un televisor cuando tenemos un mundo tan hermoso afuera. 
De pequeña, me encantaba dibujar en la acera con cuantos colores de tiza pudiera, correr con mis hermanos y nadar durante el amanecer y el atardecer. Yo pensaba que ver programas y películas era un gasto de tiempo porque anhelaba explorar el mundo. Sin embargo, llegó un tiempo en el que lo único que quería hacer era ver televisión. 
Cuando era una niña, alrededor de los cuatro o cinco años, veía telenovelas con mi mamá durante los fines de semana. Con mucha admiración, veía cómo personajes femeninos fuertes sustentaban a sus familias, mantenían trabajos difíciles, se enamoraban y tenían vidas complicadas. Le pedía a mi mamá que pausara su programa para poder dibujar los hermosos vestidos de las actrices con mis lápices de colores. Juntas, cantábamos los temas musicales y sonreíamos cada vez que las reconocíamos en la radio. 
Cuando los programas de mi mami terminaban, era mi turno de elegir el siguiente. Sin embargo, no hay muchos programas para los más jóvenes en español. ¿Por qué? Hay programas infantiles en español — en su mayoría programas estadounidenses traducidos al español. Pero entonces, ¿por qué no crear nuestros propios programas en español? 
La televisión en español para los niños es muy importante porque los personajes sirven como ejemplos a seguir. Si bien las historias de princesas amables e intrépidas, príncipes valientes y gentiles, hadas inteligentes y piratas astutos son los clásicos favoritos, carecen de representación en el cine en español. Recuerdo que siempre admiré a la Princesa Bella por su amor eterno por la lectura, el altruismo que mostró para rescatar a su padre y su ciega compasión por la Bestia y la gente del castillo. En consecuencia, cada Halloween me disfrazaba de ella. Sin embargo, también era en parte porque era la única princesa morena que pensaba que se parecía un poco a mí. 
En años recientes, Disney ha comenzado a hacer un esfuerzo por diversificar las culturas en las que centran sus infames mundos cinematográficos. Comenzando con Coco, Elena de Avalor y ahora Encanto, las culturas latinoamericanas han conquistado los programas de Hollywood y los canales de televisión populares. Sin embargo, el progreso en la creación de programas que sumerjan las culturas latinas en su propio idioma sigue siendo muy lento.
En enero de 2023, Disney+ lanzó Gina Yei, un programa de televisión infantil en español que sigue a la becaria Gina mientras persigue su sueño de componer canciones para artistas en el Instituto Musical del Caribe. En una entrevista con La Oficina Geek, Didi Romero, la actriz que interpreta a Gina Yei, reconoció la importancia de que un proyecto de este estilo esté en la plataforma digital de una compañía del calibre de Disney.  
Por su parte, la actriz Ana Wolfermann, quien interpreta a Ruby Rubí en Gina Yei, comparte su experiencia filmando el programa mientras estudiaba en la Universidad de Notre Dame en su cuenta de TikTok. Ambas comparten la importancia de crear mundos que preserven la cultura latina en la televisión para los más jóvenes. Al presentar lugares reconocibles en Puerto Rico y música de reguetón, Disney muestra su progreso no sólo incluyendo la diversidad en la pantalla grande, sino también en celebrándola. Usaron sus recursos para alcanzar a muchísimos niños sin importar la diferencia de idiomas de manera que también sirve para educar a los jóvenes de culturas diferentes. 
Cuando recuerdo las noches viendo telenovelas con mi mami, pienso en todas las mujeres resilientes en sus vestidos lindos. Cuando tenga hijos, quiero que ellos puedan conocer personajes tanto en inglés como en español, fusionando así la cultura estadounidense con la latinoamericana.

“¡Sí se puede!” Es el dicho que los padres expresan cuando sus hijos comienzan su primer año de colegio. Está arraigado en las mentes de los estudiantes que son primera generación universitaria. Sin embargo, aún ante los miles “¡sí se puede!” y “¡échale ganas! confío en ti”, estos estudiantes pueden sentirse tímidos al estar sentados en un salón de clases y levantar la mano con la respuesta a la pregunta del profesor — la respuesta que se repite en sus mentes como una duda pero que siempre fue correcta. 
Ser la primera persona de tu familia en asistir a la universidad viene con el pensamiento constante de que no perteneces. A veces, este sentimiento puede tomar el control, haciéndote perder de vista la realidad. Esto es el síndrome del impostor. El sentimiento es mayormente temporal, por lo que a continuación te presento algunas formas que pudieran ayudarte a romper ese hilo de pensamiento. 
Piensa en hasta donde has llegado 
Saliste hacia adelante por ti mismo, con tu pasión de estudiar y devolverle a la comunidad que te ayudó a crecer. El hecho de que tus padres hayan o no hayan asistido a la universidad no define el éxito, ya que este no se mide con títulos universitarios. La pasión que se lleva dentro es lo que realmente define tus metas y tu éxito. Es esa pasión la que te ha traído hasta aquí y con ese cambio vas a transformar las generaciones futuras. Te desarrollaste a ti mismo, sin necesidad de preguntarle a un familiar. Buscaste lo que no sabías y lo encontraste. 
Tu comunidad confía en ti
Los pensamientos negativos están en tu mente. Lo que percibes como un fallo es una fantasía creada al compararte con alguien más. Piensa en esto al mirar las calles donde creciste y la gente que te ama. Todos están orgullosos de ti. Tu llegada a la universidad tiene valor; todo lo que sufriste valió la pena. 
Los sueños de niñez son ahora una realidad   
Piensa en cuando estabas en la primaria y visualizaste lo que deseabas ser al crecer. Esa niña ha llegado lejos. La versión pequeña de ti estaría orgullosa de donde estás porque una cosa nunca ha cambiado: la pasión y la dedicación con la que trabajas. Tu niña interior está contenta de que diste el paso para ejercer la carrera que hace algunos años era sólo un disfraz. 
Las experiencias superan el aprendizaje académico 
El aprendizaje a través de la experiencia supera el aprendizaje a través de los libros. Las experiencias son lecciones de la vida. Estas brindan conexiones que ningún libro puede demostrar. Por esa razón, no te avergüences de mostrar tus raíces. Ellas te formaron y te trajeron hasta aquí. En este momento, mejor enfócate en hacer crecer las ramas de tu vida. 
Mantén la calma
Todo se logra con calma — no puedes ir con prisa. Por eso, al final del día, todos los graduados van a tener el mismo nombre de la universidad en su diploma. Tú lo vas a lograr. No dejes que los pensamientos negativos tomen el control. Nada es imposible cuando tienes pasión.  
En fin, no estás donde estás por un accidente. Es porque estás cualificado para tu posición. Todo valdrá la pena. Las lágrimas por el estrés y los momentos en que te sientes perdido no son más que lagunas que vas a cruzar y pasos que tienes que dar. No dejes que te detengan. Confío en ti porque estamos abriendo una puerta por la que van a entrar nuestras próximas generaciones.  
El síndrome del impostor es temporal, no es para siempre. Ya has logrado muchísimas cosas; imagina lo que vas a continuar logrando. Ten fe en ti, porque lo más importante es continuar por ti. Sí se puede y no tengas vergüenza de dónde creciste. Esas son tus raíces, las mismas que florecerán con ramilletes de coloridas flores.

In a perfect world, children wouldn’t have to get jobs because their families depended on another source of income to survive. Alas, the reality we find ourselves in doesn’t have that. And in Arkansas, home to the ultimate political nepotism baby Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a law just passed rolling child labor laws to the days when we had kids tinkering with dangerous machinery. Actually, we’re technically still doing that now.
The Arkansas law basically says that children under 16 no longer have to have their age verified before being allowed to work. Hell, they don’t even have to get the Arkansas Division of Labor’s permission, via a work permit. Gov. Sanders’ team said in a statement to NPR that the permit requirement was an “arbitrary burden” on parents. It’s the old “get the government out of my personal life” kind of argument. But don’t be fooled. The new Arkansas law just opens the door for businesses to unscrupulously employ your children — freeing businesses from the requirement of parental consent for 14 or 15 year olds to work. 
What ought to get you is the seemingly automatic responses that supporters of child labor law easements, like this questionable editorial from the Washington Examiner will give, namely that successful adults worked as teenagers, and that teens can now take advantage of a world of work that’s experiencing a “labor shortage”. Pause for a minute and take a walk down memory lane with me.
My first paying job was at a Panera Bread in San Jose in the back of house, making overpriced sandwiches and salads while serving up sous-vide soup (burning myself in the process) for $15.50 an hour, plus tips and single-dollar bills people slid over the counter that I’d split between my other back of house coworkers.
I must have been about 16 or so when I first started working, mainly because I wanted to help pay bills and save for college. I didn’t do it because I wanted character — being poor, Southern and first-generation gave me plenty of that already. No, it was poverty that gave me marching orders to split time between classes and work, and poverty is no doubt the reason why many kids take up work.
That’s not to say I didn’t learn valuable life skills that only a job in food service could teach, but at the cost of doing homework on lunch breaks and getting home at 10 p.m. only to stay up until the wee small hours working on things due the next day? It’s not exactly fair to say that kids will learn and earn from working at younger ages when committing time to work takes away time spent on education and mucks up mental and physical childhood development. I learned that first-hand.
And the argument that children can take advantage of this so-called “labor shortage” for their own benefit? Please excuse me, but there couldn’t be a bigger piece of pig shit in the pig pen. There are people able and willing to work, but the number of jobs that offer a wage you can live on and benefits you can count on is on the decline. Working people are quitting low-paying jobs and finding better ones. The solution for businesses and employers ought to be to take a long look in the mirror and create better jobs now that they’re in a position to attract workers and not the other way around.
However, it seems like the myth of “labor shortages,” taken on its face, makes for a sly cover-up to take advantage of children, who have been historically less likely to strike, paid less and who were easily manipulated. If I didn’t know any better, it would seem as if these arguments in favor of easing current child labor laws are more or less our society’s willingness to maintain the lowest depths of ethical and moral standards in order to keep making profits without changing a thing about how they treat prospective workers.
With states beyond Arkansas, like Ohio and Iowa, considering passing rollbacks on child labor laws of their own, I’m more resolved than ever that the fight for a better future for the next generation ought to have started yesterday. We cannot keep pretending like a nation that strives to be so great can continue to be great when it sleepwalks back into the dark ages.

A few weeks ago I was scrolling through YouTube comments, ignoring looming midterm deadlines, when a particular comment caught my eye. It said something along the lines of: “I was confused why climate change would be a debatable topic. Then I remembered: It’s America.” 
The comment made me sit up. Hasn’t climate change always been controversial, everywhere? For as long as I could remember, the issue had been hounded by millions of dissenting voices. Climate change scientists like Katharine Hayhoe even received death threats from fervent deniers: “Watch out for the big manila [envelopes] … They are usually the craziest,” Hayhoe said in an interview with the New Yorker.
While climate change isn’t necessarily agreed upon outside of the United States, Americans are among the most divided on this issue. Of the 26 nations surveyed by the Pew Research Center in 2019, the U.S. ranked 20th in terms of viewing climate change as a “major threat.” 
What else might I be in the dark about? Was there ever a U.S. that didn’t splinter at the mere mention of a manmade climate crisis?
It turns out that you don’t have to wind back the clock far to find signs of bipartisan acknowledgement of climate change. My favorite discovery was of an extremely awkward commercial featuring Republican former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and Democrat then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi from 2008. Despite the chilly air between them, the pair had actually sat down to talk about the urgency of climate change action. 
According to a Gallup survey conducted in the late nineties, 47% of Republicans and 46% of Democrats believed that global warming had already started, per a Gallup survey. It’s important to look into why discourse so dramatically changed the way it did. 
In a disappointing, but not surprising, reality, money is why environmental conversations between American political parties have soured so greatly. Time magazine writer Justin Worland posits that the energy industry began fighting back against climate change science in the 1970s, when companies would engineer public relations and advertising campaigns, lobby the U.S. government and slash funding from climate research all in an effort to manufacture “the idea that climate science was up for debate.” It worked to a frightening degree. Republican politicians took up the mantle and continued this debate for decades, much to the detriment of our environment.
By 2016, surveys were giving very different results than the ones in the ’90s. Republicans and Democrats seemed especially split on the trustworthiness of climate scientists, as well as the key causes of climate change. In 2016, 70% of liberal Democrats “trust[ed] climate scientists a lot to give full and accurate information about the causes of climate change, compared with just 15% of conservative Republicans,” according to a Pew Research Center survey.
Honestly, some conservative Republicans would rather bury their heads in the sand and ignore the existence of a climate crisis altogether than lose their current way of life by trying to fix it. 
Liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans are sharply divided on the efficacy of any climate change effort that demands individual, political or corporate action. Pew found that a whopping 71% of liberal Democrats agree that “an international agreement to limit carbon emissions … can make a big difference,” whereas only 27% of conservative Republicans felt the same. This large discrepancy persists throughout the survey results, unfortunately. 
As the divide grows and persists, climate change grows along with it.
If you live in the U.S., it can be difficult to start productive conversations about climate change. Fortunately, there are some tips you can use to increase the likelihood of being heard. 
My best advice: The situation isn’t without hope. It’s possible to have successful conversations about climate change. If we could do it back in the ’70s, we can do it now — and it’s imperative that we continue to try. For too long, we’ve simply been shouting over each other. It’s incredibly frustrating and disheartening to debate a topic in which the outcome shapes the quality and longevity of our world. In my experience, what works best is a mixture of patience, persistence, and compassion. Don’t give up, don’t resort to belittling the other side, and try hard to find common ground.

Ser caribeña en USC es como ser un tomate en una canasta de frutas dentro de un mercado de verduras. La comunidad latina y sus organizaciones son la canasta de frutas en la que teóricamente debería sentirme incluida. Sin embargo, esto está muy lejos de la realidad. Aunque en su fachada la Universidad parece valorar a todos sus estudiantes latinos por igual, la mayor parte del tiempo sólo la cultura mexicana — y en ocasiones algunas culturas centroamericanas — es representada.
Una de las razones principales por la que elegí USC fue porque parecía tener una comunidad latina vibrante. No obstante, llegar aquí y ver las organizaciones y los eventos planeados tanto por la Universidad como los clubes fue como tomar un baño de agua fría. Las únicas opciones culinarias en los eventos latinos parecen ser tacos, pupusas, pan dulce y churros. He perdido la cuenta de cuántos eventos incluyen lotería — juego que no entendía hasta que me senté a escribir este artículo. Los invitados especiales para las actividades son en su mayoría mexicanos y, cuando no lo son, se sienten como el token de diversidad latina no mexicana. Por ejemplo, un evento reciente contó con tres panelistas de raíces mexicanas y una colombiana. La falta de balance en representación cultural es evidente.
La situación mejora un poco en el ámbito musical, pero no del todo. Aunque es común escuchar el son caribeño del reguetón en las fiestas de algunas organizaciones latinas, no toma mucho análisis concluir que los allí presentes sólo conocen el reguetón gracias a la fama mundial que ha alcanzado el género tras el éxito sin precedentes de Bad Bunny. Las canciones de Plan B y Don Omar pasan desapercibidas mientras Un verano sin ti es cantado a todo pulmón. Estoy sumamente orgullosa del trabajo que los artistas puertorriqueños han hecho para que el género sea reconocido mundialmente, pero esta discordancia me recuerda que hasta hace algunos años el reguetón — y el vocabulario caribeño en general — eran degradados por el resto de la comunidad latina y clasificados como “español malo”.
Sin embargo, estas fiestas en las que me logro identificar con la música— aunque no del todo — son la única conexión que encuentro con el resto de los latinos en USC. En busca de conexiones latinas, una amiga colombiana y yo intentamos afiliarnos a una sororidad latina. Aunque fui aceptada, decidí no unirme porque entre la mezcla de que la mayoría del capítulo era nacido en Estados Unidos y que sus eventos históricamente revolvían alrededor de culturas centroamericanas, me sentí como una pieza de rompecabezas que no encajaba. Aunque estaba rodeada de latinas, no tuve sentido de pertenencia alguno.
Durante el Mes de la Herencia Latina pasado, una de las organizaciones latinas más populares creó una serie de publicaciones en Instagram sobre los distintos países latinoamericanos. Mi emoción ante la representación de otros países, sin embargo, duró muy poco. Uno de los datos que se incluía en la publicación era la fecha de independencia del país. Al llegar el turno de Puerto Rico, el autor no hizo más esfuerzo que una búsqueda de tres segundos en Google — y si te lo estás preguntando, sí, hice el ejercicio — para concluir que nuestra fecha de independencia es el 4 de julio. Puerto Rico es una colonia de EE. UU. y por tanto no tenemos fecha de independencia. Aunque la organización luego hizo otra publicación rectificandose y explicando brevemente nuestra situación colonial, esto no borró el sabor amargo del error cometido una de las pocas veces que me he sentido representada en la Universidad.
No quiero que se me malinterprete. Entiendo que, entre las poblaciones latinas de USC, la mexicana es la más grande por razones geográficas y sociopolíticas. Entiendo que, por tanto, esta comunidad esté mejor representada que América del Sur y el Caribe. Sin embargo, las organizaciones deberían reconocer que esta brecha en representación es significativamente mayor de lo que proporcionalmente debería ser y trabajar para disminuirla. No digo que la Universidad o sus organizaciones jamás hayan hecho eventos que incluyan elementos sudamericanos, pero son raros e infrecuentes. No se debería anunciar una diversidad entre culturas latinas que apenas existe. 
Si como latinos exigimos más representación en los medios de comunicación, debemos primero trabajar en nuestra diversidad intracultural. No se puede denunciar a Hollywood por presentar la comunidad latina como un monolito cuando las organizaciones latinas en una institución con la visibilidad de USC manejan la comunidad latina como un monolito. El hecho de que todos seamos latinos no significa que compartimos la misma cultura. De hecho, es precisamente la diversidad cultural lo que hace a Latinoamérica tan rica. No hay razón alguna por la que los eventos latinos deban presentar la misma comida, por ejemplo, cuando hay tantos platillos para escoger.
Durante este año escolar he sido bendecida con un grupo de amigos latinocaribeños increíble con los que momentáneamente me siento en casa. Nos reunimos y podemos comer arroz con habichuelas y tostones mientras escuchamos salsa o reguetón viejito. Sin embargo, esto inevitablemente me lleva a pensar en cuán bonito sería tener eventos en los que estemos mejor representados y en los que podamos conectar desde nuestras diversidades. En una ciudad en la que raramente me siento representada, quisiera que las organizaciones latinas de  la universidad a la que decidí asistir por lo menos hicieran un intento de incluir mi cultura.

Let’s set the record straight: Daisy Jones & the Six is a fictional band, but they’re dominating real-world charts. It’s what makes for the unique viewing experience that is the rock ‘n’ roll odyssey “Daisy Jones & the Six,” Amazon’s ten-episode miniseries adapted from the namesake novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid. Part docu-style, part narrative drama, topped off with a companion album “Aurora” stacked with genuinely good songs cover to cover, “Daisy Jones & the Six” feels more real than it doesn’t.
Conceptually, Reid’s novel demanded itself to be made into something visual and audible. The novel includes a full length catalog of “Aurora” lyrics, and the book cover — a young woman’s face lost in a hurricane of ginger curls — begs the question: Who is this girl? For fans of the book, the series devotes itself to maintaining a considerable degree of accuracy to its source material — well, except that the aforementioned “Six” is moreso “the Five,” hence a missing band member, but there’s a sweet workaround. Despite some major changes, Amazon’s adaption doesn’t hinder its predecessor; it lives up to it, enhancing a story that was always meant to be taken off the page.
Twenty years following the group’s final performance, the estranged band members are gathered for a tell-all documentary to give their accounts of the group’s rise to fame in the 1970’s rock scene, the monumental recording sessions behind “Aurora” and to reveal the details of their split. The band’s history is mainly framed around the explosive feud between lead singers Daisy Jones (Riley Keough) and Billy Dunne (Sam Claflin), but as other members chime in, the backstage drama proves more eventful than just their quarrels.
Backing up Dunne and Jones is the loveable ensemble that includes lead guitarist Graham Dunne (Will Harrison), keyboardist Karen Sirko (Suki Waterhouse), bassist Eddie Roundtree (Josh Whitehouse), drummer Warren Rojas (Sebastian Chacon) and Camilla Dunne (Camila Moronne), wife to Billy and the band’s key non-musical member. In switching back and forth between their younger and wiser selves, the show cultivates an intimately authentic look at the band that makes them feel more human than mythological.
“Daisy Jones & the Six” lends itself to the Mount Rushmore of rock legends, taking clear inspiration from the inter-band dynamics of Fleetwood Mac. The rock ‘n’ roll mythos does come with the cost of its tropes, caricatures and appetite for nostalgia, but “Daisy Jones & the Six” still manages to find its legs with an original story while paying tribute to the seventies zeitgeist. 
The series does more than just reflect on the dreamland that was the Los Angeles music scene, but takes viewers to where it all really happened — from the Whiskey a Go Go to Sound City — and enhances these places with glamorous production design, costumes and hair and makeup to fully realize a world many can only imagine experiencing. The atmosphere runs deep in the lyricism of “Aurora,” and it truly comes to life through its perfectly casted ensemble. 
The show’s biggest success is Keough’s outstanding performance as Daisy Jones, a role that might as well have been made for the actress, whose scrappy demeanor harmonizes perfectly with Claflin’s gritty charm. But it’s Morrone’s graceful performance as Camila Dunne that is the beating heart of the show — and easily breaks the heart. While the other “Six” actors could have been spared more time to explore their characters in the earlier episodes, they each make memorable impressions by the series finale to complete the picture.
The series kicks off before Daisy Jones and the members of the Six were joined by the “&” in their name. In the late ‘60s, Daisy Jones is a neglected teen finding her voice on the psychedelic Sunset Strip, but finds herself being creatively taken advantage of. She closes herself off to the prospect of performing, but with the encouragement of her ride-or-die best friend Simone Jackson (Nabiyah Be), a fellow musician and rising disco star, Daisy begins to realize her own creative potential.
In Pittsburg, brothers Billy and Graham Dunne play casual gigs with their friends, including future “Six” members Eddie and Warren, as “The Dunne Brothers.” They’re a local hit, and following a chance encounter with band manager Rod Reyes (Timothy Olyphant), they look West to the bustling L.A. rock scene to chase their dreams. But the spark that really ignites the passion behind the music is the young love of Billy and Camila, who decide to hit the road together.
Despite his undying devotion to his wife, Billy’s struggle with drinking and the inebriety of a rocker persona is just the first trial of their relationship. So when the free-spirited Daisy later enters the picture, Billy’s commitment to becoming a better person is put under even greater pressure. Keough and Claflin have a searing chemistry that embodies a suppressed temptation — not just for the intoxication of drugs and alcohol, but for each other.
In the unforgiving world of rock ‘n’ roll, the musicians’ lives prove to be as delicate as their art. “Daisy Jones & the Six” understands that fame and relevance are mortal instruments, so it makes the most of what plays out to be a tragically short-lived affair. The music will never die, but what lingers most after Daisy Jones & the Six exit the building is an unforgettable story about a band that can say they really did it all.

From interviewing genocide survivors to award-winning photographers to educators from around the world, Rachael Cerrotti never imagined all the beautiful and inspirational conversations that would come out of her podcast “The Memory Generation,” sponsored by the USC Shoah Foundation. 
Cerrotti’s fascination with memory and storytelling emerged from her relationship with her grandmother, a Holocaust survivor. Embarking on a 10-year journey to retrace her grandmother’s war story, Cerrotti transformed her research into the Shoah Foundation’s first ever podcast: a one-of-a-kind narrative series based on a Holocaust survivor’s testimony titled “We Share the Same Sky.” 
Impressed by Cerrotti’s “eloquent” and “vivid” approach towards her grandmother’s story, Stephen Smith, the co-founder of Storyfile and the former executive director of the Shoah Foundation, started discussing ideas for a second podcast, leading them into conversation about the cross-cultural and intergenerational power of memory. 
“[Stephen] and I [are] collaborators, friends and colleagues, [who] started getting into conversations about … [how] memory is just so fascinating, how memory is fallible, how memory gets passed down in these different ways and how we create it,” Cerrotti said. “And so the memory generation just grew out of those conversations.” 
Entering the Shoah Foundation in 2021 as their inaugural Storyteller in Residence, Cerrotti had access to the Foundation’s extensive archive, which included over 55,000 testimonies from genocide survivors from all over the world. Through the medium of a podcast, Cerrotti and Smith wanted to not only highlight the voices within this archive but also reflect on how these diverse stories make us think about our own lives and everyday decisions.
But, before they delved into the process of creating this podcast, Cerrotti and Smith had to determine what exactly was “the memory generation.”
“Initially, we’d seen [memory as] … being handed [down],” said Smith, who helped co-produce the podcast. “But then we realized, we’re actually a generation for whom memory is being created in real time. It’s not so much as memory being dusty photo album[s] that we’ve dug out of a drawer. Memory is real from the moment it happens … Memory is at the heart of our identity. In fact, really, what we are is a series of memories.”
Instead of relying solely on archival testimonies from genocide survivors, Cerrotti also branched out and interviewed storytellers, who shared how intergenerational memories played a role in shaping their worldview. 
“[I had] the freedom to explore … how [these archives and these voices] can create connections with other people. So looking at how memory plays into our worlds, whether you’re coming from Vietnam, from Armenia, from Jewish history, or maybe it has nothing to do with your ethnic background,” Cerrotti said. “[The podcast] was really this wonderful way to let the archive inspire other conversations, which I think is the best thing then archive can do.”
One of the interviews that inspired Sedda Antekelian, Shoah Foundation’s education and outreach specialist on the Armenian Genocide, was episode seven. Here, Cerrotti interviews Armenian filmmaker Naré Mkrtchyan while Smith presents the testimony of Armin Wegner, a German solider who witnessed and documented the 1915 Armenian Genocide as well as the Holocaust despite facing imprisonment. 
Broaching on topics of intergenerational trauma as well as citizens’ responsibility to spread awareness about mass atrocities, Cerrotti and Smith curated a narrative that encouraged Antekelian to reflect on her identity as a fourth-generation descendant of genocide survivors as well as an educator.
“Intergenerational trauma is a reminder of our responsibility to make the world aware and to continue to share the memory of those that were lost and unknown. We are witnesses to history. So we must discover our own sense of responsibility,” Antekelian said. “That’s what stood out when [Mktrchyan and Cerrotti] speak about what it means to be a descendant … It just deepens my own connection to who I am and who I represent.” 
Crafting in-depth conversations and segments for “The Memory Generation,” Cerrotti had to confront the delicate and often painful nature of memories. Yet, Cerrotti maintains a hopeful note within the podcast, as specifically seen in the episode where she interviews Betty Grebenschikoff, a Holocaust survivor who reunited with her childhood best friend after being separated for 82 years. This conversation helps both Cerrotti and the audience witness the beauty and joy that can emerge from unpacking even the most difficult memories.
“[We were] having a conversation that was rooted in genocide, Holocaust separation, war, immigration, displacement and all of these really big heavy ideas and realities, but then the conversation [was also about] what [Betty] remembered about her childhood and she talked about her grandmother’s potato soup, and how wonderful it was to meet her best friend again,” Cerrotti said. “While being rooted in something really scary and dangerous … exploring memory eventually get[s] [you] to a place where your reflections have a lot of nuance and texture.” 
Ending the season by revisiting memories of her grandmother with her cousin, Cerrotti sets an example of how the stories we inherit can initiate insightful conversations that help us not only reflect on the memories that define us but also build upon our capacity for empathy.  
“Empathy is not an emotion, empathy is a skill … You can learn the skill of empathy by listening more deeply to others, which is really what it’s all about,” Smith said.
While plans for season two still remain undecided as Cerrotti pursues other projects, she hopes that the first season of the “The Memory Generation” highlights the capacity we all have to make a change simply through the conversations and memories we share with each other. 
“I hope that [this podcast] inspires [audiences] to not just talk to their own family, but also to look at their friends and peers. And remember that … everyone is carrying and holding a lot of history, a lot of nuance, and a lot of reflection,” Cerrotti said.
