Twenty-four massive ionic columns made of Italian marble lined the Court Chamber of the Supreme Court of the United States. Two American flags flew proudly at each end of a long bench, at which the nine Supreme Court justices sat in their signature black robes. Over the decades, the building has heard arguments of historic cases that forge the rules that govern the nation.
The year was 2009, and a fresh-faced lawyer appeared behind the central lectern in the courtroom.
“Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.” 
Lindsay Harrison’s voice was steady — loud, confident. As if she’d done this a hundred times before.
But she hadn’t. This was her first oral argument as a lawyer in any court. Harrison was 30 — just five-and-a-half years out of law school and nine years after graduating with her bachelor’s degree from USC. 
She won the case. It was a landmark case in immigration law that set the standard that asylum seekers will not be removed from the United States while their cases await judicial review.
Now, Harrison is working on an ongoing court case against President Donald Trump for his executive order on immigration in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. At the end of March, USC joined 30 other research institutions to file an amicus brief in the case.
But Harrison’s day-to-day work is far more chaotic that one might think for a constitutional litigator.
On a given day, she could be writing a brief, talking through arguments and strategy or participating in a moot court to prepare for arguments. She could be talking to her clients, many of whom include high-profile businesses and hospitality companies. But for her pro bono practice, she could also be found at an immigration detention center meeting with a client to see how she can help them get asylum. Or she could be at a prison with a death penalty defendant talking about their appeal. 
It sounds like a lot.
“Yes, it’s really fun, that’s the thing,” Harrison said with a laugh.
A love for learning
“Fun” isn’t the word you would expect to describe the work of a Supreme Court and appellate lawyer. But Harrison, who graduated from USC in 2000, is an intellectual explorer. 
“The great thing about being an appellate lawyer is that every day brings with it a whole new world to learn,” Harrison said.
Harrison has always had this mindset. On a debate scholarship at USC, Harrison studied political science, gender studies and film took Thematic Option classes and participated in the Judicial Council in Undergraduate Student Government. She eventually graduated from USC summa cum laude with honors. In some ways, her path to Harvard Law School, where she graduated in 2003, was inevitable.
“A lot of my political science classes had constitutional law or something legal to them, and those were among my favorite classes,” Harrison said. “I was pretty sure I was destined for law school.”
And yet, her professors at USC don’t remember her as an archetypal pre-law student. Howard Gillman, her former political science professor and now the chancellor of University of California, Irvine, didn’t have preconceptions of what Harrison would end up doing with her life and career.
“I assumed she would treat law school the same way she treated her undergraduate career,” Gillman said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “[A]s an adventure, where the path would reveal itself in the course of the experience.”
That idea of intellectual adventure colors much of Harrison’s approach to her studies at USC. 
“She was curious about everything,” said Thomas Habinek, her former classics professor.
That curiosity goes hand-in-hand with passion, something that Harrison learned from her USC professors. She admired the enthusiasm that Tara McPherson, her former critical studies professor who has written four books and is working on a fifth, had for her work in academia. 
“She taught me that your career can be fun,” Harrison said.
From USC to SCOTUS
At USC, Harrison got to engage in interdisciplinary thinking, exploring new fields and applying ideas across disciplines. In some ways, that’s not too different from what she does today. In Thematic Option, for example, students are required to build a depth of knowledge on a new topic in just one semester. Working on a new appeals case takes the same intellectual process.
“When you take on a new appeal,” Harrison said, “you’re looking at new industry or new area of the law — you have to learn it relatively quickly and you have to learn it in a degree of depth.”
Harrison also remembers the impact McPherson’s class on feminist media had on her.
“She taught me to read culture with a critical eye in a way that I hadn’t thought of before,” Harrison said. “I definitely use those skills as a lawyer when I’m reading a brief and thinking about the arguments.” 
In law school, including her time as executive technical editor of the Harvard Women’s Law Journal and the executive articles editor of the Harvard Civil Rights – Civil Liberties Law Review, Harrison explored this intersection of gender and law that she first learned about in critical studies. In one of her law review articles, she explored how the male gaze — a concept in film that posits men as viewers and women as objects — frames discussion in the law about rape.
Harrison’s time at USC wasn’t just limited to the classroom. Her voracious appetite for learning was met by a deep desire to improve her campus community — during the late 1990s and early 2000s, in which activism at USC was rare.
“In an earlier period when fewer students at USC were engaged in that kind of activism, Lindsay already thought of herself as someone who had political agency in the world,” McPherson said.
McPherson remembered that at USC, Harrison worked on political campaigns on campus, organized for LGBT rights and worked on Take Back the Night, an event to empower sexual assault survivors that remains a USC tradition.
Looking ahead
Today, Harrison’s passion for bettering the community manifests in her work at Jenner & Block LLP, a firm widely recognized for its pro bono practice. That’s why Harrison, who expected that she would have left a big law firm like Jenner & Block for a nonprofit organization by this point, is still there.
“It was very important to me that my career allow me to contribute to the public interest,” Harrison said. “Both because I feel it’s important to contribute to advancing civil rights and constitutional law and because I find it intellectually interesting.”
Remembering her first oral argument, Harrison has the kind of maturity that allows her to appreciate the magnitude of the consequences of her work.
“Not only does history rest on your shoulders,” Harrison said, “but also in my case thousands of immigrants who had come to this country seeking asylum and were dependent on the United States not deporting them while their cases were being heard. It’s a huge responsibility.”
For someone whose work has touched so many lives, Harrison doesn’t tout her accomplishments. That attitude speaks to her confidence that is bold — but not loud.
“She exemplified how brilliance is most naturally associated with modesty rather than certainty,” Gillman said. “When those traits are combined with someone who had such a charming, idiosyncratic manner and unique sense of humor, you have the ingredients for becoming an unforgettable student.” 
And yet, her goal — to forge a real impact on the lives of many, to change the history that will rest on the shoulders of the next generation — keeps her going. It drives her obvious, brazen commitment to her career, and to her life.
“She’s pretty fearless,” McPherson said. “To show up at a door of a professor’s  apartment just to say hi — there’s no kind of shyness or hesitancy there.”
Harrison’s fearlessness is unmistakable. She speaks with the confidence of an intellectual risk-taker — someone who is so resolute in her purpose that she approaches her work with an unstoppable tenacity.
That’s the attitude that she is adopting toward her current case, the litigation against Trump for his executive order.
“That you have the power to impact that many lives is a huge, humbling experience,” Harrison said. “But it’s why I went to law school.”

When Joël Perez walked into a meeting with the leaders of the project to expand the USC Health Sciences Campus, he was expecting a productive discussion where he would have the opportunity to voice his concerns. Instead Perez, the communications manager for Boyle Heights Building Healthy Communities, was greeted with PowerPoint presentations explaining the plans for increased construction and development, and he walked out feeling frustrated and unheard. 
The expansion proposals include a new healthcare center to open in January 2018, along with a new campus hospital. New dorms, parking structures, a hotel and additional biotechnology labs are also expected to be added. The project is estimated to take 10 years or longer. 
Cynthia Strathmann is the executive director of Strategic Actions for a Just Economy, a nonprofit that aims to combat gentrification and focuses on tenant rights, healthy housing and equitable development, according to the organization’s website. Strathmann said that the expansions would precipitate negative repercussions, disrupting and uprooting the lives of the community residents. 
“What we have noticed about university expansions is that they can often lead to direct or indirect displacement of longtime standing residents if measures aren’t taken to ensure that this does not happen,” Strathmann said. 
Thomas Jackiewicz, senior vice president and CEO of the USC Keck School of Medicine, explained that the developments would ultimately prove to be beneficial for the community in the long run, as the new structures would provide job opportunities and technological upgrades to the area. 
“I always think the opportunity to create new job opportunities for the community is important,” Jackiewicz said. “I also think that when you add healthcare facilities in the community, you create access to and bring in state-of-the-art healthcare locally. It’s a real plus for the community. It’s really a local asset as well.” 
Some members of the community surrounding HSC have disagreed with  the planned expansions, fearing that the construction would accelerate the gentrification process. Members of the Boyle Heights community formed a Health Innovation Community Partnership in the hopes of increasing transparency and opening up a more direct line of communication with the USC project supervisors. 
Perez, who participated in the HICP initiative, stressed the importance of including the community in negotiations in order to ensure that their interests would be not steamrolled by developers. 
“The community needs to have a seat at the table,” Perez said. “They need to be meaningfully engaged with any proposed developments taking place. The voice of the community needs to be heard and considered.” 
Strathmann emphasized that residents should be more assertive in assuring that they would be adequately compensated.  The benefits of the expansions should ultimately outweigh the costs for the affected inhabitants.
“The community needs to feel entitled to make demands on developers,” Strathmann said. “If they’re going to benefit from developing that area, the tenants, residents, homeowners and business owners who have made that area vibrant and desirable must be able to share in the prosperity that comes with development.” 
Jackiewicz vowed that the community would be closely involved in the process and that their needs and concerns would be taken into serious consideration, assuring that USC was endeavoring to keep open as many lines of communication as possible. 
“We have community advisory committee meetings,” Jackiewicz said. “We meet with some of the community leaders here on campus and we have lunch with them. We talk about what our plans are and we try to get direct feedback from those folks as well.” 
Perez, however, felt that the attempts made by USC were meager and that the community’s concerns were brushed off. He said that in many of these meetings, USC leaders dominated with prepared presentations, setting the tone immediately and leaving little room for discussion or compromise. 
“They’ve had a few community gatherings that were not meaningful,” Perez said. “Presentations, a while back, and it felt like that was the checkmark for USC as far as, ‘Oh we’ve done our community engagement.’ There needs to be more dialogue. We need to be included.” 
Jackiewicz said that the University had the community’s best interests in mind and believed that USC should be regarded as a member rather than an outsider. 
“We’re working really closely with our community relations group to really hear the community,” Jackiewicz said. “We want to make sure that we hear the community, that we address their needs and bring the resources that we can to improve the lives of the people that live around us. We are part of this community.” 
As the expansion plans progress, Perez hopes that USC will make an increased effort to listen to the community members as well as allow them to be more involved in the process. 
“USC has not done a good job listening, and they haven’t done a good job being transparent,” Perez said. “It’s county land. It’s land that impacts this neighborhood. You need to reframe that. You need to listen to us.”

USC has always been an incredibly good neighbor in its surrounding communities.  The truth is that USC has never been the “ousider” because USC has been present in both the University/Exposition Park and Boyle Heights neighborhoods since they developed.  There is a strong argument to be made that those communities would be invisible and forgotten corners of the city if it were not for USC’s presence.  Few private entities go to the lengths that USC does to give back to the communities around it.  The concerns of community members should be heard and considered, but USC should also ensure that it is not taken advantage of, like it was in building the USC VIllage at the main campus… where community organizations (often funded and empowered by outside interests) were successful in extorting the University for money and other favours that far exceeded anything owed to the community.
Ridiculous. “fearing that the construction would accelerate the gentrification process”…You mean MAKING IT SAFER?? RAISING PROPERTY VALUES?? I almost agree with her though, Boyle Heights doesn’t deserve this…because they’re too stupid to know how lucky they are.
The community surrounding the USC health science campus want the university to function like a Black African university or a Banana Republic university without much advancement.  In fact, the real estate values of the houses in the neighborhood would increase with the excellent university projects coming to fruition.   The local community wants an uneducated environment around the campus.  Such an attitude does not augur well for the progress of the nation as a whole.

The football team reached the culmination of the spring ball portion of its offseason this Saturday when it played its annual Spring Game. In front of a reported 14,781 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Trojans participated in a situationally focused scrimmage that put the team in game-specific scenarios. 
The spring game opened up with a 7-on-7 pass-rush drill, which was followed by a run-pass option period, a “backed-up” offensive situation, an “open field, move the ball” period and a red zone drill between the offense and defense. There was no score kept for the game. 
USC ran a total of 62 offensive plays Saturday, combining the situational and live-play sequences. The Trojans also gave redshirt freshman kicker Michael Brown the opportunity to kick seven field goal attempts (he converted on five of them, including a 50-yarder). 
On the day, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold completed four of six passing attempts for a total of 58 yards. During the offense’s “backed up” period, Darnold made an impressive play, escaping the pocket, rolling out to his right before connecting with redshirt freshman receiver Velus Jones for 21 yards down the sideline. 
“Last year [in the spring], I know that I was competing with Max [Browne] for the starting sport, and that made me a whole lot better,” Darnold said. “This year though, I’ve needed to do a better job of competing with myself to make myself better. It’s something I know I can do, and I need to get better at [competing with myself]. That’s been the key takeaway from this spring.” 
Also throwing the ball for the Trojans were redshirt freshman quarterback Matt Fink and early enrollee Jack Sears. The two are currently locked in a battle for the team’s backup quarterback role, and both had the opportunity to lead the offense through game-specific situations. 
Fink finished the day with 47 passing yards total, connecting on five of nine pass attempts. On the first play of the red zone period, Fink connected with redshirt freshman receiver Tyler Vaughns for a 20-yard passing score. This was the only passing touchdown thrown by any quarterback. 
Sears completed three of seven pass attempts for 32 yards on Saturday. Throughout the spring game, Sears put his mobility on display. Rolling out to his right, Sears was able to escape pressure and connect with redshirt freshman receiver Jake Russell for 13 yards. 
“I thought that both [Fink and Sears] did a nice job,” head coach Clay Helton said. “I’m impressed with [Fink’s] overall spring. It was really neat to see [Sears] in this situation. I mean, he should be at prom right now and he’s at the Coliseum throwing the ball around, getting it to the right places.  Both kids did a nice job today of getting it to the right guy.”
Expected to be the leading workhorse for this Trojans running back corps, junior Ronald Jones II carried the ball four times Saturday for a total of eight yards. 
The Trojans’ top performer out of the tailback slot was redshirt freshman running back Vavae Malepeai. Rushing for 36 yards on eight carries, Malepeai showed impressive vision in the open field Saturday, as he was able to break off several longer runs. Malepeai, who had his freshman season cut short due to a shoulder blade injury, had the longest rush of the day from a running back with 14 yards. 
Redshirt junior fullback Reuben Peters recorded the only rushing touchdown off of a 6-yard score. 
The Trojans’ leading receiver was redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns, who finished the game with three receptions for 48 yards. Vaughns also had the only touchdown reception of the game, which was thrown by Fink.
Another notable wideout for USC was sophomore Michael Pittman, who reeled in three catches for 30 receiving yards. Pittman and Vaughns both notched significant receptions during the “backed-up” period in which the Trojan offense was forced to operate deep in its own territory, starting from its own 2-yard line.
Working with the first team defense on Saturday was freshman early enrollee defensive tackle Marlon Tuipulotu. With four tackles, including one for a loss, Tuipulotu was one of the bright spots for the USC defense throughout the game. Other Trojans with four tackles defensively included junior linebacker Cameron Smith and redshirt senior safety Matt Lopes.
Sophomore defensive end Oluwole Betiku Jr. mirrored Tuipulotu’s defensive production, as he finished Saturday with four tackles, one resulting in a loss of yardage for the offense.
The defense was able to put together a clean showing on Saturday, as they committed no penalties for the entirety of the spring game. The USC offense was called for three penalties during the game.
“I was very pleasantly pleased with the defense,” Helton said. “How they performed, how they communicated. They just look like they’re playing incredibly fast right now. What I’ve really been impressed by is that, not just our ones, but our twos are looking very solid.”
Members of the 2016-2017 men’s basketball team were honored during the game at the Coliseum for their recent 26-win season, the most in school history. Additionally, USC’s 2016 football team was presented with their Rose Bowl rings and members of the Trojans’ 2017 recruiting class were also in attendance and announced to fans. 
Following the conclusion of the spring game, several USC players and coaches remained at the Coliseum to meet with fans and sign autographs.

Despite serving No. 1 Long Beach State’s one of only three total losses on the season in January, the men’s volleyball team was not able to pull off the upset on Saturday in the first round of the MPSF Tournament. The Trojans saw their season end after taking the second set and finishing the rest of the sets within 3, 7 and 2 points. 
“I think we played really well the entire match,” senior middle blocker Andy Benesh said. “I’m not sure what they hit tonight but I’m sure it’s not on par with what they usually hit. And we dug it past really well so we gave ourselves a chance.” 
Senior outside hitter Lucas Yoder, who was named to the 2017 MPSF First Team last week, notched a match-high 23 kills, but even that was not enough for the Trojans to clinch a victory. The sets themselves were close, but Long Beach State finished with eight aces and 11.5 blocks as USC earned zero aces and only five blocks. 
In the first set, the Trojans were neck-and-neck with Long Beach State until a 4-point run put the 49ers out of reach to end the set at 25-22. USC out-hit them in both total number and in percentage.
For the second set, USC fell behind early, but they brought the set to a tie at 22-22 and finished with both a hit and a Long Beach State hitting error to take the set 26-24. Again, they out-hit the 49ers with 17-12 total kills and hit .225 to their .179, but it was Long Beach State’s passing that helped clinch it in the end as they had 19 digs in the second set alone.
Even with the momentum in favor of USC going into the third set, Long Beach State came out strong to take a 7-2 lead that it would never relinquish. The Trojans could not regain the momentum that had propelled them through to the end of the second set. In part, this was due to the 49ers having only one hitting error and four aces in the set alone.
From the beginning of the fourth set, it seemed that Long Beach State was going to take it. It carried through most of the set, with the 49ers being ahead 21-17 at one point. However, as in the second set, the Trojans managed to make a comeback and bring it to 22-all. But it wasn’t enough, ending the team’s season.
After not even making the tournament last year, the team doubled its total wins to finish the season 14-14. While the end of the tournament run means the end of Trojan volleyball for the five seniors, the progression from last year leaves hope for the future of this team.
“We fought the entire time,” senior outside hitter Christopher Orenic said. “These young guys have a lot of heart, and I can’t wait to see what they do next season and the following season. They have a lot of talent, and this is going to be a good team.”

Senior outside hitter Lucas Yoder, who was named to the 2017 MPSF First Team last week, notched a match-high 23 kills, but even that was not enough for the Trojans to clinch a victory. The sets themselves were close, but Long Beach State finished with eight aces and 11.5 blocks as USC earned zero aces and only five blocks. 
In the first set, the Trojans were neck-and-neck with Long Beach State until a 4-point run put the 49ers out of reach to end the set at 25-22. USC out-hit them in both total number and in percentage.
For the second set, USC fell behind early, but they brought the set to a tie at 22-22 and finished with both a hit and a Long Beach State hitting error to take the set 26-24. Again, they out-hit the 49ers with 17-12 total kills and hit .225 to their .179, but it was Long Beach State’s passing that helped clinch it in the end as they had 19 digs in the second set alone.
Even with the momentum in favor of USC going into the third set, Long Beach State came out strong to take a 7-2 lead that it would never relinquish. The Trojans could not regain the momentum that had propelled them through to the end of the second set. In part, this was due to the 49ers having only one hitting error and four aces in the set alone.
From the beginning of the fourth set, it seemed that Long Beach State was going to take it. It carried through most of the set, with the 49ers being ahead 21-17 at one point. However, as in the second set, the Trojans managed to make a comeback and bring it to 22-all. But it wasn’t enough, ending the team’s season.
After not even making the tournament last year, the team doubled its total wins to finish the season 14-14. While the end of the tournament run means the end of Trojan volleyball for the five seniors, the progression from last year leaves hope for the future of this team.
“We fought the entire time,” senior outside hitter Christopher Orenic said. “These young guys have a lot of heart, and I can’t wait to see what they do next season and the following season. They have a lot of talent, and this is going to be a good team.”
Losing Yoder and Benesh for next season hurts big time. Need major help from new freshmen. Obviously fought hard,
but results are what counts on the scoreboard. Zero service aces with 16 service errors is not going to get it done.
Team is a long way from the top half of the conference teams. Beating the likes of Sacred Hearts, Concordia, Harvard,
UCSD and Cal Baptist makes your record look decent, but doesn’t take you to the next level. One more year for Coach Nygaard to make a major move with team or be gone unless AD Swann cuts the cord now.

Another spring football season is in the books for the Trojan Football program, and the future of the program is as bright as it has been in the last decade. In addition to having a wunderkind under center, the Trojans are continuing to stockpile depth and talent as they are finally recovering from the cost of the 2010 NCAA sanctions.
The last decade has crowned two types of championship teams. One is a team led by a singular talent at quarterback, who carries an already talented and athletic team to the next level. This is how Auburn with Cam Newton, Florida State with Jameis Winston and Clemson with Deshaun Watson all won national titles. The other model is a deep and talented team with a vicious running game and stifling defense, like most of the Alabama teams that have won as well as Ohio State the year they won the national title.
Both types of teams were stocked with tremendous talent across the board. Florida State, Auburn and Clemson were all littered with NFL prospects across a multitude of positions. It is not that the quarterback was the only star — it was that Newton, Winston and Watson were so transcendent that their moxie and dynamic ability made the team unbeatable. 
Having a star quarterback or an equally frightening defense is the only way to beat Alabama. The Crimson Tide is not accustomed to dealing with excellent quarterback play in the SEC, so when they face NFL-caliber talent, they are more likely to surrender yards and touchdowns. That was evident with Watson last year, and other incredible performances from the signal caller position have taken down the Tide in seasons past.
The good news about this model for Trojan fans is that USC has the best quarterback in college football. It is nice to see redshirt sophomore Sam Darnold finally receive the praise and hype he deserves. I was on the Darnold for Heisman campaign after watching his brief series at the end of the Stanford game, and his performances against Utah and Arizona State only solidified that belief. Each game he seemed to improve, and this spring has been another step up in his linear growth.
Many point to the offensive line as a potential weak spot this next year due to the loss of three talented veteran linemen. However, if a normal quarterback was behind center last season, the Trojans would have had a pedestrian offensive line at best. Darnold evaded defenders constantly, making something out of nothing four or five plays a game. There is no reason to think this won’t happen again next season, demonstrating Darnold’s penchant for making everyone better around him.
If Darnold can stay healthy all season, the Trojans should not lose a single game. Battling a Texas team led by Tom Herman might pose a challenge early on in the season, but across the board the Trojans have the chance to have a special season next year.
In addition to Darnold, they have an abundance of talent at the skill positions, which is only further amplified by the quarterback’s ability to spread the ball around. The defense is going to be fast and physical at every level, and while they may give up some big plays, they also should force some turnovers next season.
It is crazy to say only a year removed from an awful beat down at the hands of Alabama, but with Darnold at the helm, the Trojans can play with anyone. As long as he plays all year, I think the Trojans end the season as the national champion. It would not be a shock for scouts and pundits to start calling Darnold a generational talent, which he is. With the right talent around players like him, teams win titles. Spring is only a small sample size, but it looks like the Trojans might follow the model for next season.

In a hard-fought defensive bout between two of the top five teams in the nation, the No. 2 women’s water polo team found its offensive spark in the second half to come from behind and defeat No. 5 Cal 6-3 in a key MPSF match-up on Saturday at the Spieker Aquatics Complex in Berkeley, Calif. With the road victory, USC improves to 26-1 on the season with a 4-1 mark in conference play, while Cal falls to 14-7 overall and 2-4 in the MPSF.
The Trojans, who were just coming off their first loss after 53 games last weekend against top-ranked Stanford, were engaged in a battle from the start against a pesky Golden Bears squad. For the third consecutive game, USC fought back from an early deficit, as the home team struck first thanks to Cal’s Anna Illes. However, a back-and-forth defensive display kept the score at 1-0 at the end of the first frame. The Trojans got on the board in the middle of the second period thanks to senior 2-meter Brigitta Games, who blasted a shot past Cal goalie Madeline Trabucco to even the score at 1-1. Once again, both defenses would not let up as the score remained tied at the end of the first half.
USC finally turned on the jets on the offensive end in the third quarter. Freshman utility Maud Megens earned a big power play for USC to set up a score by senior driver Ioanna Haralabidis, putting USC ahead 2-1. Just moments later, Megens broke through with back-to-back goals to push USC’s lead to three at 4-1. On a 6-on-5 opportunity, Games then took a pass from Haralabidis to rifle in a shot and score to cap a 4-0 scoring run in the third period. Heading into the final period with a 5-2 lead, all USC needed to do was keep the Golden Bears at bay. Haralabidis chipped in another goal in the middle of the frame to give USC a 6-2 lead, and while Cal’s leading scorer Dora Antal would score one more time for the home team, the final score would hold in favor of USC, 6-3.
Overall, the Trojans were held to their lowest scoring output of the season after entering the game tops in the MPSF in scoring at 15.92 goals per game. However, Games’ two goals moved her up USC’s all-time scoring list, as she cracked the Top 20 to sit at No. 19 all-time with 120 career goals. Megens and Haralabidis also scored twice, while sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Longan turned out another double-digit save performance with 11 saves to round things out for the Trojans. With the conference victory, USC improves to 37-18 all-time against Cal with wins in the last 14 meetings.
Now, the Trojans (26-1) will be back in the pool next weekend as they close out the regular season with a game against crosstown rival No. 3 UCLA (19-1) in Westwood on Saturday at 1 p.m. With an MPSF title potentially on the line for USC, this matchup will be just the second between the two teams this season, as the Trojans beat the Bruins, 10-9, in Irvine back in late February. Furthermore, depending on the outcome, Saturday’s match could have major implications in terms of seeding for the NCAA Championship tournament in mid-May.

The Trojans can’t seem to catch a break. 
Just as the pieces seem to be falling into place, something gets derailed and the baseball team finds itself in the same situation. The series against Cal State Fullerton ended the same way as the series against Stanford a few weeks ago, with USC losing the series after claiming the first game.
Game 1 on Thursday at Dedeaux was filled with highlights. Every time the Titans scored, the Trojans answered with just as many or more runs. The lead continued to switch until the Trojans broke out in the bottom of the fifth inning, scoring six runs and winning 13-9.
The Titans got out to an early lead in the first inning, but the Trojans responded in the bottom of the third inning after freshman designated hitter Blake Sabol scored on junior third baseman Adalberto Carrillo’s triple. 
The Titans scored on a two-run double in the top of the fourth, but the Trojans answered with an RBI single by Rios,  and a sacrifice fly by senior outfielder Corey Dempster. Senior catcher Cris Perez and Sabol hit back-to-back doubles to put the Trojans ahead by one. 
“It’s been a work in progress,” Sabol said. “Having [head coach Dan] Hubbs give me some confidence going into this weekend was big.”
After freshman Chris Clarke allowed a three-run double in the top of the fifth, the Trojans scored six runs, as many as they did in the remaining two games.
The scoring spree started with redshirt senior left fielder David Edson and sophomore Brandon Perez’s back-to-back singles. Rios singled in another run after sophomore center fielder Lars Nootbaar’s sacrifice bunt and Dempster tied the game with another sacrifice fly.
“It’s definitely a big momentum swing, especially because their team was hitting the ball well, too,” Sabol said. “Whenever they scored, we found a way to score, too. We had a lot of fun out there.”
Cris Perez followed with an RBI single and Sabol brought a run home on an error by Cal State Fullerton shortstop Timmy Richards. Carrillo cleared the bases with a two-run double to cap the scoring for that inning. 
Clarke finished his night going five innings with a strikeout and six runs allowed, five earned. He was succeeded by junior pitcher Brad Wegman, who gave up three runs. 
Then came one of the highlights of the series in the final inning — Rios came up to bat against his brother, Josh, a reliever for the Titans. Frankie won the battle, doubling off of his younger brother and bringing in another insurance run for the Trojans. 
Dempster doubled Rios in to finish off the Trojans’ high scoring start to the series at 13 runs. He also ended the game with a diving catch in right field to secure the win. The 13 runs that the Trojans scored on 17 hits was the most that they had scored since their win over Wake Forest in February. 
Edson continued the Trojans’ call and response with the Titans, bringing home two runs on a single in the top of the third inning of Game 2 after two early Fullerton runs. The Titans had the upper hand in the fifth inning, scoring five runs off of sophomore starter CJ Stubbs.
The Trojans scored three runs in the top of the ninth on RBI doubles by Sabol, freshman outfielder Matthew Acosta and freshman outfielder Christian Moya; however, they could not overcome Fullerton’s 13 runs in a 13-5 loss.
In Game 3, sophomore pitcher Marrick Crouse went six innings, striking out two and giving up two runs. Fullerton’s starter John Gavin went seven innings, giving up one run. USC’s only run came on a solo home run by Cris Perez as the Trojans fell 2-1.
Though there were fewer moments for the highlight reel in the games at Fullerton, the Trojans had a good number of positive takeaways. Dempster hit safely in all three games, and Rios extended his hitting streak to eight games. Gates debuted and Crouse had the best Trojan start of the weekend. 
“I think our team is better than that showing,” Sabol said. “It can be scary for other teams because they might fall asleep seeing that record, but I think we’re a really strong team.”

Just a few weeks ago, thousands of protesters, many of them young people, took to the streets in Russia to speak out against rampant corruption. Met with stiff resistance, thousands were arrested as Russian dreams for a freer nation once again faded into a backdrop of repression and censorship. But across the seas, American millennials who, after the Women’s March and other demonstrations, have done their own fair amount of protesting, favor sexy over substantial political engagement, rendering us complacent in the face of political apathy and ignorance.
Our fascination with controversial speakers may spark great Facebook comment threads but ultimately misses the point.  Take for example the University of California, Berkeley, where two clubs invited unabashedly bigoted conservative commentator Ann Coulter to campus to speak on immigration.
In an age where the conflict around freedom of speech garners more attention than the conflicts dotting the Congo and Yemen, the obsessive, polarizing and media-driven debate around the First Amendment will likely yield more spotlights held and abused by provocateurs like far-right internet personality Milo Yiannopoulos. We delude ourselves by thinking controversy sparks understanding or awareness and in the process prioritize sensationalism over sensibility.
But before millennials can attend speaking engagements or even log out of Facebook, they first must dodge political memes left and right.  Marketed at best as political humor and at worst, as methods of political dialogue, memes, especially in light of the election, have risen to comfort — and incite — inform, delude, engage and disenchant. 
But for the most part, they cast serious issues in a light that ultimately favors flashy trends and viral news over real issues. Sharing a meme on social media may garner likes and laughs, but these pictures with text detract us from real, substantive politics and, even worse, can act as a form of substitution for real political engagement.
And now we turn to the elephant, or rather the protester, in the room. Americans of all ages and stripes took to the streets and social media to the Women’s March on January 21 to advocate for equality and women’s rights. And with the recent Trump Tax Return Rally and the upcoming March for Science, we can expect to see the same: a burst of millennial “political” energy and social media presence — followed by little else. 
Rallies make for good profile pictures, but in the long run, real political engagement requires much more.  Take the March for Science: Millennial participation remains crucial to elevate the cause of science, but once the posters gather dust in the closet and the temporal bursts of energy and activism subside, more needs to be done. 
Protests may gather attention in the short term, but to ensure a real shift in the political dialogue, we need to dedicate ourselves to calling members of Congress, adding our voice to the discussion regarding science and resolving to get involved in campaigns to elect politicians who share our values.
Regardless of this recent “millennial political involvement” taking hold, we must remain aware of the real issues.  Only half of the people in our generation cast ballots in the recent election, well below the national average. 
But we can become the generation that wields the greatest political clout in the nation. 
Next election cycle, millennials will form the greatest share of the electorate, but before we voice our opinions at the ballot box, we must first cultivate a greater sense of civic engagement in the other 11 months not named November.  And this civic engagement must be more focused and purposeful.  No longer can we be satisfied merely with controversy, memes and marches. This is our country — let’s act like it.

Last week, the White House revealed how the Trump administration will cut $18 billion from the federal budget while boosting defense spending by $30 billion — that is, by cutting a variety of educational programs, including taking $3.9 billion from the Pell grant program that helps low-income, high-achievers afford tuition. This decision, coupled with the recent discontinuation of a key tool in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, will make college less accessible for low-income students and decrease diversity on campus. USC’s faculty and administration should vocally oppose these actions.
The proposed Pell grant cuts are perhaps the administration’s most significant blow to educational equity. Pell grants are the nation’s largest income-based financial aid program. Because the aid does not have to be paid back, this money provides an immediate boost for low-income college students without the long-term drawbacks of othertypes of federal assistance. These grants also help to increase diversity on campuses — in 2011, 52.7 percent of Pell grant recipients were students of color. In the same year, these students made up just 31 percent of total enrollment in universities across the nation.
White House officials defend these cuts by pointing out that the cut would be covered by a budget overlay left over from the previous fiscal year. However, eliminating $3.9 billion means this money will not be used toward increasing college access for low-income students at a time when Pell grant funding is needed more than ever. Although maximum and average grant amounts have steadily increased since the mid-‘90s, the real value of the Pell grant has declined by two-thirds since 1979, while the cost of attending college has ballooned.
In addition, current levels of aid are inadequate, even for students at wealthy, highly competitive research universities like USC. According to ProPublica’s Debt by Degrees tool, USC provides a 76 percent discount on the total cost of college for low-income families — putting the University in the top one-fourth of colleges in the amount of aid it provides poor students. However, the University is not doing enough to bring students of this economic bloc to its campus in the first place, ranking near the middle of the pack in the ProPublica analysis. 
In 2014, the median federal debt among USC graduates who received Pell grants was $22,500, the 60th highest amount among the 115 top private research universities in the nation. These numbers show that USC has work to do when it comes to enrolling and supporting low-income students. 
The problem extends past USC, though. At Harvard, Yale and Princeton, Pell grant-eligible students made up less than 15 percent of total enrollment in 2014. In part, the low representation of low-income students reflects a lack of institutional commitment to expanding access, but it is also a result of the higher costs to recruit and support low-income students. The White House could support policies that incentivize outreach or institutional support for underrepresented students, but it appears ready to do the opposite.
Instead of rushing to solve this problem, the Trump administration recently abandoned the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, which simplifies the FAFSA by inputting detailed tax information at the touch of a button. Before the IRS tool was in place, fewer students finished the application due to its complexity. The change requires families to fill out the form manually, increasing the intricacy of the process and the likelihood that an application can be selected for verification — which can delay the distribution of aid. Ultimately, the loss of the tool will harm low-income students who rely on federal aid.
Low-income students depend on the federal government to support policies that recognize the importance, challenge and cost of educating students from all backgrounds. The White House’s proposal to cut Pell grant funding and FAFSA supports will bar underrepresented students from college. To affirm the University’s commitment to supporting these students and expanding diversity on campus, USC faculty and administration leaders should oppose the president’s attacks on college accessibility by allocating more funding to financial aid, scholarships and outreach to low-income communities to learn and better address their needs. As a leader among U.S. colleges, USC’s work toward expanding college accessibility could have the capacity to greatly influence other colleges to work toward this goal, too.
To be fair pell grant increases = tuition increases..
Or perhaps USC should reduce the cost of tuition accordingly.

I, like many other first-generation Vietnamese Americans, am a child born from the aftermath of war. We are the healing remnants of our parents’ and our grandparents’ broken identities and war-torn pasts. We grow up at the intersection of two vibrant cultures: the ubiquitous American culture in our schools and communities contrasted with the ethnic practices and traditions we cultivate within our homes.
It’s the middle of April — a significant month for the Vietnamese people. We call it Black April because the color black symbolizes the pain, suffering and defeat of Vietnamese refugees, as they fled their nation in Saigon’s historic fall to communism on April 30, 1975. I remember acknowledging the significance of this month while reading The Sympathizer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning book on the Vietnam War written by USC professor Viet Thanh Nguyen: “[April] was a month that meant everything to all the people in our small part of the world and nothing to most people in the rest of the world.” 
April and the Fall of Saigon are historic dates; however, they are only commemorated by those who hold roots from this “small part of the world,” even if millions of Vietnamese people are now scattered globally, with thousands living in cultural centers worldwide. The fact that such a momentous war, one that shook both Vietnam and America decades ago, was taught with brevity and lack of depth in school surprised me. 
My father’s lonesome refugee experience remained ingrained in my mind as I grew up. He was a proud survivor of a journey that killed many; he told stories of suffering, self-sacrifice and willful determination for a better life in an idealized nation of tall men and tall buildings. 
My mother, however, flew over to the United States with her
entire family under a sponsor. She doesn’t speak of the war often —  or about her past at all, in fact. This dichotomy strikes me every time I think of my parents’ past and of the war that displaced them.
Although I was well-versed about the war from my father’s experiences, the first time I learned about the Vietnam War in school was during my junior year in an AP U.S. History class. It was a small chapter within Lyndon B. Johnson’s presidency: a mere five pages in a thick 500-page book. Yet, that was enough for me to recognize that my present identity was a result of a history so detailed and complex, a history I did not necessarily agree with in regards to U.S. interventionist policy.
I realized my identity, alongside the identities of thousands of other Vietnamese Americans of my generation, holds the history of so much bloodshed, suffering, pain and destruction. It’s a difficult concept to grasp, especially in a commemorative month like April when the current events on the world stage draw parallels to what happened in Vietnam decades ago. 
My parents were refugees. Today, the stigma against refugees or immigrants seeking refuge in the United States remains, and I realize most of these stigmas are formed through the lack of education and representation of non-European immigrants in history books. I sympathize with the refugee experience and understand the depth of their stories because I am the result of this history. It’s hard to sympathize if one is oblivious to it all. 
I’m writing this column in commemoration of Black April — something I had never done before back home. When I used to live near Little Saigon in Orange County, I thought the observation ceremonies and marches were excessive, but now, as I study at a school where I constantly get asked if I’m Filipino or Pacific Islander, I want to do the month and its consequent events some justice. April is a sad month, a cruel one for the survivors of the war. But without it, I wouldn’t be here, as an American or even born at all.

On Friday night, Ground Zero Performance Café was bustling with students, gathered underneath the bright lights and conversing with milkshakes in hand. They were present to watch SPEAK USC: Asian and Black Voices, an event hosted by the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly and Undergraduate Student Government Program Board to share art and represent the voices of two diverse communities on campus.
The night kicked off with moderator Jason Chu, an L.A.-based rapper and poet who eminded the audience of the importance of events that strive to bring different communities together.
“Our fates are tied together tonight because tonight is a night of solidarity,” Chu said at the event. “Tonight is a night for showing up for each other, to celebrate the fact that there is more work to do, but there is work that is being done tonight.”
The first performer was Amaria Stern, a freshman majoring in dance and anthropology, who danced to a remixed version of Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit.” Swaying from side to side with stiff motions, Stern’s dance moves represented a prayer for the lives lost and affected by America’s dark history of lynching black people. The end of the dance, with Stern looking upwards at the trees, was a powerful reminder of the struggle that the African American community has suffered for generations. However, Stern reminded the audience that our past does not always define them, and her dance espoused a message of strength — that the black community can rise up and defy the prejudices it has endured.
“I think in a society where we are told that our limitlessness and our excellence is so rare, my prayer through this dance is that black people will begin to understand that their excellence is not rare,” Stern said. “We are meant to be excellent, and we are and we will continue to be.”
As the night continued, other students showcased their creativity. Isha Sakhalkar, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, sung about her journey to connect with her culture as the child of immigrants. Her experiences profoundly resonated with many who share the same background and struggles of not fluently speaking their family’s native language.
Constance Chan, a senior majoring in creative writing, delivered a speech about her adolescence, acknowledging the sacrifices her family made in
immigrating to the United States. Her speech was heartfelt yet solemn, as she described microaggressions she overcame in high school.
Empress Christian, a sophomore majoring in theatre, then performed a short play from Facing Our Truth: 10 Minute Plays on Trayvon, Race and Privilege, playing a black mother who must deal with the loss of her son. Christian, emphasized the necessity to change perceptions of African Americans — specifically, young black men.
“It can be so disheartening to look at this world and know that the people I care about in bodies that are non-white will never be safe,” Christian said in her talk. “Some days that is a harder thing to carry than others.”
Christian said that she tries to be a little bit kinder and more loving to people of color. Similarly, Leo Xia, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, challenged others to be kinder and less assuming when meeting him and other Asian students at USC.
His song, “Split Down the Middle,” highlighted the bicultural struggle to fulfill the expectations of two groups: He is not Asian enough, nor is he American enough. Xia delivered a hopeful message of unity;, saying he hoped both the Asian and black communities could overcome the preconceived biases and judgements they have about one another.
The final performance of the evening was by Lami Friebe, a freshman majoring in popular music, who closed out the night with some good tunes with his band The Syndicate. Inspired by The Beatles’ “Blackbird,” the band performed their harrowing song of the same name to express the struggles of the African American community. The song’s lyrics describe how a bird with clipped wings struggles to fly under the judgement of those who hurt it.
After the powerful song, Friebe and The Syndicate moved on to a lighter, comical song about Friebe’s beat-up ’89 Honda Civic. The night ended with an atmosphere of unity, as the crowd sang along to The Syndicate’s lyrics on cruising down highways during sunset.
