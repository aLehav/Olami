The Pac-12 has postponed USC’s matchup against UC Berkeley to Dec. 4, the universities respective athletic departments announced in a joint statement Tuesday. Initially scheduled for Saturday, it’s the first FBS game postponed this season because of coronavirus issues. Game time will be announced at a later date, according to the statement. 
Last weekend, positive coronavirus cases led to Cal playing without seven starters, five coaches and 24 scholarship athletes. Following the loss against Arizona, additional players tested for the virus and placed more players out of practice. 
“Due to additional impact on specific position groups, we have decided to postpone Saturday’s game. We have had multiple COVID-19 positives within our program, and we are taking every step we can to mitigate the spread and protect the greater community,” said Cal Director of Athletics Jim Knowlton in a statement. 
On Twitter, Cal players spoke against the university’s health services, and said they were forced to take coronavirus tests despite the university not requiring tests for the general student population. Golden Bears redshirt senior quarterback Chase Garbers took to Twitter to voice his frustration with the testing.
“We have worked too hard to have someone take this all away from us, it is wrong. We deserve answers and transparent communication,” Garbers wrote. 
USC’s next matchup will be against UCLA at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Nov. 20.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault and violence.
President Carol Folt addressed the information delay in the recent sexual assault and drugging reports, the Varsity Blues scandal, the consulting firm McKinsey & Company’s role in USC’s Culture Journey and the George Tyndall sexual abuse case in a campuswide email Monday that included a link to Frequently Asked Questions. 
The letter comes five days after professor of law and history Ariela Gross published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times titled “As a USC professor, I can’t stay quiet about the administration’s toxic culture” that criticized the University’s administration and its handling of multiple scandals throughout the past few years through the recent sexual assault reports at Sigma Nu Fraternity.
The FAQs addressed many of the concerns Gross raised in her op-ed, including the delay in information reported about the Sept. 30 sexual assault and drugging reports at the Sigma Nu Fraternity house. Since information received by Relationship & Sexual Violence Prevention Services is confidential, the Department of Public Safety was “uncertain” how to address the information, according to the FAQs.
The University scheduled a meeting to determine next steps on Oct. 18., and on Oct. 16, a student reported being sexually assaulted by a member of the same fraternity. 
The questions addressed the administration’s information sharing policies regarding ongoing developments in the Varsity Blues scandal. Most recently, former USC Athletic Director Official Donna Heinel pleaded guilty to her role in helping students’s admission to the University by inaccurately portraying them as athletes. 
The University said they took “detailed steps” to “safeguard the integrity of the athletic admissions process,” including reviewing student-athlete’s files on three levels and USC head coach certification that students are being recruited for their athletic abilities and roster audits. 
In 2019, the University sent out FAQs regarding the Varsity Blues scandal, including that they were cooperating with investigations, held those involved accountable and implemented the changes mentioned in Monday’s FAQs.
The questions also addressed the former Dean of the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work Marilyn Louise Flynn’s recent indictment — which Gross mentioned in her op-ed — that alleges she was involved in a bribery scheme with Los Angeles city councilmember Mark Ridley-Thomas, writing that the University has cooperated with the investigation since learning of it in 2018. 
In her op-ed, Gross criticized the McKinsey consulting firm’s alleged involvement in shaping USC’s Culture Journey, noting McKinsey’s contribution to the opioid crisis and immigrant detention facilities which was denied by USC in their FAQs. 
Regarding concerns about USC’s handling of the George Tyndall sexual abuse case, the University said it is cooperating with its obligations regarding the class action settlement.
The University also said it is complying with the “resolution agreement with the Office for Civil Rights, including providing ongoing information to OCR as required by the resolution agreement.”
The University has expanded RSVP services, hired more female physicians and “[implemented] a university-wide Clery Act Policy and Interdisciplinary Review Team,” according to the questions.
However, the FAQs did not directly address Gross’ statement that USC has not released reports about Tyndall or former medical school dean Dr. Carmen Puliafito.
During a “Save our Students” protest last Friday, faculty chanted “Let’s see the reports,” referencing Tyndall’s and Puliafito’s, outside of Bovard, and multiple professors expressed long term concerns about USC’s handling of sexual abuse.
The questions also addressed Provost Charles Zukoski’s email last week in which he wrote that there are many organizations on campus that use Greek letters and that it is “critical not to make assumptions or target any particular groups or individuals simply because they live in the same area or residence where events may have occurred.”
The University wrote on the website that many students living near the Row reported harassment, targeting and “being treated insensitively by some faculty members” following the sexual assault reports. 
The answer referred students to additional statements in Zukoski’s letter that sexual assault is “abhorrent” and a systemic problem within society. 
In the communitywide email, Folt cited the University’s Zoom town hall Wednesday as further evidence of the administration’s transparency, where USC officials such as Folt, Zukoski, DPS Chief Thomas and Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman discussed the University’s response to the sexual assault reports. 
However, students and the Undergraduate Student Government criticized the administration last week for canceling the planned in-person town hall with various student organizations on the day that it was supposed to take place, instead opting for the Zoom format.

Students are raising concerns about Viterbi professor James Moore’s decision to hang a “blue lives matter” flag outside of his office door, citing the flag’s racist origins and Moore’s past remarks regarding Title IX and USC’s diversity initiatives. 
Shai Porat, a graduate student studying neuroscience, brought his concerns to the Dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering and USC’s Office of Equity and Diversity in mid-October when he first saw the flag. 
“This is an inappropriate and unnecessary symbol to have on an office door where USC is, within the last year or two, trying to have a much broader diversity initiative and to be inclusive, especially in the STEM area,” Porat said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Both offices informed Porat that there is no policy in place that would support the flag’s removal. 
“The university does not have a policy that limits the display of materials in spaces like this, though we are looking at whether it is needed,” the University said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “As part of the university’s commitment to academic freedom, a faculty member can express his or her individual beliefs and viewpoints on a wide variety of topics – even controversial issues – but they do not speak on behalf of a school or the broader university.”
Porat said the display is a “trolling situation” because of Moore’s history of controversy. In 2018, Moore responded to a schoolwide email about Title IX saying that “accusers sometimes lie.” The response incited protests, where students called for his termination. In an article he published on the National Association of Scholars’ website, Moore described diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at USC as “counterproductive” and said he was “skeptical” that USC has any processes that bolster racism and inequality. 
“[Moore] had to know this would be an inappropriate thing to have, especially with USC’s diversity initiatives,” Porat said. 
Maricarmen Pachicano, a graduate student studying neuroscience, found out about the flag through her friend who works in the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology building, where Moore’s office is located. She said she does not think that USC is taking this issue seriously. 
“I want them to take it down, and I want them to do something about Professor Moore because this is not the first controversial thing he’s done,” Pachicano said. 
Moore said he decided to hang the flag in early August to “communicate a different view than what students are used to seeing.” 
“I wanted to remind students that there are multiple points of view present on this campus, because we are becoming fairly homogenous in respect to ideas,” Moore said. 
The flag gained popularity following the homicides of law enforcement officers in 2014. Since then, people have increasingly flown it at Black Lives Matter counter protests and white supremicist rallies, including the Capitol riot on Jan. 6. 
Moore believes that the “blue lives matter” and Black Lives Matter movements are not mutually exclusive and said that “blue lives protect Black lives.”
“We have a tendency to argue that Black lives are in danger from the police,” Moore said. “Nothing could be further from the truth.”
According to the Mapping Police Violence database, 26% of people killed by police in 2021 were Black. Porat and Pachicano said it is crucial that students are aware of the flag, especially when considering Moore’s past contentious actions. 
“It’s the entire context of how this flag is being portrayed and who exactly is portraying it … is just inappropriate and that should factor into the University’s decision,” Porat said. “It is important for students to know who their professors are.”

Most students can’t say that they’ve been a part of a film with three Academy Award nominations, a Screen Actors Guild Award for best cast in a motion picture, two weeks on top of the box office and over $80 million in gross ticket sales — but De’Onna “Tree” Young-Stephens can. 
A 2021 School of Cinematic Arts Master of Fine Arts graduate from Winston-Salem, N.C.. Young-Stephens’s love for the arts started from a young age at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, where she studied ballet. 
“The school that I was actually dancing at had filmmakers,” Young-Stephens said. “I really never knew that making movies was a real thing. I saw movies, and I was like, ‘Where do they come from?’ Had I never danced, I probably don’t know if I would be doing this, because people aren’t exposed to filmmaking where I’m from.”
Although she ended up pursuing a bachelor’s degree in public relations from North Carolina A&T, Young-Stephens would, with professor’s permission, often miss classes to make a 4.5 hour drive down to Atlanta, Ga., where she worked jobs as a production assistant, actress and an assistant director. 
On the last day of a shoot where she was working in the art department as a set dresser, a man named Wynn Thomas came up to her as she was packing up and randomly offered his business card. After a quick Google search, Young-Stephens discovered that Thomas was the first African American production designer in film history, known for Academy Award winners such as “A Beautiful Mind” and collaborations with Robert DeNiro and Spike Lee, to name a few. Young-Stephens immediately called him back and scheduled an appointment. 
Initially, Thomas wanted to bring Young-Stephens onto an independent film he was working on as a set decorator. She reluctantly agreed but, in the spur of the moment, explained that she actually didn’t have an eye for draping blankets over chairs or propping pillows to make the environment come to life — instead, she wanted to be behind the camera. Thomas got up and walked out of the room. 
Afterward, Thomas came back in with a producer who offered her a job as an assistant to Hollywood heavyweights Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe on the set of “Hidden Figures.”
This turned out to be an invaluable opportunity, as she was able to network and learn from all the roles on set, from the camera crew to the cinematographers, all the way to director Theodore Melfie, who eventually wrote one of Young-Stephens’s recommendation letters for admission into the MFA program at USC.
Despite receiving offers from other prestigious institutions such as American Film Institute and New York University, Young-Stephens hopped on a plane to LAX and subsequently started at SCA.
“She wants what she wants, and she’ll get what she wants to get. She does not settle for anything. She has very high standards of excellence,” said August K. Burton, a fellow MFA graduate.
Burton and Young-Stephens were collaborating on a short film for a class early in their MFA journeys, and Burton said that he remembers shooting lazy shots and being resigned to failure as the sun was going down. 
“I remember De’Onna, she pulled me to the side and said, ‘August, stop filming right now. Stop doing this. You’re not doing this. You’re going to have to shoot this again later on because I’m not letting you do this mediocre stuff.’ And I really admired her because she wouldn’t let me settle and not live up to my own potential,” Burton said.
While preparing for her senior thesis, Young-Stephens was in a documentary class trying to pitch ideas, but nothing seemed powerful enough.
Young-Stephens stumbled across a peer’s Facebook video, which explained the pronunciation and significance of her Pakistani name. In the clip, Young-Stephens’s peer details her decision to stop shortening her name just to make it easier for people to say.
Young-Stephens, who had been going by “Dee” or “Tree” at school, resonated with this and the video brought up past memories of having the apostrophe taken out of her name or testing documentation rejecting her name because of it. 
Initially, the documentary was going to highlight stories from around the world, including Pakistan, America and China, but Young-Stephens soon realized she needed to revisit her plan.
“The idea was so complex, and I didn’t want it to look like tokenism. I realized that if I wanted to talk about this, I needed to have a separate documentary for each one of these groups. I can’t have one person speaking on behalf of everyone. So then, my professors suggested making it about Black names. ‘Talk about your story and your struggle and then talk to other people with these Black names as well,’” Young-Stephens said.  
Young-Stephens’s idea for the documentary was also well-received by her peers, especially because many could relate to the story.  
“I remember she pitched her project in front of a panel of guest judges, and it just elicited such a response from everybody from so many different backgrounds and genders. Their responses ranged from ‘Oh my God, I have this funny anecdote and I used to get picked on’ to ‘I have very severe trauma and have wanted to change my name my whole life.’ And so there was a whole spectrum of human emotions that this whole topic touched on,” said producer and fellow classmate Madeline Gamero.
Young-Stephens spoke to people who have culturally Black names as well as Anglo-Black names, alongside other professionals and researchers for better insight. From there, the documentary started to transform. 
Shooting during the coronavirus pandemic presented challenges because Young-Stephens had to direct everything over Zoom. With the cinematographer and other crew members, she had to explain how to adjust the camera and mic virtually in order to get usable content.
Eventually, “Not Just A Name” was created, a piece that explores the stigma and racial bias experienced by African Americans with unique-sounding names as well as the name’s historical origins.
Produced by Gamero and associate producer Victoria Perez, edited by Sammie Moynihan and Chance Davis, and with director of photography Madison Kloeber, this project was a labor of love, according to Young-Stephens. “Not Just A Name” also turned into a learning opportunity for the crew members.
“I think it’s really important to tell because it’s a very specific story, but one of the things we talked about from the beginning was the universality of it,” said Sammie Moynihan, one of the editors for “Not Just A Name.” “Names are so important to everyone, and it’s incredibly unfair that some names are treated worse than other names. I have a very common white name and so some of it was just thinking about things that I hadn’t considered before.” 
Winning a Student Academy Award had been on Young-Stephens’s radar for a while. Every day Young-Stephens would break off into a directing class taught by Professor Mark Harris and forgo pleasantries to tell Harris that she wanted to win a Student Academy Award. But by the end of shooting a film through the pandemic, Young-Stephens felt defeated and didn’t even want to submit to the competition.
After much hesitation, she applied, and to her surprise, “Not Just A Name” won a bronze medal in the documentary category. 
“I really had no clue or no way of anticipating this [win], and so I think that makes it even more special because no one came in with the expectation that once the project was done we were actually going to get that bar, so it’s kind of crazy,” Gamero said. 
With the hopes of modeling her career after Ava DuVernay, Young-Stephens wants to produce, write and direct, not just documentary pieces but narrative as well. 
“I hope that I’m able to shift the industry a little bit because I know that sometimes people can get put into certain categories,”  Young-Stephens said. “Being a woman of color, things are a bit challenging. I hope to pave the way for other women of color and people of color in general.”

“Eddie on Aux” is a biweekly series on a few songs that intrigue me. They don’t have to be earth-shattering or terrible, just something interesting enough to warrant an article. It is not a recommendation of what to play in the car to impress your friends, despite what the title suggests. 
“Unloyal” (with Ari Lennox) — Summer Walker
On her latest project, “Still Over It,” Summer Walker is as confident as ever in her brand. She remains the pinnacle of melodrama and messiness and writes her songs with such brutal honesty that those traits somehow become aspirational.
In the same way that Drake is treated like a folk hero by some of the male population, Walker’s music gives the female audience an imperfect role model to follow — flaws and all. Her songs are sermons composed of Instagram caption-worthy one-liners and perfect fodder for those whose lives aren’t nearly eventful enough to live vicariously through Walker’s gospel.
“Still Over It” centers around Walker’s romantic split with longtime collaborator London on da Track, who produced 14 tracks on her previous album, “Over It.” Ironically, the breakup put Walker’s music in the hands of other beatmakers, and her sound diversified as a result.
On “Unloyal,” she operates at a slower BPM on a soulful, loungey cut. “I guess I’m unloyal, baby / We’ll call it what you want,” she sings, unbothered, backhandedly insulting a man for being childish and unreasonable. Over a smooth saxophone and drums that pace the song at a saunter, the line feels all the more scathing.
“Ballad 0” (Recorded At Electric Lady Studios) — Japanese Breakfast
All Michelle Zauner has done in the last year is release an album and EP, write the soundtrack for a video game and publish “Crying In H Mart,” a New York Times bestselling memoir, which is set to be adapted into a movie. Now, she adds a live album, recorded at the iconic Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, to her already incredible body of work. Zauner is the most unconventional of stars — born in Seoul, with a degree in creative writing from a small liberal arts college — nothing could have foreshadowed her prominence. But she’s arrived nonetheless, writing books and songs that display her polymathic range.
Zauner’s live album is recorded under Japanese Breakfast, the band she fronts and the name most associated with her music. The songs are mostly acoustic renditions of her older work, with sparse live instrumentation behind Zauner’s voice. Without the sonic distortion or excess, her vocals take center stage and fill the room. “Ballad 0” repurposes a song she originally recorded in the early days of the pandemic, when she was confined to her apartment. What was a bedroomy, lo-fi tune is transformed into a heartfelt folk ballad. 
“Things You Could Die For If Doing While Black” — Mick Jenkins
Mick Jenkins seems to appreciate good poetry. On his 2018 album “Pieces of a Man,” he emulates the brilliant, revolutionary spoken word poet Gil Scott-Heron’s work of the same name, as he ponders great questions of the mind.
Like fellow Chicago-native and musical predecessor Common, Jenkins raps over jazzy beats with a narrator-worthy voice but sometimes digs himself in a hole trying to be too intellectual, or too creative with metaphors and wordplay. But at his best, he operates like a poet, lyricizing with intention.
“Things You Could Die For If Doing While Black” leaves little to the imagination, as far as song titles go. Jenkins, though always profound, doesn’t usually tackle politically relevant issues as overtly as he does on “Things.” On the track, he follows a structure often employed in other forms of activism: the first-person narrative that centers himself in actions that have led to Black lives being lost.
“Might wanna go for a jog” and “Might wanna sleep in my bed” invokes the tragic murders of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, respectively. Before Jenkins’ tackles larger issues, first, he wants a chance to live in peace.
“Small Crimes” — Nilüfer Yanya
I first came across Nilüfer Yanya while watching the HBO series “Industry.” At first glance, the show about a handful of yuppy Oxbridge grads navigating the buzzsaw world of investment banking wasn’t something I thought would be terribly enlightening. But like Yanya’s music, which is featured in the show’s outstanding soundtrack, the show captures the seesaw of existential anxiety and raging ambition in today’s 20-somethings.
When Yanya released “Small Crimes” in the infancy of her career, her songwriting talent was evident. She’s since made genre-bending music with roots in bubbly indie rock, but it’s her pen that has been the mark of her songs. “Small Crimes” plays similarly to “nostalgia, ULTRA”- era Frank Ocean; she writes complicated emotions into strings of clarity.

In between the mile-long Dulce line and busy Target shoppers, the USC Village was transformed into a celebration of Mexican culture, including an ofrenda, papel picado and the star of the show: Grupo Folklórico del USC. 
Saturday’s event marked the third annual showcase from Grupo Folklórico but only the second in-person performance celebrating Día de los Muertos. 
After last year’s performance was held over Zoom, the audience’s excitement was tangible as they clapped and chanted throughout the event. The Latinx community gathered to cheer on the performers, honor the holiday and appreciate traditional Mexican folk dancing.
Keeping with the group’s mission to “educate the USC community about Mexican culture by performing traditional dances alongside folkloric music,” the dancers wore colorful long skirts and the ruffled tops of Sinaloa. For Día de los Muertos or Day of the Day, the group painted their faces in the calavera style — an homage to the idea that all are equal in death. 
The group performed dances from all over Mexico, including Sinaloa, Veracruz, Chihuahua, Baja and Durango. The dances honored important groups throughout Mexican history including the Soldaderas, women soldiers in Mexico during the revolution who have since become feminist icons, and vaqueros, the first cowboys, who were mostly Indigenous Mexican men.   
In between dances, Ivonne Rodriguez, the emcee, spoke about the importance of Día de los Muertos, emphasizing it as a day of love and family. In Mexican culture, Día de los Muertos is one of the most important holidays of the year. The holiday, which takes place Nov. 1 and 2, is about families reconnecting and celebrating the lives of their lost loved ones. For Keila Rodriguez, a member of Grupo Folklórico, dancing is the way she celebrates the holiday. 
“Día de los Muertos means we’re representing our ancestors,” Rodriguez said. “We’re showing it through our dances of different regions throughout Mexico. We’re giving thanks that they came here, helped us and gave us a path to follow.”
Another way people celebrate Día de los Muertos is by honoring their ancestors through the ofrenda — an altar typically in a family’s home that honors deceased family members by putting their pictures alongside flowers, decorations and food. To continue this tradition, next to their stage, Grupo Folklórico made their own ofrenda full of pictures of loved ones and covered with marigolds, a traditional flower for the ofrenda which is often referred to as the flor de muerto, or flower of the dead. 
To Diana Cuevas, a dancer with Grupo Folklórico and a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration, being a member of Grupo Folklórico is not only about celebrating and giving thanks, but also about sharing her culture. 
“I am from Mexican descent, so [my family and I] already celebrate Día de los Muertos,” Cuevas said. “So to be able to bring [Día de los Muertos] into the whole USC community, it’s really nice to be able to share that.”
For other members of Grupo Folklórico, the show is more than dancing; it is a way to connect people of a shared background. LeeAnna Villarrea, a junior majoring in journalism, joined the group after seeing its booth at the involvement fair in 2019 and quickly found a sense of community with Grupo Folklórico.
“Going to a PWI as a person of color can feel pretty lonely” Villarreal said.  “To meet with people that have the same background as me two times a week, it’s so comforting.”

There’s no debate that baseball’s reign as “America’s Pastime” has come to an end. With the NFL’s tight grasp on viewership in the United States, MLB has fallen out of the spotlight. Of course, there are still millions of avid baseball fans, but football attracts viewers like no other sport. ESPN’s Monday Night Football brought in over 14 million viewers in Week 8 Nov. 1.
It brought in another 1.96 million on ESPN2, where former quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning break down the game and host a consistently fantastic group of guests on the “ManningCast.” 14 million viewers in a Week 8 matchup between the New York Giants and the Kansas City Chiefs is impressive, but that number will only grow as the season continues. Over 96 million people watched last season’s Super Bowl, compared to baseball, which averaged 11.75 million viewers for the World Series between the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves. These numbers are staggering.
Maybe it’s unfair to compare a matchup between two teams from average-sized markets with a Super Bowl featuring the NFL’s two biggest stars in quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady, but these trends extend beyond just last season. Year after year, the Super Bowl is the most-watched television event in the U.S. Out of the 30 TV broadcasts with the highest viewership, all but two are Super Bowls. The most-watched World Series, featuring the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers, only attracted 44 million viewers. 
Baseball will likely never take back its throne, but maybe it can be salvaged. According to a 2017 data poll, the average age of a MLB fan is 57. This is up from 2005, when the average age was 52. There are fewer young baseball fans today than ever before; the sport isn’t growing. The average ages of NBA, NHL and NFL fans are 42, 49 and 51, respectively. There is a clear distinction between the age groups of each fanbase.
As with all other forms of entertainment, MLB executives will have to figure out a way to attract a younger audience. This could be a challenge in a world that simply has so many different stimuli for young adults. Why would I want to watch a low-scoring World Series game when I can stream hundreds of Netflix shows or get lost in my TikTok feed?
Perhaps the biggest obstacle in baseball’s way is the slow pace of play. MLB tried to address this issue by implementing a pitch clock, shortening double header games to 7 innings and placing a runner on second base in games that went to extra innings. However, if we are sticking to the numbers, these rule changes didn’t work. In 2021, baseball games still lasted three hours and 10 minutes on average. MLB already rescinded the extra innings rule change and will return to its traditional format this upcoming season.
The continual issues with pace of play have separated the sport from young people. A lot of my friends have described baseball as boring. Even in middle school, I remember hearing jokes about how it’s not a “real sport” and is nothing compared to playing football or basketball. To be quite honest, while I have always believed baseball to be one of the hardest and most skill-based sports, for much of my life, I didn’t pay much attention to MLB. I enjoyed going to a baseball game every now and then and watched the World Series, but baseball’s intricacies were lost on me. It wasn’t until a little over a year ago that I began to appreciate baseball.  
The coronavirus pandemic was a terrible time for so many people around the world, and the temporary loss of professional sports was nothing compared to the tragedies that occurred because of the virus. However, I sure did miss watching sports during the first several months of the pandemic. During a time when it was difficult to find an effective distraction, I knew that if I could have been watching March Madness or the NBA, it would have been just a bit more enjoyable.
MLB was the first of the four major professional sports in the U.S. to return after the pandemic began, commencing its shortened season on July 23. The MLB had the rare opportunity to be the only major American sport on television. And so, I decided that I would give baseball a real try for the first time.
I gained an appreciation for the sport’s subtleties watching regular season games. The analytics, the mental battle between the batter and pitcher and the late game rallies all won me over. After returning to L.A. in Fall 2020, I was able to get downtown after the Dodgers won the World Series. Seeing people celebrate something for the first time in what felt like far too long was special. 
MLB needs to fight to expand its audience. MLB could attract a younger fanbase by putting more personable former players such as Alex Rodriguez or Doug Glanville in the booth and making its games more accessible instead of hiding the games behind paywalls or cable subscriptions. While football is king for the foreseeable future, professional baseball is too great to fade away.

USC had five players in action this past weekend in what was the last fall competition for USC. Juniors Stefan Dostanic and Samuel Rubell competed in the ITA National Fall Championships, and freshman Peter Makk, graduate student Paul Barretto and junior Ryder Jackson contended in the Jack Kramer Classic.
No. 64 Dostanic started singles play this past Thursday in the round of 32 with a win over Kentucky graduate student Francois Musitelli 6-1, 6-4. Dostanic also picked up an upset win in the round of 16, knocking off Georgia Tech’s No. 31 Andres Martin 7-6 (5), 6-2 to advance to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, he matched up with  Oklahoma State’s No. 20 Matej Vocel and lost in a hard fought match 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-1.
Dostanic was one of USC’s most consistent singles players in the fall season with a 21-3 record in overall singles matches and a 19-3 record in doubles matches.
“The big thing for him is his presence on the court when he’s out at practice and not giving anything other than 100% while pushing the guys across from him to work as hard as he does,” Head Coach Brett Masi said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Overall, he has done a great job with his maturity on the court in terms of his everyday attitude and processing how he can improve his game.”
In doubles, Dostanic and Rubell started things off with a victory in the round of 32 against Montana State sophomores Panik Matej and Daan Van Dijk 6-3, 6-2, but the duo came up short in the round of 16 to Charlotte’s redshirt freshman Coy Simon and sophomore Stefanos Savva 6-4, 6-4. Although Dostanic and Rubell’s tournament ended in the round of 16, the duo was still one of the most dominant for USC this fall as they entered the competition with an undefeated 5-0 record and finished with an overall record of 6-1.
“[Dostanic and Rubell] get along well, and with doubles, it’s all about chemistry and in some instances some guys don’t get along very well but they just play well together,” Masi said. “Their personalities and their character match hand in hand while also being good friends off the court.”
Dostanic finished the fall season with a 21-2 record in overall doubles matches and a 20-2 record in doubles dual matches. Rubell concluded his fall season and his first with the Trojans after transferring from Duke.
At the Jack Kramer Classic, USC was unable to pick up any victories. In the round of 32, Makk lost to redshirt sophomore Marvin Schaber of USD 6-3, 6-0, Barretto fell to SDSU sophomore Johannes Seeman 6-2, 6-3, and Jackson’s match against redshirt sophomore Joe Leather of Cal Poly ended in a walkover due to an injury Jackson sustained.
Injuries held USC back from making deeper runs in the tournament. 
“We tried to get them to go out and play, but our guys weren’t 100%,” Masi said. “I applaud their efforts to go out there and try to play, but they just couldn’t go.”
Makk finished his fall season with a singles record of 5-4; Barretto ended up with a 4-8 singles record and Jackson finished with a solid 7-3 record in singles. Makk and Barretto are just a few of some of the new additions to a deep team that will look to build on their fall success this spring.
“[Makk, Barretto and Rubell] have all been excellent for us this fall for sure and all these guys are going to play an integral part for us in the spring,” Masi said.
USC looks to use its fall competitions as opportunities to build chemistry and prepare for play in the spring.
“Five out of the seven tournaments we played in we either finaled or won the tournament in some capacity whether it was doubles or singles, which shows we had a pretty successful fall season,” Masi said. “The way that guys are playing and not falling into old habits while playing at the capacity they’re capable of are all positives.”
USC will have some time to rest and prepare for the start of the spring season Jan. 15, where the team will compete in the Sherwood Cup in Thousand Oaks, Calif.

When the final buzzer rang in Indianapolis last March, it signaled the end of a historic run for the Trojans. They advanced to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2001, eventually falling to a Gonzaga team that competed in the NCAA tournament final. 
Despite last season’s accomplishments, the 2021-2022 campaign begins with a lot of uncertainty. USC is retaining six of its top eight scorers, but the two leading scorers, center Evan Mobley and guard Tahj Eaddy, are not returning. 
Here are some of the top players to look out for as the Trojans start up their season. 
Junior forward Isaiah Mobley 
The Trojans retained many talented players, including junior forward Isaiah Mobley, who decided to take his name out of the running for the NBA Draft and play another season at USC in July. The curtain has not yet fallen on the Mobley era at USC, despite losing Evan Mobley to the Cleveland Cavaliers as a result of the 2021 NBA draft. 
As a stretch-big power forward, Mobley averaged 9.9 points and 7.3 rebounds per game last season as a consistent starter for the team. His passing chemistry with his brother provided some easy buckets in the paint, but Mobley will be tasked with shot-creating more often this season without his partner. 
As a team captain this season, Mobley will look to establish himself as a leader both on and off the court. 
Junior guard Ethan Anderson
Ethan Anderson put together some memorable performances last season, most notably in USC’s blowout 66-48 win over UCLA Feb. 6, where he scored a career-high 19 points with 5 3-pointers. 
Injuries abbreviated his season, and Anderson started just 6 games in total. His minutes are set to increase with the loss of Eaddy, who took most of the minutes at point guard last season. 
With this increase in playtime, Anderson’s playmaking abilities will be important for the overall flow of the offense. He averaged 2.7 assists per game last season, tied for second on the team. 
Senior guard Drew Peterson 
A transfer from Rice, Drew Peterson carved out a spot for himself in Head Coach Andy Enfield’s rotation last season. Peterson fulfilled his role as a spot-up shooter, and he will be the team’s best returning three-point shooter with a 38.5% average last season.
Peterson won’t just stick to shooting, though. Standing at 6’9”, he has the height to match up with forwards on defense and pull in rebounds. He averaged 5 rebounds per game last season, good for third on the team. His agility and playmaking ability get him minutes as a guard as well, and he was tied for second on the team in assists per game last season with 2.7. 
Newcomers
A mostly veteran team will be aided by new additions such as Memphis transfer junior guard Boogie Ellis and four-star freshman guard Malik Thomas. 
Ellis earned AAC Co-Sixth Man of the Year status with Memphis last season. Coming off the bench, he averaged 10.2 points per game in 28 games played last season. Ellis will also add three-point shooting to the roster, as he shot 38.6% from three last season.
Thomas, a California native, averaged 22.6 points per game as a senior in high school and was named 2020-21 California High School Boys Gatorade Player of the Year. Thomas will be a physical option at guard and is set to be a defensive asset for USC.

On Oct. 28, the internet’s favorite humanoid-reptile proclaimed his vision for the future: “The metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet.” 
According to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s name-change to Meta more accurately captures the company’s trajectory as not only a social network for suburban moms but also a multimedia venture for cloud computing, personal entrepreneurship and virtual reality. Facebook’s rebranding is now in the spotlight of the tech community and emblemizes Silicon Valley’s shifting ethos.
In this announcement, Zuckerberg embeds his desire to change the public’s perception of both Facebook and his personal brand. By developing Horizon, Facebook’s virtual reality suite, Facebook could appeal toward the younger, technologically-savvy generation and override its reputation as a platform for older audiences. 
However, the shift’s more meaningful impact concerns Zuckerberg himself. Scandals embroil Facebook’s history, from burying data and misleading the public to inciting violent political polarization. According to Kevin Roose from the New York Times, Meta gives Zuckerberg a new chance to “be remembered as a visionary technologist rather than a destroyer of democracy.” 
Meta’s mission itself is polarizing. It suggests not only a virtual reality but also a mixed reality: a marriage between the physical and virtual worlds. 
This concept is inherently dangerous, as Professor David Reid from Liverpool Hope University explains, “Whoever controls it, will basically have control over your entire reality.” 
This degree of control over our personal lives is frightening. To those who doubt this mission’s impact, look no further than to our own lives for empirical proof: Our phones have undoubtedly become an extension of our own selves, which comes with all the good and bad attached — feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, unfair social comparison and mindless consumption.
Yes, I may sound like a boomer and not a college student writing this, but I want to convey the pervasiveness of Meta’s driving philosophy if Zuckerberg were to succeed in executing it.
On one hand, Meta establishes a universal interconnectivity that would essentially preserve our most important resource — time. Meta’s hypothetical normalization of a virtual workplace cannot be understated, as several coronavirus-era studies show that knowledge workers actually became more productive working from home. Who wouldn’t want to spend more time at home with their families? 
Meta would also have powerful implications for digital healthcare. In an article for Forbes, Dr. Sai Balasubramanian claimed,“It may become a generation-defining revolution in medicine.” 
For creatives, a virtual metaverse would be almost like a dream. Artists and designers could build their own world and personal avatar, which would open up new opportunities. 
However, we cannot ignore Meta’s potential, existential danger. Aside from opening the gates to new forms of cyber criminality, data breaches and corporate abuses of power, Meta’s goal — if executed to completion — will fundamentally change the way we live and what we live for. By existential, I don’t mean “threatening our existence” but “internally changing it.” Meta’s philosophy literally creates an entirely virtual universe for us to live in. 
This threat finally brings us to my main position — why? I believe it is crucial to ask ourselves: Why do we feel the need to digitize everything we can accomplish outside the virtual realm? We must challenge ourselves to look beyond the simple, rational pros and cons of digitization. Will a digital metaverse actually bring us joy as a society?
As a passionate student of science, I struggled with this question. While I admire technology’s use to augment our current functions, I cannot envision a new universe where it completely replaces these functions. As the pandemic demonstrated, interconnectivity cannot be replaced, and as a result of its deprivation, many felt lonely and lost. 
For this reason, Meta’s vision frightens me: In this paradigm, we trade technological progress and efficiency for our humanity. As stated earlier, this pattern is not just exclusive to Meta, but it also represents a growing shift in Silicon Valley’s ethos. We tend to digitize life for the sake of science — and in many cases, money — without considering its ethics and our happiness. 
Billionaires would like to be remembered as futurists. However, they fail to consider their version of futurism as something their grandchildren dread.

In our Instagram-saturated world, comparison culture has become Generation Z’s bedrock, ultimately causing a disproportionate rise in body dysmorphia, eating disorders and self-consciousness. These problems surrounding body image are only compounded in college, where students’ weights generally fluctuate because of different eating habits and sporadic workout schedules. 
Given the ubiquity of body image issues, USC must be more sensitive to eating disorder culture. To effectively cultivate an environment conducive to body confidence, USC must first reevaluate its signs posted around campus. 
For example, the signs posted in the Parkside Dining Hall that say, “Think twice before taking another slice,” can wreak irreparable ramifications. When students repeatedly read signs instructing them to assess what they eat before eating more, they will inevitably internalize the message that they should eat less and become more likely to develop abnormal eating habits. 
According to the National Eating Disorders Association, promoting diet culture can induce disordered eating patterns as “35% of ‘normal’ dieters progress to pathological dieting” and 20-25% of those diets “progress to partial or full-syndrome eating disorders.” This is why USC must replace its diet-centric signs with more body-positive messages. 
For example, my friend begged me to go to the dining hall with him last week simply because he was starving and wanted two grilled cheese sandwiches. Despite the fact that I had already eaten, he believed the staff would scorn him for taking more than one, so he wanted me to grab the extra one for him. 
Although they advertise USC’s waste diversion program, these signs foster a culture of feeling bad for wanting more food. This shaming can create a cycle that eventually metastasizes into an eating disorder. 
Ultimately, these signs do more harm toward students than good for the environment by inadvertently perpetuating eating disorder culture. This problem is a one-step fix. To create a more favorable environment for students, especially those who are vulnerable to or struggling with an eating disorder, USC must create different signs for the dining halls. 
Such signs, laden with eating disorder messages, also exist in USC Village. For example, Face Haus had a sign outside its store that read, “A spa-grade facial for the cost of two weeks of lattes,” with the sub print, “No calories. No brainer.” 
While Face Haus intended to advertise its perceivably affordable and first-rate facials, it simultaneously perpetuates an unhealthy mindset by encouraging potential customers to purchase their services instead of spending money on coffee. Its sales pitch ultimately rests on the idea that skipping your regular latte allows you to cut down on calories, which, as they posit, should be a “no brainer.” 
The sign ultimately romanticizes the idea of cutting calories — something essential to unhealthy diet culture. Given this store resides in USC Village, the University must implore the store to replace its sign with a different one. 
USC and Face Haus can easily accomplish their goals — encouraging students to cut down on waste and attracting new customers, respectively — by having signs that simply do not promote an unhealthy eating lifestyle. 
While amending signs may be a simple one-step fix, USC must also reassess any implications of including clothing stores such as Kaitlyn in USC Village. Kaitlyn offers limited clothing sizes, with its options ranging from x-small to large and pant sizes of 24 to 27. Aside from Lululemon, which offers plus-size activewear, and Target, Kaitlyn is the only store that sells women’s clothing in USC Village. 
Given that Kaitlyn does not offer plus-size options, the boutique inherently ostracizes anyone who doesn’t fit into its restrictive sizes. Because this store is housed in USC Village, it insinuates that USC doesn’t prioritize body diversity as the one clothing store it offers doesn’t even include plus-size clothing. To rectify this situation, USC can offer stores or pop-up shops that offer a more diverse range of clothing sizes. 
USC can also make a more concerted effort to create a body-positive atmosphere by hosting seminars where nutrition experts give information about eating disorders or posting signs around campus that promote self-love and self-confidence. 
In a world where eating disorders and body concerns are particularly prevalent, USC should unequivocally help students adopt a more body-positive mindset — not fuel the problem.
