Interim President Wanda Austin announced Thursday that the University is taking multiple remedial actions in the wake of an FBI investigation unsealed Tuesday about an alleged college admissions scam involving USC and several other universities in a memo sent to the USC community. 
The Board of Trustees was briefed by Austin Thursday morning regarding the University’s actions, the memo said. The actions come after the FBI  released charging documents that revealed over 50 celebrities, executives and professors allegedly bribed athletic administrators, coaches and college entrance exam proctors to ensure their child would be accepted to universities like USC, UCLA, Stanford and Yale, among others between 2011 and 2019. 
“These recent revelations run counter to our values, which prioritize admissions based on merit and opportunity for all qualified candidates,” Austin wrote. “Our record of diversity among students selected for admission is a particular point of pride for me.”
In the email, Austin announced that the University has launched an internal investigation into the scheme and will continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice investigation. The University has also begun identifying donations that were made in connection with the scam and will look to redirect the funds to create scholarships for underserved students, according to the memo. 
“Moving forward, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard the integrity of our admissions process and to ensure we conduct ourselves with integrity and ethics consistent with our values,” Austin wrote. 
Austin announced that USC rescinded and denied admission to applicants in the current 2019 admissions cycle who are connected to the allegations.
Additionally, Austin announced that the University will initiate a case-by-case review of current students and alumni who may have been connected to the scheme. 
“We will make informed decisions about those cases as the reviews are completed,” Austin wrote. “USC’s Office of Professionalism and Ethics, Student Affairs and Admissions and Enrollments are conferring on this process to ensure the University follows the appropriate course.”
Homayoun Zadeh, a USC dentistry professor, was placed on leave after being named in the federal indictment, the memo said. Zadeh allegedly plotted to bribe former senior associate athletics director Donna Heinel to admit his daughter as a lacrosse recruit, though she never played the sport. 
Heinel and water polo coach Jovan Vavic were terminated Tuesday for their involvement in the scheme.
“This leave is a required procedural step in the process for terminating tenured faculty,” Austin wrote. “More employment actions may be possible as new facts come to light.”

USC will hold a memorial Tuesday for Victor McElhaney, a senior who studied music, in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom from 6 to 8:30 p.m. McElhaney died March 10 in Los Angeles from a gunshot wound to the head, the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office confirmed. He was 21.
“Victor was a son of Oakland,” his mother, Oakland District 3 Councilwoman Lynette Gibson McElhaney, wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “He was a musician who drew his inspiration from the beat, soul and sound of the Town and he belonged in every nook and cranny of Oakland.”
McElhaney was approached by three to four suspects around 12:24 a.m. Sunday during a possible failed robbery attempt at Maple Avenue and Adams Boulevard, the Los Angeles Police Department said. One of the suspects shot McElhaney, and the suspects fled the scene in a vehicle. McElhaney was taken to a hospital by the Los Angeles Fire Department shortly thereafter, where he died later that morning, according to the LAPD.
An LAPD investigation into the matter is ongoing, and no arrests have been made as of Sunday.
Interim President Wanda Austin sent a memo informing the USC community of McElhaney’s death. Austin offered her condolences to his friends and family in her email. 
“He believed in the power of music to touch lives, to heal and to bring hope,” the email read.
McElhaney was part of the Jazz Studies program at the Thornton School of Music and was interested in the relationship between music and social and political movements, Austin said. He was also dedicated to community service — he was a mentor for young musicians and taught at the Oakland Public Conservatory of Music, the email read.
Peter Erskine, the director of Drumset Studies at Thornton and one of McElhaney’s instructors, said in an email to the Daily Trojan that McElhaney was an active participant at the school.
“Victor was already playing at a professional level when he came to USC,” Erskine said. “His audition was a welcome breath of fresh air — he had the touch, the feel and the musical understanding of a seasoned jazz musician … Victor was always the first to volunteer to play in any group class.”
Thornton jazz studies adjunct instructor Kathleen Grace said McElhaney was her student for a year.
“He was full to the brim with musical ideas that he wanted to share,” Grace said in a statement. “There was a spark in his eyes at all times, and an openness to all the world had to teach him.” 
Thornton also set up a website for students and other USC community members to submit photos and remembrances of McElhaney ahead of the memorial event.
McElhaney transferred to USC from Cal State, East Bay in 2017. Beyond music, he was also involved at the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs at USC, Austin’s email read.
CBCSA sent a statement to its mailing list about McElhaney’s death March 10.
“Whether it was through his music or through his conversation, he challenged others and himself to think outside of the box,” the CBCSA email read. 
As a councilwoman, McElhaney’s mother has actively fought gun violence in Oakland. She helped pass laws like Measure Z, a public safety initiative that funded prevention strategies against gun violence, according to the City of Oakland’s website.
“We are beginning a new chapter in this reoccurring circle of violence,” she wrote. “And it will take all of us together to make it through this tragedy.” 
Berkeley-based organization Building Opportunities for Self-Sufficiency created a GoFundMe fundraising page on behalf of McElhaney’s family on Monday, according to the site. The organization is a nonprofit that fights homelessness and community violence in the East Bay.
As of Monday, the page has raised over $70,810, surpassing its original $30,000 fundraising goal and its $50,000 stretch goal. Donations included a $10,000 contribution from the Oakland Athletics, according to the GoFundMe page.
“Funds will be used to assist the McElhaney Family with final arrangements and a memorial concert in honor of Victor McElhaney and the families of victims of gun violence,” the GoFundMe page said.

An article in The Hollywood Reporter Wednesday alleged that the School of Cinematic Arts admitted hedge fund manager Steven Cohen’s daughters in 2014 because of a $5 million donation made by Cohen’s foundation. However, according to spokespeople for Cohen and the School of Cinematic Arts, those allegations are false. 
The claim came after an FBI investigation was unsealed Tuesday that found 50 celebrities and executives bribed coaches and faculty at universities including USC to ensure their children would be admitted. 
The Steven and Alexandra Cohen Foundation made the $5 million donation in September 2014. According to a School of Cinematic Arts spokesperson, Cohen’s daughters were previously admitted in March 2014. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the School of Cinematic Arts said the school is grateful for financial gifts from any donors including alumni, parents and families that help students attend the school. The statement also said students’ admission to the school is not based on financial donations. 
“The admission of any given student is not dependent on such gifts,” the statement read. “Currently, 70 to 80 percent of our students receive the benefit of some financial assistance. The narrative put forth in The Hollywood Reporter is simply untrue.”
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Cohens said the foundation’s donation did not help their children earn admission to USC. 
“Steve and Alex have been generous philanthropists to a broad range of educational and cultural institutions,” the spokesperson said. “Their children earned admission to USC on the merits and any suggestion otherwise is false.”
The $5 million donation from the Cohen Foundation established a need-based scholarship to encourage students with financial struggles to pursue their interests in the film industry.
 “These funds have and continue to afford numerous students the support they need to receive an education in the Cinematic Arts,” the statement from the School of Cinematic Arts read.

Four students and three parents have filed a class action lawsuit against USC, UCLA, Stanford, Yale and several other universities claiming they were denied fair opportunities for admission Thursday, according to the complaint obtained by the Daily Trojan. 
The suit follows an FBI investigation that uncovered a nationwide college admissions scam at several universities, including USC.
The suit alleges that, while the students were qualified applicants, they were rejected by various schools involved in the investigation because the admissions processes at the universities failed to fairly consider the students for admission.
“Each of the qualified, rejected students was damaged by the fraudulent and negligent conduct of the Defendants in that, at a minimum, each Class member paid college admission application fees to the Defendant universities without any understanding or warning that unqualified students were slipping in through the back door of the admissions process,” the lawsuit read.
Along with USC and Stanford, the University of San Diego, the University of Texas at Austin, Wake Forest University, Georgetown University and Yale are named as defendants. 
“We believe the lawsuit filed by the students against Stanford is without merit,” Stanford Media Relations wrote in a statement. “We take the issues raised through the events of this week very seriously. While we continue to closely examine our policies and processes to see if improvements should be made, we stand behind the integrity of our admissions process.”
Businessman William “Rick” Singer Wednesday, was also named as a defendant in the suit.
Singer ran The Edge College and Career Network, a for-profit college counseling company accused of running the student-athlete scam which saw over 20 students admitted to USC under false pretenses of being recruited athletes. 
The suit also stated that, while each university described their admission processes as fair and based on merit on their websites, this was not true in the actual admission decisions. The suit claims the universities knew or should have known about the college admissions scam because the funding went to university accounts or prominent officials. 
According to the FBI investigation charging documents, over 50 celebrities, executives and professors participated in a racketeering scheme in which payments were made to Universities by parents to grant their children entry to Universities under false pretenses.
USC declined to comment on the suit at the time of publication.
According to the lawsuit, the universities violated the California Unfair Competition Law, which prohibits false advertising among other anti-competitive practices.
“To represent to students that the application process is based on merit, while simultaneously turning a blind eye to rampant bribery going on with the university’s employees, constitutes a violation of the UCL,” the lawsuit read.
Tulane University student Lauren Fidelak, a plaintiff in the suit who had a 4.0 high school GPA and an ACT score of 34, was rejected from USC and UCLA, according to the lawsuit.
“She was so upset that she did not get into her chosen schools that she had an emotional breakdown and needed to be hospitalized,” the lawsuit read. 
The suit claims all students or their parents paid admissions fees between $50 and $100 to each university without knowledge of the “bribery scheme” that was exposed by the FBI investigation Wednesday. Stanford student Kalea Woods, who also applied to and was rejected by USC, wouldn’t have applied if she knew about the scandal, the lawsuit alleged. 
“Had [Woods] known that the system at USC was warped and rigged by fraud, she would not have spent the money to apply to the school,” the lawsuit read. “She also did not receive what she paid for — a fair admissions consideration process.” 
Woods and Stanford student Erica Olson were the original plaintiffs in the suit, but Olson has since dropped out. 
While there are currently seven plaintiffs, the suit stated that based on the number of students rejected each year by each university in the investigation, thousands more could join the class action.
This story will be updated.
