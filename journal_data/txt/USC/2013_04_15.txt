Miscellaneous incidents 
at 10:44 p.m. on April 14, DPS officers responded to a student who reported that she sustained a scratch to her hand during a confrontation with another student. The reporting student did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter and did not require medical treatment.
at 1:25 a.m. on April 14, DPS officers and LAFD Unit #1 responded to a Blanche and Frank R. Seaver Student Residence Hall third floor fire alarm activation due to smoke from burnt food. No fire was found. LAFD reset the alarm and then cleared the building for re-entry.
at 10:49 p.m. on April 13, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect sleeping on a couch inside the School of Cinematic Arts and detained him for investigation. The officers determined that the suspect had no legitimate business on campus and was currently homeless. The officers then transported the suspect to a local hotel and released him.
at 1:58 p.m. on April 13, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated non-USC male who passed out in the lobby of the Centennial Apartments. The male was incoherent when awakened by the officers, so an LAFD RA unit was requested. RA unit #10 responded and examined the male, then transported him to California Hospital for medical treatment.
at 8:08 p.m. on April 12,  DPS officers responded to a student who was cited to Judicial Affairs for possession of a fake ID.
at 9:52 A.m. on April 12, DPS officers responded to a report of a student spending the night in his girlfriend’s apartment at Tuscany Apartments in violation of building policy. The officers contacted the student and his girlfriend, advised them of the policy and requested that he leave the premises. The student complied without incident and the officers cleared the scene.
crimes against property
at 6:13 a.m. on April 15, DPS officers responded to a suspect who used a marking pen to write graffiti on the walls of a first floor restroom of the Mark Taper Hall of Humanities.
at 8:29 p.m. on April 13, a non-USC male backed an electric cart into a staff member’s vehicle on Childs Way and McClintock Avenue, causing minor damage to the staff member’s vehicle.
at 7:45 p.m. on April 13, DPS officers responded to a student who injured his leg while playing basketball in the Lyon Center. An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #826 responded. The RA Unit treated the student and then transported him to California Hospital for additional medical treatment.
at 9:40 p.m. on April 12, DPS officers on routine patrol observed a suspect tagging the front door of a business near 37th Street and Grand Avenue and detained him for investigation. The suspect was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
at 7:56 A.m. on April 12, DPS officers responded to a report that a staff member drove a university tram into a student’s vehicle on 30th Street and Vermont Avenue, causing minor damage to both of them.
crimes against a person
at 4:31 p.m. on April 13, DPS officers responded to a report that a suspect obtained a student’s personal information by calling her and impersonating an employee from her bank at 1142 37th St. The suspect then used the information to make multiple unauthorized withdrawls from the student’s bank account.
at 5:26 p.m. on April 12, DPS officers responded to a student who was struck by a vehicle while riding her bicycle on 29th and Hoover streets. The student sustained minor bruises to her leg, but she did not desire medical treatment and was released at the scene. LAPD officers were requested and responded by conducting a traffic investigation.
 
Attention Building Tenants:  You may not overnight bang your own girlfriend in Tuscany Apartments.  Cuddling and spooning is also a violation of building policy as part of an overnight stay.   There is no current policy on overnight gay encounters but management is currently drafting one which will be posted in the lobby by Friday night.

Mike Daniels, adjunct broadcast journalism professor and a longtime news writer for KNXT/KCBS-TV Channel 2, died Thursday after a prolonged battle with cancer. He was 76.
“Mike Daniels was a cherished member of the journalism school family — a warm friend and an extraordinary teacher. This loss is a powerful blow to all of us,” Geneva Overholser, director of the Annenberg School of Journalism, said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
Joe Saltzman, the director of Annenberg’s Image of the Journalist in Popular Culture and an award-winning broadcast journalist, was a longtime friend of Daniels. The two met when they were both worked for Channel 2 newsroom in 1965, and Saltzman noted Daniels’ warm spirit.
Daniels, who was born on May 27, 1936, graduated from USC in 1958 with a degree in telecommunications. In his senior year, he began his career at KNXT/KCBS-TV, where he went on to work as a news producer and manager for almost 40 years.
“The news director had told Mike that as soon as he brought me up to speed producing the show, he could get off the overnight,” Saltzman said. “We worked on news shows together for the next two years and have been friends ever since. When I left CBS [in 1974] to come to USC to create the broadcasting sequence, he was the first one I called to teach in the new program — television news production — and he has been teaching ever since.”
Daniels earned several prestigious awards for journalism throughout his career, including several Emmys and Golden Mikes.
“All hell could be breaking around him, complete chaos with people screaming and running around, but Mike would sit there in the eye of the newsroom hurricane quietly and patiently putting the newscast together,” Saltzman said. “He never lost his cool or his temper and was a calming force in any breaking-news situation.”
Not only did Daniels contribute to the field of journalism, Saltzman said he influenced popular culture as well, Saltzman said. The professor was friends with the brother of the playwright Neil Simon, and Daniels inspired Simon to create the well-known character Felix in the play The Odd Couple, which was later adapted into a TV show.
In addition to teaching courses at Annenberg and Loyola Marymount University, Daniels was in charge of a student internship program at KCBS.
Daniels’ colleagues and friends said they will remember him not only for his journalistic excellence but also for his passion for teaching.
“I really think Mike would like to be remembered as a teacher, as someone who loved students,” Saltzman said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “I think he would like to be remembered as a man who was kind and generous whether it be on land or on the ocean with his time, his money and his love.”
Friends also said they would remember him for his love of sailing. His close friends affectionately referred to him as “Skipper Daniels,” a play off the lead character from Gilligan’s Island.
Daniels had a profound impact on his students, many of whom posted remembrances on Daniels’ Facebook page following his death. Mike Runzler, a former student, said Daniels’ was a true inspiration.
“He was a great teacher, mentor and friend,” Runzler said in a statement. “I’ve got great memories both in the classroom and on the water.”
Saltzman said one of his favorite memories of Daniels at USC was seeing him surrounded by students laughing and sharing information.
“The smile on his face said it all,” Saltzman said. “He loved teaching. He loved being with young people. He loved sharing experience and information. He loved being a mentor.  I have never seen anyone enjoy students more.”
A memorial service for Daniels will be held April 21 at the California Yacht Club at 4:30 p.m. In lieu of flowers, the Daniels’ family requests that donations be made to the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism under the Mike Daniels Fund.

A student-driven open forum held Monday focused on student over the School of Dramatic Arts’ review of professors Joe Anthony and Doug Tompos, who students claimed were facing firings last week.
Teacher talk · Madeline Puzo, the dean of the School of Dramatic Arts, said the professors are under review and have not been fired. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
SDA Dean Madeline Puzo assured approximately 100 students in the Mark Taper Hall of Humanities that “no decisions have been made.” However, students were still mightily concerned about the status of the two professors. Multiple students walked up to the stage to ask the professors questions and comment on the situation.
Many students have supported the professors online. Last week, students started a Facebook community page titled “Protest SDA firing of Joe Anthony & Doug Tompos.” As of Monday afternoon, the page has received 386 likes.
Sarah Fanella, a freshman majoring in theatre, said frustration set in when she heard rumors about the status of both professors through the online Facebook community page.
“The first time I heard that Doug or Joe had the possibility of not teaching anymore was through Facebook, and that upset me because that shouldn’t have happened”, Fanella said. “The first person that should’ve notified me was the [School of Dramatic Arts] itself. So I came here to figure out what they’re going to do to establish communication with us.”
Many students at the forum said that the university needed to reconsider their peer evaluation system. Students, such as Alexandra Jennings, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said they wanted to find out why Anthony and Tompos were currently being reviewed when she believed there is no financial risk to keep them as part-time faculty.
“These teachers have such an impactful relationship with students regardless if they’re part-time or full-time,” Jennings said. “So why are we looking for full-time faculty right now when there really isn’t much risk financially with this part-time faculty that we love so much?”
Jennings’ comments triggered a round of applause from the students in the audience.
Though many students voiced concern, professors said that no final decisions have been made regarding Anthony and Tompos’ teaching posts during the fall semester. Sharon Carnicke, a professor at the School of Dramatic Arts, told the audience that all faculty members at the school are faculty peers.
“It is a normal process of life here,” Carnicke said. “This year, Dean Puzo has decided that all of the faculty be peer-assessed. So, for the first time this year, part-time faculty members are going through what full-time faculty have always gone through.”
Jay Lee, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said that though he was inspired by Anthony and Tompos as their student, he respects SDA’s procedure and process in choosing faculty for the school.
“Doug is fantastic,” Lee said. “I would hate to lose him, but ultimately, it’s not up to him, or us — it’s ultimately up to the faculty. I’m in support of the faculty in trying to develop the best school possible however they see fit.”
Lee also said he was excited to personally communicate how he felt and hear what Puzo and administrators had to say about the matter.
“Judging by how the [forum] went, if the doors remain open, we may head in a good direction. I think the continuation of dialogue is absolutely crucial,” Lee said. “I think people need to really listen and understand the importance and the weight of what the faculty is telling us because I think too often we’re clouded by our own judgments.”
I think that the students in SDA need to be more concerned that Angus Fletcher got fired. I don’t know about Doug, but I think that Joe was a little out of line in calling students to request that they fight for his job. It sounds like Joe was offered classes next year, he just didn’t want them because they didn’t fit his schedule. But the fact that Angus Fletcher, who has earned great student popularity because of his open line of communication and support of experimental, rule-breaking ideas, has been fired  due to what seems to be purely petty politics on the university’s end, should be what raises a red flag that something beyond SDA is wrong. One of Fletcher’s main goals was to create conversation and collaboration between all the schools at USC, which would of course include the theatre school and the cinema school, something many SDA students wish for. I think that the university had a problem with such an idea is cause for major concern and questioning. I think we should have a forum to discuss why Angus Fletcher was fired. Joe and Doug still have jobs, maybe not at the times they want, but they’re not fired. However, Angus was trying to change the school for the better and got fired for it. To me, that’s more important than whether or not Doug and Joe will be full time staff next year.

While the acceptance rate for admitted undergraduate students increased, the university had more applicants, admitted more out-of-state and international students and remained fairly consistent in its acceptance of underrepresented applicants, according to statistics released by the university Monday.
This year, the Office of Admission accepted 9,304 of 47,279 applicants for a class size of 2,650 students. USC reported an admission rate of 19.7 percent. Last year, USC reported that it admitted 18 percent (or about 8,265) of 45,917 applicants for the same projected class size.
Timothy Brunold, the university’s dean of admission, said the incoming class is a very competitive group of students.
“USC’s fall 2013 entering freshman class is shaping up to be the most impressive in the university’s 133-year history,” Brunold told USC News. “The group of students we have selected is characterized by unprecedented levels of diversity: ethnic, geographic and socioeconomic. I am confident that our faculty will be pleased to teach this incredibly bright, talented and impressive group of young adults.”
Though the acceptance rate seems to have gone up, other measures of admitted students’ academic achievements are largely the same. Admitted students for the classes of 2016 and 2017 school years mostly come from the top 10 percent of their high school’s graduating class; for both, 75 percent have test scores at or above the 95th percentile. USC also reported the same average unweighted high school GPA for this and last year’s accepted students: 3.82 on a 4.00 scale.
USC’s slow-but-steady increase in the percentage of out-of-state students has not waned. About 45 percent of admitted students are in-state, compared to 47 percent last year. The current sophomore class was USC’s first-ever class of 2015 to have less than half of its student hail from California, at 49 percent.
The number of admitted international students has increased by 4 percent from last year, rising to 17 percent. With international offices in India, China and Brazil, the admissions office has been gradually increasing efforts to reach more students worldwide, as reported in previous Daily Trojan articles.
While geographic diversity is increasing, racial diversity has remained nearly constant between this and last year’s admitted students statistics. The percentage of the admitted class that identified as Asian dropped from 30 percent to 26 percent and the percent of the admitted class that identified as black increased from 6 percent to 7 percent. The percentage of admitted students that identified as Latino or Native American/Pacific Islander stayed the same, at 12 percent and 2 percent, respectively.
The university reported that it accepted more first-generation college students than most other private university in the country, with 11 percent of admitted students being the first in their family to attend college, compared to 12 percent last year. USC enrolls 3,398 first-generation students as of fall 2012, or 19 percent of all undergraduates.
The most-represented metropolitan areas in the U.S. outside California are nearly the same compared to last year, though Dallas and Boston are now better represented than Washington, D.C. The most represented foreign countries for undergraduates are still China, South Korea, India and Canada.
it’s actually true.. it was 18% last year when NOT counting the spring admits.  it was 20% with them so it is 19.7% with spring admits this time around.
This information is incorrect and that this article is still up is a shame and embarrassment for the Daily Trojan.
Check your numbers, this article is factually incorrect.
Max’ little social experiment lives on.
Long live affirmative action!
20% was the acceptance rate last year

Despite losing the weekend series to No. 9 Arizona State, the USC baseball team heads into an afternoon game at Loyola Marymount with a certain amount of good vibes partly thanks to junior left-hander Sean Silva.
Silva was named the Pac-12 pitcher of the week after allowing only one hit over six innings in his second-ever career start on Friday against ASU. Silva’s strong outing set up freshman right-hander Brent Wheatley to contribute three hitless innings in relief and led the Trojans to a 5-0 victory. The combined one-hitter is a feat that hasn’t been accomplished at USC since 1996.
“We’re going to need more of that from him,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said about Silva’s start.
In fact, the Trojans are going to need more of that dominance in the clutch from another pitcher, but Hubbs doesn’t know who that will be yet.
Silva stepped in for the start to replace injured junior pitcher Bob Wheatley, and the resulting substitutions have left the midweek starter slot to be determined on a week-to-week basis. As of Monday afternoon, Hubbs still didn’t know who he was going to send to the mound against the Lions.
“If I had to guess right now I’d say [freshman Brooks] Kriske, but I don’t know yet,” Hubbs said. “I’m working on it.”
Kriske made his first start last month against Louisville and has a 3.31 ERA over just 16.1 innings of work, primarily out of the bullpen. Hubbs also tossed around Brent Wheatley’s name in consideration.
In any case, USC will be testing its luck on the dish Wednesday, and the rest of the team’s strategy similarly relies on a series of ifs.
“If we throw strikes and are able to mix and match, I think we’re going to be in good shape,” Hubbs said. “Sometimes you just don’t know how those Tuesdays are going to pan out.”
But uncertainty and hypotheticals don’t end there. The team is currently licking its wounds after starting pitchers who surrendered dreaded “big innings.”
Against Cal State Fullerton, the Trojans jumped ahead to an early 2-0 lead, only to give up six runs in the next inning in what would be a 6-4 loss. In the rubber match against the Sun Devils on Sunday, USC allowed a five-run second inning, ultimately losing 6-5. The effect that those two innings had on the outcomes of the games speaks for itself.
“If we limit that to one or two runs, we win the game both times,” Hubbs said.
In both “big-inning” games, the Trojans let the game slip away early but were able to fight back each time and cut the deficit to within a couple of runs. Even if it showcases the team’s resilience, those come-from-behind situations are ones Hubbs prefers to avoid, especially since most of them occur because of missed opportunities.
In compliance with the ongoing theme of the season, USC left runners stranded on third base with fewer than two outs multiple times in Sunday’s loss and were only able to plate one run on a sacrifice fly with the bases loaded and no outs. For the time being, that clutch hit remains elusive.
“If we get that big hit instead of that sac fly, we win the game,” Hubbs said.
It’s not enough for the Trojans to say they can turn things around if everything goes right. The same could be said for any team. Instead, what USC needs is consistent performance.
And there’s reason for hope. Some young players are starting to step out of that “if” shadow and show that they have more than just the potential to do well.
Hubbs praised freshmen outfielders Timmy Robinson, who went 2-for-4 on Sunday and knocked in the team’s first run, and Turner Clouse for his competitive at-bats.
“We’re getting a lot of production out of younger players, guys we’re going to have back next year,” Hubbs said.
The keys for the game against LMU — and for the rest of the season for that matter — are to capitalize on their consistency and continue to repeat their successes.
The Trojans don’t know yet which pitcher they’ll be behind on the mound tomorrow but will take the field at 3 p.m. regardless.
Hubbs must have been asleep when Turner Close looked ridiculous at bat in the seventh with the bases
loaded and no outs. He struck out with a less than halfhearted swing against a lefty when a pinch hitter
should have been used. Some good players coming back next season hopefully with a new Coach.

The line of reasoning for hiring Cynthia Cooper-Dyke as USC’s next women’s basketball coach is pretty simple.
She’s an alumna and a “USC basketball icon,” as Athletic Director Pat Haden put it last Thursday when the hire was announced.
That is, of course, true. If there was a Mount Rushmore for USC women’s basketball, Cooper-Dyke’s face would be sculpted into the granite alongside that of other program greats, such as Cheryl Miller and Lisa Leslie.
While at USC, Cooper-Dyke won two NCAA championships as a member of the 1983 and 1984 teams. During her four seasons on campus, the Women of Troy compiled a 114-15 mark.
After leaving the college ranks, the Los Angeles native and Locke High School graduate won an Olympic gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Summer Games, in addition to four WNBA titles as a member of the Houston Comets.
Now, she’s a member of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame and returning to Southern California.
“If you were to ask me what my dream job was at any point in my coaching career, I would always have said my dream is to come back and lead the USC women’s basketball team,” she said during a conference call with reporters Friday.
This is the type of language you hear when schools hire an alum. From the coach, you hear about “dream jobs.” From the school, you hear about how he or she “understands the culture” and “knows what it will take to win here.” They know the people and the place, and they’ve done it before, or so the statements go.
In essence, that’s what is happening here. And it goes without saying that this will be the talk today when Cooper-Dyke is formally introduced as head coach at an afternoon reception at the Galen Center.
But is that all enough? That’s the risk, really, that USC takes. It’s banking on the fact it’ll strike gold with the Hall of Fame guard, who is returning home following coaching stints at upstart programs Texas Southern, UNC Wilmington and Prairie View A&M. Is that enough to resuscitate a program that has not appeared in the NCAA tournament since 2006? Time will tell, naturally.
The enthusiasm to turn things around, though, is there. The playing pedigree is there too. Then again, are the coaching chops sound enough? Is it at all concerning that she has not yet held a gig at an upper-echelon Division I program?
Because, to be fair, USC’s women’s hoops is an upper-echelon job. It’s a storied program. It boasts two NCAA championships from the mid-1980s. It also generates quite a bit of revenue: $2.71 million, according to documents filed with the U.S. Department of Education last October, making it USC’s biggest money maker when it comes to women’s athletics. But it’s struggled as of late on the court. And these recent struggles are largely because Cooper-Dyke’s predecessor never quite got it done.
Sure, Michael Cooper’s tenure at USC never exactly took off. The former Lakers guard went 72-57 in four years, including an 11-20 finish last season. The Women of Troy never reached the NCAA tournament and secured a postseason berth just once (a trip to the WNIT Finals in 2011).
You sensed Cooper was never “all in,” as if somehow coaching at USC was beneath him after working as an NBA assistant and then as a championship coach with the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA. Or perhaps he was more interested in making appearances as a basketball analyst on ABC Channel 7.
But for Cooper-Dyke, who describes the ’SC coaching gig as her dream job, there won’t be any questions about effort or interest. Nobody will question her familiarity with USC or her urgency to coach a winning program. You expect her to be all-in, to help the Women of Troy return to prominence, to compete with Pac-12 heavyweights Cal and Stanford.
“Some people, when they hire a coach, the athletic department hits a home run,” Van Chancellor, Cooper-Dyke’s coach at the WNBA’s Houston Comets, said in a statement. “Southern California has hit a grand slam, with two out and down three with the bases loaded. They hit it out of the park. This is one of the greatest hires. She’s the perfect fit.”
Alumni returning to their schools to coach will always make for nice copy and for heartwarming feature stories in local newspapers. Cooper-Dyke’s return definitely falls under that category.
And so the obvious question stands: Will it be anything more than a short-lived honeymoon?
It’s often a fruitless exercise to immediately grade coaching hires. But perhaps ’SC fans can rest easy knowing that if Cooper-Dyke tastes success with the program, it won’t be her first time.
 
“The 19th Hole” runs on Tuesdays. To comment on this story, email Joey at jrkaufma@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
It is hard to believe that the program generated 2.7 million with attendance being pathetic for almost every
home game. The ucla game had around 700 in attendance which is an all time low. They must have lost
money overall with travel expenses and of course Cooper’s high salary. The best hire who really knows
until a couple of years go by with the results known. Indication for me is a top five recruiting class or a super
player like Griner of Baylor to put interest back into this sport.

As Adam Scott and Angel Cabrera’s nail-biting playoff was coming to a close at Augusta National on Sunday afternoon, the USC men’s and women’s golf teams were looking to pick up important victories of their own.
Leading man · USC senior Sam Smith turned in the best performance of the weekend for the struggling Trojans, finishing in a tie for No. 12. – Courtesy of USC Sports Information Dept.
 
Unfortunately for the men’s squad, which was seeking its first win since late February, a victory was not in the cards. The women’s team suffered a similar fate, as it finished outside the top-five after three consecutive first place finishes.
The men’s team once again finished outside the top five at the Western Intercollegiate at Pasatiempo Golf Course in Santa Cruz, Calif., ending up in sixth.
Senior Sam Smith continued his consistent play, once again coming in as the team’s lowest scorer. He finished in a tie for No. 12, however, and this was not enough to push USC into contention.
Top-ranked California ran away with the tournament, just as they did at the last meeting between the two squads at the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Pedro Figueiredo of No. 5 UCLA won this weekend’s individual title, leading his team to a second-place finish. No. 9 Stanford, No. 4 Washington and unranked San Diego State rounded out the top five.
Smith got off to a hot start during Saturday’s two rounds of action with seven birdies through the first 36 holes, putting him and the Trojans in contention heading into Sunday. Unfortunately, an outstanding performance from Cal, coupled with less-than-stellar play from USC, sunk the Trojans’ hopes.
Smith finished 2-over for the tournament, with his excellent first day offset by a final round 5-over 75. Freshman Yi Keun Chang sent in the next best score, tying for 29th with an 8-over finish.
USC head coach Chris Zambri recognized that his squad did not play its best golf.
“The team struggled this week, especially on and around the greens,” Zambri said. “But we have a clear idea of what we need to improve on.”
For the Women of Troy, the weekend also had its share of struggles. The No. 1 USC women’s golf team headed to the PING/Arizona State Invitational last weekend looking to win its fourth straight event, a feat only accomplished in USC history by the 2008 squad, which won the national championship. The team’s hopes were dashed, though, as USC fell victim to an incredible final round performance from defending NCAA champion No. 2 Alabama.
The Crimson Tide erased a  four-shot deficit in the final round to overtake No. 3 Duke and claim a commanding nine-stroke victory. The Women of Troy remained in the hunt through Friday and Saturday’s rounds and headed into Sunday just eight strokes back of the Blue Devils. It was the defending champs, however, that delivered a blistering 11-under round to win the title.
USC juniors Rachel Morris and Sophia Popov tied for 10th individually at 3-under to lead the Women of Troy, six strokes behind Alabama’s Emma Talley for the individual crown. Popov was coming off of a victory at the SDSU Farms Invitational and still managed to make some history in this tournament. Her final round score of 69 was her third round in the 60s this year and the 15th of her career, tying USC’s career record held by Jennifer Song in 2008-09. Popov’s finish was her fourth consecutive in the top 10, while Morris’ tie for 10th was her second in a row. Freshman Annie Park tied for 27th at 2-over and sophomore Doris Chen tied for 38th at 4-over.
Both squads return to action at the end of the month for the     Pac-12 playoffs. On the men’s side, the tournament will be hosted April 29 through May 1 at the Los Angeles Country Club. For the women’s team, the action will start April 22 at the Valencia Country Club. Despite the players’ recent struggles, Zambri is excited about their postseason chances.
“Like March Madness, our year comes down to how we play at the end of the season,” Zambri said. “With that, we have reason to be optimistic. This is a great opportunity.”

USC head coach Lane Kiffin released the team’s post-spring depth chart on Monday, and the most noteworthy element was the decision that Kiffin has yet to make: Who will be the starting quarterback?
Undeclared · Freshman Max Browne (left) and redshirt sophomores Max Wittek (middle) and Cody Kessler remaining at equal footing in USC’s quarterback competition at the conclusion of spring practices. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
After 15 spring practices, the Trojan backfield remains unsettled. Redshirt sophomores Max Wittek and Cody Kessler and freshman Max Browne are all listed as co-starters, meaning that, as expected, the race to replace Matt Barkley will continue well into fall camp.
Though it should come as no surprise that Kiffin is in no rush to choose his next starting signal caller, there were still many significant decisions reflected on the depth chart.
USC’s backfield features another trio of starters, with three running backs vying for the top spot: senior Silas Redd, redshirt sophomore Tre Madden and upstart freshman Justin Davis.
Redd was sidelined for most of the spring while recovering from knee surgery, while Madden has yet to participate in full-contact drills since tearing his ACL last spring. In their absence, Davis took his opportunity and ran with it.
An early enrollee, the Stockton, Calif. native was the most impressive back USC had, and Kiffin made it no secret that he would get a chance to start despite his young age.
Another position of interest was the third receiver spot, and the competition, again, appears to be ongoing. With junior Marqise Lee and sophomore Nelson Agholor listed as starters at each receiver spot, senior De’Von Flournoy and freshman Darreus Rogers are currently listed as their respective backups. Redshirt sophomore wideout Victor Blackwell is listed behind Rogers, meaning he may be a step behind as the team heads into fall, despite his stellar performance in Saturday’s spring game, where he caught seven passes for 155 yards and a touchdown.
The offensive line had perhaps the biggest surprise of any of the position battles, though, as senior right tackle Kevin Graf, a two-year starter, was listed as a co-starter with redshirt freshman Chad Wheeler. Wheeler arrived at USC with a three-star ranking, according to ESPN, yet had a strong enough spring to pressure the incumbent Graf and leapfrog fellow redshirt freshman Zach Banner, who was a four-star recruit in the class of 2012.
The USC defense features an interesting blend of youth and experience. Senior defensive end-turned-outside linebacker Devon Kennard returns to a starting role after missing all of last year because of a torn pectoral muscle. Joining him up front are a host of returning starters, including sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams, redshirt junior defensive tackle George Uko and senior defensive end Morgan Breslin. The starting nose tackle position remains up for grabs with redshirt sophomores Antwaun Woods and Cody Temple sharing the honor for the time being.
Redshirt junior Hayes Pullard returns as the starting Mike linebacker, with redshirt senior Will Andrew serving as his backup. Another battle is being held at the Will linebacker position, with junior Lamar Dawson and redshirt sophomore Anthony Sarao each listed at the top.
In the secondary, many question marks still remain. Only one of the four positions has a clear-cut starter for now, with redshirt junior Anthony Brown starting at one cornerback spot. The remaining three spots each list co-starters, suggesting that Kiffin is not yet through evaluating his mostly unproven defensive backs.
Senior Demetrius Wright and freshman Leon McQuay III are at the top of the free safety position, with redshirt junior Josh Shaw and freshman Su’a Cravens in a battle for the starting spot at strong safety. Cravens shined during the first half of spring but was forced to sit out in the second half because of a knee injury. Senior Torin Harris and sophomore Kevon Seymour are co-starters at the other cornerback position.
With many spots still up for grabs, the intrigue and speculation will certainly continue to ramp up as the beginning of fall camp nears.
Wittek is still listed first, and despite LK stating that he is undecided, Wittek will start.  Just another game being  played by the head coach. He doesn’t want Cody to transfer since he has to have a back up QB.
Cody should transfer.

It’s 1993. Many current USC undergraduates aren’t even born yet. Michael Jordan is on fire. Cheers airs its last episode. Unforgiven wins the Oscar for best picture. And perhaps most important, current Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kenya Moore wins Miss USA.
But something else happened in 1993. Something that might have felt small at the time — almost as if it was just another concert: Rock band Pearl Jam performed at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, Calif. in a boycott of the concert conglomerate Ticketmaster.
Little did they know that by giving the largest ticket vendor in the world a fat middle finger, the band would be inadvertently creating the future of the modern-day music festival.
The first Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival took place in October of 1999. Beck, The Chemical Brothers, Rage Against the Machine and other acts performed in a two-day retreat to Indio.
After a few hiccups, including dealing with extreme heat and figuring out how to make a profit, festival organizers finally hit their stride in the early 2000s. Soon Coachella became the music festival to go to.
Every festival has its characteristics. At Glastonbury, fans wade in the mud in their wellies to check out their favorite punk acts. At Stagecoach, country music fans lace up their best cowboy boots and don their sharpest Stetsons. At your typical massive rave, fans decked out in their best neon look forward to jumping to beats in a crowd of thousands. At Lilibeth, (mostly) women take the term bohemian to heart and jettison bras and shoes out the window.
Coachella? Well, it’s a mix of everything — which is probably the reason why it’s so popular. With acts in the past ranging from a hologram ressurection of Tupac to Vampire Weekend to the Beastie Boys to Kanye West to Madonna, there’s a little something for everyone. Instead of dividing genres of music, the festival brings them together. Here, you’ll find your hardcore rap fan sharing a joint with the prissiest sorority girl.
This year, Coachella is no different. Phoenix brought R. Kelly onstage for a duet, Icelandic folk band Of Monsters and Men crooned its heart out and Baauer provided the beats for the largest dance party possible. And if you couldn’t tell from your Instagram newsfeed, 2013’s Coachella was a live fashion show of the best festival trends.
I once interned at an Internet startup in Downtown L.A. During my first day, my cool-but-obviously-over-the-top boss shared with me that for her, the New Year starts with Coachella — and the rest of the year fits around it.
That’s a grandiose statement to make, but unfortunately, for many who consider themselves true festival goers, the sentiment stays true. This old boss of mine spent months planning her outfits — one of her friends and fellow co-worker even based a school project around what she would wear Coachella weekend. And yes, massive angel wings were included, in case you were wondering.
People obviously go all out. But here’s the thing: It doesn’t matter if you’re rocking a sundress or a pair of wings — just wear whatever you’re happiest in.
Still, keep in mind that the festival moved from October to April for a reason. Temperature-wise, Indio is the equivalent of a rather large boiling cauldron so comfort is always key. Ever wonder why Coachella concertgoers wear so few clothes? Yes, they want to show off their flat abs and cut arms, but they’re also just trying to stay cool in impossibly hot weather.
Hair in your face? Take a hint from all of the girls in carefully woven flower headbands and boys in an assortment of fedoras and frat baseball caps. Remember: functionality and style.
That’s the hard part about writing a how-to fashion guide for something as vast and indescribable as Coachella. There’s no one theme, no one genre, no one type of person who attends the festival on either weekend. It’s too heterogeneous, and too broad to pinpoint any particular style.
Yes, fashion can be serious. Your style can tell a lot about who you are. But sometimes people can take it a little too literally. If you look like you’ve spent more time getting ready than breathing this morning, then this note is for you. As long as you go 100 percent, you can’t go wrong. Coachella isn’t about how great your makeup looks.
Forget about how good a certain shirt will appear with the Hefe Instagram filter. You can’t possibly go wrong with what to wear. Festivals are about freedom and independence. You don’t need to show your individuality to thousands of people who already know you’re special — you’re there in the first place, after all.
Most important, remember why you came. For some, maybe your whole fraternity was going. For others, maybe they just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. But for most of the festival goers, only one thing matters: being there.

Sometimes, community theater can be the r-e-a-l-e-s-t theater there is. Especially when it comes to a production such as The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, now playing at the Pierson Playhouse in Pacific Palisades.
Game on · Spellers Logianne Schwartzand (Darcy Silveira), Olive Ostrosky (Candice Courtney), Rona Lisa (Cynthia Rothschild) and Marcy Park (Kana Koinuma), left to right, break out in silly songs throughout Putnam. – Courtesy of Joy Daunis
 
Sure, the production has its share of flaws, but Putnam County is full of unfiltered adrenaline, brought to life by actors who are eager to prove that they’re just as talented as any equity actor. And the eagerness that the cast brings to their roles is especially fitting for a production that runs on childlike enthusiasm.
The musical itself is so well-written that it is virtually failproof. Set in a high school gym in Putnam County, Mass., the story follows a bizarre selection of preteens who are competing to qualify for a spot in the national spelling bee and the equally bizarre adults who supervise the competition.
The success of this script can be attributed entirely to the strength of the character development. Each kid contestant is given a hilarious concoction of social issues and a heart of gold. There’s Chip Tolentino, last year’s winner and devout Boy Scout, who is just discovering the joys of puberty. Then you have overachieving wunderkind Marcy Park, who is experiencing an early midlife crisis. That’s just the beginning, though. There is also flower child Leaf Coneybear, who suffers from low self-esteem, and William Barfée (pronounced “Bar-fay”), who has mucus problems and uses his foot to spell out words. Rounding out the cast, there’s also Logainne Schwartzandgrubenniere, who is president of her elementary school’s Gay-Straight Alliance, and lastly Olive Ostrovsky, who has distant parents and must settle for her dictionary as her close confident.
The songs are so catchy and the dialogue is so heartfelt that this show already shows signs of being a winner before the casting process has even begun. Still, the acting helps. Dorothy Blue’s performance as Leaf (who is traditionally played by a male) was highly endearing, especially when she entered the trance necessary for her character to spell. Even if some of the high notes she belted didn’t always quite seem to land, she was an audience favorite.
Similarly, Peter Miller’s interpretation of Barfée might include some questionable reaction faces, but his repeated delivery of the line “I know,” every time he is told he’s spelled a word correctly more than makes up for any awkward pauses in his other dialogue. Candice Courtney’s impressive singing voice was put to particularly good use in “The I Love You Song,” a spectacular ballad recounting her struggles with her parents and the depression that runs in her family. Brad Akerman’s rendition of the song “My Unfortunate Erection (Chip’s Lament)” might have been a tad lackluster, but there’s basically nothing any actor can do to ruin a song that brilliant.
The beauty of a musical revolving around a spelling bee is the endless opportunity for word humor. Aside from the unusual words that spellers are assigned (such as “capybara” or “hasenpfeffer”), writer Rachel Sheinkin added hilarious supplemental material to be used when spellers ask for a word’s definition or for it to be used in a sentence. For instance, when a speller is assigned the word, “Mexican,” the sentence he’s given is, “Guacamole: the Mexican pudding,” and the definition is, “A person or something hailing from or related to the country of Mexico, or an American term denoting anyone from Puerto Rico, Guam, Cuba, El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, South America or Spain.”
Another highlight is the flawless piano performance by musical director Brian Murphy. As the sole member of the orchestra, his energetic playing drove the quick pace of the show, and his tone consistently cued the actors’ emotive singing. And despite a few shortcomings in their soloing here and there, under Murphy’s direction, the actors came together to harmonize beautifully.
One final perk is that this show is heavy in audience participation. Who knows who will be called up to spell a word? The spontaneity of live theater is enhanced by the different dynamic established by random audience members.
So, is this production worth the $25 cost of admission? It really depends; any production of Spelling Bee is worth seeing, but there are some who might say it would be more fulfilling to see it done by seasoned professionals. On the other hand, why not give these everyday folks a chance? Afterall, their performances  are full of e-n-t-h-u-s-i-a-s-m.
Saw this play and Lewis Hauser’s directing is fantastic. He had the directing of the actors and music down pat. And without his great direction in this play, it might have been different, but it’s a timely playing seeing what happened in Boston Mass! Go see it, it’s fantastic!

You go out of the way for some restaurants because the food is craveworthy. Others you merely go to because it’s an option within reach.
If you build it, they will come · Customers craft their own burger experience at Built, choosing from four proteins (beef, turkey, vegan burgers or chicken breast), six cheeses, four types of buns and a multitude of toppings. – Eddie Kim | Daily Trojan
 
Built Custom Burgers, a stripped-down version of build-your-own burger joint The Counter, recently opened in Icon Plaza with hopes of being both ideals.
Unfortunately, it’s only the latter.
This is frustrating partly because Los Angeles is probably the burger capital of the world, and the laundry list of top-notch signature sandwiches seems to have no end in sight. Want old-school? How about Apple Pan, or perhaps a timeless Double-Double from In-N-Out? Want cutting edge? Check out the re-engineered, platonic-ideal burgers at Plan Check or Umami Burger. Perhaps a compromise between both worlds? Father’s Office beckons.
Then there’s Built, which infuriates because of how little it wants to prove. It has no glamour to stunt behind — the burgers are made to order in a cafeteria-style line to each diner’s specs, and there are no signature burgers to prove Built’s creative worth. And it has no ambiance — though the interior is pleasantly dressed in warm wood and modern furnishings, the oft-bustling, cramped dining area is no place to enjoy a relaxed meal.
What it does offer is the temptation of control: Here, you get to craft your own burger experience, picking from four proteins (beef, turkey or vegan burgers or chicken breast), six cheeses, four types of buns and a smorgasboard of toppings. Gluten-free and salad-bowl options are also offered.
But be warned: The base price of $6.75 for a quarter-pound burger can skyrocket quick. Specialty cheeses, including blue cheese, come at a supplemental cost (often 50 cents, as with a recent selection of manchego). You also get three toppings included, but premium options — including sauteed onions, sauteed mushrooms, avocado and bacon — require a buck more per. You get just one choice of sauce, albeit from a wide palette, with extra servings running 50 cents each.
This compares somewhat unfavorably with the nearby Five Guys, which offers two patties and an unlimited, though more concise, slate of toppings for $6.59. Granted, springing for the combo (fries and a drink) at Built also allows you to get an additional premium topping at a small discount. But a combo with a base burger still costs a little under $11.
Add a couple more toppings and you might as well go to on-campus joint Morton Fig, where the $15 burger and fries are a clear cut above fast-casual offerings.
That being said, the end results of Built’s system can be very tasty. There’s always satisfaction to be had in fresh ingredients paired with nicely cooked burgers, and it’s no different here.
The beef burger sometimes arrives handsomely charred and blushing perfectly pink in the center, the happy result of a careful grill hand. Try pairing that with Tillamook cheddar cheese, roasted red peppers, pickles and jalapenos, all smeared with a little roasted garlic aioli: a winning combination, for sure.
But more often than not, the burger arrives hungover on heat, beat helplessly against the currents of fiery propane until gray, mealy and tough. And nothing can save that, not even premium toppings or more sauce or Built’s addictive shoestring fries (cross your fingers for a fresh batch).
Ostensibly, diners don’t have much of a say in how the patties are cooked: The restaurant says its burgers are cooked medium-well, with a well-done option for the few individuals who want it. This is done because large crowds and the cafeteria setup make cooking to custom temperatures an impossibility.
But Built’s beef patties, which are considerably thicker than those at Five Guys or In-N-Out, would be juicier and more tender if served medium-rare or even medium. When the cooks err on the side of pink, eating there makes more sense. When they err on the side of well-done, it feels like a waste, both of money and of time.
Unfortunately, Built’s inconsistency and lack of flair just add to the general dining woes of the surrounding USC community. The classic joints, chiefly Chano’s, La Taquiza and La Barca, have stood the test of time (it’s no coincidence they all serve Mexican food). But otherwise, few restaurants really stick out as exceptional, as places you would aggressively suggest, time and time again, to every visiting relative and high school friend.
Consistency and a distinctive style is what makes a restaurant, and especially a burger shop, reach the divine heights of Los Angeles’ food scene. Places such as Plan Check or Umami do so by sticking to a philosophy and executing brilliantly, day-in, day-out, to transcendent results.
For now, Built resides firmly in the purgatory of the generic — neither particularly cheap, nor craveworthy, nor charmingly unique. At best, it offers decent burgers and toppings for an acceptable, if not value-oriented, price. At worst (i.e. when the burger’s overcooked), it’s a reminder not to come back, no matter how convenient the location might be.

A new bipartisan immigration bill to be officially unveiled this week offers a comprehensive plan for immigration reform — but includes stringent border-security and general enforcement measures that seem doomed to fail.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
 
The Huffington Post reported that “the [immigration] bill is expected to provide a 13-year path to citizenship for people living here illegally who qualify,” yet this would only occur after a new border-security plan is put in place.
In addition, the bill aims to have employers adopt electronic verification systems to monitor their workers’ statuses as well as have a new electronic system guarding  the border, airports and seaports to track those with temporary visas.
This proposal includes holes, costly measures, as well as several goals that might not be possible to implement within the timeframe.
One goal in the proposal is to get the U.S.-Mexico border under 100 percent surveillance and to catch 90 percent of those who cross illegally. However, this country has struggled to monitor even 50 percent of the border.
According to The Wall Street Journal,  the Department of Homeland Security reported in 2012 that it only covered about 44 percent of the border. In light of that, attempting to achieve 100-percent surveillance of the border in 13 years is completely unrealistic.
Not to mention that gauging the efficacy of border security is a tricky beast in of itself. “It is hard to know if apprehension rates are tallied accurately. You can detect something and not know for certain if it turned back or if it got past you. That’s what makes it a really tough challenge,” Thad Bingel, a former Customs and Border Protection official, said to The Wall Street Journal.
Another complication in the proposal is that it has not yet established what areas of the border are defined as “high risk.” How can enforcement occur when no one knows where to focus the efforts?
An additional goal in the proposal is expanding and enforcing employers to use a now-voluntary electronic verification system, E-Verify, to screen workers.
But according to the American Civil Liberties Union, “E-Verify could quickly create a de facto national ID system containing detailed data on everyone authorized to work in America. Your name, photo, driver’s license information, social security number, phone number, email address, employer, industry and country of birth could all be verified through a system accessible over the Internet.”
Though it has its upsides, E-Verify is a controversial system that would penetrate an individual’s right to privacy and it is not always accurate — which could create unnecessary barriers for those who legitimately seek employment.
Meeting all the goals could take more than a decade. So what will happen to those who enter the country illegally? Only those who passed a criminal background check, have paid a fine and met other conditions would receive probationary status. Activists and advocates of illegal immigrants are worried that this legislation would create more obstacles than solutions in the path to citizenship.
“It raises the question of whether it’s actually achievable, and whether it will end up thwarting the path to citizenship for 11 million people,” Frank Sharry, executive director of the group America’s Voice, told The Wall Street Journal.
How will the nation determine whether the border is “secure?” How many fences, resources, enforcement, technology and taxpayer dollars will it take to implement this proposal? How will the success of “border security” be measured? How much will immigrants pay in fees and fines for this legislation? What will ensue if the measures are not met within the timeframe?
These are all realistic questions that have yet to be answered by this idealistic proposal.

It’s not news that the job market is currently in trouble. Horror stories of layoffs and home foreclosures are common and it seems like a shocking number of people are doing all that he or she can to avoid losing employment. But how are the companies themselves dealing with having fewer employees?
“Wages are stagnant, jobs are less secure, work is more intense — it’s a much tougher world. Employers have become much more aggressive about restructuring work in ways that push for higher levels of productivity,” said Paul Osterman, co-director of the MIT Sloan Institute for Work and Employment Research, said to the Los Angeles Times.
It certainly makes sense for companies to prioritize productivity. Yet the problem is that many companies are taking their methods too far.
In the L.A. Times article “As employers push efficiency, the daily grind wears down workers,” journalist Alana Semuels reported on the disconcerting trend of employers micromanaging their employees. Examples of such micromanaging include timing bathroom breaks, tracking keystrokes and using video and software to constantly receive feedback on employee performance.
This can boost efficiency to new heights, but the effects of prioritizing productivity over employee satisfaction can hurt a company in the long run, especially as workers start to lose the will to show up each morning.
“We’re just like human machines,” Phil Richards, a warehouse worker, told the L.A. Times. “But with machines, they don’t care whether you feel good, or if you’re having a bad day. You’re always worried that you’re not doing your job correctly.”
Yet companies are willing to justify their decision-making as necessary, given the struggles with a slow economy.
These companies think that by pushing productivity for employees, they are doing what’s best for the company. The expenses saved by relentlessly prioritizing productivity can help reduce layoffs and other personnel changes, which ultimately helps employees. It can also help smaller companies compete with bigger, resource-laden businesses, which could lead to greater employment down the line for all.
Though this is a valid counterargument, it ignores the negative effect of this shift on the mentality of employees.
It might be tempting to keep such close tabs on employees, but it seems that company image and culture will almost definitely suffer as a result. And historically, when employees have felt ignored or neglected, they have resorted to worker strikes, lawsuits and even violence. In fact, in an age of social media, where everyone has a platform to speak out against a company, neglecting employees can lead to severe harm to a company’s culture and reputation.
Many companies have faced complaints about their treatment of workers, but it seems unlikely that change from this practice is imminent. For many companies, the decision to deprioritize employee comfort and push productivity is business, and not intended to be personal.
Yet, as the number of complaints increase and employees begin looking at courses of legal action against certain companies, it might become extremely personal for everyone involved.

On the second season premiere of HBO’s most comedic new comedy Veep, it’s midterm election night and it seems Vice President Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) actually helped on the campaign trail—though not enough to keep the House. I am no stranger to Armando Ianucci’s work; from The Thick of It (UK) to its spin-off feature In The Loop, he has not failed to deliver ripe political comedy featuring immature, big-mouthed political strategists.
And yet the first season of Veep resembled The Thick of It mostly in that we never lay eyes on the President or Prime Minister. The show was entertaining, but not as brilliantly biting as its English ancestor—a typical consequence of transplanting television across the pond (see The Office and House of Cards).
This season promises to deliver. Selina, more interested in her .9% positive influence on the midterms than their disastrous results, announces her plan to usurp a bit of the POTUS’s power, a goal she aptly names “the whole co-POTAL thing.” She informs new political strategist Kent (Gary Cole), “If you’re not at the table, you’re probably on the menu, and Kent, I don’t want to be eaten.”
What she does want are the simple things in life, like the lipstick color Midnight Sunrise (which makes her lips say “Carnivale!” even when her eyes say “Holocaust”), a Cartier dildo, and more influence on foreign policy. Her assistant (most recognizable as Buster Bluth) spends most of the episode locating the shade, only to accidentally grind Coral Blush onto the carpet of the Oval Office, and still later discover that Midnight Sunrise wasn’t her best shade anyway. Perfectly pitched payoff.
In a B story somewhat lifted from The West Wing, Amy’s father has a stroke (or maybe not) on election night. Perhaps the best one-liner of the evening is delivered by her (younger?) sister: “Oh my God, Amy, you work for the Vice President; it’s not like it’s Google.”
But this Veep claims to have “a big bag of leverage coming [her] way,” as she is granted more influence on foreign policy by the end of the episode. Perhaps she can use that to stop POTUS from “swinging his nuclear dick again”—a comment from a strategist that reminded me of my last favorite American political satire, Dr. Strangelove.
I can’t wait to see how Selina will ‘help hone the message’ this season. More importantly, I’m excited to see her “co-POTAL thing” play out in true Ianucci form, without ever catching a glimpse of POTUS himself.
I encountered this blog through http://dailytrojan.com/2013/04/15/midnight-sunrise-a-cartier-dildo-and-more-influence-on-foreign-policy/?
utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+DailyTrojan-rss+(Daily+Trojan) and if I may I want to point out to you some helpful things or ideas. Maybe you can write your next articles relating to these ideas. I want to read more stuff concerning what you’re talking about.

Two weeks ago, I said that the Lakers were probably going to miss the playoffs. They must have heard me, since after that they reeled off four straight and to pull one game ahead in the loss column over the Utah Jazz, while a resurgent Dirk Nowitzki wasn’t able to pull the mediocre Dallas Mavericks into the mix.
Then on Friday, Kobe Bryant fully ruptured his Achilles tendon against Golden State, sidelining him at least until the beginning of next season—perhaps even until Christmas. Anyone who saw Kobe’s minutes in the games leading up to his injury saw at least something coming: Bryant played at least 40 minutes every game in April, including 47 minutes or more four times since March 30th.
Despite the loss of Bryant, the Lakers defeated a listless San Antonio Spurs team Sunday night thanks to 23 points from Steve Blake and 26 points and 17 rebounds from Dwight Howard. Howard practically backed down the Spurs’ Tim Duncan under the rim for an easy spin-dunk move early in the first quarter, and proceeded to have one of his more dominant games all season. Howard’s athleticism and the even ball distribution allowed the Lakers to overcome Pau Gasol’s horrific three-for-17 effort from the field.
Which led me to question: What is Kobe’s impact on the Lakers, really?
I know speaking of Kobe’s possibly detrimental effects to the offense right now would be tantamount to speaking ill of the dead, but humor me for a moment. The same question came up when Dwyane Wade was injured last season for the Heat, as people asked if the Heat were a better team without Wade.
You are never a better team without one of your top scorers; in Kobe’s case the Lakers are never a better team without him. However, they might be a more efficient offense. They might establish a team identity that, with Bryant, may have been impossible because of how Kobe dominates the ball.
Another thing that Laker Nation has been a little reluctant to recognize is that Kobe’s defense has completely disappeared with age. Kobe was never an above-average help defender. He was one of the game’s premier on-the-ball defenders in his prime, and that aspect of his game was the first to go with his diminished athleticism (or dunks like this).
Which is not to say we’re going to pine for the defensive prowess of Earl Clark and Jodie Meeks when Kobe returns next year, but you get the point. Kobe’s absence might do more good for the players who are on the court right now (I’m including Steve Nash, who might return Wednesday) in finding a rhythm offensively.
The Mamba himself admitted next season would be his swan song, but what of the Lakers beyond next season? Wouldn’t it be important for players like Dwight Howard to get situated and find a comfort zone in the offense; something that, despite his 17 points per game average, he hasn’t seemed able to do all season? Kobe’s absence could lead to players finding their niches in coach Mike D’Antoni’s system and maybe, just maybe, making some noise in this year’s playoffs. I know.

While the acceptance rate for admitted undergraduate students increased, the university had more applicants, admitted more out-of-state and international students and remained fairly consistent in its acceptance of underrepresented applicants, according to statistics released by the university today.
This year, the admissions office accepted 9,304 of 47,279 applicants for a class size of 2,650 students.This is a 19.7 percent admission rate, which USC said is lower than last year’s final admission rate. Last year, USC reported that it admitted 18 percent (or about 8,265) of 45,917 applicants  for the same projected class size.
Though the acceptance rate seems to have gone up, other measures of admitted students’ academic achievements are the same. Admitted students for the 2013 and 2012 school years mostly come from the top 10 percent of their high school’s graduating class; for both, 75 percent have test scores at or above the 95th percentile. USC also reported the same average un-weighted high school GPA for this and last year’s accepted students: 3.82/4.0.
USC’s slow-but-steady increase of out-of-state students has not waned. About 45 percent of admitted students are in-state, compared to 47 percent last year. The current sophomore class was, in fall 2011, USC’s first-ever class to have less than half of its student hail from California, at 49 percent.
The number of admitted international students has increased by 4 percent from last year, rising to 17 percent. USC has opened international offices in India and China two years ago and an office in Brazil this year, and the admissions office has been gradually increasing efforts to reach more students worldwide, according to previous Daily Trojan articles.
While geographic diversity is increasing, racial diversity has remained nearly constant between this and last years’ admitted students statistics. The percentage of the admitted class that identified as Asian dropped from 30 percent to 26 percent and the number of the admitted class that identified as black increased from 6 percent to 7 percent. The percentage of admitted students that identified as Latino or Native American/Pacific Islander stayed the same, at 12 percent and 2 percent respectively.
The university reports that it has the most first-generation college students of any private university in the country. This year, 11 percent of admitted students would be the first in their family to attend college, compared to 12 percent last year. USC enrolls 3,398 first-generation students as of fall 2012, or 19 percent of all undergraduates.
The most-represented metropolitan areas in the U.S. outside California are nearly the same compared to last year, though Dallas and Boston are now better represented than Washington, D.C. The most represented foreign countries for undergraduates are still China, South Korea, India and Canada.

USC head coach Dan Hubbs calls them “nothing outs,” and it’s tough to describe in words exactly how frustrated they make him.
The Trojans may have only had six hits in Sunday’s rubber match against No. 15 Arizona State, but that didn’t mean they lacked chances to score. And at no time did they have a better chance then with the bases loaded and no outs in the seventh inning, trailing 6-4. Having battled back from a 6-0 deficit, USC looked poised to at least tie the game and maybe even take the lead. But a strikeout, a sacrifice fly and another flyout plated just one. Talk about “nothing” outs.
“It’s just unfortunate,” Hubbs said of the Trojans’ lack of clutch execution. “We had the guys we want up in the key spots. We had plenty of opportunities to win that game.”
The Trojans were victims of six strikeouts and too many weak ground balls and lame infield pop outs to count, dropping the final game of the weekend series to the Sun Devils 6-5 on Sunday afternoon, in front of 1,151 fans and a national TV audience on ESPNU.
The Trojans fell early and fell behind big, as freshman pitcher Kyle Twomey simply didn’t have his best stuff. Twomey got smacked around for five runs in the second inning, with every ball hit hard off the bat. He was removed in favor of fellow freshman Kyle Davis, who threw a clutch four innings of one-run ball.
It looked for a while, however, that Davis’ effort would be all for naught. Arizona State starter Alex Blackford carried a no-hitter into the fifth inning against the Trojans when the game suddenly changed.
Trailing 6-0 with two outs, freshman outfielder Timmy Robinson smacked the Trojans first hit of the game through the hole on the right side, scoring freshman shortstop Blake Lacey, who had walked and stolen second. Robinson then swiped second himself.
With another precious runner in scoring position, sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs struck out swinging on a ball in the dirt, but the ASU catcher RJ Ybarra threw the ball away as Stubbs ran to first. Robinson came charging around third to score and Stubbs was safe. After another single, freshman designated hitter Bobby Stahel lined a clutch double down the left field line to score a pair and cut the Sun Devil lead to 6-4, and the Trojans were all of the sudden in business.
“We have a lot of guys who can come up big,” said Stubbs, who finished 1-for-3 and was stranded at second as the tying run to end the game. “But the thing is that we need to do it earlier in the game. It sucks to come out in the last inning and have the pressure, where earlier in the game you’ll have a few more opportunities.”
Even after squandering a golden opportunity in the seventh, the Trojans threatened with a runner on in the eight and again with two on in the ninth, but ultimately couldn’t push that final run across.
“I told the guys, you got to love to play these kind of games,” Hubbs said. “Where it’s your heart in your throat and every play is a big play, and every pitch is a big pitch. I love these kind of games. That was a regional-type game, and that’s what we need to get accustomed to.”
With momentum from a one-hit shutout in the opener on Friday night, USC couldn’t sustain the dominance on Saturday. The Sun Devils jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead in the first inning and never trailed in the game. USC got one back in the bottom of the third, but ASU bounced right back for two more of their own in the top of the fourth. The Trojan bats were ready, with 10 hits in the game, but they stranded a runner in scoring position in five of the first six innings.
It was a sharp contrast to Friday night, when USC played one of its most complete games of the season. Junior Sean Silva and freshman Brent Wheatley combined to throw a complete game, one-hit shutout against a powerful Sun Devil lineup. Silva tossed the first six, with Wheatley closing out the game for the Trojans.
At the plate USC banged out 12 hits, but it was the outs they made that pleased Hubbs the most. All season, the Trojans have hit into those same “nothing” outs, as in weak ground balls and pop ups that do nothing to challenge the defense or advance the runner. On Friday, they scored their first run with a leadoff double and a pair of groundouts. They scored their second with a single, a sacrifice bunt and another single. In fact, all five Trojan scorers advanced at least one base by way of a productive out.
Though the Trojans dropped the next two games, their performance Sunday is something they hope to build on. The team plays next on Tuesday at Loyola Marymount at 3 p.m. in the first of eight consecutive road games.

Entering a weekend doubleheader against junior college foes, the No. 4-ranked USC women’s sand volleyball team performed up to its coach’s expectations on Saturday in Santa Barbara, as the team swept both matches Santa Barbara City College and Fullerton College.
“We were using these matches in order to gain some experience on the beach for next week’s USA Volleyball Invitational at Hermosa Beach”, USC head coach Anna Collier said. “We weren’t expecting these matches to be too competitive, as long as we just focused on our side of the court.”
The Women of Troy (12-5) kicked off the day against SBCC, and started it on the right note at the No. 1 pairs spot, as junior Kirby Burnham and freshman Cinnamon Sary beat Jenna Anderson and Madi Waddell in straight sets, 21-8, 21-6.
This was a change in the Trojan’s lineup, because typically Burnham and Sary play at the No. 2 spot.
“We are trying some new things on the court and this pair of matches was a great time to put them to the test and see if what we are doing in practice is working on the court”, said Collier.
The pair of graduate student Stevi Robinson and senior Katie Fuller, who usually plays at the No.1 spot, took care of business in the No. 2 match, soundly defeating Rachel Bower and Jasmine Ward, 21-14, 21-9.
Another lop-sided match came at No. 5 spot, with freshmen Christine Irvin and Erica Muller defeating Kathleen Finnerty and Tessa Weller, 21-8, 21-6. The match victory was clinched in the No. 3 spot, where sophomores Eve Ettinger and Bria Russ beat Lara Bangs-Ari Garner, 21-15, 21-6.
The Women of Troy immediately followed their match against SBCC with a dual against Fullerton and the result was no different, as they went on to sweep them in every match.
Once again, Collier mixed and matched pairs, experimenting with different players at different courts.
Burnham and Sary defeated Shawnna Chung and Lisa Grislam at No. 1, 21-8, 21-11. Fuller and Robinson then then defeated the team of Jordyn Heebler and Crystal Lopez at No. 2, 21-17, 21-11.
Also, in their first action of the day, freshman Sydney Seau and sophomore Alexa Stonish knocked off the pair of Emilee Sorbom and Grace Rodriguez at No. 5, 21-12, 21-13.
In addition to the team scoring matches, USC swept all of the non-scoring exhibition matches as well, going 3-0 combined against both teams.
“These two matches are big, since we wanted to be able to carry some momentum going into next week’s tournament”, said Collier. “That’s when we won’t have the luxury of trying new things, and we won’t have such a large margin for error.
USC next plays in the USA Volleyball Beach Collegiate Challenge on April 20. The tournament showcases many of the top teams in the nation, including No. 1 Pepperdine and No. 2 Long Beach State. USC has lost to twice to each team this season and will be looking to break that streak.
The tournament will be held at Hermosa Beach, Calif., and the first serve is set for 9 a.m. on each day.

The USC women’s tennis team visited Eugene, Ore., on Sunday with one goal in mind: clinching the Pac-12 championship. With an impressive performance in singles play, the Women of Troy emerged with their Pac-12 record unblemished and a second consecutive conference championship secured.
In the only matchup this year between the Women of Troy (20-2, 9-0 Pac-12) and the Ducks, Oregon, ranked No. 64 entering the day, put up a fight in the early goings before being overwhelmed by the USC’s singles play.
USC head coach Richard Gallien was especially impressed with the performance, considering the travel constraints his players have gone through in a recent stretch of three straight away away matches following grueling tests at home against Cal and Stanford.
“I’m really proud of how well the girls are doing,” Gallien said. “They’re functioning at a high level while staying on top of all of their respective things.”
Using three new pairing in doubles play, the Women of Troy were only able to emerge victorious at the 3 spot, and thus gave the Ducks (12-10, 1-9 Pac-12) their first point of the day. USC picked up the pace in singles play however, led by sophomore Sabrina Santamaria, who won her 20th straight singles victory by beating Oregon’s Patricia Skowronski 6-0. Sophomore Zoe Scandalis, who was playing at the 1 spot for the Trojans, followed Santamaria’s lead with a 6-2, 6-3victory over Oregon’s Nicole Long.
On court six, freshman Ellie Yates was near perfect, winning her match 6-0, 6-1 over Rabea Stueckemann. Sophomore Gabriella DeSimone and junior Kaitlyn Christian sealed the win for USC, winning 6-1, 6-3 and 6-1, 6-4 respectively, and in the process secured a Pac-12 title for the second consecutive year. Moreover, the win against the Ducks gave the Women of Troy their second consecutive 20-win season and their third 20-win season in the last 5 years.
USC entered the matchup as the only team in the Pac-12 with an undefeated conference record. Sunday’s victory now sets up a pivotal conference showdown with rival UCLA on Thursday in the final regular season Pac-12 matchup for both teams. The game will be televised on the Pac-12 network and will also serve as the final home match at Marks Stadium this year.
