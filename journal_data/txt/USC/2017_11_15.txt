The 11th-ranked Trojans extended their winning streak to three games last week as they defeated Colorado
38-24 to clinch the Pac-12 South. USC took to the practice field Wednesday to continue preparing for its annual matchup with rival UCLA on Saturday.
Focus on the Bruins
Head coach Clay Helton identified three points of emphasis from Wednesday’s practice. First among them was third-down efficiency on both sides of the ball. Neither offense is particularly dangerous in these situations, as USC and UCLA rank 39th and 49th in the nation, respectively, in conversion percentage. The Trojans hold a defensive advantage, however, ranking 29th in conversion percentage allowed compared to the Bruins’ 70th.
“You’re talking about a high-powered offense with UCLA,” Helton said. “Being able to get off the field is going to be critical, along with limiting their opportunities by holding onto the ball offensively.”
The Trojans also focused on their special teams. USC ranks 70th in the country in special teams efficiency, while UCLA places 59th in that category. Trojan punt and kick returners have been plagued by muffs and fumbles this season, and that can’t be the case against UCLA’s offense.
“Being able to set the field position in our kick coverage units is going to be imperative to try to make a long field for a very talented offense,” Helton said.
Finally, Helton preached the importance of playing a clean game with as few mistakes as possible. The Trojans rank 116th in the country with 7.6 penalties per game this season, and it will be an ongoing struggle to fix mental mistakes on offense and defense. In addition, USC has 21 turnovers in 11 games on the season and has not made it through a contest without a giveaway this year.
“If all of a sudden you have a couple of turnovers in this game against this offense, they can put points up on you like that,” Helton said, snapping his fingers quickly to indicate the explosiveness of the Bruins’ offense.
Stopping ‘Chosen Rosen’
The Bruins’ offense is led by star junior quarterback Josh Rosen, a possible No. 1 draft pick in next year’s NFL draft. Rosen has thrown for 3,094 yards and 21 touchdowns this season on a 62.2 completion percentage and 8.1 yards per attempt. The signal-caller has had to carry a UCLA squad that ranks in the bottom 10 in the country in yards allowed per game. Rosen has made a name for himself digging his team out of holes to overcome big deficits, most notably his 34-point comeback win over Texas A&M in Week 1.
“He has no fear,” Helton said of Rosen. “He sees a window, he doesn’t hesitate [and] he pulls the trigger. He has the arm strength to get it there, and he’s deadly accurate.”
Injuries
Senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu returned to practice Wednesday after being held out Tuesday with a sprained ankle.
“We gave him about half the practice,” Helton said. “He moved around very well.”
Helton also mentioned that freshman running back Stephen Carr would most likely see an uptick in snaps this week.
“He’s looked good,” Helton said. “I think he’ll be able to contribute more. He’s looking very healthy this week, and explosive.”
Junior cornerback Iman Marshall is probable to play this week as he continues to recover from a sprained MCL that caused him to miss two games and limited his playing time against Colorado.
Helton also said that backup quarterback Matt Fink did not practice after suffering a knee sprain running into a teammate on Tuesday, but Helton expects Fink to suit up on Saturday.

After an uneven come-from-behind win Saturday afternoon against Eastern Washington, the No. 9 women’s soccer team (15-3-1) will travel to College Station, Tex., to face No. 23 Baylor (14-5-2) in the second round of the NCAA tournament on Friday afternoon.
The Women of Troy struggled against Big Sky champion Eastern Washington last week, taking two overtime periods to down the Eagles thanks to goals from junior forward Erika Okuma and redshirt senior forward Alex Anthony.
Despite the win, the Trojans were expected to handle their first-round opponents with ease — USC cruised past Eastern Washington 3-1 in the first round of last season’s NCAA tournament — and the team will have to regroup ahead of its matchup against Baylor and change its mentality at the start of the game.
“We got to flesh this one a little bit and go back to what we have been able to do for a large part of the season,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “We definitely have to be a lot more focused to start games, having our shot percentage be a lot better, and that will definitely be our focus [against Baylor].”
USC will continue to rely on leading scorer Anthony to come up with the goals. Her score against Eastern Washington raised her tally to 9 this season, and she looks to continue spearheading the Trojan offense. She only scored 1 postseason goal during last year’s championship run, but it was a game-winning effort against Auburn in the quarterfinals.
On the other side, Baylor comes off a 3-2 win over Rice in its first-round match. The game went back and forth, with both teams exchanging leads throughout the game. It was Rice that struck first in the 17th minute, but Baylor responded quickly.  2 goals in two minutes from senior defender Precious Akanyirige and senior midfielder Aline de Lima gave Baylor a 2-1 lead heading into halftime. A score by Rice in the 56th minute evened up the game once again, and it took until the 74th minute for Baylor to retake the lead. Sophomore forward Raegan Padgett netted the decisive goal, while junior forward Lauren Piercy provided the assist for all three Baylor goals.
This season, the Bears are offensively led by de Lima, who has 7 goals and seven assists this season, and Piercy, who has 4 goals and three assists (all of her contributions have come off the bench). For the year, the team is averaging 19 shots per game — almost seven on target — and has scored 32 goals in 21 games.
The Bears’ defense has also been impressive this season, only surrendering 13 goals and 8.8 shots per game. By comparison, USC’s defense has allowed 16 goals and 9.2 shots per game in 19 games this season.
Baylor’s road to the NCAA playoff was a long and often unlikely one.  Finishing fifth in the Big 12 regular season standings, the Bears were not expected to go far in the conference tournament.  However, Baylor found its form in the tournament, overcoming No. 18 Texas in the first round, No. 17 Oklahoma State in the second round and TCU in the final to win the Big 12 championship.  Baylor outscored its opponents 7-2 and outshot them 57-32 in the process. The Bears’ most impressive performance came against Oklahoma State — the Big 12 regular-season champions — when they outshot the Cowboys 23-5 and came away with a 3-0 win.
The Trojans will look to slow down the streaking Bears on Friday at 1:30 p.m. A win against Baylor would see the Trojans advance to the third round on Sunday, awaiting a matchup against the winner of No. 6 Texas A&M vs. Notre Dame.

After suffering an overtime loss to UCLA to end the regular season last week, the fourth-ranked men’s water polo team looks to rebound with a strong performance in this weekend’s MPSF Tournament. The Trojans (22-3), the No. 4 seed, will face Penn State Behrend at 10 a.m. Friday before playing tournament host Stanford at 3 p.m.
“When you lose a tough match, everybody gets a little more focused and works harder and thinks about the next game,” head coach Jovan Vavic said. “So I think [UCLA] will be a good loss.”
After reaching the NCAA championship match for the 12th consecutive year in 2016, USC entered this season ranked No. 2 and rose to the top spot after going 21-1 through the opening two months of the campaign. Following late-season losses to Cal and UCLA, USC has fallen to No. 4 but has a chance to reclaim its dominance this weekend. With two wins on Friday, the Trojans would play in the MPSF final on Sunday for an automatic bid into the NCAA Championships.
But the memory of two losses in one week remains fresh in the team’s mind.
“We are up-and-down,” Vavic said. “I think we’ve played some great games, and during the game itself we have a tendency to be excellent and then lose our focus. I think we’ve won some big games in the fourth quarter, and we’ve lost some.”
Vavic said the team played well offensively at last weekend’s game in Westwood, but allowed the Bruins to create too many scoring opportunities. This weekend, Vavic is looking for a stronger defensive performance.
“I think this game is usually decided in the cage and in the 2-meter area,” Vavic said. “So really, the key performers need to be your goalie, your center and your center defender. Usually if those positions are playing well, you win games.”
USC looks to set the tone in its first tilt against Penn State Behrend (6-12). The key match, however, comes in the afternoon, when the team takes on top-ranked Stanford (18-3) in the Cardinal’s pool. The Trojans edged Stanford in two regular-season meetings between the two sides, scraping by 8-6 in early September before winning 11-10 two weeks later. But both matches were in the friendly confines of the Uytengsu Aquatics Center — the Cardinal will hope their home pool provides the edge this weekend.
As USC enters the postseason, the MPSF Tournament is only the team’s first test on the road to the team’s ultimate goal: another NCAA title. Vavic said the group is ready to perform.
“We’re excited,” Vavic said. “It’s been a season of some great thrill and some frustration, and we’re looking forward to a great tournament.”

Julia Poe | Daily Trojan
The scene in Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday night looked like something out of a movie. Three college basketball players trudged off a plane and were immediately swarmed by an almost comedic band of photographers. With cameras flashing, the mob made it almost impossible for the young athletes to walk as they covered their eyes with their hands and tried to make their way out of the airport.
The three athletes — basketball players from UCLA — were most likely robbed, in that moment, of the relief they were hoping to feel upon returning to the United States. LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill had spent days under house arrest in China after shoplifting during a team trip for an exhibition game to Hangzhou. The trio was released only after a plea from President Donald Trump himself, a surprising move during the president’s trip to Asia.
Wednesday morning was the first time that the players addressed the issue. They sat at a table, with statements before them, and kept their heads bowed as they slowly stumbled over their prepared apologies. They were guilty. They were sorry. They were thankful for the chance to grow from the experience.
UCLA, in response, suspended them indefinitely.
I was shocked when I read this punishment. An indefinite suspension? There are coaches in the country who suspend players for that long when they’re caught breaking basic team rules. As time went on, I became more and more dumbfounded by the lackadaisical response to such an egregious error. 
Yes, LiAngelo Ball is part of the infamous Ball family headed by cantankerous egomaniac LaVar Ball, and his father’s response to the whole affair was as stupid as can be expected. But that’s not the real issue here. I could probably let loose a book’s worth (or three) about the idiocy of the way LaVar has preened over the talents of both himself and his children, but I’m not writing a column about parenting. Instead, what I want to look at is the dangerous way that we raise athletes as a society of sports fans.
These boys are only a few months out of high school. When they went abroad, they were representing both their team and their country, and they were tasked with doing this well. Instead, they broke the law and disgraced everyone whom they were representing. This isn’t a time for forgiveness; it’s a time for punishment.
Let’s make this clear — an indefinite suspension means that these players can come back at any time. It means that head coach Steve Alford is too concerned with these players’ skills to be willing to suspend them for a whole season. He had to keep everything on the table. And it also means that UCLA, in allowing these players to remain as students, is also valuing them more because of their skills on the court.
This happens all too often, and we’re aware of it to a certain extent. College athletes can rob convenience stores, punch out women in bars or beat their pregnant girlfriends until they are bloody and still earn places on NBA and NFL teams. These athletes are, in many ways, above the law.
So perhaps what smacks so wrong in this situation is the fact that this isn’t just American law that athletes are now considered to stand above. These three young men were released from China and allowed to return to America mainly based on their standing as high-profile athletes. And now, the process will begin again — apology statements followed by short suspensions followed by standout performances on the court that somehow erase those past transgressions from our memories.
This is a cycle that we must break. We can’t continue to allow young men to think that they are somehow above any law, including that of their own universities. If we have any hope of seeing young athletes become better human beings, fans and programs alike must begin to take more responsibility in the way they rebuke their stars.
There’s still time for this wrong to be righted. The UCLA administration could step in, or the NCAA could strong-arm the program into a longer suspension or a harsher punishment. But if this is allowed to stand as it is, we will not make any progress going forward.
Julia Poe is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism. She is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Poe’s Perspective,” runs Thursdays.
Good analysis Julia. Despite all the tweets they really are fortunate to not be sitting in a Chinese jail right now awaiting trial. The school undoubtedly will feel a lot of pressure from alumni, sponsors and media rights holders to let this blower over. If only The Wizard of Westwood was still here.
Yet another hysterical feminist screams that we should lynch male athletes even though women receive preferential treatment in every medium of law when it comes to punishment and sentencing.

David Friebe, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance, released his debut EP “Year In Review” under the stage name LAMI. Photo courtesy of David Friebe.
USC student David Friebe, better known by his stage name LAMI, has been forging a path into the music world at a fast pace. A sophomore majoring in popular music performance, Friebe recently released his debut EP “Year In Review,” featuring five tracks written and recorded by Friebe himself. 
Coming from a musical family with a father who is a professional jazz musician, Friebe was raised in a musical environment and had little choice as to whether music would be a big part of his life. Friebe dove into the music world at an early age and learned to play the drums at 3 years old. Though he did not take professional lessons, Friebe often found himself drawn to a variety of instruments laying around in his home. 
“We had instruments all over the house and music all around so everybody in my family was always picking up different instruments,” Friebe said.
Since then, he has learned nine instruments, but mainly focuses on the drums, piano, bass and guitar. 
Friebe also grew up performing with his father, who has  helped Friebe’s career  by getting him to be more serious about pursuing music. By middle school, Friebe began to understand what a career in music actually meant and immediately knew that was what he wanted to do, but he did not know how. Even when Friebe released his first album Out Of The Bubble during his senior year of high school, the idea of a career in music was simply a dream rather than a reality. 
Friebe taught himself how to record music using the popular software Logic to apply for New York University in his senior year. After picking up the basics of producing, Friebe soon recorded “Out of the Bubble,” a song that featured several friends for guest vocals and instruments. This was the first time he learned how to mix and master as well as professionally rap and write lyrics. The skills Friebe learned from this process helped him prepare for the production of “Year In Review.”
Once at USC, Friebe quickly began to make connections with those who later on helped him in many aspects of his career, from graphic designers for his artwork, to his current manager, Hector Garcia.  The Thornton program has also enabled Friebe to develop more as an artist.
“Being in [the popular music program] has allowed me to showcase the different talents I have and instruments I know, as well as find out exactly what I want to do and focus on,” Friebe said.
It was not until Friebe matriculated at USC that he realized his dream could become a reality. Friebe has been able to play and work with countless other USC students, while building up a team that covers every aspect of his musical career, like legalities and promotion. 
Friebe began writing and recording for “Year In Review” last summer and remained in control throughout the entire process. Friebe wrote, produced and recorded all of the vocals on “Year In Review,” but also brought in fellow USC students and friends for background vocals and instruments. The team handles social media, promotion strategy and photo and video.
Friebe also recently released a music video for his song “Silhouette” with the help of fellow USC students. While Friebe had always wanted to make music videos for previous songs, as soon as he began writing the beat for “Silhouette,” he knew he had to make a music video. 
”As soon as I made the beat, I knew I wanted there to be dancers and for the song to be dance-oriented,” Friebe said. “I made the beat and got the hook in my head and I knew this was the song.”
 After finishing up a demo for “Silhouette,” Friebe proposed his idea for the music video to Garcia as well as his friend Matthew Carieri, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, who directed the video. Friebe said he was able to execute every detail he had envisioned for the music video with the help of his team.
Plans and rehearsals for the video began in mid-summer and the actual filming took place during the first two weeks of school. For the party scene, Friebe and his team actually threw a party and filmed clips throughout the night, which was followed up the next day with filming at a warehouse with a formal production team. The low-budget video was possible through a lot of fundraising as well as friends looking to get experience rather than pay. 
As 2017 comes to a close, Friebe hopes to put out one or two more EPs in 2018 while also continuing to perform and expand his fan base. Friebe also hopes to continue to foster his current relationships and make even more connections to further his career while enjoying his time at USC.

Charlotte Spangler (left) who graduated from USC in 2014, and Sahil Kaur (right) who graduated in 2016, are both part of Elysium Conservatory Theatre’s production of Three Sisters. Photos courtesy of Charlotte Spangler and IMDb.
From the stage of the Bing Theatre, two USC alumni, Charlotte Spangler and Sahil Kaur, found themselves at the Elysium Conservatory Theatre. Spangler, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree  in theatre in 2014, and Kaur, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree  in communication in 2016, had never met until 2017,  when Kaur joined the conservatory and took one of Spangler’s improv classes. 
This winter, the alumni will cross paths in the production of Three Sisters, where Spangler will portray the lead character Olga and Kaur will serve as her understudy. 
The Elysium Conservatory, located in San Pedro, Calif., is a multidisciplinary organization that opened in 2011. Its unique venue has no set stage or audience seating area, allowing audience members to become part of the theatrical experience.
“Interacting with the audience in this way is why I love theater — it’s always different every night and you have to work off what is in front of you,” Spangler said. “Depending on where the audience sits, or how they react, you have to improvise to keep moving the story forward.”
The road to performing with Elysium was winding for both Kaur and Spangler. Spangler joined the conservatory after experiencing problems with auditions in Los Angeles. 
“So many projects I see or audition for in L.A. are just not something I really want to be a part of,” Sprangler said. “The roles are sexist or poorly written or just don’t tell a story that I want to tell.”
Kaur transferred to USC as a sophomore majoring in biological sciences before deciding to fully pursue filmmaking and acting her junior year. She returned to theater this past summer when she auditioned for the conservatory’s production.  
“I had a pretty toxic relationship with theater in high school and I wanted to overcome adolescent fears and anxieties and just get back into it for the love of doing it,” Kaur said. “When I got an audition for the program, I told myself to just have fun with it and see what happens.”
Since joining the conservatory, Spangler has played the Nurse in Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.She and Kaur both worked on Dark of the Moon over the summer. 
“Being the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet was sort of a dream role that I had a blast playing, and it let me explore more of the dramatic side,” Spangler said. “But over the summer, working on Dark of the Moon, I got to play an Appalachian mom with a strong [accent] and a passion for drinking corn liquor, which was just super fun.”
Now the two are both working on the theater’s upcoming show, Three Sisters, Spangler as the character Olga and Kaur as her understudy. 
Three Sisters  tells the story about how three sisters bring their slow, small Russian town together, told over the course of five years. The story was written by Anton Chekhov at the turn of the 20th century and is a classical Russian play that the Elysium Conservatory contemporized to incorporate new music and movement pieces. The rendition features new and diverse female roles, following the emotional and physical growth of the sisters over the course of the story. 
“I definitely found that the existential queries our characters grapple with in this place, in this span of five years, is comparable to the worries we find in our lives at this moment,” Kaur said. 
Three Sisters will be shown in two parts, one night with Acts 1 and 2 and another with Acts 3 and 4. The Elysium cast will bring the sisters’ story to life from Nov. 18 to Dec. 16. 
“It’s a really honest, truthful piece of theater that doesn’t hide from the raw emotions of the human experience,” Sprangler said.

I am often asked how I can be a feminist and still love hip-hop, a question that admittedly provokes a sigh and several eye rolls. I am reminded that in 2000, Eminem wrote more than a few bars illustrating domestic violence throughout The Marshall Mathers LP and in 2013, Rick Ross came under fire for rapping about date rape in his song “U.O.E.N.O.”  
While I am not condoning, nor will I ever condone, misogyny or sexual assault, critics of hip-hop often fail to recognize the prevalence of misogynistic lyrics in every single genre.  Country music lyrics frequently objectify women, who, as female subjects, remain mostly anonymous and are discussed as sexual prospects on a whiskey-filled summer night.  
Pop music is notorious for creating a divide between “the good girl” and “the naughty girl,” and live performances have been curated for the male gaze. Even the classical music world is rampant with sexism, as male composers have expressed their reluctance to promote female conductors, explaining that they might be a sexual distraction to the orchestra. Clearly, misogyny is still a widespread problem in almost every field.  
The very nature of hip-hop and rap is raw.  What might be easier to hide under the sound of a twangy guitar or an overproduced synth is more audible in rap.  The stripped-down melodies and explicit language can expose certain ugly truths in our society, but can also be used to propel and clearly express progressive ideas as well.  This perceived weakness of hip-hop is actually one of its distinct strengths. 
Hip-hop artist Lil’ Kim’s debut studio album, Hard Core, was released in 1996 and is one of the first rap albums to talk about female lust. Photo from Atlantic Records.
The pioneer women of hip-hop, like Salt-N-Pepa and MC Lyte, broke down barriers and shattered stereotypes regarding female sexuality from the mid-1980s onward, paving the way for more legends like Missy Elliot, Queen Latifah and, of course, Lil’ Kim to emerge.  
This Sunday marked the 21st anniversary of Lil’ Kim’s debut studio album, Hard Core.  Although November 1996 was a starkly different time than the November we are living in now, the themes of Hard Core are more relevant than ever. Kimberley Jones, who was only a teenager when she joined Junior M.A.F.I.A., wanted her music to reflect her raunchy, Brooklyn-bred attitude and unwavering confidence.  
Even Hard Core’s album art showcases Lil Kim’s sexual prowess, with her posed on all fours on top of a bear skin rug, legs spread apart and eyes directed at the camera. The record begins with a provocative skit that fades perfectly into one of Kim’s most famous tracks, “Big Momma Thang.” The entire album strikes a balance between the smooth samples of ’70s funk and Lil’ Kim’s vulgar rhymes. However, her vulgarity is not without purpose — Lil’ Kim was one of the first rappers to talk about female lust. On “Dreams,” Kim reveals which R&B singers she lusts after and objectifies men for a change. On songs like “Crush On You,” “Queen B@#$H” and “Not Tonight,” Lil’ Kim empowers all women to demand more from their lovers and sexual partners, arguing that sex should be about pleasing both parties. 
In a world where freely expressing female sexuality comes with layers of judgment and assumptions, Lil’ Kim’s Hard Core revolutionized hip-hop. As sexual assault continues to rise to the forefront of the global discussion, it is more important than ever to reclaim power over our bodies, and unapologetically embrace both our masculinity and femininity regardless of gender.

Summary: Men expressing their sexuality? OMG SEXUAL HARASSMENT, GIMME MONEY. Women expressing their sexuality? “You go grrrrrl.”
Summary: in a male dominated genre females freely expressing their sexuality and creating a space for themselves is groundbreaking and refreshing
Summary: objectifying men is OK, objectifying women is misogyny. Women demanding sexual acts from men is liberating, but men demanding sex from women is evil patriarchal male gaze. *rolls eyes*

There’s something both empowering and disturbing about the hordes of women and men coming forward to tell their stories of sexual abuse. Disturbing, because what other word could be used to describe cases of rape, sexual harassment and assault being buried and overlooked for years? And empowering, because these revelations are the direct product of women working together to create spaces for other women and survivors to feel safe opening up about their traumas — if they so choose — and help bring perpetrators to justice. 
But anyway, back to disturbing. Last week, a bombshell report by the The Washington Post about Alabama Judge Roy Moore, the Republican Party’s Senate candidate in a special election slated to take place on Dec. 12, alleged that Moore had inappropriate relationships with minors and teenage girls while he was in his 30s. Some women have accused Moore of child molestation and asserting his power and credibility as a district attorney to silence them. 
Locals and Moore’s former co-workers corroborate these allegations, recounting how many in Moore’s community thought it was odd that he “dated” high school students, frequented high school football games and was even banned from a local mall for harassing teenage girls. Imagine living in a country where a man banned from a mall for predatory behavior could be welcomed into the capital’s esteemed lawmaking chambers.
At any rate, as is typically the case when shocking allegations are made about high-profile male figures, a disproportionate amount of effort is being spent not on holding Moore accountable, but on doling out misogynistic lines of attack to cast doubt on his female accusers. This is the typical rhythm of stories of this nature — projecting sexist ideas of the perfect female victim, the perfect timeline of abuse, to discredit and punish women who don’t meet these arbitrary standards. And yet, here is where the circumstances in Moore’s story diverge from those of other famous male predators: His victims were children when he allegedly abused them. His victims were children, while Moore was and is a grown, adult male — and yet he is the one his supporters are determined to absolve of responsibility. 
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
This particular reality may be difficult to absorb, and yet there’s a reason that it’s so familiar. That is, women never really get to be children — or, at least, not in the way that men do. Rather, we’ve always been forced to grow up more quickly than our male counterparts, an infuriating reality that’s all but confirmed by the inability of Moore’s defenders — who range from Fox News’ resident conspiracy theorist Sean Hannity, to the Bible story-telling Alabama state auditor, Jim Zeigler — to acknowledge that the women accusing Moore were children when he allegedly took advantage of them.
And beyond that, young women don’t get to enjoy the privilege of their mistakes or inappropriate behaviors being laughed off with a dismissive, “girls will be girls” — we’re taught the consequences of our actions, whereas young men aren’t. Survivors know what they might face in coming forward to talk about sexual assault and abuse — disbelief, character attacks, perhaps even being forced to relive their trauma. And so, when it comes to cases of sexual assault and violence, it’s no surprise that 67 percent of survivors don’t come forward or report to the police. 
Perhaps this is the foundation of abuse of power among influential men: The idea that what they say and do don’t have consequences, because the subjects of their abuse lack the power to challenge them. One of Moore’s accusers said that he nearly choked her while trying to force her to orally gratify him, and later said the words, “You are a child. I am the district attorney of Etowah County.”
The Post’s report would be a lot to take in had its subject been anyone other than Moore, but Moore’s identity as a fervently devout, holier-than-thou Christian — one who has equated abortion to murder, who has called for homosexual acts to be criminalized and for Muslims to be banned from the Senate — is what makes the report the once-in-a-generation spectacle that it is.
And yet, my point here is not that Moore’s hypocrisy is particularly surprising. Aggressively intolerant Republicans hiding skeletons in the closet aren’t rare — notably, this year, a report alleged that while promoting the March for Life, an anti-choice Congressman tried to coerce his mistress into having an abortion. Hypocrisy and intense contradiction between public and private morality are so commonplace among far-right politicians that in Moore’s case, it arguably isn’t even the story. 
Yes, there are criticisms that must be made of a fringe-right that produces and enables the likes of Moore and his loyalists. For all the “pro-life” movement’s banter about protecting and nurturing children (all, of course, while defunding the Children’s Health Insurance Program last month), those at its helm are the ones who have seized on allegations against Moore to try and re-litigate the age of consent, to implicitly give child abusers the “OK” by advocating on Moore’s behalf. 
Still, the issue at hand is bigger, even, than that. As women, we’re made to exist in a society in which we’re either infantilized or dealt full blame and responsibility at the convenience of men like Moore. Women are regarded as children when it comes to making basic decisions about our bodies and reproductive health, and we’re adults when it comes to absolving men of responsibility for their actions. Moore and his supporters are the products of a political climate in which women are allowed to be only one of two extremes.

Is it just me, or does anyone else notice the sheer lack of women accused of misconduct while feminist harpies keep screaming about how men are evil? In the real world, domestic violence is as likely to be perpetrated by women as men and women are as likely to engage in sexual coercion against men as vice versa. Sadly, PC culture makes it impossible to hold women accountable.

It took her three tries to get admitted to USC.
She applied after high school. And again, as a sophomore in community college. Both times — rejected.

Every ‘no’ pushed Roxanna Barboza closer to living her life in Lost Hills, a rural town in California, where she says the majority of people her age either work in the fields or in the oil industry. Her parents had not been able to go to college. She had nothing to rely on but her education.
For children in her rural community, college did not seem like much of an option — so she created the “Colleges Out There” program for students like her to reach a college education. 
Now, Barboza is studying to receive her master’s degree in public policy at USC, a school she only thought was possible to reach in her prayers.
“Having three younger siblings looking up to me, I realized that the best goal at that moment was for me to strive to go to university,” Barboza said.

Barboza is one of the nearly 3,000 first-generation students at USC. While many of these students share similar struggles — being the first in their family to go to college — their needs differ as their identities intersect, according to Mary Ho, the assistant dean of diversity and strategic initiatives for the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
“It can be overwhelming to try to navigate the university system for first-gen [students] because this is very new to them,” Ho said. “They don’t have the foundational knowledge to know what it means to be a student at a university.”
Roughly 17 percent of this year’s incoming freshmen were the first in their families to attend college, a five-percentage-point increase from 2010, according to USC statistics.
While the number of admittances of students from this population has seen growth, for Tiaira Mohammed, president of the First Generation Student Union, not enough is being done to address the issues of these students.
“I knew coming into USC that it was definitely going to be a culture shock,” Mohammed said. “I’m from Inglewood, which is a predominantly black community. I realized my high school experience definitely didn’t prepare me enough like other students.”

Her experience, she said, resonates with many of the other students who come from low-income backgrounds like her own. That’s why she and several other students started FGSU last year.
Dozens of students attend club meetings where Mohammed helps lead workshops, socials and community-related events. The FGSU is student-led and is “founded in the hopes that first-gen students would be able to find each other and raise the visibility of that population,” said Trista Beard, the group’s adviser.
“FGSU is a way to make a sort of unofficial first-gen student services,” Beard said. “But it’s students helping students and providing workshops and spaces to network. It’s not an official University entity.”
Both Mohammed and Beard wish the University would create a resource center, similar to the cultural centers already offered at USC, where first-generation students can directly receive the resources they need to succeed.

Currently, low-income and first-generation students have access to resources like the virtual food pantry, where students who may have an unstable economic situation can receive help to pay for basic expenses, Ho said. 
Students are allowed to receive up to three $25 gift cards to Trader Joe’s per semester in order to help cover food expenses, Ho said. In addition, pantries with snacks and food are available at the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund office in the Student Union and at the Office of Diversity and Strategic Initiatives in the Von KleinSmid Center.
There, students can grab snacks and non-perishable items if they are food insecure. 
Along with the food pantry, which may help in the day-to-day college survival, first-generation students can also apply to fellowship programs like the Fisher, Mellon Mays and Research Gateway Fellowships, which push their college careers past the undergraduate level.
Fisher Fellows receive financial support to attend Maymester and Problems Without Passports programs along with a retreat at Catalina Island. They also take part in mentorship and leadership seminars hosted by faculty and alumni.
Gateway Fellows are offered research opportunities that “aim to diversify the student bodies at the graduate-level and the professoriate ranks,” according to the program’s website. The program offers academic tutoring and counseling, as well as seminars to help scholars take part in graduate-level work.
Similarly, the Mellon Mays program is made for the advancement of students of color in higher education and is specific to students who want to become professors and may want to attain a doctorate degree, according to the program’s website. Students receive stipends each semester and are given the opportunity to do research while at USC.

Natalie Solis, a senior majoring in religion, is both a Gateway Fellow and a Mellon Mays Fellow. She transferred from Barnard College in New York City to take advantage of these opportunities, which enabled her to work on three independent research projects.
Her most recent research project delved into how murals of the Virgin of Guadalupe help create sacred spaces for the Latino community in Boyle Heights.
“I wouldn’t be applying for graduate school if it weren’t for those programs,” Solis said. “Increasing diversity within higher education is done by supporting students of color while they’re undergraduates.”
While these resources are available, accessing them and finding them can be tough for students new to USC, Ho said.
“[First-gen students] don’t know what they don’t know, but if we’re able to centralize information and resources, and also educate our faculty and staff about what’s available, then they can share that with a student they’re meeting with [and help guide them through that process],” Ho said.
Mohammed said she wants FGSU to emulate what is currently done with the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, a scholarship and retention program that helps nearly 200 low-income, first-generation students. 
With NTSAF, not only do students receive economic help with their yearly and study abroad expenses, but they also have access to an office where students can come in and take advantage of the open-door policy offered by program directors Beard and Christina Yokoyama.
“If we could be bridges to campus resources, scholarship offices, financial aid, multicultural resources, that’s the best work we can do,” Beard said. “It’s to open the door comfortably and get the student the ‘warm hand-off.’”
Topping Scholars, as recipients of the NTSAF are called, are invited to a retreat before the school year begins where these students can meet each other and learn about the resources available to them. 
Throughout the year, Topping Scholars are invited to mentorship programs and events to aid them throughout the college process.
That’s where, for Mohammed, the Topping Scholars become a family.
“These are people that are genuine family to me,” Mohammed said. “And that’s what First Generation Student Union is trying to create as well.”

The Student Affairs division of Undergraduate Student Government is currently polishing a new wellness course for first-year undergraduate students that could begin as soon as fall 2018. Marina Hrovat, Director of Wellness Affairs, has been one of the instrumental forces behind this program.
“This initiative really started in response to the lack of training that we have specifically in the realms of sexual assault, bystander intervention, active shooter [training]. alcohol and substance abuse,” Hrovat said.
According to Hrovat, the course would focus on socially relevant topics like sexual health, spirituality and mindfulness, sustainability and others.
“A couple of things that we looked more intensely at was the role of mental health, the importance of self-care, nutrition, personal finance, diversity and identity, cultural competency, and there are plenty more topics that will be covered in the course,” Hrovat said.
Hrovat said the course would help incoming students become better acquainted with on-campus resources.
“One of the big gaps that we noticed is that students don’t know what the resources are on this campus, and it would be really beneficial to plug these resources in with first-year students,” Hrovat said.
The course will likely be a pass/no pass course and will ideally be taught by administrators, according to Hrovat.
“We are looking at having administrators from key offices teach the course,” Hrovat said. “For example, using Gretchen Means from the Title IX office.”
According to Hrovat, the initiative already has great administrative support and is into the late stages of its crafting.
“As of right now, we do have 14 weeks of curriculum around various topics,” Hrovat said. “We are actually looking at doing a pilot run of the program next fall with about 500 students.”
Though the course would primarily be taken by freshmen, it will be mandatory for all incoming undergraduate students, including transfers. However, Hrovat does not plan on making the course mandatory right away. Instead, it will initially be offered as an optional course.
“In terms of the pilot run that we’re going to take in the fall [of 2018] and then likely again in the spring [of 2019] before it’s fully implemented, it will be volunteer based and then a mandated course,” Hrovat said.
Ultimately, Hrovat hopes the course will create a campus environment of enhanced social awareness and active behaviors in improving the campus environment in all its aspects.
“We want the classroom time to be spent having a dynamic and didactic conversation about these topics,” Hrovat said.

Panelists discuss the issue of homegrown terrorism at the “Global Solutions in the Age of Homegrown Violent Extremism” summit. Photo courtesy of Tom Queally.
On Tuesday, the Price School of Public Policy’s Safe Communities Institute hosted a summit titled “Global Solutions in the Age of Homegrown Violent Extremism,” which featured experts in counter-terrorism, policymakers, law enforcement officials and former extremists to discuss potential solutions to domestic terrorism. 
The summit seeks to address homegrown violent acts committed by extremists who are inspired by a diverse collection of ideological motivations, based on race, religion and other issues.
The discussions explored better detections and deterrents for  radicalization and extremism recruitment. The summit featured speakers like former Islamic extremist Mubin Shaikh and USC Price Homegrown Violent Extremism Studies Program Director Erroll Southers, who spoke to the Daily Trojan on the importance of the summit and homegrown violent extremism. He offered his outlooks on mitigating homegrown violent extremists within the L.A. community. 
Southers thinks there is a need for the public to acknowledge both white supremacists and foreign jihadists as extremists. 
“RAM — Rise Above Movement is a white supremacist extremist movement that is located here in Southern California,” Southers said. “They are out there and they are literally homegrown.”
Southers noted that many students and even Los Angeles law enforcement officers were unaware of these agitations, which he classified as extremism.
The summit was held to mitigate the lack of awareness in the L.A. community beyond educating students, he said. 
Southers identified the Trump administration as the main trigger of today’s upsurge in homegrown violence.
“We did not have this happen a year ago; we did not have this two years ago,” Southers said. “People are emboldened now. The rise of hate crime has gone up since January. There is no coincidence here. There is a certain dynamic that is going on … [extremists] across the country feel they can now come out.” 
Southers emphasized the importance of acknowledging the problem and having leadership that expresses unity. As a professor at USC, Southers believes increased campus awareness can build a discourse around homegrown violent extremism.
“[With my students], I challenge them to investigate what happened in homegrown terrorism or international terrorism,” Southers said. “We never had a class where we could not find anything … so it really is just a matter of reading and being more educated on the subject.” 
Shaikh, who is now an expert on counterterrorism and a former Canadian intelligence member, spoke as a panelist about the dangers of radicalization and terrorist recruitment. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Shaikh said there is never only one sign of indoctrination in a homegrown terrorist; rather, there are a cluster of behaviors the public should learn to recognize. 
“The closer to dehumanization, the more extreme the groups are,” Shaikh said. “For example, [there is] very rigid black and white thinking: seeing the world in absolutes.” 
As a Muslim born and raised in Canada, Shaikh grew up within two conflicting and competing cultures. During his two-year stay in Syria, Shaikh fully embraced jihadist culture and was inspired by hate crimes. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Shaikh evolved into a champion of deradicalization and began to recognize signs of indoctrination. 
“Signs could include negative peer influences, conflicts with family over identity crisis and religion and isolation,” Shaikh said. 
He suggested that students be aware and identify potentially vulnerable people, especially younger individuals, who are at risk of potentially being indoctrinated. 
Shaikh also gave advice to Muslim students reconciling their identity and faith.
“You need to be out there,” Shaikh said to the Muslim community. “Getting involved with interfaith activities is very important — as people of faith to reach out [to] other people of faith.” 
According to Shaikh, it is impossible to predict violence, but by increasing the local community’s awareness of extremism, he believes violence can be preventable. 
To combat extremism, Shaikh advocated for acceptance and love, instead of retaliating with further hate crimes. 
“[It] is all about strength in numbers,” Shaikh said. “[Extremists] just need to see that they are outnumbered by regular decent people … It is time for us to show force.” 
Persistence and strength in numbers changed Shaikh’s life, and he likewise hopes they will alter extremist thinking. 
“At the time I remember people trying to tell me things, and they did not really activate in my life until much later,” Shaikh said. “So don’t give up on people.”
Southers also echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the importance of protecting marginalized student groups, especially the Muslim population, from being associated with extremism.
“I think we have to live the USC creed of inclusion, of tolerance, of respect and dignity,” Southers said. “If we live out those values, we will protect each other.” 
Yet, Southers offered a positive outlook on the future of decreasing the rates of homegrown violence. 
“I have a really good outlook on this situation, because I believe the people who are here today are part of the solution,” Southers said. “This is not a government response; we need to fix this, and I think we can.” 
 
“In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Shaikh said there is never only one sign of indoctrination in a homegrown terrorist…”
Words have meaning and when people in authority purposely (or otherwise) use them in ways that insinuate things that are not true we create false memes and/or propaganda. 
Every single one of these white mass murders were not associated with any organization unlike the hundreds of Muslim terrorist attacks committed in the name of “Allahu Akbar”.  
Visit the website “The Religion of Peace”.  Click on the tab for “Terrorist Attacks”.  By doing so you will find chronicled terrorist attacks committed by Muslims and in the name of Allah.  You will find thousands of attacks committed across the globe and since 9/11.  Comparing these lone wolf white psychopaths to true terrorists is disingenuous and/or sloppy thinking.
“Southers thinks there is a need for the public to acknowledge both white supremacists and foreign jihadists as extremists.”
Of course this ignores the 800 lb elephant in the room.  White men who go on killing sprees pledge no allegiance to anything other than their own uncontrollable psychosis, whereas throughout Islam’s history violent jihad has gone hand-in-hand.
This is another example of sloppy thinking, false analogies and why this issue is so muddied by American academicians.

USC Helenes, the University’s oldest female service organization, have been on a 24-hour watch to guard the Hecuba statue at USC Village in honor of Troy Week, the week of the USC-UCLA football game. 
The Helenes have been gathered around the 12-foot statue since Saturday evening, and will continue to do so until the UCLA football game. Members are encouraged to eat, study and take turns sleeping next to Hecuba in order to guard against potential UCLA pranksters. There are always at least four members present during the day and two members alert and on guard at night, according to Helenes President Kylie Sedgwick.
“Watching over Hecuba has been really fun,” said Ellie Lo Re, a freshman Helenes member majoring in neuroscience. “All these restaurants in the Village have been donating food to us and it has given me a lot of time to hang out with the other Helenes in the organization, who I haven’t really met yet.” 
Revealed in August at the USC Village’s opening, Hecuba, Queen of Troy, aims to symbolize the women of Troy and the diversity of the Trojan Family. The statue serves as a counterpart to Tommy Trojan located in Hahn Plaza, and its’ 8-foot base depicts six women of African, Asian, Caucasian, Latinx, Native American and Eastern Mediterranean descent.
“It’s an especially high honor for us because Hecuba is a symbol of strong, diverse women, and we just really identify with her and the values that she had,” Sedgwick said. “We really connect with the fact that she urges Trojans to fight on even when the odds seem against them.”
This is the first time the Helenes have participated in “Hecuba Watch.” However, the Helenes’ brother organization, the Trojan Knights, have been honoring a similar tradition by guarding Tommy Trojan during Troy Week since the early 1940s, according to Trojan Knights President David Monk.
“Various acts of vandalism went back and forth between the two campuses, and sometime around the early ‘80s, these acts escalated rapidly,” Monk said. “Now we stand guard to make sure that Tommy doesn’t fall victim to any attacks from the other school … [and] spending a week dedicated to protecting Tommy has also given us a week to dedicate sharing brotherhood.”
Sedgwick hopes Hecuba Watch will become a longstanding tradition during Troy Week.
“I think the rivalry is really … a unique thing about being at USC,” Sedgwick said. “[It’s] that you have another institution across town, but I think there’s a lot of community sort of around that. It’s something that brings people together.”
In addition to protecting Hecuba, the Helenes are also conducting a week-long hygiene donation drive at the statue. The USC community is encouraged to donate toothbrushes, feminine hygiene products, clothing and blankets to be distributed to the local homeless population.
“We’re collecting different items,” Katie Bradley said, a senior Helenes member majoring in policy, planning and development. “They range from toothbrushes to female hygiene products, and we’re going to take all of those and take them to The Hippie Kitchen and USC Share a Meal so they can hand them out to homeless shelters around campus.”

Alumnus Andrew Park, who operates the Chik-fil-A on Figueroa Street, hopes to further integrate the restaurant into campus life. Photo by Isabel Hanewicz | Daily Trojan
For USC alumnus Andrew Park, a chicken sandwich has the potential to change lives. 
When Park first started working for Chick-fil-A about two and a half years ago, he knew he had a passion for business and social impact, but did not yet have a grasp of the restaurant in a larger context. 
Now the operator of the Chick-fil-A located on Figueroa Street, Park hopes to use his role to give back to the University community.
“I think to have the opportunity to come back and serve the University, serve the community — not just the students but all the faculty and everybody that is part of that [experience] — to come inside and serve them has been fantastic,” Park said.
In 2012, Park received a bachelor’s degree from the Marshall School of Business with an emphasis on entrepreneurship. After running his own start-up during and after his undergraduate career, he ended up assisting in running a new Chick-fil-A in Orange County before moving to work for its corporate branch. On Nov. 1, he took over as operator of the Chick-fil-A near USC.
“To be back with the Trojan Family, that I was beyond excited about,” Park said.
In the future, Park hopes to increase the company’s social presence in South Los Angeles. Originally based in Georgia, Chick-Fil-A is currently expanding its reach in California.
“Chick-Fil-A is passionate about each restaurant being locally owned and locally operated, so I’ve been thinking into some of the things I’d like to pour into,” Park said. “Some of the things we’re looking into start connecting other organizations about is anything with youth and the inner city.”
Looking toward the future, Park hopes that the local Chick-fil-A will become more integrated into campus life.
“What I’d like to see and have students experience here is really a sense of community,” Park said. “[So] that when people visit, [they think], ‘Man, Chick-fil-A is an integral part of the USC student experience.’”
Chick-fil-A already sponsors a few initiatives to connect with USC. The restaurant offers free sandwiches when USC’s football team blocks a kick and hosts Trojan Tuesdays, where students receive special discounts on Tuesday nights. In the future, the restaurant hopes to increase its digital reach to continue improving the experience for students, said Eric Kim, the restaurant’s new director of technology.
“I think one thing we’re putting a lot of emphasis on [is] different platforms that can get our product into students’ hands without them even having to visit the store,” said Kim, who is also a USC alumnus. “We have the Chick-fil-A One App, Tapingo and Door Dash. “We understand that the line can be out the door sometimes, so whatever we can do to get people their Chick-fil-A.”
As members of the Trojan Family, both Park and Kim emphasize their commitment to being a resource for students, whether they’re looking to understand more about the restaurant, searching for an internship opportunity or hoping to learn about the world of business.
“[We’re] just here to be a resource for university students,” Park said. “And…just [to] give back because USC had done a lot to set me up and I feel like there’s a lot I can share about my journey with students.”
