A handful of former and current Undergraduate Student Government leaders proposed a bylaw amendment to a diversity fund during a contentious, three-hour Senate meeting Tuesday night.
Sen. Michaela Murphy and former USG leader Mai Mizuno presented a bylaw amendment alongside senators Manda Bwerevu and Meagan Lane. The four aimed to improve transparency and accessibility to a fund dedicated to campus diversity initiatives. 
The fund was created in 2015 after pressure from various USC cultural organizations, which clamored for more funding. The fund would offer a $100,000 budget split evenly between the USG and the Graduate Student Government, and its initial goal was “to provide a new avenue for their voices to be heard” and “to support student programs and events that enhance our university’s understanding of access, opportunity, diversity, and inclusion,” according to a 2015 memo from the Provost regarding the initiative.
While the fund was a short-term victory in the eyes of some students when it was instituted in 2015, Murphy emphasized that numerous diversity- and advocacy-based initiatives had been stalled due to lack of access to and availability of the fund.
Some of the proposed initiatives that failed included a career fair for undocumented students and diversity training for staff and the Department of Public Safety. These incidents reflect the problems of the fund’s current state, some senators said.
The bylaw amendment originally proposed three main changes. The amendment would work to renew the $50,000 fund each year, establish an oversight board, and create a transparent process to for students to access the fund.
The oversight board would feature a chief diversity office, a treasurer and a representative from each cultural assembly.
The senators in support of the amendment were concerned that students were unfamiliar with how the fund can be used and decided to propose changes to those concerns. 
“There’s hesitation for the renewal of the fund, but that is a testament to a lack of awareness, as opposed to lack of demand,” Murphy said during the meeting.
Representatives from the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, the Black Student Assembly and the Environmental Student Assembly spoke in support of the amendment during an open forum.
“There’s not always ways for people that want to dedicate themselves to advocacy for diversity to fight for what they want,” said Nia Warren, the co-director of BSA. “There are a lot of opportunities to take on advocacy, so if USG really values diversity, we also need funding.” 
During the presentation, Sen. Jillian Halperin expressed concerns about how the $50,000 fund might not be sufficient to address the needs of students
“Are we fixing a problem? Or are we setting it up in another way?” Halperin asked during the meeting.
The floor became contentious when Speaker Pro Tempore Matt Crane proposed a motion to form a special committee dedicated to exploring and tweaking the amendment before a vote passed.
This motion would create a committee that would include the Executive Board, the authors of the bylaw, directors and co-directors of organizations and senators were interested in contributing.
USG Vice President Blake Ackerman told the Daily Trojan that the committee’s purpose would be to ensure  an “organic space for discussion” among those involved with the amendment and USG’s executive leadership.
However, leaders in favor of the amendment said that they felt silenced during the Senate meeting rather than being given an opportunity to discuss on the floor.
“We were told to sit down,” Murphy said, expressing her concern with the way Crane and Ackerman handled the conversation during the meeting. 
In the end, the motion to create a special committee to oversee the amendment discussions failed to pass on a 7-5 decision and a motion was unanimously passed to table further discussion regarding the amendment until Sept. 18. 
“A lack of communication among USG showed that there was a clear disconnect,” Ackerman said. “Although the Senate is rigidly structured, this was an opportunity for there to be some open communication. My hope is that people who had feelings expressed them the way they wanted to, and I think that this is another step to hear all opinions openly.”

Maleka Haghighi, a student at USC Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry, uses dentistry to connect with others. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
For the 35 incoming members of the Advanced Standing Program for International Dentists class of 2020 proceeding through their White Coat Ceremony on Friday, the ceremony was symbolic of beginning a career in dentistry in the United States. 
Despite growing up in an oppressive environment and being raised by a single mother in Tehran, Iran, Melika Haghighi is entering as a new student at the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC.
ASPID is a two-year long program for dentists trained in other countries to receive their Doctor of Dental Surgery degree, which is required to practice in the United States. Haghighi is one of the 35 members of the incoming class of students hailing from nine different countries, ranging from Ukraine to South Korea.
Haghighi was elected by her peers as the class president of ASPID student body for Ostrow’s Associated Student Body and will be serving alongside Vice President Nirav Patel. Both will represent the student body and communicate between the class and Ostrow faculty. As the class president, Haghighi envisions a positive future of the class by promoting teamwork.
“In just the few months that our ASPID Class of 2020 has been studying at Ostrow, Melika has emerged as a natural leader,” Dean of Ostrow Avishai Sadan wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “There’s no doubt in my mind that the adversity she has experienced in her past has helped forge her into the strong, determined young woman we see today.”
Haghighi explained how growing up in a divorced family caused those in her community to view her as less likely to succeed. This motivated her to rise above what others in the community thought of her, hoping to honor her mother for the many sacrifices that were made while raising her. 
“If you are a child of divorce, you’re doomed to failure. You are expected to fail,” Haghighi said. “I wanted to, more than anything, write my own story and also prove [myself to] who ever doubted me.” 
After graduating as high school valedictorian, Haghighi was encouraged to pursue dentistry. She attended Ajman University of Science and Technology and graduated at the top of her class in 2015. After being exposed to the dentistry, Haghighi discovered her passion for dentistry. According to Haghighi, dentistry gave her the opportunity to connect with other students and professionals within the community. 
“When I came [to USC], I started volunteering and getting involved with everything that USC does in Mobile Clinic and [JWCH],” Haghighi said. “I saw it in person what they were doing here and the amazing things that they do.” 
Throughout her academic career, Haghighi aspires to engage with community service and outreach programs in addition to gaining clinical experience at Ostrow. Once she graduates, Haghighi intends to enter the field of oral maxillofacial surgery.
“She is a testament to the power of not letting your circumstances define you,” Sadan said. “I have total confidence in her to lead the ASPID Class of 2020.”

Former USG Director of Wellness Affairs and alumna Marina Hrovat and Vice President Blake Ackerman attended the new wellness course during the first week of classes. (Kevin Fohrer | Daily Trojan)
USC is piloting a one-unit course that aims to advise students on wellness practices and encourage healthy living. The course was created by members of the Undergraduate Student Government, the Provost’s office and the USC Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy.
OT 299, “THRIVE: Foundations of Well-Being,” teaches students a variety of wellness skills, from stress management techniques to tips for making friends in college. While the course will be geared toward first-year students in the future, it is currently being introduced to all students. 
The class will feature TED talk-style lectures from faculty guest speakers who offer expert opinion in each week’s topic, followed by a Q&A session. During the discussion portion of the class, professors and students will have the opportunity to talk [keep] incorporating those skills into their daily lives. 
USG Vice President Blake Ackerman said he has been determined to create a course on student wellness since his freshman year. During his IFC training, he completed courses in consent and alcohol education, which he wanted to share with others. Ackerman decided to take action by planning and designing the course curriculum alongside USG peers and USC professors. This fall, he was able to make his dream a reality. 
Ackerman said one of his favorite course topics is perception of success. He said the course will teach students to redefine their perceptions of success upon entering USC; the competitiveness of the school’s environment can cause some students to feel insecure about their accomplishments. This skewed success measurement is more relevant than ever with the University’s acceptance rate dropping to a record-low 13 percent for the latest class. 
“It’s clear that USC wants to continue that trend and make USC even more competitive to get into,” Ackerman said. “We want [students] to know that there are going to be times when they fail [and] there are going to be times when things don’t go their way.”
Alumna and former USG Director of Wellness Affairs Marina Hrovat also helped advocate for and develop the course. According to Hrovat, after meeting with peers and administrators throughout the 2017-18 academic year, she and Ackerman determined that students need education on topics like wellness, alcohol consumption and bystander culture outside of online models such as AlcoholEdu, an interactive online course that USC students are required to take during their first year. 
Hrovat felt students needed more opportunities to learn about stress management and self-care, in addition to skills not typically taught in academia. She hopes this course will educate all students on these skills so they can have a better experience during and after college.
“High schools aren’t setting you up to think about certain things like how to be an active bystander or self care habits [and] personal well-being,” Hrovat said. “At USC, we live in such a competitive, rigorous academic culture that students are really stretched pretty thin and suffer as a result of it.” 
Professor Ashley Uyeshiro Simon helped create the course and will also be leading it. She wants to teach students life skills like time management interactively by including games and activities during discussion sections.
After receiving feedback from students in Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 pilot courses, Uyeshiro Simon and other course designers will alter the class to better suit students’ needs. They are aiming to finalize the course by Fall 2019. In the future, Simon hopes the class will be mandatory for freshmen as she believes it teaches important skills that can benefit anyone.
“Every single upperclassman and every single faculty and staff member who we tell about this course, they all say the same thing,” Simon said. “They all say, ‘God I wish I had taken a course like that,’ because I don’t think it’s a skill that people learn really readily … yet it’s completely vital to being [healthy] for the rest of your life because it gives you some good foundational skills.” 
Ackerman said he hopes the course will teach students to value each other earlier in their college careers so they can create a caring campus community that embodies the values of the Trojan Family.
“This is a course that you can ask questions in that you probably don’t get to ask in a lot of other courses,” Ackerman said. “You can be vulnerable if you want to be, and it’ll be established as a safe space for students to really speak on what they want.”

Sophomore powerhouse outside hitter Brooke Botkin goes up for a kill against Northern Iowa where she recorded eight kills and 11 digs to lead USC to victory on Saturday morning. (Sarah Kim | Daily Trojan)
Following the Women of Troy’s dominating performance this past weekend at the Trojan Invitational, two standouts earned Pac-12 weekly awards. Sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin was named Offensive Player of the Week, and freshman setter Raquel Lázaro was selected Freshman of the Week. These honors were career firsts for both players. While the undefeated weekend was a team effort, these two players carried the load.
Hailing from Pearland, Tex., Botkin had an outstanding performance over the weekend, boasting 19 kills against Kentucky and 25 against Creighton. Her defense remained consistent with 11 and 12 digs, respectively. In the grueling five-set victory over Creighton on Saturday night, she added two aces to help ultimately put the Women of Troy on top. Botkin had a total of 52 kills throughout the three matches with a .248 hitting percentage.
“[Botkin] is really going to have a big step forward from her freshman year,” head coach Brent Crouch said prior to the season opener. “It’s going to be really fun to watch her in that position.” 
During the 2017 season, Botkin appeared in 22 matches, recording a total of 151 kills and four aces. In her best match that season, she had 20 kills and 10 digs for the first double-double of her career. She has already surpassed her best record from last season.
Lázaro made her college debut in the first match of the Trojan Invitational against the Kentucky Wildcats, stunning everyone in Galen Center with 55 assists. This marks the highest number of assists in a single match for the Trojans since Hayley Crone’s 58 assists in 2012. Against the Bluejays on Saturday night, she recorded her first career double-double with 53 assists and 22 digs. Throughout the weekend, she led the team to an impressive .248 hitting percentage and 175 kills. 
From Soria, Spain, Lázaro played for the country’s national team for six years before coming to USC. She won two gold and four silver medals with the Spanish National Team. In 2017, she made eight appearances in the European League Championships. Lázaro hopes to bring her high-level experience to the Trojans this season, a task that she has already succeeded in. 
The No. 7-ranked Trojans will travel to the University of Florida this weekend to compete in the Bubly Invitational Tournament, where their opponents include No. 4 Florida, UCF and Louisville. Botkin and Lázaro will continue to lead the team, along with junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier and senior libero Victoria Garrick. The Women of Troy are now looking to roll with their momentum and hold on to their undefeated season.

Heading into Saturday’s season opener at the Coliseum, USC won’t be ranked in the Top 10 of either the Coaches Poll or AP Top 25. In Sports Illustrated’s college football preview issue, the publication didn’t include the Trojans in its Top 20. At Pac-12 Media Day, only two people voted for the Trojans to repeat as Pac-12 Champions. Thirty-seven of 42 picked Washington. 
“Personally I love when we’re ranked lower than we should be,” said senior linebacker Cameron Smith in USC’s “One for All” video series. “I think it gives us something to fight for … I love being where we’re at right now.” 
Entering most USC football seasons, there’s a palpable sense of hype that borders on nauseating. After all, there’s a reason the term “hype train” has been banned from the Daily Trojan lexicon. 
In 2018, this preseason hysteria is nowhere to be found. And it predates success for the Trojans. 
Last year, the No. 4-ranked Trojans were clearly handicapped by this hoopla. They sputtered right out of the gate with a sluggish performance against Western Michigan. USC subsequently escaped with late victories against Texas and Cal, but couldn’t hide its deficiencies much longer. Two turnovers, nine penalties and a rough outing from quarterback Sam Darnold sealed USC’s fate in a Week 5 loss against Washington State. 
The Trojans wouldn’t crack the Top 10 for the rest of the regular season. 
Unlike last year, USC doesn’t come into 2018 with ridiculously high expectations, mainly because most of last year’s flashiest and most productive players are now in the NFL. 
“We don’t have a star,” said Smith in the same video, echoing his head coach. “We don’t have a Sam Darnold, we don’t have a Ronald Jones. But at the end of the year, we’re going to have stars.” 
One of those “stars” could be freshman quarterback JT Daniels. 
Daniels — a product of Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif. — should be in high school right now. Instead, he skipped his senior season to join the Trojans a year early. Most high school juniors take lots of naps and study on occasion (maybe I’m projecting a bit). Meanwhile, Daniels was taking extra classes and studying USC’s spring practices. 
His unlikely journey to USC reached its climax on Sunday, with head coach Clay Helton naming the 18-year old as the team’s starting quarterback. He beat out sophomores Matt Fink and Jack Sears, both of whom failed to distance themselves in spring practice — before Daniels arrived on campus. 
Replacing a Top 3 NFL Draft pick at quarterback is no easy task, especially for a true-true freshman. But offensive coordinator Tee Martin won’t ask Daniels to be Darnold. In fact, Daniels remaining true to himself may be better for the Trojans. 
For all of his clutch plays, impossible throws and schoolyard scrambles, Darnold also had a bad habit of giving the ball to the other team. 
He threw 13 interceptions and fumbled 12 times in 2017, which directly affected USC’s win-loss record. Against Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl, Darnold fumbled twice and tacked on an interception. The Trojans would manage just one touchdown in the loss, despite out-gaining the Buckeyes 413-277. 
Daniels doesn’t need to throw for 4,000 yards and a gazillion touchdowns in order for USC to be successful. He just needs to avoid turnovers and complete key passes when called upon. 
By reclassifying and immediately starting, Daniels is doing the unprecedented. However, true freshmen quarterbacks leading their programs to the mountaintop is not. Last year’s national championship game became a duel between two freshmen signal callers — Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa and Georgia’s Jake Fromm. Both were 19 years old when the game kicked off. Daniels, the reigning Gatorade High School Athlete of the Year, turns 19 in February. 
Of course, Tagovailoa and Fromm were backed by elite defenses. USC’s defense is far from SEC-caliber, but it should be the class of the Pac-12. The group returns the crux of last year’s secondary, plus loads of talent at linebacker. Smith and fellow senior college football expert Phil Steele ranked both position groups as the best in the conference.
“That group is obviously the strength of our team,” Helton said. “And defense wins championships.”
During the past two years, USC’s defense has led the nation in sacks. They’ve contained Stanford’s Bryce Love, intercepted UCLA’s Josh Rosen and rattled Washington’s Jake Browning. The talent and experience is there. Now, they just need to find consistency. 
USC’s season will not be a cakewalk. The schedule’s first half is riddled with grueling match-ups, like road trips to No. 13 Stanford, No. 23 Texas and Arizona. But a return to the Pac-12 Championship — at the very least — is not impossible. The team just needs to avoid a slow start and play with discipline. Ten seniors in the starting lineup should help in both regards. 
Unshackled by hype, USC dives into 2018 with something to prove, rather than something to defend. That spells danger for the rest of the Pac-12.

JT Daniels speaks to the media after Tuesday’s practice for the first time since Helton announced on Sunday that he earned the starting spot over Matt Fink and Jack Sears. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The announcement of freshman JT Daniels as the Trojans’ starting quarterback Sunday felt long overdue, even though redshirt freshman Jack Sears and redshirt sophomore Matt Fink both competed hard.
After Tuesday’s practice, Daniels met with the media for the first time as the team’s starting quarterback. 
Daniels’ high school pedigree was never in question. The 2018 Gatorade Player of the Year threw for 4,123 yards and 52 touchdowns compared to only four interceptions on 71 percent passing in his final high school season, while leading Mater Dei High School to a California state title. 
“I was very excited and just super honored that [head coach Clay Helton] gave me the privilege to take ownership of this team,” Daniels said. “But, you know, it still goes back to that I’ve got a lot more work to do. I still haven’t even played a game yet. Very honored, but there’s a lot more to go.” 
The 6-foot-3, 210-pound freshman arrived at USC as a five-star recruit, with tremendous expectations to be the next great USC quarterback. However, the job wasn’t going to be handed to him with Fink and Sears waiting in the wings. Daniels didn’t back down as the competition at the position began, lighting up the team’s first scrimmage to the tune of four touchdowns on 10-of-12 passing. He’s shown incredible arm talent from the beginning, fitting the ball into impossibly tight windows and hitting receivers right in stride 50 yards downfield. 
Another key piece of Daniels’ game throughout camp has been his uncanny connection with high school teammate and supremely talented freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown. St. Brown and Daniels have been a lethal duo, connecting on play after play as if they can read each other’s minds. 
Although Daniels’ first practice as the team’s starting quarterback was very run-heavy, he still continued to look impressive on his opportunities. His trademark confidence in the pocket and ability to make incredibly accurate throws were on display.
“We’ll find out Saturday what enough time is, but coach handled the whole process excellently,” Daniels said when asked if the announcement a week in advance was enough time. “I feel confident that I have a good understanding of the playbook, and we’ve just got to go out and execute Saturday. There’s not any excuse I can make.” 
Helton talked about what set Daniels apart from the other quarterbacks. 
“We said the whole time the decision-making was going to be a huge part of the process, and he made good decisions for the most part,” Helton said. “There were mistakes at times, but I thought for the most part it was good. And this week, him getting the starter’s reps will really benefit him.” 
Now all that remains to be seen is what Daniels does with his opportunity, starting this Saturday in the Coliseum.
Gustin returns
The biggest news of the day came with the return of outside linebacker Porter Gustin. The senior, who was named a team captain last week, had been held out of practice since the beginning of fall camp when he tore his meniscus. He was a full-go on Tuesday, practicing in pads and participating in full contact team sessions and drills. He looked strong and explosive for someone so shortly removed from an injury of that magnitude. It’s a welcome sign to see him in such solid form at the start of the opening week.
“I feel pretty confident right now. We’ll see — this was a contact day. We’ll see how it reacts after a good day of work,” head coach Clay Helton said on Gustin’s ability to play this weekend. “Two things always go into it for me in a decision: one, did the doctors clear him to play. And then two, is he confident he wants to play. If he’s confident and the doctor says he’s clear, we’ll pull that trigger. If either one’s a no, then we’ll wait for the next game.” 
Gustin has the ability to be a dominant player for the Trojan defense. Having him active on game days will be a dramatic boost to the team.
Two transfers
In other news, Helton announced the transfers of redshirt junior safety Ykili Ross and redshirt freshman cornerback Je’Quari Godfrey. The announcement of Ross transfer came as no surprise, as it had initially been reported last Saturday. The senior entered camp leading the competition for the starting strong safety spot, but a hamstring injury derailed him for the entirety of camp until last week. By that time, the job had gone to Bubba Bolden, and Ross had an outburst during practice last week on Wednesday that caused him to be sidelined for the rest of the day. Ross will finish his degree at USC this fall before transferring as a graduate. 
Godfrey finds himself buried on the depth chart at cornerback, behind a talented group of young corners, which likely played a part in his decision to transfer. Helton wished both players the best of luck in their future endeavors.

Mac and cheese. It’s the perfect comfort food — a satiating blend of carbs and cheesy creaminess. After a stressful day of school, it’s a perfect treat to make yourself feel just a little better. Fortunately, USC’s campus has no shortage of mac and cheese options. 
The Daily Trojan has sampled every prepared mac and cheese (there are 10 of them!) that students can get on campus or at USC Village. Here is a definitive ranking to all the cheesy goodness you can get: 
Wahlburgers
Price: $6.95
This is undoubtedly the most disappointing mac and cheese option out there. Wahlburgers describes it as being made with cheddar and smoked mozzarella, which sounds like it would make a tangy, earthy cheese sauce, but I’m not sure you can even call the final product a sauce; it tastes more like they took a piece of processed American cheese and barely melted it into a gooey mess. That mess is then simply plopped on top of penne pasta, not mixed in, and too thick to properly mix. Added to that, the penne is undercooked, resulting in an incongruous, completely bland eating experience. The garlic parmesan breadcrumb garnish is a necessary addition to the dish, but it doesn’t do enough to save it. Also, it comes in a relatively small portion only slightly larger than that of Seeds’, yet it costs more than double the price: a whopping $6.95. Not a good look, Wahlburgers. 
Everybody’s Kitchen
Price: N/A
Despite visible spices like bits of parsley and black pepper, EVK’s mac offering is a very one-dimensional cheese flavor. The sauce itself is quite runny, and has a slight, unpleasant curdled texture. Although it  looks like the Village Dining Hall’s mac and cheese — elbow macaroni with bright yellow sauce — the taste is considerably worse If you’re going to go to a dining hall for Mac and cheese, make it the Village. 
Moreton and Fig 
Price: $7.50
For such a fancy restaurant, it’s offering of mac and cheese is only average. It starts with penne pasta that’s too small foreach bite to hold much sauce. The sauce is great — it’s creamy and velvety, and packs a buttery, perfectly spiced flavor — but it hardly passes for a cheese sauce. It has hints of cheese flavor, but it isn’t the star of the show, as it should be in a good mac and cheese. The breadcrumbs sprinkled on top add a good balance to the texture, but they’re too fine, so the texture can become slightly grainy and unappealing. The price of $7.50 is reasonable for a restaurant like Moreton Fig, but the portion is still relatively small.
California Pizza Kitchen
Price: $7.29
CPK tries too hard on what it bills as chipotle mac and cheese. It’s taken the item off the menu at  Ronald Tutor Campus Center, but it’ll still make it for you if you ask. The sauce is creamy and cheesy enough, but it falls flat in flavor. It’s riddled with large pieces of cilantro, creating an unpleasant imbalance in taste from bite to bite, and the spice overpowers any flavor the cheese brings to the table. Twists on mac and cheese, like adding sriracha or other complementary flavors is a great way to elevate the relatively simple dish, but sometimes simplicity is the best feature of a good mac, especially one meant to be a comfort food. At $7.29, the dish is reasonably priced for a full meal.
Lemonade 
Price: $4.95
Tastewise, this mac and cheese is just fine. It doesn’t try to accomplish much with its flavor, so it delivers a traditional cheesy flavor. But while the taste is fine, the texture is lacking. The sauce is almost definitely made with a bechamel base, a cream sauce thickened by flour. This means that the already heavy carb load that the overcooked mac delivers is bolstered by another layer of carbs in the sauce. No one’s eating mac and cheese to be healthy, but the result is a glob of one-note mac that is way too heavy and leaves munchers feeling queasy. At $4.95 for such a small portion, don’t go out of your way for this mac — you’re better off spending the extra $0.50 on Lemonade’s Truffle Mac and Cheese.
USC Village Dining Hall
Price: N/A
When you think of mac and cheese, the image that appears in your mind is exactly what the Village mac and cheese looks like — elbow macaroni with a bright yellow sauce that’s smooth yet slightly elastic. While it looks delicious, USC Village Dining Hall’s mac lacks  flavor, except for the subtlest, most out-of-place chili aftertaste. But the beauty of any dining hall dish is there is plenty of room for customization. Think of this bland mac and cheese as a blank canvas that can be elevated in any number of ways. Treat the salad bar like a condiment bar, and add your favorite flavors to make this mac more complex. I enjoy adding chopped scallions, for a nice crunch and slight sharp flavor. 
The Lab Gastropub
Price: $10
Of the mac and cheeses on this list, the Lab’s has the most potent and complex flavor. The cheese is earthy and herbaceous, but simultaneously  tangy and buttery. The sauce is dotted with bits of black and pink peppercorn, which add a great balance to the flavor and a bit of bite to the dish. Texture-wise the dish isn’t great: the elbow macaroni is much bigger than traditional macaroni, creating a slightly cumbersome eating experience, and despite advertising breadcrumbs on their menu, the dish has none, creating a mostly one-note texture. At $10, it’s the most expensive mac and cheese on the list, but it’s also a sizeable full meal portion. 
Seeds 
Price: $2.49
Creating the perfect mac and cheese sauce is largely about striking the right balance between the cheesiness and creaminess of the sauce. If it’s too creamy, flavor will be lost; but if it’s too cheesy, the texture might not be smooth enough to make the pasta and the sauce cohesive. Of all the options, Seeds’ mac and cheese has the most balance. Each bite is creamy, but retains some stretchy cheese that adds nuance and flavor to the dish. Besides this, the pasta is largely traditional, sticking to elbow macaroni and simple spices — the only qualm about the dish is that it’s quite greasy. Seeds serves the smallest portion, but also the cheapest at $2.49, so it makes for a perfect quick snack to eat between classes. 
Lemonade 
Price: $5.50
A good mac and cheese has a variety of textures. For most dishes, that means including breadcrumbs or drizzling a layer of melted cheese with the pasta and sauce. But there’s a way to create multiple textures with just a pasta and sauce — and Lemonade’s white truffle mac and cheese accomplishes it well. While Lemonade’s traditional counterpart features overcooked pasta that makes it nearly indistinguishable from its very thick sauce, the white truffle mac and cheese pairs al dente elbow macaroni with a much creamier bechamel sauce, creating a perfect balance of consistencies. And the sauce on its own is a winner — the white truffle adds a subtle earthy flavor to the tangy mac, creating a multifaceted burst of flavor in every bite. At $5.50, the dish is a bit pricey for its small size, but the flavor is worth it. . 
Honeybird
Price: $5.00
Honeybird’s generous tray of mac and cheese perfectly captures the true essence of this traditional comfort food while also setting itself apart from the rest of the pack. The dish starts with jumbo, conch shell-shaped pasta — the pasta wraps around on itself, creating a large pocket that allows for the highest cheese-to-pasta ratio. This is particularly great, as the sauce is almost irresistible. With a five-cheese blend, a perfect mix of subtle spices and a dash of cilantro, Honeybird’s sauce manages to deliver all of the creaminess patrons expect from a great mac and cheese without being too heavy or dense. That would be great on its own, but Honeybird takes it a step further, topping the dish with a hefty helping of mozzarella and just enough breadcrumbs to add a dynamic texture without overpowering its primary flavors. Plus, it’s only $5 — an affordable deal for anyone on a college student’s budget. 
Ultimately, Honeybird has an affordable, full meal option to satisfy any mac and cheese craving that also tastes much better than those of any of its competitors. For a quicker, on-campus snack that can be bought with dining dollars for, Seeds is the way to go — just avoid Wahlburgers.

Entertainer and former 2PM member Jay Park performed at Koreatown’s Arena Ultra Lounge on Monday night for a pop-up show. (Matthew Philips | Daily Trojan)
On Monday, hundreds of fans lined up outside the front doors of Koreatown’s Arena Ultra Lounge for the chance to catch artist and entertainer Jay Park perform in an intimate setting. As part of a joint effort to increase usership and promote the Jay-Z-curated Made In America Festival, streaming service TIDAL teamed up with clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch for a series of pop-up shows across the country. Admission was free, but proof of either TIDAL or A&F Club membership was required for entry. 
This past week featured Park in Los Angeles and bedroom pop sensation Clairo in Columbus, Ohio. Curiously enough, TIDAL advertised the pop-ups for Park and Clairo on Twitter by claiming that the shows would be hosted at universities, with Park’s at USC and Clairo’s at The Ohio State University. However, the exact time and location would not be revealed unless fans RSVP’d online, and, upon doing so, it became apparent that Park’s show was neither at USC nor USC-affiliated. 
Even so, without university backing, the pop-up attracted hordes of young and college-age fans to the nightclub’s front, many of them waiting outside for hours. Shortly before the show’s scheduled 7 p.m. door time, the queue stretched around the block, with fans clamoring to secure one of the mere 200 tickets that would be handed out that evening. Upon entry, patrons were greeted with free TIDAL-themed merchandise, from tote bags to bandanas to free membership cards.
Inside, the intimate club equipped with a skilled DJ and ear-splitting speakers provided for the perfect setting for fans to unwind their nervous energy. Backdropped by a vibrant LED-powered screen, the DJ pumped up the crowd with a seemingly endless arsenal of club hits both old and new. From strip club staples like Drake’s “The Motto” and Migos’ “Fight Night,” to 90s skating rink classics like Mark Morrison’s “Return of the Mack” and “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” the DJ kept the warm-up tunes fresh and diverse. He also took time to flash his technical skills and curation abilities, seamlessly transitioning from the Backstreet Boys’ nostalgic “I Want It That Way” to Juvenile’s club-toppling “Back That Azz Up.”

However, logistical issues prevented Park from hitting the stage at a convenient time, and the audience grew impatient. The DJ continued to reach back into his wheelhouse of club bangers, even inviting a hype man onstage to work the crowd. After half an hour of honest attempts to win back the room with novelty tunes and Latin pop classics, the pair on stage were greeted with static energy and requests to bring Park to the stage.
Finally, Park took the stage shortly after 9 p.m., and the room’s energy shifted immediately. The swarm of erratic screams and squeals almost drowned out Park at first, but a quick tweak to the rapper’s microphone quickly remedied the situation. Park’s crisp blend of hip-hop, pop and electronic dance music produces a deafeningly mainstream sound that is as accessible as it is familiar. The squeaky clean instrumentation and sugary vocals seemed engineered to offend as few people as possible, and they succeeded in doing so at this performance. 
Here, Park showcased his many talents as he rapped, sang and danced with ease — all that was left was to project a clip from his acting career. During his more pop-influenced material, Park opted to tap his background as a breakdancer, flashing his impressive moves with a pair of backup dancers. Alas, an exhausted and impatient crowd stopped dancing, and Park concluded the set after about 30 minutes.
In all, the pop-up served as an enjoyable escape from the Monday blues. The opportunity to see a multidimensional performer and entertainer like Park is often elusive, but TIDAL and Abercrombie provided the ideal venue for 200 lucky fans to catch this experience. Judging from the success of the initial pop-up, Park’s return to Los Angeles should be a can’t-miss event.

Fourteen years ago, one of the world’s largest social networking sites was conceived on a snowy college campus in Cambridge, Mass. “The Facebook” was an immediate success; its virality was contingent upon users encouraging their friends to create profiles.
At age 19, Mark Zuckerberg unexpectedly tapped into the psyche of college students, excited at the prospect of establishing interpersonal connections through the click of a mouse. He created a tantalizing tool that contained the blueprint for a service many platforms are now seeking to revive: exclusive, college-centric communities where individuals can build relationships. 
But that revival, now spearheaded by apps like Tinder and Instagram, is not ideal in an online environment where superficial connections are most common.
Just last week, online dating app Tinder announced the creation of its college-only feature, Tinder U, where students with “.edu” email addresses can register and connect more directly with those on their campuses and others at nearby colleges. The intention was not solely romantic, but also for networking and friend-seeking purposes. 
Days later, Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, also released its beta-tested version of virtual college communities. Users are prompted to include their graduating year and major in their Instagram bio, which automatically enlists them in a database with other students at their respective universities.
College students are arguably the most appealing demographic to companies looking to expand their reach: They’re young adults with disposable income, and are looking to live the best four years of their lives. 
But as a group, students are not sustainable consumers in a virtual world inundated by social platforms. They are still more likely to meet others in-person than online, simply through interactions and events occurring on campus. 
Tinder and Instagram’s services hint that they’re trying to build an online community students can eventually integrate into their real lives, and whether that networking format will succeed is now being tested. 
However, there are a few things these platforms can learn from what is, in my opinion, the most fascinating app to grace the collegiate scene: Yik Yak, an anonymous messaging app that was worth $400 million before its demise. Yik Yak was an engaging, exciting phenomenon where users would anonymously post messages and see others’ in the vicinity. People would solicit hookups, spread rumors or post the most random incidents occurring in their daily lives, and it was immensely popular among high school and college-aged students.
Yik Yak was soon replaced by Snapchat. “These businesses, though sporting promising user growth, never seemed to grow large enough to sustain themselves,” The Verge wrote about apps like Yik Yak.
And that’s the problem with what Tinder and Instagram are trying to offer to college students. Platforms are encouraging the growth of smaller, niche groups on their apps to increase genuine engagement. But these apps must also recognize there is an eventual limit to social interaction, and should instead work to encourage healthier user habits.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
After the indictments of U.S. President Donald Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the national dialogue has been swirling with one question: Did the president commit a crime?
The answer to that question is obvious, even if issues of campaign finance and foreign collusion have been momentarily overlooked. Trump absolutely did commit a crime: sexual assault. 
In 2005, a then-59-year-old Trump was sitting in the back of a bus at the Access Hollywood studio, stirring up crass conversation with “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush. 
The future president said, with remarkable candor, that he is automatically attracted to beautiful women, that he cannot control himself when he is around beautiful women and that because he is a successful man, he can get away with grabbing women “by the p-ssy.” 
After the tape was released, several women close to Trump at the time confirmed that he touched their genital areas without consent. 
Grabbing anyone by their genitals without consent amounts to sexual assault, a crime that deserves punishment whether it is committed by a groundskeeper or the soon-to-be leader of the free world. Despite outrage from commentators, voters, legal experts and politicians of both parties, Trump was elected president one month after the tape was released, defeating Hillary Clinton, the first woman to obtain a major party’s nomination. Sixty-three million Americans didn’t view sexual assault as a disqualifying trait. 
As damning as Trump’s own words were, there is the possibility that Trump wasn’t telling the truth on that bus. Perhaps Trump was so hungry for Bush’s admiration that he made up a story about being a sexual predator. If this is the case, Trump’s credibility as both a truthful man and a viable moral agent is questionable. If Trump was willing to falsely implicate himself in an attempt to entertain Bush, why should the American people believe he’s telling the truth when he denies collusion with the Russians in order to maintain his presidency? Either the president is sexually violent or he’s a misogynistic liar. Either possibility suggests he is a criminal. 
It is disheartening to see a president’s confession to sexual violence take a back seat in the national dialogue. It hurts to see that few care enough to remain outraged about this specific wrongdoing committed by Trump, but it also hurts that critics simply do not have time to dwell on it due to Trump’s tsunami of unethical leadership decisions. 
By stacking up individual atrocities, Trump has effectively diluted the severity of his wrongs in the court of public opinion, effectively rendering each charge docile. It’s hard to hit a moving target. 
Sexual assault signifies an evil entitlement that is unacceptable at any level of society. Either Trump holds that entitlement or he has no grasp on the necessity of truth. When considering the 18 women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, including several accusations of sexual assault, and Trump’s history of lying to his constituents, it seems that both cases are most likely true.
A disturbing parallel arises when considering USC in the context of this Trumpian nightmare. USC has adopted an aggressive approach to sexual misconduct (at least in cases where the Los Angeles Times gets involved), leading to stricter enforcement of its existing policies. It pains me to say this, but the executive branch of the federal government is now held to a lower moral threshold than USC, one of the most scandal-plagued schools in the country. 
It is also striking to note that if the USC Office of Admission, or any office of admission for that matter, were to discover a tape of one of their applicants proclaiming their entitlement to grab another person’s genitals without consent, that applicant would be rejected outright. From that, it is fair to surmise that currently — from at least a moral standpoint — being a student at USC is a more selective position than that of our country’s commander-in-chief. This is not something to be proud of.
