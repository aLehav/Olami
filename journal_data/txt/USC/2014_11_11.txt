Until a relationship goes by the wayside like a VHS tape, the thought of, “Are they cheating?” will creep up every now and then. There’s no point in kidding yourself that the possibility of your partner cheating won’t be at the forefront of your brain as long as you’re together.
As we all know, good decisions in matters of love are rarely made with unclouded vision. To actually be cheating on someone, however, there has to have been commitment in the relationship in the first place.
Talk it out · There are many warning signs to look out for if you suspect your significant other of cheating. Though even if one sees some of these potential telltale signs, this is no substitute for good communication. — Photo illustration by Mariya Dondonyan
Infidelity can cause even the most solid relationships to fall apart, and it’s no different with college students. After all, it was our very own President Clinton who told the entire American people on national television that he “did not have sexual relations with that woman.” Thus, men and women were misled to believe that giving or receiving oral sex does not fit into the equation of cheating — but clearly, that’s not the case. My opinion is a lot more straightforward — if you so much as put your hands on someone else of the opposite sex, you’re crossing a line that labels you a cheater.
So let’s try and define a relationship and commitment so we might ascertain whether or not you have a cheater on your hands.
The Oxford English Dictionary has no fewer than six definitions with subheadings for commitment:
“The action of committing, in various senses: the action of entrusting, giving in charge or commending; the committing of oneself, or being committed to a particular course of conduct.”
The term “relationship,” is defined as, “The position which one person holds with respect to another on account of some social or other connection between them: the particular mode in which persons are mutually connected by circumstances.”
But the fact is that everyone in a relationship has at some point thought about cheating, or being cheated on, or has done the actual misdeed.
Let’s say that both parties in a relationship agreed to be exclusive. If a promise of faithfulness has been implied, disloyalty can happen. Cheating is never acceptable. It causes significant emotional pain for your partner, not to mention the possibility that the person you are cheating with might do the same thing to you later. But don’t blame the cheater’s partner unless you know them personally; it’s the cheater’s responsibility to remain faithful. If the person your significant other cheated with happens to be one of your friends, however, dump them.
So how can you tell if someone is cheating? Though countless articles have been published on how to “spot a cheater,” it is a bit more complex for college students. There is no substitute for effective communication. Before you go accusing someone, think the following scenarios through carefully. Below is a list of tell-tale signs of cheating, in my opinion, and some are personal examples of how I figured out how I was being cheated on. If you answer “yes” to even one or two questions, you’re not just paranoid, something might be brewing. Open up the lines of communication. If they turn it around on you immediately, it might be time to look into things more carefully.
First, follow your instincts. It is the best indicator that something has become amiss in your once blissful relationship. Another potential indicator is that their phone is all of a sudden always on lockdown or airplane mode. In addition, a decrease in the amount of texting between you could mean something, unless you’ve communicated that you have a very busy week ahead of you.
A bad sign is when a simple, “What are you doing?” turns into a fight. Others would be that they are suddenly in or at places they had never mentioned before, or they don’t share their class schedule with you. If they start looking spruced up or they shrug off the compliments that you give them when you notice they are looking really good, this could also be bad news.
Be aware of what they do for fun. If they suddenly are going out with friends you’ve never heard of or you see them with different girls/boys from the group you normally party with, this could mean something deeper.
There are a few ways to tell if their interest in hanging out with you has faded. One of these is if they start meeting you only off-campus or in their apartment. Another is if you no longer meet for a quick lunch or a hello between classes, or if they no longer ask for help with papers or homework.
Sometimes the perspective from someone removed from the situation can be more informative than your own; for example if your friends no longer asks what “you guys” are doing or if their friends can’t look you in the eye that could mean trouble.
Finally, if their parents were on campus, and you were not invited out with them, or better yet, you didn’t even know they were in town, it might be time to ask some questions.

Manic. That’s one word you might use to describe the thumping, groovy, throbbing electro-house genre. It’s full of crazed energy and sounds that cause pulsations throughout the body. With a ‘k’ and letters stylized in all caps, MANIK becomes the stage name of Brooklyn-based producer and D.J. Chris Manik.
Making the change · Chris Manik joked about swapping the delis and pizza of New York for the tacos and Asian cuisine of Los Angeles, but described his transition to the Los Angeles music scene as relatively smooth. – Photo courtesy of MANIK
Manik grew up in Brooklyn, immersed in a variety of different music cultures, from East Coast hip hop to electronic house. In junior high school, he made significant strides into his own musical exploration, delving into two opposing styles: trumpet on one hand and electronic samples, bootlegs and software programs on the other. The former gave him a basic understanding of musical theory; the latter would encourage a high school hobby, then something to pursue in college and, eventually, his career.
“I decided I would take a chance and give myself a little bit of time to struggle but I told myself I was going to do this for a year or two and live real humble and see what happens,” Manik said. “I thought, ‘If it works, it works.’”
And so it did. Within two years, Manik had produced a couple of EPs. Once labels started picking up his work, others expressed interest, and he found himself churning out seven additional EPs in a year.
After spending his life in Brooklyn and moving to upstate New York for college afterward, Manik has packed his equipment (most of it, at least) and made the transition to Los Angeles. The cities don’t differ too drastically — Manik said he’s swapped the delis and pizza of the Big Apple for tacos and Asian cuisine since arriving -— but he’s still working to make Silver Lake home.
“When I had a studio in New York, I had a bunch of cool lights in my studio that would help me in the creative process,” Manik said. “I don’t mean dirty strobe, in-your-face so you have a heart attack. Just cool, vibey Christmas lights and try to seduce myself — not really — but turn my brain on and start thinking about music.”
Manik has certainly been thinking about music. He drops an EP on Dec. 15 and two more in January and February in addition to stoking the fires of his side project Shadow Lanes, but there’s not too much he can do with a lot of his gear still in transit.
Manik said one of the most noticeable changes between the East and West Coasts can be found in club culture. On the East Coast, bars are open and serve alcohol much later, sometimes until 5 a.m. (“and nobody bothers you”), which differs vastly from the strict 2 a.m. closing time out West. Since coming to Southern California, Manik said he noticed that this enabled a more vibrant after-party scene than he normally would experience on the East.
“As far as music is concerned, for the most part New York is in a really good place right now. It’s deep house, techno and a lot of that music in general,” Manik said. “Out here [in Los Angeles], there’s that emphasis but I think it’s a little more big room-oriented still.”
Big room alludes to a kind of style of house music that is upbeat with an emphasis on a bass that leads to what is often called “the drop.” It’s a style that likely permeates the L.A. house electronic scene because of the city’s proximity to festivals and carnivals, Manik said. In the world of electro house music, it can be considered pretty taboo, rudimentary, stale and lacking originality.
But Manik isn’t the kind of artist to adhere to a specific genre. He lets his musical influences guide him and won’t hesitate to incorporate bits of hip-hop and indie rock into his music.
“People sometimes think that I just make too many different styles, or maybe I’m a little bit all over the place,” he said. “I just have so many interests in different kinds of music. It’s not just me trying to be a smartass or be different. It’s just me. That’s just naturally who I am.”
Manik is aware that people outside the genre of electronic music, those who confuse D.J.s and producers, will cling to the stereotype that his music is for gigantic raves and not much more.
“At the end of the day, music is pretty f–king cool. It’s meant to be a reflection of yourself and to be shared and enjoyed with people,” he said. “It’s more than just rave and big-room. There’s so much cool, low-key, vibey stuff that’s out there that I think is pretty important for people to listen to as well. A little bit of both.”
MANIK plays Friday, Nov. 14, alongside other multiple artists as part of the A Club Called Rhonda series at Club Los Globos in Silver Lake.

Logging into Facebook or refreshing Instagram can result in thousands of photos of everything from people’s nights out to their elaborate meals. Snapchat allows photos to be taken and sent off, only to be deleted moments later. It seems with every passing day, a new photography-based app comes into existence. But as we swipe so quickly through each filtering option, is there something we’re missing?
Wealth of experience · Geoffrey Hiller has been photographing everyday life in Southeast Asia for over two decades. He describes a great photo as a moment in time, and know his best photos are when his presence isn’t felt. – Photo courtesy of Geoffrey Hiller
Photojournalist Geoffrey Hiller believes so. Hiller feels that in this frenzied, extremely photographed world, it’s important to slow down.
“Especially in these times with mobile photography and people posting photographs as often as they do, it helps to slow down a little bit,” he said.
Hiller has been photographing everyday life in Southeast Asian countries for more than 25 years. This Thursday, Nov. 13, he will speak at the Annenberg Space for Photography about what he has learned from his many experiences as a photographer.
Hiller’s message about experiencing the subjects of his photography will be the focus of his discussion at the event. He maintains that slowing down and reflecting on the works is engrained at the core of his process.
Hiller said there is a difference between taking the photograph and editing it. When a photographer is out in the field clicking away with their camera, it’s easy to become oblivious to what’s actually happening within the frame. This is why reflecting and taking time to edit is vital. Hiller remembers a time when he reviewed a set of photos a year after taking them and only then realized the tension in them.
“When you take a photograph, you can’t be thinking about it. You think about it before and after. Think about it and let it percolate in your head,” Hiller said.
The depth of each photograph he takes in the region is what drew Hiller to Southeast Asia, particularly Burma, a country not well recognized in the West. He first visited the country in 1987, but it was his visit in 2000 that had the greatest impact on him. The country was very isolated, and the people were wary of speaking to foreigners. Hiller approached people who were were working along the docks and hauling 100 pound bags of rice, but despite their hardships, when they talked with Hiller, they did so without self-pity. It was a humbling experience for Hiller, and one that made him decide he had to do something with his photos. As a result, he came out of the country with 90 rolls of film.
“They have a sense of resilience and grace at the same time,” Hiller said of the people of Burma.
Among other things, this impression is what Hiller hopes people will understand through his works.
“Hopefully when people see the photographs, it will cause them to reflect and to ask deeper questions than what’s on the surface,” he said.
For Hiller, the emotion of the people and the places he visits is what he’s trying to most capture. He jokes that he’s a romantic because when he takes photos, he looks for the beauty. But beneath the casual laughter that laces his words, there’s a sense of hope. It’s obvious when talking to Hiller that his travels have been life-changing, and all he really wants is for the audience to get the same sense of awe from his photos that he gets from his experiences abroad.
His lecture will display 80 photos, but reflection and editing played an important role in their selection. Hiller notes that there is a language for photographers; photos normally just stand out upon review. Every now and then, however, he notes that there are quiet gems that take serious reviewing.
For Hiller, “great photos are moments in time. It has to do with light, composition and, most importantly, the emotional integrity and impact of the photograph.” The greatness also comes from the absence of the photographer — Hiller knows his photos are great when his presence isn’t felt by the viewer.
“On the one hand, I’m talking about being meditative and reflective, on the other hand, when I’m out their photographing, it’s like a trance state,” Hiller said. “I’m trying to immerse myself, pick up on the place, the sense of place, because each place is different. If it’s Vietnam, Brazil, Southern California, there’s a special — I don’t want to say — essence, for me. There’s a feeling.”
Along with his discussion of the importance of slowing down, Hiller will also talk about his photography and how he got involved with the industry. In addition to his lecture, he made a documentary titled Grace Under Pressure, which is available online, as well as a book, Daybreak in Myanmar, which features 170 photographs and six interviews with historians, authors and activists.

In the midst of the urban grey concrete and aluminum of the warehouse district sits an airy sanctuary with a focus on health and wellness, a rare commodity in the hustle and bustle of downtown Los Angeles. The Springs’ emphasis on well-being, community and especially health and sustainability is abundantly evident in all their endeavors.
Worth a try · The Springs offers a selection of delicious juices. They range from relatively mild combinations (strawberry, blood orange and lemon) to more inventive ones (pineapple, cucumber, cilantro and jalapeño). – Photo courtesy of The Springs
The 13,800-square-foot warehouse overhauled by co-founders Jared Stein and Kimberly Helms houses a yoga studio, juice bar, 92-seat restaurant and wellness center, all with a focus on personal wellness and detoxification for the health guru in anyone.
The open, breezy atmosphere of The Springs immediately puts customers at ease. Its décor, made entirely of sustainable materials, of course, is eclectic and colorful, providing just enough cheerfulness to the previously grey space. This, coupled with the giant, always-open doors and huge skylights makes for a breezy aesthetic that provides a breath of fresh air to even the most harried of guests.
Yoga at The Springs is an intimate experience. The extensive schedule of classes offers every kind of yoga imaginable in sessions taught by a variety of experienced, passionate instructors for yogis of all skill levels. Saturday morning Power Flow yoga with Shayn Almedia required a lot of strength, but his individual attention and careful explanation made even the most difficult poses relaxing and fun. For just $15 a class, with mats and accessories available for rent, The Springs is a markedly excellent yoga studio — but that’s just the beginning.
Yoga is the perfect precursor to a meal at The Springs. Its raw, vegan, organic menu sounds like an instant turnoff for many, but the artfully crafted salad, entree and dessert plates, albeit unusual, are uniquely savory.
The tea leaf salad is an invigorating blend of avocado, cherry tomatoes, cilantro, sprouts and pumpkin seeds over green tea leaves and kale and topped off with chili-lime vinaigrette. The vinaigrette adds an unexpected bite to the exceptionally fresh salad, and manages to make even the kale taste good.
The Springs salad is a more mild take on an equally healthy salad. Topped with fresh apples, green grapes, maple walnuts and pistachio-lemon vinaigrette, this salad doesn’t have the zest that the tea leaf salad does, but is certainly not lacking in flavor. It does still have an element of surprise — the peppered macadamia chevre on top adds the perfect amount of zing.
The juices, though overpriced, are delicious and, once again, incredibly fresh. Their bright, vibrant colors make each of the 10 juices look vivid and mouthwatering in their glass bottles. With names from “Forager” and “Rucksack” to “Bug Bite” and “Skinny Dip,” the irresistible juices bring out the adventurer in even the most reluctant of customers. From mild combinations, like the strawberry, apple, blood orange and lemon “Bug Bite,” to peculiar ones, like the pineapple, cucumber, cilantro and jalapeno “Lantern,” the juices are worth a try — even a $9 try.
The “Bug Bite” is a safe bet; the lemon adds just enough zip to an otherwise sweet, tame juice that will satisfy any palate. The “Rucksack,” on the other hand, isn’t for the faint of heart. Its carrot, coconut, lemongrass, ginger and lime combination practically screams “tree hugger,” but in a surprisingly tasty way.
The Springs also offers smoothies, milks, ice creams, sweets and snacks on their extensive menu, all of which are fresh, homemade and stay true to the center’s raw, organic health mission.
The Springs’ atmosphere provides a welcoming space for even the unhealthiest of patrons — no, they won’t serve cheeseburgers, but the hipster wait staff wouldn’t judge anyone who asked. The refreshing take on a trendy restaurant is both unique and invigorating and the whole space provides an enlivening place to eat, drink, practice yoga or participate in wellness ventures including massage, acupuncture, reiki and an infrared sauna.
L.A. health nuts have long awaited the day when all their favorite services were under one roof — taking the metro back and forth to a juice bar, yoga studio and massage parlor just doesn’t provide the relaxing aspect of a day spent all in one place — and The Springs delivers. The culmination of airy atmosphere, friendly staff and holistic wellness focus makes The Springs a place customers want to visit and never leave. Its menu, though pricey, is fresh and worth treating oneself to for a healthy and refreshing meal. The Springs’ yoga program, though, may be its most impressive aspect. Reasonably priced classes with seasoned, solicitous instructors are an especially rare find in downtown Los Angeles, but The Springs has created the perfect combination of all of the above.
The Springs, located at 608 Mateo St., is now open Monday through Thursday, 7 a.m, to 11 p.m., Friday, 7 a.m. to midnight, Saturday, 9 a.m. to midnight and Sunday, 9 a.m. to 1 a.m.

USC is one of 24 private colleges and universities in California to join the One More Veteran Pledge, an initiative that aims to make higher education more accessible to veterans.
Through signing the pledge, the institutions vow to recognize veterans as assets to their educational communities and to take into account veterans’ service in the admissions process.
The pledge marks the first time since World War II that select private colleges and universities have made a concerted effort to recruit veterans. Historically, standard admission guidelines including high school GPA and standardized test scores have disadvantaged veterans in the admission process. By signing the pledge, the schools strive to admit one more veteran in the upcoming academic year than they did in the year prior.
All of the participating institutions, including the California Institute of Technology, Claremont McKenna College and Otis College of Art and Design, are recipients of the Ahmanson Veteran Scholarship Initiative. The scholarship provides funds to enroll, support and graduate more student veterans.
According to the statement, William Ahmanson, president of the Ahmanson Foundation, said the One More Veteran Pledge demonstrates that educational institutions value veterans’ presence both on campus and in the classroom. He hopes that the initiative will inspire a shift in admissions processes throughout the nation.
“College admissions should treat veterans like national assets, similar to prized athletic recruits,” Ahmanson said in a press release. “With prominent ads in the The New York Times, Internet, radio and social media during admissions season, we have an opportunity to raise awareness, lead by example and effect change.”

Tailgating will be prohibited on campus for this Thursday’s football game against the University of California, Berkeley, but Undergraduate Student Government, with the support of the administration, Athletic Department and the PAC-12, is hosting a tailgate for students in Exposition Park.
The tailgate will take place from 3 to 5:30 p.m. in Jessie Brewer Park within Exposition Park. It will be open to students, parents, faculty members and other fans. The tailgate will feature food vendors, inflatable obstacle courses and a beer garden for attendees that are over 21.
USG President Andrew Menard has taken the lead in planning the tailgate.
“We wanted to create this opportunity for students to have a place to go to have fun with their parents and have everything — for the most part — be free,” Menard said.
Restrictions to on-campus tailgating for Thursday night games went into effect last year. Tailgating was instead concentrated in other areas off-campus, particularly The Row.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry spoke about the issues the administration faced last year as a result of the Thursday night football game.
“A number of people came to The Row and started tailgating there,” Carry said. “It just became overcrowded. There were more people than The Row could handle. So when we met with the [Interfraternity Council] leadership right after the game, they indicated to us that they had no more options. They had no more places to send all of the guests that came that were expecting to tailgate on campus.”
On the night of last year’s Thursday game, several people were transported to the hospital due to excessive alcohol consumption, and a female student from Loyola Marymount University was seriously injured after falling off a platform at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. That weekend, later labeled the “worst weekend of the semester” by Student Affairs, has in part led to the new restrictions on tailgating.
The primary motivation behind the new restrictions, however, is the desire to preserve the academic integrity of the university, according to Carry.
“As an academic institution, it’s Thursday. It’s a class day, so we’re not going to surrender the campus to tailgating,” Carry said. “Our decision is first to respect the academic mission of the institution and to focus on classes.”
Carry also said there still will be opportunities for students to tailgate, just in a different way.
“Tailgating is available, but it’s just not available in front of classrooms and on campus,” he said.
Assistant Provost for Student Engagement Monique Allard has worked closely with student groups to plan the Thursday tailgate in Exposition Park.
“We’re really excited about putting on an activity that will be student-focused, so there will actually be something for students to do, in terms of tailgating,” Allard said.
Panhellenic Council President Katherine Grabar has helped lead the Greek community’s involvement in the planning of the tailgate and the implementation of new restrictions.
“Originally, PHC was going to be part of the Expo Park tailgate, but now most chapters have decided to forgo a Thursday night tailgate or dinner with the parents,” Grabar said. “Most chapters are instead, to kind of break bread with the parents, doing more of a Friday night open house and BBQ.”
Reactions to the new tailgating restrictions have been mixed, particularly due to the fact that the Thursday tailgate takes place during Trojan Family Weekend.
“I think, at first, it came as a huge shock because everyone thought, ‘Why would we pick Parents Weekend to do the tailgate?’ but then you look at the football schedule and holiday conflicts, and there wasn’t really a good Saturday game to do it,” Grabar said. “No one is pleased with it, but we’re moving on.”
USG leaders are hoping that the tailgate in Exposition Park will alleviate some of this discontent. Menard, though disappointed that students won’t be able to tailgate on campus, is trying to make the best of it.
“I understand why they’re restricting on campus [tailgating], but regardless, I’m appreciative of the fact that we have the opportunity to hold this tailgate off-campus,” Menard said.
Students can find more information about Thursday’s tailgate on the USC Trojans website.

On Nov. 17, the Dept. of Public Safety will launch the mobile safety application LiveSafe, which will allow students to report emergencies or send tips about safety hazards using text messages, photos and video.
Safety on the go · University officials hope the app’s four main features will encourage students to take precautions on and off campus. – Graphic courtesy of Jill Frater
 
It will be available for free download from the Apple App Store and Google Play.
“It turns your phone into a mobile blue light phone,” said DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle, referring to the emergency phones stationed at various locations throughout campus. “Even if nothing is said, we’ll be able to see the students location via a GPS component.”
In addition to allowing students to contact DPS, the app also includes a SafeWalk feature that allows students to input their destination so that friends can track each other on the map with the option to contact DPS if necessary.
“While we don’t want students walking alone off campus after dark, if you did, you could use the SafeWalk feature to tell your friends who are also on this application when you are leaving and how long you think it will take to get where you’re going,” Carlisle said. “Then they can track your progress and if you don’t arrive then they know something has happened and they can report that to DPS.”
The app also includes a campus map feature.
Monday through Thursday of next week, DPS will have LiveSafe booths on both the University Park and Health Science campuses. The department will be raffling off 20 iPod touches and OtterBox cases per day. If students show they have downloaded the app, they will also get a Krispy Kreme doughnut. Advertisements for the app will also appear on USC trams and buses starting next week.
DPS has been looking at investing in a mobile safety application for more than a year. Over the summer, a committee of members from DPS and Environmental Health & Safety reviewed proposals for several different mobile safety applications and met with nearly 25 vendors. But LiveSafe stood out because it was simple to use and is already being used in other universities nationwide, including Arizona State University, University of Cincinnati, Georgetown University and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
The app also has a unique backstory. One of its founders, Kristina Anderson, was a survivor of the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech that killed 32 people. Anderson was a sophomore at the time of the shooting.
“[Anderson] is a big advocate for campus safety,” said Jill Frater, business continuity specialist at USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning. “The other apps really didn’t have that personal touch behind it that this one does.”
Carlisle said it was also important that the app be customizable to USC. Upon first download, students will be asked to select the University of Southern California as their school. This will take them to the cardinal and gold version of the app that includes the USC seal and has DPS contact information preprogrammed.
Bill Regensburger, the director of Fire Safety and Emergency Planning, helped develop the customized version of the application and said he spoke with a number of student groups, including the Undergraduate Student Government, the Graduate Student Government and the International Student Assembly, seeking ideas about what would make the app useful and practical for students. Regensburger said that the ability to text rather than call DPS to report a tip or in case of emergency is important for improving safety.
“I’ve noticed that for this generation they would rather text something than make a phone call,” Regensburger said. “We should adapt to the way students operate best. We want to do all that we can to help keep students safe but it needs to involve the students too.”
Regensburger said that though the first version of the app is being rolled out on Nov. 17, students should expect updates with new features. He said students expressed interest in being able to use the app to know the estimated time it would take for a Campus Cruiser to get to their location, a feature that is currently being explored. Carlisle said DPS is also exploring the option of using the app as a source for Trojan Alerts.
Carlisle said the goal is to have 100 percent of students, faculty and staff using the app. and he hopes the majority of students will make use of it as time goes on.
Regensburger is adamant that as students use the app, they should continue to voice their concerns and ideas for improvements.
“I want students to give us suggestions,” Regensburger said. “The thing that students have told me is that we need to put things that are useful day-to-day into the app. We want to make it an app that’s all-in-one where students can get a lot of things done.”

USC held a Veterans Appreciation Day kickoff on Tuesday in front of Tommy Trojan to commemorate the men and women who serve and have served in the United States Armed Forces.
Remember the sacrifice · Michael Donley, 22nd secretary of the United States Air Force and a USC alumnus, speaks on campus Tuesday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The kickoff featured guest speaker and USC alumnus Michael Donley, the 22nd secretary of the United States Air Force; Michael Johnson, president of the USC Veterans Association; and Mark Todd, associate provost for academic affairs. The event was co-sponsored by the USC Veterans Association, Student Affairs and the Office of the Provost.
The event also included a yellow ribbon distribution, an information table from the USC Veterans Association, a flag signing hosted by the USC Helenes and a  tasting of “meals ready to eat,” a form of individual food rations served in the military. The kickoff began with a live performance by the Trojan Marching Band and a brief speech by Johnson, who spoke about Veterans Day’s origins.
“Veterans Day was originally called Armistice Day, and its intent was to celebrate the end of the hostilities experienced in World War I,” Johnson said. “But throughout the years, our country’s military was called to fight and serve on many more foreign soils across the globe and thus, a new title for Armistice Day was formed.”
Todd then discussed USC’s relationship and longstanding history with the U.S. Armed Forces and the programs created to aid active military personnel. Todd discussed various programs such as the Yellow Ribbon awards and the two flagship degree programs, which includes the Master of Military Social Work, a subconcentration within the Master of Social Work and the Master of Business for Veterans. Both translate skills learned in the military into the social work and business environments.
“USC has a long and proud history with the military dating back to World War I, where we served as a training school for army officers. In 1940, we formed our relationship with ROTC, bringing in the Navy, and today we have almost 900 veterans, benefits and eligible students at this university,” Todd said.
Todd concluded his brief address by introducing Donley. Donley, who served with high ranks in both the National Security Council and the Senate Armed Services Committee, began his higher education at USC where he earned both his bachelors and master’s degrees in international relations. His studies in Southern California began after he spent three years serving in the U.S. Army with the XVIIIth Airborne Corps and 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne). Donley began his speech by reflecting upon what he described as the life-changing effect the army had on him.
“My experience in the army, as it was for many of you who have served in the army, was life changing,” Donley said. “Through military service I came to appreciate the full range of individual tasks and teamwork required to accomplish a collective mission.”
He also mentioned that his fellow service members formed a diverse group.
“The military exposed us to a broad cross section of young Americans from all walks of life, and through the challenges and hardships of working in close quarters, learning inherently dangerous skills, occasionally fighting weather in the field or on deployments and often fighting the fog of military bureaucracy, we formed strong personal bonds in our units,” he said. “Most importantly, I quickly learned at the lowest level that the military is a team sport and everyone must play together to have a successful mission.
Donley further discussed how the politics of the Middle East, specifically during the time in which his unit was on alert for potential deployment during the October 1973 war between Egypt and Israel and, later, the 1974 Cyprus conflict between Greece and Turkey, sparked his desire to understand the nature of these conflicts.
Donley and Todd reiterated the importance of taking Veterans Day to celebrate over 20 million veterans, 2.5 million of whom have served since the 9/11 attacks.
Donley commented on the critical value of remembering the veterans from previous generations who established the concept of sacrifice for one’s country.
“It is important, occasionally, to look back on our shoulders and remember that we were not the first to do this. We don’t have to go that far to touch and reflect on the long line of veterans who’ve generation after generation put their lives in harm’s way, as many of you have done in the defense of our country,” Donley said.
Donley also commented on the consistent support the university has provided U.S. veterans. The university does so, according to Donley, by providing an optimal campus environment and creating a longstanding academic commitment to knowledge of military services.
Donley concluded his speech by discussing the missions that America’s veterans aim to carry out.
“Across the generations, wherever the fight, whatever the mission, the two-fold gift of America’s veterans has always been the same. That gift is to defend the nation and keep us safe from harm, and to provide the opportunity for those around you to fully partake in what Thomas Jefferson simply called, ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,’” Donley said.
Chris Fox, a first-year master’s student studying public administration and a seven-year veteran of the Air Force, said he was impressed with Donley’s service.
“I think it was fantastic to come out here. In fact, I didn’t know [Donley] was coming here until today. It was a great surprise … [Donley] is an inspirational speaker and we have a lot of respect for his service,” Fox said.

Eleven minutes.
That’s how close the women’s soccer team was to pulling off a minor miracle last Friday night.
The Women of Troy were facing off against crosstown rival UCLA and came into the match as heavy underdogs. USC is a relatively young team with a first-year head coach in Keidane McAlpine, and the Bruins came into the matchup as the undefeated defending national champions. It was the final game of the regular season, and with the football team on a bye week, the rivalry was played out in front of about 10,000 fans under the stadium lights of the Coliseum.
Just short · Sophomore Kayla Mills (18) and the women’s soccer team fell short in their upset bid of No. 1 UCLA last Friday night. USC’s women’s volleyball team will now try its hand at upsetting top-ranked Stanford tonight. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The Bruins controlled possession for most of the game and had numerous opportunities to break through, but the USC defense held tight for all of the first half and most of the second half. But the Women of Troy couldn’t hold on for a full 90 minutes as UCLA found the back of the net in the 79th minute. The Bruins added a second goal in the 87th minute to seal a 2-0 victory.
The defeat brings up some bad memories from other sporting events in the same venue this year. It also gives me somewhat of a bad feeling as the women’s volleyball team goes into a very similar challenge tonight against Stanford.
But I’ll stick by my assessment that fans should be proud, not disappointed, by the soccer team’s performance. Likewise, though my expectations might not be high, I absolutely plan on seeing the volleyball team play tonight in the Galen Center because the Women of Troy’s match is sure to be exciting regardless of the outcome.
If you didn’t see the soccer game Friday, you’ve probably seen at least one similar result on a Saturday. The USC football team has had two of those kinds of losses in conference play, first against Arizona State and then against Utah, where a Pac-12 rival just barely snuck past the Trojan defense to steal a victory at the end of the game. Not only was the soccer team’s result very similar to those of the football team, but the game plan and general style of play was as well.
The soccer team by all means played a very conservative game against UCLA. It seemed like the Women of Troy played the entire game with only one forward positioned relatively high on the field and five midfielders positioned relatively low alongside the four defenders. Almost every soccer team plays with four defenders, but teams will commonly play with two or three forwards instead of having so many players in the midfield.
Not only did USC drop nine of 10 field players into defense when the Bruins had the ball, but the Women of Troy looked equally cautious with the ball. McAlpine didn’t just concede that the Women of Troy weren’t going to score barring a major defensive blunder from UCLA, but it didn’t even look like USC was trying to keep possession. An old sports adage is that the best defense is a good offense, and maintaining possession for an extended period of time prevents an opponent from scoring during that time. But the Women of Troy thought the best strategy on defense was to “park the team bus in front of the goal,” as the saying goes in soccer, instead of trying to keep the ball away from the Bruins. Though the Bruin outside defenders were very involved on offense and pressed forward when UCLA had the ball, USC almost always kept all four defenders behind midfield. Instead of supporting the ballcarrier while USC had possession, the outside defenders helped protect against an uneven attack the other way.
Yes, it was frustrating seeing the game plan fail so close to the finish line. But as I’ve consistently said when looking at the football team, playing conservatively is not inherently flawed. There are reasons why teams do it, and there are situations as well as opponents in which it really makes sense.
The simplest and most accurate explanation for why the soccer team lost to UCLA is that UCLA was the better team. The Bruins were not only faster, but also better ball handlers. There’s very little the Women of Troy could have done against such a task.
If opponents have much more speed, it’s almost impossible to beat them with aggressive, quick-strike counterattacks — in fact, those just leave you vulnerable to their counterattacks in return. But if a team also has much better ball control, it’s very hard to keep possession for large chunks of time. Bringing outside defenders forward to support possession on offense just opens up the opportunity for more counterattacks. It’s obviously much easier to defend a team with nine defenders in a tight space than with just your two center defenders in an open field.
After watching the soccer game Friday, I’m particularly cautious about any optimism going into the women’s volleyball game today because it’s particularly hard to engineer an upset in that sport. Unlike in soccer, volleyball teams can’t just sit back and hopefully wait to capitalize on one big mistake. UCLA ultimately avoided any major errors, but one bad turnover midway through the second half could have been enough for USC to take the lead and change the dynamic of a game. In volleyball, you need more than one mistake and one point to steal a match. You need at least 25 points just to win one set, and it takes three sets to claim a match. One big point certainly can be the difference between a win and a loss in volleyball, but it can’t wash away an otherwise completely dominant performance like it can in soccer.
But I wouldn’t say the volleyball team is severely outmatched going into the Stanford matchup. Yes, the Cardinal are undefeated on the season and ranked as the No. 1 team in the country, but the Women of Troy actually took a set of Stanford in a 23-25, 25-22, 25-20, 25-19 defeat earlier this season in Palo Alto.
Despite the disappointing result at the Coliseum Friday, it was a tremendously exciting fan atmosphere to be a part of and totally worth the trip. Not only was the record-breaking turnout — mostly local youth soccer league players and their parents, along with a fair number of students — exciting to experience, but the game itself was fantastic. The Women of Troy didn’t have a ton of scoring chances but they fought valiantly with their backs against the wall all game. I left the Coliseum proud to call those student-athletes my classmates.
I’m equally excited about catching the volleyball game tonight. I’m hopeful for a classic upset, but there’s also something inherently awesome about watching USC athletes representing our school.
I won’t go as far as predicting an upset like I did before USC’s trip to Washington this year — the team lost to the Huskies in straight sets. But I urge anyone reading this to join me at 7:30 p.m. in the Galen Center.
Maybe all the Women of Troy need to engineer an upset is some good ole home-court advantage.

After a long road trip to Colorado and Utah that resulted in a win and a loss, the USC women’s volleyball team returns home to play the No. 1 team in the country in Stanford on Wednesday as well as Cal on Friday.
Elder Emily · Outside hitter Emily Young will be one of USC’s three seniors honored before the match against California on Friday. – Brian ji | Daily Trojan
During the road trip, then-No. 19 USC (14-10, 7-7 Pac-12) struggled against unranked Utah, eventually falling 17-25, 22-25, 24-26. The Women of Troy rebounded with a sweep of their own, defeating then-No. 21 Colorado 25-23, 27-25, 25-22.
Now USC has its toughest home test of the season against undefeated Stanford (24-0, 14-0), less than a month after a hard-fought battle between the two teams in Palo Alto, California. In that match, the Women of Troy lost in four sets but each set was extremely competitive.
Stanford runs a 5-1 offense with junior Madi Bugg as the only setter on the court. Bugg does an effective job of spreading the ball around to all of the Cardinal’s hitters, serving to balance the offense. Middle blocker Inky Ajanaku and junior outside hitter Jordan Burgess drive the team’s offense. Ajanaku is one of the nation’s best players, averaging 1.18 blocks per set and 3.54 kills per set.
USC junior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms and senior middle blocker Hannah Schraer will have the tough task of slowing down Ajanaku, but are confident in their abilities.
“Well I showed that I am capable of doing that,” Ogoms said. “[Ajanuaku] has been All-American for two years in a row. I just have to focus on what I can do more than what she will do.”
Burgess, on the other hand, has received 752 sets this season and is Stanford’s workhorse on the outside. She has a .269 hitting percentage and 277 kills on the season. The Women of Troy will have to serve Burgess tough in order to knock her off her game and play solid defense when she swings.
USC head coach Mick Haley knows that this will be a tough match for the team, especially with how strong Stanford is in all facets of the game.
“They have had the same lineup for three years and they are trying to be low error,” Haley said. “They also set the middle more than other teams. They set the middle 57 times against us last time.”
On Friday, USC finishes its last homestand of the season against the Cal Golden Bears, who are still looking for their first conference win. In the last seven meetings between the two teams, USC has won all seven and hope to improve to 8-0. This match will also be senior night for setter Hayley Crone and outside hitter Emily Young as well as Schraer.
The Golden Bears have struggled offensively, posting a hitting percentage of only .209. Though Cal has a tough time getting its offense going, the Women of Troy still have to be wary of senior outside hitter Christina Higgins and junior middle blocker Lillian Schonewise.
Higgins has been the Bears’ best hitter, with 349 kills overall and an average of 3.75 kills per set. Schonewise has been the more consistent offensive threat with a .322 hitting percentage.
The Women of Troy have to bring their A-game for both opponents, as they cannot afford another loss. They will continue to rely heavily on junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who has 367 kills, and sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu, who averages 3.07 kills per set.
“I can just help my team by playing good defense in order to score points,” Bricio said. “What I need to get better at is my serving. If I stop worrying about making an error serving, it will help our team a lot.”
To complement its offense, USC needs to control the net with a strong blocking presence. Schraer and Ogoms will have to wreak havoc up at the net in order to give the Women of Troy a chance at a Bay Area sweep.
There are only six matches left in the season, and the Women of Troy hope to improve their resume for the NCAA tournament in December. With only two wins against ranked opponents, Kentucky and Colorado, the Women of Troy hope to add Stanford to that list starting at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday.

The Trojan basketball team will start its season at home on Saturday as it hosts Portland State in the season opener. USC will be led by second-year head coach Andy Enfield, who welcomes a brand new group to start the year. USC only has eight returning players from last year’s squad, which finished last in the Pac-12 at 11-21 and 2-16 in conference play. The team lost its leading scorer and rebounder, Byron Wesley, who transferred to Gonzaga, and now welcomes six new players — four freshmen and two transfers. Of the team’s 14 players, there are no seniors, and the roster doesn’t feature a center. Eleven players are either freshmen or sophomores and the other three are juniors. Though the team is not all that experienced, the Trojans will look to lean on their talent to win games and compete every night.
Super Serbian · Sophomore Nikola Jovanovic, who hails from Belgrade, Serbia, will bolster USC’s men’s basketball team this year. The 6-foot-11 forward averaged 8.0 points and 4.4 rebounds while playing an average of 20.8 minutes per game in his debut campaign at USC last year. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
 
Leading the charge for the Trojans will be a pair of sophomores, captain Julian Jacobs and sharp-shooting big man Nikola Jovanovic. Both players saw a lot of time on the court as freshmen and will use those minutes to lead such a young team.
Jovanovic gained some extra experience over the summer as well when he played on the Pac-12 All-Star Team. The forward played a key role on this team that competed in China; he helped lead the team to a 3-0 record by leading the team in scoring and finishing second in rebounds. Jovanovic will use his experience gained in overseas play to help lead  such a young team.
“Out of all the players I’ve coached, he’s in an elite group of the right attitude and hardest working players,” Enfield said of Jovanovic.
Jovanovic said his time in China helped him improve his game.
“I was able to show my post moves,” Jovanovic said. “Going forward in the season, I knew I was going to be the tallest guy on my team. I was trying to be better in the post moves and also to be a more consistent shooter. I think I proved it well.”
Jovanovic averaged 8 points and 4.4 rebounds as a freshman for USC; he started 24 games and played in all 32.
The other prominent returner is Jacobs, a guard who figures to be the leader of this team. In the Trojans’ exhibition game against Cal State Los Angeles, Jacobs came off the bench and stopped the bleeding after a terrible start by the Trojans, who found themselves down by 13 early. Jacobs entered the game and scored seven unanswered points to energize his teammates and get the Trojans back in the game. Jacobs has been touted as the captain of this young team and whether he starts or continues to come off the bench, he will play key minutes and lead by example throughout the season.
“Leadership is by example in my eyes. Julian Jacobs is our captain right now,” Enfield said. “He played a lot of minutes as a freshman. You don’t need to be a junior or senior to provide leadership.”
Jacobs averaged 6.6 points and 4.4 rebounds as a freshman, when he started 19 games for the Trojans.
A lot of the attention coming into the season has been on the Trojans’ freshman class, which is ranked 16th overall by ESPN.com. This freshman class is headlined by point guard Jordan McLaughlin, who is ranked 41st by ESPN.com. McLaughlin is joined by guards Elijah Stewart and Malik Marquetti and forward Malik Martin.
“Jordan [McLaughlin] is a terrific student-athlete,” Enfield said. “We’re expecting big things from him. I think he came to USC for that opportunity, to be relied upon as a freshman. He’ll have that opportunity. We’re excited for him.”
McLaughlin will get the opportunity to lead the offense and show off his abilities that made him such a sought-after recruit. One of his main attributes is his ability to get to the rim, but he is also aware of the changes he has to make to his game now that he is in college.
“That’s a big adjustment that I have is just working on my floaters and different types of finishes at the rim,” McLaughlin said. “You can’t just lay it up at the rim when you’ve got a 6-foot-10 guy coming across to block your shot.”
Along with the four freshmen, USC also welcomes two new transfers to their roster this season. Redshirt sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt and redshirt sophomore forward Darion Clark do not have experience with the Trojans but both put up solid numbers with UNLV and Charlotte respectively in their freshman seasons. Reinhardt should be a staple in the starting lineup as he provides consistent shooting and toughness in the backcourt.
“[Reinhardt] shoots the ball at an extremely high level. He’s learning how to come off ball screens, put the ball on the floor,” Enfield said. “If he can keep that up, I think with Jordan [McLaughlin], Katin [Reinhardt], the other guys we have on our roster, we should have a pretty good backcourt.”
Though Reinhardt and Clark have yet to suit up for USC, they do bring in some experience through their 52 combined collegiate starts; 18 from Clark and 34 from Reinhardt. Clark should be a force off the bench for the Trojans; he averaged 6.2 points and 4.6 rebounds in 17.6 minutes per game as a freshman at Charlotte. Reinhardt  averaged 10.1 points and was second on the team with 86 assists. He also led UNLV with 65 three-pointers which helped the team to a 25-10 record and a spot in the NCAA Tournament.
“I was just learning, watching a lot of film, picking the coaches’ brains — just working on everything that I haven’t been able to work on,” Reinhardt said. “Finally having a year off to just work on my game and get better, just looking at all the little things I was doing wrong and trying to improve.”
Other returning members to this year’s squad include the three juniors, guards Chass Bryan and Brendyn Taylor and forward Strahinja Gavrilovic. A trio of sophomores makes up the rest of the team, guards Kahlil Dukes and Devon Pflueger and forward Samer Dhillon.
This team has a tall task ahead of it if it wants to improve upon its last place finish in the Pac-12 during the 2013-2014 campaign. Defense will play a key part in the Trojans’ quest for a competitive season, something that has already been preached to the players.
“Our three principles are active feet, active hands, active mouth,” McLaughlin said. “We just try to take that to the game and cause chaos.”
The team takes on quite the ambitious schedule with matchups against Utah State, New Mexico and Boston College. USC heads on the road early into the season when they compete in the Charleston Classic from Nov. 20-23. Throughout the season, the Trojans are scheduled to face a potential 11 games against teams that competed in the 2014 NCAA Tournament and an additional 10 games against teams that played in a postseason tournament.
“The Pac-12 is an excellent conference. Reloaded this year with some very good recruits around the league and actually in coaching,” Enfield said. “That’s what we’re here for. We brought in some young, talented players, guys like Nikola [Jovanovic], Julian Jacobs, who played a lot last year as freshmen. That’s what it’s all about: competing at the highest level. We need to take that as a challenge and elevate our program to where some of the other teams in the league are.”
The Trojans get to start off at home in the Galen Center on Saturday, Nov. 15 when they host Portland State. Portland State finished 17-15 last season and will return three starters to their lineup. USC won the only other meeting these two teams have ever had: 87-78 way back in 1978. Tip off for the season opener is at 7:30 p.m.

“Paper or plastic?”
For customers, the answer “plastic” is almost instinctive — after all, nearly 14 billion plastic bags are distributed annually in California alone. But following the recent passage of SB-270, which outlaws single-use plastic shopping bags statewide, consumers will soon face new options: bring their own bag or pay 10 cents for a paper one. The city of Los Angeles already adopted the ban this year. It was effective in large grocery stores and markets as of Jan. 1, and in smaller businesses as of July 1.
According to a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, six in 10 Californians support the statewide bag ban, and rightfully so — plastic bags have long been a menace to the environment, and this ban should be openly embraced as an easy solution.
The law takes effect for major grocery chains and pharmacies in July 2015 and will expand to convenience and liquor stores in July 2016. Under the law, stores must replace free plastic bags with recycled paper bags or bags made from compostable material, with a 10 cent fee for shoppers. Shoppers are also encouraged to bring their own reusable bags from home.
Nearly 13 percent of the municipal waste stream is comprised of plastics, including nonbiodegradable plastic bags — which frequently litter waterways, parks and sidewalks — and present a choking hazard to wildlife. The seemingly harmless grocery bags that many consumers use regularly actually have a considerable impact on the environment.
Considering these negative effects, it’s surprising that plastic bags weren’t eliminated years ago. Plastic bags are practically pointless and don’t have any special grocery-carrying powers; they serve the same function as any other bag in simply carrying goods. The only thing plastic bags can do that reusable bags can’t is cause excessive pollution.
Plastic bag pollution has an easily identifiable source — stores. In turn, it has an easily identifiable solution — stopping the distribution of these bags. SB-270 effectively shifts the focus to completely preventing the problem.
Some opponents claim that this outright ban isn’t fair to low-income shoppers, since alternative options involve either paying 10 cents per paper bag or purchasing reusable bags. These opponents, however, completely overlook the fact that the 10 cent paper bag charge will be waived for shoppers relying on the state’s food assistance program.
The readily available replacements to plastic bags are precisely what make the new legislation easy to put into practice. For other environmental issues, the time isn’t right for preventive legislation because there simply isn’t a viable replacement for the harmful product. For example, despite the significant contribution of vehicles to air pollution, the state couldn’t fairly ban gas-powered cars because there isn’t an affordable, highly available alternative yet. On the other hand, in the case of plastic bags, it’s a simpler transition: Shoppers still get bags from stores — they’re just no longer made out of plastic.
Considering the law’s clear benefits and easy implementation, it’s a wonder that 35 percent of voters still oppose the law. Much of this opposition stems from plastic bag companies themselves, who claim the ban will cause job losses. These opponents fail to realize that though the market for single-use, nonbiodegradable plastic bags will shrink, the demand for recycled plastic bags and reusable bags will grow.
In fact, lawmakers already accounted for the ban’s possible impact on the economy; the law allocates $2 million “for the purposes of providing loans for the creation and retention of jobs and economic activity in this state for the manufacture and recycling of plastic reusable grocery bags that use recycled content, including postconsumer recycled material.” The USC Dornsife/L.A. Times poll found that “Voters whose communities had already instituted plastic bag bans were more likely to support the statewide ban, with 69 percent in favor and 28 percent opposed.”
This suggests that residents who still oppose the ban might be doing so because they are not used to the new regulation. The plastic bag ban doesn’t ask much from California residents; it requires just a simple adjustment, a minor inconvenience, if that. Over time, residents will adjust, and the plastic bag will be nearly forgotten.
So why wait? As the first state to implement this ban, California has the opportunity to set an example for other states, sparking a national shift away from plastic bags. With the majority of residents supporting the bag ban, and the legislation set to take effect in just a few months anyway, Californians should obey the ban now, on their own accord. By embracing the bag ban, Californians can show that the ban is not just effective — it’s also popular. Until July, the “paper or plastic?” question served as a test of the plastic ban’s support. But now, “plastic” is not the correct answer.
Its a buy your own bag bill.  You can use the banned bag you just have to buy it by the box.  The other choice is a thicker plastic bag or paper.  The reusable bag comes with it’s own set of problems.  You have to use it at least 131 to equal the footprint of one plastic bag.  That doesn’t even include the energy used to wash it, most people don’t.
The profit in this is a lot.  That is who is supporting the ban.  They even keep the fee. Nothing goes to even pick up litter.
 The dorn poll is a joke.  Look it up, they didn’t poll that many people and the question was loaded. Not a good representation of all of California.
The only green part of this bill is in your wallet.
The ban is another erosion of freedom. There are negative unforseen consequences already coming to light in the cities with bans. Like, bacteria incubators that are reusable bags. This ban may be great for the environment and natural things like the spread of disease. 
Plastic garbage bags have a profit margin far north of 10% net. Plastic Grocery bags that are reused for trash at a rate of 83% have a profit margin around 1 to 3% net. The only bag companies that oppose the ban are those without trash can liner converting lines after the extruder. All others will make a windfall in profits. Just like what happened in Ireland. Plastic Bag production of all types measured by the lb. is up 70%. Who wins now? Both plastic bag types end up in the landfill. If all the reporters in the state had read a real Environmental Impact Statement before the “ban”, maybe life would not be tough on the working poor who need those “free” bags that cost less than 2 cents for stores to provide. The working poor do not qualify for free bags to Food Stamp customers. Now California has mandated Sweat Shop production of reusable bags and labor abuse. California has mandated maximum polluting paper bags as an alternate. Deforestation on a grand scale with massive land, air, and water pollution included. California has mandated windfall profits for Grocery stores that earn a higher margin on bag sales than anything else in the store. San Francisco has the most the experience with bag bans and their food poisoning levels have jumped dramatically. Reusable bags are just plain dirty after a few weeks of use. Plastic bags are sterilized in production. What about the other Internet Myths? Do responsible fact checking. Plastic bags don’t last 1,000’s of years. They don’t last 1,000’s of hours outside. Try it in your backyard. When was the last time you saw a free range Blue Walmart bag in the field. The color they used 18 months ago. They crumble to dust and microbes consume the result. Plastic bags are NOT toxic. FDA food safe and inert polyethylene plastic. Plastic bags are usually made of waste natural gas polymerized into plastic. I bicycle to town for all shopping and errands. I see a shopping bag as litter once every 3 to 4 months. They don’t register in the top 20 items from litter surveys. “Life Cycle Assessment of Supermarket Carrier Bags” – The latest EIS by the UK Environment Agency. It is a real EIS with no agenda.
So by banning plastic bags….all you folks have really done was increase people using garbage plastic bags for trash…..
yep

Between the million dollars in funding from donors and alumni and the high tuition rates, health services on campus are expected to be impressive. Reality, however, doesn’t reflect the standards. The care for mental health offered by counseling services in the Engemann Student Health Center is inadequate and ill-equipped to take care of students suffering from mental illness.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
This past week, the Health Sciences Education program hosted a poetry slam event, Slamming Down the Stigma, to raise awareness of the mental health issues on campus and to spread the idea that mental illness is not something to “be ashamed of.” At this event, students who have personally dealt with mental health issues or have loved ones that suffer from some form of mental illness were able to share their emotions and experiences through the art of poetry. Students brought up USC’s failure to serve those who need ongoing treatment for serious issues.
Though the current system is great for those who need to discuss problems they’re going through, a brief meet-up isn’t sufficient for those who desperately need help. USC does offer individual and group counseling, crisis and psychiatric services and outreach programs, but options for those who need long-term, care-intensive treatment on site are limited. For students who can’t drive themselves around the city to attend appointments off-campus, this lack of long-term treatment options is a real issue.
The need for mental health care in colleges complicates this problem. According to a survey by the American College Counseling Association, most students seek advice for post-adolescent trouble such as breakups and identity crises. What was alarming, though, was that 44 percent in counseling suffered from severe psychological disorders, an increase from 16 percent in 2000. Disorders include depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, alcohol abuse, attention disorders, self-injury and eating disorders.
Beyond the inadequacy of mental healthcare, the way in which Residential Education handles students that need mental health care has also been a disappointment.
Ariana Aboulafia, a junior majoring in political science and law, history and culture, believes resident assistants play a big role in the process. “I will say right off the bat that it’s a difficult position for both people involved. We enter college thinking an RA is someone we can trust, someone we can talk to as long as we’re not ‘harming ourselves or others,’” Aboulafia said.
Lauren Falahee, a former RA who graduated last year with a bachelor’s degree in biomedical engineering, stressed the nuanced role of RAs. “I really feel that there is a huge difference between the RA that residential education wants you to be, versus the RA that your residents need you to be,” Falahee said. “An RA should be a peer, not a superior, who is there to be a resource and guide for first-year students transitioning into USC. They should be someone you can confide in, because at the end of the day, they are just students.”
One student at the poetry slam, who wished to remain anonymous, discussed his own experience. He stood up and explained that when he opened up to his RA, he was reported to the supervisor, and DPS threatened to escort him to the counseling services if he did not go on his own. Yet, in reality, because of the failures of the mental health center, if he did end up needing long-term treatment, he would never be able to receive it at USC. The idea that a school that requires students to attend counseling sessions if they mention feelings of depression cannot actually give students real help or medication if necessary, is detestable.
Residential Education needs to be more aware of the delicate nature of students opening up about their mental health concerns and only force counseling upon those that admit to desiring self-harm or hurting others. Otherwise, students are shamed into therapy and will begin trying to avoid it because they felt pressured. The Health Center needs to improve itself by hiring permanent psychiatrists and therapists that could provide ongoing treatment and medication.
Though college students are legal adults entitled to privacy and autonomy, schools still hold some responsibility in overseeing their safety and well-being. Here at USC, it all comes down to whether or not the administrators care enough to give us a mental health center that ensure students’ mental stability.
