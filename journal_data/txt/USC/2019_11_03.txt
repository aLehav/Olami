The courtyard by the Kaufman School of Dance is a serene oasis amid the bustling USC campus — shady and secluded, a quiet spot where dance students can study together or rehearse their steps. But on Friday afternoon, the space was unexpectedly animated, as students and their parents trickled in and congregated around the perimeter. They were there for the Kaufman “MinEvent,” a 15-minute performance of excerpts from the works of Merce Cunningham.
A pioneer in American modern dance, Cunningham was a dancer and choreographer whose work was heavily informed by Dadaist, surrealist and existentialist motifs. Along with his partner, musician John Cage, Cunningham created almost 200 original pieces during his lifetime that pushed the boundaries of movement and expression. 
As Cunningham was born in 1919, this year marks his centennial celebration. The Kaufman school invited dancer and teacher Silas Riener, a former member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, to stage the MinEvent as a tribute to his enduring influence. 
“I was fortunate enough to dance in Merce’s work and experience his final creative works before he passed away,” Riener said. “He paved the way for a lot of different kinds of experimental work. He was always trying to think of something else, always continuing to make different choices.”
This unconventional sensibility seemed to inform Riener’s staging of the MinEvent as well. The piece was performed by freshmen and sophomores, many of whom had never encountered anything quite like Riener’s process. For one, all rehearsals had been conducted in total silence; the performance was the first time the dancers heard the music that the pieces were set to. 
“What was interesting … was that there was no music during the process,” Nina Gumbs, a sophomore majoring in dance who performed in the MinEvent, said. “Normally you’re going off of music, or the choreographer comes in, and she’s like, ‘You’re going to be in this spot, and this spot, and this is your cue.’ We didn’t have that kind of process.” 
Riener wanted the dancing and the music to remain separate so the students could focus on pure movement with no other distractions. 
“We rehearsed with a stopwatch to make sure things are the same length, but the music and the dance are separate and combined for the performances,” Riener said. “That’s been a really inspiring thing, to just really think of dance on its own terms.”
Additionally, many of the dancers were given autonomy to decide when and how they would execute the choreography. During one part of the show, dancers abruptly stopped dancing and walked offstage to stand to the side. The timing of when they decided to stop and where they would walk was up to them. 
“Some parts you could choose when you went to go and where you wanted to go too,” Gumbs said. “There were sections where some people might have been standing on that structure. I was actually out and around, behind by this box, that was a choice that I could make. So it was full of choices.”
Still, a large element of the event involved careful, thoughtful preparation. Though Cunningham is known for dressing his dancers in sleek, minimal unitards, for the MinEvent, the dancers sported casual street clothes — sweatpants, leggings, tank tops and T-shirts. Yet their outfit choices weren’t simply random; Riener wanted to ensure variation and diversity among the “costumes.” 
“Silas said … ‘Wear whatever you want. Nothing too baggy or anything, but I want you guys to look human,’” Gumbs said. “We all came in with different options. [Riener] wanted a mix of patterns, no patterns, shorts, dresses, everything.”  
The experimentalism and pared down aesthetics of modern dance was a novel experience for the dancers and audience members alike. Katherine Free, a junior majoring in international relations, attended the MinEvent and found the performance to be on the opposite end of the spectrum from her classical ballet training.  
“I normally go to more story ballet … performances,” Free said. “So to see a modern dance in an atmosphere like this where there’s not necessarily meaning, and you’re creating your own meaning between the sounds and the dancers and everything is really interesting.” 
And that’s exactly what Riener hoped for: That each audience member would have their own interpretation of the performance. 
“There’s no story or singular idea. There’s no thing that the dance is about,” Riener said. “People will all think different things. They’ll have an experience of moving bodies in time and space, and they’ll think whatever they think.”
Free added that she enjoyed watching the students learn and grow and be challenged by new, different forms of artistic expression.  
“I’ve seen some of these dancers before in previous performances,” Free said. “So to see them growing in different fields of dance, it’s really, really nice.”

“Oh my God Rowan, that’s so on-brand for you.”
If I had a dollar for every time I had this statement thrown at me, I’d be wealthy enough to take a vacation to Bali and live out my true wannabe influencer aspirations. All right, maybe not that much. But the point is that I’m told I’m “on-brand” quite often. 
My so-called “brand” is something I’ve found myself contemplating more frequently than ever. My brand — and, by extension, the elements that make up others’ brands as well — is composed of everything from the way I speak to the clothes I wear and the activities I participate in. Obviously, having external facets represent who you are isn’t a new development because everyone has a thing called a personality. The difference, though, with having a brand is it’s all about how you market your personality, particularly in the social media space. 
In the past, developing your personal brand has mostly come into play when it comes to internships and job hunting. In a professional scenario, it’s essential to communicate to your potential employer that you offer a specific skill set and personality that will benefit the company. Simply, your brand was equivalent to your tangible function within the workplace, and aside from that, you were just a normal human being.
It’s a fascinating idea, really, that we’ve now shifted to commonly referring to people and their everyday activities as being associated with their “brand.” Branding, by definition, involves presenting a specific, consistent image that attracts an audience and, ultimately, generates revenue. It’s a capitalistic structure that has trickled down from products to people — an exchange of personality for profit.
Don’t get me wrong — I ironically live for the brand, and I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t check my own Instagram and Twitter profiles multiple times during the day just to check in on how people may perceive me and what value comes from that perception. When I get dressed in the morning, it has to be about more than just getting dressed for the day’s activities (well, at least most of the time). When I post a photo on Instagram, I don’t just upload whatever is in my camera roll, instead opting for an extreme vetting process with extensive levels of sorting and editing. 
Basically, everything that has to do with how I present myself has an extra level of intentionality that plays into presenting this personified extension of myself. Narcissistic? Definitely. Problematic? Potentially.
Despite acknowledging that I know I buy into my own efforts at branding, I place a hard cap on how much I internalize this character I put on. People, at their core, cannot be simply defined by “brand” because people are people, not products, and humanity itself should not be reduced down to its market value.
Before social media, the average person wasn’t concerned with broadcasting themselves to an audience to be judged. With the proliferation of internet culture, however, many of us have now actively chosen to fit ourselves into particular tropes online that may not reflect who we are in real life. 
For example, take TikTok culture. The year’s hottest app that is to blame for so many viral trends in the greater digital sphere. On the platform, a few of its most dominant, infamous characters include VSCO girls and e-boys. Countless videos have been based on re-creating different iterations of these characters, and they’re fun to observe. 
Various TikTok influencers have achieved virality by dedicating their entire page to these trendy personas, often rendering the person and the character inseparable from the audience’s point of view. This audience watches these influencers throw around their scrunchies, eye rolls and catchphrases as if they were already natural parts of that person in the first place.
A closer look reveals that the central problem with living for these images is that it’s not possible to carry over these traits into real life. Face it: If you saw someone on the street exhibiting any of the characteristics native to their online personality, you’d cringe and maybe even comment that that individual’s perception of reality is skewed. Further, these digital tropes are often the product of materialism and editing, meaning that beneath their curated images, they’re just like every other person.
But maybe that’s the fun in it — allowing branding to be a means of escapism. Creating a brand allows you to pick up your phone and be someone else for a moment in the fleeting digital space while still being able to return back to your average, everyday life. Just keep this in mind: The true key to developing your brand is to make sure you know where your brand ends and the real person begins.

Martin Scorsese’s previous mobster epics — “Goodfellas,” “Casino,” “Mean Streets” —  all depict their characters in the prime of their gangster life. They enjoy bloody steak dinners at nightclubs with their mistresses and killing off wiseguys who said the wrong thing at the wrong time. The gangster life exalted power, wealth and kinship.
“The Irishman,” however, quickly subverts that approach. From its opening scene, we see a fragile, wheelchair-stricken Robert De Niro reminiscing on his life, already long past his mafia days. He’s been left all alone, reaching the end of his life with no one by his side. 
Scorcese isn’t just portraying the life of truck-driver-turned-hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) — he’s much more interested in how Sheeran reflects on his life, the mistakes, friendships and guilt that resulted from his time in the Mafia. What happens with all the guilt that has built up? What happens when everyone around you is gone, either by gruesome death or from active disacknowledgement? Were the successes in life worth all the bloodshed and family negligence? These are questions that linger in Sheeran’s mind as he nears the end. 
This film can also be seen as Scorsese dealing with his own mortality, asking the same questions of success, love, friendship and legacy. Nearing 80 years old, Scorsese strays away from the frantic, cocaine-induced pace seen in “Goodfellas” for an introspective look at aging and the legacy that a mobster leaves behind, one riddled with violence and betrayal.
Sheeran, a World War II veteran, begins his mobster career working for Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), leader of the Bufalino crime family in Philadelphia. Sheeran quickly becomes known as the man “who paints houses” with streaks of blood from the men he was ordered to kill. As he moves up in rank, he begins to work for Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), who heads the Teamsters, the largest union in the nation at the time, but thrives off his deep affiliations with the mafia. What starts off as working relationship between Sheeran and Hoffa quickly blossoms into a strong friendship.
The emotional crux of the film relies on Sheeran’s relationship with both Russell and Hoffa, men he respects greatly. The chemistry between Pacino, De Niro and Pesci is undeniable in this film; they capture a true sense of friendship and respect for one another. 
De Niro excels at bottling up all of his violent tendencies: One moment he’s cracking jokes and the next he’s cracking skulls. This is a man who does what he needs to do, plays it straight and doesn’t talk back. Pesci’s performance might be the most surprising, as he plays an intimidating yet tempered mafia boss. When you think of Pesci, you think of the loudmouth, short-fused, easily insulted characters he plays in “Goodfellas” and “Casino.” This performance requires that he stay reserved; he’s a man that understands that the hardest things in life require passivity. That’s just the way it works when you’re a gangster.
“The Irishman” may be one of Scorsese’s most contemplative films, but it still carries plenty moments of comedic relief, most of which come from Pacino. Relying on his usual boisterous yells and exaggerated hand gestures, Pacino manages to steal the movie as a short-tempered man who demands others show him respect and common courtesy — especially when it comes to being on time for meetings. 
Hoffa’s shouting and petty nature is juxtaposed against Sheeran’s tendency to be reserved and stand in the background as everything unfolds. While it may seem that they will not be able to stand each other, both begin to grow comfortable and voice their frustrations with each other. 
Friendships are forged, but friendships don’t last in this world. One night you could be out eating with your family, and the next thing you know, a pistol is pressed against your head. 
One clear distinction between Bufalino and Hoffa is their relationship with Sheeran’s daughter, Peggy (Anna Paquin). Russell, although reserved, still carries an intimidating presence. Meanwhile, Hoffa has a personality that is hard not to like. Understandably, Peggy gravitates toward Hoffa, who she sees as more of a father figure than her own. 
As the years go by and Peggy grows up (now played by Paquin), she remains disconnected from her father. His life has become solely centered around the mafia. His wife and kids are cast aside. She can’t even trust him to protect her because she knows just how far he will go to ensure her safety.
Although Peggy speaks only a few lines in the film, she may be the most important character for the themes that Scorsese is tackling. She observes and silently disapproves of what Sheeran is doing. Through her character, we sense that Frank is a man that has gone too far down a path of criminality and murder. Frank will never be able to reconcile the fact that he neglected his own family.
All these themes make “The Irishman” a wonderfully rich text; the film earns every second of its almost three-and-a-half-hour runtime with mesmerizing performances from three of the greatest actors of all time and impeccable, precise direction from arguably the greatest director of all time. Steve Zaillian (“Schindler’s List”) delivers a script that meshes comedic banter with honest discussions on loyalty, guilt and consequences.
Scorsese has delivered another masterpiece, one that is content with being mournful rather than celebratory. It is epic in scope, but personal in the themes it’s trying to relay. We will all meet our inevitable fates, but Scorsese asks us: How do we reckon with our mistakes as time continues to pass by?

Customers walking into Cookies N’ Kicks, located on the iconic Melrose Avenue, are greeted with a friendly and laid-back ambience. The shoe store, complete with music blasting and the sounds of basketballs bouncing, has attracted celebrity customers like Lil Yachty, Offset, and Lamar Odom. This L.A. staple was created by Eli Hayman, a student who took a leave of absence.
“Essentially what we do is, if you buy kicks, we give you cookies,” said Hayman, a former real estate development major. Last year, the 21-year-old decided to take a break from attending USC in order to pursue his business. 
Hayman created his first business called Wype the Hype, a sneaker cleaning service previously on Melrose Avenue, while at USC. Hayman said he rarely slept while balancing work and school — he would arrive at the storefront at 9 a.m. and leave around 5 a.m. After the success of Wype the Hype, he left school and launched Cookies N’ Kicks in 2019. 
“When this place came up, I approached my good friend at the time and my business partner,” Hayman said.  “I told him that I really thought this place would be killer for a sneaker store. It had a really nice look about it.”
Before his start as a business owner, Hayman was a sneaker seller, making a profit on social media and other online selling platforms. Hayman was inspired by the sneaker industry and the opportunity for profit that came with selling sneakers. While he plans to go into the field of real estate, Hayman said Cookies N’ Kicks fit into his current ambitions. 
“I don’t really do it for the money right now,” Hayman said.  “That’s not what’s important to me. The point is that we’re meeting every day, we’re meeting the coolest people and having the coolest opportunities.”
Hayman, who moved from Australia, has been living in Los Angeles for 16 years. While living in the city, he has become increasingly familiar with sneaker culture and the community of sneakerheads, who buy and trade shoes. He said he buys what genuinely catches his eye, rather than buying certain sneakers to follow trends.
“I have the most random Converse collection of like 80 pairs of Converse,” Hayman said.  “If I like it, I’ll buy it.”
Even though Melrose Avenue is heavily populated with sneaker stores, Hayman felt they were lacking in customer service. Part of his motivation for starting Cookies N’ Kicks was to create a friendlier environment focused on making the sneaker-buying experience more enjoyable for the customer. 
“Eli is the most persistent person I’ve ever met,” said Dominiq Sotelo, co-owner of Cookies N’ Kicks. “If he wants something, he goes out and gets it.”
The store features a basketball hoop, upstairs lounge area and an importance placed on providing a positive attitude. Currently, Cookies N’ Kicks has over 37,000 followers on Instagram.
“My experiences at Cookies N’ Kicks have always been amazing,” said Hrak Araradian, a sneaker reseller who runs 213 Solez. “I’ve bought and sold sneakers with them in the past, and Eli is genuinely super kind.”
Hayman works with different business partners involved with the store. He focuses on financial side of things, such as keeping track of payments and taxes, while each business partner has their own role in maintaining and growing the business. 
“I’m coming up with new and creative things that ultimately build the brand and make it worth more,” Hayman said. 
He is currently working with different influencers and designing merchandisers to promote the brand, as well as creating a cleaning product for the store with his experience from his first business.  
Even though Hayman said being a full-time student does not fit into his current lifestyle, Hayman wants to return in a few years and eventually get his degree. He said that his real estate classes were the most helpful part of his time at USC. 
His favorite class was Shaping Cities Through Real Estate, where he formed a close relationship with adjunct faculty Bret Nielsen. He would often look to Professor Nielsen for business and real estate advice, asking him about starting leases, and contracts.
“I plan to go back to USC,” Hayman said.  “I really would love to graduate.”
But Hayman said that he is just getting started. He hopes to use Cookies N’ Kicks as a launching pad for the rest of his career, making important connections and learning through experience.

When Gwen Howard, the director of accessibility affairs of Undergraduate Student Government, took office in April, she knew she wanted to create a community for students with disabilities to change the culture surrounding University accessibility. Howard, a senior majoring in performance (popular music), began working on USG’s newest student assembly, the Student Assembly for Accessibility.
Howard said she didn’t apply for accommodations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a condition that causes overly-flexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin, despite seeking outside treatment for an eating disorder her sophomore year.
“I didn’t really consider a mental illness that really was having a very intense impact on my life to be ‘bad enough,’” Howard said. “And that is something that I think needs to shift: this idea that disability is inherently tragic, disability is inherently sad, that it’s preferable to be ‘normal’ — whatever that means.”
According to Howard, the share of USC students registered with DSP is currently 6.7%, more than double the 3% registered in 2016, but still well below the national average of 12% to 15%. However, many students don’t think or are not aware that their disabilities merit accommodations.
Howard said she hopes having the assembly will increase awareness of commonly overlooked disabilities and the different types of accommodations students with those disabilities may require.
“What I think we need is to expand our sense of what disability needs are,” Howard said. “Rather than thinking of them as extra testing [and] academic accommodations, thinking about the full student experience and ways in which accessibility plays into every day of every student’s life here.”
Javin D’Souza, one of the assembly’s directors, said that while the assembly’s programming is still in the planning stage, the directors are hoping to host guest speaker series, inviting disability rights activists from the area to speak on campus. He said the assembly wants to develop programming that incorporates its members’ experiences.
D’Souza said one of the assembly’s goals is to connect students with disabilities and facilitate discussion at weekly meetings about the ways the student experience differs for those with disabilities.
“The sense of community is not there yet for students with disabilities,” D’Souza said. 
Howard said the assembly, which is still in the process of establishing an executive board, will present to the USG Senate Nov. 12. One week later, the Senate will vote on whether to give the assembly a trial semester. Pending approval, the Student Assembly for Accessibility will pilot in Spring 2020, and upon the trial’s conclusion, at the end of March, the Senate will vote to make it a permanent assembly.
Hailey Robertson, a USG senator and former director of accessibility affairs, said the assembly would expand accessibility advocacy to include more students.
“There are groups on campus to represent all different types of identities,” Robertson said. “That’s true for disability as well, but the unique thing is that there isn’t an umbrella organization to provide overlap that allows those different organizations to come together and connect, so it feels very isolated, decentralized [and] disconnected.”
Ben Rosenthal, former advocacy delegate and a USG senator working on the assembly resolution, said the assembly would work to develop resources for students with accessibility needs, including making buildings on campus more accessible.
Rosenthal also said the assembly would advocate for the inclusion of students with disabilities in campus clubs and activities. He said USG’s advocacy branch had already begun this process, working with USC Recreational Sports to expand the annual Swim with Mike wheelchair basketball tournament into a permanent sport. 
USC Recreational Sports rents wheelchairs for the event, but Rosenthal said the assembly would push to have the office purchase wheelchairs to start a league.
Howard said that while advocacy efforts have improved accessibility at the University, she hopes that having the assembly will encourage conversation about the social and cultural aspects of having a disability as well.
“It’s really hard to change the culture,” Howard said. “I’m really hoping that having an assembly will help to instill some of these conversations.”

USC’s 56-24 loss to No. 7 Oregon Saturday night at the Coliseum was a bad look for some of the program’s highest-profile members.
Let’s start with head coach Clay Helton, who can practically kiss his job goodbye. There has obviously been a lot of speculation about Helton’s job security in the last year or so, but his seat only got hotter in the days leading up to the game. The University’s hiring of Mike Bohn, the former Cincinnati athletic director who brought on former Ohio State defensive coordinator Luke Fickell as the school’s new head coach in 2017, suggests USC has keyed in on former Buckeyes head coach Urban Meyer as its future leading man.
The team’s performance Saturday night probably put the final nail in the coffin for Helton. After jumping out to a 10-0 lead in the first quarter, the Trojans fell apart and allowed Oregon to go on a 56-14 run the rest of the game. In a flashback to the 2018 season (and, let’s be real, most games this season), USC repeatedly shot itself in the foot with mental errors, from dumb conduct penalties to turnovers. The defense, which did so well to limit star senior quarterback Justin Herbert in the first quarter, had no answers once the Ducks got rolling, allowing Oregon to score on its final six legitimate offensive possessions.
The combination of the lack of discipline and the inability to respond to Oregon’s adjustments showed Helton’s unsolvable issues as a head coach. He has never been able to outthink the opposition or get his guys to play clean football. Saturday night was just the latest example, and I can’t imagine it gave Bohn a very good impression of Helton in Bohn’s first game after being hired.
Oregon freshman cornerback Mykael Wright’s 100-yard kickoff return touchdown just before halftime was a microcosm of the last few years under Helton. Senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. had just scored to make it 21-17 and gave USC a little bit of life. Instead of squibbing the kick with 20 seconds left, sophomore Alex Stadthaus kicked off, giving Wright the opportunity for a runback.
Helton said after the game that he had confidence in Stadthaus to kick it out of the back of the end zone. This is simply a lack of foresight; why even risk a return? It was a bad decision in the moment, and Helton’s comment did nothing to reduce its head-scratching nature.
The loss also had long-term implications that seal Helton’s fate. USC now sits a game behind No. 8 Utah in the Pac-12 South standings, and it seems unlikely the Trojans will get to make use of the tiebreaker they earned by beating the Utes earlier this season. Utah finishes the season home for UCLA, at Arizona and home for Colorado, and it seems unlikely the Utes will lose to any of the three worst teams in the conference. And that’s assuming USC wins out, which also seems doubtful after that performance.
Helton’s only chance of remaining head coach was to win the South and go to the Pac-12 Championship Game. Since that goal seems out of reach, it’s hard to see how Helton will end up back in cardinal and gold in 2020.
It was also a sobering game for freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis, who completed 32 of 57 passes for 264 yards, three touchdowns (one of which came in garbage time), three interceptions and added a lost fumble. Oregon scored a touchdown following each of his turnovers, including a pick-six by junior safety Brady Breeze to put the Ducks up two possessions in the second quarter.
Slovis’ performance wasn’t entirely his fault. He was forced to throw 57 times, a school record and a burden no freshman quarterback should have to carry. He was under pressure all night. 
USC did enter the games with a lot of injuries at running back, but offensive coordinator Graham Harrell deserves some blame for not conjuring an adjustment as he did by inserting sophomore wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown in the backfield. Harrell is another main character for USC that didn’t put himself in the best light.
However, Slovis’ struggles are scary to the many fans who had him pegged as the team’s clear answer at quarterback for the next three seasons. Whereat one point next year’s starter seemed decided, there is a hint of a question. Perhaps sophomore JT Daniels hasn’t started his last game at USC.
But in the end, it all comes back to Helton. He’s the one responsible for the whole team and the one who will definitely not be returning next year. Here’s an idea of the extent to which USC beat itself: At one point in the third quarter, the Ducks had 281 total yards and 42 points. That is not a typical yards-points balance. So much of Oregon’s scoring came because of USC mistakes, and at this point in Helton’s tenure, that is unacceptable.
All of Helton’s players say they love him and play hard for him, and I honestly do believe that. But what is that love worth if it doesn’t translate to wins? USC needs to find someone who will not only inspire devotion but also establish a culture of discipline and accountability. There needs to be a healthy fear among the players that they can’t screw up or there will be consequences, and Helton has proven time and again that he’s not that guy.
Is it Meyer? I hope not (I tend to not support people who covered up domestic abuse). I’m not sure who the coach will be, but I do know one thing: USC needs a fresh start.

The USC men’s basketball team opens its regular season Tuesday night as it begins the hunt for its first March Madness appearance since 2017. 
The roster looks dramatically different from last year’s after securing the No. 7 recruiting class in the nation, highlighted by five-star freshman forwards Isaiah Mobley and Onyeka Okongwu. Mobley was named to the watch list for the Malone Award, given to the top power forward in the nation. Those two are the fifth- and seventh-highest rated recruits, respectively, in USC’s history (not including 2020 center Evan Mobley, who is ranked No. 1 in his class). 
The Trojans have six freshmen that should make an impact from the get-go, including four-star small forward Max Agbonkpolo, three-star guards Kyle Sturdivant and Ethan Anderson and three star shooting guard and two-sport athlete Drake London once he finishes the football season. The freshmen scored 56 points in USC’s 72-68 preseason victory over Santa Clara, led by Okongwu’s 17. 
The success of this year’s squad will likely be predicated on the performance of its freshman. 
Head coach Andy Enfield added graduate transfer guard Daniel Utomi and redshirt senior guard Quinton Adlesh. Both will bring veteran leadership, physicality and shooting to the Trojans. 
“The two of them are really fun to watch,” Enfield said of Utomi and Adlesh in an interview with the Orange County Register. “We hope that they can grow quickly because we need both of them to contribute.”
Returning for this season are seniors guard Jonah Mathews and forward Nick Rakocevic, redshirt sophomore guard Charles O’Bannon Jr. and sophomore guard Elijah Weaver. 
Mathews, who was one of two players to start every game for the Trojans last season, was third in the team in scoring, putting up 12.6 points per game. 
Rakocevic was second in last year’s team in scoring with 14.7 points per game to go along with 9.3 rebounds. He is the sixth-leading returning scorer and second-leading rebounder in the Pac-12, and was named to the watch list for the Abdul-Jabbar award, given to the nation’s top centers.
O’Bannon is ready to make an impact after a broken left pinky finger limited him to just one game last season. Weaver, who started five games as a freshman and averaged 5.1 points per game, will provide shooting and ball handling. He scored 11 points in the exhibition against Villanova.
Despite having two players last season now in the NBA — first-round pick guard Kevin Porter Jr. and undrafted free agent forward Bennie Boatwright — the squad could only muster a disappointing 16-17 record overall and 8-10 in conference, leading to an eventual Pac-12 quarterfinal defeat at the hands of regular season champion Washington. This lack of translation from talent to on-court success has been a recent trend. 
The Pac-12 preseason media poll had the Trojans finishing fifth in the conference behind Oregon, Colorado, Washington and Arizona.
Oregon will be led by last year’s conference tournament MVP, senior guard Payton Pritchard, who has hit countless clutch shots over conference opponents throughout his career. He’ll be aided by the Ducks’ No. 4-ranked recruiting class. 
Although they’ll be without their top recruit, freshman center N’Faly Dante, for the first nine games of the season due to the NCAA missing his clearance date, five-star forward CJ Walker and four-star point guard Addison Patterson and forward Chandler Lawson will contribute early for the Ducks. 
The Buffaloes return their two top players in juniors guard McKinley Wright IV and guard/forward Tyler Bey, who was the winner of the Pac-12’s Most Improved Player of the Year Award and named All-Pac-12 Conference First Team last season. Although this year’s recruiting class ranked last in the Pac-12, the Buffaloes have plenty of experience and depth, and the team’s core is entering its third season together. 
Washington brought in two stud freshmen forwards in the front court — Jaden McDaniels, who has drawn comparisons to a young Kevin Durant, and Isaiah Stewart. Sophomore transfer forward and former Trojan J’Raan Brooks will sit this season due to NCAA eligibility rules, but sophomore transfer guard Quade Green was ruled eligible over the weekend. The Huskies lost their top player from last year, Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year Matisse Thybulle, to the first round of the NBA Draft.
Amid FBI investigations and allegations against head coach Sean Miller, the Arizona Wildcats were able to bring in yet another uber-talented class, with two of ESPN’s top 10 players in the country in freshmen guards Nico Mannion and Josh Green. After a couple of inconsistent and underwhelming seasons, the Wildcats need to get back on track or else more people will call for Miller’s firing. 
The Trojans are coming off their winningest four-year span in program history with 87 total victories. That said, a loss in the Round of 32 like 2017 isn’t exactly the golden standard for a team that has consistently been in the top 35 in recruiting — and has improved its incoming classes every year. 
Last season, the Trojans had the Pac-12’s highest team three-point percentage, the most assists per game and scored the third-most points per game. However, between a 2-8 record on the road and allowing the seventh-most points per game in the Pac-12, it will take much more consistency to contend this year.
Adding physicality, athleticism, versatile defenders and even more shooting is a great start, and if the team can gel and play unselfish basketball in order to reach its potential, the Trojans will have a chance in a crowded Pac-12. 
“Gritty and tough, that’s what we want to be labeled as. A team you don’t want to play against,” Mathews said in an interview with the Orange County Register. “There’s some teams that you don’t want to meet up with in the tournament or whatever, and we want that to be us.”
The Trojans will take on Florida A&M Tuesday at 8 p.m. to begin the regular season.

In October, Academy Award winner Geena Davis announced her partnership with Walt Disney Studios to implement the “GD-IQ: Spellcheck for Bias” software that her Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media created along with the Viterbi School of Engineering. Davis marketed the software as a way to ensure that scripts for TV and film had a complete representation of diverse characters with an emphasis on searching for gender bias. An article from The Hollywood Reporter on the issue says that the software can not only determine the number of diverse characters, but also how many lines the characters have, and even the “relative social status or positions of power assigned to the characters.” 
While this software may seem intriguing, it appears to provide producers and executives with an excuse to bypass hiring diverse writers and instead has them relying on software to be “woke” for them. USC and the Viterbi school should not allow their technology to be used to this end, as it appears to be more of a way to create token diversity as opposed to writers naturally telling diverse stories with diverse characters.
Coding is fallible, and programmers often code bias into their programs. Past Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism visiting faculty member Safiya Noble writes about this same topic in her book “Algorithms of Oppression.” Noble points to numerous instances of “human and machine errors … that demonstrate how racism and sexism are part of the architecture and language of technology.” 
Under Noble’s logic, it may be virtually impossible to make a perfectly objective software and therefore it would be ill-advised to trust it with  accurately identifying minority groups and determining which characters are “diverse” without bias. This also means that the system will inherently make bigoted assumptions based on a character’s race, gender or sexuality.
At her summit, Davis extolled the software as a solution for some of the diversity problems plaguing Hollywood today. However, the foundation on which the software is built appears to already be flawed. Davis’ comments that the system can single out minority groups would rely on reducing these minority groups to a set of characteristics for which the code could check. 
This process is essentialist in nature, as it relies on a set of checkboxes to determine if a character fits into a certain identity group. This program also sets up a large checklist, simply saying that having minority characters in your story without making a full allowance for their identity in the story. 
GD-IQ: Spellcheck for Bias also sets a dangerous precedent for screenwriting at large, as this software encourages the writing of minority characters just to make sure the program deems your script diverse enough. Simply slapping an identity on a character isn’t enough: The identity needs to be part of the character and integral to their positionality in the story. Culture is starting to move past simply showing minority characters on screen without making an effort to tell their unique stories, and this software’s use is a regression back to this time.
The software also discourages studios from reading and purchasing scripts written by writers from underrepresented communities. If the software works as advertised — by simply finding places for minority characters — studios should just hire minority writers for a “cultural punch-up.”  
Adele Lim, co-screenwriter for “Crazy Rich Asians,” left the movie’s sequel due to her white male co-writer receiving a much larger payment for writing the sequel. In an article from The Hollywood Reporter about the incident, Lim commented that people of color were often “hired to sprinkle culturally specific details on a screenplay, rather than credited with the substantive work of crafting the story.” Software like this will just make it easier for Hollywood to keep up this practice instead of valuing the work of writers of color equal to that of white writers. 
USC should not feel comfortable putting their name on something that represents both a regressive view of diversity and could allow for the continued marginalization of writers of color in Hollywood. The University should not let their technology be used in this manner, as it represents a step backward and not a step forward for representation in Hollywood. With President Carol Folt promising a new era of progress, USC and the Viterbi school should not be promoting software that fails to encourage progress in regards to minority representation.

The sky is forever a dingy gray. Asthmatics have to limit their time outside, and parents worry about their kids’ developing lungs. It seems smoke is forever in the air; it seems California is always on fire and it seems like we are out of time to be proactive about it.
The reason we see such massive destruction of homes and towns every time there’s a fire is because we weren’t proactive about it. City and regional planning departments, private developers and voting citizens all keep pushing their cities’ limits. Additionally, we keep moving into places that we shouldn’t be moving into.
Forest fires are a natural phenomenon. Fires can clear the way in a forest for new, young plants. But nowadays, the National Parks Service reports that nearly 85% of forest fires are anthropogenic — started because cigarette butts were left burning or campfires were left unattended. We aren’t learning from our mistakes in accidentally setting fires.
We also aren’t learning to prevent the harm fires bring. Something that seems to go unnoticed: Fires are burning through the same places. Santa Rosa was hit by the Tubbs fire in 2017. Today, the Kincade fire rages near that same area. Cities should reconsider where they are allowing people to build, in addition to building and zoning codes.
Like Farhad Manjoo, a columnist from The New York Times points out, the solution to preventing fire destruction is simple. We need to live more densely. If we made our cities’ cores more sustainable and able to support a greater number of people, there wouldn’t be a need to expand into areas where wildlife and vegetation are fire prone or high risk. 
But building density takes time, and it takes forethought that Southern California lacked at the start of the last century. Urban development was expensive. So suburbanization happened, bringing many other infrastructures that contributed to a cycle of sprawl  — a highway system, a dependency on cars, an excess of parking and infrastructure that could be used for homes. 
So we pushed further and further out into areas that are at risk of fires, and at the corners and edges of our suburbs, fires spark. One-fourth of Californians live in areas that are at “high risk” for wildfire, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Since we can’t go back in time to reconsider exactly where to situate our cities — and we can’t displace the high number of people who live in fire-prone zones — the next best thing is to start planning for density from here on out. We can educate those who live in risk areas, create the most sustainable urban infrastructures and be mindful of future expansion.
Los Angeles is taking small steps toward change, in ways that aren’t blatantly fire-fighting, but are mindful of those aforementioned goals. Its 35 community plans — all of which cover different sections of L.A. — are under revision, and safety and conservation are both top priorities of the revision process.
One specific change seems far-flung from preventing fires, but actually reconsiders land use in a way that allows for more density. The revised Downtown Community Plan, released by L.A. City Planning last week, eliminates parking minimums downtown. This means that developments no longer have mandatory off-street parking. 
In a city that has excess parking space, this is significant. In a study published by the Journal of the American Planning Association, there were an estimated 18.6 million parking spaces in L.A. County in 2010, which is 3.3 spaces for each of the 5.6 million vehicles in L.A. County. Though parking won’t be removed, new developments can do without excess parking spots. And that land can be used to build housing, retail, offices — spaces that densify a city and do not promote a car-centric culture.
This is just a little step that means much more for the future. Planning for density requires forethought. We had none, so now we need to start small. We need to learn from our mistakes and the ruin we’ve seen. We need to advocate for denser, human-oriented development. Most importantly,  we need to keep our communities safe from fires.
