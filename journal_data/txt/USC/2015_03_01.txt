In an effort to combat sexual assault on The Row, Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry expressed a willingness to reform university policy by allowing sororities to host social events in their own houses.
USC does not have policies prohibiting sororities from allowing alcohol in their houses or allowing men upstairs, but each chapter’s national office enforces these policies.
Though USC does not have the power to reform sororities’ policies, the university is not opposed to allowing sororities to host their own social events.
“I welcome all ideas to reduce incidents of sexual misconduct,” said Carry in an email to the Daily Trojan. “If women would feel safer hosting events in their own sorority houses, then I am supportive of their efforts to establish this as a regular practice. This decision is up to the sorority leadership.”
Panhellenic President Caroline Cannan said that the organization hopes to ensure better safety for its members while abiding by each individual chapter’s rules.
“Each sorority has national or international offices that have their own set of rules that each chapter must follow,” Panhellenic President Caroline Cannan wrote in a text message to the Daily Trojan. “We as a Panhellenic Council do our best to support these rules and we support the sororities in promoting the safety and well-being of their members.”
Julie Johnson, National Panhellenic Conference Committee Chair (the NPC governs the 26 national sorority chapters around the country) said each chapter individually chooses whether or not to allow alcohol on sorority property, and each one has decided against it, according to USA Today.
Johnson also told USA Today that the reason for ban on alcohol and events that will likely include alcohol, is mostly a legal issue since the majority of members are underage.
In a January NPC statement to the media, the organization said that by allowing sororities to throw these events that include alcohol, it would be an indirectly supporting underage drinking. The council argued that this risk would increase insurance premiums as well.
“NPC would find insurance companies would not support the effort to modify or change the stance that has been in place and worked for 50-plus years,” NPC said in the statement.
Other officials from the USC Panhellenic Council declined to comment or did not respond to inquiries because of USC chapter policy to not speak to the media. Also, the USC Office of Equity and Diversity did not respond to inquiries from the Daily Trojan.
Reforming Greek life to better protect sorority women from sexual assault has been a significant national issue in the media following the publication of a story about an alleged 2012 gang rape at a fraternity party at the University of Virginia that ran in Rolling Stone. The story eventually led to the temporary shutdown of the university’s Greek life.
Though the magazine later apologized for some misinformation included in its account, the NPC responded to the report by calling for the end of the social sorority ban at UVA as well as a call to action to reform campus culture.
“We seek to be involved in next steps moving forward to heal from these events and assist in education to help prevent sexual assault and protect our women,” NPC wrote in the December statement. “We must not be bystanders. Let our voices be heard and actions be noticed.”

Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article stated that the National Panhellenic Council has a policy against members speaking to the media. It is instead the USC Panhellenic Council that has this policy.
The article also stated that National Panhellenic Conference Committee Chair Julie Johnson asked individual chapters to”vote” on whether or not to have alcohol in the sorority houses. There is no vote, but rather it came to be through individual decisions made by the individual  chapters.
The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

A new poll conducted by the Los Angeles Times and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences revealed that California Attorney General Kamala Harris has an early lead in the U.S. Senate contest, garnering the support of 28 percent of individuals surveyed.
The poll also shows Harris having strong support from certain groups, such as residents of the Bay Area. Many strategists have analyzed that Harris’ seat is by no means certain, however, as she is an unknown candidate to more than 50 percent of voters and is mostly viewed unfavorably by Republican voters — 15 percent are in favor compared to 21 percent not in favor.
Other results show that 19 percent of voters chose Antonio Villaraigosa, 9 percent chose Fresno Mayor Ashley Swearengin, 6 percent chose Assemblyman Rocky Chavez (R-Oceanside), 6 percent chose former California Republican Party Chairman Tom Del Beccaro and 5 percent chose U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank). Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced on Tuesday he would not run for Sen. Boxer’s vacated Senate seat.
A majority of Californians is also optimistic about the future of state politics, with 45 percent expressing that the state is “on the right track,” as opposed to 39 percent who disagree. Gov. Jerry Brown also received his highest approval rating in the history of the Dornsife/L.A. Times poll, scoring the support of 64 percent of voters.
“In addition to asking about more specific policy issues, I get a broader sense of what Californians think about California and what they like about living here and what they don’t,” said Dan Schnur, executive director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics in an interview with the L.A. Times and Dornsife.
These results come amid a climate of pessimism for California residents. The polls show that 42 percent of Californians thought “the next generation of Californians would it have worse off than they did,” compared to 28 percent who thought California “would be a better place to live in the future” and 24 percent who thought California “will be the same for the next generation.”
“The most appealing aspects of California for most people who live here [are] not surprising,” Schnur said. “It’s the lifestyle, people talked about the weather, they talked about access to the coast and the beach, they talk about family and friends, they talked about cultural and demographic diversity. So what they liked most about California is what California represents to them on a personal basis.”
Only one in four people expressed desire to move, 69 percent of Californians now cite the climate as their favorite aspect of the state instead of employment and earnings potential (12 percent). Californians also cited as “poor” several key measures of quality of life, such as traffic (82 percent), affordable housing (78 percent), affordable college (66 percent), taxes (66 percent), government spending (65 percent) and income inequality (59 percent).
Cathleen Decker, politics editor for the L.A. Times, commented that the poll results revealed that Californians did not support regulations, but were optimistic for the positive opportunity the state brought.
“People were not really all that keen on regulations,” Decker said. “They saw regulations as getting in the way of a full economic recovery, but they remained optimistic when asked about whether the opportunities and the offerings … By almost 20 points, they felt that opportunities outweighed the downside.”
Moreover, when asked why they might relocate from the state, 31 percent articulated it to the cost of living, 20 percent said employment, 20 percent said government and politicians and 11 percent said the cost of owning a home.
However, the poll also highlighted some positive sentiments about lifestyle in the state, as 85 percent of Californians consider the culture and the arts to be “excellent or good,” 74 percent rated innovation as “excellent” or “good” and 77 percent appreciated the preservation of natural resources.
Schnur explained that individuals polled are concerned that the standard quality of living in California will decrease for their children.
“On the other hand, they are very concerned with what California is going to offer their children,” Schnur said. “Even Californians who decided it’s worth the aggravation in order to stay here, they are still not certain … they are very, very skeptical that their children are going to have as high a standard of living and have as quality an experience in the state as they’ve had.”
A majority of Californians is also optimistic about the future of state politics, with 45 percent expressing that the state is “on the right track,” as opposed to 39 percent of those who disagree.

A week after Jack Jablonski’s head crashed against the sides of the rink in a high school hockey game, doctors told him he would never walk again.
Three years later, after intense rehabilitation and adjusting to life in a wheelchair, the Minneapolis native joined USC’s freshman class in January thanks to a scholarship funded by USC’s Swim With Mike program.
Jablonski left behind a close-knit network of family, friends, and teammates in Minnesota to enroll at USC in January as a spring admit. He is currently on the planning committee for this year’s Swim With Mike event.
“Because of the money that’s been raised with these people, it makes it possible for [people who have had a serious illness or accident] to go to college,” said Jablonski who is majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. “It’s a life-changing foundation for people who have faced challenges in life they never expected would happen.”
Swim with Mike was founded at USC in 1981 after All-American swimmer Mike Nyeholt was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident. Ron Orr, his teammate and the assistant director of athletics at the time, started raising money for his medical expenses.
“[Mike] had told me that money was too much for them to take, so he said let’s help someone else,” Orr said. “I was working at the university fundraising and set up a scholarship to help somebody else out.”
The event raised $58,000 in its first year, and to date, the foundation has raised more than $15 million. Sixteen students currently attend USC on the full, $400,000 scholarship, and recipients who choose to remain closer to home can still benefit from a partial scholarship elsewhere.
“The organization’s success is a testament to the Trojan family,” Orr said. “I think people care about us and when they hear of someone in need who can benefit from a USC education, they want to help.”
The opportunity first came for Jablonski through Nyeholt’s sister-in-law, Maureen, who works for the Anaheim Ducks in Minneapolis and believed he would be a good candidate for the program started in honor of her relative.
Players from the National Hockey League team came to him in his hospital room to tell him about the scholarship, and Jablonski and his dad flew in for an official visit last year.
“We have medical expenses other people don’t have to deal with,” Jablonski said. “The scholarship allows us to be able to go to such a prestigious college as USC and other colleges across the nation.”
Jablonski plans to pursue a career in radio and television. Back home, he hosted a weekly one-hour segment of a three-hour radio show entitled “Hockey In Minnesota” and hopes to use Annenberg’s broadcasting facilities while at USC.
“It’s amazing all the opportunities at USC they open for us,” Jablonski said. “I feel like I’m allowed to live as normal a life as possible. I knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”
“Jack’s a perfect example of why the program works,” Orr said. “The courage to come across the country is hard for any kid, but he did it. When recipients do that, they grow so much self-esteem in addition to education. Living independently is really part of the recovery.”
Jablonski said the most challenging part of his transition to college has been adjusting to life on his own.
“It’s hard being in a wheelchair, being someone who isn’t necessarily the person people want to approach automatically,” Jablonski said. “Beyond that, it’s getting used to the independence and not having the support I had at home. But overall, I’m very satisfied.”
Jen Lopes, a member of the planning committee, said she grew up attending Swim With Mike events with her family,
“Once I started working with the program and meeting the recipients, I was hooked on their incredible stories,” she said. “You really realize the things we take for granted and so meeting them has been the reason I’ve stayed a part of it.”
The 35th Annual Swim With Mike event will be held on April 11 at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
“We’re all fortunate to be a part of Swim With Mike,” Jablonski said. “If it weren’t for them, a lot of us wouldn’t be in college today.”

In its final home game of the season, the USC men’s basketball team was able to come away with a 70-55 win over an undermanned Washington Huskies squad.
The Trojans (11-18, 3-14          Pac-12) raced out of the gate en route to an early 14-2 lead. The Huskies (15-13, 4-12), who were without leading scorer and Pac-12 assist leader Nigel  Williams-Goss, missed their first nine shots.
However, the Huskies, led by guards Andrew Andrews and Quevyn Winters, would go on a 20-7 run over a nine-minute period to take the lead 22-21. USC responded with its own 6-0 run to end the half while keeping the Huskies scoreless in the final four minutes.
Sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic paced an 18-7 Trojan run to start the second half. Jovanovic, who had been in a slump as of late, scored the first 8 points for the Trojans, capped off by a massive dunk. Jovanovic would finish with 16 points, seven rebounds, and one block.
“Nikola was aggressive and he rebounded the ball,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “When we got him the ball in the post he was able to finish. That’s as well as he’s played in a while.”
The Huskies tried to battle back but never got within single digits of the Trojans. Andrews and Winters combined for 35 points, including eight 3-pointers. The rest of the Huskies would contribute only 20 points while shooting a mere 29 percent from the field.
With point guard Jordan McLaughlin out for the season with a shoulder injury, fellow freshman guard Elijah Stewart has continued to impress. Stewart contributed 14 points, on 55 percent shooting, nine rebounds, two steals and two blocks. He’s now averaging 10 points, four rebounds, two steals and 2.4 blocks over his last five games.
The Trojans snapped their three-game losing streak and have now won one more Pac-12 game than last season. While the Trojans are only marginally better on paper compared to last season, the team has made great strides throughout the season.
“We all like each other and playing with each other,” sophomore guard Julian Jacobs said. “That wasn’t the case last year.”
Jacobs, a holdover from last year’s squad, has thrived since taking over point guard duties for the injured McLaughlin. The sophomore had his best game as a Trojan on Saturday night, flirting with a triple-double — 8 points, nine assists, and 10 rebounds.
The win was much needed for both the team and the Trojan faithful who have showed up this season. Jacobs hopes the win shows how much promise this young team has for years to come.
“We basically just wanted to give them [the audience] something to look forward to next season,” Jacobs said.
The final home game is usually meant to honor the senior members of a team. This season, however, USC doesn’t have a single senior on its squad. The Trojans field one of the youngest teams in Division I and start three freshmen. Their youth and inexperience has cost them throughout the season as they have dropped numerous close games in the final minutes. Youth, however, means there is room for improvement.
The Trojans will have a chance to climb out of last place when they take on crosstown rival UCLA this Wednesday at 6 p.m. With a win and a pair of Washington losses, the Trojans would finish tied for last but above the Huskies due to their head-to-head record.
A win over UCLA would also give USC their first road victory in conference play.

For the past seven years, KXSC Fest has been drawing crowds from the USC and greater L.A. community with the promise of great music, fine food and a collection of interactive art installations, and this year was no exception. In spite of the rain Saturday evening, the event hosted by USC’s independent student radio station, KXSC, was able to move the stage and performances from their location in Founders Park to Bovard Auditorium.
Though there was general disappointment among KXSC staff members and volunteers who had wished the event could be held outside, as originally planned, they were able to create “a sold-out-show vibe” within the provided venue space and a thriving festival environment outside the auditorium.
“It’s been a crazy Thursday and Friday. We’ve been hard at work all day, contacting every organization that we reached out to and changing every part of the logistics basically,” said KXSC Head of Operations Chris Robinson of replanning the festival in less than a day.
In past years, the station has had to navigate challenges with fundraising and cost increases because of reforms in security regulations on campus. Luckily, fundraising and planning, which began this past November, went more smoothly for KXSC staff and volunteers detracting pressure from the sudden shift in plans.
“Last year we weren’t able to get funding from USG, but this year they [gave us the full amount of funding possible at $4,300],” KXSC General Manager Paige Schwimer said during the set up for Saturday night’s event.
The $5,000 raised through the university was accomplished with the use of Ignite USC, the university’s new crowdfunding platform that was unveiled as a kind of “Kickstarter for Trojans” earlier this fall. Additional funding was brought in by Alex Zhang, KXSC’s head of sponsorship, and Kinsey Thompson, KXSC’s sales manager, and with the help of their sponsorships team, they were able to raise roughly $12,000 from sponsorships alone. The money generated for the event went toward a variety of costs, including creating the general ambience surrounding KSXC Fest.
Zhang said one of the station’s main goals was to design a conducive environment where students are welcome to explore and meet new people.
“One of the biggest things, in comparison with other events that typically go on here — Conquest, Springfest — a lot of these other USC board events haven’t been able to capture that festival-like experience, which is really about bringing different people from all different walks of life into one shared space of music, culture and art,” Zhang said.
The “Digital Detox Lounge”, inspired by the device-free “Disconnect to Reconnect” spot at Outside Lands music festival in San Francisco was an added space this year where students were encouraged to engage one another without their phones.
“You’re so used to using technology and becoming reliant on it, and the moment they take it away from you, you feel naked at first, but that shared vulnerability kind of helps you meet new people,” Zhang said of the bean bag chair-filled lounge area adorned with DIY CD decorations.
USC organizations such as Corpus Callosum, a group that encourages collaboration between artists and engineers, and the Altar Collective, a small, student-run press based in L.A., also contributed to the festival-like experience with featured art installations and a small stage outside the auditorium for poetry readings and acoustic music.
Another major difference between KXSC Fest and other concerts held on campus is the importance placed on finding an eclectic group of up-and-coming artists.
“We have something for everybody,” Schwimer said. “As opposed to some of the other events on campus where they just have like one artist, one or two artists, and it’s always something really mainstream.  We try to give everybody a chance including student bands and local L.A. talent.”
Previous headliners have included STRFKR and Flying Lotus, who then went on to blow up via social media and music blogs. This year’s performers ranged from headlining electro-house duo DJ Dodger Stadium to dark-pop supporting acts like Muna.
Nationwide, college radio stations are being forced to abandon their cultural integrity, selling out their airwaves to simulcasts or having to shut down all together; KXSC, however, continues to weather the storm, overcoming the obstacles thrown its way and pulling off another great celebration for music, art and culture.

The USC track and field team enjoyed a rather thunderous close to the month of February this weekend. Members of the program competed in Seattle at the MPSF Indoor Track and Field Championships and in Claremont, California, for the 19th Rossi Relays, which marked the opening of the outdoor season.
In Seattle, the No. 23-ranked men’s team was participating in the MPSF conference championships for the first time, while the No. 12-ranked women’s team entered their second such conference championship after competing for the first time last season. Despite never having competed in the conference before, the Women of Troy took home the title last season after scoring 106, more than any team — women’s or men’s — that competed. This weekend, the team looked to defend that title and repeat as champions.
Backed by an impressive performance from freshman Dior Hall and a 4x400m relay win in which USC won with a meet record time, the Women of Troy did just that and repeated as champions. Hall won the 60m HH with a time of 8.11, with senior Melia Cox finishing fourth with a time of 8.34 to earn the team 15 points in the opening stages of the competition.
The women then netted 18 points in the 60m team competition race after redshirt junior Tynia Gaither, freshman Deanna Hill, junior Alexis Faulknor, and sophomore Destinee Brown finished 3-6, in that order, separated by just .17 seconds total between them.
The Women of Troy then made their strongest push of the competition in the 400m race, with their competitors finishing 2-5 and collecting 23 points behind four personal records. Junior Jaide Stepter finished second overall with a time of 52.89, freshman Kendall Ellis took third with a 52.19, senior Vanessa Jones finished fourth with a 53.33, and sophomore Amalie Iuel finished fifth with a time of 53.38.
Later, Faulknor won the women’s long jump, Hill won the women’s 200m, and despite already having clinched the title, the 4×400 relay team set a meet record with a time of 3:33.58 to put the icing on a back-to-back championship cake for the Women of Troy. They finished with 111 total points, thoroughly outscoring second-place finisher Oregon, who had 89, and ASU, who tallied 69.33.
The men had a strong showing in Seattle as well, finishing second in their first MPSF conference championship appearance. Junior Andre De Grasse won the 60m dash with a time of 6.602, winning by just .005 seconds over a fellow Trojan teammate in senior BeeJay Lee (6.607). The pair earned the men’s team 18 points for their efforts.
Lee would go on to win the men’s 200m, and strong efforts from teammates such as redshirt senior Connor McCullough, who won the men’s weight throw, freshman Ricky Morgan, who missed the men’s 400m title by just .02 seconds, and the combination of senior Michael Krone and freshman Randall Cunningham — who placed second and tied for third — in the men’s high jump all helped the men earn 88.5 points, second to only Oregon’s title-winning 95. A third place finish by freshman Marquis Morris in the men’s 60m high hurdles with a time of 7.95 and a second-place place finish by the men’s 4x400m relay team, which consisted of Morgan, junior Just’N Thymes, freshman football sensation Adoree’ Jackson, and senior Davonte Stewart. Their season-best time of 3:08.74 helped the Trojans immensely.
At the Rossi Relays in California, USC put on a strong showing as well. Senior Alexandra Collatz won both the women’s discus (175-11, or 53.62 m) and hammer throw (183-7, or 55.62m) events, redshirt junior Malia Cravens finished third in the women’s high jump with a clearance of 5-1.75 (1.57m), and 3000m distance runners senior Kira Soderstrom (a PR of 9:59.69), junior Katerina Berdousi (10:13.45), freshman Amber Bragdon (10:29.89), and junior Jenna Tong (10:33.58) finished 5-8, all helping the Women of Troy to a strong showing in their outdoor opening.
For the men, senior Bryan Mercado won the men’s 100m dash with a time of 10.72, freshman Dominic Smallwood won the men’s long jump with a leap of 23-2.00/7.06m, and redshirt junior Jovante Slater placed second behind Mercado and Smallwood in these events with a 100m dash time of 10.79 and long jump of 22-5.00/6.83m to help the Trojan men also put on a good display over the weekend.
Both the men’s and women’s teams have their eyes on the NCAA Indoor Championships that will be held on March 13-14 in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

A week and a half after they were defeated in the final of the ITA National Team Indoor Championships, the USC men’s tennis team returned to Marks Stadium to take on the Stanford Cardinal and the Tulsa Golden Hurricane. On Friday, the Trojans routed their conference rival Stanford, 6-1. The Trojans were stunned on Saturday, however, as they were beaten in a heartbreaking 4-3 loss to the Golden Hurricane.
The Trojans allowed the lone point in their Friday matchup against the Cardinal at the beginning of the match. Despite head coach Peter Smith saying that his team had worked on doubles during their time off, the team’s trouble in doubles play continued against Stanford. The Cardinal’s John Morrissey and Robert Stineman struck first in doubles play, beating senior duo Yannick Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz by a score of 6-3. The Cardinal clinched doubles play when Nolan Paige and David Wilczynski took down sophomore Nick Crystal and senior Jonny Wang with a 7-5 win. Junior Max de Vroome and senior Eric Johnson were ahead of Stanford’s Tom Fawcett and Maciek Romanowicz pairing 5-4 before play was suspended.
Singles play was a much different story for the Trojans as they went a perfect 6-0. In four of the six singles matches, the Trojans didn’t give up a set to the Cardinal. Johnson gave USC its first point of the day when he beat Wilczynski by a score of 6-3, 6-1. Next, Crystal gave the Trojans a 2-1 lead when he reigned victorious in a 6-1, 6-3 win over David Hsu. Then, Hanfmann increased the Trojan lead to 3-1 with his 6-4, 6-4 victory over Fawcett.  After that, Quiroz clinched the match for the Trojans with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat over Morrissey. The Trojans and Cardinal finished the remaining two matches, with the Trojans taking both of them. De Vroome gave the Trojans their fifth point in a three-set victory over Paige. De Vroome lost the first set in a tiebreaker, but dominated the second and third sets, winning both of them 6-1. Wang capped off the day for the Trojans, defeating Romanowicz 3-6, 6-4, 1-0 (10-6) to give the Trojans a 6-1 victory over their Pac-12 rival.
The Trojans followed up their performance on Friday with a strong start to their Saturday match-up against the Golden Hurricane. The Trojans controlled doubles play, needing only two matches to clinch the doubles point. Freshmen Tanner Smith and Thibault Forget were the first pairing to claim a victory in doubles play with an impressive 6-0 victory over the Golden Hurricane pairing of Or Ram-Harel and Juan Matias Gonzalez. A short time later, Hanfmann and Wang defeated Dylan McCloskey and Matthew Kirby 6-1 to earn the doubles point for the Trojans. Johnson and Quiroz were up 4-2 on Carlos Bautista and Alejandro Espejo before play was suspended.
Singles play was where the Trojans really struggled in the match. Ram-Harel put his Golden Hurricane team on the board with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Hanfmann. Next, Wang gave the Trojans a 2-1 lead, defeating Kirby in a 7-5, 6-0 victory. After that, Espejo tied things at two games apiece when he beat Quiroz 6-4, 7-6 (0). Then, Dylan McCloskey put the Golden Hurricane on top 3-2, defeating sophomore Connor Farren in a tight three-set battle that finished 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6). Next, Mitchell Pritchard took down sophomore Rob Bellamy 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (5) to give the Golden Hurricane its fourth point, sealing the upset over the Trojans. De Vroome and Bautista finished out their match, with de Vroome coming out victorious with a 7-5, 5-7, 6-5 (4) win, but the damage was already done.
Following the match, members of the Trojans team didn’t have many comments regarding their defeat. Smith said he didn’t think the loss could be attributed to one factor, but believed Tulsa had taken advantage of their chance to win.
“They played good,” Smith said. “They had an opportunity today and they seized it and they took it. And that’s sports.”
Wang summed up the day in an even shorter answer.
“They came out to compete,” Wang said. “They out-competed us today.”
One of the matches that could have made a difference between a win and a loss for the Trojans was Bellamy’s matchup against Pritchard. Bellamy was looking in good shape in the second set before Pritchard made a strong comeback to win the second set and ultimately win via a tiebreaker in the third set.
“I lost my competitive spirit at the end,” Bellamy said. “I made one error in the beginning of the 5-4 game and my energy just dropped. [It] dropped for the rest of the set [and I] couldn’t get it back.”
The Trojans will be in action again on March 5, when the team begins its play in the Pacific Coast Doubles Championships. The team will also have a road game against San Diego on March 5.

Year two of the Andy Enfield era will come to a close soon. Barring an unlikely upset of UCLA at Pauley Pavilion or an unexpected run through the Pac-12 conference tournament, the Trojans will finish the season with a 3-15 record in conference play and 11 wins overall.
In terms of a win-loss record, this year marks a slight increase from last season’s 2-16 march through conference play. Unless the Trojans are able to pull off a first-round upset in the Pac-12 tournament, they will match the overall win total of last year’s squad with 11 total victories.
As frustrating as the record might be, there are some subtle indications of a program on the rise. Last season, the Trojans were blown out of the majority of conference games, losing by double-digits in more than half of their matchups. This season the team kept it closer, with six conference games being decided in the final few minutes. Unfortunately, the Trojans were on the losing end of all of these games, which is why the record only reflects a marginal improvement.
Ultimately, though, it’s not good enough to just be close. College basketball isn’t horseshoes, and winning matters. As the great coach Bill Parcells says, “You are what your record says you are.”
For the second-straight season, that makes the Trojan basketball team a fixture as a basement dweller. It would be inane to put the team’s dismal performance the last two seasons solely on Enfield. The second-year coach entered a bleak situation, coming into a program absolutely devoid of talent.
He has made a few quality moves to rectify the situation, bringing in a respectable freshman class this past season. In addition to highly touted recruit Jordan McLaughlin, Enfield was able to nab Elijah Stewart who was the 2014 LA City Section Player of the Year for Westchester. Next year, local ESPN top-100 prospects Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu will headline another solid recruiting class.
Both McLaughlin and Stewart have shown flashes of their potential during the season, turning in a few excellent performances throughout the year. Additionally, freshman Malik Marquetti has turned into one of the best defenders on this year’s team. So there are certainly some positives when evaluating the team and the future of the program.
It would be impetuous to call for Enfield’s job after only two seasons, as next year will be the true indicator of whether or not he is the right man to be at the helm of the Trojan program. There are many areas where the Trojans can improve in order to really field a competitive basketball team in a power conference.
USC needs another point guard to complement McLaughlin. Though he had a decent showing as a freshman, McLaughlin’s nagging shoulder issues that originated in high school are cause for concern. Offseason surgery might fix that issue, but it doesn’t address the bigger problem. The bulk of McLaughlin’s game is centered on driving through the lane; there is a high probability that constantly exposing his slight frame will always put him at a risk for injury.
Furthermore, a point guard should be one of the best free-throw shooters on the team. McLaughlin cost the team repeatedly with an inability to shoot a high percentage from the line. Instead of relying on a platoon of Julian Jacobs, Katin Reinhardt and company to bring up the ball when McLaughlin is out next season, the team should be looking for a point guard to add to the 2015 recruiting class.
In Enfield’s up-tempo system, athleticism and outside shooting prowess are of paramount importance. The Trojans were certainly athletic this season, but they were inept from outside the arc. Arguably the best shooter on the team, Kahlil Dukes, rarely sees the floor. The only other consistent outside threat was Reinhardt, who fluctuated between outstanding performances and turning invisible on the court.
What USC really needs is a few players who can knock down an open 3-point shot consistently. It doesn’t matter how athletic all five guys are if every team packs it in with a zone because they aren’t the least bit concerned about the 3-point shot.
The team showed promise this season, and hopefully they can build on that moving forward. The Trojans have a few key pieces, and with the right recruits and improved player development, they can move forward in the rebuilding process. Next year will answer a lot of questions.

The No. 14-ranked Women of Troy closed out the 2015 Pac-12 Women’s Swimming and Diving Championships at the Weyerhauser King County Aquatic Center in Federal Way, Washington with a third- place team finish and three individual titles.
After the first day of competition, USC was fourth. The Women of Troy were able to improve to third overall, where they remained through the conclusion of the meet. USC finished third with 1109 points. California won the team title with 1629.5 and Stanford finished second (1401). Arizona was fourth (954.5), followed by UCLA (951.5), Utah (652), Arizona State (610), Washington State (369.5) and Oregon State (286).
Junior Kendyl Stewart kicked off USC’s winning streak on Friday, winning her second career title in the 100 yard fly. Stewart won the 100 yard fly in 51.10, 0.04 ahead the second place finisher. Stewart first won the 100 yard fly Pac-12 title as a freshman in 2013 when her 51.32 broke Lindsey DePaul’s 2011 record time of 51.34. With the 51.10, Stewart broke her school record in the race for the second time in two weeks, as she had improved it to 51.25 against UCLA on Feb. 13.
“The race felt strong and sharp from the beginning,” Stewart said. “I’m happy to have a best time under my belt heading into NCAAs in a couple of weeks. It’s also awesome to score some big points for the team to help secure a top-3 finish.”
On Saturday, senior Haley Ishimatsu became the first Pac-12 woman to win the platform three straight years and was also named the Pac-12 Women’s Swimming and Diving Scholar-Athlete of the Year. Ishimatsu won her third platform championship with 368.75. Her final dive in a five-dive set earned her an impressive six 9.0s and one 8.5.
Her performance makes her the second woman to win the platform title three times in her career.
“I’m so thankful for competing so well at Pac-12s the past three years,” Ishimatsu said. “I’m very honored to be the three-time Pac-12 platform champion. I’m also honored to be the Pac-12 Scholar Athlete of the Year. I’m excited for the NCAA zones next week and NCAA championships.”
Senior Andrea Kropp added another individual title to USC’s collection with a win in the 200 yard breast. It was her first career conference title. Kropp made her third straight appearance in the   Pac-12 200 yard breast final and this time was able to take home a victory in her final Pac-12 championship, winning in 2:08.51, 0.85 ahead of Stanford senior Katie Olsen (2:09.36).
Kropp is USC’s first 200 yard breaststroke title winner since              six-time Olympic medalist Rebecca Soni won in 2009.
“It was so amazing to be able to win my first Pac-12 title in my last race with the entire team,” Kropp said. “Having all of them behind me gave me the motivation that I needed to swim fast when it got tough. Winning and getting such a good time gives me confidence and only makes me even more excited for the upcoming NCAAs.”
The NCAA Championships will be held in Greensboro, North Carolina, on March 19-21.

People like to declare SNL done. As was joked about in the 40th anniversary special a couple of weeks ago, it’s only a matter of time before someone dusts off the old chestnut of a headline “Saturday Night Dead,” for a piece about how the show has declined past the point of no return. But it usually comes off as a bit ridiculous. Any show that has been around for 40 years will have its ups and downs in quality. Right now, the show is in a state of flux. In the last year, Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Jason Sudeikis, Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen all left the show to pursue bigger projects, leaving a cast of relative unknowns to carry the torch.
A new cast is an opportunity to incorporate different talents to produce fresh material. Despite some bright spots, however, the latest season of SNL does not have the excitement that comes with new blood. It has a strange dynamic to it. The cast members all are talented, and that shines through. But, unfortunately, the material itself is largely uneven.
When SNL was born 40 years ago, it was on the cutting edge. When Lorne Michaels introduced the world to the Not Ready For Prime Time Players, they were a rebellious bunch of upstarts. John Belushi, Chevy Chase and the rest of the players were supremely talented, but they were also extremely cool. They pushed the envelope and were the most dangerous thing on TV.
In the very first episode, unsuspecting viewers were treated to a tiny bit of subtle genius by the legendary Andy Kaufman miming along to a recording of the Mighty Mouse theme. George Carlin, another comedy legend, followed by providing a bit of his incendiary stand up. There simply was nothing else like it on TV at the time. There was also not much else on TV in general at the time. In October 1975, there were only four channels — ABC, CBS, NBC, and sometimes PBS — on people’s TVs. The majority of programming was fun but light stuff. Happy Days was in its third season, M*A*S*H was in its fourth. In that landscape, SNL was a firecracker of fresh material.
It continued to be one for many years. There were many ups and downs in terms of quality. That is to be expected in a show with such a fluid cast. For the 40th anniversary, Rolling Stone did a ranking of all 141 people who have been on the show’s cast over the years (Robert Downey Jr. came last, Belushi came first). While reading through the list, after getting past some very questionable rankings (Really? Norm Macdonald at 135?), what emerges is the sheer volume of talent that went through Studio 8H. It is impressive stuff, but it also makes the reasons behind the highs and lows in the show’s quality over the years very clear.
It is difficult to bring a team together, especially one filled with talents and egos. Anyone who has followed the NBA over the last few years can attest to the growing pains that supposed “super teams” have gone through before finding their groove. It takes time to get all the pieces come together. With the yearly turnover in talent, there often wasn’t time to get everything together, even when great talents were present. SNL washouts include Ben Stiller, Sarah Silverman and Downey Jr. All are clearly great talents who flourished afterward, but they washed out after only one season on the show. Sometimes it clicked and everything came together at light speed, and sometimes it didn’t.
What was pretty much a constant, however, was Lorne Michael’s ability to spot talent. There are some famous misses — Jim Carrey being the most notable one — but for the most part Michaels was able to bring together an absolutely stellar collection of talent. Eddie Murphy, Bill Murray and Will Ferrell were some of the electric talents that graced the stage, but even when there wasn’t transcendent talent in the roster, the overall quality of the performers was rarely less than incredible for a show that, again, went through cast members like most people go through socks.
This is the case with this season’s cast. There are some genuinely gifted performers out there. Kate McKinnon is a gem, and she will be joining with Melissa McCarthy and SNL graduate Wiig in the hugely anticipated Ghostbusters reboot. Leslie Jones will also be joining them, which is exciting as the rookie is already one of the most compelling talents on the show. Jay Pharoah, Michael Che and Pete Davidson are extremely talented, and Kyle Mooney and Beck Bennett, a pair of USC alumni, have introduced a hilarious new spin on the digital short. There’s no Murphy or Murray, but the talent is there. So what is the problem?
The most likely culprit is the nature of our pop culture. A major network show simply is not positioned to be cutting edge these days. NBC, despite being much maligned as the eternally struggling major network, is actually better than its competitors at pushing boundaries as Parks and Recreation, Community, and Hannibal have recently shown. Unfortunately, SNL relies on current events for its content, and that is just what scares a big network like NBC the most. Offending the wrong group of people is the nightmare for the Jack Donaghy types calling the shots. SNL is too confined by the pearl-clutching bigwigs at NBC to compete with the excellent slate of comedy a viewer can find on Comedy Central or HBO. By the time SNL hits the air, Jon Stewart has already squeezed most of the comedy out of current events on a near-daily basis, often leaving sketches toothless. And when SNL does push the boundaries even further, the backlash can be huge, again the curse of being on a major network. When Dakota Johnson appeared on a sketch involving ISIS this week, the Internet was up in arms that SNL would even consider joking about ISIS, even though Stewart, Stephen Colbert and John Oliver had already been doing just that for months.
SNL is not done, and it is far from dead, but the 40th anniversary show was a stark reminder of how golden the days used to be and how very difficult it will be to reach them again given the current TV ecosystem.

The donning of umbrellas this weekend might seem incongruous with reports that California is in a crippling and historic drought. But make no mistake, despite recent rainfall, the state is enduring dangerously dry conditions that some geologists believe have not been reached in almost 500 years. As the mega-drought persists through its fourth year, the lack of water is having deleterious effects not only on endemic ecosystems that rely on yearly rainfall but also on the state’s economy.
Agriculture in particular — a major engine of California’s prosperity, producing nearly 25 percent of the nation’s crops — has taken a major blow. A report out of University of California, Davis estimates a loss of 17,100 jobs, $810 million in crop revenue, and more than $2 billion in total economic costs. Despite California Gov. Jerry Brown’s declaration of a state of emergency last January, government efforts to diminish state water use have been futile. Individual Californians must assume personal responsibility and adapt their habits to accommodate the current water situation. It is also imperative that the state and local governments work to rethink aging, inefficient infrastructures in places like Los Angeles and Riverside in order to safeguard California against future or continued drought.
One need not look much further than downtown Los Angeles to realize that daily behaviors and practices do not yet reflect the reality of the state’s worst drought on record. Green lawns are abundant, fountains run unfettered and residents fill their pools and wash their cars in their driveways. Over the summer, despite Brown’s call for a 20 percent reduction in water use, state officials found that use actually increased statewide.
New rules implemented by the state Water Resources Control Board in August impose a $500 fine on water wasters. Implementation, however, has been difficult. In Los Angeles, for example, the Department of Water and Power employs just four water-wasting inspectors to monitor the water-use activities of more than 4 million people. And their jurisdiction is limited to what can be visibly observed taking place outside of peoples homes, such as the over-watering of lawns. Few fines have been issued.
The policing of water use will not be the end of the water problem. Residents must assume personal responsibility in the form of self-restraint: briefer showers, less frequent use of dishwashers and washing machines, and the installation of drought-resistant landscapes.
To match individual efforts, city planners must streamline urban water systems, allowing for the collection of roof and street runoff for use in irrigation. Currently, most rainfall — what little we’ve had — runs off of paved surfaces, channeled through concrete aqueducts, and sent spilling out into the ocean. Prominent figures in engineering and urban design are now calling on developers to “build cities like sponges.” Such cities would be equipped with permeable driveways that allow for the replenishment of the aquifer. Roofs would be shaped like bowls, catching and diverting as much rain as possible, and plumbing would be streamlined in such a way that only non-potable water flowed through toilets, conserving the oh-so-valuable water we rely on for drinking.
Such modifications in behavior and technology must come to fruition if California is going to weather the harsh drought. According to a study from the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences, despite the current El Niño warm ocean period, the drought is expected to continue through 2015, endangering major economic sectors and the communities that rely on them.
Our necessary response ultimately comes down to basic arithmetic. By NASA’s estimates, it will take around 11 trillion gallons of rainwater, or 17 million Olympic-sized swimming pools, before recovery can take place. We can’t control rainfall, and today’s reservoir levels are worrisomely low. But we can control how we use the water that is currently available to us.

This past Friday, Nathaniel Haas, an opinion columnist for the Daily Trojan, attacked the USC College Republicans for being “blatantly hypocritical,” and even called on some members to resign due to a photo posted on social media. Ultimately, we made the decision to remove the photo because of numerous comments attacking African American members of our club. We felt that these comments were distracting from our official statement expressing our displeasure with Davis’s presence on campus and the fact that the student body was forced to foot the bill for her speech.
It is also important to note that at no point did our club attempt to censor Angela Davis’ speech nor do we tolerate the act of prohibiting the right to free speech in any form. Mr. Haas presumably failed to read our original statement sent to all social media outlets on the night of Davis’s speech. The following lines from our response to Davis’ speech prove that Haas selectively read the statement and made a false claim based on faulty predictions:
“Let it be known that the USC College Republicans in stark contrast with Angela Davis, Black Panther sympathizers and communists, believe that all people regardless of race, socioeconomic class, gender or sexuality, should be free to exercise their economic agency, create businesses and employ their capital in free markets without unnecessary and burdensome government intervention. We support and advocate on behalf of those Americans who wish to be productive citizens as opposed to bitter subjects to a tired ideology that encourages dependence and exacerbates poverty. Freedom and prosperity are the keys to a bright future.”
Mr. Haas then called a past event held by the USC College Republicans featuring Ann Coulter into question. We would like to point out that this event was paid for in full by our organization, through generous donations, and from grants. At no point did we ask University Student Government, Program Board or any of the numerous student assemblies on campus—all of which are funded by university tuition dollars— to pay for our event. This is in stark contrast to the Angela Davis event, in which the entire student body was forced into paying for her speaking fees.
Simply put, we felt it was absolutely necessary to dispel the false narratives that Davis perpetuates, bring light to the questionable events in her past, and call attention to her deeply concerning ties with radical organizations like the Black Panther Party and the Communist Party. We believe that it is the right of every student group to bring diverse speakers with differing opinions to the USC campus, and it is our right to criticize those with whom we disagree.
We stand by all of our decisions, and call Mr. Haas’ journalistic integrity into question. We see Mr. Haas’ unreasonable request as nothing more than an attempt to shut down opposition and intellectual diversity on campus. This call to silence dissenting opinion is nothing more than a witch-hunt meant to attack those whom ideologically oppose Mr. Haas.
USC College Republicans 
 
Yeah, SC is “traditionally” an a-political school, but especially a conservative-leaning one that engenders a capitalistic proclivity. But times are changing, and SC wants to become like its crosstown rival. Oh wait, isn’t Davis some kind of professor there?. I guess being liberal is the “new cool.” SC will change in the coming years, if it hasn’t already, like it or not.
Fight on guys! As much as diversity is lauded on college campuses, political diversity and diversity of opinion is not (even on an a-political campus like USC). You are brave for speaking out against the majority opinion.
USC College Republicans memebers, I applaud your insistence on not backing down from the attack of Mr. Haas. as it is in the real world, liberals are all about acceptance e of other’s differences until your opinion differs from theirs.  In this case Haas is the hypocrite,  not you. This media bias continues in the public forum, still, but it is folks like you who will lead this great country out of the current crisis of emotional despair and bring America back to the leadership and inspiration to make this country great again. Stay focused and determined. Fight On.

Over the past few years, New Jersey-based trio group Cash Cash has built up a phenomenal presence in the world of EDM. Currently consisting of Jean Paul Makhlouf, Alex Makhlouf and Samuel Frisch, the group has produced official remixes for Krewella, Bruno Mars, Icona Pop and more. Their most popular song, “Take Me Home,” features vocals by Bebe Rexha and is categorized under the genre of progressive house. Since then, they have released “Lightning” and “Surrender,” which were hits as well. The DT sat down with JP (Jean Paul) to get a glimpse inside the lives of this successful trio, and — more importantly — figure out why JP likes turtles so much.
DT: Your name came from people coming after all your cash, and you actually not having any. How relevant does that statement feel today now that you’ve made it so far in the EDM world?
JP: For me personally, I think it’s a constant reminder of when we had nothing, or it was only 10 people watching us perform, or when there was just no one that really cared. This just puts it in perspective every time we hear our song on the radio or we hear people sing along at a festival. It makes us really appreciate everything that’s happened in the last few years.
DT: Sometimes, it’s the little things in life that count. What’s the best “little thing” about being Cash Cash?
JP: Honestly, we all just like to watch TV shows. We’re big fans of Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, stuff like that. Better Call Saul — I’m into that right now. Sometimes, our whole life is so wrapped up in partying, being at the club. When we have a few hours to ourselves, we like to just get in bed and catch up on our shows.
DT: Who’s your favorite character on Breaking Bad?
JP: That’s a tough one, that’s a tough one. Obviously Walt of course, but I think Pinkman. Probably Pinkman.
DT: Tell us your favorite story about being on tour with Alex and Sam.
JP: The cool thing is that Sam and I do most of the touring ourselves, and Alex usually stays back in the studio working on something because there’s always so much to do in dance music. When we were all touring, we felt like we didn’t get enough done and it got too focused on us being away from the studio. So we decided to just tour with the two of us. Sometimes we change it up too, and Sam and Alex will go out and I will stay back. Or I will go out and Sam will stay back. So we rotate a little bit, but 80 percent of the time it’s usually just Sam and me.
DT: Is it difficult to tour without each other?
JP: It’s pretty easy. That’s the thing about DJing: you don’t really need three people to do it. There are things that are cool to do when we have the three of us up there. We can trigger more acappellas, or do more things on the fly as far as making our own mash-ups, tricking things out. At the end of the day, two is plenty.
DT: You were talking with Jojo on the radio about people having Cash Cash tattoos. Do you have any tattoos?
JP: I have a few, no Cash Cash tattoos, but yeah, I love tattoos. I think they’re just another way to express yourself and mark different periods of your life.
DT: What is your favorite tattoo?
JP: I have this one that says, “For me this is heaven.” It’s a Jimmy Eat World song, and for me it means this is heaven right now. Living life for now and just enjoying it all.
DT: Is there a story behind your love for turtles?
JP: You know, I think it probably started with Ninja Turtles back when I was really young. I always thought they were just such cool, fascinating creatures. Reptiles in general, I think — snakes, lizards. Then I just started catching them, but we always let them go.
DT: I know you guys like to eat sushi a lot. What’s your favorite restaurant?
JP: That’s another tough question. We recently hit up Sugarfish in L.A. and I was actually blown away because I’m always feel like L.A. sushi is not as good as N.Y. sushi, but this place had me blown away. I like classic style sushi, like sushi Nozawa, because we spent a lot of time in Japan.
