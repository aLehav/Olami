Surprisingly, the biggest wig reveal of 2018 did not come from the 10th season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” In fact, it occurred on an Asian television show, and made waves online when an episode trailer was released last Friday.
In a stunning turn of events on “The Bachelor Vietnam,” 20-year-old contestant Minh Thu confessed her love — not for the actual bachelor, but for fellow competitor Truc Nhu during a rose ceremony.  Both women left the set after Truc Nhu’s tearful confrontation with bachelor Quoc Trung. 
“I went into this competition to find love, but I’ve found that love for myself,” Minh Thu, who had just been eliminated, proclaimed. “It’s not you.It’s someone else.”
While Truc Nhu decided to remain on the show after an off-screen meeting with Quoc Trung, the tender moment between the two female contestants went viral and led to hundreds of media headlines, with commenters praising showrunners for putting the moment on air. 
As an American viewer, it was astonishing to think that a Vietnamese reality show would even dare to air such an event on national television. After all, social media users still go crazy when American celebrities publicly come out. I spent the entire week trying to formulate an opinion on the whole ordeal. Was that moment a sign of progress for LGBTQ+ people in Vietnam? Or was it merely a publicity stunt?
According to Vietnamese news outlet Zing, The New York Times and some of my Vietnamese cousins (just to triple-check), the narrative surrounding the iconic television moment was quite different; in fact, most outlets in Vietnam were reporting more about global reactions to the video than about the video itself. 
While this initially surprised me, I realized that maybe there is a reason why the Vietnamese media reacted so differently compared to American outlets like NextShark, Buzzfeed and CNN, which catapulted the clip into a global viral sensation. After doing some personal reflection, I came to understand that Minh Thu’s confession of love wasn’t so much of a shock to Vietnamese viewers as it was to the rest of the world. 
It may be as simple as this: Vietnamese people’s perception of the LGBTQ+ community and same-sex relationships is not as conservative as the Western world believes it to be. 
As with so many other queer people, I spent most of my teenage years seeking self-acceptance and self-love, and one of the ways I did so was by watching TV shows and movies with queer narratives.
I recall spending many late evenings as a 16-year-old, hunched over my computer screen watching movies like “Brokeback Mountain” and “Milk” — my guilty pleasures. I would make sure to lock the door so my parents wouldn’t walk in on me crying (or watching a scene of two men having sex). And while I thoroughly enjoyed watching every work I scoured the internet for, it was the Asian movies I consumed that allowed me to truly connect my sexuality with my Asian identity. 
One of them is “Love of Siam,” a film that I have seen at least 10 times since I first watched it as a shy, inexperienced twink. The Thai feature, which came out in 2007, is a poignant love story between two high school-aged boys who reconnect after being separated as childhood friends. As with the endings of many gay films, Mew and Tong’s romance was tragic, but not in the same way as that of Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar in “Brokeback Mountain.” The most tear-inducing moment in “Love of Siam” comes at the very end when Tong says to Mew: “I can’t be your boyfriend, but that doesn’t mean I don’t love you.”
Another film is the 2011 Vietnamese drama “Lost in Paradise,” which recounts the experiences of three gay men: Khoi, Lam and Dong. Set in Ho Chi Minh City, “Lost in Paradise” explores various facets of homosexuality in the face of cultural conservatism and other societal issues, such as prostitution and gang violence. 
These two groundbreaking Southeast Asian films allowed me to understand my identity as a young, queer Asian person through a different lens. Both of them were much more about coming of age than they were about tragic endings — the most problematic aspect of American works featuring LGBTQ+ characters. In the same vein, I would argue that Asian media in the late 2000s and early 2010s was much more nuanced than Western media at the time. 
Going back to the iconic moment on this week’s episode of “The Bachelor Vietnam,” maybe watching Minh Thu proclaim her love for Truc Nhu wasn’t all so earth-shattering for Vietnamese audiences because same-sex relationships aren’t as stigmatized in Vietnam as the Western world often thinks they are. 
It isn’t so surprising either when you look at legislation passed in the last couple years. In 2014, the Southeast Asian country abolished laws prohibiting same-sex marriage. And in 2015, Vietnamese lawmakers finally allowed people with gender reassignment surgery to reclassify as their new gender on legal documents. While social stigmas against the LGBTQ+ community still exist, Vietnam’s government is making healthy strides toward equality through legislative reform.
This week’s episode of “The Bachelor Vietnam” shattered long-held stereotypes about the “supposedly backwards” Eastern world, and educated me as a Vietnamese American, about the contextual analysis necessary to buy into commonly held narratives about queer people. 
It’s time we stop placing shock value on queer relationships, and arbitrarily labeling queerness as a binary between Eastern and Western perspectives.

A Lyft driver who dropped four USC students off on the side of the I-10 Freeway last week has been suspended from driving for the service, which contracts with the University to provide free rides to students in the University Park area during designated times.
Sydney Nguyen, a senior majoring in business administration, said she and three friends were kicked out of their Lyft around 1 a.m. on Saturday morning while heading back to campus from a birthday celebration after the driver became enraged by their noise level.
In a statement, Lyft said that it deactivated Nguyen’s account as well as the driver’s, and is investigating the incident. 
“The safety of the Lyft community is our top priority, and we take these reports very seriously,” the statement said.
According to Nguyen, her account was reinstated on Monday while the driver’s account will remain permanently disabled.
Nguyen, who wrote about the experience in a Facebook post, said the driver allowed them to turn on music, but became agitated when they began to sing along. The driver yelled at Nguyen’s friends in the back of the car and accused them of being drunk, though Nguyen said they were not. After everyone had quieted down, one of Nguyen’s friends laughed, at which point the Lyft driver threatened to kick them out before they reached their destination. One of Nguyen’s friends apologized and tried to reason with the driver.
“I just felt like I needed to speak up for them,” Nguyen said. “[I said,] ‘OK, if you’re going to handle the situation like this, I’m going to be giving you a bad rating.’”
Nguyen asked the driver to take them to the nearest exit so they could call a different Lyft. Instead, the driver reportedly pulled onto the shoulder lane of the I-10 freeway headed toward USC and told Nguyen and her friends to “get the f-ck out” of his car. 
“I [was] in disbelief,” Nguyen said. “This escalated further than [I could] ever imagine.”
The walk to the nearest exit took nearly 25 minutes, and it was so dark that Nguyen feared she and her friends would get hit by passing traffic.
For Nguyen, as well as students who read her account on Facebook, the incident drew attention to the safety risks of using rideshare services. In January, NBC Los Angeles reported that a Lyft passenger was killed in a hit-and-run after being dropped off along the side of the I-110 freeway.
USC started its Safe Rides Program in 2015, and has contracted with Lyft since August 2017. Although Nguyen’s Lyft was not paid for by the Safe Rides Program, she feared that other students may have similar experiences with other Lyft drivers.
“I felt like I needed to speak to the community because we heavily rely on [Lyft] to get to and from campus,” Nguyen said.
Nguyen said there should be a better system in place for matching drivers with passengers, and that Lyft’s safety features should be easier to use. She found that Lyft’s emergency hotline is only accessible by talking on the phone with a Lyft representative, and can’t be reached directly through the app.
“There’s so many clicks [needed] just to get to the hotline,” Nguyen said. “I was like, why isn’t this just a one-click thing on [the] app?”
USC did not comment on the incident in time for publication.

A professor at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy is under scrutiny after writing an email response to students on Thursday that “accusers sometimes lie” in sexual abuse allegations.
The remark was a reply to a schoolwide invitation to a “Coffee and Title IX” event hosted by the Price Women and Allies. The event intends to inform students on the details of Title IX, and to spark a “candid and open dialogue on the realities of sexual violence and misconduct on college campuses.” 
PWA’s email asked members of the Price School to believe survivors, referring to Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony in front of a Senate committee at Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination hearing.  Ford alleged that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school. 
Price Professor James Moore replied to the email with a statement deemed as controversial by some who read the exchange.
“If the day comes you are accused of some crime or tort of which you are not guilty, and you find your peers automatically believing your accuser, I expect you find yourself a stronger proponent of due process protections than you are now,” Moore wrote. “Accusers sometimes lie.”
The reply prompted multiple responses from professors, alumni and students, including Price Professor LaVonna Lewis, who criticized Moore for his statement.
“If you believe that accusers lie, you should also believe that abusers lie,” she wrote in a reply.
Price Dean Jack Knott addressed the situation later that evening in an email to the Price school. He noted that the choice and timing of words matter and that Moore’s words were “insensitive and incendiary.”
“The statement made — that accusers lie — in my opinion showed a lack of sensitivity to the current climate, here at the University and in communities across the country,” Knott wrote. “The issue here is not a question of free speech, but a question of respect for the students and other members of the Price School community.” 
Moore, however, told the Daily Trojan that his response was in line with PWA’s invitation for “a candid conversation.” 
“I’m a little concerned about the direction that our [Title IX] procedures might go,” Moore said. “The prospect of automatically believing every accusation just seems to be an untenable way to approach adjudication in these cases.” 
Lewis, who was the first to reply to Moore’s email, said in an interview with Daily Trojan that while she understands the importance of free speech, people should be more sensitive to the current climate surrounding sexual misconduct.
“For people to not be aware how much tension there is right now around that topic and to be so dismissive of something the students were doing was something that I really couldn’t give a pass,” Lewis said.
Jessica Jaworski, who graduated from Price in 2017, wrote in her email reply that while Moore’s words would have been inappropriate on “a normal day,” they were even more so on an “emotional day” like Thursday. 
Jaworski tied the professor’s remarks to the hundreds of sexual misconduct allegations against former health center gynecologist George Tyndall. 
“I would think that in light of the recent revelations of abuse at the USC Health Center that the Price school would not want this to be how it is represented to both current and former students,” Jaworski wrote. 
Aria Cataño, a junior majoring in public policy, reacted to Moore’s remarks, saying that they contribute to a “toxic environment of doubt” for sexual assault victims. 
“We’ve seen examples of politicians [and] people in power discrediting women throughout the country and trying to put doubt into the public mind — doubt as to whether or not we should trust women,” Cataño said. 
However, Moore said that the reactions to his comments were healthy and that those who responded were entitled to their opinions and understood the emotional nature of the topic.
“If some of them are annoyed by ideas that are opposed to theirs, well that’s just preparation for adult life,” Moore said. 
Esther Nguyen, the director of community relations for PWA, said that while Moore’s response was disappointing, the organization will use the situation as a teaching moment.
“We want to use this as an opportunity to highlight what’s actually important: “The stories of survivors and how we can work together to make schools, professional settings and all spaces really safer and more equitable for everyone,” Nguyen said.
USC said it would not have a response in time for publication.

Student organizations, including the Students for Justice in Palestine, Latinx Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly and Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, gathered at Tommy Trojan to speak of various threats the Trojan Family and L.A. are facing. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Nearly 150 students, faculty and local community members gathered at Tommy Trojan for a “Solidarity Rally” Thursday evening to watch impassioned speeches regarding violence, assault and hate speech.
“The purpose of the rally is to provide a space in which … boundaries between students, faculty and the community — which can normally seem very rigid — can be broken and we can show we’re one united Trojan Family… and one united community of Los Angeles,” said Black Student Assembly Advocacy Chair Kameron Hurt. “We want to provide a space where unity prevails, where community members and students can air grievances that they feel.”
Along with the speeches, student organizations promoted their organizations and VoteSC registered students to vote.
To open the event, Mato Standing Soldier, a student leader from the Native American Student Union led the crowd in a prayer from the Lakota culture. 
“Thank you, Creator, for the day you have given us … allow for us to have good progress and to have everyone’s questions be answered and everyone’s comments be attended to,” Standing Soldier said.
Professor Charles Davis III from the Rossier School of Education was the first speaker at the rally. He encouraged students to allow their voices to be heard, as they can create change.
“I want you to think about power, I want you to be thinking about transformation, I want you to be thinking about miracles.” Davis said. “Within each one of you and all of you together, you have the power to transform the society and the campus of [USC].”
Led by Davis, the crowd then proceeded to chant, “Power. Transformation. Miracles.”
Paul Lanctot, a caseworker from the L.A. Tenants Union, encouraged students to think about how the University affects the surrounding community. 
“Gentrification is sweeping through communities,” said Lanctot, who introduced a former tenant of Exposition Boulevard who was recently evicted. “[He] is a tenant that lived down the street and his whole block was displaced for USC students.”
The Daily Trojan previously reported that developers are expanding housing for USC students, and has been working with property managers to evict local residents. 
Mai Mizuno, a former USG official, spoke about what she called a culture of abuse at USC following her own assault from former Engemann Health Center gynecologist George Tyndall. 
“This isn’t about politics, it’s about our well-being, our livelihood,” she said. 
USG senator Meagan Lane encouraged students to attend Senate meetings to voice their grievances. 
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love and protect one another. We have nothing to lose but our chains,” she chanted. “You need to know how to mobilize your voice and you need to know who your allies are.”
During an open forum, rally attendees were given the opportunity to step up and speak. Members from the Students for Justice in Palestine and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly spoke about the Oct. 4 event at Bovard Auditorium featuring conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.
“It is one thing to mobilize and one thing to show up on the day of … but it’s another thing to … continue that drive,” Hurt said. “Demand that they start reacting to what we have to say instead of us reacting to what they have to say.”

Adriana Sanchez | Daily Trojan
In early 2017, over 1,000 protestors swarmed Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union at UC Berkeley in response to a talk by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. Riot police barricaded the building while dozens of masked, anti-fascist demonstrators fired Roman candles and broke windows. Only about 15 minutes after the protests erupted, police announced that Yiannopoulos would no longer deliver his scheduled speech. 
Incidents like this sparked a nationwide debate over the limits of free speech, with many saying that leftists encouraged censorship and discouraged free debate. Even opponents of Yiannopoulos said that Berkeley students went too far and behaved too radically. They said that he was entitled to express his opinions, regardless of their incendiary nature.
Several months later, following a Berkeley City Council decision to authorize the use of pepper spray on violent protesters, students showed up en masse to protest a talk featuring Yiannopoulos’ former Breitbart News co-editor, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. Shapiro is now scheduled to spew his rhetoric at Bovard Auditorium on Oct. 4, in an event organized by USC’s Young Americans for Freedom chapter.
But allowing Shapiro to speak on campus does not show USC’s commitment to free speech. Rather, permitting him to speak reveals the University’s willingness to legitimize hateful rhetoric by giving it a platform at a highly regarded institution. Regardless of his right to free speech, USC has no reason to endorse him or normalize his opinions within academia.
To be fair, Shapiro’s rhetoric is more mild than Yiannopoulos’ — which may not be saying much. Shapiro has, however, called transgender people “mentally ill” and takes every opportunity to belittle racial minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community and marginalized groups in general. He’s the standard camouflaged bigot and embodies the phrase, “I’m not racist, but…” 
As such, USC’s decision to grant Shapiro a platform is a mistake. It amounts to a tacit endorsement, one that subjugates vulnerable people who have struggled for decades for opportunities in academia. There are thousands of people at USC who work hard to advocate for inclusivity and equality; it is insulting to see their work diminished by the University’s implicit validation of a man who tweets things like “Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage.” 
The idea that controversial right wingers like Shapiro and Yiannopoulos should be given platforms at universities has been mischaracterized as an issue of free speech. Attacks on free speech do not come from popular, democratic resistance; they arise from institutional and governmental censorship.
To understand how the power dynamics surrounding freedom of speech operate, we must consider the past. The free speech movement at UC Berkeley in the 1960s, for example, spawned from students being prohibited by their university from distributing flyers about political issues, particularly those related to Civil Rights or anti-war movements. The problem here was the official, authoritative censorship of ordinary people. 
On the other hand, modern day provocateurs like Shapiro and Yiannopoulos write for major publications and their voices reach millions of people. Pretending that disapproving students presents a genuine challenge to their freedom of speech is absolutely ridiculous. Such a claim is rendered trivial next to more profound freedom of speech issues.
And just because students don’t want Shapiro on their campus doesn’t make them close-minded or unable to handle differences in opinion. It does mean people — especially those who experience the brunt of bigotry — can appreciate the delicacy of language and see the hateful ideas behind Shapiro’s rhetoric.
USC should be committed to free speech, but it should not protect hate speech. The spectrum of discourse is not fixed in the fabric of society. It changes constantly based on what we deem acceptable. When cultures allow hateful language into public discourse, hateful action suddenly appears less taboo.
According to the American Psychological Association, “political discourse may devalue members of unfamiliar groups,” having harmful repercussions in how people interact with each other. Shapiro aims to do just that: Devalue people who are already marginalized and play it off as contrarian logic.
In addition, Shapiro is simply not a serious intellectual. He’s a pandering clown who uses fancy vocabulary to make his listeners think he possesses some grand understanding of a theatrical political landscape in which each party must capitalize on the news cycle to earn cheap favorability points with their bases. 
He reasons that liberals and leftists are thoughtless, overly emotional sycophants of the liberal media, and paints thinly-veiled hate masquerading as logic for a base of angry nerds. In reality, he has nothing substantial to offer. Allowing him to speak promises only to embolden bigotry and make marginalized people fear for their safety.

With fusion restaurants combining cultures and cuisines from all over the world opening every day, it might be easier to find what Los Angeles doesn’t have to offer. Here is a guide to gourmet hamburger  joints in this culinary city.
Belcampo Meat Co.
317 S Broadway St.
Los Angeles, CA 90013
For quality cuts of meat, try out Belcampo Meat Co. This butchery is known not only for raising its own cattle at Belcampo Farm, but also for processesing meat directly in Belcampo Butchery and selling it in one of its Belcampo shops. The result is a restaurant with some of the highest quality meat in the city.
 Belcampo Meat Co. rivals In-N-Out in offering a quickly prepared $6 burger. The burgers are made with either turkey or beef patties with a special house sauce on a regular potato bun. For those willing to splurge, try  the $15 Belcampo Burger, made with a half-pound, grass-fed beef patty, with caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, and the house sauce, topped with a brioche bun.
The Counter
725 W. 7th St.
Los Angeles, CA 90017
For a more D.I.Y. experience, try out chain The Counter. Visitors can create their own burgers, starting from $12. The process begins with a third-pound turkey, veggie, beef or chicken patty. From there, th choices are nearly endless with the various bun choices and toppings, including the most common brioche-style bun and toppings like kale, cranberries and even scallions. 
 The Counter lets its customers also choose from 13 different cheeses and 22 different sauces, from roasted garlic aioli to spicy tomato jam.
Is it extra? Yes. 
But is it worth it? Absolutely.
Shake Shack 
400 West 8th St.
Los Angeles, CA 90014
Hailing from the East Coast, this burger joint is In-N-Out’s most notable rival. Shake Shack is prized for its ShackBurger, made with 100 percent, all-natural Angus beef. It’s made with either a single or double patty, cheese, with lettuce, tomato, and a special secret ShakeSauce.   
Cassells
3600 W. 6th St.
Los Angeles, CA 90020
Established in 1948, this iconic L.A. lunch destination has reinvented itself in Koreatown. Cassells is known for its hamburgers, but restaurateur David Chang thinks otherwise. He once called its patty melts some of the best he’s ever had. Cassells grinds fresh beef every day, and creates its own mayonnaise. For lunch, try the three-pound burgers with onions, pickles and thousand island dressing served on a Portuguese bun.
 Cassells also added milkshakes, malts and a classic 1950s breakfast menu with homemade pies and a coffee bar to its menu, setting up the perfect environment for an Instagram-worthy lunch date.
Burgers Never Say Die 
This underground burger joint has been discovered by mainstream audiences and has become a street food obsession. Originally a food truck, Burgers Never Say Die caused frenzies as lines curl around the traveling restaurant  as fans waited to try one of L.A.’s not-so-secret burgers. Part of the mystery is that customers never know where they’re going to appear next, and curious eaters must follow its Instagram (@burgersneversaydie) to track the joint down. Despite the location hassle, this place is beyond worthy of the hype.
 For only $5, Burgers Never Say Die sells a simple California-style burger made with fresh ground beef, commercial buns and American cheese. Still, it has become an Instagram phenomenon, and customers line down blocks every day to grab this delicious hamburger at an unparalleled price. Luckily, Burgers Never Say Die just signed a lease to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant in Silver Lake, so everyone can soon enjoy their thin double-patty burgers in a permanent location.

MacDonald Recital Hall was filled with classical string compositions on Wednesday night. The musicians played an eclectic repertoire, from Bach to Debussy. Graduate student Yaxin Tan (above) had been practicing since from the start of the semester. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
When the lights dimmed at Open Performance Evening in Jeanette MacDonald Recital Hall, there was a certain tranquility in the air. Audience members settled into their chairs, programs were passed around and performers began to file in through the back doors. All eyes were on center stage. 
Ten string musicians in the Thornton School of Music performed 10 pieces they’ve been perfecting all semester, ranging from composers like Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to Johann Sebastian Bach. The event was an opportunity for students to showcase their hard work and musical talents to their family, friends and the greater USC community.
The opening number was Bach’s “Violin Sonata No. 1 in G minor, BWV 1001,” featuring a sweet, melodic performance on violin by graduate student Yaxin Tan. Next came a dramatic duet entitled “Fratres” by Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, which saw graduate students Linda-Anette Verte on violin and Alin Melik-Adamyan on piano. An Estonian foreign exchange student, Verte said she has been practicing “Fratres” for a month and that she really loves being at Thornton so far. 
“I came from far away and I love L.A. and I love Thornton [because] everyone is so nice and welcoming,” Verte said.
Moving through the program, there was a performance for everyone’s musical taste. Whether it be the aggressive, skill-intensive “Dance of the Green Devil” by Gaspar Cassadó or the smooth sounds of Claude Debussy’s “Beau Soir,” the lineup at Open Performance Evening catered to diverse preferences. 
Although the recital hall was not full, the spectators present were nothing short of captivated. Audience member Xinyu Zhao, a freshman majoring in communication, had never attended any of Thornton’s musical performances and was pleasantly surprised by what she heard at the show. 
“The pieces played had a really diverse range, so I got to hear both melodic and skill-packed songs which kept me interested whenever someone new went on stage,” Zhao said. 
Another noteworthy performer was Bradley Bascon, a sophomore majoring in violin performance, who has played the instrument for nearly 16 years. 
When asked what his favorite piece of the showcase was, Bascon hesitated before answering: “The Tchaikovsky piece [because] it’s beautifully written for the violin and allows [me] to be a bit of a romantic … OK, a huge romantic.” 
The performance showcased the students’ talent and set a standard for future Thornton showcases. The musicians’ diverse repertoire further emphasized the scope of the Thornton program, and left the audience enthralled.

Early next week, the No. 5 USC women’s golf team heads to Chicago to make its mark at the Windy City Collegiate Classic, while the No. 20-ranked men’s team will participate in the Nike Invitational in Fort Worth, Tex.
Coming off of a strong third place finish at the Annika Intercollegiate tournament last week, the women’s team will be looking for a repeat performance from freshman Malia Nam, who placed second individually behind UCLA sophomore Patty Tavatanakit.
Nam shot 12-under across 54 holes, tying her for the second largest margin in school history.
Three other Trojans finished the event under par with sophomore Jennifer Chang tied for ninth place at 6-under, while junior Allisen Corpuz and sophomore Gabriela Ruffels tied for 21st at 1-under.
First-year coach Justin Silverman will look to Corpuz to be a leader for this team as she is the most senior starter among the squad. Corpuz is coming off a dominant sophomore season after being named an All American by the Women’s Golf Coaches Association.
This tournament should provide another opportunity for Silverman to prove that his team can compete with the other elite programs across the country, after trailing only Alabama and UCLA in last week’s opener by margins of 7 and 5 shots, respectively.
On the men’s side, the squad is coming in hot after a solid showing in their season opener, the Fighting Illini Invitational. The team was able to battle through a sluggish first day, as it was in the eighth spot of the 14 teams heading into day two, but steadily progressed from fourth to an eventual second-place finish.  
Three Trojans placed in the top six in the tournament, including junior PING All-American Justin Suh, sophomore Kaito Onishi and freshman Charlie Reiter. In his first start, Reiter proved that he could be a huge contributor to the team going into the future as he finished 4-under 66, helping USC finish at 7-over for the tournament.  
In the process of placing second, USC defeated higher ranked opponents like No. 11 California, No. 2 Alabama, No. 16 Illinois and No. 4 Texas A&M.  
Look for senior Justin Suh to return to his leadership role this year, who will be able to provide his learned experiences to an up-and-comer like freshman Charlie Reiter. If Reiter can maintain or improve upon the level of play that he displayed in his first performance as a Trojan, he could be a key player for the Trojans.
Both the women’s and men’s teams have already exceeded early expectations. While the women’s team will look to maintain its top-5 spot in the rankings, the men’s team will be coming in as underdogs aiming to take down higher ranked opponents in their upcoming tournament. The Trojans may be overshadowed by top-10 teams such as Vanderbilt, Oklahoma, and Florida, but they can still make an impressive run based on their breakout performance at the past tournament.

Senior cornerback Iman “Biggie” Marshall recorded six tackles against Stanford on Sept. 8. (Tal Volk | Daily Trojan)
 USC rebounded from back-to-back road defeats with a tightly contested win against previously undefeated Washington State. The Trojans came back from a 13-point deficit in the third quarter to beat the Cougars 39-36, in a game that USC desperately needed to win to fix its losing record. The offense had its most impressive performance this season, while the defense struggled more than it did in prior weeks. The 2-2 Trojans go on the road again on Saturday to face an Arizona squad with the same record looking to find its footing under new head coach Kevin Sumlin. 
USC offense vs. Arizona defense
Though the USC offense had struggled in the two prior games, the unit figured it out last Friday against the Cougars. It started on the ground, with the Trojans running the ball efficiently and effectively, with the backs gaining 166 rushing yards on the night with two touchdowns. Running backs redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai and sophomore Stephen Carr split that total almost evenly against the WSU front seven. 
A major part of that production was a direct result of the offensive line playing what might have been its best game of the season as they cleared large holes for the backs to run through — a far cry from the missed assignments and whiffed blocks from the Texas game. If the Trojans can replicate that effort on Saturday, they could break the game open — the Wildcats’ run defense has given up 197 yards a game so far this season, despite the play of linebacker Colin Schooler, who has recorded 23 solo tackles so far this season.
The Wildcat secondary should offer a tougher challenge to the Trojans, as it has held opponents to an average of 218 passing yards per game. The secondary is led by redshirt sophomore cornerback Lorenzo Burns, who led the Pac-12 in interceptions with five last season, and comes into this matchup with six pass breakups on the year. At 5-foot-10, Burns is at a size disadvantage with the Trojan receivers, but his athleticism and ball skills will make him tough to throw at. Freshman quarterback JT Daniels and the passing offense were rolling last week, as he finished with 241 yards for three touchdowns and no interceptions. 
“One of the things that [Daniels] does is he really takes advantage of the throws,” head coach Clay Helton said. “If he sees a one-on-one match up, he’s pulling the trigger … We have the playmakers outside to be able to make those plays and we have a quarterback that’s not scared to pull the trigger on them.”
Receivers freshman Amon-Ra St. Brown, redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns and junior Michael Pittman all caught touchdown passes on the day, all three of them simultaneously performing at a high level for the first time so far this season. St. Brown recorded 38 yards on two receptions, Vaughns had 64 yards on seven receptions and Pittman boasted seventy two on two. The pass blocking was  improved last week after disappointing showings the two prior games, a big part of the reason why the Trojans were so successful through the air with three touchdown passes.
Arizona offense vs. USC defense
Although they started the season slowly, the Arizona offense has started to click over the last two games, putting up 1,057 yards over those contests. The Wildcats’ ground game has been deadly, averaging 247 yards on the ground for the season, with a number of explosive playmakers in the backfield in running backs sophomore Gary Brightwell, redshirt junior Anthony Mariscal and redshirt sophomore J.J. Taylor. 
Taylor rushed for 284 yards and two touchdowns, winning Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week. Though the Trojans were stout against the run last week, giving up only 91 yards on 24 carries, they’ve shown a tendency to pick up big plays on the ground once runners get to the edge. With home-run threats like Taylor in the Wildcat backfield, USC can’t afford to let that happen on Saturday. 
However, having to account for one of the nation’s best dual-threat quarterbacks in Khalil Tate will make that task difficult. Tate has had an inefficient season on the ground so far, failing to reach even 20 yards rushing in a game, despite having 1,411 rushing yards last year. USC has struggled to defend rushing quarterbacks, and this year has been no different, as both quarterbacks sophomore Armani Rogers of UNLV and Sam Ehlinger of Texas gave the Trojans fits with their legs. 
“Every week, we work the turnover circuit,” Helton said. “Every Thursday I do the turnover DNA of a football team of what guys are loose with the ball, what you should be looking for and targeting with. Also the quarterback play, how he escapes the pocket. What’s his routine about when he gets off spot to be able to know where he’s going to be, all those things you try to help with. Hopefully they come in waves, I’m ready for a wave of turnovers.”
Containing Tate in the pocket will be one of the most important keys to the game for USC. Through the air, he’s been solid if unspectacular, throwing for 1,039 yards, eight touchdowns and two interceptions on a 54 percent completion percentage. However, the Trojans looked vulnerable to the pass last week, failing to generate much pressure on Washington State quarterback Gardner Minshew II for much of the game and allowing him to throw for 344 yards and three touchdowns. 
“It’s about defending Khalil Tate and stopping [Taylor] and hopefully holding up outside on those three great wideouts,” Helton said. 
Prediction: USC 35, Arizona 24.
USC’s offense looks to finally have found some kind of rhythm, and Arizona’s defense simply doesn’t look like it has the firepower to slow that down in any way. The Trojans should be able to put a lot of points on the board with their vast arsenal of playmakers, especially if the offensive line performs as it did against Washington State. 
The Wildcat rushing offense is dynamic and will likely break some big plays on the night, but look for the Trojan pass rush to rebound from their last showing and make life hard for Tate. Expect this game to be relatively close, but for the Trojans to pull away during the second half.

This week of college football is incredibly important for USC. This weekend’s matchups could easily set the Trojans up for a New Year’s Six Bowl. Looking at the remainder of the schedule, USC may find a Rose Bowl berth at the end of the season. Although that sounds ludicrous, especially since this team has shown little to no signs of consistency through the first four games of the season, it is actually very possible.
Everyone knows that the Pac-12 South isn’t good at football. Realistically, there are two teams that could win the southern half of the conference: USC and Arizona State. These two teams will go head to head at the end of October, and I have a feeling that game will decide the Pac-12 South’s championship representative. 
But back to the reason this weekend is so important: First, USC is coming off a very important win over Washington State. A win over Arizona will set USC up for a long winning streak over Colorado and Utah before it plays in the crucial matchup against the Sun Devils. However, it is a road game, something USC has struggled with conquering this season. 
The second important matchup on Saturday is Stanford vs. Notre Dame. If USC makes it to the Pac-12 championship, the Trojans will most likely face Washington or Stanford. It’s not out of the question for USC to best either of these elite teams. For one, I think the Trojans are more than capable of limiting the Cardinal offense. They held senior running back Bryce Love and sophomore quarterback KJ Costello to just 17 points earlier this season. Once freshman quarterback JT Daniels and co. figure things out, this team should be able to score more than 17 points on Stanford. 
USC fans should root for the Cardinal this weekend for two reasons: The Trojans want to see No. 7 Cardinal again, and No. 7 Stanford is playing No. 8 Notre Dame. A victory would establish them as an elite team to be considered for the College Football Playoff. With all of the upsets lately, I think it is entirely possible that the Cardinal could squeak out a top-four seed before the end of the season. This would be the best case scenario for the Trojans.
If USC enters the Pac-12 Championship against Stanford given the aforementioned circumstances, there is no way the Trojans won’t find a Rose Bowl berth. If USC wins, they will somehow be the champions of the Pac-12 and face the best team in the Big Ten. However, if the Trojans lose, it will only further establish Stanford’s seeding, thereby making it ineligible for a Rose Bowl appearance as the team will be playing in the playoff, leaving USC as the second-best team in the Pac-12.
This is all hypothetical and by no means do I expect the Cardinal to be a playoff team, but it isn’t impossible. 
Back to USC: Excuses are no longer valid this week. I’m getting tired of hearing Daniels and his receivers talk about the chemistry not being there. I understand that the Mater Dei alumnus has played with freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown for several years and feels comfortable with him. However, we are now in the fifth week of the season. It is time that Daniels starts feeling comfortable with receivers junior Michael Pittman Jr. and redshirt sophomores Tyler Vaughns and Velus Jones Jr. 
The win over Washington State showcased the improved chemistry between the receivers and quarterback, but this chemistry must be perfected before USC faces Arizona State. If this happens, USC should have no problem running the table, — with the exception of Notre Dame — and finish the season with a 9-3 record (as I predicted at the start of the season).
A convincing win this week will work wonders for the team’s morale. If this game can serve as a model for how USC should play football, the Trojans won’t have a problem going on a seven-game winning streak, securing a Pac-12 championship berth and possibly finding a way to beat Stanford, if not back their way into a Rose Bowl appearance.
