In their first home game back from their three-game road trip, the Trojans went back to their winning ways by triumphing over the visiting Washington State Cougars 81-71 Thursday night in the Galen Center. Now 12-0 in front of the home crowd, this win marks its best start at home since USC’s 1943 campaign when they went 13-0.
The Trojans’ performance against the Cougars was not a statement game, but rather a reinstatement game after the Men of Troy dropped two straight to Oregon and Oregon State.
The Trojan offense was led by redshirt junior Katin Reinhardt who shot six for 12 from the field and 3 for 8 from beyond the arch to finish the night with 18 of the Trojans’ 81 points, putting him over 1,000 career points. Reinhardt’s 18 points were good enough to set a new career high for the guard.
Washington State came out of the starting blocks with standout play from their big man Ike Iroegbu who tallied eight of Washington State’s first 16 points, finishing the contest with 21 points, six assists and three rebounds on 46.7 percent shooting.
USC head coach Andy Enfield commented on the Cougars’ offensive efficiency and outstanding shooting percentage in comparison to his Trojans.
“I thought Washington State did a great job in the first half of making tough shots. A lot of times at the end of the shot clock, they made a lot of contested shots. Even though both teams were scoring a lot, I thought our defense was solid,” Enfield said.
A resurgent Nikola Jovanovic shot 6 for 10 from the field and ended the night with 12 points.
Despite great defense from the Trojans, the Cougars shot admirably from the floor, knocking down 25 of their 55 shots from the field.
The game was fairly tight throughout the majority of the first half, with the lead changing multiple times in the first half. Not to mention, the physicality of both teams could be felt in the first half with 22 combined fouls being called on both teams.
Eventually the Trojans grabbed the lead, thanks to their three-point shooting, as guards Elijah Stewart and Katin Reinhardt connected on four consecutive shots.
By the end of 20 minutes, USC held a 11-point lead on Washington State despite the Cougars’ 55.2 percent shooting overall.
Though USC featured seven players with six or more points and a 58.6 overall shooting percentage, they only completed 14 of their 22 first-half free-throw shots, missing eight potential points.
These mistakes were overshadowed, though, by their ball distribution and rebounding efforts. In the first half alone, Julian Jacobs contributed six of the Trojans’ 12 assists and the Men of Troy outrebounded the Cougars 13-12.
The beginning of the second half was more of the same for USC as the Trojans took their biggest lead eight minutes into the second half after a pair of free throws by Metu, which gave USC a 70-54 advantage.
The difference in the second half of play was a combination of USC’s shut-down defense and Washington State’s inconsistent shooting from the floor. To end the night, the Trojans totaled eight steals and forced 13 Washington State turnovers.
Not to mention, the Cougars shot just 36 percent in the final 20 minutes, with first-half performer Ike Iroegbu shooting one of three, scoring just five points while the rest of the squad scored just 25.
In terms of the Trojans’ offense, the second half saw an initial scoring flurry, with USC taking a 64-51 advantage on Jordan McLaughlin’s first field goal of the game, a 3-pointer.
With 12 minutes left, though, USC’s offense started to slump as Washington State went on a 10-1 run and brought the Trojans’ lead to just six points. The Cougars’ resurgence in the second half of play could be attributed to their 3-point shooting as well as some ill-timed Trojan turnovers.
Eventually, the Men of Troy’s scoring prowess returned as in the final four minutes, thanks to key buckets from McLaughlin and Metu.
By the end of the contest, the Trojans tallied five double-digit scorers with an overall field goal percentage of 46.6 percent.
Albeit unranked, the Trojans improve their record to 16-5 on the season with a 5-3 record in Pac-12 play. On the other hand, the Cougars were handed their sixth straight loss in Pac-12 play.
Katin Reinhardt commented on USC’s future moving forward after Thursday night’s win despite losing their national ranking.
“The whole preseason we worked our butts off trying to get that recognition we deserve. To see that ranking on the TV and that ranking next to our name meant a lot and we lost it,” Reinhardt said. “We know what type of basketball team we are. Today was a step in the right direction. Now we just got to keep pushing forward.”
USC’s next game will be at Galen Center this Saturday as the 16-5 Trojans take on the 14-6 Washington Huskies at noon.

While USC basketball is in the midst of its best season in recent memory, one that even saw them ranked in the AP Top 25 for the first time since 2008, the end of this campaign still hangs in the balance.
What happened almost immediately after the Trojans received a coveted spot in the rankings? They lost consecutive road games to Oregon and Oregon State last weekend and subsequently fell out of the Top 25. That’s not to say the Ducks and Beavers aren’t quality opponents — Oregon is ranked No. 23 and Oregon State was 9-3 at home entering last Sunday’s game — but these were winnable games for the Men of Troy that would have helped solidify their place among the Pac-12 elites.
Instead, the Trojans found themselves in the middle of the pack in a very tight conference, with the top six teams separated by just one game and Cal and UCLA — both underperforming this season — lurking.
Rather than being the underdog — as they have often been in conference games — USC served as the Goliath in both games last weekend. “Oregon Men’s Basketball upsets No. 21 USC Trojans 89-81” was the headline in the Daily Emerald last Thursday. On Sunday, The Oregonian called the Beavers’ 85-70 win over the Trojans “their signature win of the season.”
With strong performance comes higher expectations, and the Trojans last weekend found themselves in a position they were not accustomed to: being the hunted instead of the hunter, having the target on their backs instead of holding the bow and arrow. Typically, “upsets” and “signature win” are words used to describe USC’s victories over conference opponents — not the other way around. It serves as a reminder as to how quickly times have change for the Trojans. Remember, this team had a 23-41 overall and 5-31 conference record over the last two seasons and it could only pride itself on a few signature wins each season.
Now, the Men of Troy have undoubtedly moved beyond that point and are focusing on bigger and brighter goals — finishing among the top in the Pac-12, earning a trip to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2011, perhaps even making some noise in March Madness. But in order to do so, it is paramount that they end up on the right side of the crossroads they currently sit at.
The rest of the season can go one of two ways. Either the Trojans learn from their mistakes in Oregon and keep knocking off quality conference opponents or they relapse into the team we’re all too familiar with: the young and inexperienced group that fails to finish games and can’t buy a conference win.
Junior guard Julian Jacobs, who has been through many trials and tribulations in his career, knows that fast-paced offense and flashy dunks that have led some to refer to the team as “Slam City” are exciting, but believes the “defense wins championships” maxim rings true. USC struggled defensively in last weekend’s losses to the Oregon schools.
“Defense has to be our top priority,” Jacobs said. “If we let our offense dictate our defense, then this team isn’t going to be very good. But if we go out and guard and play defense like we know we can, we’re just as good as anyone.”
Establishing an identity as a defense-oriented team will demonstrate maturity and growth for a group that has finally grasped tangible success after years of having only hope and potential. Whether that success is short-lived or long-term remains to be seen.
A comfortable victory over Washington State Thursday night is a good start toward the latter, though a win over a last-place Cougars squad coming in on a five-game losing streak is less impressive than it would have seemed before the season.
The bigger test will come on Saturday in a matinee at the Galen Center against Washington, which entered Thursday’s game against UCLA tied for first with Oregon with a conference record of 5-2. Remember, the Trojans blew a 22-point second half lead against the Huskies in Seattle earlier this month and cannot have a repeat occurrence at home tomorrow.
“Against these Washington teams, we definitely want to come out and make a statement. We feel it’s more than a must-win,” Jacobs said prior to the win over the Cougars. “We want to come out and have a pretty convincing statement on our home court.”
One down, many more to go. The Men of Troy have already shattered expectations with their meteoric rise from bottom-feeder to relevance, but in order to truly be taken seriously as strong basketball program on the rise in a football-dominant school, they must finish off the latter half of the season the same way they started it.

Late January isn’t typically thought of as the ideal time for a swim — current water temperatures in Santa Monica are hovering around 60 degrees, but that isn’t keeping a certain group of elite swimmers out of the pool this weekend. Over the next two days, the USC women’s swimming team will compete against No. 2 Stanford and No. 7 California for the right to be called the best in the Golden State.
The No. 5 Women of Troy (6-1, 4-0 Pac-12) are looking to sweep this weekend heading into their final regular season meet against No. 19 UCLA (6-1, 3-1 Pac-12), who will also face Stanford and Cal this weekend. This season, the USC team has been led by co-captains Kendyl Stewart and Lucy Worrall, both seniors who will be competing in their final career home meets.
Saturday’s meet against No. 2 Stanford (4-0, 4-0) will be preceded by a ceremony honoring 10 USC seniors, including Stewart and Worrall. Kasia Wilk, Brianna Weinstein, Joanna Stenkvist and Nikki Chang are the other seniors competing for the last time at home, while Sam Adams, Natalie Kalibat, Jacqui Suitt and Katherine Van Winkle will be honored as senior divers.
Tonight’s matchup against No. 7 California (5-0, 4-0) will feature some of the top athletes in the Pac-12, including Bears senior, Rachel Bootsma, who is a two-time champion in the 100y backstroke and ranks fifth in the nation this year for it. Senior co-captain Elizabeth Pelton is a star in her own right, currently ranked in the top 10 in five different events.
The Cardinal are currently undefeated, and the Women of Troy haven’t beaten them in a meet since 1996. The Cardinal swimmers are versatile and dominant; sophomore Janet Hu, junior Lia Neal, senior Sarah Haase and freshman Ella Eastin all own more than one national top 15 ranking. Haase and Eastin each have the top national ranking in the 100y breast and the 400y individual medley respectively .
The team currently boasts eight different swimmers in the national top 20, with some of them holding top 20 rankings in more than one event. Juniors Anika Apostalon, Chelsea Chenault and sophomore Hannah Weiss each have two top 20 rankings, while freshman Kirsten Vose currently claims a top 20 spot in three different events: the 200y breast, the 100y breast and the 200y individual medley. As a team, the Women of Troy are ranked third in the 400y free relay and medley relay, fourth in the 800y free relay, seventh in the 200y free relay, eleventh in the 200y medley relay.
The meet against Cal will begin at 6 p.m. on Friday at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center and Senior Day will begin at noon on Saturday.

The No. 4 women’s tennis team will continue their season with two matches at home over the weekend. They will face No. 18 Pepperdine on Friday and No. 47 Saint Mary Saturday.
The Women of Troy are looking to build on last week’s 4-3 win against UC Santa Barbara.
“We’ll have to relax and … play,” head coach Richard Gallien said. “Last match we came out of the blocks slowly.”
At doubles, No. 4 Giuliana Olmos and Gabby Smith are aiming to get their first win of the season under their belt, while freshman Jessica Failla and junior Zoe Katz are hoping to repeat their winning performance from last Wednesday, where they won four games in a row after being down 2-4 to win the only doubles match of the day for the Trojans.
In singles, the Women of Troy has five seeded players — No. 42 Giuliana Olmos, No. 48 Rianna Valdes, No. 49 Madison Westby, No. 76 Jessica Failla and No. 114 Zoe Katz. Smith and  sophomore Meredith Xepoleas also made their season debut last week at second and sixth singles respectively, with Xepoleas clinching the match in three sets.
“They are a very good team, probably the best in the past 16 years,” Gallien said of the Pepperdine team. “But our girls are keen. It’s going to be a challenge for everybody, but our girls are keen.”
The Waves have a record of 1-1. At singles, they will rely on three seeded players: freshman Luisa Stefani at No. 14 is the best ranked player, followed by freshman Dzina Milovanovic at No. 96 and sophomore Laura Gulbe at No. 102.
The Waves are going to try to keep their nearly undefeated record going on the doubles side. The Women of Troy have a 44-12 all-time record against Pepperdine. The last home meet finished 4-0 for in favor of USC.
The Women of Troy will take on No. 47 Saint Mary on Saturday. The Gaels are coming off of a 4-0 win against Cal State Northridge in the consolation match of the ITA Kick-Off weekend. They previously had lost 4-1 to Washington. Their key player is senior Jamie Pawid, currently the only one ranked nationally at No. 103. USC has an all-time record of 5-0 in previous encounters. The last meeting was last season, with the final score of 5-2 for the Women of Troy.
Matches begin at 1:00 p.m. on Friday and noon on Saturday at Marks Stadium.

Gretchen Dahlinger Means, formerly serving as an expert for sexual assault and complex litigation in the United States Marine Corps, was appointed as the executive director of the Office of Equity and Diversity and USC’s Title IX Coordinator Thursday.
The decision was announced in a memorandum sent out on by Todd Dickey, the senior vice president for administration.
Means’ job will include “[leading] our compliance and training efforts related to Title IX, the Violence Against Women Act and equal opportunity and affirmative action regulatory requirements,” Dickey said in the memorandum.
In the Marine Corps, Means served primarily in the Western Region. She established domestic violence and sexual assault protocols that are now implemented nationwide across the Corps.
Additionally, she has experience in training lawyers and others in legal professions.
Means will supervise investigations into reported incidents of harassment and discrimination based on protected characteristics cited in the USC Codes of Conduct.
Means, who has a background in the legal profession as a deputy district attorney in San Diego, earned her J.D. from the UC Hastings College of Law.
Means will be working primarily with Dickey, as well as with Janis McEldowney, the associate senior vice president for human resources.
This announcement comes in the midst of an ongoing federal Title IX investigation that was launched at USC in 2013.

In an effort to spread awareness on environmental issues and current attempts to address them by talking about the recent climate summit COP21, the Environmental Student Assembly hosted USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Dean Steven Lamy, Shannon Gibson, a professor in international relations, and the USC Schwarzenegger Institute Global Director Bonnie Reiss Thursday afternoon.
The talks began with background about COP21 and the concept of global warming as a whole. Held in Paris shortly after the November terrorist attacks, COP21 addressed the issue of climate change and how different countries and communities could reduce carbon emissions. It was the 21st of a series of meetings following the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on climate control and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Talks at the summit centered around not letting the average global temperature rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius and countries constructing goals for lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
After explaining the purpose of the meeting, the speakers delved into the implications concerning the standards that each country set up in order to decrease carbon emissions.
“This is like Weight Watchers, people come in and make promises but the enforcement mechanism is not there,” Lamy said. “There is going to be smaller countries that will be leaders in reducing carbon emissions like Sweden or Norway.”
Lamy explained that more skeptical countries like Russia could look to these “leader” countries to mold their policies, reducing emissions yet boosting their economies.
Reiss echoed this sentiment by saying the lack of global enforcement to hold these countries accountable poses a challenge for the world.
“The problem seems to be that there is no enforcing programs that will make these ‘intended commitments’ come true,” Reiss said. “This issue is still in the hands of nation states. We have not yet decided on a system of global governance.”
She followed this up by stating that the consumer has the most power by choosing to support or not support corporations that aren’t environmentally friendly.
“Individuals should divest from companies that contribute lots of emissions,” Reiss said.
She then transitioned into her talks about how spreading environmental awareness should begin on a microscale. She stated that despite its difficulty, it’s important that the U.S. effectively convey the severity of the issue to its citizens.
“In a country like the United States, anything complicated is avoided,” Reiss said. “We need to communicate in a way that is more relevant to people and voters.”
Gibson added to this argument by stating that students should be critical consumers, buying products based on background research and figuring out how much of an impact it actually makes on the environment. She talked about how green symbols on many big company products are actually industry markings that have low standards and mean next to nothing.
Reiss brought it back to the USC students by urging the those in attendance to be smart consumers.
“The kind of transition it’s going to take for a low-carbon system is going to be huge,” Reiss said. “But it begins with your generation — you guys.”

The USC Hyperloop team has been staying busy trying to perfect their presentation for the judges at the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Design Competition at Texas A&M University this weekend.
The SpaceX Hyperloop competition is a significant milestone in the race to make Hyperloop — a conceptual high speed transit system that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk calls a potential “fifth mode of transport” — an increasingly believable reality. Three years ago, when Musk released a whitepaper on the SpaceX website that outlined plans for a revolutionary new transit system, many believed that it was an idea out of science fiction that would not see the light of day for generations to come.
The Hyperloop is a 28-passenger pod that rides on a cushion of air inside a vacuum sealed tube and can reach a top speed of 760 miles/hour. This means that the 6-hour drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco will take no longer than 30 minutes in a pod that has been pressurized to limit the effect of G-forces so that the journey will be as comfortable as flight.
Multiple startups have amassed millions of dollars in investments for the sole purpose of creating the world’s first functioning Hyperloop.
So, when SpaceX announced a competition to design and build a half-scale Hyperloop system, more than 100 student engineering teams from 20 countries responded.
Last November, USC Hyperloop was not only invited to present their designs at the SpaceX Design Weekend starting this Saturday, but also nominated to try out their finished pods on the SpaceX Hyperloop track during the final competition in June this year.
The 24-person team was formed by Alexander Declue, a sophomore majoring in astronautical engineering. Declue started his research as soon as the competition was announced last June. Declue said he was attracted by the innovative concept of Hyperloop.
“High efficiency, low costs and blazingly fast speeds,” Declue said.
Declue said his team is also driven by its belief in the project.
“Our team is somewhat unique because this is an extracurricular activity for all of our members,” Declue said. “Our members choose to work on this project because they are adamant believers in the concept and crave the hands-on, fast-paced engineering experience that these competitions offer.”
As with any extracurricular, he recalls that his biggest challenge as project manager was to find students that were skilled and committed to the project. Declue said the project leads meet three to four times a week and communicate constantly.
After months of intense work, the team will finally learn if their designs are among the strongest at the competition at Texas A&M Friday and Saturday. Hyperloop Technologies Inc. even upped the ante when they recently announced that they would offer $150,000 in prize money to the teams with the strongest designs.
For Declue and his team, the money would be a validation of their efforts and would mean that they would not need to crowdfund to meet their budget goals for their prototype pod construction.
The finished Hyperloop system is estimated to cost  $6 billion, a fraction of the $68 billion that the state has pledged to the development of the high-speed rail system.
Declue said he counts himself lucky to have found a team of such great people. Though the current team exists only to compete in the SpaceX competition, if there is demand, he would be more than willing to take on a new project next year.
The SpaceX Design Weekend will take place from Jan. 29-30 at Texas A&M University.

The L.A. Art Show had its Opening Night Premiere Party on Jan. 27 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The evening served as a fundraiser for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, with a majority of ticket proceeds being donated to the charity.
Founded in 1994, the L.A. Art Show has expanded to become one of the largest running platforms for modern and contemporary art. The evening was hosted by Academy Award-winning actress Anne Hathaway and spouse Adam Shulman. The evening’s attendees also included celebrities such as actors James Franco and Michael Douglas and actress Alia Shawkat, among others.
The L.A. Art Show is essentially an enormous art fair held in the West Hall of the L.A. Convention Center. Now in its 22nd year, this year’s exhibitions include 79 galleries, many of which travelled internationally to participate.
The evening featured an eclectic array of modern and contemporary art. Some notable exhibitions include a performance piece by L.A.-based British performance artist Millie Brown, who has previously made headlines for her collaboration with pop star Lady Gaga. Brown’s piece featured at this year’s show, “Wilting Point,” exhibits Brown lying among a bed of fresh, brightly colored flowers and immersing herself in a “meditative state where she [focuses] on the beauty of the external decomposition around her,” according to the gallery’s website.
In Brown’s own words, the performance piece “is an exploration of the transience of life. The intention is to eliminate all the distractions of daily reality, in order to focus on the impermanence and fragile beauty of our existence.” What proved to be most provocative about Brown’s piece is her tenacity; abstaining from food, Brown will survive only on water for the duration of the exhibit. Indeed, it was mesmerizing to watch Brown so deeply resolved in this element.
Also featured in the show was a Kazuhiro Tsuji piece titled “Frida Kahlo,” an eerily realistic mixed-media statue of famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.
Aesthetically, Tsuji strives to move beyond the colloquial likeliness of his life-like pieces. On his website, Tsuji wrote, “I create these heads from the inside out, bringing to life the appearance of inner thought and emotion as I layer the silicone.”
The statue features a bust of Kahlo’s head held upright in the palms of two hands. The mediums used to create this piece include platinum silicone, resin, composite metal and human hair. The piece proved to be an early crowd favorite, and was one of the most popular pieces of the night.
Also worth mentioning were the works of South Korean painter Tae Hee Kim, who displayed a series of erotic yet sensitively detailed paintings involving genitalia and intercourse.  Her pieces were among the most beautiful and skillfully created paintings of the evening.
The L.A. Art Show runs through Jan. 31. More information regarding hours and participating galleries can be found online.

Mamma Mia!, the hit Broadway sensation, rolled into the Pantages Theatre Tuesday, bringing the high energy songs of the band ABBA with it. The show will be running at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre from Jan. 26, through Jan. 31, a short run that’s not too unusual for a show that comes back almost every year to Los Angeles. USC’s Undergraduate Student Government Program Board’s Performing Arts Committee and Special Events Committee took a group of 40 students to see the performance, providing a night of dancing, singing along and great vibes with hit songs such as “Super Trouper,” “Lay All Your Love on Me,” “Honey, Honey,” “Dancing Queen” and, of course, “Mamma Mia.”
The feel-good show tells the story of Sophie’s quest to discover who her father is from three men in her mother’s past, all of which takes place on her wedding night on a small island in Greece. The three men, Harry, Sam and Bill, have no idea that they have a child and simply believe that they were invited to a wedding. However, they soon learn that they’ve been brought back to Greece for another, very unexpected reason: their potential daughter.
The show began with a hilarious fair warning that it contained spandex and platform shoes, and a killer introductory number introducing the plot and the main characters, Sophie and her mother Donna, but with some contemporary twists. Sophie, played by Kyra Belle Johnson, quickly won our hearts with her mischievous determination to discover who her real father is while at the same displaying her incredible pipes. Donna, played by Erin Fish, owned the show and the protagonist role. While the movie has Sophie as the main character, it quickly becomes clear that this is Donna’s story, which is a clever shift as many theater goers were older and could connect better with the mother. The audience sees Donna’s inner struggle when she discovers that her lovers from the past are back with her hysterical take on the song “Mamma Mia,” which is only heightened by a brilliant use of lighting to isolate what is happening in her mind.
Though Sophie and Donna were amazing characters played by two extremely talented women, Donna’s best friends Tanya and Rosie, played by Laura Michelle Hughes and Sarah Smith respectfully, actually stole the show. From the moment they stepped on the stage they had the crowd captivated, making the audience laugh with their careful gestures and quirks and their show stopping number, “Dancing Queen,” which had audience members singing, clapping and dancing along. Both confident, strong women captured the stage, both with their own numbers, “Does Your Mother Know” and “Take A Chance On Me,” making audiences wish that they were the protagonists of the musical.
Furthermore, the entire production of the musical was simple but effective, using many palettes of cooler colors, beautiful arrays of gobo lighting and minimalistic set pieces. Though at some points the vocals were muffled, overall, the show sounded great and got the audience on their feet. Likewise, the lighting design was strikingly fantastic, utilizing spots to draw focus to parts of the stage and creating dramatic tones in others. The show captured everything from a creepy dream that featured fog and sickly green, as well as an upbeat disco dance party.
As every show should, Mamma Mia! ended with a standing ovation and dancing to a high-energy number of ABBA’s greatest hits, “Mamma Mia,” and “Dancing Queen.” The show left audiences with a smile on their faces and songs in their heads, and even though the plot itself wasn’t the most complex, the show’s music, characters and production made it a show worth singing about.

Flashback to the Land Rover battling the wind as it drove from the bright lights of L.A. into the cold night of Mammoth Mountain. The wind beat against the covering in a way that reminded me of some of Skrillex’s more disorganized works. The stereo was cranked up to its highest volume to try and out-roar the thundering road noise. I was placed in charge of DJ-ing the long drive.
People in the process of getting to know me often struggle to label my musical taste. I can talk about my favorite guitar heroes of the ’60s, beloved girl groups from the ’40s, Australian rap, political hip-hop, current glam rock and punk with such fervor that it comes as a surprise when I fawn over popstars like Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez. I love it all. Yes, even country. So you can only imagine how sporadic and varied my DJ set was as I controlled the phone and how confused the poor soul driving was as she listened.
By the second or third hour, my driving companion -— who had only known me for a few weeks — made a noise as if the punchline of a joke she’d been told earlier finally clicked. She turned to me and said, “I get it now. I get what your music taste is.” I raised my eyebrows and asked her to elaborate. “Sincerity. You like music that’s sincere.”
I smiled as I pressed play on the next song and pondered what she had said.
Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t an epiphany for me as much as it was for her. I’d always known the music that resonated with me most was the music that seemed authentic, but I started wondering why that was. Everyone loves to relate to what we consume, but how did I find this sincerity I related to in so many different styles and genres?
I thought back to the first time I ever had a musical experience; to the first time a song hit me as more than just a melody, but as an actual coherent message. My dad played “Lost in the Supermarket” by The Clash. I just remember looking at my dad and saying, “Yeah! This!” The simplistically technical ability paired with Joe Strummer’s subtle, raw vocals created a song that went beyond being lyrics and a tune to become this personal moment I shared with four guys I had never met.
To me, sincere music is a song or an album that you relate to not because it reminds you of a feeling you’ve had, but because it gives you a feeling complete in and of itself, regardless of whether you’ve had it. Let me explain what I mean: “Thank You” by Led Zeppelin is a great example. I’ve never been in love. The time I first heard the song, I’d never even been in a relationship, but it quickly became a song I related to passionately. Singer Robert Plant sings a love song that broke grown men’s hearts and here I was, a prepubescent teen — yeah, I bloomed late — identifying in a similar fashion. When I listened to the song, I wasn’t listening because it reminded me of a specific crush or because I’d been through the same thing; I was listening because Plant sang in a way that evoked a feeling of tragic beauty. And I knew that feeling well. It wasn’t his voice or Jimmy Page’s guitar skills, it wasn’t the percussion or the bass. It was an entire emotion wrapped up and placed neatly in my headphones just for me.
Music has come a long way and it has further to go. There’s rarely an entirely unique song anymore. One Direction borrows from the Who, 5 Seconds of Summer borrows from Duran Duran and Nicki Minaj borrows from old slavery songs. Electronic music is constantly innovating and new sounds and techniques entice the generation, but when it comes to making stars, it’s about what’s real. It’s not genre — as much as hipsters like to claim it is — it’s authenticity. From Adele to Kurt Cobain, the musicians we love to hold on to are the ones who pour their hearts and souls into what they make. The beloved conductor Leonard Bernstein once said “music just is.” I’ll go one step further — sincere music just is. It’s not broken down into its components or its message. It just is the feeling as the music vibrates through your skin. It just is the emotions evoked into your chest. It just is the connection that you find, for those brief, few minutes with the sound pumping in your ears. Music just is.

The Women of Troy were able to snap a three-game losing streak with a win against Cal on Sunday and look to continue their success this weekend as they hit the road to play Utah and Colorado.  A set of victories this weekend is vital to the team’s Pac-12 standing, and its momentum entering the second half of the season.
The team starts off the weekend in Utah (12-7, 4-4) against a struggling Utes team.  Utah has been struggling to score as of late and this is likely to continue against a stingy USC defense that has limited opponents to 55.7 points and 38.5% shooting.  In order to slow down the Utes, USC (15-5, 3-5) will need to try and limit sophomore center Emily Potter, who is currently averaging 16.7 points per game.
“We’re going to double [Potter] and try to keep the ball out of her hands,” head coach Cynthia-Cooper Dyke said.
Utah currently sits right above USC in the Pac-12 standings at 4-4; however, they come into the game struggling.  After starting conference play 4-1, Utah is currently on a three-game losing streak with losses against No. 8 Arizona State, No. 9 Oregon State and Oregon by an average margin of 13.6.  A win against Utah will place USC into a tie for sixth in the conference.
The team then travels to Boulder on Sunday to play a Colorado (5-14, 0-8) team that has struggled this season. Colorado is currently on a nine-game losing streak and may not seem as much of a challenge to USC; however, the Women of Troy can not take any game for granted at this point of the season.
“It’s important to not take this game lightly because Colorado is a strong team,” Cooper-Dyke said. “Every team in the Pac-12 is strong this year, no matter what their record is.”
The player to watch this weekend is junior guard Courtney Jaco.  After a tough weekend in Washington in which she shot 3/24 from deep, Jaco was able to bounce back this past weekend shooting four-of-five from distance.  Her three-point shooting is crucial to a team that needs spacing in order for star player Temi Fagbenle to operate effectively.  If Jaco is able to shoot from deep effectively this weekend, it will make it much easier for Fagbenle and Kristen Simon to score inside the paint.
USC has been missing starters Brianna Barrett and Jordan Adams for the past four games and hope to have them back soon.  The team has gone 1-3 the past four games with both players missing and the team has been missing their leadership, play-making, and versatility.  Jordan Adams’ ability to play and defend multiple positions along with Barrett’s play-making ability is vital to this team’s success.
“I can’t wait to get them back. I wish we had them on this four-game road trip,” Cooper-Dyke said.
In order to come out of this weekend victorious, the Women of Troy will need to continue to rely on their defense.  USC has wrecked havoc on opponents this season with their stout defense and it will need to continue to do that in order to defeat Utah and Colorado this weekend.

With another Undergraduate Student Government election season underway, students will once again have the opportunity to elect the next generation of student leaders — leaders who will be tasked with serving the student body through their platforms, initiatives and resolutions.
But this year’s USG elections will feature important voices that have been absent from previous elections: current student government leaders themselves. Unlike past elections in which USG members were barred from supporting any presidential, vice presidential or senatorial candidate, this year’s election will be the first to allow USG members to publicly support those who they believe will best serve the student body. This amendment to USG’s election bylaws marks an important shift in the election process and the role USG members and endorsements play in ensuring that the best candidates get the recognition they deserve.
As student leaders, USG members have a responsibility to use their understanding of student government and the individuals working within it to make the best endorsements possible. These endorsements not only serve as a sign of support, but they can also give voice and recognition to candidates who might not otherwise have it — particularly those without traditional organizational ties often present in the student government community or those lacking visibility on campus due to any number of factors. Allowing those who best know the functions and needs of USG to voice their support for a particular candidate provides valuable information to student voters, who may otherwise only vote based on name recognition.
Last semester saw one of USG’s most engaged semesters, with students bringing forward resolutions addressing topics including diversity, mental health and college affordability. As the student body continues to address these pertinent issues, it is imperative that we have student leaders who are willing to champion campus causes that represent the entire student body. Endorsing diverse candidates who truly represent a cross-section of the campus community is vital to ensuring that everyone’s voice is heard.
Though endorsements from current USG members could create an election system that favors insiders, an endorsement is limited enough to still allow for a fair and equal election. Current members will still not be able to formally work on candidate’s campaigns, and the election process will otherwise be unchanged regarding rules for campaigning and the amount of coverage each candidate is allowed. An endorsement from a USG member simply offers more information to students trying to choose a candidate — if a voter believes a certain member of USG has done a good job, they can use that representative’s endorsement to point them toward a candidate they might otherwise overlook.
Just as student government leaders have a responsibility to use their experience to inform the student body of who they think will best serve our campus, we too recognize the important role we as a publication play. As the University’s only newspaper of record, we hold ourselves accountable for informing our readers and encouraging them to support candidates who will bring positive change to our student government. We look forward to getting to know each of the candidates over the course of this election season before coming to our decision. We hope our endorsement will serve as a starting point for students’ own research about who they believe is best fit to lead our campus next fall.

Biting political commentary has dogged Hillary Clinton’s campaign since its inception last year. “I know why I lost [in 2008],” said Saturday Night Live’s Kate McKinnon during her iconic impression of Hillary. “I was running against a cool black guy. But [now] I thought I got to be the cool black guy.”
The 2008 election saw one of the largest turnouts of millennial voters in history — 66 percent of young voters cast their ballot for Obama.  Now, like in 2008, the Clinton campaign faces its age-old problem: a lack of appeal to young voters. According to the Harvard Institute of Politics, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is beating Clinton 41 percent to 35 percent among Democratic millennials. Sanders runs an admirable campaign — marked by an authentic grassroots feel, a rebellious denial of the existing political elite, dreamy economic promises and a well-meaning candidate. But Clinton, both on the merit of her past success and the feasibility of her platform, deserves much more consideration by the millennial crowd than it currently receives.
Hillary Clinton is running a practical, visionary and historically important campaign. Though Sanders has largely dominated the young vote, Clinton’s platform, policies and political acumen warrant consideration both for her ability to enact meaningful change as well as her practicality in the face of a largely partisan Congress and heated international climate. But whether she can earn the respect of college voters will largely depend on her success in reaching them.
It’s easy to see why young voters aren’t quite Ready for Hillary — and it’s largely because of the appeal of her Democratic opponent. To be fair, everybody loves a guy who shows up swallowed by an oversized blazer, ready to shed pleasantries and start exposing lies and identifying the “real problems” — he’ll even do it off-the-cuff in a well-meaning Brooklyn accent. However, millennials largely overlook the viability of Sanders’ platform, the feasibility of his promises, the partisan nature of Congress, his ability to legislate from the Oval Office or the reach of his political allies. Even so, Sanders has polled at 60 percent of voters 45 years of age and younger in both Iowa and New Hampshire. If young voters turn out in numbers anywhere close to Obama’s in 2008, the Clinton campaign must keep up.
Further hurting the Clinton campaign is the shallow disappointment that the face of the campaign simply doesn’t compare well to the angry, home-grown college professor. Clinton comes off as an old dog from the political elite, lacks “cool” appeal and appears eerily calculated.
But if anyone’s aware of this fact, it’s Hillary 2016. In order to better connect with the millennial crowd, they have put forward a commendable effort. Hilariously enough, one of the first things that helped Clinton’s numbers with the young crowd was getting a Snapchat. This old dog can learn new tricks — like when to use the word “chillin’” and the social standards surrounding the fist-bump. Clinton’s social media presence has grown tremendously as compared to her last run in ’08. After all, she’s 68 and still uses a Blackberry. Her job for the last eight years has been serving the American people — she’s not exactly an Instagram model.
Perhaps most importantly, Clinton has been able to effectively connect with younger voters by doing what CNN described as playing the “gender card” — reminding young voters of the historical importance of her campaign. If anything appeals to college liberal voters, it is the immediate necessity of equality and the breakdown of institutions that oppose these goals — after all, it’s with these sentiments in mind that Sanders has been able to earn the love of millions of young voters. One thing that Clinton offers, which Sanders cannot, is a break in a long line of all-male, predominantly older, 99 percent white presidents. As president, she would embody contemporary goals toward equality.
The bottom line is that Clinton’s campaign platform measures up to Sanders’ exceptionally well on the issues most likely to be addressed — and fixed — by a contemporary Congress. She has a greater propensity to push for the achievement of her campaign promises from the executive branch and has proven herself to be adept at the wheelings and dealings of politics. Her long-time status in the institution allows her to keep meaningful connections and exercise them in the pursuit of her goals. In order to see meaningful change in the next four years, college voters need to consider whether to support a candidate who can back up their promises with legislation. The Clinton campaign has done much to communicate this idea to millennials. We will soon witness whether its efforts prove to be fruitful in Iowa and beyond.

I’m voting BLUE no matter WHO…but I think Bernie Sanders is a better choice across the board for quite a number of reasons. I feel he would do much more to energize the base in the national election which would benefit the down-ticket races far more than HRC would IMHO.
Just goes to show ya that millenials are too young to understand history and the cause and effect of voting for a leftist criminal like Hillary. Most millenials I know and I work in a young persons industry are Bernie fans.  read up on the Cllnton way and you’ll too understand that once a criminal, always a criminal.
Take it you have read nothing, then.   Nice try.  Do you even know the definition of criminal?  You sound like a right winger who blames shooting victims and rape victims for the atrocities committed upon them.

Justin Bieber took the stage at the Staples Center Sunday Night for Calibash 2016. But it was not to kick off his highly anticipated new tour. Rather, the 21-year-old Canadian hit-maker joined Colombian singer J Balvin to perform a Latin version of his chart topper “Sorry,” which they remixed together last year. The mostly Latin audience of 17,000 fans screamed and cried for the pair of entertainers who have been dominating charts and arenas across the globe. 
Bieber looked relaxed as he took the stage to belt out “Sorry,” which recently passed Adele’s “Hello” on the Billboard music charts. The Purpose singer looked as if he had just left a late-night skateboarding session, wearing a camp parka over a black hoodie over a red shirt over a white shirt.  Bright red jeans and sneakers added to the pop singer’s outfit. Co-star J Balvin looked ready for the disco with a shiny baseball jacket. A plaid shirt and ripped jeans completed his grunge ’90s look. 
Calibash has become the leading Latin urban music concert in Los Angeles with more than 135,000 tickets sold since its inception. Celebrating nine editions, Calibash has come a long way since its first show at The Forum in Inglewood, California. Back then, the Latin urban music movement was still finding momentum. 
Flash forward to 2016 and Calibash featured performances from some of the most notable Latin music acts spread across various genres: urban, hip-hop, rap, reggaeton, pop and bachata. Huge market acts such as Chris Brown have previously been featured. He performed in 2013.  This year’s packed lineup included headliner Snoop Dogg, J Balvin, Prince Royce, Nicky Jam, Plan B, Yandel, Farruko, Becky G, J Alvarez, Zion & Lennox, among others. 
Prince Royce, a previous and current Calibash performer, who has toured with acts such as Enrique Iglesias, Jennifer Lopez and Pitbull, pumped up the crowd with an energetic set. The highlight was his performance of “Drop It Like It’s Hot,” featuring Snoop Dogg. Becky G, Lil Jon and Yandel were not left behind, the trio performed for the first time the upcoming single, “Take It Off.” 
The presence of hip-hop and rap acts like Lil Jon and Snoop Dogg represents the Latino audience’s interest for acts beyond the Latin genre. The Latino demographic is represented through listeners of the Los Angeles-based radio station MEGA 96.3 FM, owned by the Spanish Broadcasting System, also producers of Calibash. 
“If you don’t reach Latinos you’re out of business,” said Juan Carlos Hidalgo, SBS’s VP of Programming for the West Coast. 
“For years I’ve had a vision that we can do radio for Latinos who love more than just one genre,” Hidalgo said.
Now, MEGA 96.3 FM and Calibash are part of that idea that allows different types of music to blend in together to offer for a new generation of fans. It was no coincidence Bieber and Balvin chose this event to perform together. 
Balvin walked back to his dressing room receiving various high-fives from his team after his bilingual duet with Bieber, which has become extremely popular in social media. 
“This is history,” he said. “Latinos, arriba.”

My friend and I trekked all the way Downtown to Whole Foods to go grocery shopping Saturday. As we aimlessly wandered from the grains aisle to the condiments aisle, contemplating how to save the most money on gourmet jams, I realized we had absolutely no idea what we were doing.
“Do you think I should get yogurts? What about cheese? Brie or Feta? Oh, pizza bagels!” my friend ran off, distracted, toward the freezers.
“Grocery shopping is so hard!” I replied. “I always buy the unnecessary things that I never even use, like powdered donuts and pickles, but end up forgetting the things I truly need like paper towels and cereal.”
It dawned upon me that this grocery shopping extravaganza serves as a metaphor for so many college students.
From 18 to around 22 years old we are trapped in this little bubble, straddling the worlds between kid and adult.
We are no longer children, always seeming to be about a decade older than all of the patients when we awkwardly still see our pediatricians; but we are most definitely not adults, not able to buy a house or a glass of wine with dinner or even choose the right groceries.
Everyone reminisces so fondly on the college years, but what is this little four-year bubble intended for? How can we grow up when we are trapped between high school prom and the law firm dinner?
We aren’t taken seriously, yet we are expected to do things all on our own.
So many times I have wanted to call my parents, asking for the best home remedy to get a wine stain out of a nice dress or how to get health insurance to waive a bill, but I clench my fists and put my phone back in my pocket, promising myself that I will figure it out on my own.
On the brink of adulthood we are plagued with that odd mix of far too much pride to ask for help, and not enough wisdom to actually know what we are doing.
In reality, it’s so strange that in America at 18 we are suddenly adults, stripped of any lingering pre-pubescent marks and thrown out of the comfort of our homes into a world that is new, strange and entirely ours for the taking.
It is terrifying and exhilarating and wonderful all at the same time.
I was lucky enough to have a childhood where I did not have to grow up too fast. Sometimes, I do miss the comfort of carefully wrapped, diagonally cut peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and knowing my mom would be waiting in the carpool line at 3:15 p.m. on the dot.
But while it can be scary, lonely and strange to be on the brink of adulthood, it should be exhilarating as well.
Maybe the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and clean laundry done by our parents are no longer always waiting for us on the counter, but what is far more exciting is what is waiting for us in the years to come.
So many of us view college as this four-year time warp where everything is suspended and you can do whatever you want without your parents’ nagging or the responsibilities of adulthood.
I like the idea that time can freeze in this sense; unfortunately, that seems a tad unrealistic, but I think maybe it can slow down, and we can use that to our advantage.
Once my friend and I realized we had absolutely no clue what to buy, we sat down and really contemplated which groceries were necessary and which would sit in the back of our pantry for the next five months.
We proceeded to carefully pick out only the necessities, all for under $50 at that.
So maybe as a college student we aren’t always taken seriously. Maybe, no matter how nicely we dress up, we’re not going to look old enough to buy that margarita with dinner. Maybe we buy pickles and donuts and our dirty laundry sits in our rooms for far too long.
Maybe we are still kids at heart and maybe it takes us a while how to figure out how to navigate a swarming adult world full of taxes, insurance plans and loans.
Maybe we are stuck in this bubble where we are slowly figuring it out, but maybe this is exactly where we are supposed to be. Maybe, just maybe, when we are finally released into the world of briefcases and studio apartments, we will be ready.

In their most prolific period — from 1969 to 1975 — Led Zeppelin released six albums. Each album has secured itself a rightful place as a classic in the canons of rock history. The last of these six was Physical Graffiti . Like most mega-bands of the ’70s, Led Zeppelin decided that after reaching incredible heights, their next logical step was to release a double album. Unlike most of those like-minded bands, Zeppelin ended up releasing (another) timeless piece of work.
Physical Graffiti is not Zeppelin’s best work – that distinction falls upon IV; nevertheless, it is the summation of everything beautiful about rock. If aliens came here and demanded we show them “rock music,” we would play them this album. It is epic, grandiose, funky, gnarly, mystical and strange all at once.
Roughly half of Physical Graffiti is composed of new material recorded for the album, with the other half being composed of old cuts that the band felt had to be released. Despite this and the album’s significant length, Graffiti doesn’t feel disjointed. In fact, it feels like Zeppelin’s most comfortable work.
In other words, Physical Graffiti is where Zeppelin completely come into their own, producing tracks that while not (like their previous records) groundbreaking, are unquestionably defined by classic Zeppelin sensibilities. Author Dave Lewis put it best when he described Physical Graffiti as “the definitive summary of [Zeppelin’s] studio work,” creating “an embarrassment of riches.”
Graffiti does this by showcasing each band member’s best qualities. Jimmy Page creates some of his most melodic and memorable riffs. Page, who also produced the record, beautifully layers his lyrical guitar parts in a way that often overwhelms the senses with joy and wonder. “Ten Years Gone” – my favorite Zeppelin song – is one of the album’s best examples of Page’s dedication to guitar artistry. The song swells with a distinctively Zeppelin hook, and progresses into one of the bands’ finest and most touching ballads.
“Houses of the Holy,” on the other hand, is one of the record’s more hard-hitting tracks. And though the track is seemingly a more traditional rock song, its structure is unique, and it is propelled by a groove only John Bonham – the greatest drummer man has ever known – could produce. This is true of all of the album’s less ethereal songs, including the funky “Trampled Under Food” and the frantically wonderful “Wanton Song.”
Speaking of Bonham, he is absolutely astounding on his album. His grooves are deceptively simple and immeasurably important to the success of every song, as is the subtly brilliant bass-playing of John Paul Jones, the other half of Zeppelin’s legendary rhythm section. Jones always finds a way to milk out of his bass riffs magic that no other bassist could produce, marrying Page’s complex guitar patterns with Bonham’s intricate drum phrases.
And of course, no discussion of Physical Graffiti would be complete without mention of the album’s centerpiece – “Kashmir.” Undoubtedly ahead of its time, “Kashmir” embodies the band’s adoration of the mythical. The instrumental is magnificently orchestrated and perfectly extravagant. Singer Robert Plant’s lyrics define the journey, his voice as captivating and matchless as ever. Songs like “Kashmir” and albums like Physical Graffiti are clear reminders of why Zeppelin is a cut above the rest.

You bet they are the Best. Band. Ever.  Unparalleled.  Epic.  Legendary.  
Best band ever!!!

USC Drum Major Chase Wagoner led the Spirit of Troy into the crowd, victoriously waving his hand in the air with a symbolic “Fight On” to formally begin the ceremony celebrating the USC Village construction project hitting its halfway mark Wednesday.
President C.L. Max Nikias spoke about the project — the most ambitious in USC’s history — which will increase the size of the campus by 30 percent. The architects who were present and honored at the ceremony, J. Peter Devereaux and Tania L. Van Herle from the Harley Ellis Devereaux Architectural Firm, aimed to embody a semi-gothic style that they created when designing the Wallis Annenberg Hall.
“After more than one million man hours of design and construction, the USC village has rapidly moved from capturing our imaginations to materializing our hopes for the future of this University but also for the future of our neighborhood,” Nikias said.
There will be 2,700 new student beds within nine residential colleges. Retail spaces will include a 30-thousand- -square-foot fitness center, a Trader Joe’s, restaurants and coffee shops such as a Starbucks, a Bank of America branch, a dry cleaner, a beauty salon and a bike repair shop. Nikias also mentioned how this will change the student living experience beginning in fall of 2017, when the Village is on track to open.
“It will reinvent learning and living, allowing USC to become a fully residential university,” Nikias said. “It will reinvigorate commerce and opportunity, allowing our neighborhood to become a fully realized destination for retail and employment.”
William Marsh, director of Capital Construction, added to the list of benefits of The Village.
“As an alumni here, this is going to be a terrific experience,” Marsh said. “It’s basically an expansion of the campus. You’re going to have a greater body of the students closer together. On campus, all of the dorms are kind of spread out, which is fine, but this will really create a bond for the freshman coming in, particularly with their involvement with each other and interaction with the upperclassmen, all being in this close environment.”
Contrary to rumors around school, The Village is not only freshman living.
“The only pure freshman building is the McCarthy Honors College, which [houses] 550 freshmen. The remaining buildings are all for upperclassmen,” Marsh said.
Besides its proximity to campus, The Village has many other benefits.
“Accessibility to the University is going to be very easy-flowing for the students living here,” Marsh said. “Having the retail function is a real bonus. To be able to have a room and walk downstairs into Trader Joe’s will be a great benefit for anyone living here. It should make their educational and living experience easier.”
Despite El Niño’s rain, the builders made schedule adjustments to stay on schedule.
“To remain on track, we have been tracking El Niño,” Marsh said. “This has been one of our biggest priorities, and we’ve been tracking it so much that when we have windows of opportunity to accelerate our schedule, we have. So, in essence, the El Niño at this point has actually helped accelerate our project.”
Vice President and Executive Director for Capital Construction Lloyd Silverstein commented on how surprisingly fast the Village has gone up, taking only 15 months so far.
“People on the other side of the construction fence have commented that [The Village] just suddenly appeared one day,” Silverstein said. “All of the construction you see here today, including the two-story underground parking structure and miles of foundation and utilities you can’t see, were all put in place in less than 15 months. That’s an amazing accomplishment by what is clearly the best team of construction workers in the city of L.A.”
Curren Price Jr., Los Angeles’s city councilman for District 9, applauded the construction workers and praised the improvements that USC Village will bring to the students and surrounding community. Congresswoman Karen Bass also elaborated on the improvements The Village has made.
“USC has been consistent in its commitment to make sure that the people who live in the area actually were able to work on this project,” Bass said. “Everybody knows the unemployment in the area, and so I think that contribution is particularly significant.”
The last structural steel beam — signed by many guests, administrators, donors, elected officials and construction workers — was lifted by a crane into the air with an American flag and evergreen tree on top. Then, the 30-foot, 12,700 pound spire was lifted to the top of the clock tower on the soon-to-be McCarthy Honors College, completing the highest point of The Village at 145 feet. As the spire was lowered onto the clock tower, the massive crowd of spectators cheered and clapped as the Trojan Marching Band played “Fight On” and confetti cannons blasted.
The Village will open in Fall 2017.

USC is about to get an entirely new nighttime scene, and it’s taking place right here on campus.
The University’s Campus Activities is in the process of developing Late Night ’SC, a new program that will provide undergraduate and graduate students with a wide variety of after hours activities to do on campus. From movie nights in Bovard Auditorium to midnight farmers markets the programs will take place Thursdays through Saturdays from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.
The program is run by Gabriel Valenzuela, director of USC Campus Activities. Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Jordan Fowler is assisting Valenzuela as Late Night ’SC’s student program manager.
“I brought [Fowler] on board because I thought it’d be great to have the vision from the student’s perspective as well,” Valenzuela said. “What I want to see is a little different from what students wants to see.”
While Valenzuela oversees the program, Fowler and students who choose to be involved in the Late Night ’SC team will handle more day-to-day requirements such as keeping the social media platforms updated with current events.
“I think in college, obviously academics are so important, but so much of your college experience is defined by your social interactions and what you choose to do in that free time, and I think that Late Night ’SC is an opportunity to make those late night programs in your social experience more accessible to you,” Fowler said. “Right now, there is so much freedom, so we want students to let us know what they want and we can make it happen.”
Though USC already has some late night programs through organizations such as Residential Education or USG Program Board, the goal of Late Night ’SC is to take all of those different activities and put them together in one package to create a more cohesive space among the University.
“I think Late Night ’SC will foster a much greater sense of community,” Fowler said. “Those people you meet at random events, those interactions that you don’t necessarily expect or set out to have, can be really long lasting. I hope that Late Night ‘SC will provide a new platform to meet new people and let students expand their interests as well.”
What Late Night ’SC is aiming for is as much involvement from students and their organizations as possible. They are hoping a wide variety of student clubs on campus will want to participate and plan events that Late Night ‘SC can then help promote and manage.
“We’re excited about it; however I think we still need more vision, which is really a call for students, no matter how crazy their idea is,” Valenzuela said.
Fowler hopes that online and social media platforms such as Facebook will serve as the main method of spreading the word about Late Night ’SC programs. Eventually, when the program is further developed, she hopes to create a home base on campus where students can go and find out about different events of the evening. Valenzuela hopes that Student Affairs can support other clubs in creating events for Late Night ’SC.
“Basically we are the marketing and supporting arm,” Valenzuela said. “So if someone hosts an event, we want to offer them the chance to make it a Late Night ’SC event and provide them with the appropriate giveaways like t-shirts, stickers, balloons and so on.”
Looking forward, Fowler and Valenzuela hope this new initiative will increase student safety and add variety to the types of activities students can partake in on campus at night.
“I think giving students safe options and more options is always helpful,” Valenzuela said. “With anything it’s a balance. The overall aim is to provide this alternative type of program with fun activities that are all happening at night and put them under one branch.”
The program is expected to kick off end of February or early March, to coincide with the longer days and better weather.
“My goal is in a year’s time, Late Night ’SC will have really taken off and everyone will know what it is,” Valenzuela said. “This is kind of like a two-to-three year vision, rather than semester. Hopefully, it is here to stay.”’

Spurred by the removal of the diversity requirement from the General Education curriculum beginning Fall 2015, the USC Department of American Studies and Ethnicity held a forum Wednesday evening to discuss diversity on campus. Panelists included Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs Gene Bickers, Vice Dean for Academic Programs Steven Lamy, ASE Associate Professor Shana Redmond, Interim ASE Chair Viet Thanh Nguyen, ASE graduate student Emily Raymundo and Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath.
“In short, this topic is critical to any definition of ethnic studies or American studies,” Nguyen said in an email to students. “It’s crucial to our intellectual work as scholars. It’s crucial to our pedagogical work as teachers and students. We have a great deal invested in how this University (mis)understands diversity and how it plans to deal with it.”
Bickers began the discussion by introducing the history of the GE requirements, saying that the former diversity requirement came about in GE requirements from the 1990s. According to Bickers, the language of the requirement recognized that students will need to “grapple” with increasing diversity in their lives.
The University’s accreditation is reviewed every decade, with the most recent review occurring in 2011, shortly after the appointment of President C. L. Max Nikias. In response to recommendations by the accreditation board, USC began an effort to revise its GE program. After a multi-year effort, new requirements were unveiled that took effect for students entering the university in the fall semester 2015 and were, according to Bickers, very similar to the GE programs at Stanford and Yale.
According to Lamy, the diversity requirement was not removed from the new GE program, but instead was revised and expanded with a new requirement for courses in “Citizenship in a Global Era.”
“It’s a balancing act, and the attempt was to put the emphasis on issues that every person should grapple with,” Bickers said. “What’s missing — because it’s called global perspectives — is the label, ‘diversity,’” Lamy said.
Lamy, who is also an international relations professor, pointed out that one of his classes, which explores issues that affect the world, would not have been included in the old diversity requirement but is included in the new global perspectives requirement.
After Bickers and Lamy explained the background of the GE program, the conversation focused more closely on diversity as an educational tenet.
“The importance of a diversity requirement is not solely about representation,” Redmond said. Redmond also said that diversity requirements are as important as foreign language requirements and that “all educational institutions should not only include these courses as requirements, but build their entire curriculum around them.”
Raymundo bemoaned the disappearance of the word “diversity” from the GE program, saying that “without that important word diversity, [we’re] led to broad categories” that don’t emphasize the subject. All Dornsife classes, she said, should address diversity in some sort of rigorous way.
Sampath said she has only had two female professors even though she is only six units away from graduating. In response to an audience member who mentioned learning about one’s heritage, Sampath argued that it’s important to learn from diverse educators.
She added that as an international relations major, she was saddened to see that the faculty of the IR department all “look the same.”
Audience member Nikita Johri, a junior majoring in cognitive science and international relations, observed that for many of her friends, GE requirements are just a “checkmark” to be filled on the way to a degree. She felt that diversity and other GE requirements should be deeply embedded in any student’s education.
“I think it’s important to think of the impact that these classes are having on our students,” Johri said.
Toward the end of the forum, Nguyen asked the audience for ideas of action that could be offered to Provost Michael Quick. Suggestions included, but are not limited to: a campaign to hire more diverse faculty, including diversity in STEM courses, requiring faculty to be informed on diversity and reinstating the diversity requirement.
ASE Associate Professor Francille Wilson, while critical of the lack of a diversity requirement, praised the fact that such a forum took place.
“I want to applaud the undergraduate and graduate students for holding the faculty and administration’s feet to the fire,” Wilson said.
Good riddance to a well-intended, benevolent, but defective idea. For every “diverse” person admitted to USC, another non-diverse person is excluded. If both are absolutely equal, then maybe this is of neutral impact, at best. I cannot speak for USC, but I taught at a famous national university where the diverse admittees were placed in a terrible situation. Too many were admitted unqualified, over their heads academically, and flunked out with great disappointment and bitterness all around. Discriminate for one religion, race or color, and the institution necessarily discriminates equally against others. Merit and promise should be the criteria, not diversity.

Tucked behind the familiar food courts and fountains of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center lies the Rapp Engineering Building, home to USC’s Rocket Propulsion Laboratory. Enter through an unsuspecting door nestled in the back alley, and you’ll be greeted by the smell of machine grease, the whisper of a nearby wind tunnel and a fleet of retired rockets adorning the walls and ceiling. Here, undergraduate student engineers are working tirelessly to realize their mission to send a rocket into space.
The magic number is 328,084 feet, more than 200 times the height that the Goodyear Blimp flies over the Coliseum during game days. Recently, the engineers at RPL have been getting even closer to their goals with some exciting projects. Last November, engineers of the RPL launched a rocket in the Mojave Desert that reached 25,000 feet and traveled at a speed of Mach 1.1, faster than the speed of sound. The Déjà Vu rocket was considered a great success by the engineers of the RPL not only for its height and speed but also for its aerodynamics.
According to Allie Gehris, a junior majoring in astronautical engineering and chief propulsion engineer and communications officer of RPL, the Déjà Vu’s success was the result of learning from RPL’s past mistakes.
“We have had a lot of trouble aerodynamically in past rockets, and we’ve worked it out with some number crunching and problem solving,” Gehris said.
Compared to previous rockets, Déjà Vu flew in a much straighter path and its functions operated mostly as predicted. Those who missed out on the spectacle of the November launch will have the opportunity to see the Déja Vu in action again, as the engineers of the RPL designed the rocket to be reusable, hence the name.
But RPL’s newest rocket is expected to shine even brighter than Déjà Vu. The engineers at RPL project that the rocket could reach speeds of Mach 4 — four times the speed of sound — and heights of 180,000 feet. In addition, they predict that the newest rocket will have improved aerodynamics, since that has received so much attention in the design process. The still unnamed rocket is currently nearing the end of the design and planning phase, as minor parts are being fabricated. Once completed, the rocket will launch from the Black Rock Desert. Gehris encourages all who are interested to join the electric environment.
“On launch days, there’s a ton of energy in the atmosphere, there are a lot of last minute to dos and everybody is making sure that they’re system is going to be perfect,” Gehris said. Everybody is jittery with nervous energy. All of your work, hopes, and dreams are sitting on a launch rail.”
Involvement in the RPL is open to any student of any major with no GPA requirement. Although members are mostly Viterbi majors, the team has members from Dornsife and Marshall informing the process as well.
According to Michael Thorson, a sophomore studying astronautical engineering, RPL can serve as a great learning experience even for those who have never built a rocket before.
“There is a general acceptance of any skill level,” Thorson said. “Come to rocket lab with no experience and be taught to build a rocket from scratch.”
Thorson joined the rocket lab last year, and since then has learned a variety of skills in rocket engineering. His role in the next rocket includes laying composites for the structure of the rocket, specifically the nose cone and the motor case. Members are encouraged to contribute what they’re passionate about, according to Thorson.
“If you want to build a circuit-board, you can do that too,” Thorson said.
In addition to high level math skills, complex engineering, and brilliant problem solving, these students bring an element of Trojan pride to their work. Rockets designed to potentially reach space are named after the school’s mascot, Traveller. So far the team has built many iterations of the Traveler series of rockets, eagerly awaiting the day that one of them will leave the planet’s atmosphere.
The organization’s drive toward its goal is strong, and Gehris notes that rocket clubs are being created at more and more universities across the country.
“There’s a lot of competition with other schools,” Gehris said. “UC San Diego has the goal to sent a rocket into space. Among other schools there’s Embry-Riddle, Boston University, and [University of Maine], they’ve all recently had some rocket clubs pop up. Stanford wants to be the first to send a university built rocket to space. They also want to build two satellites, and a high altitude balloon.”
