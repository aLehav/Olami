This Saturday, the second Women’s March will draw crowds of women and feminist allies to the streets of downtown Los Angeles on the anniversary of President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Last year’s Women’s March drew record-breaking numbers of protesters the day after Trump’s inauguration. In Los Angeles in particular, an estimated 750,000 took to the streets at last year’s march, surpassing participation in any other city in the United States. Around the world, millions of protesters marched together in solidarity. The march’s emphasis on empowerment, positivity and celebration of all the progress feminists have made thus far has transformed it into much more than a mere reaction to Trump’s election. From this year on, the march will be an annual reminder of what women and all marginalized people can achieve through unity and activism. USC and universities across the country exemplify the potential of young people to impact meaningful change, not just in their lives, but in society as well. 
As Trojans, Bruins and other college students take to the streets of Los Angeles Saturday, it is important to recognize the role of national universities as microcosms of society at large. 
Just last Tuesday, the Undergraduate Student Government Senate introduced a resolution to offer free feminine hygiene products in campus restrooms. This would fulfill a crucial health need for female students who come from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, and who aren’t immune to being caught by surprise in campus restrooms. 
Universities across the country, such as Brown University, Grinnell College and many more, have all launched similar programs. Here at USC, the resolution was made possible by campus dialogue and conversation between University officials, USG representatives and the student body. Two years ago, the Daily Trojan Editorial Board called for the University to offer this service. When young people unite, raise their voices and fight for change, there’s no limit to the reforms they can enact. 
Even women’s health policies that once seemed like pipedreams are making astounding progress on campus. Last Friday, a week ahead of the Women’s March, a bill that would require California public universities to offer medication abortion services in their campus health centers passed the state Senate Education committee. 
On Thursday, it passed the Senate Appropriations committee. SB 320 could substantially improve the health and living standards of female college students throughout the state, especially those in rural areas far from women’s health centers, or from low-income backgrounds. The new law promotes gender equality in education by ensuring female students won’t have to face an added, gendered burden in missing classes, work or internships to travel off campus for basic health care. 
Leaders of the public university’s Students United for Reproductive Justice group worked directly with local policymakers and state lawmakers to bring SB 320 up for consideration in 2016, while UC Berkeley’s student government senate passed a resolution demanding abortion access on campus in the same year. If SB 320 is signed into law, it will not place any obligation on private institutions like USC, but it will create an atmosphere in which USC and other private schools are encouraged to embrace social progress.
At USC, Vice President for  Student Affairs Ainsley Carry released a plan to reform education around campus sexual assault, which would emphasize bystander intervention to prevent sexual assault. Last semester, the University’s Title IX office drastically revamped its website to be more user-friendly and provide greater detail about Title IX and the reporting process to students. 
While USC has a long way to go to fully protect survivors’ rights and address the epidemic of campus assault — the University is still the subject of a national Title IX investigation — in the past year alone, it has made crucial progress, in no small part due to a renaissance of activism on the issue spanning back to 2013. 
Carry himself spoke to the Daily Trojan just last year about how he had been inspired by “the days when students were banging down my door saying, ‘Let’s do something to end sexual misconduct on our campus.’” That activism has led to tangible actions by the University to combat violence against women and work toward the goal of gender parity on campus.
The Women’s March is a celebration of victories like these. In the Trump era, the nation is faced with a collective reckoning over its identity, values and its undecided future. But with young women and allies increasingly positioning themselves at the forefront of this national reckoning, there’s cause for hope and optimism — and that’s what the Women’s March is all about.
Daily Trojan Spring 2018 Editorial Board
Let’s be perfectly honest. This wasn’t a women’s march. It was a leftist women’s march. Big difference.
Hooray! Feminist parasites in pink pussy hats are going to save American democracy! Just make sure they clean up after their pathetic mass-protests are done.

As I write this, it still remains unclear when, and if, the House of Representatives will vote on the short-term funding bill known as a continuing resolution that would avoid government shutdown.
The idea of a continuing resolution itself is commonplace and remarkably unsexy — so why all the noise? The caveat drumming up this week’s political theatre was the GOP’s decision to reduce the lives of millions of naturalized children to a political bargaining chip. As it stands, the C.R. wouldn’t provide for any sort of much-needed DACA substitute or immigration policy in its plans — another one of President Donald Trump’s forgotten promises — nor any word on the disaster relief that continues to remain immediately necessary for the many Americans rebuilding in Puerto Rico. Bigger fish to fry? The dire necessity of avoiding a government shutdown? (If we’ve learned anything from President Barack Obama’s second term, Republicans hate those.) Please. 
Don’t be fooled. The funding package purposefully doesn’t include these things, and it never would have. I hope no one really ever thought the president who casually characterized Mexicans as “rapists” and described developing nations as “sh-tholes” would actually be keen on considering any sort of responsible, comprehensive immigration plan. Even Rep. Paul Ryan’s widely despised C.R. “alternative” ignored DACA like it didn’t exist — all so that the Trump administration and congressional Republicans could continue to kick the can down the road until it’s too late to do anything about it. They’re stonewalling and stalling in hopes that their recent failures to put forward any sort of comprehensive health care reform, immigration reform or disaster relief will be ignored in the upcoming midterms. And they want to use the threat of a potential shutdown as a red herring to stave off the Democratic lead in the polls, which reached double-digits this week. Nonpartisan institutions have time and time again demonstrated that most Americans want a DACA renewal or updated alternative or comprehensive replacement — in other words, something. A decision. The Republican message is clear: As long as inaction remains advantageous for the 300 or so individuals in the Congressional GOP, millions of other Americans will never have an answer.
Shutdowns are never ideal; they’re unpopular and useless to the goals of either party. But if the GOP is going to force Democrats and reasonable members of their own party to choose between shutdown and chicanery, the result seems already clear: Shutdown it is. If Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell really want to avoid the shutdown that will, as they have so persuaded, crumble our military and make our children cry, they should put forward a passable bill. Otherwise, it’s on them. 
The most important thing to remember as we watch this play out in D.C. is the necessity of involvement and attention. If anything, do not let this become another episode of the dramatic post-2016 politics to which we have become so desensitized; DREAMers walk among us every day — at this University, in our clubs and classes, our workplaces, our lives. Put pressure on your representatives. Don’t allow human lives to be trivialized by a president and an administration so clearly unmoved by the will of the people, and undeterred by the lack of a public mandate. 
Centrist Republicans and Democrats have continued to put forward bipartisan alternatives. These include Sen. Lindsey Graham and Sen. Dick Durbin’s immigration reform proposal from the Gang of Six (a bipartisan group attempting to offer alternatives, and comprised of three Republican members) which McConnell has refused to even glance at. To add fuel to the fire, Trump recently tweeted that the Children’s Health Insurance Program provision included in the measure — a six-year reauthorization of the CHIP — should be removed. Endangering and compromising the lives of 6 million American kids? All in a day’s tweets. Meanwhile, Ryan has attempted to urge Congress members away from shutdown by pivoting to the military, and how shutdown would utterly destroy it (were the usual suspects, Ronald Reagan and Our Christian Values, unavailable?) One GOP House member, Rep. Mark Walker, recently called the C.R. a “crap sandwich.” How remarkably reassuring.
The nature of our democracy, in each small part, is defined by our response to situations like these. How do we act in the face of an administration more concerned with the assent of its supporters rather than the consent of the governed? One that responds with avoidance and evasion instead of plans and legislation? Fittingly, a symbolic vote on Friday will be followed by a Women’s March on Saturday. If we want to demand reform and demand progress, we have to, well, actually demand it. With calls. With outcry.

Lily, not attacking you, but I am confused. It appeared that you used the phrase “millions of naturalized children,” to describe the DACA group members who are seeking to remain in the US, and to achieve protection under law. DACA members are not naturalized, if I understand the term. Yes, Congress should establish a law that would naturalize them, but that means US citizenship or legal permanent resident “green card” status. Please explain.
The Democrats are holding up immigration reform not the Republicans. It is the Democrats who are n using DACA as a bargain chip in a process where it shouldn’t even be there. You speak from the DNC talking points booklet of propaganda and are not making any clear statements on your own. Pull yourself out of the emotion of things are use logical reasoning and you’ll discover something wonderful.   Democrats are tiara and manioulators. That’s it. No platform, no integrity to be authentic in the governing process, obstructionist in execution. As they keepmthisnup, 2018 will be another landslide election year for the GOP.

You’ve had sushi. You’ve tried ramen. Next, get a taste of the classic Japanese dish donburi. Takasan Japanese Bowls, a new restaurant located in Downtown Los Angeles, opened on Jan. 7 and specializes in donburi, or traditional Japanese rice bowls often layered with chicken or beef. A variety of meat, toppings and seasonal ingredients give each bowl a unique flavor. 
Founded by Tucker Iida, a graduate of Cornell University, Takasan prides itself on omotenashi, the traditional practice of “hospitality” that caters to each customer. Indeed, the fast-casual eatery provides a comfortable, welcoming Japanese dining experience amid the bustle of the city. 
From fried chicken and spicy tuna to ribeye steak, Takasan has something for everyone. Upon entering, customers are immediately greeted with a simple but well-stocked menu, and the prompt attention of the service staff. Ordering at the counter is easy: pick an entree and pick a base. The main menu offers eight signature rice bowls, which can be customized with white rice, brown rice or salad. From there, customers can choose to eat inside or at the small outdoor patio. 
Sauce Katsu-Don and Yakiniku-Don have quickly become top sellers. Sauce Katsu-Don combines salty and sweet with crispy fried chicken, Japanese mayonnaise and classic katsu sauce. For those craving a twist on traditional flavors, the Yakiniku-Don has sliced ribeye steak, onion, egg and sweet-spicy sauce. Nasu-Don, a vegetarian option, comes with roasted eggplant, sweet soy glaze, seaweed salad, shiitake mushrooms and cabbage. 
Takasan specialises in donburi, traditional Japanese bowls. Photo from Yelp.
Classic Japanese menu items such as Katsu Curry-Don and Chicken Teriyaki-Don are also available at affordable prices. Optional side dishes of Karaage fried chicken, edamame and spicy tuna on crispy rice complete the meal, leaving customers with happy, full stomachs. As for beverages, Boxed Water and Japanese soft drinks Ramune and Calpis are just a few of the diverse options. 
The clean-cut interior reflects both the efficient service and the simplicity of the Japanese rice bowls. A Japanese tapestry provides a picturesque backdrop, while modern hanging lights give the space a more modern ambience. Succulents, which seem to be prevalent at every contemporary eatery in Los Angeles, are tucked in a small shelf along the wall. Altogether, the minimalistic decor of Takasan allows customers to better appreciate the modest but savory donburi and friendly company at a wooden Zen industrial community table.
Takasan has figured out how to make the old seem new, and less than a month after opening, the restaurant already has a steady stream of customers coming in to try its most popular dish. And although the current menu is rather small, there are enough options to entice customers to return and try something new. According to the menu, Takasan is expanding to include a variety of drinks, desserts and even more donburi. 
If Takasan continues its outstanding customer service and expands its menu, the place will surely be packed before long. With the help of Takasan, donburi is certainly poised to take over as the next millennial food craze.
The low prices make Takasan an attractive fast-food place for college students. Iida remarked that many USC students have already stopped by for a meal at the restaurant, which is located only a few miles from campus. With prices that never exceed $12, Takasan has the potential to be a hotspot for Trojans seeking a quick, cheap and satisfying meal.

In my first weeks at USC, I thought I was adjusting well to college life. I loved the freedom from my parents. I felt like I came into my freshman year already involved in the community because I had joined the Daily Trojan earlier that summer, and I was signed up to volunteer as a local preschool teacher through USC’s Jumpstart program. My roommates and I were instant friends, and though my classes were challenging, they weren’t as difficult as I had expected them to be.
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
But slowly, that positive start to my semester began to fade until, about a month into the semester, my daily life had changed in some major ways. I began to overeat regularly, I started having trouble staying asleep at night and I was losing my academic focus; I was no longer putting as much work into my assignments and getting grades that reflected it.
I stopped conversing with anyone but my roommates or the minimal conversation that was required of my classes and extracurriculars at USC and began to lose touch with many of my high school friends — an experience that was inherently accompanied by overwhelming loneliness. At one point, I even began to question whether my chosen career track — journalism — was right for me, even though I’d known since fifth grade that I want to be a journalist.
I didn’t realize it at the time, but it was podcasts that were helping me deal with what I was going through.
I was already an avid listener to podcasts — their versatile quality made them perfect to listen to on long trips or while doing chores — but they grew to become an even more important part of my life last semester.
“Beautiful/Anonymous,” a podcast where host Chris Gethard talks to a single, random person for an hour without them ever sharing their name, brought me stories of others who were going through, or had gone through, their own mental health issues, making me feel less alone while helping me realize that I would eventually get past my current challenges.
“Tell Me Something I Don’t Know,” a game show podcast where contestants share interesting research and studies under the main criteria of judges, helped me rediscover my love for learning, prompting me to begin putting in the effort I needed to for my classes and their assignments.
“Sleep With Me,” a podcast literally designed to help fight insomnia, provided a soothing, disorienting sound that would make me fall asleep in 15 minutes, and enjoy a great night of sleep.
Podcasts also proved to be helpful beyond their individual sound.
By some weird coincidence, the director of research of “Radiolab” (one of my favorite podcasts because it uses sound to tell stories in an unmatched imaginative way), Latif Nasser, happened to be giving a talk at my residential college. Hearing him speak about storytelling and journalism, and talking to him individually after the event, reinforced my commitment to journalism and made me even more excited to be pursuing that career.
Writing has always been therapeutic for me, and throughout the semester, I was working on a podcast review guide, a 10,000-word blog on my 100 favorite podcasts. Finishing the guide last semester was one of the few things I felt like I had accomplished, and it provided a sense of progress in time that otherwise felt dreadfully stagnant.
There are thousands of podcasts out there, and the ones I’ve listened to have had profound effects on my life. But podcasts are still a relatively obscure medium compared to storytelling through film or literature. So I’m going to use this column to share my relationships with the podcasts I’ve listened to, with the hope that someone out there might benefit from the affectual sound experiences that podcasts are.
Karan Nevatia is a freshman majoring in journalism. He is also the news editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Pod Willing,” runs every other Friday.
 
Wow, I can say how humbled I am to know the podcast helps you get some rest. I hope it can continue to be a source of support while you pursue your studies and when you move on to your career in journalism or whatever avenue you decide to bring your viewpoint and talents too. Thank you. -Drew

Senior guard Jordan McLaughlin was as cool as ice down the stretch in Eugene, Ore., where the Trojans battled the Ducks to the final buzzer Thursday night. 
Photo by Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
Up by a point with 38 seconds to play, McLaughlin was at the line trying to extend USC’s lead — and he did. The senior captain made both free throws. Then, after Oregon’s Paul White rebutted with a made layup, McLaughlin was fouled again. And, again, he made both free throws to set the score at 73-70. 
In desperation, on the next possession, Oregon’s Payton Pritchard shot and missed a 3-pointer well beyond the top of the key. Who else could have come away with the rebound but McLaughlin? Pritchard was forced to foul McLaughlin to stop the clock, but it was too late for the Ducks. McLaughlin, in his third trip to the line in a span of 20 seconds, iced the game with his fifth and sixth free throws in the final minute. The final score: USC over Oregon, 75-70. 
It was a desperately needed road win for USC (14-6, 5-2). Any Pac-12 road win is like a cherry on top over the course of a demanding conference schedule. This one keeps USC only one game behind conference co-leaders Arizona and Stanford. Moreover, such a conference road win certainly bolsters USC’s NCAA Tournament resume. Prior to tip-off, ESPN college basketball analyst Joe Lunardi ranked the Trojans as one of the first four teams out of the tournament.
Oregon (12-7, 2-4), on the other hand, will likely miss the tournament only a year after reaching the Final Four for the first time since 1939. The 2017-18 season is a rebuilding year for Oregon’s program. The Ducks lost their top five scorers from a year ago, including Pac-12 Player of the Year Dillon Brooks and current Golden State Warrior Jordan Bell.
After bleeding talent to the NBA, Oregon was sitting Ducks for USC’s first win in Eugene since 2009—before the Matthew Knight Arena had been built. Tonight’s win for USC also snapped a 14-game overall losing streak to the Ducks. 
For once, USC had the talent advantage over Oregon on the court, but the Ducks were not intimidated. Backed by a raucous home crowd, the Ducks overcame a 10-point first half deficit and traded the lead with the Trojans down to the final minute of the game.
However, USC’s best shined brightest. Junior forwards Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright scored 18 apiece. Meanwhile, senior guards Elijah Stewart and McLaughlin led the team in rebounding. McLaughlin nearly finished with a triple double: 11 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Once again, sophomore guard Jonah Mathews proved valuable off the bench with 11 points. Since ceding his starting job to junior Shaqquan Aaron three games ago, Mathews has been one of USC’s leading scorers. 
While USC blew a double-digit lead, they closed out a Pac-12 road win, which is never easy to do. The Trojans have now won five of their past six games and seem to be making a formidable march toward the top of the Pac-12 standings. Over the next three weeks, USC will play UCLA, Stanford and Arizona, the league’s three top teams in the standings, plus Arizona State, which has started conference play poorly but has been ranked as high as third nationally earlier in the season. 
Road wins against middling teams like Oregon are essential for the Trojans to build some cushion into their conference record before a looming stretch of games — probably the season’s most difficult slate. 
Depending on their upcoming play, the Trojans could move out of Lunardi’s bracket bubble. With a sweep of wins, they could virtually secure a spot in the Big Dance. With an array of losses, their outlook could be much less promising. 
Next up, the Trojans will travel to Corvallis for a Saturday night matchup against the Oregon State Beavers (11-7, 3-3). The game tips off at 5 p.m. and will be broadcast on Pac-12 Networks. 
The team will aim to extend its conference winning streak to four games before returning to the Galen Center to face Stanford (11-8, 5-1) in a rematch on Wednesday.

Women’s tennis has kicked off the season with a splash, clinching the home opener against University of San Diego, 6-1. Despite the departure of long-time head coach Richard Gallien, his replacement  Alison Swain started a new era on the right track. Swain, who led her previous team at Williams College to eight NCAA Division III championships and a 224-28 record, has large shoes to fill. Although the Women of Troy never made it to the finals under Gallien, he still held an impressive 367-144 record at USC.
According to the USC Trojans website, Swain plans to take her new position step-by-step as she works with her new team. “I think our immediate goal is about process,” she said. “It’s about creating a structure for our players to be successful and develop on-court as players, and then it’s about creating a great team culture.”
Women’s tennis ended the 2016-17 season 13-11, but fell to University of Denver in the first round of the NCAA tournament. The tennis team looks to make an even stronger showing this season with returning nationally-ranked ITA singles and doubles players.
Among them is senior captain Gabby Smith, who enters the season ranked No. 35 in the country. In 2017, she had a record of 23-9 in singles play, whose matches helped secure an upset against UCLA and a win against LMU. Senior Madison Westby ended last season with a 24-13 singles record and claimed the No. 85 slot. Junior Rianna Valdes and sophomore Angela Kulikov also carved spots on the national rankings for doubles at No. 46. Valdes and Kulikov had a 3-0 record in the fall.
This season, the women’s tennis team welcomes three new Trojans. Freshman Alexa Corcoleotes comes to USC as the No. 39 player in her class, with a Gold Ball in doubles at the 2016 Women’s Grass Court Nationals and a Silver Ball in the 2016 Women’s Hard Court Nationals.
The team also brings on two transfer students. Sophomore Constance Branstine joins the women’s tennis team after completing a year at UC Irvine, and sophomore Rebecca Weissmann arrives after a year at Louisiana State.
Branstine played No. 1 singles and doubles at UCI, and was selected to play singles in the 2017 All-Big West First Team. Weissmann played No. 5 singles and No. 2 doubles, and was ranked as high as 12th in the nation in high school.
Hopes are high for the upcoming season as the Women of Troy have already had a promising start, even before their first game. They opened up the season with two trophies from the Battle of the Bay under their belt.
Weissmann proved her worth by winning the Women’s Open Singles and another trophy with Kulikov, her doubles partner from the Women’s Doubles Open Championship.
The USC women’s tennis team dominated USD on Sunday, winning all three doubles matches and only dropping one in singles. Swain told USC Athletics that she was pleased with her team’s performance.
“I thought today was a great opening match for our program,” Swain said. “I was really proud of how much we fought and stayed focus throughout the whole match, regardless of the score. Most importantly we competed as a team today, which was our goal.”
This weekend, the women’s tennis team finishes up their three-game home-stand as they take on LMU on Jan. 19 at 1:30 p.m., and UCSB on Jan. 20 at 10 a.m. Neither school is ranked in the top 25, but LMU boasts two nationally-ranked freshmen on their roster.

Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
It’s probably safe to say most fans love sports for their drama above all else — the fleeting minutes after a miraculous comeback or championship-winning score that transcend some of life’s most memorable moments. But sometimes, our affinity for those instants makes us conjure up narratives that aren’t there.
I felt myself doing this on Wednesday, when news broke that North and South Korea had struck a deal for a gesture of unity at the Winter Olympics in February. There was doubt last year whether the hermit nation would even attend the Games (North Korea boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, the South’s capital, and doesn’t have a strong attendance record at the winter edition). Now, the North and South will march together under a single flag during the opening ceremony and field a joint women’s hockey team.
It’ll be a strange experience for many here in the United States to watch a pair of countries technically still at war standing under one flag, but back where I was born, it represents what people want to see. Most South Koreans dream of reunification (there’s an entire government agency devoted to it): It’s just a matter of whether they trust their northern neighbors enough to even entertain the prospect of cooperation. There’s an inherent feeling on the peninsula that the two countries are one nation, but it’s hard to forget times like 1987, when the North bombed a southern passenger jet leading up to Seoul’s opening ceremony.
Still, when an announcement like Wednesday’s comes around, the sentimental sports fan in me can’t help but think of the perfect, stranger-than-fiction setup for another classic story. What if the unified Korean team makes a Cinderella run to a medal? It would be a completely different — and perhaps even more incredible — Miracle on Ice. What if the decades of animosity and conflict finally started coming to an end in Pyeongchang?
But I’ve already lived through this moment. Sixteen years ago, my family settled into the seats of the Seoul World Cup Stadium to watch an exhibition between the North and South. It was the two teams’ first meeting on the pitch in more than a decade. Soccer’s popularity had exploded in East Asia thanks to South Korea and Japan’s joint hosting of the 2002 World Cup, where the former upset the likes of Spain and Italy in a magical run to the third-place match. 
Sixty-thousand fans were in a frenzy, chanting “unification” and “peace in Korea.” The game was a boring, scoreless draw, but after the final whistle, the competitors embraced. Cameras focused in on a South Korean player stripping off his uniform to reveal underneath: “SOUTH KOREA LOVES NORTH KOREA.” The North would send more than 300 athletes south to the port city of Busan later that month for the 2002 Asian Games. North Korean leader Kim-Jong un was still in college; President Donald Trump was merely a loud-mouthed real estate mogul. The end of the conflict seemed just around the corner.
South and North Korea have faced each other more than 20 times on the soccer field since that night. The North has also continued its aggressive nuclear program, and the two nations even fired artillery at each other in 2010. I have always cherished the healing capacity of sports — the Red Sox helping Boston recover from the Boston Marathon bombings with a World Series title in 2013, the Astros doing the same for Houston after Hurricane Harvey last year — but this old wound is too deep to be ameliorated by any ballgame.
So, despite a glimmer of hope, South Koreans will soon return to a reality of uncertainty on the peninsula. For three weeks, however, there will be a team the entire nation can get behind. It’s even more significant in an Olympics that has failed to drum up much local or global interest, and if it can make it out of group play, the joint women’s hockey squad could command the spotlight in Pyeongchang, which will be without NHL stars or a true American-Russian rivalry.
Speaking of Americans, it’s tough to predict how this Korean embrace will be received stateside. It would be easy to root against the athletes, considering North Korea’s threat to the United States. But the competitors under the unified flag don’t reflect their governments. Despite generations of conflict, a group of women will take the ice next month as a Korea on the world stage after war destroyed a country and countless families nearly 70 years ago. The team may not win a medal, but maybe its simple existence is enough of a miracle to bring some unity — however temporary — to today’s fractured world.

Topping scholar and senior David Delgado spoke against the provost’s decision to eliminate Christina Yokoyama’s position as the Topping Fund director at a rally Thursday at Tommy Trojan. Kyle Kawaguchi | Daily Trojan
Norman Topping Student Aid Fund scholars and faculty allies rallied Thursday at Tommy Trojan, sporting black shirts that read “We Are Not Your Tokens #SaveTopping,” in protest against the University’s decision to remove the Topping director position currently held by Christina Yokoyama.
This comes after two weeks of organized efforts — including an online petition, a social media campaign and dozens of letters to administration — taken by the Topping Fund in an attempt to persuade the provost’s office to reverse the decision.
“I want to say to Vice Provost  [of Undergraduate Programs Andrea] Hodge: ‘If you feel that Christina is only a salary that can be expended, then you cannot be any further away from the truth,’” said Ryan Lopez, a Topping scholar and senior majoring in chemistry. “Just how Christina was there for us when we needed her, now we’re here for Christina when she needs us.”
The rally was organized by Topping scholars, as well as several alumni and faculty. 
“We felt it was very important to have this #SaveTopping rally … to make enough noise [so the administration says], ‘We have to create a conversation with them,’” said David Delgado, a Topping scholar and senior majoring in gender studies and theatre. “At least today by the looks of it … it seems to be exactly the right move we needed to make.”
The rally was held a day after the same scholars sent out a memorandum, calling for a vote of no confidence and Hodge’s resignation. 
In the memo, the Topping scholars expressed concerns about Hodge’s “ability to perform the duties of her position in a manner that benefits the USC student body.” 
The scholars stated that Hodge had violated the Topping Fund’s regulations, namely by ignoring motions passed by the Governing Board last Thursday, which would have invalidated the provost’s decision to remove the Topping program director position. 
“Dr. Hodge has demonstrated her inability to be an effective leader for the undergraduate student population by misleading them, lying to them and interfering with their ability to serve in the responsibilities that have been assigned to them,” the release stated. 
At the rally, students held posters and handed out flyers with information about the Topping Fund to passersby, while speaking about the importance of the Topping Fund and their dissatisfaction with the administration’s decision.
Delgado said the memo was drafted in response to Hodge and Quick’s unwillingness to reverse the decision to eliminate Yokoyama’s position despite resistance against it. 
“If we are to understand that [Hodge] doesn’t see anything negative about her actions toward the students … then obviously she is not meant to be representing a collection of students such as the Topping scholars,” Delgado said.
Hodge did not address the specific claims mentioned in the memo sent out by Topping scholars, but said in a statement to the Daily Trojan that she will continue to seek expanding the Topping program.
“I’ve been meeting with any and all students who want to meet with me, and I will continue to do so,” Hodge said in the statement.  “I welcome their ideas, their input and their candor about the benefits of the program.”
Quick also released a statement to the Daily Trojan on Thursday, in which he expressed his support for Hodge. He described her as a “strong advocate for students in all areas.”
“Professor Hodge has a full vote of confidence from me for all of the work she has done since she assumed the leadership of the Office of Undergraduate Programs,” Quick said in the statement. “I also fully embrace her vision and support for an expanded and improved Topping program.”

USC’s Visions and Voices hosted Daily Beast editor-in-chief and CNN political analyst John Avlon Thursday. The event took place at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom at 7 p.m. and was an opportunity for the audience to learn more about the history of the United States, journalism and politics.

After graduating from Yale University, Avlon quickly became involved in politics. From being a speechwriter for former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to preparing an address for the United Nations General Assembly in regard to counterterrorism, he became an acclaimed political journalist and author. Avlon has written several political books, including his latest, Washington’s Farewell: The Founding Father’s Warning to Future Generations published in January last year.
Before Avlon came on stage, President C. L. Max Nikias gave an introduction and brief biography of Avlon. 
“He’s one of America’s lead journalists, a passionate believer in American democracy and a stellar choice for our Visions and Voices event tonight,” Nikias said in his introduction. “As this evening’s distinguished speaker, he continues a tradition of celebrating thinkers, artists and leaders who have found their way to our stage and will bring the arts and humanities to our community.”
After the introduction, Avlon talked about the importance and historical context of George Washington’s farewell address, the subject of his latest book. Avlon said the address provides a parallel between the past and the present-day United States. Avlon classified the speech as one of the most influential in American history, and said Washington’s advice still endures.
“In our difficult days with storm clouds on the horizon, with great deep polarized debates about politics and policy and personality, imagine if we had the benefit of a memo, written to us by the first founding father,” Avlon said. 
Avlon continued by talking about his understanding of liberty and its importance for American society. He said that while liberty is seen as synonymous with freedom, it has a deeper meaning that America’s founders understood. 
“Liberty is what is required to really erect an independent republic,” Avlon said. “It is not simply doing whatever we want at any given time. It’s keeping in mind your responsibilities to your community, your family and the future generations. It’s about something you can inculcate as a culture. In this self-governing society, it is essential for survival.”
Avlon wrapped up his talk by comparing former President Barack Obama’s farewell address to Washington’s. 
“President Obama quoted [Washington’s speech] in his farewell address,” Avlon said. “And what struck me was the warning that Obama put forward was that we could not take our democracy for granted. He was articulating some of the same ideas that Washington was, not only in the section where he quoted it directly.”
Following his speech, Avlon answered questions from the audience about his book and his role as the editor-in-chief of the Daily Beast.

The Pac-12 Conference office announced Wednesday that USC was selected as the overall winner of the 2017 Football Zero Waste Competition.
For the competition, every Pac-12 university took part in diverting the most waste from the landfill at a predetermined football and men’s basketball game during the Fall 2017 season.
Sustainability advocates Bill Walton, Graham Oberly and Mike Carey selected the winners for the categories. Each school was evaluated on a summary scorecard detailing its efforts during the Zero Waste game.
Last October’s USC vs. Utah game was selected for evaluation. With a 90.96 percent gameday waste diversion rate, USC won first place.
Aside from choosing the overall winner, Pac-12 determined which institution utilized the most innovative methods to expand sustainability education efforts. Three other universities were also selected as winners for three subcategories, including fan engagement, most improved and student-athlete engagement.
During the Utah game, attendees were invited to engage in an interactive tailgate, giveaways, flash mobs, a live trumpet brigade and confetti cannons.
Recycle Man, a mascot who sported a green mask and an outfit bearing the recycling symbol, encouraged fans to partake in a bean bag toss. The toss had the attendees sort food waste and recyclables into the proper bins and educated attendees on sustainable habits.
According to Los Angeles Coliseum Program Director Brian Grant, the Zero Waste Initiative began in 2015. That same year, USC was recognized as the most improved university by the Pac-12. In 2016, USC also won the Zero Waste Bowl Challenge. This June, the University will be accepting the award at the Green Sports Alliance National Summit at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.
“We will go back to the Pac-12 sustainability conference and accept the award for the second straight year for our efforts in the 2017 football season,” Grant said. “We took a huge step forward.”

To develop new ways to improve cancer treatments in humans, researchers at the Keck School of Medicine recently studied the enzymes in marine animals that cause bioluminescence. 
Marine animals with bioluminescence, like the jellyfish pictured above, are helping a team of researchers at the Keck School of Medicine develop effective immunotherapy cancer treatments. Photo from Pixabay.
The team of researchers utilized these enzymes to develop a test to determine whether immunotherapies — uses of the immune system to fight cancer — are effective, according to a Scientific Reports study published on Jan. 9. The bioluminescent property of these enzymes allowed the researchers to see if a therapy is successful in killing cancer cells.
“[Immunotherapy] can use the body’s immune system to fight against several diseases including cancer in a similar way the body fights against foreign invaders,” said Hittu Matta, a Keck assistant professor of research medicine who contributed to the study.
According to Matta, a number of immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor-T cells (CAR-T) have been developed. Chimeric antigen receptors are proteins that help T cells recognize toxins on targeted cancer cells. 
However, since these are developed for a specific patient and not mass produced, creating them is expensive and having an accurate test to ensure their effectiveness is significant.
As a fairly new advancement in the cancer research field, immunotherapies can help scientists determine the next steps in developing proper cancer treatments, Matta said. This can be achieved through testing the therapies quickly, safely and cheaply.
“Cancer immunotherapies are one of the hottest areas of cancer research,” said Keck professor Preet Chaudhary, the corresponding author of the study. “To develop more effective and less toxic immunotherapies, it is important to have an assay that can rapidly screen a large number of candidates in a sensitive, fast, economical manner to select the best candidate for further development.”
Named after the El-Matador Beach, the Matador assay makes use of bioluminescent agents to visually display and measure how many cancer cells are being killed by a selected immunotherapy.
“The [agents were] engineered to stay entrapped inside the intact cells, but it gets released after the cells die, and the glow released from them was quantitatively measured using a luminometer,” Matta said.
According to Matta, the technology used in the Matador assay has the potential to impact several fields outside of medicine, including light production, genetically engineered plants and environmental technology.
