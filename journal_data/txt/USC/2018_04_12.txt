Welcome, friends. It’s the best time of the year.
That might sound like a strange thing to say to sports fans when we just finished watching March Madness and the Masters Tournament and are still two weeks away from the NFL Draft. But it’s true: The Stanley Cup Playoffs kicked off on Wednesday, meaning one of the greatest, purest spectacles in the sporting world is now underway.
It’s hard to describe the breakneck pace of playoff hockey — it’s really something you have to witness yourself to fully appreciate. The quest for Lord Stanley’s Cup shifts the sport to a new gear, transforming it into a completely different game for the next two months.
The changes are universal, affecting teams, fans and broadcasters alike. I’ll never forget the unintentional hilarity of commentator Doc Emrick’s constantly cracking voice during triple overtime in Game 1 of the 2013 Finals. And despite Nashville’s loss to Pittsburgh last year, the Predators’ crowd was spellbinding: A choir of nearly 20,000 fans sang in unison at Penguins goalie Matt Murray whenever he conceded a goal, alternating between chants of “Murray! Muuuuuurray! YOU SUCK!” and “IT’S ALL YOUR FAULT! IT’S ALL YOUR FAULT!”
The best part? The atmosphere rubs off on the players. Unlike during the regular season, both teams pursue almost every chipped puck into the offensive zone, and each shot is released with purpose. The hits have an added edge, too. There’s nothing more fun than a playoff line brawl, when tempers boil over and the game devolves into a five-on-five round of fisticuffs.
Fortunately for viewers, this additional speed and intensity also increases the potential for upsets. Los Angeles Kings fans know this better than anyone: Their team lifted the Cup in 2012 as the bottom overall seed in its conference and again in 2014 with the third-worst record out of qualifying teams from the West. Pittsburgh’s back-to-back titles have bucked this trend for the past two seasons, but this year’s championship race appears as open as any in recent memory.
The Kings hope that proves to be true after sneaking into the playoffs as a wild card. At the same time, however, they are looking to avoid getting bulldozed by arguably the biggest Cinderella story in sports — the Vegas Golden Knights.
It may sound like a questionable take after Loyola Chicago just captivated the nation with its journey to the Final Four. But the Knights, who are playing their inaugural season in the NHL, are on an even unlikelier run. Consider this: The Ramblers were the fourth No. 11 seed in NCAA history to reach the national semifinals (the first since VCU in 2011). Vegas, on the other hand, is the first expansion team in the history of professional sports to win its division in its maiden campaign.
In fact, no other team has even debuted with a winning season, let alone the Knights’ sparkling 51-24-7 mark, which was third-best in the Western Conference. Vegas had the sixth overall pick in the entry draft, but hockey prospects rarely make an immediate impact (the franchise’s first-round selection, Cody Glass, is still playing juniors), meaning the roster had to be assembled from NHL benchwarmers during June’s expansion draft. Yet somehow, the Knights enter their first-ever playoff series as the higher seed.
They certainly looked to be the favorite when the Kings visited the T-Mobile Arena to open the series on Wednesday. Going toe-to-toe against a host of former Stanley Cup champions — including 2012 Conn Smythe Trophy winner Jonathan Quick between the pipes — the Knights stood tall to battle to a 1-0 victory.
They leaned on the postseason experience of their own in winger James Neal and goalie Marc-Andre Fleury (who were on opposing ends during last year’s Finals), but 22-year-old Shea Theodore provided the game winner, firing a wrist shot that deflected past Quick for the first postseason goal in the Knights’ history. The roof nearly blew off the arena, and it was clear Vegas would be a difficult rink to steal a win at during the playoffs — which L.A. will have to do in order to advance.
But as usual, the Kings have the squad to pull it off and make a run. The roster’s core is made up of two-time Cup winners, and budding stars Adrian Kempe and Tyler Toffoli will be eager to make an impact in their first taste of postseason action. Despite the loss in Game 1, Quick looked sharp, turning away 27 of 28 shots. That bodes well after he struggled in the regular season finale, especially given his postseason track record. The truest cliche in hockey is that you need a hot goaltender to win the Stanley Cup, and if Quick is on his game, there are few stoppers better than him on the planet.
This series is a paradox of sorts. After two unlikely championship runs, the Kings suddenly find themselves looking to bring a premature end to a different underdog story — except technically, they are the underdogs. But given L.A.’s wealth of playoff experience, you’d have to pick it over Vegas, even after the opening game.
Then again, that’s the narrative the Knights have been bucking all season. They are a Cinderella story in the truest sense: Not only are they crashing a party they have no right to attend, but they also look the part in every way. The clock won’t strike midnight on its own. The Kings — or whichever teams come after them — will have to call time.

During a speech for construction apprentices at an Ohio training facility last Thursday, President Donald Trump exposed his ignorance about the integral role that community colleges have played in broadening access to higher education. “We do not know what a ‘community college’ means,” he said. Trump has since been blasted in the media for the glaring gaps in his knowledge, and rightfully so. 
Di Wu | Daily Trojan
The president should learn what a community college is — and quickly — before he advocates for an increase in vocational schools at the expense of community colleges.  The diminishing numbers of community colleges could disrupt higher education’s ability to close gaps in economic disparities, and in this sense, it would fundamentally upset higher education’s proper functioning. This could especially affect USC.
It’s ironic, then, that much of the motivation behind Trump’s steadfast support for vocational schools — which often prepare workers for infrastructure jobs — most likely stems from his early promises to revive sectors of the U.S. economy that would benefit from larger numbers of vocational graduates. If Trump really wanted to bring job security and prosperity to future generations of Americans — as he repeatedly claims to — then he would acknowledge the role that community colleges play in building a more equitable economy. 
According to the Community College Research Center at Columbia University, during the 2015-16 academic year, 49 percent of students who obtained a bachelor’s degree from a four-year college had, at some point in the preceding 10 years, enrolled at a two-year public institution. Among students identified as low-income (those with a family income under $25,000 annually), 44 percent attended community college as their initial post-graduate schooling and, among first-generation students, 38 percent attended community college for their first institution in that academic year. 
Further, community colleges accept all applicants, granting a recognizable path to a four-year institution for students who lack the resources to attend four-year colleges immediately after high school. Additionally, the relatively low tuition of community colleges, which usually costs less than what a federal Pell Grant can provide, renders community colleges an accessible gateway for students who lack the means to attend a four-year institution immediately after high school graduation. Even for those who do not continue on to four-year colleges, community colleges usually offer associate’s degrees, which are becoming increasingly necessary in an economy that is calling for post-high school training for more and more of its jobs. 
As such, investment in the community college system is not just an investment in U.S. higher education; it’s also an investment in increasing access to it. This is true at USC more so than at almost any other private, four-year university. 
In Fall 2017, USC admitted 2,150 transfer students and around half of them transferred from a California community college. In contrast, Princeton hasn’t accepted a transfer student since 1990. In 2014, Harvard admitted 12 transfer students in total; Yale and Stanford both admitted 29; and Georgetown, despite being known for its transfer acceptance rates, still admitted just 148. It’s unlikely that any of these students came from Santa Monica College or the like; Harvard’s transfer eligibility guidelines, for instance, are seeped in rhetoric that does not extend a very welcoming invitation to students from first-year institutions that are not, well, like Harvard. 
Consequently, USC’s high percentage of transfer students represents a commitment to supporting community college students — and it’s a commitment that cannot wane under Trump’s rhetorical attacks on them, especially considering the lack of nationwide support at other elite private institutions for community college students. To combat the shrouded venom of Trump’s recent comments concerning community colleges and the potential budget cuts that his words may predate, USC must continue to be as unwavering in its high enrollment rates of community college students as it has been for the past decade. 
As noted by the Los Angeles Times, USC began its current levels of recruitment from community colleges 10 years ago, after University President C. L. Max Nikias sought to rectify the findings of a 2006 study that reported that fewer than 1 in 1,000 students at the country’s top private schools were community college transfers. It’s heartening to see that at least one president understands the benefits of community colleges.

Kylie Cheung | Daily Trojan
The past couple of weeks have seen increasingly contentious and threatening dialogue around how women who have abortions should be treated. The Atlantic’s decision to hire Kevin Williamson, a conservative columnist who vocally advocates for the death penalty for the quarter of women who have abortions, drew as much outrage as the publication’s subsequent decision to end their working relationship with Williamson. And the same week The Atlantic decided to sever ties with Williamson, a three-term state senator from Idaho had to walk back on similar statements he made, also supporting the death penalty for those who have abortions. 
Such a belief is undeniably extreme. Contrary to the criticisms of conservative commentators like Erick Erickson, Williamson was not fired for his contrarian “viewpoints” — The Atlantic is notably staffed by multiple abortion rights opponents. The incitement of violence and mass murder against the substantive group  of women who have had an abortion is not merely a “viewpoint,” nor is it merely a contribution to the marketplace of ideas. Rather, it’s a violent and dangerous ideology; such rhetoric normalizes the very real violence and harassment shouldered by abortion providers and women across the country for offering or receiving a legal, necessary medical service.
In 2017, the Feminist Majority Foundation found that 34.2 percent of U.S. abortion providers said they had experienced “severe violence or threats of violence” in the first half of 2016, an increase from the 19.7 percent of clinics who said they had experienced this in 2014. In light of the upward trend of arson and other acts of physical and verbal violence that target providers and women, threatening language about abortion must be understood as more than abstract contrarianism, but as a clear threat to women and health care providers’ livelihoods.
That said, fringe and extreme ideologies more often than not share some foundation with ostensibly moderate politics. On Monday, Arizona’s House of Representatives passed a bill that would require hospitals and clinics to ask women seeking abortion why they want the procedure. The bill’s quiet demand for women to be punished for the procedure may not be as obvious as Williamson’s articulation that women who terminate a pregnancy should be hanged, nor President Donald Trump’s sentiment in 2016 that there must be “some form of punishment” for women who have the procedure. Nonetheless, the bill demands that women who have a legal, but inherently gendered, medical service be treated differently by requiring them to justify what is often a deeply personal decision. It’s a compelling discussion that many patients may understandably feel uncomfortable having.
The bill transparently does not stem from concern for the reasons women want abortions, which could include anything from economic hardship or lack of access to reliable contraception, to simply not wanting to experience the often extreme discomfort of pregnancy. It is supported by Republican lawmakers’ whose track records reveal they are the same people who never cede an opportunity to make abortion less accessible. The bill is widely understood among pro-choice advocates as an invasion of privacy meant to make women feel ashamed for making safe decisions about their bodies. 
And its specifics are even more insidious. The bill delineates certain, charged questions abortion providers must ask patients seeking abortion care: Were they victims of sex trafficking or domestic abuse? Was the pregnancy a result of rape or incest? Were they being coerced? Trafficking, rape and reproductive coercion are all very serious issues of their own accord, but here, we see them being manipulated to undermine the existence and necessity of free reproductive choice. 
The bill’s purpose is to associate the procedure with extreme situations to suggest that abortion is not the common, safe and, once again, legal medical procedure that it is. It suggests only unstable or victimized women would willingly seek to terminate a pregnancy outside of extreme circumstances. And in doing so, it aims to subject women to the guilt and shame that go hand-in-hand with forcing anyone to defend a personal decision. Despite the stigma and cultural fanaticism that abortion remains mired in, it is as legal as a colonoscopy or other situational medical services, and yet, the government does not necessitate questioning, mandatory counseling and justification for any of these services.
Ultimately, it’s important to note that the social or other forms of punishment that go hand-in-hand with having an abortion are hardly evitable. Women who have abortions aren’t irresponsible, and we don’t need to “teach them a lesson” for purportedly making poor choices; the majority of women who have abortions notably used contraception when they conceived, according to Guttmacher. It should go without saying, but women who seek abortion care didn’t “choose” to get pregnant: Whether or not we support stigma and punishment-free reproductive health care is inherently about empathy and compassion.

Rising MC Bishop Nehru took over Los Angeles’ Echoplex on Tuesday night, bringing a taste of his timeless New York sound to the West Coast. The rapper did his best to excite the crowd during his hour on stage, and although he didn’t quite manage to raise the energy to his desired level, he still ultimately delivered a decent performance.
Kenan Draughorne | Daily Trojan
Just last month, Nehru released his new album Elevators: Act I and II, featuring solid production courtesy of KAYTRANADA on Act I and MF DOOM on Act II. The 21-year-old performed plenty of the material from the project, alternating between each act to allow for variety in the soundscape. At one point, he left it up to the audience to choose which producer they wanted to hear from, subsequently launching into “Rollercoasting” after a resounding shout in favor of MF DOOM. 
The energy was at its peak when Nehru interacted with the crowd in instances such as this, connecting him with the audience and allowing his personality to shine through. He often contextualized his songs before diving into them, alerting his fans to pay special attention to the storytelling in each verse on “The Game of Life” in order to fully understand his intended message.
When he attempted to hype up the crowd with trap-influenced, 808 heavy bass lines, however, Nehru was less successful. Determined to turn the night into a party, he gave the crowd a full song’s warning before playing “AreYouKidding?! (77 Version),” although the sparsely populated crowd showed little energy as he jumped about on stage. He saw a stronger reaction from the KAYTRANADA-produced “Get Away,” however, exciting the crowd with the funky, high-energy beat.
Disorganization was another of the evening’s pitfalls, although more of an issue than during Nehru’s. 
Culver City rapper Verbs was given about 30 minutes to win over the crowd, but his self-deprecating personality proved too tiring to adequately enthuse the crowd by the end of his set. Originally, his lackadaisical approach to his performance was somewhat endearing but as the act wore on, he began to blur the line between comedic relief and genuine ineptitude. Frequently, Verbs abruptly cut songs short during the first verse and retreated back to the DJ booth to choose a new song, creating awkward gaps of silence and preventing his set from flowing smoothly.
To a lesser extent, Nehru was guilty of this as well, allowing for brief gaps in the program as he consulted the DJ about what song to play next. Unlike Verbs, however, fans were often quick to chime in about what they wanted to hear next, persuading Nehru to perform “Hands Down” off his 2017 album Emperor Nehru’s New Groove near the end of his set. “Potassium” was another popular suggestion although Nehru chose not to play the song, instead closing the evening with “Highs and Lows” after a motivational message to anyone struggling through difficult situations.
At different parts of his set, Nehru’s a capella verses were well-received by the audience, proving his skill and capability as a lyricist. The show was most enjoyable during these moments as well as when Nehru performed more mellow material, allowing the crowd to nod their heads to the beat in agreement. The song “Welcome,” which saw Nehru rapping over the classic, J Dilla-produced “DFTF,” was a perfect example of this, putting a smile on the faces of many with its relaxed, earthy sound.
It was far from the best concert of Nehru’s burgeoning career, but still showcased him as a talented, renaissance MC driven by a hunger to out rap the best of them. The limited attendance likely played a role in the evening’s shortcomings, but it’s not hard to see Nehru putting on a better performance the next time he’s in Los Angeles, assuming more of the city’s hip-hop heads decide to come out and show their support for the lyricist.

Organized groups scare me. There’s something about a collective body of individuals sharing aggressive laughter, inside jokes, accumulated hours together and common experiences that paralyzes me.
Unsurprisingly, I spent most of my time in high school wandering campus alone or quietly stacking newspapers by myself in the back of the classroom. I’ve never had a solid friend group or a “squad,” if you will. My phone rarely blew up with messages from group texts making weekend plans. I never experienced sitting around a table, chuckling with a ton of friends into the late hours of the night. Rather, I sought out individuals I naturally clicked with and formed tight bonds with them. Still, I wasn’t their only companion and they often chose to spend their time with their previously established, close-knit circles. 
Even now, I don’t know if I have a group at USC that I can confidently deem “my people.” There’s often talk about the Trojan Family, whatever that means. I can’t quite say if I’ve had my fair share of experiences within this so-called web that bleeds cardinal and gold. I’m involved in various activities, have a campus job and talk to people in my major, but I don’t remember the last time I went to a club meeting or sat in a circle and answered a “what’s your favorite ice cream flavor” icebreaker question.  Too often, I’ve approached a meeting room and hesitated, my hand hovering over the doorknob in fear of the potential social rejection waiting for me within the walls. 
“To join a group, you have to get people to like you,” I’ve told myself. I often joke that I’m an acquired taste and it is difficult for me to break through the stiff formalities that come with meeting new people. I often give up before I even begin out of fear of being the newcomer and being subjected to scrutiny. 
Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
Perhantps the bottom line is that I’m afraid of community. I have a deep desire to operate independently despite my need for a solid support system. I fail to realize that groups are essentially made up of individuals just like me. Instead, I often see them as a scary collective otherwise impenetrable to someone like me. It’s hard enough to connect on an individual level with new people, but to open myself up to a group of already-settled people is even more frightening. 
And yet, I also recognize that community is important to combat loneliness, something I feel frequently. Loneliness in the sense that everyone is out and experiencing life together while I’m at home playing the same sad music on repeat. Not a crippling dependency but a feeling of being valued and cared for. That you are more than a passing wave outside the dining halls or a head nod in lecture, or a handshake during a LinkedIn speed networking session. It’s the indescribable feeling of having a mass of supporters to pick you up and cheer you on. We are naturally wired to need others. It’s an innate fact of life and a key to happiness I’ve tried to disregard for years, thinking I could survive alone. As much as organized groups freak me out, there’s no denying that I want to be a part of one because I need to connect with people on a deeper level.
I haven’t found my group yet, and it’s a process of putting myself out there to do so. Of course, I will experience rejection, and I can’t expect to get along with everyone. However, there are plenty of campus clubs that seem friendly and fun and are tailored to all sorts of interests. It’s college — there’s a wealth of opportunities at our fingertips. There’s no rush, though, even if it feels like everyone is becoming a part of something. I haven’t found my community yet within the Trojan Family, but I hope I can utilize my time here at USC well enough to find my place somewhere. 
If you’ve kept up with my column you might have noticed that a lot of these life lessons I pick up end in similar fashion. I come to many epiphanies, but it’s just a matter of taking that next step. So here it is: In recognizing that I need a group of people whom I can support and vice versa, I’m making slow strides to achieving the end goal of having one of my own.

The USC men’s basketball team announced Wednesday that it will add three four-star recruits to next season’s roster.
The program said in a press release that point guard Elijah Weaver, power forward J’Raan Brooks and shooting guard Kevin Porter chose USC as their home for the 2018-19 season.
USC head coach Andy Enfield, who earned a five-year contract extension this past year, praised the well-rounded abilities of his three ESPN 100 recruits in Wednesday’s press release.

“[Brooks] is a talented and versatile player who can play multiple positions,” Enfield said. “[Porter] is a terrific athlete and has the unique ability to avoid the defense and make plays for his teammates. Weaver is a big guard who is a tremendous leader, passer and defender. His overall skill set will immediately help our program.”
As a point guard, Weaver is expected to play a similar role that De’Anthony Melton played during his time at USC.
Weaver not only averaged 23.1 points and 8.7 assists on a Rockledge High School team that won the Florida District 14 6A title, but also averaged 4.3 steals and was named the Florida Class 6A Player of the Year.
Weaver’s 6-foot-5, 215-pound frame allows the guard to score at all three levels, while still distributing the ball and providing key plays on the defensive end — something Melton was known for during his freshman year.

And with a similar, 6-foot-6, 218-pound frame and a similar high school alma mater, Rainier Beach natives Porter and current redshirt junior forward Shaqquan Aaron provide USC with similar playing styles.
After averaging 27 points, 14 rebounds and five assists during his senior year, Porter, Washington’s “Mr. Basketball”, ironically enough lost the Washington state title game to fellow USC commit J’Raan Brooks’ Garfield High squad.
Unlike former USC commit Taeshon Cherry, who is now committed to Arizona State, Brooks recommitted to the Trojans after initially decommitting in the wake of the FBI scandal involving former assistant coach Tony Bland last year.
Brooks is a defensively-stout, 6-foot-9 power forward who not only won a Washington state 3A title in 2018, but was also named Co-Defensive Player of the Year and helped his team to a 28-2 record.

He will join a USC front court that will lose junior forward Chimezie Metu to the NBA Draft, and former three-star Harrison Henderson, who will transfer after this season.
However, role player Victor Uyaelunmo and starters Bennie Boatwright and Nick Rakocevic will remain at the Galen Center next year. It is unclear who from the bunch will get quality minutes in 2018 because starting shooting guard Jonah Mathews, key sixth man Jordan Usher, likely starting small forward Shaqquan Aaron, potential starting point guard Derryck Thornton and former McDonald’s All-American Chuck O’Bannon will all be returning.
Rumors around the college basketball world also suggest USC could potentially land a graduate transfer from another D-I program in the coming weeks, but nothing has been confirmed yet.
Either way, Enfield and the rest of his coaching staff will have a lot of talent at their disposal after losing four starters to the NBA.

The USC women’s lacrosse team is hard at work this week preparing for its final home game on Friday against the San Diego State Aztecs. Before the matchup, the team will celebrate its decorated seniors — goalie Gussie Johns, defender Lydia Sutton and attackers Alexis Kardias and graduate student Maeve McMahon — at their pregame Senior Day festivities.

The Women of Troy, who are currently ranked No. 20 in the nation in the IWLCA coaches’ poll, is looking to snap its three-game losing streak with just two games to go until the Pac-12 championships.
The pressure is on because the team has not lost four games in a row in its history. Despite recent struggles, the Trojans have been able to stand out statistically from the rest of the Pac-12. They lead the conference in goals-against averages (9.05) and caused turnovers (10.36). 
Despite their success in statistics, head coach Lindsey Munday thinks there is still more room for all-around improvement. 
“[We] need to get better, plain and simple,” Munday said. 
One area where the Trojans have been lacking is in draw control, which can act as a great metric of a team’s dominance. Over their three-game losing streak, USC trails in draw controls won, 23-54. 
In their recent encounters, the Trojans have been strong against San Diego State. In their two matchups last year, USC was dominant, winning the first 15-3 and the second 18-7. Last year was indicative of the history between the two teams; the USC women’s lacrosse team has a perfect 6-0 record against the Aztecs.
However, Munday, who boasts a 76-37 record all-time, guaranteed that the Trojans are focused on Friday’s game rather than their past success against the Aztecs. When asked if the team’s mindset had been affected by the history of success against San Diego State, Munday quickly responded, “Not at all,” before adding that the team is “focusing on taking this one game at a time” and doing what it needs to do as a team, week in and week out.
Munday’s mindset has spread to some members of the team, looking toward their Friday game against San Diego State.
“We’re a new team this year, they’re a new team this year,” McMahon said. “Whatever happened last year is in the past.” 
The Aztecs (8-6 overall record) are sitting on a three-game losing streak of their own, two of which were lost by a narrow 1-goal defeat. San Diego State will be a challenge that should not be overlooked by the Trojans. Overall, the Aztecs bring forth an impressive season and a strong roster to McAlister Field. 
San Diego State’s roster touts dominant players such as: junior midfielder Jill Haight, who leads the team with 31 goals, eight assists for 39 points and 60 draw controls to lead SDSU; junior midfielder Harlowe Steele, who has racked up 28 goals this season; and senior midfielder Elizabeth Rourke, the team’s distributor, who leads with 15 assists. The Aztecs’ goalie, Katy Sharretts, has started all but one game and has an impressive 12.05 goals-against average.
In spite of the recent upsets in the Women of Troy’s schedule, the team has been strong at home this season, posting a 4-2 record at McAlister Field. In its coming game, USC will need to rely on its three players who have made it onto the watch list for the Tewaaraton Award — the award given annually to the best player nationally. The Trojan’s leading scorer, sophomore midfielder Kerrigan Miller, All-American defender Lydia Sutton and All-Region goalie Gussie Johns have been linked to the award. Each of the above-mentioned players have been named Pac-12 Player of the Week at least once this season — Johns has picked up the award twice.
Since the start of the program, USC has risen in the rankings, showing no signs of slowing down, especially with the support of Munday. All things considered, the Trojans have been working hard not only as a team but on individual improvements as well. The presence of the Aztecs will not be taken lightly, as the team has certainly proved itself this year. The Women of Troy hope to come away with a win in the seniors’ last game at McAlister Field and ultimately put an end to their losing skid.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
Sometimes, something happens in sports that doesn’t quite fit the narrative — like when Patrick Reed won the Masters on Sunday.
Golf is a unique sport in that people are far too polite to get into Twitter fights or boo golfers on the course. Everybody gets a cheer or round of applause when they finish a hole, no matter who they are or how many strokes it took (hence, the phrase “golf clap”). 
So when Reed clinched the Masters with a putt on the 18th hole, the fans cheered because it’s proper decorum. But if this had been another sport, there would definitely have been boos;  almost nobody wanted Reed to win.
There is a backstory for Reed. He is not built like an athlete, he is estranged from his parents and he is generally regarded as a lone-wolf in the sport. When his fellow golfers are socializing on the driving range, he’s got his earbuds in. He has a troubled past, having been kicked off his college team at the University of Georgia for allegedly cheating and stealing from teammates, as well as an arrest for underage drinking. On the pro tour, he has been criticized for shushing fans and calling himself a “top-five player” despite being ranked nowhere near the top five. And then there was the time he uttered a gay slur after missing a putt.
It was no surprise, then, when Reed received far quieter applause than his playing partner, Rory McIlroy, did before the final round, despite Reed entering the day with the lead. Throughout the day, loud cheers erupted when fan-favorites such as McIlroy, Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth sank putts to cut into Reed’s lead, as opposed to the tepid clapping for Reed. With Tiger Woods out of contention, the saving grace would have to be one of the sport’s well-liked stars winning the tournament — and if not that, anyone but Reed.
But he won, clinching his first major tournament and donning the coveted Masters Green Jacket. Then came all the stories about his past, painting him as a disingenuous outsider who stole the trophy from more-deserving golfers. He was even (rightfully) blasted on Twitter after the CBS announcers revealed his affinity for Imagine Dragons, a band as generic as it is uninspiring.
Music tastes notwithstanding, Reed was a villain. Not only did the villain win, but he also did so in a way that is difficult to reconcile with. This is not like a “hated” team winning a championship. When Alabama wins in college football or Duke in college basketball or the New England Patriots in the NFL, it conforms to the proper villain narrative. It is more of a “playful” hate, almost respectful in a sense. 
Patrick Reed is not the Patriots. He is an antagonist with character flaws that have turned him into a persona non grata in the game of golf. There is no respect here. He has been maligned by fans, rejected by his peers, cast aside by the sport. And he’s also the reigning Masters champion.
That is what makes us squirm, that something happened outside of the scope of both what we wanted and expected to happen. This aspect of sports — the judgement, the narrative-forming — is not ideal. Reed has absolutely done some bad things in the past, but he is not O.J. Simpson. We aren’t even giving him a chance to show that he might have changed. We have signed, sealed and delivered him as a villain, forcing him to defend himself in what should have been the greatest moment of his golf career.
The only way Reed can change minds is if he keeps winning and makes do with increased time in the spotlight. That is the only way to flip this new narrative, and only then will the crowd actually cheer when he sinks a putt.

Trojan Advocates for Political Progress hosted a forum on gun violence on Wednesday at Taper Hall. 
The organization invited members from Unruh Associates, USC College Democrats, Trojans for Israel, Political Student Assembly, USC Students for Justice in Palestine and Young Americans for Freedom to speak about their stances on gun regulation. 
Price School of Public Policy professor Erroll Southers moderated the panel. Annalise Pasztor | Daily Trojan
“I wanted to keep up the dialogue after different situations, whether or not that is the Parkland shooting or other instances of police brutality,” TAPP President Alec Vandenberg said. “Gun violence is still prevalent, and we want to make sure we can shine the light on that and the first step to doing that is starting that dialogue and taking that dialogue and forming a consensus and acting upon it.”
The forum consisted of a panel of student representatives from each of the host clubs and was moderated by professor Erroll  Southers. Southers said that it is important to address gun control, especially on school campuses.
“This is a conversation that we always say we’re going to have and we never have,” Southers said. “I think that schools are particularly concerned about when talking about gun violence these days, so I think that it’s the absolutely perfect place to have this discussion.”
Before working at USC, Southers worked as an FBI Special Agent, served as former President Barack Obama’s first nominee for the Transportation Security Administration Assistant Secretary and also served as Assistant Chief of Homeland Security and Intelligence for the Los Angeles World Airports Police Department under Calif. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
Given the heightened relevance of gun violence in the wake of this year’s mass shootings, Southers proposed several questions to stimulate discussion.
Topics included students’ opinions on arming teachers, whether handguns or firearms in general were a concerns, if the Second Amendment should be amended or removed and how to make gun use safer. 
“A lot of people notice that many of these conversations around gun violence, many of the arguments and debates, when it’s specifically about gun violence, never include the rampant gun violence by the police forces, by white supremacists,” Kameron Hurt, a junior majoring in international relations and a member of Students for Justice in Palestine, said. “To certain people, gun violence only matters when it’s against a certain community and if it’s done in a mass way where a lot of people are killed in one instant, but if it’s a slow and grueling ‘one murder today, another murder tomorrow’ then suddenly loses that importance.” 
Vandenberg said this conversation was made more dynamic by Southers’ willingness to discuss his own experiences. Southers said the event provided some consensus on certain issues such as background checks as prerequisites for gun ownership as well as whether it is  time to re-evaluate certain laws. 
“I want students to know that we can have this discussion,” Southers said. “There are solutions and that the people sitting in the room today, they’re a part of that solution. It’s going to be laws and it’s going to be people that make sure those laws are suggested and acted, followed through … We are the solution. If our elected officials aren’t going to move the needle, then we need to move the needle.”

Law professor Heidi Rummel points to a piece of art she keeps on the wall in her office. It’s a painting by one of her clients, Ruben Ruiz, a former convict. Ruiz was released from prison five months ago — thanks to the help of USC’s Post-Conviction Justice Project that Rummel co-directs. Ruiz had been in prison for 26 years, 12 of which were spent in solitary confinement after he was charged with a “special circumstance” murder at 17.

“I had the idea that I was going to die in prison,” Ruiz said. “I was moved by the fact they were willing to help. I had never had anybody that I didn’t know come into my life and do something for me, let alone fight for my freedom.” 
Ruiz said he owes a lot to Rummel and calls her a great friend. 
“There [are] some people that you come across in life that you just want to get to know and she’s certainly that person for me,” Ruiz said. “Whenever we talk, I always walk away with a greater perspective.”
Years before she met Ruiz, Rummel served as a criminal prosecutor from 1996 to 2005, working to seek justice for victims and put criminals behind bars. In 2006, the director of the Post-Conviction Project invited her to join the program. Initially, Rummel was unsure, but she was open to see how she felt. It didn’t take long before she realized she was right at home. Her passion would inevitably emerge for her clients, their cases and the reforms she brought to the system.
“Even though I’m fighting on the other side of the table, I do feel like I’m fighting for fairness and justice in the process, for people who are left behind and for a process that was patently unfair,” Rummel said. 
Today, she is the co-director of a 30-year program at the Gould School of Law which gives juveniles and female convicts who are sentenced to life without parole a chance at    resentencing. It also serves as a learning experience for law students by providing them with opportunities to work on real cases.
“When students come to me, they have a foundation in the law,” Rummel said. “They understand how to read a case, how to make a legal argument, how to analyze the law and they move from that foundation into being true advocates for their clients.” 
For Rummel, at every stage of her career, she is moved to fight for justice. She has fought for civil rights, hate crime and police misconduct cases, all while working as a federal prosecutor in the United States attorney’s office.
Rummel said she recognized gaps in the criminal justice system and worked to improve the landscape through legislative reform. 
“I really feel passionate about fighting for people who don’t have anyone fighting for them and haven’t had their rights protected by the system,” she said. 
Design by Karan Nevatia | Daily Trojan
Jihyuk Song, a third-year law student, worked on Ruiz’s case with Rummel. Now, Song travels to prisons across California with Ruiz and  speaks to juvenile convicts about their experiences and goals of rehabilitation. 
“Just four months ago I was visiting [Ruiz] in prison,” Song said. “Now he’s visiting prisons with me and able to help, and seeing that is great.”
Ruiz is the project’s most recent client to be released from prison early. He said that spending time in solitary confinement allowed him to reflect on his life. These reflections influenced him to adopt Eastern meditation techniques and become an avid reader. He was also able to earn two college degrees behind bars. 
“I was able to transform my life and become the person I am today because of that time that I spent in [solitary confinement],” Ruiz said. “It humbled me, and it changed my life.”
After spending more than two decades in prison, Ruiz said he is still adjusting to life as a free man. He looks forward to spending time with his family, helping his mother manage her business and working with the project that helped set him free. 
“Just seeing how [Rummel] impacts so many lives, her dedication and commitment, I have definitely grown to really enjoy the experience that she’s introduced me to,” Ruiz said. “I want to keep paying it forward.”
And Rummel, she said she isn’t going to stop helping people like Ruiz. Her goals are to continue improving the criminal justice system, and fighting for her clients. 
“I think we’re moving from a system where you are defined by your crime and nothing else,” Rummel said. “We’re starting to look at the human being, at what is right for you, what you deserve, what will punish you and heal you, and I really hope we continue to move in that direction.”
