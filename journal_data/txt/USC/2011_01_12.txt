“Quite a while back, we started looking for California locations. One of the reasons we chose to come back to California is because the original Freebirds is at UCSB,” said Jeff Carl, chief marketing officer for Tavistock Freebirds. “We asked, ‘where would be a great site for that first return to California after being in Texas for 20 years,’ and found this location to be a natural fit.”
The restaurant held several kick-off events this week offering complimentary food and drinks to guests who made a $5 donation. The donations benefitted  The Art of Elysium and Union Rescue Mission, respectively.
“We’ve seen an interesting balance of students, faculty and community members, and also employees from businesses around here, such as the bank and the car dealership across the street,” Carl said. “We’re interested in serving the entire community.”
This will be the first and only Freebirds to serve breakfast, including breakfast burritos, tacos, horchata, coffee and “crunchy tacos,” which are rolled in crumbled tortillas.
Freebirds opens at 6:30 a.m. on weekdays and 10:30 a.m. on weekends. It closes at 10:30 p.m. Monday through Wednesday, 1:30 a.m. Thursday through Saturday and 9:30 p.m. on Sunday.

The Ronald Tutor Campus Center is now home to an additional attraction: an extremely rare, 2,000-year-old ancient Greek sculpture, of which there is only one other known replica in existence currently residing in the Louvre in Paris.
Love · The 2,000-year-old Dart Aphrodite is now housed in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The only other copy is in the Louvre. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
The Dart Aphrodite is a product of the ancient Roman practice of making copies of ancient Greek pieces to preserve aging artwork. USC’s Dart Aphrodite will be displayed outside the Admission Center on the second floor of the Campus Center against the recycled glass wall.
The sculpture is a slightly larger than life-size head of Aphrodite, the ancient Greek goddess of love. The head is all that remains of the original piece, as the rest of the body has been lost over time.
Part of the goddess’ nose has been scraped off, but overall the piece is in surprisingly good condition, said Cindy Robinson, educational program coordinator at the Campus Center.
“This piece will be beautiful, convenient and educational,” Robinson said. “We’re going to have an artifact on campus and professors, students and guests alike are going to seek it out and study it.”
In the mid-1990s, the piece’s owner, actress Jane O’Brien Dart, patron of the arts and donor of the Roski School of Fine Arts at USC, invited then-Dean of the School of Fine Arts John Pollini to visit her while the Dart Aphrodite was at her home in Los Angeles.
“I thought [the Dart Aphrodite] was an interesting piece so I did more research on it and eventually wrote an article on the head,” said Pollini, who is now a professor of classical art and archeology in the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
Pollini published his article 15 years ago, and when Dart passed away in April 2009, her son Stephen got in touch with Pollini and decided to donate the artwork to USC.
“I had met Stephen earlier when I met Jane as I first saw the piece,” Pollini said. “He remembered me and my article and decided to donate the Dart Aphrodite to USC.”
The sculpture was donated to USC’s archeology lab, where it arrived in late November for examination. Robinson said that although the archeology lab officially owns the piece, it is on permanent loan to the Campus Center.
“We don’t have any kind of date set for when the piece might be removed,” Robinson said. “If it were to be removed, it would be in a very long time and it would have to be for extenuating circumstances.”
After being examined at USC, the piece was sent to a shop in Pasadena for a custom-made glass installation case. Because of the specific style and weight of the sculpture, the installation piece includes a special mount that goes into a hole at the bottom of the neck.
Pollini said that since the university does not currently have any other major pieces of ancient Greek or Roman art, the acquisition of the Dart Aphrodite is important to the USC community.
“This is literally something you would possibly study in an art history or archeology-minded class, so the fact that we’re going to have it on campus and see it in person is going to be infinitely more valuable than studying it in a book,” Robinson said. “It really makes being able to study it in this context priceless.”

Los Angeles is home to astounding artists that reach beyond the mainstream, and to not utilize the convenience of talent at one’s fingertips is ludicrous.
Among the gifted artists is one of my new favorites Lucy Schwartz. At just twenty years old, the born and raised Angelino has already written, performed and independently produced two Oscar contenders (for Shrek Forever After and Mother and Child) and the international theme song for the hit television show Parenthood; has had songs featured in several other television shows such as Grey’s Anatomy, No Ordinary Family, Make It or Break It, ER and Brothers and Sisters; has toured with The Weepies and has had So You Think You Can Dance’s Sonya Tayeh choreograph her music video.

With such a stacked résumé, you’d think she’s been working under a heavy, music label, but she’s been doing things herself under the endearingly named label “Fortunate Fool Records.” Her very likable, distinct, upbeat, indie, pop style matched with a memorable voice is definitely a great sound to groove to on a sunny day, and also one to turn a dark mood light.
Every track on her recently released album, “Life in Letters,” has different kinds of admirable, lighthearted qualities to them, whether it is a random ukulele riff in the middle or a clap/snap rhythm in place of drums. She’s definitely got a long and successful career ahead of her.
My Top Picks: “My Darling,” “Life in Letters,” “I Want the Sky” and “Seven Hours” feat. Aqualung.
Check her out on iTunes, www.myspace.com/lucysong or www.lucyschwartzmusic.com.

Why not wait until the beginning of a semester to start procrastinating with a little instant yet strange cinematic gratification? Here are my top 5 obscure picks from the internet’s famed red vault.
WAITING FOR GUFFMAN (1996)
This late 90s mockumentary may just be the funniest movie that no one saw. Director Christopher Guest’s portrait of an overzealous, Midwestern production preparing for a famous Broadway critic features an ensemble cast of the awkward, including a delightfully gawking Eugene Levy and a bouncing Parker Posey.
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: NO RESERVATIONS, SEASON 1 (2005)
He’s opinionated, potty-mouthed and hungry. Anthony Bourdain is the fearless gourmet cowboy we all aspire to be but are too chicken to become. Live vicariously through Bourdain’s delicious explorations of other cities – and the accompanying, biting commentary.
EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP (2010)
Want to raise your cultural IQ? Watch this deeply satirical documentary made by infamous street artist Banksy and revel in its blend of rare footage of esteemed guerrilla artists doing what they do best as well as what becomes of one impassioned man determined to film them all. Exploring the line between hype, art and commercialism, this much buzzed about film may give you just enough cultural currency to impress someone at a party – or a job interview.
LEAVING LAS VEGAS (1995)
Think you may be drinking too much? Watching Nicolas Cage drink his character to death will make you never want to take shots again. Cage’s performance is unforgettable to boot.
THE MACHINIST (2004)
Christian Bale’s extreme dedication to his role in this deeply disturbing psychological thriller about an insomnia-ridden man will make you question what is reality and what is not.

With a mix of styles ranging from ska to crooner, jazz to rockabilly, Cake briskly rose to fame under the 1990s’ wonderfully broad and diverse “alternative rock” umbrella.
Vocalist John McCrea spouted out witty, non-sequitur lyrics that somehow meshed with the music but still broke away from the norm.
Cake was the perfect band for the decade, when genres were crossing over more than ever and movements like swing were coming back to popularity.
Almost 20 years after the band’s formation, things aren’t the same in the music world. The alt-rock umbrella splintered into dozens of subgenres throughout the last decade and lo-fi sensibilities dethroned the once-resurgent big band sound. Cake’s witty lyrical stylization could be seen as superfluous among today’s pop-culture-laden, post-ironic acts.
But now, more than five years since their last album, Cake is back with a new release and a surprising new sound. Showroom of Compassion is unmistakably a Cake album, but with its slower tempo, contemplative content and use of different instruments, it clearly stands apart from the band’s prior releases.
Part of the new sound comes from previously unused instruments such as the acoustic piano. This move toward a less electric ambience gives Showroom of Compassion a rawer element. Instead of fast-paced, swing-revival dance music, the album, and the band, aim for a more methodical, precise style. The focus isn’t how the listener interacts with the music, but what the music actually says.
The opening song, “Federal Funding,” is a surprisingly stripped down, quiet song. The lyrics are witty, but the music is not as bouncy as Cake’s standard material.
The second track, “Long Time,” is much more engaging, picking up the pace with the band seeming more energized. A mix of tropicalia and ballad, the song is a solid taste of the band’s new sound.
Even the fast paced songs have a contemplative touch: mellow, but still driven by a pulsing beat and that jazz-esque flare of horns.
The album’s fifth track, “Mustache Man,” is the first song that really sounds like classic Cake. Featuring a soaring trumpet, the song adds background shouts from the rest of the band and random snippets of unintelligible words while still sounding smooth.
There’s a sleek, cohesive element from the band on display here — that big band sound that Cake does very well.
The song is also a great showcase for McCrea’s wordplay. He paints characters in quick, oddball sketches, like the song’s titular man: He is that politician that is practicing his speech / he is racing, he is pacing, he is sleeping on his feet. Along with the first single, “Sick of You,” Cake demonstrates that they can still create worthy dance music.
There’s a definite sense the album title sets the tone of the songs, with a strong lyrical focus on comfort and empathy. Many songs focus on getting over rough times or lost relationships, like the downcast “Got to Move” and “What’s Now is Now.”
But McCrea’s lyrical wit disappears entirely in the next track, “Teenage Pregnancy.” Entirely devoid of lyrics, the instrumental song seems to be trying to tell a story simply through the music. Piano-driven, the song goes from bouts of low tempo to swells of emotion-riddled notes.
“Easy to Crash” signals a change of style that continues throughout the second half of the album. It has a harder edge and feels more like a modern alternative rock track. The guitar and percussion are more emphasized, and it’s only the electric keyboard section that feels really Cake-ish.
To break up the sound, “Bound Away” introduces a folk-country hybrid, with the more jazzy elements of Cake’s style completely missing. It’s a travelogue of sorts, with the narrator heading abroad to get away from some unfortunate incident. It’s an outlier of a song but it sets the tone for the remainder of the album.
The album closer, “Italian Guy,” is a return to McCrea’s character-crafting lyricism, if not the dance elements of the rest of the band’s trademark style. It’s a fitting final track, though, and a mix of the old and the new.
Showroom of Compassion is a puzzling entry in Cake’s discography, but it’s still a hopeful sign for the band. McCrea and company prove that they can and have grown as musicians. They’re more experimental, though experimental for Cake is the inverse of how most bands would change things up.
It might not be the iconic sound that diehard fans remember from Cake, but it’s evolutionary.
Showroom of Compassion is a solid album, one that can still get listeners dancing, but also make them stop and think.

One might think of hippies as symbols of the past and of the 1960s as the days when rebellious, fun-loving adolescents hooked up and sported loose-flowing natural-fiber shirts, unwashed long hair and peace signs.
Love is in the air · The musical goes beyond simply creating unity between fictional characters and reaches out to the audience, creating a participatory and interactive experience for the whole audience. -  Photo courtesy of  Broadway L.A.     
Hair does little to dispel this stereotype.
Instead, it gleefully plays with this image, stretching it out with colorful, psychedelic abandonment. The musical’s energetic cast doesn’t just dance — it frolics, writhes, gropes, moons and grinds between woozy sessions of passing joints and chanting for freedom, peace and love.
Hair is a rock musical set in the 1960s during the Vietnam War and the hippie era. When it first opened on Broadway in 1968, it was met with controversy and mixed reviews, but became a huge financial success by 1970.
The show’s popularity spread from Finland to Japan to Israel and even the former Yugoslavia.
Under the direction of Diane Paulus, Hair was revived once again in 2007. It has been on a national tour since last October, presently shaking up the crowd at the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles. It’s a production you don’t want to miss.
The simplest, most superficial way to define Hair’s plot is a group of kids in 1960s New York gathering together as a tribe and reveling in self-proclaimed freedom from society’s rules and war’s brutality.
This philosophy is presented through its trademark opening song “Aquarius,” sung first in solo with dewy assurance from tribe member Dionne (Phyre Hawkins), and then echoed by the rest of the tribe in celebration of the “Age of Aquarius,” which they believe symbolizes a period of love, light and humanity.
But their battle hits too close to home when one of the main characters, Claude (Paris Remillard), gets a draft notice.
It then becomes clear that Hair is not just a story about a tribe of hippies protesting against the older generation’s social conventions and cruel war.
Much like their drug highs, the highs of idealism never lasts.
The tribe is mourning the evanescence of youth as they face imminent transition into the adult world of responsibilities and social law. They struggle with the timeless quest for self-identity in an ever-changing world.
In truth, they are just a bunch of scared, frightened kids trapped in a stifling world and complex time.
During the tribe’s “Be-In” movement, during which each member burns their draft card in protest, Claude agonizes, “Why do I live? Why do I die? Tell me, where do I go?” and finally refuses to burn his draft card.
It is one of Hair’s most touching scenes, and Remillard belts out his anguish with such soul and passion that the audience sits transfixed and aching with him.
Another notable character is Berger (Steel Burkhardt), who contrasts with Claude’s agonized position between the alternative hippie lifestyle and society’s broader expectations.
Berger is a flamboyant personification of hippie ideals. Perpetually stoned, he embraces his tribe’s beliefs with both grandness and goofiness. Those unknowing souls seated in the front row should prepare to be groped, mussed and flashed by Berger in a loincloth.
Remillard and Burkhardt’s portrayals of their characters are brilliant and endearing, but every other character deserves accolades as well, from the child-like, sex-crazed Woof (Matt DeAngelis) to the vulnerable, sensuous Sheila (Caren Lyn Tacket).
Because the show is all about freedom and individuality, it makes sense that the dancing appears free-flowing and spontaneous.
Choreographer Karole Armitage has done an impressive job on the choreography by injecting enough precision to give the tribe’s wiggles and twists a collective unity, while still infusing enough spirited idiosyncrasies to let each member retain their natural personality and warmth.
Each member is gifted with a powerful, soulful voice but their unique strength is the ability to bare all without a hint of self-consciousness.
One might imagine empathizing with what the characters believe, but the only people blushing during their bawdy gestures and scenes of nudity are the theater patrons themselves.
Paulus’ Hair production thrives on this organic, natural interaction with the audience.
From start to finish, the show leaps out from a contained stage performance to an exuberant invitation for everyone to let loose and celebrate all the good things left in life.
By the end of the show, you can’t help but want to jump up, shake and sing along, which is exactly what the audience did on Sunday night’s performance and is characteristic of virtually every performance.
After the bowing and standing ovation, performers, audience, lights and music meshed together into one jubilant party on the stage, hands held together, bodies swaying and singing the finale, “Let the Sunshine In,” together.
In one single moment, the age of the hippies is brought back to life.

You probably aren’t conscious of it all the time, but the fact remains: Food is life. At the very least, it’s true from a literal point of view. After all, what’s more essential than food? Technically water and air, but that’s a conceit. Think about it: Food is everywhere, and in a smorgasbord of flavors, volumes and textures.
Within this venerable rainbow of edibles, one particular item holds a special spot in America’s heart: meat. Any meat. Red meat, white meat, the other white meat, whatever.
Whether it’s beautifully aged and seared, smoked until it falls apart or even served on a bun straight from a pool of dirty water, meat is a food group woven deeply into the cloth of the American eating tradition (sorry, vegans).
But although many people love to eat meat, most wouldn’t be able to face their food and witness the transformation of a living, breathing animal into a sizzling filet mignon.
This might be a bit of a conundrum for us carnivores.
Slaughtering animals and harvesting all their gristly parts is not necessarily pleasant, but it’s still a process appreciated and accepted in many of the world’s great food cultures. The United States, unfortunately, is not yet one of those places.
Have you ever seen a tourist in Chinatown wrinkling their nose at a live chicken about to be prepared or expressing disgust at a whole roasted duck with its head still attached in a window? Ever been that tourist?
It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that the average American is turned off by reminders that they are eating something that was once alive. Most people aren’t even used to fish served with their heads on, let alone chicken feet or lovingly braised lamb’s intestines.
Most modern supermarkets sell pre-butchered meat parts in shiny plastic-wrapped Styrofoam receptacles. They resembled the original animal as much as a bunch of carrots. Offal (the entrails and organs of butchered animals) is rarely seen, only found at exotic locales, such as ethnic markets.
Live fish or poultry, freshly prepared? Forget it. Even the full-service butcher shop, the go-to place for many a ’50s housewife, is an endangered species these days.
This brings us back to that carnivore’s conundrum: Should we be eating meat if we can’t stomach the process of slaughtering an animal and carving it down to the steak on our plate?
I love my animal-derived foodstuffs, but there is something to be said for being fully aware of where your food comes from. “Know your food” has become the mantra of the enlightened foodie.
People clearly care about the condition of their drinking water and the air they breathe and yet turn a blind eye toward much of the food we consume, meat being the most significant of all. Factory farmed? Improperly slaughtered? Who knows? Who cares?
There are two issues at hand:
The first is that there ought to be a constant respect for the fact that eating meat results in animals being killed.
The second is that this involves understanding, even embracing, the process of slaughter.
Acknowledging the source and demanding quality could bring reformation to the increasingly industrialized, money-first nature of animal farming, and being more cognizant of the entire cycle of meat consumption could bring positive changes.
At the very least, you might as well challenge yourself as an eater by exposing yourself to it. Kill It, Cook It, Eat It, a new BBC program that premiered Jan. 11 on Current TV, is an opportunity to do just that.
The show features volunteers who travel to a farm and follow an animal from the caretaking stage all the way through slaughter and eventually to the dinner plate.
It pledges to “tackles tough issues in a tasteful manner,” and the show will certainly be something new for American viewers, perhaps mandatory viewing for anyone who consumes meat.
And if you find yourself too repulsed to watch?
Well, that’s a bit of a conundrum.

Some might shy away from museums given that they can be perceived as cold and uninviting. Most are full of an extensive list of rules and regulations: no flash photography, keep a certain distance from the artwork and don’t touch anything.  
The Suprasensorial: Experiments in Light, Color and Space exhibit at the Geffen Contemporary Museum, an extension of MOCA, subverts the stereotype of dull, quiet and unwelcoming museums.
The exhibit encourages viewers to have a complete sensory experience while interacting with a psychedelic world of neon lights and interesting spaces. Acknowledging its identity as contemporary art, every piece strays from the traditional and actively engages the viewer’s interest and participation.
The exhibition features innovative Latin American artists like Jesús Rafael Soto and Lucio Montana. Its modernity and contemporary style allow the viewer to embrace each work, whether that means running through nylon cables and feeling their vibrations or walking through uniquely lit rooms.
As indicated by the exhibit’s title, Suprasensorial, one must utilize every sense to get the full experience.
In Hélio Oiticica’s and Neville D’Almeida’s progressive “Cosmococa-Programa in Progress,” viewers swim in a pool while looking at surrounding artwork and projections of John Cage’s book Notations. The artists push boundaries even further by including a modern, instrumental soundtrack and incorporating manuscripts made of cocaine, an unprecedented occurrence.
The interactivity of each work encourages viewers to think about their relationship to space.
This is particularly relevant to Julio le Parc’s “Lumiere en Mouvement” which uses a series of mirrors to transport the viewer to an ocean-like, entrancing world in which the room feels bigger than its actual size. Le Parc uses a spotlight to reflect the light and widen the space between simple materials like drywall mirrors, stainless steel and nylon.
The idealized expansion of size and transportation to a deep, mystical, oceanic world pushes the laws of physics and allows viewers to see time and space in a more fantastical, Alice in Wonderland manner.
Each piece is valuable in its own right, but one artist stands out above the rest: Carlos Cruz Diez.
When one first enters “Chromosaturación,” its meaning can be a bit perplexing. There are three large rooms colored by fluorescent lights — the first is green, followed by red then blue.
The lighting is undeniably moody and might drastically alter one’s state of mind from relaxed to passionate to depressed. The work touches on the idea of voyeurism and letting others into your emotions; a passerby can look through three windows and witness participants in each room having their complete sensorial and emotional experiences.
Though this and the other contemporary works are interesting to look at aesthetically, their messages aren’t always clear. For that purpose, guide books and documentaries featuring the artists are available for the viewers’ benefit. Diez’s documentary elaborates on his technique, describing how he systematically places two colors next to each other to form another color within a color, making his style a mathematical form of art.
The precision and thought that goes into Diez’s work makes it all the more intriguing; knowing how much effort manifests in his pieces increases the viewers’ appreciation. Diez is truly an innovative thinker, a master at his craft and an indispensable contemporary artist.
The abstract, conceptual shapes and meanings of contemporary art can be confusing, but Suprasensorial finds an excellent balance between progressive, aesthetically pleasing and understandable artwork. Given the $5 admission fee and the looming exhibit closing date of Feb. 27, you had better get in and see it while you can.

In today’s world, the ocean isn’t as pleasant as our childhood friends Ariel and Flounder led us to believe.
Our marine life is in a state of crisis. The best example of this is the yearly slaughter of more than 20,000 dolphins and porpoises in Taiji, Japan. Students might think we have bigger issues to care about, but we must be proactive to save the dolphin populations, our coastal economies, our health and our consciences.
This sensitive issue is best portrayed in the Oscar-winning documentary The Cove, an honest portrayal of Richard O’Barry’s search for redemption after catalyzing the dolphin craze and the resultant slaughter by working on the hit show Flipper.
Through training these marine mammals, he discovered the deeply rooted connections humans share with dolphins. He also realized how it is inhumane to keep them in captivity. O’Barry took responsibility for his actions, dedicating the last 35 years to tearing down the industry.
The reality is this: Every year, tens of thousands of dolphins are killed in the process of looking for those few live-show dolphins that can sell for as much as $150,000 each. If the depletion continues at this rate, the world’s fish population will collapse in a mere 40 years.
It’s unfathomable that people are so willing to do anything to make a quick buck. Do fishermen care about the sake of our oceans? If not, they should at least think about how their coastal industries will suffer and the deformities that mercury poisoning will inflict on their children and grandchildren.
Progress has been made. Organizers like O’Barry are knocking on doors, making phone calls, getting signatures, gathering volunteers and spreading the word against dolphin cruelty, even among Japanese citizens — yet the slaughter continues.
The glass might be half full now, but it is not enough until the atrocity ends.
It can be easy to forget about these bigger issues with all that we have going on in our personal lives, especially since our secluded USC bubble isn’t right on the ocean. Everyone gets distracted at times, but it is critical that we don’t just stand by and watch as helpless dolphins are brutally slaughtered.
If we allow the atrocity to continue, the results will only be more drastic.
Not all of us can be Richard O’Barry, but we have  the potential to contribute, be it signing a petition or writing to our representatives. We can all do our part in 2011.

@Stacie
The fishermen of Taiji have been hunting dolphins and whales for at least 400 years. Dolphin and whale meat has been a part of their diet for 400 years, as well. That’s a fact.
Now, in some parts of Japan, dolphins are viewed as pests and are killed. However, the meat from the dolphins that are killed is used and not wasted.
@ Henry: The hunting of dolphins has only been big since the 1970s. A few centuries years ago the first dolphins were killed because some fishermen were hungry. Today the fishermen kill the dolphins so as to eradicate the “pests”.
A very nice article. However, factually incorrect. Approx. 20,000 dolphins and porpoises are killed in JAPAN every year, not Taiji. Only about 1,800 are killed in Taiji. The majority, about 80%, are killed in Iwate, Japan.
“The reality is this: Every year, tens of thousands of dolphins are killed in the process of looking for those few live-show dolphins that can sell for as much as $150,000 each.”
This is also incorrect. The hunting of dolphins in Taiji has been taking place for at least 400 years. Long before dolphins began to be captured for aquariums and live-shows.

The end of each December heralds the usual quixotic resolution to lose 40 pounds, the customary “Year in Review” articles, the standard rehashing of already irrelevant pop culture references, the habitual pats on the back for another year completed.
But instead, maybe we can strive to be more aware of our surroundings.

For example, we clearly don’t seem to be picky about what we eat. Although more than 4 million people died of starvation and 1 billion people suffered from hunger (a record, according to the U.N.), the United States alone threw away almost half of its edible food — enough calories feed 200 million people through all of 2010.
When we are not wasting our natural resources, we are contaminating and destroying them.
The British Petroleum oil spill, which lasted 86 days, was a voracious spill of more than 4.9 million barrels of crude oil — enough, if refined, to fill 6 million cars — into an already delicate marine ecosystem.
And we attempt to turn a blind eye to how we damage the environment.
According to NASA, 2010 was the hottest year ever documented, with a record high of 128.3 degrees in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan.
But at the same time, media coverage of climate change plummeted in 2010 — down 30 percent from 2009. “I can’t believe [coverage is] this little,” Drexel University professor Robert Brulle told the Daily Climate causing even him to question his data.
Our ability to glaze over pressing issues apparently extended to the Twitter-verse as well: Lady Gaga generated more chatter than healthcare reform, the oil spill, WikiLeaks, the Haiti earthquake or our ongoing war in the Afghanistan. Currently, Justin Bieber has more than 300,000 more followers than the President of the United States.
And under said president’s jurisdiction, the 2010 U.S. Department of Defense’s budget bloated to $663.8 billion.
The National Science Foundation received a magnanimous $7 billion, barely 1 percent of the DOD’s resources. The Department of Education received an even more generous check of $46.7 billion, a titillating 7 percent.
And the amount needed to financially support the Red Cross’ global humanitarian aid network and other programs? $1.2 billion, a paltry 0.18 percent.
Apathy and misplaced priorities will lead to humanitarian tragedies.
This is why 5.6 million children die from malnutrition every year.
This is why, in just 365 days, millions of people died from preventable infectious diseases.
This is why 5 percent of us use 23 percent of the world’s energy, 13 percent lack clean drinking water, 38 percent do not have the privilege of even basic sanitation.
This is why we, as students, at a university and as a community of scholars, can change what we saw in 2010.
The common stereotype that many USC students come from more affluent backgrounds and live more privileged lives is not exactly false. While reviewing how we spent our 2010, we often forget how others might have spent theirs.
So consider offering more time and skills to altruism. USC offers a plethora of volunteer opportunities, student organizations dedicated to human rights, Greek philanthropies and foundations committed to improving our current living situation.

USC’s international population, the largest of any university in the United States, has given the school a unique opportunity — the chance to save a life.
Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches, a branch of National Marrow Donor Program, is launching an on-campus drive Thursday to find a potentially life-saving match for Sonia Rai, a 24-year-old Los Angeles native and current Boston resident who was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia during the holiday season. The four-hour drive will be held on Trousdale Parkway starting at 10 a.m.
Kanika Jain, a first-year graduate student at USC and one of the drive’s organizers, said Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches chose USC because of the university’s large number of international and South Asian students.
According to The New York Times, USC had 7,987 international students last year, more than any other university in the United States.
“I said to myself ‘Hey, I work and study at USC and there are South Asians everywhere; let’s do a drive here,’” said Elizabeth Jordan, a USC graduate student and a career counselor in the Career Planning & Placement Center.
Jordan said she was moved by Rai’s story and contacted Rai’s brother in Boston to help organize a drive at USC. Jordan previously organized bone marrow drives in 2009 and 2010, both of which produced life-saving matches.
“I truly believe we will find a match for Sonia and she’s going to be okay,” Jordan said. “We’ve got too much inspiration and momentum to fail.”
The drive will ask USC students to sign up for the Be the Match Registry, a commitment to donate blood marrow to a person in need. More than eight million people have already signed up for the registry.
“It is a great idea to have the drive at USC,” said Esther Lee, associate director of the Office of International Services. “USC stands out above the rest because of its international students and a lot of the students come here to get a great education, but here is a rare opportunity to save a life.”
Jordan said it will take approximately 10 minutes for students to register and take a DNA test. She also encourages students who cannot attend the drive in person to sign up at BeTheMatch.org to learn more about the process of bone marrow transplants.
“It’s so fast and easy; just one form and four cheek swabs and you’re done,” Jordan said.
According to a 2007 report by CBS Boston, 1.8 percent of the registry’s eight million members are South Asian.
“There are so many South Asians at USC but so few in the Be the Match Registry,” Jain said. “Sonia needs more South Asians in the registry to find a match.”
Although Rai is searching for a South Asian donor, the organizers of the event encourage all USC students to join the Be the Match Registry.
“Our mission is not just to cure Sonia but to help find donors for other patients in dire need,” said Kamini Rai Cormier, Rai’s cousin.
Rai’s supporters launched the Cure Sonia Campaign via social media and networking, and have held more than 100 drives across the country during the course of a month. Events have been held in Philadelphia, Chicago, Austin, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

As fraternities on The Row kick off their Welcome Back Nights events tonight, steps will be taken to ensure that participating houses follow guidelines to avoid a shutdown by the Department of Public Safety.
Red cups · The Interfraternity Council has created risk management teams to help monitor Welcome Back Nights on Wed. and Thurs. -  Photo Illustration by Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
New Interfraternity Council President Pat Lauer said one of his key focuses this semester is improving the risk management teams, which include members from each fraternity that are trained by DPS on how to control parties and what to do when certain potentially dangerous situations arise.
The risk management program came as a response to the social ban placed on The Row last semester. The goals of the program revolve around the need for better cohesion between Greek members, USC students and authorities.
“In the past, a huge problem has been transparency; there was no communication between DPS and the risk management teams,” Lauer said. “We have to show a legitimacy in our ability to self-govern, and I see bettering the risk management program as the way to go about achieving this.”
Lauer said IFC will again employ measures that were implemented in the fall, after Welcome Back Nights was shut down in spring 2010.
“The problems were the size [of the events] and unwelcomed guests,” Lauer said. “Last semester was our first time using a security company, and we had no incidents, so we decided to do the same thing again [this semester].”
Security will be checking student IDs at the doors and making sure there is no congestion in the street. Music volume is to be kept at a minimum and if students are holding red cups outside of any fraternity, The Row risks being shut down, Lauer said.
The risk management teams will also be doing walks around The Row along with DPS officials to ensure there is compliance with the rules.
As in past semesters, hard alcohol will still be banned and the events will be limited to active fraternity members and USC guests that are invited, which will be left up to each house’s discretion.
“The biggest thing for us is controlling Wednesday night,” Lauer said. “I’ve met with [DPS] Chief Thomas and he said they will probably shut down the whole Row on the second night if Wednesday goes poorly.”
Lauer said the primary goal of the enforcement is to start off the semester on a good note, avoid social related incidents and keep everyone safe.
“It is up to us to control these events so they can trust us to have [them] in the future,” he said.
From an non-Greek perspective, I much preferred The Row when it would often spill out into the street uncontrollably as in 2007. This newer, more confined Greek system resembles a country club with bad taste in fashion and music.

After years of discussion, the university has finally begun construction for the new John McKay Center, which will replace the Intramural Field and provide extra space for coaches and student athletes.
Cleared · The site of the new McKay Athletic Center, formerly the Intramural Field. The site’s groundbreaking ceremony will be held on Wednesday at 11 a.m. The building is scheduled to be completed in time for the 2012 football season. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
Groundbreaking is set to take place Jan. 12 at 11 a.m. on the Intramural Field. The groundbreaking ceremony will include remarks made by President C. L. Max Nikias, Athletic Director Pat Haden and USC Trustee Ronald Tutor.
The new center, named after former USC and Tampa Bay football coach John McKay, began site clearing Nov. 17, finishing Jan. 8. The 110,000-square-foot building, announced last October to be a supplement to Heritage Hall, will include coaches’ offices, meeting rooms, an outdoor patio, a student-athlete lounge and a 32,000-square-foot weight room. Construction is set to officially begin on Jan. 31 and will continue for 18 months.
Although the heavy rain in Los Angeles during December and January affected site clearing and demolition of the field, Haden said he does not expect the start and end dates of the project to be impacted.
Joe Back, associate senior vice president for campus development and the administrator overseeing the project, said the overall plan for construction will begin with an excavation for the basement followed by construction of the basement and the two aboveground floors.
“The entire building and site are intended to be constructed as one project, without phasing,” Back said.
Because the new center will be built in place of the Intramural Field, intramural sports will share McAlister Field with other sports until a new one is built. Other fields, such as Cromwell and Brian Kennedy, will also be shared.
In addition, the Music Practice and Instructional Center, which has already been vacated, will be demolished to make room for a new intramural field between the new John McKay Center and the Loker Track Stadium.
Back acknowledged that there would be minor consequences because of the construction.
Delays and inconveniences will include a closed sidewalk on the east side of McClintock Avenue, near the site, from early February through the end of April, as well as some rescheduling for those sports sharing the McAlister Field until a new intramural field is built.
Although the center will be utilized for all 21 sports teams, it will be the main hub for the football team.
“The new building should be ready to open for football season 2012,” Back said.
Well written and informative!
This is one the best article’s I have ever read, especially by a first-year student!!
