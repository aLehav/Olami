Former USC head football coach Steve Sarkisian is joining Alabama’s coaching staff as an offensive analyst, Alabama coach Nick Saban confirmed on Monday.
Sarkisian was infamously fired at USC weeks into the 2015 season following a series of alcohol-related issues that began with a rant at the annual Salute to Troy event, where he appeared to be intoxicated. Then-Athletic Director Pat Haden gave him the axe in October after he showed up to a practice in poor condition.
The 42-year-old was slated to join Fox Sports as a television analyst this season, but instead will take a job with the Crimson Tide.
“We’re glad to have him as part of the organization,” Saban said to the media. “Hopefully he’ll be able to get back on his feet professionally and this will be beneficial to him.”
Sarkisian will work with Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin, who was also fired from USC in less-then-amicable fashion. Both Sarkisian and Kiffin also coached under Pete Carroll with the Trojans.
Due to NCAA rules on staff size, Sarkisian will not be able to coach players on the field. He is the fifth former head coach to join Alabama’s coaching staff.
Saban said that he and Sarkisian had discussed the role “quite a while ago.”
“He’s going through some personal things himself to get himself in a very positive position and wants to continue to do those things in the future and professionally,” Saban said. “He loves coaching. I’ve known him for a long time and he’s a very, very good coach.”
Saban added that Sarkisian is aware of ramifications should concerns flare up again.
“I think he understands the consequences that he deals with professionally if he has any issues or problems,” Saban said.
Sarkisian is still in the midst of a legal battle with USC. He filed a wrongful terminal lawsuit against the University last December, claiming the school should have allowed him to seek treatment for alcoholism rather than dismissing him. The case is headed for arbitration; Sarkisian is seeking the $12.6 million remaining on his contract in addition to unspecified damages.
Sark after Dark ll
The saga continues 
Why do we care? He already moved on from SC.
Drink on!
Sabin must have offered to pay Sark’s bar bill.

I’m just going to come right out and say it – the formidable #CollegeBudget is realer than your Freshman Fifteen struggles in EVK and Cafe 84. 
It’s true.
But just because that Freshman Fifteen got the better of you doesn’t mean that your money (or lack thereof) has to, too.
For those that don’t know, Whole Foods Market opened up a brand new store here in Downtown LA (788 South Grand Avenue … I don’t have the address memorized, what?), bringing some healthy, organic and fresh apartment options for you, to you!
The problem? Whole Foods has the reputation of being stupidly expensive – and I get it; $7.00 asparagus water is beyond pretentious, no doubt – plus, TJ’s homemade desserts are kind of way too good to turn down, right?
I’m not going to say you have to sacrifice those beloved TJ’s and Ralph’s adventures – please, no – but I am going to reveal to you the widely unknown yet crazily life-changing realization that Whole Foods, too, can be affordable.
Oh, and a bonus tip for you: check out www.instacart.com for same-day home delivery services right here in DTLA. #Winning

School has started and the usual hustle and bustle is putting most of us back to the grind!  It’s easy to manage time by just rushing everything including food. However, I’ve found it especially difficult to cope on days where I skipped breakfast. Thus, I’m going to list out a few breakfast recipes that you can whip up in minutes to ensure that you start your day on a positive note.

I discovered this online and this has become one of my personal favorites. First, you take 1/2 cup of oats and blend them into a fine powder. After that, add in 1 cup of strawberries, 1/4th cup of Greek yogurt, 1 tbsp chia seeds, 1 tbsp honey (adjust according to your taste) and 3/4th cup of any milk of your choice and blend this mixture. You’ll get two glasses with the above measurements; tastiest when consumed within 30 minutes as the Chia seeds start to expand slowly.
Rich in protein, calcium and other healthy nutrients- this quick blend is one of the healthiest among the lot!

Have a little Indian twist, in case you’re craving for a bit of tang and spice early in the day. Go ahead with this and trust me, you will love it! This takes hardly 5-7 min to make. Heat oil in a pan, add mustard seeds and when they start crackling – add in onions and chilies while sautéing this mixture. Add in bell peppers, tomatoes, cut bread pieces, salt, turmeric and garam masala. Season with lemon juice and enjoy! Alternatively, substitute the bread with quinoa.

I haven’t forgotten everyone’s favorite breakfast foods: egg and avocado. Dedicated to you all, this recipe is the easiest on the list. Toast some whole wheat bread, smash some avocado and apply on the slices. Layer sunny-side up eggs and munch away. You could also cook the egg well and make a sandwich out of it!

If you have absolutely no time in the morning, this is one of the best options for you! Boost your day with chia seeds instead of caffeine. Very basic ingredients for this – take a small glass or jar and add equal amounts of oats, Greek yogurt, and any milk of your choice. Get creative with toppings by adding fruit, dark chocolate, peanut butter and jam, or simply lacing with honey and refrigerate at night. In the morning, you can just grab and go!
