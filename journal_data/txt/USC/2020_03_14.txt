Undergraduate Student Government is calling on USC to continue to support vulnerable communities who are disadvantaged by the closure of campus amenities and period of online instruction due to coronavirus. In a press release shared Saturday on Instagram, USG said it hopes the University will offer additional resources to the student body should more restrictive measures be required.
“The University has to take very drastic steps to be able to protect the health and safety of the whole community right now,” said USG President Trenton Stone in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “What we’re trying to do is reaffirm that there’s other implications that we also have to consider through all of these decisions.”
Cosponsored by Trojan Shelter and cosigned by several political, cultural and advocacy assemblies, including International Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly, Student Assembly for Accessibility and College Democrats at USC, the press release asks the University for sustained support of low-income students, students with disabilities, international students and students facing housing insecurity.
“With 20% of the student body eligible for Pell grants and over 11,000 total international students on campus, we fear that a sizable number of our classmates will be stripped of the means to meet their basic needs, most crucially housing and food, in light of travel restrictions, work interruptions, and quarantines,” the statement read.
Matthew Lee, the director of media at Trojan Shelter and main author of the press release, said although he believes USC has accommodated students at risk, he and his coworkers were still uncertain about the way the University’s future decisions would impact the community.
“I got a lot of concerns from students, people on our team just saying that they’re really, really worried that USC would take measures similar to what we’ve seen with Smith University and Harvard University, when they just kind of kicked out all their students unanimously,” Lee said. “Though USC has really been really good about making sure that these things have been taken care of … I think a lot of us were still concerned that we were still at will or under the authority and power of the University.”
In light of the evolving nature of the coronavirus pandemic, USG said it hopes the University will maintain its commitment to marginalized students in the event of a campus shutdown by providing housing vouchers or rooms at the USC Hotel, granting emergency aid, keeping the Trojan Food Pantry open, relaunching the virtual food pantry and making internet connection accessible. 
“We recognize that USC proactively works on many of the issues identified above, but we hope that codifying and institutionally developing and promoting them can provide some peace of mind to students in the interim, and crucial resources to them, especially if the situation worsens,” the statement read.

A petition is circulating calling USC to reimburse partial tuition following the transition of in-class lectures to an online format. The petition, created Thursday night, claims that refunds are merited because the University has not acted appropriately in response to the potential spread of coronavirus on campus. More than 3,100 people have signed the petition.
Since the release of this petition, the University has not addressed reimbursements for tuition. However, Provost Charles Zukoski announced Friday that students who refrain from returning to student housing through mid-April when remote instruction ends will be able to receive partial refunds or credits for housing and dining, though no specific reimbursement plan has been outlined.  
All undergraduate classes and most graduate classes have transitioned online and will be conducted digitally until April 14. This period of remote instruction has been extended by two weeks since it was first announced and may be extended further as the situation develops. 
While recognizing the University’s position in making these decisions, the petition contends that participating in classes remotely and through digital platforms, such as Zoom, marks a decrease in the quality of education assured by USC’s more than $57,000 tuition. 
“While we recognize and sympathize with the difficult position that the Coronavirus has put University of Southern California in, this transition to online classes represents a notable reduction in educational and instructional quality, which we fear will negatively affect our educational and professional outcomes moving forward,” the petition read.
The petition also asserted the cancellation of talks, networking events and reduction of personal time with professors would have an impact on professional career prospects. All University-related events, including Springfest, campus tours and athletic games have been canceled through at least mid-April. 
“The cost of online classes is much cheaper than [in-person] classes, and the opportunity to talk to the professor face to face, the [campus talks] and the activities that the school holds [does] not exist [anymore],” said petition creator Bianca Sun, a graduate student studying law. “That’s a part that we should be reimbursed.” 
The cancellation of USC programs has also caused apprehension among graduating students as they finish school amid a volatile financial market. The Dow Jones industrial average fell to its lowest point in about 30 years Thursday, after the New York Federal Reserve intervened with a $1.5 trillion injection. The 10% drop marked the worst day since the 1987 stock market crash.
“This is a particularly worrying prospect for those of us graduating in 2020, as we will likely find ourselves graduating into a recession,” the petition read.
The University is still planning on going through with commencement in May; however, in a memo to the USC community, Zukoski said that is subject to change depending on developments.
