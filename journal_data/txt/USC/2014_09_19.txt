Oliver Franke, a senior lecturer in aerospace and mechanical engineering died Thursday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of a heart attack. He was 35 years old.
“Oliver contributed greatly to our teaching mission,” wrote Viterbi School of Engineering Dean Yannis C. Yortsos in a memorandum sent to Viterbi faculty and staff on Thursday. “He was an outstanding instructor.”
Franke had received an engineering diploma and a doctorate from the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg in 2005 and 2009 respectively. Franke was with the Department of Material Sciences and Engineering at MIT until he joined the USC faculty in 2010 as a visiting assistant professor.
Franke, who was named a senior lecturer in Fall 2012, was married to Viterbi aerospace and material science professor, Andrea Hodge.
“This has hit all of us very hard because [Oliver and Andrea] are very likeable people, and so it’s a significant loss for not only us but for [Andrea] as well,” Yortsos told the Daily Trojan.
Students in Franke’s classes remember him for his enthusiasm and eagerness to teach.  Kevin Chan, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering was in two of Franke’s classes.
“He encouraged our participation and even went as far as to give us chocolate for our efforts,” Chan said. “He reminded me that teaching and learning is more so a dialogue than a speech.”
Viterbi will hold a memorial service for Franke at the Caruso Catholic Center next week. The time and date are to be announced. Franke is survived by his wife Andrea Hodge.
“It’s very sad to have one of your colleagues pass away particularly at a young age,” Yortsos said. “His family and wife are in our thoughts and prayers.”
