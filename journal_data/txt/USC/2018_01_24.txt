A horrific case of deja-vu gripped the USC men’s basketball team in its Wednesday night contest with Stanford at the Galen Center Wednesday night. When the Trojans played the Cardinal back on Jan. 7 in Palo Alto, USC’s demise was a 55-foot, 3-pointer from Stanford freshman guard Daejon Davis that swooshed through the rim as time in regulation expired. Wednesday night’s contest between the two teams was all-too-familiar for USC’s comfort.

Davis hit a pair of free throws with 32 seconds remaining in regulation to pull Stanford within a 66-64 deficit of the Trojans. And after senior guard Jordan McLaughlin missed a pair of free throws with seconds remaining, the stage was set again for Davis to break the Trojans’ hearts; Stanford trailed 67-64 with under 15 seconds remaining. 
Luckily for USC, history did not repeat itself and Davis missed the possible game-winning 3-pointer. Davis’ miss was followed by a dunk from USC senior guard Elijah Stewart as time expired and the Trojans came away with a thrilling 69-64 revenge-victory over the Cardinal at home. 
“Personally, when [Davis] shot the ball I didn’t want to look to see if he was going make it,” said USC sophomore guard Jonah Mathews, who finished with a game-high 18 points. “I just looked at our bench … I saw they started celebrating, and then I definitely knew he didn’t make it.”
The win over Stanford (11-10, 5-3 in Pac-12) Wednesday was USC’s fifth consecutive conference victory. The Trojans’ current five-game winning streak is their longest of the season. 
And as of Wednesday night, USC (15-6, 7-2) moved into a tie for first-place in the Pac-12 conference standings with Arizona. The Wildcats (16-4, 6-1) will play Colorado on Thursday night in a contest that could determine the current outright leader in the Pac-12 standings. 
“Any time we go on a nice little winning streak we want to keep it going. Our confidence is through the roof right now,” said USC sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic. “We’re all focused. We all have the same goal.” 
In the first half against Stanford, USC’s offense hit 18-of-31 shots (58.1 percent) from the floor. The Trojans’ hot-shooting to open up the game gave them a 41-26 lead at the half. A dunk from Rakocevic to open up the second-half gave the Trojans their largest lead of the night, putting USC ahead 43-26 with 19:29 remaining in regulation. 
But USC’s 17-point lead would go on to evaporate in the later stages of the game. A 12-for-34 shooting performance (35.3 percent) in the second half reflected the Trojans’ offensive struggles late against Stanford. 
The Cardinal responded to USC’s sluggish second half by shooting 12-for-22 (54.5 percent) from the field in the final period of play. Stanford’s comeback was built on an effort that saw them shoot 10-for-10 from the free throw line in the second half. USC shot 4-for-8 from the charity stripe for the entire game. 
“It wasn’t [Stanford’s] defense. Team’s just go through those stretches (of struggling to score) … We just had to play through it and come away with the win,” said Mathews. 
The Trojans were without junior forward Bennie Boatwright (averaging 15.1 PPG this season) against Stanford, as he is dealing with what is reported to be a plantar wart that has caused him foot soreness. Starting in Boatwright’s place was Rakocevic, who finished Wednesday with nine points and eight rebounds, on 4-of-8 shooting from the field.
“[Rakocevic’s] a good player for us defensively. He brings it for us, and he played well tonight,” said USC head coach Andy Enfield. 
Mathews hit a game-high 4-of-6 3-pointers against the Cardinal. The final 3-point field goal of the night for Mathews was a crucial one, as it helped USC reclaim a double-digit lead with just over five minutes remaining in regulation, 64-54. 
“Our league is extremely deep and tough. We don’t ever take a win for granted,” Enfield said. “We have to keep getting better … focusing just on the task at hand, which is our next game.” 
Mathews was one of three Trojans to score in double-figures on Wednesday. Junior forward Chimezie Metu recorded a double-double with his 12-point (5-of-11 FG), 10-rebound effort.  Senior guard Elijah Stewart shot 5-of-10 from the field and finished with 10 points. 
In what was a rough shooting outing for McLaughlin (3-for-11 FG), the senior captain recorded a game-high nine assists. McLaughlin entered Wednesday’s contest leading the conference in assists (averaging 7.5 APG). 
Metu was at the center of what was an impressive offensive-effort for USC down low. The Trojans outscored Stanford in the paint, 48-28. 
USC will look to continue its strong momentum in conference play this weekend. The Trojans will be aim to extend their current Pac-12 winning-streak to six games when they host Cal at the Galen Center this Sunday. 
Something amiss with this team vs. Stanford. Had a 17 pt. lead at the start of 2nd half down to a 2 pt. margin
at the end. Enfield gets out coached in the 2nd half now twice blowing big leads. Team  seems to play not to
lose once big lead established.

This weekend, the women’s basketball team will head north to Washington to take on the Huskies and the Cougars. Coming off two losses to Stanford and Cal, the Women of Troy look to score a couple wins against a pair of struggling Washington teams. Washington State sits at 9-11 including a 2-6 Pac-12 conference record while Washington stands at 7-12, with  a 1-7 conference record. With two losses against Cal and Stanford, the Women of Troy are now 13-6 with a 3-5 conference record.

On Friday, Washington State will host USC after losing to crosstown rival Washington last weekend. Redshirt sophomore forward Borislava Hristova leads Washington State as she is the focal point of the offense and a very capable scoring machine. She averages 18.6 points to go along with 4.3 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 1.3 steals; she is very versatile on the offensive end, able to shoot from deep (33 percent from 3-point land) and finds ways to get herself to the free throw line — where she averages 3.3 attempts from the line and connects on 73 percent of her tries. However, the team lacks depth to support their scoring machine — though sophomore guard Chanelle Molina has emerged as a capable scoring option in recent games for the Cougars. 
“We’re probably going to put one of our best defensive players on [Borislava Hristova] and deny her touches, maybe limit her shots and just get up into her and make her put the ball on the floor,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “It’s going to be a tough matchup because she’s a really good player but we’re very conscious of what she can do and we’ve schemed to try and take her out of the game.” 
On Sunday, USC will play Washington. After their matchup against Washington State, sophomore guard Amber Melgoza leads the Huskies with 17.1 points per game. Sophomore forward Mai-Loni Henson and senior guard Jenna Moser are also offensive threats. Henson averages 9.9 points while Moser is a sharpshooting guard who, despite averaging a modest 9.6 points, is shooting 41.8 percent from 3-point range and compiles 2.1 steals and 2.8 assists per game. Washington is also a great offensive rebounding team, an area that hampered USC in its losses against Cal and Stanford. Washington not only faces problems with depth but also faces problems with inefficient scoring as the team collectively shoots 38.7 percent from the field per game, including 31 percent from deep. 
“We’ve been outrebounded but we haven’t been outrebounded by that much,” Trakh said. “We don’t start a kid over six foot so that’s part of our problem but I think the kids have a lot of heart. Rebounding is all heart, that’s nothing to do with size. I think we just got to box out because Washington plays hard and they rebound so we’re going to have to box out, we’re going to have to go to the rim, fly at the ball. I think we’re going to be okay in that respect. We know how they play and we’ve got to box out and fly at the ball.” 
Despite tough losses against Cal and Stanford, USC is hoping to get back on track in a prime opportunity to take two wins against struggling Washington teams. Rebounding will be key as both Washington teams are more than capable of crashing the offensive glass, something USC has struggled to contest in their games against Stanford and Cal. Controlling the rebounds to limit opponents’ second chance opportunities could well be the deciding factor. The defense will also have to key in on their lead scorers, especially Washington State’s redshirt sophomore forward Borislava Hristova, as they are capable of scoring in bunches.
“Main factors is just good defense, taking good shots on offense, playing together basically,” sophomore guard Minyon Moore said. “We have to get these two wins in a row and I think if we just do our roles, play good defense and execute on offense, we’ll win these two games.” 
Trakh discussed the Trojans’ biggest battle for each opponent.
“Against Washington State is if we can attack their matchup zone and against Washington it’s going to be handling their full court pressure, they’re going to play ten people equally and our bench is not very deep as far as bringing guards ins,” Trakh said. “So against Washington State, it’s attacking their matchup zone, defending their sets. Against Washington, it’s about handling their pressure; they’ll substitute 10 people and press for 40 minutes so it’s how well we handle that and getting good shots against both teams.” 
The starters have played very well in recent games. Junior guard Aliyah Mazyck has played well on both offense and defense in recent games as she has helped USC space the offense with her shooting and has disrupted teams on the defensive end. Senior forward Kristen Simon has also been a consistent presence in the low block and was key in fouling out junior forward Kristine Anigwe when USC played Cal. Moore compiled one of her best games to date, with 19 points, five rebounds, one assist, two blocks and three steals against Cal. 
Graduate student guard Jordan Adams and senior guard Sadie Edwards both contributed in the match with Adams recording a total of 15 rebounds over their last two games and Edwards providing a defensive wing presence by compiling four blocks and three steals in the past two games. USC will continue to rely on their stellar performance against Washington and Washington State. 
“Basically we have the same five we had last year, we have the same core as we had last year so I think that chemistry and just having experience playing on the court together,” Moore said. “We’ve gotten to know our tendencies and whatnot so it’s been really easy to play with the other four girls because everyone just plays their role and we do really good together.”
The Trojans play the Cougars on Friday at 7 p.m. and the Huskies on Sunday at 2 p.m. Pac-12 Network will not be showing the games, but the games can be watched from Washington and Washington State’s own live streams.

The most important story in sports this week did not happen on a football field or a basketball court … or on any playing surface. Instead, it happened in a courtroom in Lansing, Mich., where more than 150 girls and women spoke directly to Larry Nassar — a former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor who pleaded guilty to several sex crimes — during his sentencing hearing, which concluded Wednesday with Nassar sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison.
There are several storylines here, the most important of which is the very fact that this is happening, that these survivors — who include prominent American gymnasts such as three-time Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman — feel empowered to speak up, to confront this monster who exploited and abused them and manipulated their trust for so many years, while institutions such as USA Gymnastics and Michigan State ignored repeated complaints. Make no mistake: This should be the headline on every sports website right now — not Tom Brady, not LaVar Ball.
This story is as uplifting as it is horrifying and infuriating. For every brave woman who has stood before Nassar in court and described how much he ruined their lives and despite how he’ll spend the rest of his life rotting in jail, disrespect and insensitivity persist. Michigan State trustee Joel Ferguson said during a radio interview, “There’s so many more things going on at the university than just this Nassar thing.” 
For every supportive statement offered by Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, who allowed time for every single one of Nassar’s victims who wish to speak to come forward at the hearing, there’s the fact that Michigan State President Lou Anna Simon took until Wednesday to resign, despite the Detroit News reporting that 14 university representatives were made aware of Nassar’s abuse — and stood silent. Even then, she offered a tone deaf resignation letter, which she opened by literally inserting herself into the same sentence as Nassar’s victims and ended it by calling this tragedy politicized, that she would take the resulting blame. 
“As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger,” Simon wrote. “I understand, and that is why I have limited my personal statements.”
No, clearly, you don’t understand. Why is it so hard to just apologize, admit fault, resign and leave it at that?
And for every such half-hearted apology that these enablers issue, there is the ridiculous comment made by NCAA President Mark Emmert last week, when he claimed that he did not have enough details to voice an opinion on the matter. Yes, you heard that right. More than a hundred survivors have come forward to speak directly to Nassar about the trauma he induced in their lives, creating a story that has been in the news cycle for days on end — Nassar himself has literally pleaded guilty to the charges — and the head of the organization that is supposed to ensure the health, safety and well-being of its student-athletes claim he does not have enough details to voice an opinion on the matter. 
But do the smallest thing to attack the “amateurism” of student-athletes, and come hell or high water, you bet Emmert will strongly condemn it. Amazing, yet pathetic — as the NCAA typically is.
The NCAA can do better, and it has a chance to atone for the nonsense that came out of Emmert’s mouth. On Tuesday night, it announced an investigation into Michigan State’s handling of the Nassar case. Nassar worked at Michigan State from 1997 to 2016, during which he was accused of sexual abuse by cross country and softball players that he treated. The NCAA will investigate the school for any potential rule violations, and hopefully it will get to the bottom of whatever cover-up may have happened and how high it went — and punish the university accordingly.
And yet, to put your trust in the NCAA is like trusting a 2-year-old to have proper morals. This the same organization that went light on Penn State after assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky molested young boys, backing off on what had originally been decently tough sanctions. This is the same organization that has yet to punish Baylor University, where football player after football player was accused of sexual assault in recent years, creating one of the worst national scandals we’ve ever seen. 
The many victims and survivors of Nassar’s horrific actions will never receive enough justice, but giving them a chance to look this monster in the eye and know that he’ll die in a prison cell is a step in the right direction. And if Michigan State did indeed cover up the crimes, the NCAA must come down hard and make sure there no more Larry Nassars. 
Mr. Emmert, this story will go in your hands next. Don’t bow down to terrible people like the aforementioned Ferguson, who had more disgusting things to say, this time about whether the NCAA would investigate the school.
“This is not Penn State,” Ferguson said. “They were dealing with their football program. They’re smart enough to know they’re not competent to walk in here on this.”
I’m begging the NCAA: Be competent. For once, be on the right side of history. Do your job. Help these survivors heal.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted 12-0 Tuesday in favor of the resolution to implement free menstrual products in gender-neutral and women’s restrooms across both the University Park and the Health Science Campuses. 
The USG Senate unanimously passed the free menstrual product resolution during Tuesday night’s meeting and voted on the additional staffers for the upcoming USG elections next month. Catherine Liang | Daily Trojan.
The final draft of the resolution was authored by USG Director of Community and External Affairs Mai Mizuno, Senator Debbie Lee and Director of Wellness Affairs Marina Hrovat.
Hrovat spoke on the addition of the Health Science Campus to the resolution, which was previously not in the initial draft proposed at the Jan. 16 meeting. 
“We felt like if these products are being provided on this campus, there is no reason they shouldn’t be provided on the Health Science Campus,” Hrovat said.
The final draft of the resolution also included a statistic regarding the mental health effects of menstruation. Mizuno, who launched this initiative last spring, noted this as justification for the resolution’s passage.
“Eighty six percent of menstruating individuals start their period unexpectedly in public without the supplies they need,” Mizuno said. “This does disrupt students and how they go about their everyday lives on campus.”
With the resolution’s passing, discussion has shifted from the formation of the resolution to its implementation. According to Mizuno, Hrovat is currently in charge of finalizing a vendor to supply the menstrual products.
“Marina will look at what is the best option for us, from a budget perspective and from a quality perspective,” Mizuno said. “We want to provide students with the best possible menstrual products.”
Mizuno said that granting access to free menstrual products in restrooms is not only a women’s issue, modifying the language of the proposal to promote inclusivity.
“I really emphasized, in the language, ‘menstruating individuals,’” Mizuno said. “It’s not just women that menstruate but folks that identify as male or non-binary that can also really benefit from this initiative.”
Mizuno stressed the longevity of this initiative — which has been in the works since last spring — and the unsung people who were instrumental in the progression of this initiative since last spring.
“Previous students, senators and senate aides should be acknowledged,” Mizuno said. “It is really the work that multiple people had put in prior to its introduction in the senate. Most advocacy initiatives usually take years.”
The USG senate suspended Robert’s rules the second time this semester, allowing it to deviate from standard parliamentary procedures. The Senate used this suspension in order to push a vote up by one week. The Senate unanimously approved of three additional interns and 14 commissioners to staff the upcoming USG elections.

Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Ose claims USC disinvited him from the gubernatorial candidate town hall that was held in Bovard Auditorium on Jan. 13.
Six candidates debated an array of issues including homelessness, immigration, single-payer health care and the prison system. Ling Luo | Daily Trojan.
According to the former California representative, he had initially been invited to the candidate forum when he spoke on the phone with community engagement director Meghan Ginley from the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics on Jan. 5.
He said the disinvitation was “unworthy of the institution of USC’s history of tradition.”
Ginley said that there had been no intention of presenting him with an invitation to the town hall when they spoke, and they had only discussed the event’s details and qualifying factors for a candidate to be invited to the event.
“We did not extend him the invitation,” she said. “We were collecting data, we were collecting information [about his candidacy].”
Additionally, Ginley said she did not have the authority to invite him to the forum. The decision to not extend an invitation to Ose was that of her partners, including those from the Unruh Institute of Politics, the Empowerment Congress and media sponsors.
In response to Ose’s claims, USC said in a statement to the Daily Trojan, “The Gubernatorial Town Hall held at USC on Saturday Jan. 13, includes six candidates who met the objective, established criteria.”
The disqualifying factor for Ose was the Jan. 8 cutoff date. Though he had filed papers the morning he spoke to Ginley, Ose had not made a formal announcement about his candidacy before that date, Ginley said.
Those planning the event expected formal announcements from potential candidates to ensure that they were running because in the past, people have launched open exploratory campaigns, she said.
Ose did, however, meet other criteria, which stated that he either had to have previously served in a position of government or had to have raised $100,000 for his campaign. Six other candidates along with Ose were also excluded from the event for not meeting the aforementioned criteria, Ginley said.
Ose said he had been under the impression that Ginley intended to invite him to the candidate forum after speaking with friends from the Sacramento Bee and the Los Angeles Times.
Ose expressed frustration with the cutoff date, saying three days was enough time to make and finalize accommodations. However, Ginley said that adding him to the town hall past the date would affect set up for the event as well as technological aspects of it.
“Frankly, it would have been nice to have another person in the debate, but he didn’t meet the criterion,” said director of the Unruh Institute of Politics Bob Shrum, who was involved in putting together the candidate forum. “It wouldn’t’ve been fair to the other candidates. We had set a cutoff of Jan. 8 and we held to it.”
Another gubernatorial town hall will take place at USC in late March, hosted by the USC Price School of Public Policy. This is a potential opportunity for Ose to expand on his campaign, Ginley said.

The mission of the U.S. Air Force is to fly, fight and win in air, space and cyberspace. Out of 280 proposals from researchers nationwide, two USC Viterbi School of Engineering professors received $450,000 grants from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research to aid the force’s mission through their investigative studies.

The grants, titled the Air Force Young Investigator Award, encourages creative research in science and engineering, which the professors will utilize to continue their studies and provide more opportunities to students.
“Winning awards is one thing, but I think the major goal for researchers is to publish high-impact papers,” assistant professor Qiming Wang said. 
Through his research, Wang’s students are able to explore the mechanics of physical materials, specifically how soft surfaces like rubber, human skin and muscle can be deformed. 
Assistant professor Mahdi Soltanolkotabi focuses on the intersection of data science, statistics and computer science through the creation of algorithms in machine learning.
“There are a lot of problems in engineering and basic sciences,” Soltanolkotabi said. “At the end of the day you want to optimize something. You want to maximize revenue, you want to minimize signal error.”
Wang’s research involves studying self-healing structures and how they are manufactured. He imagines that, through his work, fractured aircraft wings, bullet-damaged armor and broken cell phone circuits will be able repair themselves. 
Wang creates smaller, durable yet lightweight models, such as cubes, capable of self-repair through 3-D printing. After these structures break, they mend themselves within hours almost to their original form, Wang said.
“We don’t need to spend extra money for [an aircraft wing],” Wang said. “If we have some material that can be made into [armor] and also can automatically, autonomously self-heal, then you can reuse it…”
These structures are made of a polymer-type material that Wang already developed in his prior research. When Wang first designed the material, he was able to infuse self-healable and photocurable properties into the polymer. However, mastering the coexistence of these two characteristics in the material’s design was a challenge. 
“These two requirements compete with each other,” Wang said. “We have to find an adequate molecular structure to enable both behaviors.”
Although his current research is on a smaller-scale, Wang wishes to transition into large-scale printing and further expand on his studies in the future.
“We already have the material, [so] once we receive the grant … we can begin to do this 3-D printing of this kind of structure and test how this can help the repairing of the structures,” Wang said.
Soltanolkatobi’s research focuses primarily on learning data representations, which is the process of mapping or embedding data into representations that enable the computer to interpret high-dimensional data.  
These algorithms have many uses in modern signal processing and machine learning, applicable to artificial intelligence usage. For instance, they can solve word analogies, Soltanolkotabi said.  
According to Soltanolkotabi, optimization problems are commonly encountered in engineering and sciences, but for his current research, he decided to look at more unconventional problems. 
These problems have the potential for larger impact in signal processing and computational imaging. They will additionally decrease frequent purchases of expensive scientific equipment, as the computer will be able to augment many measurement devices. 
“These algorithms can help overcome the deficiencies in many devices,” Soltanolkotabi said. “You can buy a cheap, small telescope but get the same image quality of a much larger more expensive one.”
Soltanolkotabi hopes that his research will reduce error and uncertainty surrounding modern artificial intelligence algorithms. Many of these algorithms fail because we do not have the technology required to further understand them, he said.
“These heuristics are like a black box and we don’t really understand why or how they work,” Soltanolkotabi said. “This lack of understanding could cause some issues and there are a variety of ethical concerns, fairness concerns … My hope is that by understanding the underlying theory behind why or how these algorithms work, I can make these inferential algorithms more reliable and fair.”

Shauli Bar-On | Daily Trojan
This past weekend, over 4 million people worldwide took to the streets in demonstration for the annual Women’s March. The first women’s march took place last January after President Donald Trump’s first day in office. The 2018 march was propelled in great part due to the #MeToo movement, which raises awareness about sexual assault and drives the fight to end it. 
Sexual assault, specifically as it pertains to college campuses, is not a new issue. In 2014, California became the first state to issue an “affirmative consent” or “yes means yes” standard to protect victims of abuse and sexual assault. The new standard now dictates that any sexual action should be considered unwilling unless an affirmative “yes” is given by both parties. Previously, parties could imply consent and unwanted advances would only be identified when one party would say “no.” At the time, the new standard was a novel approach to tackle a serious issue. But a few years down the road, it became clear we did not know exactly what we were signing up for. 
Before we can go on to critique the “yes means yes” standard, it is necessary to identify the root of the problem: It is an impossible standard to implement given current norms. The USC Code of Student Misconduct, drafted analogous to the California legislature’s, defines consent as a “positive cooperation in act and attitude made with knowledge and agreement to the nature of the act.” This is a vague description of what it takes for one party to agree to intimacy. 
Does consent have to be verbal, or can it just be implied? What about mere “positive cooperation?” 
Due to the rule’s ambiguity, it becomes almost impossible to put it into practice. In a case of alleged sexual assault, does the burden to prove consent fall on the alleged assaulter, or does the burden fall on the complaining party to prove that no consent was actually given? 
Art by Di Wu | Daily Trojan
To further complicate the matter, the USC code also dictates that “lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent.” Does this mean that college students are expected to distinguish between “positive cooperation” and “lack of protest?” Ideally, yes. But there is a dangerous lack of education for students to understand how to identify which is which. If we want the standard to be followed, we need to be educated about identifying consent. 
Believing that a verbal “yes” is given before each and every sexual encounter ignores reality. The USC Code of Student Misconduct stipulates that, “consent cannot be inferred from an existing or previous dating relationship. Previous sexual activity between the parties cannot, by itself, be assumed to be an indicator of consent.” 
This wording poses numerous problems. The USC Code and California standard suggest that without such an affirmative “yes,” each and every time a couple — no matter how long they have been dating — are intimate, they are engaging in sexual misconduct. Therefore, according to this, long-term couples who imply consent without a verbal “yes” each time they are intimate, are committing sexual assault. 
The implication of “yes” becomes a “no” if only one partner takes that position. In other words, this is the old “no means no” standard in action. If we do not uphold the law for one case, how can we uphold it for other cases? Do we uphold the law only when someone complains? Where do we draw the line? 
The “yes means yes” standard functions poorly between first-time partners as well. First-time partners do not seek a “yes” every time they engage in intimacy. According to the law, they should. The next focus needs to be on implementation, on teaching the new generation about this standard. Only by ingraining the idea of affirmative consent into our culture can it be effectively used. 
A change in the statutes means nothing unless it is understood by those who are obligated to follow it. A rewriting of the law does not change a culture — only knowledge and education can do that.
Shauli Bar-On is a freshman majoring in political science. “Point/Counterpoint” runs Wednesdays.
“Do you want to have sex?” “Yes,” it’s that simple. And a couple in a relationship that has sex without this conversation is not automatically participating in sexual assault — assault can happen in relationships, and this rule dictates that a complaint of the sort be taken seriously, not that the parties be automatically convicted. Bar-On I hope you do some research and read these comments.
Hi Shauli,
First of all, thank you for publishing such an article with your true opinions on the issues of sexual assault and consent. Without people like you revealing how they might feel internally about problems that congregate our society today, we may never be able to change public opinion and educate the majority. 
That being said, I will now take the time to explain why your views are problematic and pose a couple of questions that may help both you and me understand what your viewpoint is on all of this. I hope you will be able to consider my response and take it to heart, for this is an important issue for you to understand. 
First off, I will address your point about how the “yes means yes” standard is an “impossible standard to implement given current norms.” You talk about how it is difficult for an average student to identify the difference between “positive cooperation” and “lack of protest,” and how in order for this to happen, students must be educated about identifying consent. 
At this point, I was confused about the rest of your article, since you seem to believe that giving consent, or giving a verbalized “yes”, before every sexual encounter is an idealistic expectation of any given student. However, you state that in order for consent to become a “current norm,” we must focus on educating the public of such. You contradict your own argument. 
What are you asking for? What do you suppose people should be educated on, if not the standard of consent to prevent cases of sexual coercion, molestation, and rape? You say that “a change in the statutes means nothing unless it is understood by those who are obligated to follow it.” Does this not call for education about consent, a so-called idealized concept you believe to only be upheld by the “complainers?”
Thank you Justine, well said!
To add to the discussion, either within a new intimate relationship or an aged one the need for verbal consent is not something that dulls or can be ignored. To have healthy, positive sex verbal consent is necessary. Understanding your partner, ensuring their comfort and them ensuring yours is a terrific and mandatory part of engaging in sex or sexual acts. And it will only increase the connection and pleasure! Furthermore, if our culture is uncomfortable by verbal consent it is upon us as a culture to transform.

Sonali Seth | Daily Trojan
Four years ago, California legislators legalized “affirmative consent” — a clear standard for sexual contact that requires affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement from both parties. But when an anonymous woman called Grace published her account of a murky sexual encounter with actor and self-proclaimed feminist Aziz Ansari, the account was met with a flurry of different responses, ranging from those who disavowed Ansari, to those who resonated with the incident but couldn’t quite put their finger on the violation, to those who decried the controversy entirely. It’s become clear that affirmative consent isn’t a concept familiar to most people. 
Even though affirmative consent may be a legal standard in California, it’s not a cultural one. The responses to this incident show that far from accepting affirmative consent as the prevailing marker, we don’t even understand it. 
This is because when California passed its affirmative consent bill in 2014, universities failed to realize just how radical the idea really was. We plastered “Yes Means Yes” posters on walls, but college students didn’t challenge themselves to actually abide by the new standard. And today, most people simply don’t exercise affirmative consent in their daily lives, creating a point of contention. If we want the #MeToo movement to not only dethrone powerful sexual predators, but also change sexual dynamics between men and women for the better, then we must consider a new framework entirely. And we can’t just preach “yes means yes;” we have to ask that verbal, affirmative consent — not just the absence of a “no” — be used in our personal lives, as well.
If both Ansari and Grace had understood affirmative consent, the situation wouldn’t have unfolded the way it did. So, even if one thinks that it’s too extreme to require a verbal “yes” for sex, it is clear that the practice is both helpful and useful to ensure the comfort of all parties involved. 
Art by Di Wu | Daily Trojan
So here’s a message for the “good guys.” You might have identified with Ansari before Grace’s account was published. You want to respect women in your daily personal life. Maybe you went to the Women’s March this past weekend. And perhaps you also saw yourself as the Ansari portrayed in Grace’s account — you’re not a “mind reader,” as Bari Weiss of The New York Times wrote in Ansari’s defense.
Well, if you use affirmative consent, you don’t have to be a mind reader. Waiting for a “yes” from your partner is clear and unambiguous; it is an extraordinarily helpful way to ensure the constant comfort of your partner. 
Critics say that affirmative consent isn’t reflective of the actual reality of intimacy. But so what? Can’t we change that? Grace’s account of her encounter with Ansari resonated with thousands of women because it was so relatable. So many women have had similar experiences, which they might remember as various degrees of regrettable, uncomfortable, coercive or even tantamount to assault. And having both parties understand and use affirmative consent could have prevented all of that.
We must acknowledge that using this standard is a radical departure from the status quo. Affirmative consent encompasses more than the deceptively simple slogan “yes means yes.” It is an inquiry into a verbal agreement before actions are taken. 
So talk to your partner about affirmative consent. Maybe you’ll decide it isn’t for you, but provide yourself the opportunity for greater communication, which can only lead to better, more well-informed relationships and intimacy.
Yet, the cultural conversation doesn’t end here. The next step is to define at which points affirmative consent might be necessary, and to come to a consensus. 
This will be difficult — if the responses to the Ansari allegations show us anything, it’s that the #MeToo movement is chock full of nuanced and diverse opinions. But think of the benefits: We could harness #MeToo not just to yank sexual predators out of power, but also to seep into all of our individual lives to reconceptualize and improve our relationships. With these difficult conversations, we could forge a better sexual culture on campus and in our lives after college. Enduring an intellectual back-and-forth, for that legacy? I’ll take it.

Does a woman need to ask for a man’s consent if she’s initiating sex?
Yes. “It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity.” – CA SB967.
In practice, no. It doesn’t matter how outrageous a woman acts or behaves to Title IX. Just ask the feminist parasites who run Title IX Offices. Every single expelled/suspended person is male.

The women’s tennis team completed their three-game homestand this weekend, defeating LMU 5-2 on Friday and falling to UCSB 6-1 on Saturday. The Women of Troy are now 2-1 on the season. In the game against UCSB, senior Gabby Smith took part in the only wins of the day, both in her singles match and in her doubles match with sophomore Becca Weissmann.

“Even though we lost, I thought that everybody really competed well, and there are places where we can improve,” Smith said. “It was a fun match. Obviously I want to win, but I want the team to win more.”
Although the loss hurt them in the standings, coach Alison Swain sees the game against UCSB and LMU as learning experiences. 
“I think the girls had great insight after the match and clarity about how we’re going to handle being pushed by other teams,” Swain said. “And also what we did so well against LMU and in our win against San Diego, which was coming out with a lot of focused energy and cohesiveness as a team. I think the first three matches really shined a light on how important that is for us. So we’ll take that into this weekend and our upcoming matches for sure.”
Sophomore Constance Branstine and her partner, senior Madison Westby, took home the first win of the game against LMU, defeating the other team 6-0. Branstine attributes her success to their consistency. 
“We were making our shots and sticking to the plan, and regardless of the score — we won that, I believe, 6-0 — our plan just worked every time, and all of our hard work that we did on the court really shone that day,” Branstine said. “I think that I executed my volleys really well, and Madison has a big serve, and she set me up really well, and vice versa. We work really well together.”
Branstine is a transfer student from UC Irvine this year, and appreciates the culture and atmosphere of her new team.
 “I think that we all have the same goals in life, and with us all wanting to get better every day, and learn from our mistakes and from every match and practices,” she said. “I think that now I’m on a team where everybody just works really hard, and I’m so happy to be part of such an amazing atmosphere every day.”
The next match the Women of Troy play will be at Clemson University on Jan. 26. Swain is ready for both the challenge and the learning lesson that a top team like Clemson will present. 
“We’re going to travel across the country, have a time change, be in a little different setting,” Swain said. “I think all those things are actually good for us. I want our team to be gritty and adaptable. It’s early season still, these are very important matches, but we’re also going to use them, win or lose, as stepping stones.”
Looking at the rest of the season, Swain is content to let the players decide on how ambitious they would like to be. 
“I really let the girls set the outcome goal,” she said. “I think that’s up to them, that’s something they need to put out there and believe in. For me and for our coaching staff, it’s about them determining those, and then it’s about helping them lead the path to get there.”
The team’s next home game will be against Cal on Feb. 23.
There is no excuse for losing to UCSB by such a large spread. Had high hopes with the new Coach, but now
her comments are disheartening. Maybe she is over her head coming from a Div. 3 school.

This week, former USC outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu began preparation for the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala., in an annual showcase of college football talent. He currently projects to be a late-first to second-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. 
In his senior season, Uchenna Nwosu recorded a career-high 9.5 sacks. He is projected to be a first-or second-round pick. Daily Trojan file photo.
The 6-foot-2, 240-pound edge rusher finished with 75 tackles, 9.5 sacks and 13 pass deflections in 2017. For his efforts, he earned first-team All Pac-12 honors. 
On his career, the Carson, Calif. native recorded 169 tackles with 20.5 tackles for loss. He capped off his career with a twosack, four-tackle performance against Ohio State the Cotton Bowl. 
Nwosu has the opportunity to improve upon his draft stock with an eye-opening performance in the Senior Bowl. He will play against the likes of 2017 Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Baker Mayfield, and former Washington State quarterback Luke Falk (whom he intercepted this year). 
USA Today’s “Draft Wire,” calls Nwosu an, “undersized but explosive and productive edge player,” who has made, “huge strides over the past two seasons, turning himself into one of the most intriguing defensive prospects in this draft.” 
NFLDraftScout.com ranks Nwosu as the fourth-best outside linebacker in the 2018 draft class. 
Nwosu is the lone player to represent USC in the Senior Bowl this year. Previous Trojans who were featured in the game include Clay Matthews, Carson Palmer and Lynn Swann. 
He will be a participant on the “South Team,” which is set to be coached by the Houston Texans staff. The “North Team,” will be coached by the Denver Broncos’ staff.
This year’s Senior Bowl takes place Saturday at 11:30 a.m. The game will be broadcast on NFL Network with ongoing practice coverage throughout the week on ESPNU.

The Trojan track and field team began the indoor season with an impressive effort at the MLK Jr. Invitational meet in Albuquerque, N.M.. The outing resulted in 17 top-3 finishes, including seven wins as the Trojan athletes faced off against competitors from the likes of UCLA, Fresno State and Grand Canyon University over the two-day meet marking the beginning of a season filled with high expectations.

The big winners of the meet showed no signs of rust as they came off to a scorching start to the season. Freshman Zach Schinnick and sophomore Kyra Constantine won the men’s and women’s 400 meter dashes with times of 46.49 and 53.2, respectively. With her time, Constantine also set a personal record. 
Redshirt junior Ky Westbrook put up a blazing 7.29 second time in the women’s 60m dash to win the final for the event, while teammate sophomore Zaria Francis came in second with a time of 7.34. 
Senior Kendall Ellis ran a 23.29 to win the women’s 200m, followed by fellow teammates sophomore Anna Cockrell, Westbrook, freshman Twanisha Terry and Constantine, who placed from second to fifth, leading to a USC sweep of the top 5 spots in the event. USC also dominated the 400m relays, with wins for both the men’s and women’s teams. 
To round out the winners pantheon, senior Dominic Smallwood dominated in the triple jump, winning on a 55-10.25 jump after only taking three jumps, which would end up being the three best jumps of the day.
The Trojan athletes impressed across the board, notching noteworthy finishes in the field events. In men’s long jump, redshirt senior Eric Sloan captured second place with a jump of 25-7.25, the top distance for any collegian at the meet. Junior Margaux Jones also placed second in the women’s long jump, jumping an impressive 20-8. 
In men’s high jump, senior Randall Cunningham found himself in a tie for third place with a jump of 6-9.5. 
The USC shot putters also put up strong performances, with top-3 finishes in both the women’s and men’s event. Redshirt senior Breana Jemison achieved a distance of 56-8, earning her second place, while junior Matthew Katnik reached 62-9.25 to secure a third place spot. Both distances were worthy of qualifying for Nationals—an impressive feat for the first meet of the season.
The team found similar levels of success on the track. In the women’s 60m hurdles, the four collegiate finalists were all Trojans. Redshirt junior Dior Hall placed second on a time of 7.98, followed by Cockrell at 8.02 in third. Freshman Chanel Brissett and sophomore Mecca McGlaston rounded out the USC contingent in the event, coming in fifth and eighth, respectively, with times of 8.15 and 8.35. Sophomore T.J. Brock ran a time of 6.65 in the 60m dash to win second place, setting a new personal record. Senior Robert Ford placed second in the 600m dash with a time of 1:18.51.
The team looks to carry over the success from the first meet of the season going forward as they prepare for a meet in Arkansas this coming weekend. Though the competition will be stiff coming from SEC schools such as Arkansas and Georgia, the team remains unfazed and confident in their abilities. 
“We have so much talent on this team; we are really looking stronger than ever,” junior heptathlete Lyndsey Lopes said.
If their efforts from the opening meet are indicative of anything, the team looks well-poised to be successful down the stretch of this season.

The most common complaint about the NBA in 2018 is that it lacks competition.
At the end of the day, the Warriors and Cavs will always find themselves playing each other in the NBA Finals, critics lament. Many NBA critics feel that the 82-game regular season and four-round Playoffs are just window dressings when the conclusion is already set in stone. 
On the other hand, fans around the country love the NFL for the exact opposite reason. They enjoy the league’s perception of parity, where each team possesses an equal shot at winning a championship, despite its previous season’s record. The four-round, single-elimination Playoff format creates a sense that any team can make a run for first place, much like the New York Giants in 2007 and 2011 (shoutout to my former sports editor Ollie Jung, a die-hard Giants fan).
Yet, as the NFL gets ready for its 52nd Super Bowl on Feb. 4, the Football League faces predictability issues similar to the NBA’s. 
Since 2003, only four different quarterbacks have won the AFC Championship: Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Ben Roethlisberger and Joe Flacco (the obvious outlier). 
For Brady, 40, this will be his eighth Super Bowl appearance in his 18-year career. He’s had an extended run of greatness that’s been ongoing since my first days of watching sports. 
Yes, the NFL’s highly touted parity does exist, but only across half of the league. Compared to the AFC Championship, 13 different quarterbacks have won the NFC Championship since 2003. There are some future Hall of Famers in that group, like Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees and Russell Wilson. But there are many more Flacco-esque head scratchers like Colin Kaepernick, Rex Grossman and 2018 winner Nick Foles.

For the most part, superior play by a few quarterbacks in the AFC has translated directly to more wins in the Super Bowl. Since Brady’s first appearance, the AFC is 11-6 in the Super Bowl, with another win likely on the way in two weeks. The AFC’s run is not quite on the level of the NBA Western Conference’s utter domination, but it’s pretty damn close. 
The NFL’s AFC problem starts with a lack of depth at the quarterback position. Aside from bouts with Manning and Roethlisberger, Brady simply hasn’t experienced much competition in getting to the Super Bowl. This year, he defeated Marcus Mariota of the Tennessee Titans and Blake Bortles of the Jacksonville Jaguars in the playoffs —  two quarterbacks who ranked in the bottom half of the league for completion percentage. A sixth Super Bowl victory in Minnesota would certainly be impressive, but Brady didn’t exactly go through a difficult road to get there. 
Several recent draft classes looked promising in terms of quarterback talent, but players ended up not panning out as expected. 2012 offered Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III as can’t-miss prospects. Both of their careers have since been derailed by injuries. 
In 2015, two Heisman Trophy winners in Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota were drafted No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. They were supposed to take over as the new group of elite NFL quarterbacks sooner rather than later, yet in 2017, both showed signs of regression. Their teams (the Buccaneers and Titans) finished with a combined record of 13-19. 
NFL teams need to get better at scouting and developing young quarterbacks in order to make the league more interesting, and prevent older “signal callers” from continuously dominating the league. 
This year’s quarterback draft class includes several talented prospects including USC’s Sam Darnold, UCLA’s Josh Rosen, Wyoming’s Josh Allen and Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield from Oklahoma. But only time will tell if any rise up to challenge the Roethlisberger-Brady hierarchy. 
In the meantime, a 40-year-old quarterback will attempt to win his sixth Super Bowl, with the narrative feeling all too familiar for a league that prides itself on producing the unexpected. 
This week, I wanted to start doing something a little different with my column. From now on, I’ll be concluding with three things I enjoyed in sports this week: 
1. Andrew Wiggins’ game against the Clippers on Monday night. 
I had the pleasure of attending the Clippers-Timberwolves game at the Staples Center. Both teams were ravaged by injuries. Deandre Jordan, Danilo Gallinari and Patrick Beverly all sat out for the Clippers while Jimmy Butler and Jamal Crawford were unable to play for Minnesota. Still, the two Western conference foes turned in an intense, fun and fast paced game. The T-Wolves ultimately eked out a close victory thanks to a spectacular 40-point performance by Andrew Wiggins. With Karl-Anthony Towns and Butler on the roster, it’s easy to forget about Wiggins. On Monday, he reminded everyone why that’s a very bad idea.
2. USC’s four-game winning streak
I wrote about the Men’s Basketball team’s current winning streak in more detail on Monday, but it’s worth bringing up again. They have a talented enough roster to make a run in the NCAA Tournament, and now they’re finally playing up to that potential. USC should be a fun team to watch over the last half of conference play. 
3. Jake Olson “throwing dimes” 
When the Trojans were in Dallas for the Cotton Bowl, video surfaced of the team’s blind long-snapper launching drives at TopGolf. Olson showed off more of his incredible athleticism on Monday, as the USC Athletics Instagram page posted video of him of completing perfect passes on the football field. Olson continues to inspire and amaze (also don’t count him out of the 2018 USC quarterback competition).
