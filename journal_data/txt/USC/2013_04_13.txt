This weekend brings USC a total of FOUR productions- I hope you have a clear schedule! We have three SDA productions;  Mrs. Packard, Morning View and The Most Happy Fella,, and an independent student production The Pink House One Acts. Here’s the run-down:
Mrs. Packard by Emily Mann is a very dramatic period piece revolving around a law from 1850s America that allowed a husband to commit his wife to an insane asylum without being declared so by a doctor. Based on a true story, we follow the life of Elizabeth Packard (played by a daring and tenacious Sylvie Baldwin) as her husband sends her to the Jacksonville Mental Hospital against her will. As she stuggles to convince those around her of her sanity, she must discover what “being sane,” truly means. The large cast is wonderfully convincing of the horrific conditions Mrs. Packard and her fellow inmates were subject to, including fun and disturbing scenes of manic patients.
Baldwin is truly the star of the show—there are very few moments when she leaves the stage, and reaches incredible emotional peaks.  Her performance would be impressive for any actor, but especially so considering she is merely a freshman.  Her stamina and commitment is enviable, especially during a scene when her head is dunked repeatedly in a bucket of water. The audience was on the edge of their seat in horror. Though some members of the cast were weak, the incredible and haunting story shines through, making this production both informative and artistic. The show runs April 11-14 in the McClintock Theater.
Every spring, the School of Dramatic Arts produces a New Works Festival of plays written by MFA Dramatic Writing students in their second year.  The first in this year’s series is Morning View, written by Jesse Mu-En Shao. The New Works Festival productions are always interesting, because the rehearsals are usually more geared toward the process, rather than the product, especially for the playwright.  The actors may even receive new scenes or dialogue the day of the show. It is a fantastic chance to experience other aspects of the School of Dramatic Arts, and see productions written by a student who could become the next Tennessee Williams.  The show runs April 12-14 in the Massman Theater.
Continuing the theme of student-written productions, the Pink House One-Acts is a night of just that; two short plays produced entirely by students. Contrary to many ISPs, this production is completely independent of any student organization—the name comes from the nickname for a house on Hoover that some of the participants live in.  The first one-act is written by Sarah Tither-Kaplan and directed by Caspar Brun, entitled “Eat the Rain.” Described as “a dark comedy questioning the lengths we will go to for those bound to us by blood and love,“ the talented cast is sure to put on en entertaining evening. The second play, “Henry and Joan,” was written and directed by Philip Labes, which always adds a fun element.  This play seems to appeal to the human spirit, and is said to be about “Sex, Talent and Money.” This show runs April 11-14 in the Village Gate Theater.
This is the last weekend for the school musical, The Most Happy Fella, which received rave reviews during its first five shows. Runs April 11-14 in the Bing Theater; for details, see last week’s post.
Stay tuned for more theater next week. Did you see any of these shows? Let us know what you thought in the comments!

The game Defiance came out on April 2nd. This is noteworthy for a few reasons, despite the lack of reviews. Firstly, it’s a rare massive multiplayer online role playing game (MMO) that one can play not only on a computer, but on standard gaming consoles (except the Wii, of course).
Defiance is a third person shooter, which gives the player more visibility of his or her surroundings but is arguably less immersive than first-person shooters like the recent release BioShock: Infinite. It’s also connected intricately to a new TV show of the same name, premiering on Syfy next week.
The game and the show have been tied together all through production, and presumably the overarching plot of the game will follow the show. This has never been done before. Sure, the idea to immerse a player in a world he or she already loves has been explored. My roommate has been subjected to my rambling for a solid ten minutes about exactly how they depicted a certain region of Middle Earth in Lord of the Rings Online, or how ridiculously frustrating one of the main characters is in a partner for a quest (Legolas. Seriously.).
Irritation aside, imagine involving yourself in the world of your favourite series, exploring the sets that you don’t get to see on TV, fighting alongside the main characters in the show. It’s wicked, right? One of the things that makes Defiance so intriguing is that the world in which the player enters yet lacks an ending. It’s true that the player’s gameplay experience will not change the course of the show. But one could imagine that was the case, yes? This game is promised to develop along with the show, to an unknown ending: the mystery itself is enticing.
The business model is also extremely clever, and I would hazard that it was a calculated move to release the game two weeks before the show. If they are successful, their successes should feed off of each other. If someone plays the game in these two weeks and likes it, or at least its storyline, they will probably tune in to the show. This would boost ratings and get it more coverage, and if the show was good, more people would start watching it. Those who watched it and enjoyed it may want to experience it in the fullest way possible, in which case they would look into playing the game that is accessible in Windows, the Xbox 360, and the Playstation 3.
However, this hopefully mutually beneficial relationship could turn out to be mutually destructive. If the game isn’t so great, people may not be interested in the show; if the show isn’t great, it certainly wouldn’t inspire them to play the game. The MMO came out too recently for there to be a lot of reviews; that being said, its score on Metacritic is only a 68 at this point. It could swing in any direction with more gameplay, but it’s not off to the best start.
Regardless of the success of this experiment, though, the logic behind it is sound. Games have been coming out with movies for years, and even TV shows. This, though, is a full realization of that concept. And, because this set was designed with each other in mind, one can hopefully expect an immersive overall experience. Even if Defiance is unsuccessful, someone else will try this method again. If they are successful, however, how will it impact the relationship between the gaming, film, and television industries? It could fade into oblivion, but it’s unlikely; perhaps it will encourage more discussions between industries, which will hopefully lead to a better overall experience for us, the consumers.
Dear Disgruntled Reader,
If you want ‘real’ gaming news, go off to IGN or Kotaku. If video games get covered here at all, be thankful someone had enough interest to talk about them seriously and managed to be factually accurate. Gamestop can’t even manage that at times.
How about reading the article before you decide to trash it? This article was clearly more about the ‘new’ interaction of a television show intertwining with the game, not a review of the mmo or show specifically. Also note: she called it an MMO third person shooter, not an MMORPG, not once. I would hazard a guess the tag calling it an MMORPG as well as a review were included by a possibly technology illiterate editor who didn’t bother to read the article either.
Well it’s important to remember that this is an MMO, a genre of game that is basically accepted as buggy and incomplete at release–the hope is always that the game will be added onto, fixed, and generally be made great over the course of months or years. And although I haven’t played it yet myself, from what I’ve read and seen so far, I think Defiance has the potential to be great. I might’ve bought it already but my bank account is looking pretty desolate at the moment, but that’s okay because I have Blockbuster @Home from DISH. Working at DISH I try to test out all the different services we come out with, and I love this one. Before I got it, my gaming habit got ridiculously expensive. But since Blockbuster @Home is a flat pay-by-the-month service, my bill is always the same, no matter how many games I go through in a month–it’s saved me a lot of money!
Dear Daily Trojan – 
Hate to be an angry nerd by calling out fellow writers, but I’ve noticed: you guys should really get a dedicated games writer on staff who knows how to write about video games. I sigh everytime I read the DT talk about video games and it’s heaping praise on a game that doesn’t really deserve it (e.g. praising GoW: Judgment just because it’s a Gears game) or it just doesn’t sound like the writer knows how to comfortably talk about video games, as is the case here and in some other articles.
Instead of referring just to the Metacritic score, the writer should’ve played the game herself. MMORPG and third-person shooter are technically separate categories – you would never call SWTOR a third person shooter either. Part of the problem is probably trying to toe the line to appease readers who don’t understand games along with those who do. Appeasing the latter (and not having to explain MMO and FPS and TPS) is probably a better bet. 
The DT needs writers who know how to provide good critical feedback on video games based on their own gameplay experience and ideally even foster relationships with publishers.
