​​This article is the first in the Daily Trojan news section’s expansion into coverage of South L.A. The Daily Trojan has not, in the past, dedicated coverage to news from the neighborhoods surrounding USC’s University Park Campus. We are making this change to better serve the greater community in which USC is situated and to inform USC community members about issues that extend past USC’s gates. 
The interior of the South LA Cafe is divided in half by a towering painting of Nipsey Hussle, the late rapper, entrepreneur and activist. On one side, customers order house-made coffee, pastries and avocado toast; On the other side, volunteers prepare dozens of tote bags filled with free groceries to give to the local community each Wednesday.
The South LA Cafe is a Black-owned cafe that opened in December 2019. Its founders, husband and wife duo Joe and Celia Ward-Wallace, created the cafe to address racial, social, economic and food inequity by selling food at affordable prices and creating job opportunities to invest back into the community. 
Joe Ward-Wallace is an administrator for the Los Angeles Fire Department, entrepreneur and real estate agent. Anita Lopez, who has been receiving free groceries from the cafe for two years, said that Ward-Wallace has a kindness with which he receives visitors to the cafe.
“[Joe] has a very kind heart,” Lopez said. “I’ve seen people come in here and they get mad and they have an attitude. And he’s able to talk to them. He doesn’t yell … and I feel that not a lot of people have that gift.”
Celia Ward-Wallace is a business consultant, entrepreneur and longtime social justice advocate. She brought her own experience with racial justice to the cafe — passed on from her parents, both lifelong political advocates — along with her expertise in building businesses with an impact. 
“Celia definitely drops gems every day,” said Petra McMoore, a South LA Cafe employee, about the mentorship that Ward-Wallace provides for staff members. 
The cafe’s mission is to address food insecurity — the inaccessibility of healthy, fresh food — which is a major issue in South Central that disproportionately affects marginalized groups. A 2022 study, jointly conducted by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Keck School of Medicine, found that 24.3% of L.A. County residents were food insecure in 2022, the majority of which identified as Hispanic or Latine. With a lack of affordable, healthy food options, people who experience food insecurity are forced to choose fast food and other cheaper, yet less healthy options, according to a study published by the L.A. County Department of Public Health. Often, this results in diet-related chronic conditions such as obesity, high blood pressure and heart disease, among others, according to the same study.
I’ve been to other food banks and it’s not the same. Other places are like, “OK, you’re just here, in and out, bye.” But not [at the South LA Cafe]: They don’t make you feel ashamed that you’re coming here because you’re less fortunate or you don’t have the funds to have the food on your table.
Jennifer Johns, a local musician, food justice advocate and daily patron of the South LA Cafe, said she believes access to healthy food is critical in addressing challenges like the school-to-prison pipeline — a national trend in which harsh school policies, such as zero-tolerance discipline, leads students into the criminal justice system which disproportionately affects Black students, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.
“One of the major components to education, or the ability to retain information and education, is about nutrition or your access to real nutrition,” Johns said. “If we’re looking at how we want to stop the cycle of violence in our communities, and we want to stop the cycle of sending people to prison … access to real food is absolutely the very first step.”
Though the South LA Cafe began as a cafe, it soon expanded its operations to host open mic nights, live events, podcast recording sessions and much more support the local community. The Ward-Wallaces also launched an affordable grocery store called the South LA Market. 
The South LA Cafe opened a second location at Kaiser Permanente Baldwin Hills Crenshaw in October and recently announced a partnership to contribute to catering, a new cafe and a new restaurant for the L.A. Natural History Museum.
The presence of a community-led, community-driven business in South Central becomes increasingly important as more longtime residents are priced-out of the region and the makeup of the community continues to change due to gentrification. A study by the UCLA Urban Displacement Project found that the number of gentrified census tracts in L.A. County increased by 16% between 1990 and 2015, and the trend shows little signs of stopping.
“[South LA Cafe] became the heartbeat of this particular thoroughfare because there’s a Starbucks pretty much within a mile of where we are. And if you go towards USC, there’s literally three Starbucks in between a quarter mile,” said Damon Turner, founder of Trap Heals — a company focused on investment in the community through arts and culture — and daily patron of the cafe. “So, to be able to have a community-led, community-driven cafe right here in the middle of Western and King, I think it just really opened up an opportunity not only to be able to hire locally, but for folks who buy coffee to get some really good coffee.”
By the time the coronavirus pandemic began spreading in early 2020, the South LA Cafe changed once again, introducing Grocery Giveaways. Each Wednesday, hundreds of people in need from the local community receive a tote bag filled with free healthy groceries — carrots, potatoes, tortillas, chicken and much more.
After losing two loved ones during the pandemic and suffering from a decreased income, the grocery giveaways meant everything to Lopez, but she said the impact extends beyond having food on the table.
“I’ve been to other food banks and it’s not the same,” Lopez said. “Other places are like, ‘OK, you’re just here, in and out, bye.’ But not [at the South LA Cafe]: They don’t make you feel ashamed that you’re coming here because you’re less fortunate or you don’t have the funds to have the food on your table.”
Johns and Turner said they visited the South LA Cafe each day for almost an entire year, partially to satisfy Johns’ “chai addiction,” but to enjoy the community as well.   
“It’s like Cheers; everybody knows your name,” Johns said. “If I come in here without [Turner], they’re asking about him. If he comes in here without me, they’re asking about me. It’s a community.”

Hiking through the trails of Baldwin Hills with friends, Nia McMillan stumbled upon a revolutionary idea: WOODLUMS, a student organization dedicated to addressing environmental racism and making nature accessible to Black people.
With the hope of incorporating outdoor immersion, education and applied restorative justice frameworks, McMillan, a junior majoring in journalism, founded WOODLUMS and led the organization’s first meeting Jan. 25. The name — a play on the derogatory term “hoodlum” — puts a spin on a word often associated with Black people, McMillan said.
“[My friend] Corey came up with the name and … it instantly made sense,” McMillan wrote. “[It] is symbolic of many of the major themes of the organization, namely the general rejection of white supremacy and white supremacist standards of value … It captures the playful, witty, tongue-in-cheek mood of our organization.” 
WOODLUMS defines environmental racism as a form of institutionalized racism that targets Black communities, which are disproportionately centered in areas with extreme pollutants or near factories that can cause an increased risk of mental and physical ailments. 
During its founding meeting, the executive board went over WOODLUMS’ organizational goals, which involve organizing outdoor events such as hikes, camping trips, wellness events, picnics, water fights and field days. These events focus on getting Black students  outdoors and making nature’s holistic healing powers accessible, McMillan said. WOODLUMS’ upcoming hike to Millard Falls will take place Feb. 20. 
“I love being outside. I want other people to be outside with me,” McMillan said. “I feel like from a very young age, certain things like camping, hiking or skiing have been labeled ‘white people stuff,’ and I don’t think that should be the case. I want to counter that and introduce people to outdoor spaces because … they’ve been healing for me.”
WOODLUMS established distinct membership tiers. Members of the general body attend meetings and events at their own leisure. Members seeking more involvement can join the restorative justice committee or the community outreach and special projects committee. Members who look to plan and lead hikes can apply to become a guide. 
In the context of the club’s mission, WOODLUMS vice president Taylor-Corrine Benton explained the importance of outdoor immersion, education and applied restorative justice frameworks.
“We are an active resource in combating the mental, individual, communal and general bodily harms of environmental racism by introducing it and reintroducing Black people into nature,” said Benton, a junior majoring in American studies & ethnicity.
Recognizing that many outside their circles may be unaware of the effects of environmental racism, WOODLUMS looks to provide educational opportunities for people outside the organization, while also leading detailed discussions and lectures for their members.
“[Environmental racism] is a very big issue … that we want to educate everybody about,” McMillan said. “Black people not only need to be a part of but need to be centered in conversations around environmental justice … The mental toll of not seeing greenness and soil … [or] having clean air and stuff like that is problematic.” 
The organization currently has 60 members and seeks to ensure that all events are affordable to everyone. WOODLUMS restorative justice leader and junior majoring in sociology Anika Ricks said she recognizes the socioeconomic disparities associated with certain outdoor activities. 
“We’re focusing on funding and trying to make sure that the activities that we have are basically free or as close to free as possible for these Black students,” said Ricks, a junior majoring in sociology. “It’s just another burden to [have] … people be cut off from [the outdoors] because they can’t afford it.”
With the goal of making their hikes accessible to the greater Los Angeles community — particularly local schools — WOODLUMS aims to file as an official nonprofit by the end of the semester. 
“It’s starting out prioritizing Black students at USC, but we want to expand and be able to touch youth in South L.A. and [those] who might not have opportunities to do this kind of stuff otherwise,” McMillan said. “[We want] to expose them to the outdoors and create inclusive spaces for Black people [for] our culture [to] be celebrated and expressed.”

Students and recruiters from some of the world’s most famous companies gathered in the Trojan Grand Ballroom Wednesday night for USC’s first annual Black Career Fair, hosted by the Black Student Assembly. 
Over 500 students registered to attend and networked with recruiters, formed relationships, found mentors and inquired about job opportunities. 
Emery Ogah, a junior majoring in business and BSA co-executive director, was incredibly excited to host the event.
“This is the first time we’ve ever done this. It’s exciting to bring something new to USC in general, but to bring something for the Black student population here that’s already small, is so meaningful,” Ogah said.
The inspiration for the fair came from Ire Omitowoju, a junior majoring in arts, technology, and the business of innovation and BSA programming chair. She had noticed gaps in professional development opportunities for Black students at USC and wanted to make sure a space existed for them to network. Career services at predominantly white institutions, she said, weren’t designed with Black students’ unique experiences and concerns in mind.
“I presented the idea when I was onboarded [as programming chair] and Candace was like, ‘I love this idea. Let’s make it happen,’” Omitowoju said, referring to Candace House, a junior majoring in business of cinematic arts and BSA co-executive director. “We became partners in this and we have an amazing committee. We’ve been working since the summer to bring this to life.”
Omitowoju said she was optimistic about the culmination of her work and hoped it could provide students a unique chance to discover future careers.
“I hope that [participating students] are able to create genuine connections with the people that came, whether it’s the Black recruiters or other students as well. And also just be able to understand what it’s like to be Black in whatever industry that they’re interested in,” Omitowoju said.
Industries represented included entertainment, consulting, architecture and engineering, with recruiters from NFL, Paramount, Sony, PlayStation, Riot Games, Medtronic, Chromatic, Hawk, McKinsey, Deloitte, KPMG, SoundCloud and Boeing all in attendance. 
Marcel Apatewen, a sophomore majoring in health and human sciences, said he was encouraged by the number of participating companies. 
“I’m very impressed by the sheer diversity of the amount of companies that came and the interest that they have,” Apatewen said. “It’s really encouraging to see a lot of Black students on campus take charge of their future and network with these professionals.”
House said she was proud of the event and the work of BSA students that went into creating the fair.
“This event means the world to me,” House said. “We’ve been planning this since around the fall. Being able to cultivate it, have all of our committee members planning it week after week, getting these big companies and having the turnout we’ve had — this is the biggest turnout we’ve had from one of our signature events this year. We’ve had over 500 people registered.”
In the future, the BSA executive board is looking to expand the fair to include more opportunities and industries. 
“We hope to have more companies next year,” Ogah said, “especially with the amazing [student] turnout rate that we had this year. We hope to show that to companies next year and encourage them to come and be involved with us again.”

If I could describe my existence from the perspective of my classmates growing up with one word, it would be confusing. I am Black, but I am also a woman, and since my junior year of high school, also a hijabi. I am what my friends jokingly call a triple threat. Each of those pieces of my identity comes with its own struggle — but also unique beauty.
The day I realized I was never going to be seen the same way as my white friends was in the seventh grade, when some kid in my social studies class made a comment about my skin. He said, very simply, “You’re so dark.” A man of many words.
He barely knew who I was, and I didn’t know who he was either. I realized that while in my eyes he was just another white kid in a school full of white kids, to him, I was that one Black girl. I finally understood why Nathan from Mr. Mackenzie’s second period social studies class would never wonder what I liked to do for fun.
I understood prejudice at a young age — which was a common occurrence in my life. Up to that point, and for a long time after that, I had heard it all. Until that one off comment, I hadn’t grasped that before anyone cared to get to know who I was, the first thing they would see was my race, and how different it was. To say the least, it drastically affected how they interacted with me — especially in Gilbert, Arizona. My personality, or anything else about me didn’t matter. I was simply an enigma. A science experiment to poke and prod and test the limits of. A museum exhibit to stare at. 
From then on, I noticed how differently my peers treated me, even before I started wearing the hijab. To me, the worst of it wasn’t even the blatantly prejudiced or ignorant comments — someone even asked me if my box braids grew out of my head that way — but how people tiptoed around me. They were a little too polite, in a way that felt like overcompensation. I just wanted them to treat me like they would anyone else while appreciating my differences.
I was slowly learning that no matter how I present myself, depending on where I am, people will always see me as Black first, or a woman first, or Muslim first — never a person that was all three and more than that. In high school, they saw me as a confusing representation of everything foreign they didn’t understand. After I started wearing the hijab, I was told numerous times that I “couldn’t be Muslim because I was Black.” 
In Muslim spaces, while not so severely, my family was also the minority. While my mosque was an amalgamation of so many different cultures and countries, there weren’t so many African Muslim families where we lived. There were a couple of instances where people assumed my mom was a cleaning lady — like Aisha, the older Senegalese woman who cleaned the mosque in my community out of the kindness of her own heart, and that my parents could speak Wolof with.
The intersection of my identities make them each more complicated than if I was the perceived “default” of each — for instance, a white woman. When learning about the history of Black people in America, it was important for me to learn that Black women are not afforded the same courtesies as white women in this country or anywhere, and that being a hijabi also added on to that disparity — especially in spaces like healthcare and the workplace. But that’s a topic that deserves an article of its own. 
My takeaways from my experiences as a Black hijabi are, one: that a large part of prejudice is simply ignorance. So many people simply don’t know much about the history of Black people in America, Islam, Africa or even the difference between race, ethnicity and nationality. As for the second takeaway, while my life and identity can be complicated, I would never trade it for the world.  
I love who I am. I love that I am the only person in the continental United States named Penda Ba. I love that sometimes I struggle to match my hijab to the rest of my outfit and that my family eats together from a big, intricately designed Mauritanian plate on the floor of the living room instead of the table. I love learning how to ask for more rice in my Muslim friends’ native languages. I love my parents’ tea addiction and my brother’s basketball shoe collection, and going to the mosque every Friday, and not celebrating Christmas, and my family’s frantic rush to get ready and leave the house in the morning on Eid. I love watching cartoons with my brothers for hours while my mom braids my hair, screaming Playboi Carti lyrics with my friends and all the little things about who I am that to so many people, are so different and confusing.
While I look back at the journey I took to get to this point of completely loving my identity and feeling supported in it, this Black History Month — and World Hijab Day — I am also thinking of all the other Black American hijabis who are on the same path. Don’t forget to hug your Black friends, Happy Black History Month and remember that we are all more than what we present to be.

Like Vice President Kamala Harris, I love having a good laugh. As Fergie said, “A little party never killed nobody.” Right? And speaking of laughs, if you are anything like the social-media-loving college student, I am sure you have seen the constant memes circling Twitter and Instagram about Vice President Harris. From her endless laugh to her silky straight hair, it seems our Vice President has her head in the clouds. Or does she? Upon further inspection, it appears Vice President Harris is just one of the many Black women in power who are subject to harmful societal norms.
Vice President Harris is not only the first woman to hold her title but the first woman of color. There’s a particular sort of pressure that comes from being a Black woman in power, and with Vice President Harris having broken a glass ceiling, she has been subject to numerous racist and sexist attacks — including Donald Trump’s purposeful mispronunciation of her name and degrading Vice President Harris to a “monster” who is “unlikeable.” 
Unfortunately, this sort of thinking spans beyond Vice President Harris and stains society as a whole. The “Angry Black Woman” stereotype has been around for as long as I can remember. 
Dr. Trimiko Melancon, an associate professor of English and Africana Studies at Rhodes College, states, “You see this one as being more of a modern sort of stereotype that really mythologizes black women as hostile, aggressive.” 
Examples of this stereotype can be seen in the comments thrown at Serena Williams, Michelle Obama and Jemele Hill. While Black women make up 7% of the United States workforce, there are few in positions of power like that of Vice President Harris. In fact, as of 2021, only two Black female CEOs were listed in the Fortune 500. Harmful caricatures, such as the angry Black woman stereotype, affect Black women in and out of the workplace, and we all must recognize this.
Black women are perceived as anywhere from sassy to disrespectful via “an attitude,” which leads to Black women being held to a higher behavioral standard than most, starting from a very young age. When viewed through the angry Black woman stereotype, anger is demonized and looked down upon. White men’s anger is a symbol of masculinity and strength. White women’s anger is perceived as a push for action, yet Black women’s anger leaves them socially and professionally disadvantaged. Aleks Ellis, Chair of Organizational Behavior at the University of Arizona says, “People were more likely to perceive an angry Black woman as a worse performer and less capable leader.”
Stemming beyond anger is the subject of hair. From box braids to a natural ‘fro, hair in Black culture is a symbol of identity, personal expression and freedom. Yet, hair has been a particularly controversial subject in the professional world for several years. After expressing her concern that her natural hair might be used as a distraction or politicized, former First Lady, Michelle Obama put it best, “Let me keep my hair straight. Let’s get healthcare passed.”
Natural hair has been deemed as anything from unprofessional to downright distracting. Take Andrew Johnson, a Black high school student in New Jersey who was forced to cut off his locs before competing in a wrestling match. Or Marissa Martino, a high school student in Oregon, who was forced to cut the beads off her braids to get the chance to play in her volleyball game. A study conducted by Dove found that Black women are 3.5% more likely to be perceived as “unprofessional” because of their hair, and 66% of Black children in majority-white schools have faced race-based hair discrimination.
I’m sure you’ve read this and will stick to the notion that the constant memes and jokes about Vice President Harris are hilarious. And this isn’t to say that they aren’t; I still giggle whenever I hear, “The wheels on the bus go ’round and ’round.” However, with statistics like these, it’s no wonder Vice President Harris maintains a specific look and attitude. So, next time you’re cackling at the latest silk press meme, ask yourself: what would you do in her position?

Lately, I have been directly confronting the inevitable anxieties that come from pursuing a Bachelor of Art degree in art: Will this be beneficial in my future? Can I make a career out of my artwork? Will I be left forever selling pieces on the streets of Los Angeles living off nothing but 50 cent ramen, desperation and regret for banking on my passion instead of something more “secure?” Phew. I hope not. 
Thankfully, in the midst of these all-consuming, impostor syndrome-induced thoughts, came an incredible, but equally stressful opportunity: co-curating and making pieces for my own art exhibition. 
Every spring semester, the Roski School of Art and Design offers a range of prizes and exhibitions for students to apply to from mid-February to the end of March, one of which is Independent Student Exhibitions. After being made aware of these amazing opportunities during the second semester of my sophomore year, I was instantly inspired to apply. It finally seemed like the perfect opportunity to display my work and feel as though there was a purpose for my art, an avenue into kick-starting my future desires. 
After a long few weeks of brainstorming and a healthy amount of procrastination — we may or may not have submitted the application on the exact date it was due — my exhibition partner and fellow Roski student, Angel Itua and I, put together a statement and collective portfolio of our work to submit to the Roski School Exhibition Committee. 
The theme came easily enough to us. As two Black art students, we had an instantaneous mutual agreement to maintain Blackness at the forefront of the exhibition. Rarely do I see Black art in a collective space depicted in a manner that feels equally representative and welcoming — though I would like to commemorate the California African American Museum for their success in doing so. We not only wanted to highlight injustices and oppression through our pieces, but simultaneously celebrate and honor Black diasporic cultures and its aesthetics. 
Thus, “The Black Experience” was born.
“The Black Experience” as an art exhibition felt vital. One of the biggest things that propelled this show was the necessity for asserting a space that offers Black representation by Black people. Far too often I see Black history and theory being taught from the mouths of non-Black people. There are far too few Black students and professors in my courses. There is far too much Black art that is represented that solely focuses on the narratives of slavery and its lasting impressions — when Kara Walker is the only Black artist mentioned in my courses, there is a glaring issue. 
Actively creating Black space on our own terms becomes a form of resistance to the confines of the intensely Eurocentric — and derivatively heteronormative and patriarchal — art world. Black histories, extending to artifacts and arts, have been erased, neglected, manipulated and rejected for centuries. Birthed was a form of agency for me personally to depict what my experiences are like as a Black woman in a manner that feels both holistic and personally intimate. I refuse to have my narratives written by anyone other than myself, which is a much more daunting task than it may appear to be due to the lack of reception of Black art in institutional art spaces like galleries and museums. 
Creatively, one of the things I had been struggling with before the formation of “The Black Experience” was contributing to the canon of Black oppression pieces. It felt as though my identity could only be defined through marginalization because that was the most conceptually profound thing I could think of that related to me and my work. Colorism, misogynoir and fetishization always plagued my works, never themes of celebration, pride or commemoration. 
However, now as an artist I can say that being Black is enough. Being a Black woman has and will always influence the work that I create, but focusing on something as seemingly mundane as having textured hair or dark skin can be equally as impactful as depicting how institutional racism specifically targets Black women in the beauty industry. This process allowed me to find a voice in my work and put it into direct conversation with another creative for the public. I could not be more content. 
Blackness has become a powerful tool to be yielded in order to redefine what was once appropriated or obscure what was once forced into definition. The continued presence and prominence of Black art continues the much larger cultural action of reclaiming Black identities, narratives and culture. 
David Zwirner, an art dealer with an essay featured in The New York Times on art’s vitality for human existence and progression, details how art is at the center of our lives and is a pinnacle for culture. He writes, “I believe [art’s] most gratifying as an intellectual pursuit. Great art is … complex, and it expects work from us when we engage with it … Great works carry with them so many messages and meanings. And often those messages survive for centuries. Or — even more mysteriously — they change as the years and decades pass, leaving their power and import somehow undiminished.”
Zwirner goes on to assert that art is an experience that is communal, one that brings us together, stating “I would contend that art and culture are the most important vehicles by which we come to understand one another. They make us curious about that which is different or unfamiliar, and ultimately allow us to accept it, even embrace it.”
What I desire to come from this exhibition is just that: an awakening for viewers inside the gallery that consequently produces a conversation that can transcend beyond its physical space. After all, art has always been a facilitator for cultural commentary and documentation. Bringing the community together — with emphasis on the Black community — to ignite this particular cultural moment is the goal. 
Support Black creatives, support Black art.

Gordon Bellamy, professor of the practice of cinematic arts, has been in the business of video games for 30 years. Across leading positions at organizations like Electronic Arts, the International Game Developers Association, Tencent and, now, USC, Bellamy has worked to redefine perceived defaults and “help people get from point A to point B who don’t know how.”
The Daily Trojan sat down for an interview with Bellamy to discuss his career and efforts to uplift underrepresented voices across the industry.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Daily Trojan: When and how did you decide to go into the games industry?
Gordon Bellamy: I’ve always loved games, and I guess more than just loved games … I’ve always identified with games. Because, especially … as a Black person, and as a gay person, you navigate rules as you move through society. And in games, we all share a set of rules, so, games are a wonderful place where people of all unique backgrounds can be default and share time together in an experience which is that game, or, in single-player games, where we can have the same experience as each other, much like reading a great book or seeing a great film, where we’re given at least the same set of parameters. Just like you may read a book differently than someone, or you may enjoy a film differently than someone, you may enjoy and create a game experience that’s different. But you’re sharing an experience, undeniably, that … makes you closer as people and, maybe, reminds you that we have so much more in common than we have different. 
DT: What was your first job, and how did it compare to school?
GB: I went to college as an AT&T Bell Labs Scholar. So, every summer, I would intern at a laboratory, exploring technology, which was great for learning also because it enabled me to buy my first Sega Genesis. That’s what I really remember. My first paycheck, I went directly to the video game store and bought a Sega Genesis of my own. But my first job professionally, I took a gap year during college to go to Electronic Arts, and so I was the global rookie of the year for Electronic Arts before I finished college. Then I went back to school, finished my GEs, as they’re called at USC, and graduated. And then went back to work. 
My first job was about learning the difference between individual achievement and collaborative creation. Games are a collaboration at the end of the day, between you as the developer and your team, you and the player, you and whoever is distributing your game. I think you, usually, historically, get into school because of your individual achievement and you’ll say, “these are my grades, these are my test scores, this is my community service, this is my experience with this critical thinking, so on and so forth. Pick me.” Right? And actual work, like your first job, is really about, “How well do you work with other people? How well do you bring yourself as an additive person to something bigger than yourself?’ … That’s what my first job [at EA] was like, and it was thrilling. We had the biggest game in the country [Madden], and so it was exciting to have something that you could share with so many people as a lived experience. And even now, we’re talking about it … So, that is one of the greatest gifts of my first job, is working on something that I’ve gotten to share with people for the rest of my life.
DT: Could you tell the story of how you got the graphics of Madden to reflect the actual player demographics?
GB: I love talking about this. Let me contextualize: There were a couple of intersecting features that we brought into the design of Madden that year. For me, the core feature was actually create-a-player. Because I, in my uniqueness, wanted to bring myself and my friends into the game. I love football, and I love watching it, but part of the fantasy was that we could be in the NFL playing alongside our heroes. So, we devoted a lot of energy to creating a player and being able to add yourself to the universe. 
The second question, which was just as important, was, “What is a default player?” And for underrepresented people, often, you have to toggle to find yourself in a game, if you’re even available in this game. And whether that be across gender, or socioeconomic, or race or orientation, you have to toggle, toggle, toggle and, hopefully, find a representation, or make a representation, of yourself. In the NFL, the default player is African American. Majority of players, it’s what they are. And so when I was in a position to define the default player, that’s what I did. And I did it because it was right, but also for myself and so that other young people could see themselves as default when they’re growing up, and even people who weren’t African American could be like, “Oh, there’s other defaults. Let me begin to look for places where I’m default. That I can be the hero.” At the time, I imagine Tomb Raider was also just emerging. That’s one of the first action games where there was an empowered female default character who was not being rescued in the castle, who was not the object, but was the protagonist with weapons, solving puzzles, doing all the things that people who identify as female have done throughout history, as default, no changing. 
I feel as though the Madden players [were] another meaningful step for a lot of people because it was in the most popular game. That was my role as lead designer. It’s exciting just to talk about because now, here in the games program, there’s so many dimensions across which you have the opportunity to center characters and narrative … “Will we think about not just usability but accessibility so that everyone can center themselves in playing?” It’s so great, like a generation later, that there’s so many ways that we can explore default spaces for people to play.
DT: Other than EA, what do you think your favorite job has been?
GB: It’s so interesting when you ask me to summarize my career. I’ve been in games now for 30 years … We actually had our own studio, called Z-Axis, where I was creative director … We made a bunch of extreme sports games and ended up being acquired by Activision, and that was super meaningful. I’ve run both trade organizations for the game industry, so I’ve led the IGDA, the International Game Developers Association, and the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, which is like the Oscars for games. I lead business development for Tencent, which is the world’s largest game company that makes a number of games that people love through their subsidiaries, like League of Legends and Fortnite and Clash of Clans and many others. 
What unifies them, what sort of has meaning for me, why I teach in fact, is that I find purpose in helping people get from point A to point B who don’t know how. So, whether it be through designing gameplay, or through creating opportunities in business development, or through leading trade organizations, or through teaching, I love when people have dreams that I’m able to help them get closer to, with my knowledge, with my contacts, with my perspective, whatever it may be. That motivates me. And that’s, I hope, what defines my career. 
I had the privilege — I was the first Jerry Lawson award-winner … I won the 2020 Vanguard Award from Games for Change. So, it’s interesting to have the work recognized, but there’s so much work to do … I also lead the Gay Gaming Professionals. We have a 501(c)(3) focused on empowerment, expertise and entrepreneurship for all in the games industry, and we do scholarships, we do incredible YouTube content, we do events and tradeshows. [It’s] all about celebrating everyone’s excellence as default and cultivating that as they move forward through their careers, across gender, socioeconomic, neurodiversity, orientation, all of it.

The Black Art Collective is a student-run organization dedicated to the connecting, developing and spotlighting of Black creatives and Black creative projects. 
Uniting Black students for creative and artistic development, BAC has four main purposes.
“First would be the production of art … Our second thing is that we have workshops and educational events … Then, the third thing is social events … Our fourth [purpose] would be that we’re currently working on creating a database of Black creatives on campus,” said Jordan Freeman, the president of BAC and a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production. 
On Jan. 21, the organization debuted its first workshop in Burbank, California. The workshop was an advanced camera workshop taught by Elias Ginsberg, a Los Angeles-based director of photography, adjunct professor at USC and alumnus of the USC School of Cinematic Arts. 
“So our camera workshop was our first event that identified the education disparity in film, being that minorities and Black people don’t usually get the access to use higher-quality cameras,” said Tracey Gibbs, the chair of film and television for BAC and a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production.
Transportation was provided for participants and the workshop was free for both members and non-members of the Black Art Collective, with donations encouraged for non-members. 
Freeman began organizing leadership and goals for BAC in Fall 2022. At the start, they reached out to fellow Black creatives when assembling the leadership for the organization.
Gibbs explained how, last semester, she shared a class with Freeman and how that was where she expressed her interest in Freeman’s idea and subsequently got involved with the organization. 
“Jordan was talking to me a lot about it in a class we had last semester. Just about the racial disparities that they saw within our film and television program at USC. They were like ‘I’m gonna do something about it,’ and I was like ‘Well, when you do something about it, let me know. I’ll help you. I’ll be there,’” Gibbs said. “Then, they had this idea to start the collective and really identify the educational disparities between Black people at USC and want to expand it to all of the art forms that we could.”
Other board members shared similar stories of expressing interest in BAC and its mission before joining.
“Jordan texted me one day saying that she wanted to talk about starting a new organization that was geared towards Black people, Black creatives, and instantly I was interested … I think it’s because in the back of my mind, I’d always wanted something like this here at USC and I didn’t know how to put it into words,” said Neema Muteti, the co-theater chair of BAC and a freshman majoring in musical theater. 
Autumn Bryant, the social chair of BAC and a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, was thrilled when she was approached with the idea. She said she was glad Freeman approached her with this idea and that she couldn’t believe it hadn’t been explored sooner.
“I got the same text from Jordan about her thoughts on creating this organization. I’m in the same film cohort with Jordan and Tracey, so I already knew them very well … I was super, super excited to be a part of it. And as they were explaining it, I realized how necessary the organization is and I think that’s what is so exciting about it,” Bryant said.
Before coming up with the idea for BAC and organizing the board, Freeman remarked on her own time at USC and how it informed her mission to start the organization. 
“When I first came to USC, I assumed that being at the prestigious film school would be the great equalizer between all the creatives there; we’d all have access to fantastic equipment, we’d all get personalized feedback from our teachers and that it’d be more of an even playing field regardless of where we came from,” Freeman said. 
However, Freeman said they noticed how Black students were assumed to be less competent than their non-Black peers, leading Black filmmakers to not get hired for projects. Freeman emphasized that outside of class is where cinematic arts students get their “onset” education, the cornerstone of a cinematic arts education. 
“I thought it would just be more beneficial to invest into our own communities, build up our own creatives, give them the technical skills and give them the resources so that way we can all come up together rather than the mentality of being the first to do something and then extending the ladder behind you,” Freeman said.
Throughout the interview, BAC’s board emphasized that despite the cinematic background of many of its board, BAC was determined to connect Black artists across disciplines and create projects. 
“I think, through our own personal conversations and friendships and connections, we’ve kind of come to the consensus that one thing that most of the Black creatives on campus have in common is that we feel like we don’t know one another,” Bryant said. “Especially for Jordan, she decided to create this as an easy and accessible way for Black creators on campus to meet each other and create amazing projects.” 
The organization plans to produce a play (or musical), film and a music showcase per semester. Additionally, Freeman said BAC wants to collaborate with other Black affinity groups in the production of these films and showcases. 
“For example, our music showcase, which is organized by Tayler Somerville, our music chair, will be co-produced by the Black Student Assembly,” Freeman said. 
Looking to the future, Bryant expressed their excitement about the reception of BAC. 
“I think we’ve had such amazing feedback. And, honestly, it’s so motivating,” Bryant said. “Jordan, especially, but like everyone, put a lot of effort and time into making sure that we were all prepared and organized with what our goals and intentions were.”
At the heart of BAC is community, and creating a safe space for Black creatives is an essential step in supporting Black students. According to Gibbs, the feedback she’s heard and the attention that BAC has received supports that. 
“The opportunities that are being offered with our organization are getting a lot of recognition from other people around campus,” Gibbs said. “I think they’re seeing it as a safe space where they can also thrive and learn as well.”

I was lucky enough to go to SoFi Stadium last year with my little brother for a Rams game. If you are a sports fan or an avid architecture appreciator, the stadium will blow you away. The sprawling curved roof greets any plane landing at LAX and the massive plot of land where the stadium sits is complete with a man-made lake and plenty of space for parking.
The festivities were in full swing when my brother and I got out of my friend’s car for the matchup between the Rams and 49ers. Blaring music swept through the parking lot outside the stadium and cars honked as they moved at a snail-like pace through the flood of people crossing the street. 
Leaving was just as chaotic. Angry 49ers fans and jubilant Rams fans bickered in the street. Getting picked up near the stadium was out of the question — my brother and I walked a mile or so away from the area before we were able to get an Uber.
Game days will only grow more frequent in the Inglewood area, as billionaire Steve Ballmer’s Los Angeles Clippers are currently constructing an arena dubbed the Intuit Dome, which is slated to be ready for use by the 2024 to 2025 season. Advertised as being “built for the fan, by the fan,” the Clippers are the latest to take advantage of the relatively-cheap real estate in the Inglewood area.
Key phrase: “take advantage.”
In a city where Black and Latine people make up over a combined 90% of the population according to the 2021 U.S. Census, the average rent has skyrocketed, businesses have been forced to leave and an already densely-polluted area due to its proximity to LAX and the 105 and 405 freeways is seeing a rise in carbon emissions — and the health defects that they cause.
The increased traffic that game days bring to the Inglewood area will continue to rise as the Clippers open their doors to some 18,000 fans 41 times a season. Traffic is a major contributor to the area’s carbon emissions and a primary reason why more residents in Inglewood suffer from asthma and lung cancer than in other areas of L.A. County, according to a 2018 UCLA study — a study performed before the construction of the two stadiums and the future influx of thousands of Inglewood visitors.
The study also notes that noise pollution, caused by loud planes flying overhead and honking cars containing impatient Clippers or Rams fans, has a disproportionate effect on residents of Inglewood than in surrounding areas. Again, this study was performed before the madness that is a game day at SoFi Stadium.
The negative effects of SoFi Stadium and the Intuit Dome are not exceptions to a widespread issue affecting primarily low-income earning individuals and people of color throughout the country. Stadiums are often built in areas with high minority populations because they often offer cheap properties for construction to begin. Data shows that a few years after construction, properties around the stadium shoot up in value, pushing out long term residents and bringing in wealthy, predominantly white residents. 
So, clearly, it isn’t just pollution-related issues that stadiums bring to their surrounding communities.
In addition to raising the average rent, sports stadiums put financial pressure on surrounding small businesses. As new sports bars or restaurants sprout up nearby the stadium, previously existing spots face competition — often from corporate chains or wealthy investors eager to capitalize off the stadium’s draw. 
Stadiums also typically lead to a heightened police presence in the area. In communities of color, where there is a historic disproportionate mistreatment of private citizens by police officers, an increase in policing could be dangerous and unwelcome.
Inglewood, a historically Black and Latine city, has become the next “Stadium City,” and its residents are struggling as a result. From contributing to above average pollution levels to putting residents at financial strain, stadium construction is not always a home run for the communities.
The answer to this problem isn’t easy. Fans won’t stop going to Rams or Clippers games, and I don’t think they should. The allure of attending a professional sporting event is too tempting to pass up for many. But with the immense amount of money that comes in from these games and considering the high salaries of owners and players, perhaps there could be some money moved around to better support communities that are invaded by stadiums.

After defeating then No. 25-ranked Colorado last Sunday, the Trojans will try to bolster their resume for the NCAA Tournament against unranked Arizona State on Friday and No. 22 Arizona on Sunday. The Trojans are projected as a No. 9 seed in the NCAA Tournament, per ESPN. A weekend win against another ranked team would move them up even higher.
“We knew that our growth trajectory should be steeper than most teams,” said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I think our commitment to defense [and] our willingness to utilize the different weapons we have on offense … we’ve gotten some big wins because of it.”
Led by a stalwart defense, Gottlieb is amidst a 16-5 season, a dramatic turnaround from the 12-16 record the year prior. The Trojans are currently seventh in the nation in scoring defense, something that Gottlieb has attributed to the addition of Associate Head Coach Beth Burns.
The Trojans are also coming off a hot weekend offensively, scoring 144 points in two games after scoring just 114 points combined in the games against Washington and Washington State. In the last two games, graduate guard Destiny Littleton led the charge, scoring 15 points against Utah and 21 against Colorado.
Aside from Littleton, sophomore forward Rayah Marshall is averaging a double-double on the season and leads the team in rebounds per game with 10.8. She is also third in the nation in blocks per game, with an average of three.
“As far as offense, [I’m] just playing my role,” Marshall said. “If the ball is coming to me, I’m just trying to be poised.” 
Marshall and the Trojans will first tackle Arizona State. The Sun Devils are last in the Pac-12 with a conference record of 0-10 and are the only team in the conference to have a losing overall record. After starting the season off 5-0, ASU is 2-12 in its last 14 games and has not won a game since Dec. 17. The Sun Devils have been plagued by injury all season long. Earlier in the year, the Sun Devils had to forfeit two of their games because they did not have enough healthy players. Junior guard Tyi Skinner is the only player on the ASU roster that has started in every game this season. Skinner has a team-leading 18.7 points per game and shoots 34.1% from 3-point range.
“We don’t take anyone lightly,” Gottlieb said. “Tyi Skinner is a high-octane guard. She can really score, same with [Jaddan] Simmons … We’ve got to make them take tough shots, keep them off the free throw line.”
On Sunday, USC will look for its third victory against ranked opponents when they play No. 22 Arizona. The Wildcats are tied for fourth place in the Pac-12 Conference and have an overall record of 16-5. Four of the five Arizona starters average over 10 points a game. Marshall recognizes the challenge of guarding against the versatile Wildcats offense.
“I know we’re definitely coming to play with some pride and as hard as we can and trust in our defense like we always do,” Marshall said.
After scoring 79 and 80 points against Utah and ASU, respectively, the Wildcats’ offense has stalled heading into their match against the Trojans. Arizona scored 61 points in a win against Washington before scoring 59 in a loss to Washington State. USC has a 59-28 all-time record against both Arizona and ASU. The Trojans are 10-1 at home, with the only loss being against UCLA. The Wildcats are 5-3 on the road, while the Sun Devils are 3-6.
USC hosts Arizona State on Friday at 7 p.m. and Arizona on Sunday at noon as the Trojans will look to move up in the Pac-12 standings.

All rankings in this article are according to the 247 Sports Composite.
Although Early Signing Day in December was quiet for the Trojans, USC was able to land two important signings on National Signing Day Wednesday to bring their total number of high school signees to 21. Those signatures came from 4-star wide receiver Ja’Kobi Lane and 4-star tight end Walker Lyons. 
Lane has been verbally committed to the Trojans since Aug. 26 but did not sign to play with the Trojans until NSD. Playing high school ball in Arizona, there were rumors Lane would flip his commitment to Arizona State once they hired Kenny Dillingham as their new head coach. However, Head Coach Lincoln Riley and the rest of the USC football staff were able to quell the rumors and land Lane’s signature.
USC has already signed 5-star wide receiver Zachariah Branch and 4-star wide receiver Makai Lemon, meaning Lane is the lowest-ranked of the three. However, this is still an important signature for the Trojans, as they have already lost junior wide receiver Jordan Addison to the NFL draft and four other wide receivers to the transfer portal.
Lyons, on the other hand, was never verbally committed to the Trojans until he signed his papers on Feb. 1. Originally, he verbally committed to Stanford on July 23 but decommitted on Nov. 28 after David Shaw resigned as head coach. 
USC did not land a commitment from a tight end in last year’s recruiting class, which makes Lyons’ commitment to the Trojans even more important. Lyons is a Latter-day Saint and will be making a mission trip during the 2023 season, meaning he will not suit up for the Trojans until the 2024 season. The Trojans will have to rely on tight end Lake McRee, who will be a redshirt sophomore next year, since Lyons will not be on the roster next season.
Since Lane had been committed to the Trojans before he signed, he was already included in USC’s recruiting score. But the addition of Lyons vaulted the Trojans up the recruiting rankings when he announced his signing. Before Lyons was locked in with USC, the Trojans ranked No. 15 in the high school recruiting rankings, but the tight end was able to bump the Trojans all the way up to No. 12, vaulting them over Penn State, Florida and Texas A&M.
Due to the lack of tight end depth behind McRee for next season, USC is still in the hunt for another top tight end. Five-star tight end Duce Robinson is the highest-ranked tight end in this recruiting cycle but has not yet made a decision about where he will be playing. That’s if he even plays football at the collegiate level.
Robinson has had a tricky recruitment since he is also a highly-rated baseball prospect. There are many factors that go into recruiting these days, including location, program, academics and NIL, and Robinson has that extra factor. He did not sign on NSD, meaning college coaches will have to wait even longer to find out where the tight end will end up playing.
Although the Trojans were able to sign two players on NSD, they missed out on a third to a Pac-12 opponent. 4-star cornerback Rodrick Pleasant went to high school at nearby Junipero Serra and was deciding between USC, Oregon, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Boston College, according to his personal Instagram. On Feb. 1, he announced he would be going to Oregon instead of staying close to home. Similar to Robinson, Pleasant is not only a football prospect but a track prospect as well, which may have factored into his decision. 
Pleasant is now the fifth high school prospect Oregon has poached from USC’s backyard in this recruiting cycle, joining 4-star defensive end Matayo Uiagalelei, 4-star cornerback Daylen Austin, 3-star athlete Solomon Davis and 3-star offensive lineman Lipe Moala.
This is a tough loss for the Trojans, not only because he is so local, but also because USC only has two defensive back commits from high school prospects this cycle. USC is still in contention for 4-star safety Warren Roberson, who is currently committed to TCU. However, he won’t  announce his commitment until Feb. 3 at the earliest because of an ice storm in Texas. He will be signing with TCU, USC or Texas, according to his personal Twitter. Signing Roberson would lower concerns about USC and its defensive back depth.
Even though USC’s high school recruiting class sits outside the top 10, their overall recruiting class, which includes transfer portal players and high school players, ranks at No. 8 in CFB, which is the highest in the Pac-12.
After spring ball, more players will enter the transfer portals and highly-ranked high school players, like Robinson, are still available. This will likely mean more movement in the rankings, but as things stand, Lincoln Riley and Co. brought in a top-10 class in their first full recruiting cycle at USC.

No. 2  USC will journey south this weekend to participate in the Triton Invitational where they could face many top-ranked opponents. No. 3 UCLA, No. 5 University of Hawai’i, No. 6 UC Irvine, No. 8 Long Beach State and No. 9 Fresno State are all going to be competing, and the Trojans could run into at least two of these teams on the way to the final.
USC has had success at this tournament in the past but lost last year in heartbreaking fashion in the final to UCLA on a game-winning goal with 23 seconds left. High standards are always expected of the seven-time national championship winners, so they’ll look to get back to that final this season. Head Coach Marko Pintaric said he knows the team will be ready for the ramp-up in tougher competition this weekend.
“Our standards are super high, before every season, we’re set to win the national championship,” said Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “This [tournament] is going to be a great test for the team where we will see top 10 ranked opponents and have back-to-back games on Saturday and they will be tested. This is our first real test and we’re looking forward to it, [the] expectation is to win the tournament.”
The season is still very young, but USC has seemed to sprint out of the gates so far. They won their first four games with relative ease, with not a single game finishing within single digits. This builds off their strong season only a year ago where they lost just one game to teams not named Stanford. If all goes according to plan for the Trojans, they could be playing four games in four days for the second week in a row. Redshirt sophomore 2-meter Hannah Meyer, who sat out last season with an injury, and the rest of the team are ready to take the tougher opponents head-on.
 “We’ve been hungry for some competition, we’ve trained since the day after Christmas during hell-month,” said Meyer in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “[We’re] really just trying to bond together, try to strengthen up and to play in the finals is kind of our end goal.”
The Trojans will start the weekend with a game against Concordia University, and if they win they’ll play the winner of No. 12 UC Santa Barbara and Indiana. Should the Trojans win their first few games, it could potentially set them up for a rematch against the Beach in the semifinals. USC took down Long Beach State 17-7 last Saturday in a game in which every Trojan seemed to be on the mark. In the game, nine different players for USC got on the score sheet. 
To start the season, Pintaric named redshirt senior driver Paige Hauschild and redshirt junior 2-meter Tilly Kearns captains. Both were named First-Team All-Americans last season and starred on their respective national teams in the Olympics. You could probably fill up a whole two pages listing just their accolades alone, but Pintaric said he chose them as captains because of the leaders they are outside the pool.
“They really stepped into being the coach’s voice in the locker room and really protectors of the team culture,” Pintaric said. “They provide help to younger players, to upperclassmen as well and they’re a great link between the coaching staff and the team.”
So far this season 20 different Trojans have scored a goal, a testament to their roster depth and the sheer amount of talent they have. USC was dominant last season and will only build on that considering 13 of their 16 players that were on the NCAA tournament roster returned. But the Trojans also have numerous talented new players coming in that will look to contribute to building on USC’s success. Talking to the players and coaches, you can tell that USC is as prepared and confident as ever.
“Every single day we treat practice like it’s the day before an NCAA championship, and it’s ‘we before me’ always,” Meyer said. “So having those things in the back of your mind and knowing that it is your second family and we’re all here for the same thing, and we remind ourselves of that every single day.”
The Trojans will head to UC San Diego this weekend and will take on Concordia in their first game of the Triton Invitational Friday at 1:20 p.m.
