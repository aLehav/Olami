Politico editor Carrie Budoff Brown spoke about objectivity and today’s political climate to an audience of nearly 60 in Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday. The event was moderated by Annenberg Media Center Director Christina Bellantoni.
“[Budoff Brown’s] hope is to foster an understanding of politics in the digital era,” Bellantoni said. “She has inspired students to be the best in [the journalism] field.” 
Budoff Brown discussed how Politico is different from other news outlets. Because of its focus on politics and policy, it hires journalists with varying political views but still expects unbiased reporting.  
Budoff Brown said it’s important for journalists to remain objective in their coverage because if one reporter shows bias, readers can lose trust in news.   
“We’re under a media microscope,” Budoff Brown said. “If one of us screws up, it looks like all of us screwed up.” 
Budoff Brown said that while journalists can have personal opinions on political issues,  they must remain objective to uphold their journalistic integrity.
“None of us are not biased,” Budoff Brown said. “I know that. I’m not asking people to curb all of their feelings, but I do want them to bring objectivity to [reporting].”  
Budoff Brown concluded by discussing her own values as a news reporter and how she ensures objectivity at Politico.
“I want everyone to look at the media and believe it’s a credible institution,” Budoff Brown said. “I’m trying to do my part, There’s a time and a place for expression [and] opinion, and I think if you’re a reporter at Politico you know what our jam is.” 
Shushanik Minasian, a graduate student studying journalism, said she enjoyed learning about Politico’s values and their expectations for journalists.
“I’ve been really into Politico for a while,” Minasian said, “I’m interested in agenda and learning what people are up to in editorial rooms … I’m interested in how [Politico] structures their view of how they should report.”

The Undergraduate Student Government proposed a bystander training resolution Tuesday that was passed in February under the previous Senate. 
Former  USG speaker pro tempore Matthew Crane presented the resolution to the Senate during the meeting. 
The senators passed the bill to renew their support of the resolution.
“Bringing this resolution back and passing it again is a signal to the administration that the student body … wants to take these steps to improve student safety on campus,” Crane said. “So much of what we do is symbolic.” 
The new resolution has garnered the support of Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services in addition to 53 other student organizations. 
The resolution calls for all recognized student organizations to send one representative to a mandatory annual bystander training session. The training sessions will focus on sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking. It also aims for the training to be “evidence-based” to teach the participants how to act in certain situations. 
The new resolution now includes graphs showing survey results for two pilot training sessions. According to the graphs, participants showed an increase in understanding of how to intervene certain situations, including sexual assault and questionable behavior, compared to before the training.
“Right now, it’s less about trying to say the student body wants this, it’s more of a chance to say it’s working,” Crane said. “We have existing momentum and we are trying to stay involved in this conversation.”
Currently, USG is working with RSVP to further plan and fund the initiative. The legislative body has allocated $5,000  and RSVP has allocated $15,000 for the initiative.
While evaluating USG’s budget for the next academic year, senators discussed the possibility of giving stipends to bystander training participants. 
It was later revealed in the meeting that the bylaws prevent USG from giving stipends to non-USG members. 
In a unanimous decision, the senators approved the budget for the training and decided to further review the possibility of 	paying participants in future senate meetings.
“There was a little bit of a mix up in the communication of essentially how we wanted money that given from the Senate to affect this program,” Sen. Emily Johnson said. “We came at a halt because we realized there was a contingency in the budget presentation that said [the money] cannot be used for student stipends.”
Since the money provided by USG will be used by RSVP at its own discretion, some senators are now looking for ways to ensure stipends can be paid toward the participants.
“We all are really in favor of this project,” Johnson said. “Regardless of how that money ends up being used, I’m just really excited about the fact that [the initiative] is moving forward.”

After scouring 31 million mortgage records, Aaron Glantz and USC alumnus Emmanuel Martinez from the Center for Investigative Reporting published a series titled, “Kept Out: How banks block people of color from homeownership,” which details housing discrimination across the United States and how American banks have been making home ownership virtually impossible for people of color in what is called “modern-day redlining.”
A little over a year later, the reporters were named as 2019 Pulitzer Prize finalists for Explanatory Reporting Monday.
“It’s still very fresh, and it still all feels very surreal,” said Martinez, a data reporter for Reveal, an investigative reporting podcast by the Center. 
Martinez received his master’s degree in journalism from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 2014. Martinez attended UC Irvine for his undergraduate degree and came to USC to pursue a career in journalism. It wasn’t until his second year that he realized he was interested in data reporting. 
“I created my own data curriculum because there was none at the time when I was going,” he said. “I found boot camps through investigative reporters and editors … I took two classes in [the] Viterbi [School of Engineering] … and just picked up more coding chops that way.” 
Martinez was a fellow at Google before becoming a data reporter at Reveal. Glantz first started working on “Kept Out” in 2015, and needed help combing through the large data sets.
“One of the main ways of building wealth in this country is home ownership, and so if [Aaron] was going to work on the story and try to do it, then he needed to answer that question through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data set, which lists nearly every mortgage application in the country for a given year,” Martinez said. “So then that’s when I came on.” 
Martinez said he wanted to work in investigative reporting to reflect the experiences of people of color.
“Oftentimes what I feel like happens with investigative reporting is that marginalized groups are often reported on … and it’s never really presented in a manner that they see themselves reflected,” Martinez said. “Especially for me as a person of color, that was really important for me to reach the black community and the POC community, because this is a story about their experiences and struggles.”

Nearly 50 students, alumni, community leaders and local residents marched from Jefferson Boulevard to Bovard Auditorium Tuesday to present a list of demands to University administrators. USC Forward — a coalition of unions, organizations and individuals calling for from USC accountability and transparency — organized the march, which marked the fourth day of the demonstration that started Saturday.
Stephe “Cue” Jn-Marie, a pastor from The Row Church at Skid Row, helped present the list of demands to University Chief of Staff Dennis Cornell along with several students and USC Forward leaders. 
“As you’re well aware, the University of Southern California has lost  its way,” the letter read. “The thousands of brilliant, hardworking and dedicated students, staff and faculty of this University have seen their work and reputations tarnished by the despicable actions of an elite few and the utter failure of leadership to address it.” 
The letter called for admission accessibility, housing affordability, community benefits, campus safety and labor rights. While the organizers hoped to give their demands directly to President-elect Carol Folt and Interim President Wanda Austin, both were unavailable. 
The protesters demanded a response from the University within 48 hours of Tuesday’s march. Jn-Marie said the organizers previously sent their demands to the University administration, but wanted to deliver them in person Tuesday to emphasize the need for change. 
“We want to make sure that they understand that we’re not going away and this is not a flyby night thing,” he said. “We want to talk to the president. We want to address some of these issues that we’re having in our communities because these issues have a reverberating effect on communities outside of USC’s jurisdiction.”  
Shany Ebadi, a junior majoring in political science, said she wants the University to outline specific steps it plans to take in working toward solutions for students, faculty, staff and local residents. She said these steps should suggest ways to have more affordable housing options and the ability to form unions among other demands rather than creating task forces and committees.
“They’ve definitely been having talks of where they want the University to go, that is evident,” Ebadi said. “The next step is to see exactly where our communities are going to fit into those plans and making sure that we are partners in those decisions.”  
Kameron Hurt, a senior majoring in international relations, said USC has been slow to make changes that could help students and surrounding community members because these demographics do not make profits for the University. Hurt said it is important for Folt to address the group’s demands as soon as she is appointed in July. 
“If by day one she is not addressing these issues the pressure needs to be there because she knew what she was stepping into in this role,” Hurt said. “She knew the history of scandals and the corrupt institution that she was placing herself in, so there’s no excuses.” 
Hurt said he also wants to see changes in the Board of Trustees, so that the Board comprises USC faculty, staff and students rather than businesspeople who are outsiders to campus issues. 
Jn-Marie said USC Forward will continue to push the University to make change. While he found the turnout at the march encouraging, he said the group and its partner organizations will reach out to more community members and rally a larger group of supporters if demands are not heard. 
“We haven’t really reached out to the community to really draw the crowds, so this is just a small turnout,” he said. “We wanted to give them an opportunity before we really [went] full scale and bring a large number of individuals here.” 
Ebadi said she encourages students who are angered by discrimination and other campus-wide issues to take action by participating in demonstrations like the march to have their demands heard by University officials. 
“There needs to be a systemic change,” she said. “It’s all about showing up for those who need it, showing up for those who need it because there’s power in numbers.”
Isa Uggetti contributed to this report.

Priam Residential College, one of the eight dormitories located at USC Village, will be renamed the William and Leslie McMorrow Residential College, following a donation from trustee William McMorrow and his wife Leslie. Though the building will officially adopt the new name in Fall 2019, exterior renovations to incorporate the name have already begun.
The name “Priam” —  selected after the last king of Troy during the Trojan War — served as a placeholder for the residential college.
William McMorrow, who is a member of the President’s Leadership Council and USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the Marshall School of Business in 1969 and 1970, respectively. 
Three of McMorrow’s siblings and his father attended USC. Leslie McMorrow, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara and Sophia University, is also the granddaughter of a USC graduate.
This is not the first USC-related name change at the hands of the McMorrow family. USC’s signature seven-year pre-college program, which supports over 1,000 students every year, was renamed the Leslie and William McMorrow Neighborhood Academic Initiative after the family gave the largest donation in the program’s history.
Last April, the University honored William McMorrow with the Asa V. Call Alumni Achievement Award -— the highest honor USC alumni can receive — during the 85th annual USC Alumni Awards. 
William McMorrow is also the CEO and chairman of Kennedy Wilson, a real estate ownership and service firm. McMorrow purchased the company in 1988, which now has 22 regional offices in the United States and Japan, along with over $5.8 billion worth of real estate investments.
According to residents in the building, the University began construction on the building last week. While the nameplate on the west side of the building has been fully changed, the nameplate on the south side is still in progress. 
“There was some construction that was pretty bothersome for that whole week,” said Lisabelle Panossian, a sophomore majoring in public relations and philosophy, politics and law. “That was really noisy.” 
Panossian said earplugs were taped onto every resident’s door in the building to counter the construction noise.
“It was just annoying having to deal with the noise,” said Annie Hong, a freshman majoring in psychology.

Two years ago, Isaac Franco was in the stands of the sold-out L.A. Memorial Coliseum watching USC face Texas. “Who knows, next year you could be cheering for me out there,” he said at one point during the game.
For someone who has never met Franco, this comment may sound smug. But those around him knew that he was on a meaningful journey. He would never say that out of arrogance, but simply out of confidence, with a sense of believing in himself and his capabilities. 
Regardless, he was right. The next time USC played Texas in 2018, Franco was no longer in the stands — he was on the field as a walk-on player.
But his journey there wasn’t so simple.
Franco started his college career playing lacrosse at Adams State University in Colorado. When he got there, he received a major wake-up call. Skill meant very little at the college level, and just being good at lacrosse wasn’t enough; he needed to be a well-rounded athlete.
Two years into his career at Adams State, the Franco family fell on hard times and Isaac had to come home to Los Angeles and work to support his family. As broken as he was to be leaving college, Franco took initiative and was hired at LA Fitness. After just one year, he became the club manager, and his franchise rose to No. 1 in sales nationwide. 
When Franco was able to return to school, he had to be dragged away. He was making serious money at LA Fitness, and it was mentally difficult for him to transition back to school. But it was important to his mom that he finish his degree because she hadn’t been able to finish hers. So he applied to USC as a human biology major with an emphasis on human performance. 
When he matriculated at USC and reconnected with high school friends Kellen Ware and David Benavides, the trio started working out together regularly. (Ware graduated from USC last fall and Benavides is a senior majoring in real estate development). 
This is when Franco’s story really begins. Ware and Benavides joked that they should try to walk on to the football team, but the minute they said it aloud, it was no longer a joke in Franco’s mind.
Ware, who is also Franco’s “big” in their fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, said he never saw Franco as a football player, but rather purely as a lacrosse guy. In high school, Franco was the punter and in one game even had negative punting yards, Ware said, laughing. Noone on their high school team would have thought that Franco would be a lineman at USC. But once Ware saw Franco was so dedicated to their dream, he and Benavides really started to buy in: Franco made them believe in themselves. 
Ware said the best part of his day was those three hours in the gym with Franco and Benavides. It was hard work, but the three shared a competitive spirit and were motivated by their friendship. 
For the next six months, Franco spent three hours a day in the weight room. He put on 35 pounds. He had played football in high school, but lacrosse had always been his focus, so he used his savings to hire a coach to help him with fieldwork. He would sneak into the McKay Center and find ways to “coincidentally” run into then-head strength and conditioning coach Ivan Lewis. Franco did all this while commuting to campus from home every day. After his time away from school, he needed something to keep him mentally grounded at USC, and this was it.
But then, he was cut in the final round of tryouts his junior year. 
However, Franco left thinking not about what he did wrong, but what he could do better next time. He told himself that if he tried one more time, he would make it.
“I don’t believe in embarrassing myself. What’s the worst that happens? I don’t make it. Nobody was going to put us on Sports Center and laugh at us,” he said. “I didn’t want to be here in 20 years and think, ‘I could’ve tried out for football but didn’t.’ I’d rather make the team and not play a single down than not try at all.”
His lofty aspirations were no secret, either. He told people about it on purpose because he wanted them to hold him accountable. The fact that everyone who knew him also knew about this goal provided extra pressure that he thrived under.
But at the end of the day, Franco wasn’t pursuing football for anyone but himself. He told himself he was going to do it, so he had to go through with it. He had to be relentless, put in the hours and make the sacrifices. Franco said that a true athlete has to be built a certain way, that they have a quality of always giving their all and an inherent drive to be at the top.
When another year of training came, Franco came down with bronchitis the day before tryouts. But true to form, he didn’t dwell on that. In fact, he was happy he had bronchitis. His journey to get this far had been so hard, the final test should be difficult, too. 
When he made the team, that was only the beginning for Franco. 
“I took a second to embrace it, but my intention was never to be able to say I played USC football,” he said. “That’s a cool perk, but I wanted to accomplish something.”
That was when the real work started. He gave it his best every day, even approaching senior linebacker Porter Gustin and asking if he could join in on his famous midnight workouts with other starters. He learned as much as he could and tried to be a good teammate, making the people around him better. 
It was the greatest year of his life, Franco said, even though playing for USC last season was difficult for him. He suffered a torn labrum and a broken toe, which hampered his ability to compete. In the end, he didn’t get the playing time he had wanted, which he says wasn’t unfair at all, that sometimes your best just isn’t good enough.
On Senior Night at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum, Franco chose his parents, Ware and Benavides to appear on the field with him for the pre-game ceremony. He said he is forever indebted to his two friends because without their support, he never could have achieved his dream. Sometimes they didn’t want to work out and stick to the plan as much as Franco did, but they still showed up to the gym every day for their friend because they knew it was important to him. 
When the 2018 season ended that night with a loss to Notre Dame, Franco approached head coach Clay Helton to shake his hand and thank him for the opportunity to play in Cardinal and Gold. He also apologized for not being able to contribute more and help on the field because he felt he had let himself and his teammates down.
But Helton’s response epitomizes the value of the journey for Franco.
“No,” the head coach said. “The stuff you did in practice, the stuff you brought every day … for that, you’ll always be a Trojan.”
Franco said Helton probably doesn’t even remember the conversation, but that his words meant a lot. 
Overall, Franco said all his sacrifices were worth it. He didn’t get too caught up in the pageantry of the sport — he just cared about football, but he cannot explain the feeling of running out the tunnel onto the Coliseum field.
From dropping out of college to being cut from the team the first time he tried out, Franco’s journey to living out his dream was long and hard but he gave his all every single day.
“It’s funny going to a school with the motto ‘Fight On,’” Franco said. “Everything I’ve done was just another challenge, and that made me the person I am today.”

No. 2 USC will compete in two final regular season games at home against Grand Canyon University and Cal Poly on Thursday. USC will celebrate its seniors while wrapping up a successful season as it heads into the Pac-12 tournament.
The Trojans currently hold a six-game winning streak after two dominant performances last Thursday. They swept Long Beach State and Pepperdine by commanding scores of 5-0 and 4-1, respectively. These victories were crucial as USC outplayed two top 10-ranked opponents.
The seniors’ experience will be important for the team on Senior Day as they are coming off of strong showcases at the top three spots against the Waves and 49ers. Seniors Abril Bustamante, Terese Cannon and Alexandra Poletto were each part of duos that went undefeated in both matchups last Thursday.
“As a team, we know that we are nearing the end of our season,” Cannon said. “We fought really hard and knew that these were some of the last chances we had to perfect our game.”
The Trojans will face No. 15 Grand Canyon University at 1 p.m. Thursday. GCU currently holds a winning streak of its own, having defeated its last four opponents. The Antelopes have asserted themselves as a strong team with these victories, even though all their opponents were unranked. Although this will be the first time the Trojans duel GCU this year, USC swept them in three matchups last year.
Cal Poly may prove to be a more significant challenge. The Mustangs are currently the seventh-ranked team in the nation and are coming off of a split in their most recent games last Saturday. The Mustangs fell to Pepperdine but defeated Cal, bringing their overall record to 19-8. This will also be the first time USC faces the Mustangs this year, and the Trojans defeated them in a close 3-2 finish when they met last season.
Following these final matchups, USC will remain at home to host the Pac-12 Championship at Merle Norman Stadium from April 25 to 27. The Trojans hope to avenge last year’s loss in the finals to UCLA and reclaim the title that they held for the two previous years.
“We feel really good [going into championship season],” Bustamante said. “We know that we can beat anyone.”

As a little kid, it was hard for me to comprehend that professional athletes were just normal people with athletic abilities. Growing up, I thought athletes were bigger than life and had everything figured out. Everyone loved them, they had tons of money and they were living the dream every day. 
As I’m getting older and starting to understand the sports world a bit more, it’s becoming more clear to me that being a professional athlete isn’t as glamorous as I had once thought. 
Last week, Stadium released a video on YouTube from 2016 of the moment star NBA player Derrick Rose got traded to the New York Knicks from his hometown team, the Chicago Bulls. It was one of the most heartbreaking and eye-opening moments in sports I’ve witnessed in a while. 
Rose was a star player coming out of college and carried his organization with class before he was plagued by injuries. In 2011, he was the youngest player to ever win the league’s Most Valuable Player award.
At the beginning of the video, Rose was getting interviewed about the trade rumors involving him and the New York Knicks. He simply brushed off the question as if nothing was going to happen. 
Minutes later, on a phone call with his agent, Rose was taped having a breakdown when he found out he would be traded to the Knicks.
“In the business and in my life period, there always be twists and turns like this,” Rose said in an interview after the phone call. “I don’t know how to feel right now. I’m anxious, shocked. That shit made me who I am.”
Despite being the face of the Bulls franchise and giving everything he had to the organization for eight seasons, Rose was traded.
For anyone in their mid-20s, having to suddenly pack your bags and leave can be intimidating. Professional athletes have to live in constant fear that they may be traded and have to uproot themselves and their families in an instant. They have no control over their lives.
Rose is the perfect example of this constant fear. Even a player who was loved by his city and wore the colors with honor was blindsided by the trade and helpless to stop it. 
Yes, it’s part of the business, and yes, many of these players make millions of dollars in the process. But as former baseball player Curt Flood said, “A well-paid slave is, nonetheless, a slave.”
These athletes are not in control of their own lives.
That’s why it is so important that players do not take discounts when signing a new deal during free agency. Ultimately, professional sports is a business, and if your team won’t show you any loyalty (and it shouldn’t be expected to), then there should be no obligation for players to show any loyalty to the franchise and take less money. Players have to think about themselves and their families first, because there is nothing stopping their team from shipping them off somewhere else if something doesn’t work.
Moreover, outside of politics, sports and maybe journalism, there aren’t many other professions where random people just call you out for your shortcomings and express pure and utter disdain toward you despite the fact that you’ve done absolutely nothing to them. 
It’s not easy dealing with constant criticism on a  daily basis, and athletes have to deal with it every day. Sometimes it’s for trivial things like playing for a rival team but other times, players get ridiculed because they might have had a bad performance.
Usually, teams have a scapegoat for fans to ridicule when a performance doesn’t go their way. When fans can’t pinpoint what went wrong in their team’s performance, they’ll often settle on the usual suspect even if that player didn’t have a bad game. It’s unfortunate, but it’s the reality.
Imagine having to go on social media every day of your life and just see fans hating on you just because of your job or because you’re going through a slump. It takes a toll on a player’s mental health. 
Watching Rose suffer a mental breakdown after he was traded really put the life of a professional athlete into perspective.  These players are regular young people who are vulnerable to the outside world — not superheroes with no emotions.

USC traveled across the country to face No. 20 Stony Brook in an out-of-conference game late in the season and fell 10-12, bringing USC to a 13-3 record just one game before the end of the regular season. 
Stony Brook started off the game strong, scoring 4 quick goals within the first five minutes of play, with assists from Stony Brook senior attacker Sara Moeller on each. In the first half, all 6 of the Seawolves’ goals were assisted. 
USC’s defense seemed to have no means of stopping Stony Brook’s attack. Stony Brook looked like the better team offensively, with USC only getting one shot off before they found themselves in a 0-4 hole.
Senior attacker Emily Concialdi finally put the Trojans on the board with just under 18 minutes left in the first half, but Stony Brook refused to relinquish their momentum. The Seawolves scored 2 more goals to extend the first half lead to 5. 
In the final stretch of the first half, USC methodically brought themselves back into the game. The Trojans were down 1-6 when Concialdi scored her second goal of the game off a free position. USC rattled off 5 unanswered goals in under seven minutes. 
A variety of Trojans got in on the scoring during this comeback. Redshirt junior attacker Amanda Flayhan scored off of freshman midfielder Erin Bakes’ assist. 
USC opened the second half strong, executing perfectly on a play that ended with this season’s points leader, sophomore midfielder Kelsey Huff, scoring a quick goal right off of the first draw in the second half. 
Despite this momentum, Stony Brook fought back. After USC went up by 1 goal, the Seawolves responded with 4 consecutive scores. 
Sophomore goalie Riley Hertford had six saves on the day. Although it was not her best statistical game, she came up big in crucial moments. Hertford ultimately made the saves and caused the turnovers needed to give her offense an opportunity to tie the game. 
A Concialdi free position goal started yet another scoring run for USC when sophomore attacker Sophia Donovan scored her first goal of the day.
With two minutes remaining in the game, Huff brought USC within one point with a shot that hit the upper right corner and shook the net. 
USC lost the ensuing draw control, and Stony Brook called a timeout to discuss how they wanted to run the clock down. Coming out of the timeout, Stony Brook junior midfielder Ally Kennedy caught Hertford out of the goal, ran around two USC defenders and put Stony Brook back up by 2. 
This was the final score of the game as USC was unable to get another shot off.
Statistically, the game was even, with USC having a 14-9 advantage on the draw. The only category Stony Brook had an advantage in was 11 saves to USC’s six.  
Despite opportunities down the stretch to tie the game, USC’s offense couldn’t execute. Throughout the season, especially in games against ranked teams, the offense has failed to produce consistently. 
In both this game and the loss to Colorado, USC’s offense struggled early placing the team in comeback mode the whole game. 
This game marked the first time USC allowed an opponent to score over 10 goals since facing Virginia Tech in early March. 
The Trojans will have to regroup before Saturday when they host Arizona State in their last match before the Pac-12 tournament.

Winter Valent wears almost exclusively black, with the exception of an occasional camouflage military jacket. He’s tall and skinny, with icy white hair that offsets his greyish-blue eyes. His given name matches his appearance. 
Valent, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, founded Spoiled Threads — a clothing brand that offers grunge-style, USC-themed clothing — during his first year at USC. The company was born out of Valent’s own struggles. 
“I’ve really been an outcast all of my life,” Valent said. “When I transferred to USC, I really didn’t fit that carbon-copy style of the University bookstore. It’s blocky letters, it’s gold and cardinal and I’ve never been a fan of that stuff.” 
Valent was taking a course called “The Management of New Enterprises” taught by professor Patrick Henry when he decided to do something about what he saw as a lack of diversity in USC apparel. 
“I really feel like that culmination of being socially isolated and not fitting in was the thing that really clicked in my head and said, ‘Hey, let’s change this,’” Valent said. “Let’s create a fashion line for students that really don’t feel comfortable, for the misfits, the outcasts, and that can … say, ‘Hey, we’re at this university as well. We can give as much pride as you can, we just do it in a different way.’” 
Valent initially intended to start the company as a luxury hoodie brand. However, he soon realized the impact an alternative option to bookstore clothing would have on campus. 
After conducting hundreds of customer discovery interviews, Valent’s hypothesis proved true. He wasn’t alone in his desire to wear USC-branded clothing, and he certainly wasn’t the only one with a distaste for the bookstore’s merchandise offerings. 
“We figured out that this is super viable,” Valent said. “This is something that’s needed, and it’s more than just me. It’s the whole community that’s not being seen here.” 
Valent’s project was also validated in class. Spoiled Threads was crowned the winner of the course’s best new venture competition. 
The company currently sells sweatshirts and hoodies on its ecommerce site. Past offerings have also included camouflage and black denim jackets. 
All of Spoiled Threads’ products prominently display cheeky USC sayings. Namesake apparel features the phrase “University of Spoiled Children.” Spoiled Threads’ most recent line, inspired by the recent college admissions scandal, reads “University of Scandals and Corruption” and “SCANDAL.” 
From the start, Valent has financed Spoiled Threads himself without having to take in any outside investments. The summer after taking Henry’s class, Valent worked at a fast food restaurant to save up cash for his business.
The bootstrapped company is already profitable, having brought in over $1,000 in revenue in 2019.
Valent is also using Spoiled Threads for a semester-long project in his capstone entrepreneurship course taught by professor Albert Napoli. Napoli, who has been Valent’s mentor and adviser to Spoiled Threads this semester, commended his work ethic.  
“Winter is the type of founder that a mentor wants,” Napoli said. “He’s smart, he’s coachable, he’s not afraid to do the hard work.”
Napoli’s course emphasizes the critical need for a company to have a unique competitive advantage. He said that Spoiled Threads’ advantage is that it doesn’t try to be like any other University merchandise brand. 
“They have found a niche, and that niche is basically embodied in Winter,” Napoli said. “It’s someone who’s not your typical USC student, but someone who is alternative in their look, in their style and wants to be supportive of their University.” 
Valent has received help from his friend and former roommate Bryce Covelli, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration. Covelli has been involved with the project since its early days, working behind the scenes on strategy and marketing initiatives. He also helps Valent with designs and customer discovery. 
Covelli said he’s noticed immense growth in Valent’s leadership skills. 
“He’ll tell you and admit that he’s usually not the best at talking to people and interacting with people and giving presentations,” Covelli said. “Over time, the biggest improvement I’ve seen, at least, is probably just interacting with people on a day-to-day basis regarding the brand.” 
Valent is aware of his personal growth. 
“Day one, I was literally shaking like I was in an earthquake because I really wasn’t ready for this position,” Valent said. “Over the semester, I’ve really harnessed these reigns and figured out how to be a leader in this company, how to build myself up, how to be a team player and actually just make sure that the product I deliver is high quality and it delivers a story.” 
Spoiled Threads made it to the top 16 in the USC Marshall New Venture Seed Competition in which hundreds of start-ups founded by either USC students or alumni vie for $85,000 in funding. 
Valent has spent the past six Saturday mornings in customer discovery sessions taught by the Greif Center. Spoiled Threads placed seventh at the end of the six weeks, one spot away from earning a slot in the final round.
Valent aspires to continue pursuing Spoiled Threads for the foreseeable future. After a grueling fall semester of exclusively engineering courses, he is relieved to find himself back in a business class. 
“Last semester, it got to a point where I was sleeping maybe three days a week and just pulling all-nighters consistently,” Valent said. “It just got to a point on both my physical and mental health where I realized I was giving it my all, and I was fully capable of doing it, it just wasn’t for me.” 
He hopes to transfer from Viterbi to Marshall to pursue his true passion — entrepreneurship. 
While biomedical engineering is no longer in the cards for Valent here at USC, he is by no means giving up on the health care industry. 
“An end goal for me is to have a firm that creates prosthetic arms and prosthetic limbs and hearts for people, because a lot of times they never have the chance to have an arm or a limb,” Valent said. 
Valent said he strives to provide people with the tools they need but were not necessarily born with. 
“My core is giving people a chance that they were never given,” Valent said. “That’s always driven me, whether it’s been in medical devices [or fashion].”
