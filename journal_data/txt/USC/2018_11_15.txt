With rivalry week ramping up, the Trojans took the field to focus on discipline and tempo on Wednesday. 
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Matt Fink saw some action on Wednesday, splitting non-contact reps with redshirt freshman quarterback Jack Sears, but head coach Clay Helton made it clear that there is only one starting quarterback for USC.
“We’re fortunate to have three great quarterbacks, but JT is the starter,” Helton said. “Last week’s stall was not the act of the quarterback.”
The emphasis for the offense this week will be to sustain full drives, converting third downs in order to keep the UCLA offense off the field, and the team drilled third down situations throughout practice. The Trojans have just a 38 percent rate of effectiveness converting on third down so far this season, a statistic that barely ranks in the top 100 teams of the country. 
This inability to close third downs has forced the team to rely instead on breaking off large plays rather than building plays that march from one end of the field to the other. Although the team has slightly improved as the season progressed, Helton stressed that it will be vital for his team to find its rhythm on third down to last through all four quarters in the Rose Bowl.
In the dependably competitive atmosphere of the crosstown rivalry game, Helton is also emphasizing the importance of cool heads throughout every level of his team. Against Cal, the Trojans suffered a critical penalty when senior cornerback Iman Marshall jawed at the Cal sidelines after an incomplete pass. Instead of forcing Cal to kick the ball away on fourth down, the penalty gave the Bears the first down necessary to pull out the win.
“On Monday, I addressed the team and apologized for my actions,” Marshall said. “That did have an effect on the game.”
Helton said that he was proud of Marshall. But apologies won’t be enough when the team faces UCLA; discipline will be necessary. 
“I don’t know what was said,” Helton said of the confrontation. “Usually it’s the second guy who gets caught. They need to learn that.”

After splitting weekend home matchups against Washington and Washington State, the No. 14 USC women’s volleyball team will battle No. 24 Arizona and Arizona State over the weekend. 
Arizona enters play on Friday in sixth place in the Pac-12, carrying a 8-8 record in the conference and a 19-9 record overall. The Trojans defeated the Wildcats at home on Oct. 14, 3-1. 
Arizona is led by senior outside hitter Kendra Dahlke with 4.95 kills per set on the season. The Wildcats bring a .238 hitting percentage into Friday’s matchup.
USC found success against Arizona State on Oct. 12, coming out on top with a five-set victory over the Sun Devils. Head coach Brent Crouch said the Trojans will take a similar game plan heading into Sunday’s tilt.  
 “Arizona State’s really good at hitting high hands and whacking balls off hands out of bounds really far,” Crouch said. “We had to make some adjustments when we played them the last time, shifting our defense back a little bit, and we’ll probably have to do that again.” 
Senior outside hitter Alyse Ford leads the Sun Devils with 3.14 kills per set.
Despite the fact that the Sun Devils are unranked and well behind the Trojans in the Pac-12 standings, Crouch sees some strengths in Arizona State. Still, he seemed confident about the Trojans’ ability to pick up the win.
“[ASU is] a good serving team and they’re a good defensive team,” Crouch said. “But our offense is better than their defense.” 
USC had a .256 hitting percentage against the Sun Devils in October. 
The Women of Troy were missing three starters in both games last weekend, and Crouch said the team is still unsure of their status heading into the road trip.
Crouch will try to balance resting his players with making sure they come out victorious in the last few games as the season winds down.
“It’s going to be tough because we have four matches in seven days to end the season, and we’re just going to have to not practice very much,” Crouch said. “It’s just the way it is — you have to cut hours back. Being healthy is more important than anything else going into the tournament.”
USC will enter the weekend with an 11-5 conference record and only a one game lead on second place in the Pac-12. Oregon and Washington State both currently stand at 10-6, and Washington is just two games back at 9-7. Crouch thinks this alone should provide motivation for his players to bring their A-game into Arizona.
The head coach is not worried about the possibility that the Trojans take their opponents lightly due to their previous success against the two schools. 
“I don’t think that’s an issue,” Crouch said. “[The team] knows everyone in the Pac-12 could beat anyone on any given day, and the motivation for finishing strong in the Pac-12 and getting a good seed in the tournament is enough.”
The weekend road trip will be USC’s last of the season, as their following two games are next week at home against Utah Wednesday and at UCLA on Friday. The Trojans have fared well on the road thus far, sporting a 7-3 record in away contests compared to 9-3 at the Galen Center. 
As Crouch stressed, the Trojans will look to close in on the No. 2 seed for the Pac-12 tournament. Two wins this weekend would increase USC’s already high chances of that second spot, as next week’s schedule features two favorable matchups against Utah and UCLA.
Friday’s game will begin at 5 p.m. in Tuscon, Arizona. Sunday’s match will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be televised on Pac-12 Network.

The last 48 hours have been a whirlwind for Los Angeles football fans, as the NFL made a startling announcement: The Rams’ Monday night game against the Chiefs, previously scheduled to take place in Mexico City, has been moved back home to the Coliseum.
The game was an important step in the NFL’s expansion program, aimed at bringing the game of football to other countries in hopes of expanding its fanbase. But less than a week before the blockbuster game, troubling pictures emerged of Estadio Azteca, the host site for the matchup. The grass was torn up, more brown than green, a foreboding expanse of lumpy turf. 
From a picture, it was clear that the stadium wasn’t safe for play, and most likely wouldn’t be by Monday night. The NFL took less than 24 hours to announce its decision to move the game back to the Coliseum, prompting outcry from fans in both countries who had already booked tickets, flights and hotel rooms.
It was an odd, perplexing series of events for a variety of reasons. Estadio Azteca is one of the finest fields in Mexico, hosting the beloved Club América and the Mexican national team alike. Soccer fields are typically kept in pristine condition, even finer than American football fields, with the grass carefully manicured to allow the ball to roll smoothly.
But an unexpectedly rainy season and a packed calendar of games left the field muddy and torn up. The NFL didn’t have any other choice but to move the game back to Los Angeles; but in doing so, it lost a valuable expansion opportunity.
The NFL has been working to expand outside of the United States for a while now. The league is looking to follow the lead of the NBA, which has perfected this type of effort, especially with its focus on breaking into Asia. NBA stars tour in the off season, meeting fans and putting on exhibitions, and the league has made sure that game broadcasts are easily accessible around the world. 
As a result, Stephen Curry jerseys sell out in China and Italy as well as in the U.S. The NBA is a global brand; and both casual and fervent fans are capable of following and representing their teams from anywhere. 
What’s the appeal of a widespread reach? Money — plain and simple. The NBA recognized that untapped markets in places such as India and China, with large masses of potential fans existing in areas with little to no major sports industries, could supply a boon of revenue if properly marketed.
The NFL is smart to do the same, but its approach has been less successful in years past. Games played in London went over well, especially with expat fans. But the NFL hasn’t been able to find a way to crack into overseas markets in the same way that the NBA has. Monday’s game in Mexico was meant to continue remedying this issue, potentially exciting a previously undervalued Mexican market by giving it a chance to see a high-caliber L.A. team take on Kansas City in what is sure to be a thrilling shootout.
It’s important to understand, then, what the rescheduled game means for the NFL. Sure, there are American fans who took vacation days and bought plane tickets to travel and see their favorite team, and those people have plenty to be angry about as they lose money and time that they otherwise could have spent elsewhere.
But the fans who truly miss out are the ones who might not exist because of this rescheduled game. Perhaps this is a melodramatic statement, but it’s also the truth of the matter. Foreign soil football games are meant, first and foremost, to support expansion efforts for the NFL. In this, the league failed before it even kicked off the game. 
The emphasis of expansion isn’t in moving teams to other countries, but in captivating fans in outside markets. Before Monday, only one game had been played in Mexico — a 2005 matchup between the Arizona Cardinals and the San Francisco 49ers in the league’s first year of play outside of the U.S. It was meant to light a fire in fans, to draw in new supporters and pave the way for creating a completely new fanbase for the NFL.
Instead, the league will have to measure its losses and begin to plan again. But in striking deals and making arrangements for the future, the NFL must make sure to prioritize Mexico, in the hopes of soothing whatever hurt this week’s debacle created.

Senior forward Bennie Boatwright made his return from injury Wednesday night as the USC men’s basketball team cruised to a solid bounceback victory over the visiting Stetson Hatters 95-59.
USC has to be pleased about Boatwright’s strong season debut. Boatwright, who has dealt with a rash of injuries throughout his career, is the Trojans’ captain, and showed his unique blend of big man and shooter. He finished with 16 points and four 3-pointers in just 18 minutes. 
Boatwright spoke humbly about his return and what he learned from sitting on the sidelines. 
“Mentally, I’m going to stay even-keeled,” said Boatwright. “That’s going to be important, being a leader. Struggle helps you a lot mentally. When you go through pains, you gotta find a way to get through it… I feel like that’s what I overcame to come back from this injury.” 
Head coach Andy Enfield praised Boatwright for settling in smoothly as he came off the bench.
“He came in, shared the ball, and made some good plays for his teammates … we got him going in the second half,” Enfield said. “We need his perimeter shooting, his size, his experience, and it just looked like he was in total control when he played.”
The energy from their leader’s return — coupled with the fact that USC simply was more athletic — got the Trojans out and running from the start, as they raced to a 30-7 lead and never looked back. Though the Trojans struggled from deep outside of Boatwright’s shooting, finishing 7-of-23 as a whole, they showed much more defensive composure and discipline with only 11 team fouls after 3 players fouled out in the loss against Vanderbilt Sunday. 
However, strong transition game starts with defense; USC proved itself by limiting Stetson to 31 percent shooting from the field, including an 18 percent mark from three. Only sophomore guard Christiaan Jones scored in double-digits for the Hatters, as they simple could not get into a rhythm and keep up with USC’s uptempo pace. 
Junior big man Nick Rakocevic had 16 points and 12 rebounds, his third straight double-double to open the season, while limiting Stetson’s leading scorer, junior forward Ricardo Lynch, to just 3 points. Now averaging 17.7 and 15.3 on the year, Rakocevic and Boatwright have the makings of a formidable inside-out duo in the frontcourt that could carry the team all season.
“Nick played another good game,” Enfield said. “Had his typical double-double — that’s what we call him now, the double-double man… he’s rebounded at a high level, tips a lot of balls, he’s one of the best offensive rebounders you’ll see anywhere and we’re really proud of his development.”
It was a night of firsts for young players. Freshman guard Elijah Weaver scored 9 points in his college debut, and freshman guard Kevin Porter made his first start against the Hatters, with a line of 12 points and three assists. 
“He’s a great passer, he’s very athletic, he shares the ball and he sees the floor,” Enfield said of Weaver. “He’s a very unique talent with his court vision, like a quarterback on a football team.”
Porter also spoke confidently about Enfield’s simple, yet effective game plan. 
“Just coming into the game and wanting to start out fast, that’s what we did,” Porter said. “We just had to maintain it. It’s just basketball, we’ve been doing this all our lives, up to this point… you see the results.”
Now 2-1 on the season, USC will host Cal State Bakersfield Sunday at 4 p.m. at the Galen Center. 
Injury update 
Sophomore forward Charles O’Bannon Jr. will be out for four weeks after undergoing surgery on his finger, according to Enfield.

JT Daniels had a realization on the first day of fall camp: Everyone belongs here. 
“I played at a great high school against great competition, but when you’re in college, everyone belongs,” the freshman quarterback said. “There’s nobody that’s a scrub. The game moves faster, everyone is a lot bigger, everyone’s a lot stronger. Nobody sucks anymore.”
Daniels had a seemingly smooth high school football career. He left Mater Dei High School a year early, following an undefeated season and a state title. Daniels came to USC at an opportune time, as Sam Darnold declared for the NFL Draft, leaving the quarterback position vacant.
But collegiate success wasn’t ensured following his high school career.
Before Daniels even took a collegiate snap, before he was declared the starting quarterback, the expectations couldn’t have been set higher for the 18-year-old freshman.
“Go ahead and believe the hype,” read a headline in the Los Angeles Times on Aug. 11. “The next great USC QB shouldn’t even be in college,” wrote The Ringer six days later. And “The JT Daniels hype machine in full gear,” Inside USC said on May 4. 
Those headlines overwhelmed the collegiate football world leading up to the 2018 season. 
At USC, Daniels was touted as the savior who would fill Darnold’s shoes. But the expectations and narratives that flooded college football were never things that Daniels considered.
“As much as you would think those expectations would weigh down on someone, I don’t care one bit about those expectations,” Daniels said. “[The senior leaders on the team] really helped to teach me that that stuff doesn’t matter. You get in here and work and do your best to be a part of this team. All I’m worried about is doing my job for the team.”
Young quarterbacks, especially those as young as the 18-year-old Daniels, are often faced with a catch-22 situation: They are expected to be leaders on the field, despite having the least seniority. Daniels recognized this dilemma and understood that vocal leadership would be counter-productive to the team. Instead, he opted to lead by example.
“I don’t think it would be successful for me to walk in here and start telling people what to do,” Daniels said. “It was more about always being in the right situation for myself and doing the right thing on and off the field, and guys will gravitate towards that.”
But when the Trojans lost several games they were projected to win, it led many to question if the attention was too much for the young passer.
“You’re not going to go undefeated in college and win every game in the league,” Daniels said. “That’s not the reality of the game.”
Daniels realized that sentiment early in the season after suffering his first loss in over a year to Stanford on Sept. 8 and a brutal 37-14 defeat at the hands of Texas a week later. The season didn’t get any easier from there. The Trojans face UCLA at the Rose Bowl on Saturday with a 5-5 record, desperate for a win in one of their final two games to become bowl eligible. They are on pace for their worst season since the beginning of the Pete Carroll era in 2001.
Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Despite the tumultuous season, Daniels’ father, Steve, thinks his son is thriving under the pressure.
“I think he is handling [the losses] really well,” Steve said. “Frankly the challenges that are there are just making him work harder … Seeing him go after his goals and see them not come as easily, kind of just reiterates who he is. Because he doesn’t care about individual awards, but he wants his team to be as good as it can possibly be.” 
The headlines didn’t stop at Daniels’ on-field performance. Months before the season opener, Bleacher Report published an article that described Daniels adopting Buddhism, a claim that both Daniels and his parents refuted. 
In reality, Daniels just sees worth in some Buddhist teachings, according to his father. Steve compared it to his son’s football training, how learning techniques from former NFL quarterback Jordan Palmer doesn’t mean Daniels worships Jordan Palmer. 
“He just finds things that work, and he uses them,” Steve said.
Daniels frequently watches content from social media influencers focused on self-improvement. One of his favorite channels is “Impact Theory,” founded by Tom Bilyeu, one of Daniels’ life role models. The channel focuses on steps to success to expanding one’s mind. 
“It’s a motivational thing,” Daniels said.
This explains Daniels’ love for the base principles of Buddhism. While he does not consider himself Buddhist, he has adapted some of the principles of detachment and balance into his life after learning about them in a high school class. 
The expansion of his mind is a part of the greater picture of Daniels’ perseverance and obsession with fully completing whatever it is he sets his mind to.
“For his whole life, whatever he was into he would just dive into it, live it, breathe it, own it and then move onto the next thing,” said his mother, Alison. “He needs to master whatever it is he is into.”
After completing a perfect 2017 season at Mater Dei, convincingly defeating St. John Bosco in the state championship game and winning a slew of awards, there wasn’t much left for Daniels to achieve at the high school level. It was time to “move onto the next thing.” Steve said that Daniels would likely have not left high school if there was unfinished business. 
“He wanted so desperately to be a part of the turnaround at Mater Dei. Not that it’s not a great program, [it] just hasn’t won a championship since 1999,” Steve said. “So had [Mater Dei] not won, he might have said, ‘Dad, I don’t care how ready I am. We have to finish what we started.’”
With two games remaining in the 2018 regular season, Daniels looks to begin that process in college: Reconciling with what has been a far below average season at USC and finishing what he has started in the coming years. 
“You’re going to lose some. You’re going to win some,” Daniels said “It’s just about learning and coming back from it.”

On a sweltering Friday afternoon, people line up on 108th Street in Watts. The line comprises a kaleidoscope of races and nationalities, ranging from locals to tourists. The street buzzes with energy as the colorful All Flavor No Grease truck begins to waft the smell of seasoned meat throughout the neighborhood. Owner Keith Garrett hasn’t even opened yet, but people are already eager to get their hands on an All Flavor No Grease quesadilla.
The truck begins to take orders, doling out numbers with a rare friendliness. The menu is limited to three Mexican American staples: tacos, burritos and quesadillas. As opposed to a Mexican taco truck that would be bursting with differents cuts of pork and beef, the franchise also limits itself to three types of meat: chicken, beef and shrimp. Although the menu is limited, every item has been perfected to an All Flavor No Grease standard that makes it incomparable to that of more traditional taco trucks.
The most popular item, by far, is the quesadilla. Robust seasoned meat (if desired) is blanketed with ample amounts of blended cheese; the tortilla is toasted just enough to be crispy and smothered with white, green and red sauces. Served in a styrofoam box with a fork and knife, it looks more like lasagna than a quesadilla. But among the sharpness of the cheese, the richness of the meat and the tangy acidity of the pico de gallo, it is easily one of the best quesadillas in Los Angeles.
All Flavor No Grease is powered by Garrett, a lively personality who is equal parts playful and grateful. His Instagram is filled with pictures of dripping quesadillas, tacos and burritos, spotted with videos in which he gives advice. Despite a few hiccups along the way, All Flavor No Grease is a growing enterprise, with a two-truck expansion and frequent pop-ups in restaurants. 
Garrett, or “Chef Ocho,” grew up on 108th Street. On many days, the truck is parked outside of his family’s own house. Neighbors will sit outside and enjoy the food, watching the passersby visiting the food truck. But it isn’t always placid — gang violence still shakes the neighborhood from time to time. One of All Flavor No Grease’s own employees, Travione Mason, was shot and killed in 2015 while working at a house party in South L.A. But occasional violence does not deter All Flavor No Grease — the truck optimistrically hopes to resolve differences through food. 
All Flavor No Grease began as a small stand outside Garrett’s home. After months of selling candy and snacks, Garrett began to make tacos by a friend’s suggestion. From there, the enterprise grew into a massive front yard barbecue, serving signature dishes under a blue E-Z Up. It was much more lucrative than snacks and other goods, and for the most part, safer. To this day, All Flavor No Grease occasionally gets reprimanded for obstructing traffic on 108th Street, and has been shut down for its uncontrollable popularity. With food trucks, police interference is much less frequent, giving Chef Ocho some space to sell his quesadillas.
108th Street isn’t always peaceful, but the peace is growing. All Flavor No Grease has become a place of neutrality for South L.A. gangs, proving the powers of a flavorful quesadilla. The food truck continues to operate and illuminate Watts to crowds of people who would otherwise be uncomfortable in the area. But with a community as bright as Watts and a chef as happy as Garrett, it’s easy to drop preconceived notions about All Flavor No Grease and just enjoy the food.
Once in a while in Watts, two opposing groups of gang members will set aside their differences for a moment to order from the truck window of All Flavor No Grease. In that moment, the community is glued together by melted cheese and dripping sauces. Peace radiates from a styrofoam box, a tin foil wrapper, a plastic fork and knife. Food won’t fix everything, but for few minutes on a Friday afternoon, it feels like it might.

Food for the people · With locations on Jefferson Boulevard and Vernon Avenue, La Flor Blanca was established in the early ’90s. Alexis Uriel Navarrete runs the Jefferson location and aims to grow the restaurant’s client base by attracting descendants of Latin American immigrants. (Julia Rosher | Daily Trojan)
For most college students, the thought of operating their own restaurant at age 22 is daunting.  But Alexis Uriel Navarrete, a junior at California State Polytechnic University Pomona and owner of Salvadoran eatery La Flor Blanca, sees it as an exciting challenge. 
The restaurant, which is located on Jefferson Boulevard, is ornamented distinctly. On one side, framed photos of the ocean run along its interior and on the other, there are depictions of historic destinations in El Salvador, like Tazumal and Monumento al Divino Salvador del Mundo. The blue and gray walls have been a part of Navarrete’s life since he started cleaning them at only eight years old, a task he believes taught him responsibility.  
Fourteen years later, Navarrete inherited La Flor Blanca following his father’s retirement and set out to run the business with an eye for modernization.
“It was almost like I got the baton,” Navarrete said, adjusting the collar of his button-down shirt. “I got my stick in the marathon race and it was my turn.” His formal attire juxtaposes his youthful enthusiasm through hand gestures and the gleam in his eyes when he talks about La Flor Blanca. 
Navarrete finds a way to simultaneously express both his wisdom and enthusiasm — a balance evident in the steps he has taken to bring the restaurant into the digital age. 
Julia Rosher | Daily Trojan
Since taking over, Navarrete revamped La Flor Blanca’s business and marketing strategy to help the restaurant expand its customer base. He saw the establishment’s long history as an asset: La Flor Blanca’s Jefferson location has existed since 1999, and another location on Vernon Avenue owned by Navarrete’s uncle has been around since the early ’90s. 
Navarrete believes that technology could take the restaurant to new heights.
“[My family] built their base without social media,” Navarrete said. “Now imagine what I can do with just a little bit of marketing here and there, using Facebook advertisements and things like that. I could attract a different kind of clientele and introduce them to food that they never would’ve tasted before.”
By expanding La Flor Blanca’s social media presence with the handle
@la.flor.blanca on Facebook and Instagram, Navarrete hopes to attract Latin American immigrants who crave food from their youth, as well as connect with new customers who are unfamiliar with Salvadoran fare. He aims to introduce as many Angelenos as possible to the culture of El Salvador through its cuisine. 
“This is more than just food,” Navarrete said. “This is our identity … We’re a very small country but we have a big story to tell.”
This story, for Navarrete, is represented by pupusas: stuffed tortillas made out of corn flour and classically stuffed with cheese, meat and beans. Navarrete said that the simplicity of pupusas plays a big role in Salvadoran culture. 
“[Pupusas are] the people’s food,” Navarrete said. “We’re very humble people: We’re very happy and we’re not greedy. That’s the message behind the pupusa itself.” 
Though he is studying business administration with an emphasis in marketing, much of Navarrete’s knowledge about running La Flor Blanca stems from real-world experience rather than what he learned in the classroom.
“You’re never really ready for your call of duty … no matter how much you study, no matter what your GPA is, no matter what classes you take, and no matter how many business books you’ve read,” Navarrete said. “None of that taught me what I learned in the past two months of working in this restaurant because the true secret about running any business is knowing how to manage people. [Getting people] to work together and to have the same vision you have is by far the hardest thing.” 
Julia Rosher | Daily Trojan
Navarrete pointed out that to execute this vision, he has to treat every goal like a midterm: by setting deadlines, which turn ideas into action. Having the mindset of a student helps Navarrete run La Flor Blanca — as does being raised in the United States, Navarrete said. His perspective on running a restaurant 
business differs from that of his father, who left El Salvador in the 1980s during the country’s civil war. 
“[Owners like my dad] know what poverty feels like and they know that aiming for riches isn’t what they really want because they’re okay with the way things are right now,” Navarrete said. “They know that by growing it’s going be a bigger risk. But I’m a different person because I have a vision and a drive that I can’t get out of my head.”
Over the past few months, Navarrete has put his passion and ambition into action, upgrading La Flor Blanca in ways both small and large — from retaking menu pictures to rethinking the supply chain. As a result, he’s enjoyed seeing a new crop of customers coming into the restaurant with their families. 
“Out of all the restaurants in Los Angeles, I truly find it an honor when a father or mother decides to bring their kids here,” Navarrete said. “It’s heartwarming … Deciding to share an experience of eating right here is beautiful, and making sure I continue that and grow that is my mission.”

Frankie Leoni and Joe Barbara star as young Calogero and Sonny in “A Bronx Tale,” which plays at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre through Nov. 25. (Photo courtesy of Joan Marcus)
 The touring production of Chazz Palminteri’s semi-autobiographical work “A Bronx Tale,” entertains but never fully satisfies. 
Los Angeles is the touring company’s third stop on its national tour since closing on Broadway in August after a two-year run. The musical follows the story of a boy named Calogero (Joey Barreiro) who grows up in the Bronx in the 1960s. 
The show begins with the number “Belmont Avenue,” in which Calogero and his neighbors, a talented ensemble of dancers go about their daily lives as, Italian American. The audience is introduced to 9-year-old Calogero (Frankie Leoni), who witnesses a mob boss named Sonny (Joe Barbara) commit a murder. 
Young Calogero does not give Sonny up to the cops, and Sonny takes a liking to the little boy, who he decides to call “C.” Calogero starts working for Sonny, rolling dice for him in the bar (depicted in the energetic musical number, “Roll ’Em”), and doing other odd jobs. 
When Calogero’s father Lorenzo (Richard H. Blake) finds out Sonny has been paying the young boy, Lorenzo reprimands them both. But Calogero is hardly discouraged; 10 years later, Sonny becomes like a second father to him.
Barbara, who plays Sonny, executes the facade of an Italian mobster with ease. For a character whose first moment on stage involves murder, Barbara exhibited an impressive ability to win the audience over with his charm. 
The plot takes a turn when Calogero falls in love with Jane (Brianna-Marie Bell), a fellow Bronx native from a black neighborhood. Their star-crossed romance reflects the growing racial tensions in the post-Civil Rights movement, and as their lives become further entangled, the risks of being involved with the Mafia become increasingly apparent to the now-teenaged Calogero. 
The various storylines of “A Bronx Tale” run the gamut from effective to confusing. 
In the beginning of the first act, during which Leoni delights endlessly with his energy and musicality as young Calogero, the show presents itself as Calogero’s slow-moving journey into adulthood, which it partly is. But as themes of race, loyalty and violence make their way into the story, character development falls to the wayside and the melodrama of the second act feels unearned. 
The production was co-directed by Robert De Niro, who starred alongside Palminteri in the film version. The direction comes across as slightly misguided and fails to adequately serve the script, which could use extra character development at the beginning of the second act.
But the real highlight of the show is the witty writing by Glenn Slater and Palminteri. Palminteri addresses the sensitive content in a respectful and lighthearted way, while Slater’s lyrics are simple and catchy. “Out of Your Head” and “Webster Avenue” show off foot-tapping melodies by Alan Menken, but all of the songs are a testament to Menken’s illustrious career as a composer. 
Bell, who played Jane on Broadway before joining the touring company, shines as a formidable triple threat. She brings the perfect amount of spunk and ingenuity to a role that lacks depth. 
The show also noticeably lacks female representation, with only four women total in the Italian American and black ensembles. Aside from Jane, the only other female character is Rosina (Michelle Aravena), Calogero’s mom. 
But both the male and female ensemble members shine in the dance sequences, especially “I Like It,” with Leoni expertly leading them front and center. The fight choreography is also remarkable, which helps the Mafia storyline appear as realistic and entertaining as the sometimes-hammy comedic moments. 
“A Bronx Tale” tells a timeless story of love and revenge, in a recycled narrative of divisions that has proved its worth over the past 40 years. The touring production does the story justice, with a talented and hilarious cast to boot.

In the United States, the rate of mental illness and suicide is rising. 
According to the National Alliance for Mental Illness, 20 percent of youth aged 13-18 have a mental health condition. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for this age group and 90 percent of individuals who died by suicide reportedly had an underlying mental illness. Our country’s youth are dying and something has to be done. Mental illness can go undetected because of the lack of education and information provided about mental health. 
Mental health is an important subject in the realm of public health, and it should be treated as such. California needs to educate both academic professionals and students about mental health so that individuals can seek treatment sooner and not feel ashamed about living with a mental illness. 
Things like sex education, tobacco, drug and alcohol education have been implemented in schools nationwide for many years. However, mental health education has been neglected in most schools where students are suffering in silence, grappling with debilitating depression, anxiety, paranoia and other mental illnesses that they do not even fully understand. 
In these same halls, students are left in the devastating wake of a classmate’s suicide, or in the wake of a school whose sense of safety was threatened by yet another school shooting. These students deserve to understand what they’re feeling, know they are not alone and know how to get help. 
Recently, New York passed a law that made it mandatory for K-12 schools to include mental health in their curricula. California needs to follow suit and implement a similar law to educate youth about mental health at school. Attached to this law, California needs to provide a mandatory trauma-informed care in service education for teachers. With this training, educators will be able to identify behaviors through a trauma-focused lens and provide resources, teaching styles and strategies to create a safe environment. 
Early detection and intervention is imperative to promote the social and emotional well-being of our youth. In a 2016 article in the Journal of School Health, John Salerno argues that “adolescence is an opportune time to intervene on mental illness because many mental health conditions have their onset before the age of 20.”
By educating our youth, we can change how society looks and reacts to mental health. Change happens with education and we believe that talking openly about mental health from a young age can have a positive impact on the lives of young people. 
Early education can lead to early detection, therefore reducing suicide rates. 
According to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, the total cost of suicides and suicide attempts in the United States was $93.5 billion. Researchers at Brandeis University Heller School for Social Policy and Management, the University of Massachusetts and Education Development Center argue that psychotherapy and other interventions will lower the rate of suicides by 10 percent and an overall savings of $9.4 billion for the American economy. It would also save an estimated 4,100 lives each year. Early mental health education not only saves money, but lives. 
California lawmakers need to recognize this and make changes.

Early estimates by the United States Election Project revealed that voter turnout in last Tuesday’s midterm elections was the highest ever in the past 50 years. Despite increased participation across all demographics, especially those under the age of 30, voting remains disproportionately low among one group: students in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields, according to a 2012 study from Tufts University. 
For the sake of their own careers and the scientific advancement of the country, STEM students must actively participate in electing policy-makers who value the importance of their fields and voting for pro-STEM ballot measures. 
In the current political climate that has been hostile toward graduate students and climate change, it is crucial that STEM students abandon political indifference in favor of voting, activism and social engagement.
According to a study by Tufts University, voter turnout among college students was consistently the lowest with students majoring in a STEM field in the 2010 and 2014 elections. The same study found that political engagement across a variety of tasks — including activism, donating to campaigns and attending political meetings — was lowest among this demographic. 
This lack of involvement is largely due to political apathy, which has been fueled by the misconception that politics and STEM are mutually exclusive fields. In reality, scientific discourse is largely dictated by policy, and public perception of scientific issues can be easily manipulated by policy-makers. 
When non-scientifically conscious politicians are elected, aspiring scientists, engineers and mathematicians are sometimes those who are hit the hardest by policies that do not value scientific rigor or research funding. 
The magnitude of political impact on STEM students is exemplified by the experiences of USC alumnus Patrick Cho, who graduated in 2018 from the USC Department of Earth Sciences. Between his research and his experiences applying to graduate programs, Cho has seen a significant change in his academic life during the transition from the Obama administration to the Trump administration. According to data from the United States Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency has experienced $809 million in funding cuts in the last two years. 
These budget slashes have real-life consequences on students and professionals, and Cho has experienced these reverberations firsthand. 
“There have been more funding cuts for not just people applying for PhDs and professors applying for funding, but also for masters students like me,” Cho said. “A lot of [principal investigators] interested in taking me in for a PhD program were hit with funding cuts, and were no longer able to take me in.” 
Cho also cited the application experiences of his USC peers, all of whom were very competitive applicants but were not accepted into doctoral programs due to decreased funds. 
“Either you had to bring in your own money, you had to already publish a paper, or you were lucky enough to find a lab that has the money,” he said. 
Cho’s experience highlights the dangers of unchecked politics on careers in STEM, further reinforcing the inextricable relationship between public policy and STEM.
The predicament of these aspiring scientists is exacerbated by the decreased availability of financial aid for students pursuing careers in these fields. 
“Columbia has a list of outside sources where we can apply for scholarships from,” Cho said. “A lot of these are environmental organizations, such as the EPA, but a lot of these websites are completely shut down now, and their environmental-based scholarships are gone.” 
In addition to influencing who gets elected, STEM students also have the crucial responsibility of voting on state-level propositions. In the 2018 election, several states featured environmental regulation initiatives intended to mitigate climate change, such as the first-ever proposed fee on excess carbon emissions. 
However, despite repeated warnings of impending climate disaster from scientists around the world and a plethora of evidence to back up their claims, the majority of these measures failed to pass. STEM majors are some of the most qualified voters to make decisions concerning these science-related propositions on the ballot, and they should use their expertise to push voting outcomes in the right direction.
Despite a lack of involvement from students, it is encouraging that voters elected nine new scientists to Congress in the midterm elections, many of whom said they were motivated to run for office by the current administration’s anti-climate change views and unsuccessful health care proposals. This surge signifies that science does, in fact, have a place in politics, and STEM students should know that they have a place, too.

Toward the end of every semester, students start to receive emails asking them to complete course evaluations for each class they’re enrolled in. The University pushes them to complete these evaluations incessantly, even going so far as having instructors allocate class time for filling them out. 
On the surface, these evaluations seem great — they let students give their professors feedback so they can ostensibly improve their courses for future students. They also allow students an anonymous forum to bring up issues that they wouldn’t otherwise feel comfortable sharing with their professors. 
But the reality is much more complex, and can often introduce gender and racial bias toward instructors whose course evaluations can play a large role in their professional futures. 
For teaching assistants and writing instructors early in their careers, achieving tenure is a long journey. Course feedback is often required when applying for new jobs in higher education, and the University considers the evaluations when instructors are up for promotions. 
“I think sometimes students don’t consider who is going to be reading these things,” Ali Rachel Pearl, a writing instructor in the Thematic Option program at USC told me in an email. “I’m on the job market this year, which means jobs I’m applying to are requesting student evals as evidence of my teaching effectivity. I don’t think that’s something most students have in mind when they write these.”
For professors who already have tenure, course evaluations mean next to nothing. Their job security is nearly immutable, so feedback from students doesn’t affect them, unless the professor takes the time to incorporate feedback on their own account. 
“I remember that, as a university student myself, I considered evaluations as a moment when I got to deploy some agency, but I was often frustrated when I had to confront the fact that professors who I most heavily critiqued for poor pedagogy or unhealthy classroom environments were unlikely to read or be impacted by their evals,” Pearl said.
And these evaluations aren’t reliable indicators of faculty performance; according to a 2016 Studies in Educational Evaluation study, student learning outcomes don’t correlate with the teaching evaluations. Only 1 percent of variability in student learning could be explained by course reviews. 
Many of these skewed ratings can be attributed to bias against female teachers and teachers of color. A 2014 study in the Innovative Higher Education journal found that evaluations on a five-point scale of online courses with randomly assigned female instructor names are rated half a point lower than those for identical courses with randomly assigned male instructor names.
While there haven’t been any significant studies analyzing bias in evaluations for faculty of color, one can expect biases — subconscious or otherwise — to make their way into the evaluations in the same way they do for women. Stereotypes, appearance and tone of voice were all listed as factors that contribute to gender bias in evaluations, according to Inside Higher Ed. All of these factors contribute to bias toward people of color, both in and out of the classroom.
Major racial and gender disparities in currently tenured professors still exist. A 2016 study from USC’s Office of Institutional Research found that 73.8 percent of tenured professors are men, and 65 percent are white. Some of these disparities can be explained by the systemic bias in class evaluations because of the importance of course reviews in determining which professors get tenure.
However, fixing this issue isn’t easy. Student voices should matter in determining an instructor’s performance, but attempting to erase bias is essentially impossible. I don’t expect universities to stop using course evaluations anytime soon, but they should take them with a grain of salt — especially for the population’s most underrepresented in tenured faculty. And evaluations shouldn’t play as large of a factor in hiring or promotion decisions as the instructor’s academic scholarship and contributions to the University community beyond scholarship. 
When you fill out your course evaluations this semester, consider the implications of the feedback you give. Consider the subconscious biases that might be affecting your review of a course, and consider what your feedback might mean for your instructors. Changes on the University’s end won’t happen quickly, but being conscious of your own role in the evaluation process can still make a significant difference.

After he was released from prison in January 2014, Aris Mangasarian found it difficult to find the resources to apply to a four-year university from community college. 
In response to his struggles years later, the junior founded The Underground Trojans at USC, a group meant to help formerly incarcerated individuals who are low-level offenders transition from the judicial system to higher education.
“Essentially what we’re doing is reducing prison recidivism and increasing the likelihood of a more productive, healthier lifestyle for returning citizens,” said Mangasarian, who is majoring in psychology. “We’re using higher education as a bridge between incarceration and successful reentry into the community.”
The organization is connecting students at different community colleges with the hope of helping them transfer to four-year institutions like USC.
In community college, Mangasarian explained how his academic counselor was unable to answer his career-oriented questions because of his record of multiple low-risk criminal offenses. 
“They are not used to students asking those types of questions because we’re extremely non-traditional,” Mangasarian said. “Forget the color of your skin, your gender, your social economic status … none of those things matter. [Formerly incarcerated students] are just branded in a completely different way.”  
When Mangasarian was sent to a halfway house, which gives formerly incarcerated people a transition space from prison to general society, he was asked to find a job as a requirement. Although he found a temporary job in construction, he realized that higher-end companies would not hire felons. For this reason, he decided to pursue higher education — on his own, however.
“I started off on the wrong path,” he said. “I never went to high school … I started using drugs early in my life and ended up years behind bars. There was always this feeling of shame. I didn’t like the path I was on but I didn’t really see a way out. At some point, I wanted something different.” 
Ronaldo Villeda, a sophomore at Coastline Community College who was formerly incarcerated, is pursuing a path similar to Mangasarian. Villeda is currently receiving guidance from The Underground Trojans to apply to USC’s Iovine and Young Academy for the 2019-20 academic year. 
During his time at Orange County Juvenile Hall, Villeda took Distance Learning courses on general business, which sparked his interest in pursuing higher education and ultimately a career in business.
“For formerly incarcerated individuals, education is usually not an option,” Villeda said. “It’s not a route that they see. They just think, ‘Education isn’t going to do anything for me’ and that’s where they’re wrong.”
Villeda said the stigma surrounding individuals who have gone through the criminal justice system must be abolished because everyone deserves the right to an education. 
He said education is key regardless of a person’s background. 
“[People] need to be a little bit more compassionate because everybody has a story,” Villeda said. “You never know what people have been through. Right when you say, ‘I’m formerly incarcerated, I’m a felon’ I feel like you just get put into a category and you’re like an outsider.”
Rossier School of Education adjunct professor Robert Hill, who serves as the Underground Trojans’ advisor, said he hopes the organization will bring awareness to the formerly incarcerated student population inside and outside of the USC community and demonstrate that the students are just like any other students on campus. 
“We’re trying to make people aware that it’s okay to identify as formerly incarcerated,” Hill said. “It’s a special population of students that they shouldn’t have to fear. They should be identified so they can gain those resources.”
Mangasarian met Hill through the Restorative Justice Center at Glendale Community College, an organization for the formerly incarcerated he founded while studying there. 
Mangasarian created a workshop to help the formerly incarcerated polish their stories and communicate their experiences in a way that highlights their strengths, something he hopes to bring to Underground Trojans. 
“There are a lot of resources that formerly incarcerated students can use,” Mangasarian said. “But there isn’t something that is specifically geared toward us … We need to be informed on these [opportunities] so we can make these informed decisions about our future careers.” 
Just like he did, Mangasarian hopes students find the strength and empowerment to pursue education and to become leaders for social change and advocacy through his organization. 
“[We need to view them] as human beings,” Mangasarian said. “These are people who have paid their debts to society — enough is enough. How long do I have to be in prison for? I already did that, why am I marginalized? Why am I still being defined by my path … We should be given more chances.”

The mother of a former USC student and Phi Kappa Psi member filed a lawsuit against the national fraternity for wrongful death and negligence on Oct. 25, more than a year after her son’s death. 
Kathleen Russell, the mother of Alasdair Russell, claimed that the death of her son was prompted by a pledging incident in 2016, according to a lawsuit obtained by the Daily Trojan. 
Alasdair Russell committed suicide in April 2017 after withdrawing from USC that January. In the suit, Russell alleged that Phi Kappa Psi members forced her son to drink excessive amounts of alcohol at a party in October 2016, which caused him to fall off of a platform and injure his head.
“During said party, and due in part to the large amount of alcohol that Alasdair was made to consume as part of his obligations as a pledge, Alasdair fell off of an elevated platform, striking his head against the ground causing him to temporarily lose consciousness,” the lawsuit read.
According to the suit, fraternity members discouraged Alasdair from seeking medical attention through USC to avoid citation for hazing and providing alcohol to minors. 
After he was diagnosed with a concussion and alcohol poisoning at a nearby hospital in October 2016, Phi Kappa Psi members pushed Alasdair to continue drinking and “preparing the fraternity house for additional parties,” the lawsuit said. 
“The brothers of [Pi Kappa Psi] were fully aware that Alasdair sustained a head injury in his fall on the night of Oct. 28, 2016; however, instead of allowing Alasdair to heal from his injury, he [was] compelled by [fraternity members] to resume his obligations as a pledge,” the lawsuit read.
It also said that fraternity members gave Alasdair cocaine and Adderall to help him complete his pledge obligations.
Russell alleged that Alasdair’s behavior changed, and that he took a self-reported anxiety exam which endorsed that he experienced “nervousness, anxiety, depression, hopelessness and loss of interest in most daily activities” before withdrawing from USC in January 2017 and returning to his home in Florida, according to the lawsuit. 
“Over the ensuing weeks, Alasdair’s behavior and personality [became] increasingly more erratic and unpredictable,” the lawsuit read. “He [was] no longer the driven and accomplished young man who entered USC in August 2016. Alasdair [was] behaving compulsively, irrationally and expressing an intent to self-harm.”
Before committing suicide in April, Alasdair was involuntarily committed on two separate occasions in March 2017, but the lawsuit does not specify to what kind of medical facility he was committed.
Before his suicide, the lawsuit said that Alasdair was set to climb Mount Everest and aimed to become the youngest British climber to make the fastest ascent. Alasdair had previously climbed some of the highest mountains in the world and modeled for brands like Gap.
“At the time that Alasdair enrolled at USC in August of 2016 he had everything going for him: smarts, looks, athleticism, a vibrant personality and charisma,” the lawsuit read. “Alasdair was ready to make his mark on the world.”
In May 2017, the USC placed its Phi Kappa Psi chapter on interim suspension after receiving a letter from Russell, which outlined how Alasdair was impacted by the organization’s hazing practices. As of March 2018, the University no longer recognizes the campus chapter of Phi Kappa Psi as an active fraternity because of hazing and health and safety violations, according to the Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development site. 
The site also stated that the USC chapter has also been unrecognized by the Phi Kappa Psi national organization.
In the email, Russell’s attorney Ilan Heimanson said Russell filed the suit in the Los Angeles Superior Court to shed light on the issue of hazing in Greek life on college campuses. 
“Dr. Russell is joining a growing voice across the country that seeks to shed light onto the sickness of hazing currently plaguing Greek life, and aims to establish a new reality for fraternities across all colleges and universities,” Heimanson wrote. “A reality free of hazing and substances. A reality where Fraternities turn back to their original purpose, as positive centers of intellectual fellowship, charitable works and community service.”
Phi Kappa Psi’s national headquarters confirmed that they were named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
“Our thoughts and deepest condolences continue to be with the Russell family, their friends and all who have been impacted by this tragedy,” Beth Headrick, director of communications for Phi Kappa Psi, wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
 Due to pending litigation, the Phi Kappa Psi national office was unable to comment further. 
USC Student Affairs declined to comment on the lawsuit and the Interfraternity Council did not comment in time for publication. 
The Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development office directed the Daily Trojan to USC Media Relations, which did not comment in time for publication.

USC Concerts Committee announced Wednesday that EDM artist Ekali will headline Conquest 2018 and that the annual bonfire is canceled.
“The bonfire this year was canceled due to the concerns for air quality and, overall, the fact that there’s a lot of fires going on in Southern California,” said Fabiola Avina, the program coordinator of Student Affairs. 
The decision was made by both Student Affairs and the Los Angeles Fire Marshal. In place of a bonfire, there will be a “Pie a Bruin” activity where students can throw a whipped cream or shaving cream pie at cutouts of bruins bears. UCLA also canceled the bonfire at their Beat ’SC Tailgate and Rally, Avina said. 
The event will launch with a Esports Varsity League tournament between USC and UCLA, where teams will compete in League of Legends, Overwatch, Super Smash Bros. and Hearthstone.
“Even though a lot of kids on Concerts Committee have zero idea about Esports and we’re not really into video games, we understand that there is a large portion of the student body who is so we’re excited to introduce that,” said Kira Stiers, director of USC Concerts Committee. 
The concert will feature Canadian EDM artist Ekali and rapper Tierra Whack. Last year’s Conquest included performances by rapper Lil Pump and EDM artist Mr. Carmack.
With a SoundCloud following of 187,000, Ekali has gained prominence in the music industry and completed a U.S. tour.
“Ekali is someone who’s sold out shows in L.A. and also has been super popular on the Brownies & Lemonade circuit and those are shows that a lot of USC kids patron at,” Stiers said. “He was also at Coachella last year at the DoLab so we heard a lot about his set there. We just keep our ears open to see who and what USC kids are talking about.” 
Ekali is best known for his songs “Leaving,” “Blame” and “Babylon” which have collectively amassed over 13 million plays on Spotify. He has collaborated with artists such as Gravez and Denzel Curry and performed at festivals like Coachella, Hard Summer and Life is Beautiful.
In addition to making music, Ekali has also been credited as a writer on Drake’s album “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late.” 
Opener Tierra Whack is a 23-year-old rapper from Philadelphia who is known for her debut album “Whack World” released this year. The album comprises 15 rap songs — each exactly a minute long.
“We booked [Whack] a while ago and she’s gained a lot of popularity since, but we really saw her as a rising act,” Stiers said. 
The rally will also feature the USC Song Girls, football team, Trojan Marching Band and USC Spirit Leaders. The carnival portion will include a ferris wheel, carnival games, a jousting arena and an interactive black light tunnel.
There will also be a slew of food trucks including burritos, burgers and sundaes from vendors Mr. Coolee, The Los Lobos Truck, Green Truck and El Flamin’ Taco. Special discounts will be offered to students who pay with their Apple Pay Cash balance. 
New features at Conquest this year will include an LED wall at the back of the stage and 4,000 LED wristbands provided by  Abercrombie & Fitch, which will blink and light up along with the show. Stiers said these additions will add a lot to the production value of the event.

The Conquest 2018 pep rally, carnival and concert will take place Thursday from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. in McCarthy Quad and is free for all students.
