Scientists might be one step closer to reducing the symptoms of chronic pain and injury thanks to groundbreaking research by USC Professor David McKemy and his research team, who identified and shut off the network of neurons that control cool temperature sensations.

McKemy, an associate professor of neurobiology at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, worked alongside a team of graduate and undergraduate students. Through their research, they were able to identify a previously unknown sensory neuron named TRPM8, which is specifically able to sense cold. They then proceeded with a study to eliminate the neuron from the cells and observed how the mice in their study would be affected in the neuron’s absence.
“We thought if these neurons really do sense cold, what happens if we get rid of them in a mouse model?” McKemy said.
After three years of research, McKemy and his team were able to successfully remove the neurons from the cells, something that made the laboratory mice incapable of feeling cold but still able to feel heat and touch.
“That was really the surprise for us,” McKemy said. “We didn’t know these neurons were so specific to cold sensation and not to the sensation of heat and touch.”
The study has narrowed down which cells are involved in detecting cold, which greatly impacts the way in which scientists understand and can potentially respond to the sensation of pain.
McKemy’s research might be applied in the future to help reduce the symptoms of injuries and chronic pain, since injuries have increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli such as temperature and force. Chronic pain conditions are associated with cold stimuli; Thus, if TRPM8 neurons in cells of subjects enduring chronic pain or injuries were turned off in the same way as the cells in his mice study, symptoms of pain could potentially be alleviated.
“We have some interesting routes which can be taken to either relieve pain or block it from ever happening,” McKemy said.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary on Wednesday, Feb. 20. 
Crimes against property
At 3:55 p.m., a suspect painted nail polish on the driver’s side door of a non-USC female’s vehicle while the car was parked in front of 2716 Ellendale Place.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 7:07 p.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect causing a disturbance in the pharmacy at University Gateway Apartments and detained him for investigation. A check of the suspect’s name revealed three outstanding warrants, so the suspect was arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
At 11:45 p.m., DPS officers responded to a report of an intoxicated student having pushed a security guard at West 27th Place Apartments when he was confronted about breaking a bottle in a sixth floor hallway. The security guard did not request criminal charges and the student was escorted from the premises without further incident.
 
Correction
“Talk Back tackles Cal education” (Feb. 21) incorrectly stated that USC College Democrats Finance Director Catherine Shieh was an intern at the U.S. Department of Education. Shieh interned for Rep. Mike Honda and served as a field representative to the U.S. Department of Education on his behalf.
The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The Community Service Awards, distributed annually to students who go above and beyond in serving the local community, will undergo a radical change in procedure this year.
Since the 1990s, awards had been offered jointly through the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, represented by JEP; Student Affairs, represented by the USC Volunteer Center; and USC Civic Engagement at an annual dinner. Now, Dornsife, the Marshall School of Business, the Gould School of Law, the Viterbi School of Engineering and other schools and departments plant to take part in the annual Community Service Banquet on April 16 at Town and Gown.
The awards will be distributed among various departments and schools to reflect their increased involvement in the past two decades.
Director of Non-Profit Partnerships at the Joint Educational Project Office Jacqueline Whitley said that, although the numbers are not finalized, as many as eight to 15 different schools are expected to take part in this year’s awards ceremony, each with one designated winner.
The idea for change came last year when Civic Engagement host its own event.
“When it looked like the office of Civic Engagement was going to break off from how we were doing the awards previously, we saw that as an opportunity to invite schools and academic units from across the campus and make this more of a unified event,” Whitley said.
Whitley said the new system will better unite students from different schools within the university as it will give them a chance to coalesce in a centralized location for one evening.
“There are so many awesome things being done all around campus and sometimes it’s kind of decentralized,” Whitley said. “But, let’s see how many people we can get in one place to highlight the great work that both community members and students are doing.”
Associate Dean of Students and Director of USC Volunteer Center Judi Garbuio, who aided in brainstorming the new changes, echoed Whitley’s sentiments.
“It’s great networking,” Garbuio said. “It provides more of an avenue for students to learn about what other students are doing and it’s a great vehicle for deans to promote what the students are doing within their academic units. It’s a win-win every way around.”
Although the criteria have not changed for preexisting awards, this year’s dinner will include four new categories of awards: the Extraordinary Engagement Award, Multiple Engagements Award, Innovations in Service Learning Award and Advocacy and Activism Award. Each school in attendance will focus on one category of its choosing and pick a single winner based on that category.
Pre-existing awards, such as the Grace Ford Salvatori Scholarship and Desiree Benson Award, will still be awarded based on the same qualifications, though they will not be presented at this year’s dinner.
Whitley acknowledges that the changes might be risky, given that this is the first year they will be implemented.
“We’re still in the process of seeking out the changes before the [dinner],” Whitley said. “We’re still figuring it out.”
Whitely said, however, that the changes are necessary to the continuing development of USC students.
“A great takeaway is seeing what an important role the local community plays with academics at the university and really seeing the wide breadth of different things that are happening on campus with the community,” Whitely said. “Hopefully, students will be inspired to come up with new and great ideas to deepen their learning as well as help the community.”
Alan Raouf, a senior majoring in policy, planning and development who volunteers as a youth basketball coach, was enthusiastic about the new developments.
“Each major puts their focus on different aspects of society. By doing this, every different angle of the community will be supported,” Raouf said. “Not everyone has the opportunity and privilege to come to USC. It’s important to give back the knowledge and experience we gain here to the community.”
Garbuio hopes these changes will motivate students of all majors to realize the importance of community service.
“By giving up your time and talent, you think that you are helping other people, but really, you end up gaining more from the experience than you give,” Garbuio said.
Now this is the type of university student activity and news event USC needs more of–not Phi-esta, ,USC Betches and Playboy #2 Party School, FB Hookup page etc., etc., etc
Amen!

Many students and coworkers who knew Huey Paul Long remember him for his infectious smile. Long, who worked at the university for more than 30 years, died Tuesday night in his sleep.
A native Angeleno, Long has always been a part of the extended Trojan community. Long is survived by his wife and three sons.
Long, who served as a maintenance worker, was a fixture in the Von KleinSmid Center. VKC Library Assistant Manager Mary Clark, who knew Long since she began working at the university in 2007, said his absence will be felt by all who knew him.
“He was admired and loved by all of his coworkers,” Clark said. “Everyone that he encountered had those similar feelings about the genuineness and the humanistic qualities he had. And he saw the best in everyone, too.”
Though Long had been sick for some time, he never let it distract from his work.
“I know he had been battling some health issues, but he was just trying to get through it and keep working,” Clark said. “He loved working here and being around the students and staff and faculty. It was that driving force for him that helped him keep going.”
Throughout his time at the university, Long fully embraced his role as a member of the Trojan Family. It was not unusual to find Long cheering on the Trojans at various events, and supported USC even through his attire.
“Always sporting his USC cap,” Clark reminisced. “It couldn’t just be any type of USC cap — it had to be the one that fit just right. He was very pristine about all of that.”
His love of sport was also lifelong. When Long attending John C. Fremont High School, he was an accomplished competitor on the track team.
Though injuries interfered with Long’s passion to pursue a track career after high school, he remained an avid sports fan and enjoyed following all aspects of Trojan athletics.
“He loved all the sports,” Clark said. “Not just football, but all of the teams. He loved the band — just everything.”
Long had a lasting impact not only on his coworkers, but also the students who had the fortune of seeing him every morning. Jenny Chen, a senior majoring in print and digital journalism said Long always made the effort to have a connection with everyone he met.
“Huey was one of the most generous people that I’ve ever met,” Chen said. “I think we were all really lucky to have him in our lives.”
Linda Fawaz, a senior majoring in international relations, noted his good nature every morning.
“He was just like sunshine everyday,” Fawaz said. “He would ask everyone how they were doing. He always helped us out whenever we needed anything.”
For those who knew Long, his loss will not only be that of a friend, but of someone who exemplified what it means to be a Trojan.
“He just had the best heart,” Chen said. “He felt like family and he treated everyone — especially the people at the library that he has known for so long — like family. I know we’re all really going to miss him.”
Though Clark said Long’s joyous “hello” every morning will certainly be missed, his enthusiasm will never be forgotten.
“Those of us who had the distinct pleasure of knowing him — we are better because of it,” Clark said. “What a difference he made.”
 
A memorial service for Long has not yet been scheduled.

A major in critical Facebook studies might be a long time coming, but the study of social media technology and interaction is making its way into classrooms at USC.
Cyber learning · Anurag Devanapally, a graduate student in the computer science and games program, designs a graphic. Media Arts + Practice majors will explore various media. — Abishek Hariharan | Daily Trojan 
Beginning fall 2013, the School of Cinematic Arts will offer a Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy in Media Arts + Practice, which will allow students to specialize in digital arts ranging from visual storytelling to interactive data displays. The program capitalizes on the growing need for cinematic technology across a variety of sectors.
Director of the Media Arts + Practice Program Holly Willis said the increased relevance of digital communication in business, urban planning and the law was one of the major reasons the major was added.
“Storytelling is fundamental — not just in entertainment, but in every  industry,” Willis said. “There is a growing need across every field for people who understand the power of the cinematic arts and can use it effectively to better inform, educate, interpret and communicate in a world that is inundated with data and information.”
Some students expressed enthusiasm about the wide variety of fields that the degree applies to. Katie Durocher, a sophomore majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, said the interconnectedness of professional skills makes the new degree especially important.
“As communications go digital, the skills necessary to effectively convey things like data and advertisements will become critical,” Durocher said. “We’re nearing the point where future professionals in my field will rely on the skills of cinematic design to make our work more successful.”
Willis said staying on the cutting edge of cinematic technologies and applications makes the School of Cinematic Arts stand out.
“SCA is known as a home to some of the best writers, directors, producers, animators, game designers and critics in the world,” Willis said. “People who specialize in creating or commenting on the entertainment industry and our program [will] build on that legacy.”

USC’s No. 2 men’s tennis team (12-1) is looking to beat the Bruins on Friday, as it hosts No. 3 UCLA (9-1) in a nonconference match at Marks Stadium. The match, which is set to start at 3 p.m., will mark the second time the teams face each other in a week, after having clashed at the ITA National Team Indoor championships in Seattle, Wash., on Sunday.
Clutch · Sophomore Roberto Quiroz helped the Trojans defeat the Bruins last week, taking the game-clinching match against UCLA’s Adrien Puget. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
In that matchup, the Trojans pulled off a dramatic come-from-behind victory and handed UCLA its first loss of the season. After USC gave up the doubles point, they fought back in singles play to tie the score at 3-3. Sophomore Roberto Quiroz clinched the 4-3 victory for USC in a third-set tiebreaker over UCLA’s Adrien Puget.
Though Quiroz received praise for his clutch performance, USC head coach Peter Smith was also impressed with the play of sophomore Eric Johnson and freshman Max de Vroome.
“Eric and Max showed me, the rest of the country … that they’ve got what it takes to win,” Smith said.
No. 46 Johnson and No. 109 de Vroome are just two of USC’s eight ranked singles players, the highest being No. 10 junior Emilio Gomez. In addition, USC has two ranked doubles teams, the highest of which comprises junior Ray Sarmiento and sophomore Yannick Hanfmann, who was just named Pac-12 player of the week due to his dominant play in the tournament.
Meanwhile, UCLA’s roster features four ranked singles players, the highest being No. 13 sophomore Marcos Giron. The Bruins do not have a ranked doubles team. Though the Trojans appear to have the advantage on paper, recent matches between teams have proven to be quite unpredictable.
Early last season, the top-ranked Trojans trounced No. 3 UCLA in Westwood, 6-1. Not two months later, the Bruins shocked USC by pulling off a 4-3 upset and ending the Trojans’ 45-match winning streak that spanned over a year. The Trojans bounced back, though, and defeated UCLA 4-2 a week later to take home the Pac-12 tournament, before beating them one more time in the semifinals of the NCAA championship tournament.
Though the Trojans trail the Bruins 100-88 all-time, Sarmiento is thankful that the team has been victorious in the past three match-ups and hopes that the streak will continue Friday.
“We love battling against UCLA and it’s nice to know the [win] has been on our side the last couple times,” Sarmiento said. “We just have to keep taking care of our own business.”
The team also hopes that today’s match against the Bruins will not be as close as Sunday’s was. Though Smith and his players agree that earning the doubles point is the first step toward securing the victory, they have different opinions on how to achieve that goal.
“We have to come out of the starting blocks strong and with a lot of energy,” sophomore Jonny Wang said.
Smith takes a more relaxed approach to securing the doubles point.
“We’re too pumped up,” Smith said. “The guys are always ready to play … it’s getting [the team] calm that’s the hard part.”

I came to a depressing conclusion this morning: USC isn’t going to make the NCAA basketball tournament. And they aren’t going to the NIT tournament, either.
But you know what? I’m still really happy about this 12-14 squad. And after Sunday, I might be a whole lot happier.
Sunday is when the Trojans host arch-nemesis UCLA at the Galen Center, looking for their second season sweep over the Bruins in four seasons. By beating the Bruins, it would not only deflate the entire Westwood area, but would signal the start of something: that USC basketball is for real.
Now, I’m not saying a win over UCLA would take away the pain of 2011’s 6-26 record or this year’s record, regardless of how things wrap up. It doesn’t make up for the fact that UCLA has won 11 national titles in the sport and USC has none. What it does do, however, is show real improvement — that the Trojans aren’t content to be bottom feeders for eternity.
After a gutsy stretch of games that the Trojans have recently won, head coach Bob Cantu’s squad looks like it might be able to win a few more contests this season. Fans won’t have to wear bags on their heads or pretend they don’t know where the Galen Center is. Sunday’s game is the culmination of momentum building up for USC men’s basketball. It’s officially game time.
I’ll say it outright: the Sunday game means everything.
The athletic department is forcing students sitting in a certain section to wear bright gold “Trojan Fever” t-shirts. Tickets for the game aren’t particularly cheap. For the first time in a while, the Galen Center might look filled. There are going to be an awful lot of people watching the game on TV, too.
This is a chance for the Trojans to prove they belong. That they can hang on the court with the big boys again. That this isn’t just a football school. That USC basketball can be more than an afterthought.
And let’s not forget the players who are going to be on the court, either. There are stars all around the board for both teams. UCLA features freshman guard Shabazz Muhammad, a likely top-five pick in the 2013 NBA draft. They have the Wear twins, both of whom will likely be NBA players. They have a six-foot-nine point guard named Kyle Anderson who is built a little like another point guard who used to rule Los Angeles (minus the assist statistics).
Meanwhile, the Trojans are less heralded but are getting recognition because of their recent four-game winning streak that came to an end against Cal last Sunday. Senior guard Jio Fontan, who missed all of last season with a knee injury, is playing with a lot of heart. He’s hitting big free throws and isn’t turning the ball over. Junior forward Dewayne Dedmon is starting to look like every bit of his seven-foot frame. Senior forward Eric Wise and sophomore guard Byron Wesley are hitting shots and are looking like solid players. Heck, junior guard J.T. Terrell finally looks like a top-100 prospect.
Look at this. I’m getting excited about USC basketball. I’m thrilled the Trojans are in sixth place in the Pac-12. There are players on this USC team worth watching. This game against UCLA will be a culmination of all the good things that have come from this roster and the stellar coaching of Cantu. The Bruins have an awful lot to play for come Sunday: seeding in the conference tournament and getting off the NCAA tournament bubble. The Trojans, though, have something bigger to play for: pride.
Pride is the heart of all athletics, whether it be at the high school, collegiate or professional level. Beating the Bruins would give this team all the pride in the world. The Trojans aren’t going to win a national championship this season. They probably won’t next year either. They might make the NCAA tournament in the next couple of years, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they didn’t. It doesn’t matter. Beating UCLA will add to the excitement that the Trojans have been building on during the past few weeks. It will get a fan base that is in dire need of hope genuinely excited for basketball. Who would have thought that was even possible in Troy?

College baseball teams play four games a week — three over the weekend and one on Tuesday or Wednesday. The midweek games are often toss-ups: teams are resting their best pitching arms for the weekend to come.
Onwards · Freshman outfielder Vahn Bozoian and the Trojans are looking for a more consistent offensive performance against the Matadors. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
So though many teams could win a random midweek game, it’s over a three-game weekend set that the best teams will come out on top.
At least that’s the theory.
The Trojans will put that theory to the test this weekend when they take on Cal State Northridge in a three-game tilt. The Friday and Sunday games will be held at Dedeaux Field at USC, with Saturday’s matchup in Northridge. It’s the first time this season the Trojans (2-2) will play a “classic” three-game series, having played three different teams in three different locations last weekend.
“It makes a difference,” USC coach Dan Hubbs said. “Playing the same team three times in a row, you get to know the personnel pretty well.”
The Trojans did not play the Matadors (3-1) last year, so USC don’t have quite the same familiarity as they do with other Los Angeles area schools that are often on the schedule. But all that means is that the focus is internal.
“I don’t know anything about their offense,” sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs said. “We can’t worry about our opponent. We have to focus on playing our game because that’s what we can take care of. And if we do that we can win.”
Stubbs is hitting just .154 this season, but as catcher, his value is demonstrably greater behind the plate than at it. On Wednesday night against Loyola Marymount, Stubbs threw out all three runners who tried to steal against him.
“I get fired up when someone tries to steal,” Stubbs said. “It gives me a chance to help out my pitcher and throw him out. So obviously I enjoyed [Wednesday] night.”
One of Hubbs’ biggest points of emphasis as a coach is defense— specifically not giving up any extra bases.
“Any free base we give them is just a better opportunity for them,” Hubbs said. “So we make defense a big priority. And a lot of that starts with Garrett behind the plate.”
Stubbs has started behind the plate in all four of the Trojans’ games this year, and says he is prepared to catch all three this weekend as well. But catchers often get one game a week off, and Hubbs said he will play it by ear this weekend.
“We’ve been toying with the idea of catching [junior designated hitter] Jake Hernandez one game,” Hubbs said. “He’s been catching really well, and that also lets us get another bat in the lineup because it opens up the DH spot.”
Hubbs said if Hernandez were to catch, he would do so Friday night against Matador lefty Jerry Keel, who threw seven shutout innings a week ago against Saint Mary’s.
“He’s excellent,” Hubbs said of Keel. “He’s a big-body guy who was their ace as a freshman last year and has gotten better.”
USC’s rotation stays the same as the weekend prior. Junior Bobby Wheatley will start on Friday, sophomore Wyatt Strahan will start on Saturday and freshman Kyle Twomey will start on Sunday. The first pitch tonight at Dedeaux is at 6 p.m.

The USC men’s volleyball team closed its four-game homestand against UC Santa Barbara on Thursday night at the Galen Center. After the deflating loss to UCLA on Monday, the Trojans were desperately seeking a home victory, this time against a struggling Gaucho squad.
Not enough · Sophomore Micah Christenson (above) was unable to spur the Trojans to a victory against the UCSB Gauchos. USC won just one of four sets against its opponent on Thursday night. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In the end, though, USC lost to UCSB in four sets (16-25, 28-30, 25-21, 21-25).
Ranked No. 13 in the preseason, UCSB’s woes heading into Thursday’s match overshadowed even the Trojans’. Despite wins over Cal State Northridge and UC San Diego, the Gauchos possessed a meager 5-11 record and were winless on the road. Though the Trojans entered the match with an equally unimpressive record (3-8), the return of libero Henry Cassiday and outside hitter Joey Booth made USC a much more imposing team.
UCSB quickly jumped ahead in the first set, riding a wave of solid hitting to a 9-3 lead. However, thanks to a quick timeout and some words of encouragement from sophomore captain Micah Christenson, the Trojans began to improve. Freshman Josh Kirchner led the attack after the break, contributing to three consecutive points and putting USC back in the game.
Unfortunately, the Trojans were unable to sustain their high level of play and fell behind once again, this time for good. The Gauchos took the set by a wide margin of 25-16.
The Trojans had a different look at the start of the second set. Aided by a number of Gaucho mistakes, as well as some acrobatic play from Cassiday, USC was able to keep pace with UCSB. The two teams continued to go back and forth, with the Trojans unable to gain any advantages.
However, the intensity of the match took on a new level after UCSB took a 24-22 lead. The Trojans went on an impressive run, fighting off six set points before finally yielding to the Gauchos, 30-28.
“The first two sets weren’t good enough, and again, we didn’t slow them down enough at the net,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “We’re just not getting any stops and we’re putting the right game plan out there. It’s just a little breakdown here, a lack of discipline there. It’s just a lot of little things that we have to get worked out.”
The second set might not have gone in the Trojans favor, but they certainly took some momentum into the next set. Though the two teams battled back and forth, USC was in control and overcame the Gauchos 25-21.
The energy continued into the fourth set, as the Trojans jumped out to a 6-1 lead, but this time they could not sustain it. The Gauchos fought back to even the game at 11 and eventually took control of the set thanks to some strong play from senior Dylan Davis. With a comfortable lead in hand, UCSB put away the Trojans 25-21 and took the match in four sets.
With the loss, USC drops to 3-10 on the season and now has to turn things around on the road if it hopes to stay in the playoff hunt.
“We need to turn around and get something going,” Ferguson said. “We don’t know how. We are going to stay the course, but we just have to ratchet up the intensity every day in practice and keep coaching up the guys.”
The Trojans will have a sizable break before they head north to Stockton to face the Pacific Tigers on March 2. The Tigers defeated USC on Jan. 20 by a score of 3-1.
The Trojans have 13 regular season games remaining and will play the next four contests on the road, including a trip to Hawai’i to take on the Warriors on March 8 and March 10.
Couldn’t agree more…beginning to think the biggest change that needs to be made is the firing of Pat Haden and get someone who has a pair.
Another sad performance by this team and Coach. Going the way of women’s basketball and following the
travesty of the football team. Some changes need to be made in the athletic dept. who refuse to take action
on the sorry state of affairs of Trojan sports.

The race for the No. 1 spot this Presidents’ Day weekend was a close one, with A Good Day to Die Hard skirting slightly ahead of Identity Thief — the previous weekend’s winner — and Safe Haven,  likely since it was the main option for couples romancing it up for Valentine’s. This was despite that movie having arguably the most insipid twist in a romance since the 9/11 reveal in Remember Me. Just a fair warning.
Even Escape From Planet Earth came in with $21.1 million over the weekend; sadly, the Twilight wannabe Beautiful Creatures bombed with a sub-$10 million gross.

Though the new Die Hard did get the weekend crown for being the first action blockbuster of the year, it didn’t do that much better than other Presidents’ Day action flicks such as the Ghost Rider sequel last year or 2011’s Unknown. Though the reviews were downright scathing, it’s still John McClane on a holiday weekend, so many expected it to do better.
Die Hard might have simply been a victim of action-star fatigue.Just earlier this year, Bruce Willis’ Expendables co-stars all bombed with their subsequent movies: Schwarzenegger in The Last Stand, Statham in Parker and Stallone in Bullet to the Head. Using an action star without a complementing cast just doesn’t work in the modern era like it used to.
This situation doesn’t give much hope to one of the new releases this weekend: Snitch, starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as a father who goes undercover to save his son. The film also stars Susan Sarandon, Benjamin Bratt and Michael Kenneth Williams (Omar be comin’ to the theater!).
The wrestler-actor has had a successful streak at the box office lately with Fast Five and Journey 2. In fact, Johnson is going to be in a new movie at the end of every month until the summer: G.I. Joe: Retaliation in March, Michael Bay’s Pain and Gain in April and Fast & Furious 6 in May.
However, the thing to remember is that those films are either ensemble films or a franchise feature. And in the case of Pain and Gain, he seems to be more of a supporting role to Mark Wahlberg (and arguably Michael Bay himself).
The last time that he was the solo lead in an action film was 2010’s Faster, which bombed despite its release during Thanksgiving weekend. Looking at his career as a whole, his most successful movies have actually been family features such as Tooth Fairy, The Game Plan and Race to Witch Mountain.
So the interesting thing to consider about Johnson is that, for more than a decade, he has been considered the successor to the legends of the action genre, but has never really had many solo action films to his name. However, by being in other genre films, he’s been able to appeal to multiple audiences in a way that the previously mentioned action stars haven’t been able to do.
Regardless, the film itself seems a bit run-of-the-mill. Even though Johnson’s awareness is at an all-time high (considering he’s the current WWE champion), there’s nothing in the previews that have made this a big draw. Nonetheless, it might just be people want after being so disappointed in the fifth Die Hard last week. A $13 – 15 million weekend is the most likely result; even if it bombs, Johnson still has a big year ahead of him.
The second release of the weekend is Dark Skies, a horror-thriller directed by Scott Stewart (Legion, Priest) and starring Keri Russell as a mom trying to protect her family from a deadly force. This is from Jason Blum, the producer of the Paranormal Activity series, Insidious and Sinister: That alone should tell you what kind of horror to expect from this film.
The trailers and marketing have been effective, but it seems to be skirting around confirming the sci-fi elements (the kid’s shadow is in the shape of an alien, for crying out loud) rather than just embracing what seems to be a cool, interesting interpretation of a sci-fi horror.
Blum has struck gold with this style of horror in the past, not to mention making horror films that appeal to the critics just as much as audiences. Both Sinister and Insidious were able to open around $15 million and finish around $50 million, so it’s possible that it’ll finish with the same take. The thing to hold against this film, though, is that it didn’t have the box office legs of Insidious or the hype of Sinister.
It’ll likely fight it out with Snitch for the No. 1 spot; but as is the case with any PG-13 horror film (like Mama earlier this year), it could break out to a weekend total close of $20 million.
This weekend certainly has plenty of options at the box office. Still, the weekend has a trump card in store: Most people will choose to watch the Oscars on Sunday.

Pie-high dreams · I Heart Pie was the dream of Nick and Emily Cofrancesco, amateur bakers who turned their hobby into a business. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
 
As the shoppers peruse the vendors it seems like every one of them becomes tempted, at least for a moment, by a small pie shop tucked in between the shops called I Heart Pies.
I Heart Pies began as the brainchild of husband-and-wife duo Nick and Emily Cofrancesco. Both of them worked in the entertainment industry; Emily as a reality TV editor and Nick as a script coordinator and animator at Nickelodeon, who worked on popular children’s shows such as Danny Phantom and The Mighty B!. Come holiday time, the Cofrancesco’s homemade pies made the rounds in studio circles and eventually spread to employees at other big-name companies such as Warner Brothers and Disney before the Cofrancescos felt that they might be onto something.
The Cofrancescos saw a chance to translate their love for pie into a business opportunity. Nick still works full time as an animator, but Emily eventually backed out from Hollywood and enrolled in culinary school to focus on concocting pies full-time.
For the Cofrancescos, the choice of starting a pie business was obvious.
“Well, we love pie, and we noticed there [weren’t] too many pie places in Los Angeles. It was House of Pies and Marie Callender’s, and that’s about it,” Nick said. “So we wanted to do something different, less mass-produced, smaller-scale and to make everything by hand and from scratch using locally sourced ingredients.”
Some recent offerings are tempting: The cellophane-sheathed single serve “mini pies” shine invitingly in the sun, and the sweet pies include a blood-orange cream pie, an apple crumb pie and a chocolate-pecan pie with bourbon (the Cofrancescos’ take on a derby pie).
“We try to use farmers [who] are in the Greater L.A. area,” Confrancesco said. “Our apples during the fall and winter time are from an orchard up in Oak Glen. When peaches and berries are in season, we scout the local farmers’ markets. We have a sweet potato farmer up in the Nipomo area [who] comes down.”
When asked where he found the blood oranges for the blood orange cream pie, Cofrancesco smiled and pointed across the walkway to a stand selling a variety of citrus fruit neatly arranged in rows: “Over there.”
A taste of the mousse-like blood orange cream shows an absolute mastery of balancing citrus and sweetness. Whereas one would normally expect the intense citrus of a fresh blood orange to scream over any other flavors, the pleasant creamy sweetness of the mousse tempers the citrus notes to a whisper. The overall impression is a tastefully restrained and silky blood orange cream that could become dangerously easy to eat by the spoonful.
In contrast, the apple crumb pie vibrantly flings its arms in the air with the flavors of fall. Despite the individual-sized pie being roughly the size of a medium apple, the cinnamon crumb aptly accentuates chunks of crisp apples that seem to burst forth with flavor.
For all the effort and attention to fillings, Cofrancesco said the crust is an equally, if not more, important player in all of I Heart Pie’s productions.
“It took [Emily] a while to get it where she wanted to be. It took about a year of experimenting with everything,” Confrancesco said. “Our gluten-free took two years to get to where we are today, ‘cause that’s a tricky thing [to get right].”
Cofrancesco’s experiment proves to be a success: This golden brown bastion of flavor is deeply nutty, flaky and stands up reassuringly to sweet fillings. It is curious and unfortunate, then, that the crust does not have the same ingredient-augmenting properties on I Heart Pies’ savory offerings.
I Heart Pies’ savory chicken and mushroom pie employs the same philosophy of subtleties as its sweeter pies, but the result is not as pleasing as the gravy, chicken and mushroom  flavors are totally lost amid the robustness of the aforementioned crust. Here, the crust’s larger presence makes the overall product a little saltier and more buttery, but it is still nowhere near recompense for the absence of heartier gravy and more chicken and mushrooms. Fans of the comforting winter favorite might come away more than a little disappointed with I Heart Pies’ rendition, despite the still-phenomenal crust.
For the time being, I Heart Pies remains a delivery-only establishment when not at the Autry Farmer’s Market. In fact, only a handful of the full-size pies make it out to market, while most of them are delivered around the Los Angeles area by online order at www.IHeartPies.com or via subscription to the company’s Pie of the Month Club.
Still, one taste of the elusive pies is all the reason one needs to fall in love. Here’s to hoping that Los Angeles’ love affair with pie is a long and fruitful one.

Albeit a couple of exceptions (Daniel Day-Lewis and Anne Hathaway are practically shoo-ins for their given categories), the 85th Academy Awards (though apparently it’s just “The Oscars” now?) offers a higher level of competition compared to previous years.

Did anyone doubt that The King’s Speech would sweep at the Oscars a couple of years back? Was anyone really surprised when Meryl Streep beat out Viola Davis at last year’s show?
Thankfully, this year the gap between the quality of nominees has closed significantly, giving viewers something more to look forward to than red carpet fashion and an inevitable embarrassing moment from Ryan Seacrest.
Now, if you’re looking for some last-minute predictions so you can finally win the office Oscars poll, think again. Rather than predictions, here’s a look at those contentious contenders (the ones that close the gap and offer some exciting competition), what they have to offer and what their fighting chances might be.
Best Picture
The Nominees: Amour, Argo, Beasts of the Southern Wild, Django Unchained, Les Misérables, Life of Pi, Lincoln, Silver Linings Playbook, Zero Dark Thirty.
Though there are clear front-runners (Silver Linings Playbook, Zero Dark Thirty, Lincoln, Argo), the other options trail pretty closely behind — Les Misérables, not so much — in the best picture race.
Amour stunned with its painfully realistic portrayal of love at the end of life. Beasts of the Southern Wild left viewers in awe with its ingenuity and honest, gripping story. Django Unchained proved to be more than another Tarantino bloodbath, instead prompting viewers to reflect on their sense of morality. Life of Pi wowed with staggering special effects and challenged viewers to examine their faith.
Doesn’t exactly sound like weak competition, does it? Still, said front-runners seemingly have the best chances at claiming that tiny, gold man we’re all so obsessed with.
Silver Linings Playbook isn’t your typical best picture nomination (it’s a bit more comedic than the Academy usually likes), but with a fantastic ensemble cast (all four leads were nominated) and an emotionally gripping narrative, the film is a strong candidate.
Zero Dark Thirty, another great film from Kathryn Bigelow (sorely missed in the best director category this year, ditto: Ben Affleck), confronted the brutal practices used in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, prompting viewers to question whether the end justifies the means. And with Jessica Chastain delivering a raw performance as a frustrated CIA agent who finds dead ends at nearly every corner, Zero Dark Thirty soars.
That leaves Argo and Lincoln, a battle between the fun historical drama (the unconventional choice) versus the traditional period piece (it practically screams “best picture nominee!”). Argo, from director/star Ben Affleck, grabbed critics’ attention for its ability to walk the thin line between Hollywood satire (see Alan Arkin) and a dramatic representation of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis.
Daniel Day-Lewis, supported by Hollywood elite Sally Fields and Tommy Lee Jones, delivers a staggering performance that fully immerses you in the Civil War era in Lincoln. The cinematography and direction of Oscar favorite Steven Spielberg is stunning, and Tony Kushner’s screenplay reads like poetry.
Best Director 
The Nominees: Amour (Michael Haneke), Beasts of the Southern Wild (Benh Zeitlin), Life of Pi (Ang Lee), Silver Linings Playbook (David O. Russell), Lincoln (Steven Spielberg) .
Haneke and Zeitlin are both wildcard choices, but worthy nonetheless. The former shines with his honest and raw portrayal of love and loss, and the latter with his fantastical, coming-of-age tale of a little girl trying to find her family.
Still, the directors receiving the most attention this year are Lee, Russell and Spielberg.
Lee blew viewers away with his beautiful landscapes, special effects (3D done right) and his charismatic young lead, Suraj Sharma, in Life of Pi. The versatile director makes you really, truly believe in and empathize with the protagonists, Pi and (CGI) tiger Richard Parker, giving their extraordinary relationship a sense of realism.
Part love story, part exploration of mental health issues, Russell’s Silver Linings Playbook convinces and immerses you in both. The endearing dark humor, brilliant performances and quick wit certainly add to that.
Then, Spielberg wowed viewers with his detailed look at President Abraham Lincoln’s uphill battle for justice, delivered in an eloquently written, beautifully shot and brilliantly played cinematic package.
Best Actress
The Nominees: Jessica Chastain, Jennifer Lawrence, Emmanuelle Riva, Quvenzhané Wallis, Naomi Watts.
Wallis proves she’s worth her salt with a deeply emotive performance, reflecting on the loss of her parents and home while still offering a sense of youthful hopefulness and adventure. And she’s only 9 years old, making her the youngest best actress nominee ever.
Emotional and physical pain plastered across her face, Watts delivers one of the best performances of her career in The Impossible, playing a wife and mother devastated by the 2006 tsunami while on a family vacation.
At 85 years old, Riva would be the oldest actress to win an Oscar, but more important is how Riva conveys fear and loathing at the end of life in Amour. Her potential Oscar-winning moment? After a second stroke, Riva’s character Anne can muster few words, giving Riva the challenge of communicating her character’s desire to end her life through a facial expressions — a task she pulls off.
Chastain immerses us in a 10-year pursuit for Osama bin Laden, making viewers feel for her every single time (and there were many) she and her team encountered a dead end. Still, Chastain keeps viewers fully engaged with her vigor and determination to put an end to the issue at hand.
Lawrence strikes the perfect emotional balance in Silver Linings Playbook. Rather than playing the part of Tiffany— a woman recovering from the death of her husband — as too crazy or mushy-in-love with her new dance partner, Lawrence lends the character a real human quality, one with which viewers can sympathize and relate.
Best Supporting Actor
The Nominees: Alan Arkin, Robert De Niro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tommy Lee Jones, Christoph Waltz.
“Argo f-ck yourself” jokes aside, Arkin left a memorable impression with his cheeky performance as a Hollywood producer, poking fun at the industry’s elite and, in effect, winning audiences over to root for Affleck and company.
De Niro’s turn in Silver Linings Playbook is his best role in recent memory. Though he spends most of the movie trying to convince the audience that there really is no better team than the Philadelphia Eagles, underneath all that football mayhem, you can see a father who loves his son and wants to help him through his recent divorce and mental breakdown.
The Master as a film might have fallen short of expectations, but Hoffman still shined as a self-righteous, manipulative leader of a religious movement called The Cause. Played with charisma, strength and vitality, Hoffman delivered yet again.
In Jones, we see a hard-headed man, set in his ways but with purpose. We encourage his stubbornness. We like how brash he is, because when it comes down to it, we see a man who sees past color, a man who believes in principle, human rights and (as we see later on) love.
Similarly, Waltz also plays a stubborn man, but we root for him nonetheless because his heart is in the right place: He sees people, not slaves. Quick wit and hilariously snarky attitude aside, it is this compassion that gives Waltz another chance at Oscar gold for Django Unchained.
Best Original Screenplay 
The Nominees: Amour, Django Unchained, Flight, Moonrise Kingdom, Zero Dark Thirty.
With painful honesty and overt realism, Amour captures the fragility of life. And Moonrise Kingdom, the quirky, dark horse of the group, shines with its endearing eccentricities.
Zero Dark Thirty is a film that builds slowly, but it is through this series of frustrations that the story really pays off. Poignantly, the film prompts viewers to question their morality: How far would you go to take down the leader of al-Qaida?
Flight also deals with issues of ethics. A true character study, Flight allows Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Don Cheadle and company to excel. Again, this film prompts viewers to question their morality.
Django Unchained challenges viewers, encouraging them to examine the way they understand race. In accordance with Tarantino’s directorial style, Django Unchained is a homage to Western films, and yet it goes a step further by prompting the viewers to look at the ugly and often untold truth that is slavery.

The Sequester and STEM
Congress, before the New Year began, agreed on a compromise to deal with the self-imposed “fiscal cliff,” a combination of deep spending cuts and a tax increase due to the expiration of the “Bush” tax cuts. However, this compromise only delayed the proposed sequestration cuts, which are across-the-board budget reductions for all federal agencies. Without further action, on March 1, 2013, federal support for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) programs will be cut by 9 percent — a reduction of more than $15 billion — as part of the sequestration cuts enacted by Congress.
It is important for our country to get our fiscal house in order, but we should not hold STEM programs hostage in order for Congress to work together. The bipartisan Bowles-Simpson Committee report noted that even as we cut spending, we need to “invest in education, infrastructure and high-value research and development to help our economy grow, keep us globally competitive and make it easier for businesses to create jobs.” Scientific and technological enterprise is responsible for over 70 percent of modern economic growth and cutting support for these programs is the wrong thing to do. We need to invest in our future, not put an axe to it.
STEM funding supports universities, such as USC, to do cutting-edge research in order to train our future scientists and engineers. In addition, research done in universities like ours spawns a new generation of entrepreneurial opportunities in medicine, technology and engineering. This allows our nation to compete for high quality, well-paying jobs in an increasingly globalized market place.
USC is a renowned research institution and STEM cuts would hinder our university in hiring top-notch faculty and attracting top students. These cuts would also likely be felt by students in non-STEM departments, such as the humanities and social sciences, as resources are shifted to help mitigate the impact of these reductions.
Ultimately, if these cuts are not prevented, we could see fewer people employed at USC, less research taking place and long-term effects on the prosperity and innovation of this country.
Urge Congress to stop deep cuts to STEM funding. Contact your local member of congress. Sign the petition at AvoidTheFiscalCliff.org. You can also join the campaign by visiting the website and uploading a 30-60 second video that highlights the importance of federal funding for your research.  Now is the time to act to preserve critical STEM funding for the good of the future.

With a twice-elected black president leading the country and increasing diversity in America’s communities, the move toward a world void of racism, sexism and other –isms seems to loom in the near future.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Sadly, however, racism continues to persist in appallingly boorish ways, even in places where such behavior should be the last of one’s concerns.
A recent lawsuit discovered by the media this past weekend revealed a situation between a black nurse named Tonya Battle and her workplace of 25 years, Hurley Medical Hospital in Flint, Mich. Battle was prohibited from caring for an infant patient based on the father’s request that no black people be around the child, according to The Huffington Post. The father also apparently showed the nurse’s supervisor “a swastika of some kind,” according to Battle, who spoke on the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner Morning Show. Battle was allegedly told by her supervisor that the father’s request was granted.
Though Hurley Medical later rejected the father’s wishes, the hospital administration honored his request for more than a month. Battle is now filing for “compensatory damages for the emotional stress and harm to her reputation,” according to The Huffington Post.
The hospital’s response? A “no comment” statement.
There have been strong reactions on both sides. The supporters of the hospital’s initial decision claim a right to prudence — that it was defusing the situation from escalating to dangerous heights. What if the man had been violent about a denial of request? Shouldn’t the hospital’s security and the patient, as well as employee rights, be a priority?
Despite the unequivocal “yes” to both questions, that does not merit such an allowance of blatant racism.
Some have also criticized the suit, saying that it is a matter of principle regarding patient preferences more than the pure issue of race. But the hospital should have acted with integrity and simply said no to such an obvious form of discrimination.
According to several sources, the note that Battle found on her clipboard the morning after the request said that no African Americans to tend to the baby — a direct attack on race and not on an issue with character or conduct, which are legitimate concerns when assessing an employee. It was a man taking issue with a caregiver’s skin color. It was a direct attack on the hospital’s own employee, and yet the hospital honored it.
Though the decision to grant the request can easily be portrayed as a decision made with ultimate consideration for the patient, when such deep personal offense is taken to account it becomes a bigger issue altogether. According to court documents, Battle “was in disbelief
that she was so egregiously discriminated against based on her race and re-assigned.”
Yes, it is legal for a patient to request specific professionals for treatment, but when it infringes upon someone’s right to be treated as an equal human being, that’s taking it too far. Even if it wasn’t a request to drop Battle’s duties as a nurse, the reassignment on racial grounds cannot be taken lightly — legally, or more importantly, ethically. Hurley Medical is not only charged with the responsibility of following the Constitution as a public hospital but also to treat all employees with respect and dignity. It’s clear that it failed to do so in this situation.
An event such as this seems shocking in this day and age; in Battle’s past 25 years working for the hospital, she did not contend with such an issue. But without a doubt, this won’t be the last time a case like this appears.
Hopefully, the lawsuit’s outcome will give hope to a future beyond racism and the willingness to acquiesce to it. One can only wish that this game of one-step-forward,   two-steps-back meets its end soon.

I felt that the cartoon was more offensive than the grammar in the article or is that just me?
I find it hard to believe that you’re majoring in both BISC and English. Your op-ed contains numerous grammatical errors and your understanding of how health care is delivered is naive. Patient autonomy comes first; doctors merely provide a service. If you are interested in medicine, I would hope that you study harder during your time at USC.

On Monday night, the Department of Public Safety at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs posted a list of 10 tips to help female students defend themselves against rapists. These “tips” have created a large debate as it includes controversial advice to female students such as informing their attacker “that you have a disease or are menstruating,” and, “Vomiting or urinating may also convince the attacker to leave you alone.”
Other tips include, “passive resistance may be your best defense,” and, “understand that some actions on your part might lead to more harm.”
First, telling a girl that her actions may lead her to more harm insinuates that she is somehow at fault for being a victim of rape. It is never the victim’s fault. Second, “passive resistance?” So, if a woman is about to be raped, she should subtly decline? “Excuse me, sir, I don’t have time for this.”  That’ll get things done.
These tips immediately victimize females before they actually become victims. At the point in time where a girl would have to employ these tactics, is the cause not already lost? The goal should be to prevent rape altogether, not stop an attack once it’s started. These suggestions assumes a woman is already in a situation of danger, and while it’s perfectly valid for women to have some self-defense tactics under the wing, “passive resistance” achieves the opposite effect.
A “top 10 tips on how to stay safe and aware of your surroundings” or “top 10 reasons to not rape (for men)” would do a lot more justice and help make progress toward keeping females out of danger and subsequent emotional trauma.
Katie Chen is a freshman studying Business Administration.
 
I think you’re missing the point of the suggestions, Katie. No one is ever assuming that a woman is ever at fault in these circumstances, but these are some guidelines for ways to stay safe if the worst of the worst should arise. Also I think your “Top 10 reasons not to rape (for men)” would be about as effective as “top 10 reasons not to kill (for crazy people)”
Hopefully you’d never have to use these tactics, but in the off-chance that you do…now you know

The USC women’s tennis team returned to action on Tuesday with a rousing victory over visiting San Diego State.
The Women of Troy, who entered the matchup ranked No. 6 in the nation, showed no signs of rust after a weeklong break from competition, thoroughly dominating the Aztecs on their way to a 7-0 victory.
USC was on point throughout the match, beginning with doubles play. The first victory of the day came courtesy of the pairing of sophomores Gabriella DeSimone and Giuliana Olmos. The duo opened up with an 8-0 thrashing of their opponents and, with that, opened the floodgates for a dominating afternoon for the Women of Troy. Following that victory, USC’s top pairing of junior Kaitlyn Christian and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria clinched the team’s first point, winning 8-2 on court one. It was the first match that the two have played since being ranked as the top doubles team in the country in the most recent round of ITA national rankings.
Santamaria also was ranked as the top singles player in the nation, and she continued her season-long dominance against the Aztecs, starting off singles play with a 6-2, 6-0 win against Julia Wais. Christian followed that win with a near-perfect 6-0, 6-1 victory on court five. With the count standing at 3-0 in favor of the Trojans, DeSimone was next to claim a point, and in doing so clinched the match for the Women of Troy, winning 6-0, 6-2 on court three. Following her triumph, newcomer Ellie Yates and Olmos were next to clinch with 6-0, 6-3 and 6-3, 6-2 victories, respectively. Last to finish was senior Danielle Lao. Lao entered the match ranked third in the nation in singles play and did nothing to hurt that mark, winning 6-1, 6-3 on court two and capping off a 7-0 victory for the Trojans.
The win on Tuesday left the Trojans standing 8-1 overall (the lone loss being at the hands of No. 8 ranked North Carolina at the ITAs), and 5-0 at Marks Stadium. The Women of Troy will now look to their rematch against Cal this weekend in Berkeley. The two teams first met a little under two weeks ago in the consolation round at the ITA National Team Indoor championships. Following a trend this season, Lao and Santamaria led the way in that matchup, both defeating top-10 opponents en route to a 4-1 victory for the Trojans.
Following the match against Cal, the Women of Troy will travel to San Diego and UCLA before returning to home action on March 12 against Texas.
