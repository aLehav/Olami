Renowned architect Lorcan O’Herlihy speaks with students and faculty at a lecture on Wednesday. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
In a lecture at Watt Hall Wednesday, renowned architect and adjunct professor Lorcan O’Herlihy spoke about his exhibition “Amplified Urbanism” at the Harris Building in downtown Los Angeles. USC adjunct professor Lawrence Scarpa delivered introductory remarks, acknowledging O’Herlihy’s award-winning architecture and design company, Lorcan O’Herlihy Architects, for completing over 100 projects across multiple continents. 
“[O’Herlihy] advances the tenants of modernism in unexpected and provocative ways,” Scarpa said, attributing O’Herlihy’s success to his ruthless optimism. “[This success] is contextual and civic-minded, but not commonplace. It inspires hope and optimism, but it is not wishful thinking.”
Upon taking the podium, O’Herlihy credited his childhood love for cities like Rome and London as the reason he became an architect. Growing up in Dublin, O’Herlihy said his father’s career as a film actor allowed him to travel the world. 
“Sometimes it’s really about where you come from or what you like personally,” O’Herlihy said. 
After settling on the East Coast for eight years to work for Kevin Roche and Steven Holl, among others, O’Herlihy took on the project of designing the Louvre Museum in Paris. Several years later, he moved to New York to immerse himself in the ’80s contemporary art scene where he briefly pursued a career as a painter, a phase he said was very formative in his architectural career. 
O’Herlihy then went on to discuss several urban projects he’s pioneered over the last several years, but prefaced this with the philosophies he always applies to his projects.
“I believe that architecture is a social act,” O’Herlihy said. “It’s not so much about how to design a building as an object, but how to use architecture as a tool for gauging its politics.”
He acknowledged the inevitable complexities that confront an architect working with urban landscapes and said that the density of cities, particularly Los Angeles, encourages him to design spaces that foster human interaction by utilizing “dynamic solutions.” 
O’Herlihy cited the current digital climate as another major challenge for architects — he believes that social media is a public space. Because of this, he seeks to foster a “third space,” which he views as connective tissue between the private and public spheres.
“With that in mind though, we are being isolated by those very tools,” O’Herlihy said. “It is more critical than ever to design spaces that bring us together.” 
O’Herlihy went on to discuss some of his firm’s past and current projects, which he said exemplify the concept of “advanced urbanism” after which his book and exhibit are named. The goal of the book, according to a wall text in the exhibition, “was to provoke conversations about how cities can become more dynamic, sustainable and productive environments for all.”
“It should be across the board … it doesn’t matter where the resources are,” O’Herlihy said.
Throughout the lecture, O’Herlihy emphasized that he views projects through social, artistic, political and economic lenses. 
“These things — embrace them with ruthless optimism, and hopefully that will happen to produce greater architecture,” O’Herlihy said. “And that’s what we’re trying to do.” 
Following the lecture and subsequent Q&A session, attendees moved to the Verle Annis Gallery to enjoy refreshments and view the exhibition, which will be on display until Nov. 16.

Françoise Mouly is the art editor for The New Yorker. (Photo courtesy of Sarah Shatz)
Cartoonist Art Spiegelman has always had a talent for merging the political and the personal. 
His Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel “Maus: A Survivor’s Tale” wove his childhood memories with war-torn Germany in its charged retelling of his father’s experience as a Holocaust survivor. Spiegelman and his wife Françoise Mouly, the art editor for The New Yorker, spoke about the responsibilities of artists in the current political moment at Bovard Auditorium Thursday. 
The Daily Trojan caught up with Spiegelman prior to the event to talk comics, culture and what creativity may mean for posterity. 
“I was lucky enough to be born at a moment when it was possible to make comics as a medium of self expression rather than just as part of an industry,” Spiegelman said over the phone from his New York studio on Tuesday. “I just thought of [drawing] when I was 11 years old. When Samuel Beckett was asked why he became a writer he answered, ‘Not suited for anything else.’ I guess that hit at 11 and never quite changed.” 
From there, Spiegelman began publishing his own purple-ink Mad-esque comic, “Blasé,” which launched him into the underground comix scene.
“I first went to the newly launched East Village Other because the cartoons they had were pretty awful, and I thought I could do something slightly better or just as awful,” he said. “The editor Walter Boward nodded and said, ‘Could you give us more stuff with sex and drugs?’”
Luckily, Spiegelman’s career at the East Village Other swerved swiftly around his parents’ wish that he become a dentist. “[My father] explained that ‘You know in Auschwitz even dentists were doctors?’ It was an attempt to get me in a better position to survive,” he said. 
Spiegelman also shared his gritty trail to success in the art world with Mouly. 
Before she became The New Yorker’s art editor, Mouly worked a number of odd jobs in New York after moving from Paris, where she was studying architecture at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts. Their romance began over dinner when Mouly forgot her wallet and insisted on paying Spiegelman back. Soon, the pair was spending Thanksgiving together at a Chinese restaurant. 
“At some point I asked her, ‘So what are your plans for Thanksgiving?’ and she said, ‘Thanksgiving? What is that?’ To which I said, ‘It’s a night when people go out to Chinese restaurants, could I take you?’” 
Their romance soon morphed into mutual inspiration and they began co-editing the comic magazine Raw, despite Spiegelman’s vow to never edit again after his stressful stint editing Arcade, the underground comix magazine he founded with Bill Griffith.
Though much of Spiegelman’s work since “Maus” can be said to more closely resemble his underground comix days, the cartoonist said he cannot help but return to “Maus” and what it represents in light of our current political moment. 
“I couldn’t have dreamed of how overtly authoritarian and fascist the future can look some days and as a result it has made me look back on my own work differently,” Spiegelman said. “When I made ‘Maus’ it wasn’t about wanting to make the world better; it wasn’t about anything but wanting to tell a story.”
On the Tuesday of midterm elections, Spiegelman speculated what sort of drinks they would serve after his talk at USC: “We should ask to serve champagne or perhaps cyanide which is most likely from the vantage point in this current moment, or perhaps just flat beer.”
Wearing his politics on his sleeve, Spiegelman is also the hand behind some of The New Yorker’s most controversial covers, including the Feb. 15, 1992 issue, which features a Hasidic man kissing a black woman, and a 1998 issue, depicting a construction worker breastfeeding her baby while seated on a scaffolding. 
Acutely aware of the power comics hold to bring about messages of social change, Spiegelman is also conscious to the art form’s misuses: “Comics are thriving and [comics] have proved themselves to be good at lots of things. One thing being making art I suppose, but more obvious in more recent decades, it’s used to amuse and entertain but also to spread the most vile propaganda possible.” 
When asked about whether the responsibility of artists presently carries more weight, Spiegelman paused. 
“I don’t think any artist should do anything,” he finally said. “Because some people are better at adjusting colors … Others who can [participate] certainly should be.” 
Yet, Spiegelman remains hopeful about the future of young artists and the roles they will someday play in determining and interpreting national moments. 
“Every artwork is a response to other works of art, as well as a way of reporting what it is you feel,” he said. “[Young artists should] stick with it. It’s not something that happens in a day.”

“RuPaul’s Drag Race” has produced 10 winners and a spinoff “All-Stars” series. (Photo from VH1)
Nine years ago, RuPaul Charles launched his conquest to bring drag performance into the mainstream with “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” a campy reality competition show loosely modeled after “America’s Next Top Model.” Even in its humble beginnings, “Drag Race” was destined for success. It had every element necessary to become a household name on primetime television — memeable one-liners, wig-snatching glamour, tea-spilling drama and iconic personalities. It was the perfect recipe to gain a cult following. From there, a star was born — actually, many glittery, gay stars. 
Fast forward to 2018 and the show has exploded into a global phenomenon. From winning big at the Primetime Emmys to prompting events such as DragCon, there is no doubt that RuPaul has created an empire of drag queens and millions of fans around the world. And while it has been criticized for implicit racial biases and pigeonholing practices of drag and femininity, “RuPaul’s Drag Race” has also made undeniable contributions that have transformed both drag and the LGBTQ community for the better.
Now approaching its 11th season and 10th year on air, “Drag Race” has become one of the most progressive shows on American television, exposing the rest of the world to queer culture in ways unimaginable since Showtime’s “Queer as Folk” and “The L Word.” An established cultural institution with over 100 alumni, the series has also become a vibrant relic of popular culture. 
In many respects, “RuPaul’s Drag Race” is all about questioning gender and identity. In its nine-year history, the series has documented queer representation and reflected the ever-evolving state of the queer community. And, prior to the show, the dominant image of the drag queen was often hyperfeminized, but the self-expressions of the contestants helped humanize the queer experience.
In the first episode of season four, however, drag witnessed a radical shift with Sharon Needles, who shocked viewers as she strutted down the runway as a post-apocalyptic zombie spewing blood from her mouth. 
RuPaul interjected a signature witty comment: “Gingivitis never looked so good.”
After Sharon Needles’s coronation, it was evident that drag as an art form could no longer be boxed or confined to glittery gowns or pastel-colored wigs — creativity became limitless, whether it be through fashion or comedy or lip-syncing. By that point, “Drag Race” mobilized a new generation of drag queens. Bianca Del Rio graced season six with her crude, deprecating humor; Alyssa Edwards amassed thousands of fans for her hilarious one-liners and ridiculous dance moves; and Shangela took her talent from reality TV to the silver screen through “A Star is Born” with season four alumna Willam Belli.
It goes without saying that icons like Lady Bunny, Divine and Leigh Bowery transformed the world of queer performance art. However, it was RuPaul who took drag to the next level by putting it on America’s biggest platform, flipping off cisgender heteronormativity with a big, bold — and bedazzled — middle finger. It was this simple concept that allowed drag queens to finally rise to prominence in today’s LGBTQ community. 
Take Ongina, who became the first contestant to talk about her HIV-positive status on national television in season one. Or Kim Chi, who embraced the intersectionality of being a queer Korean American through her drag in season eight. Or Sonique and Peppermint, who both publicly came out as transgender during their respective seasons. Or Trinity Taylor and Cynthia Lee Fontaine, who told their stories about performing at Pulse nightclub prior to the mass shooting that took 49 lives in 2016.
“Drag Race” and its contestants have become a voicebox for the queer community. From exposing people’s perception of transgender performers (whether it be positive or negative) to recounting the lived and shared experiences of its queer cast, the hit TV show always displays a willingness to dive deep into sensitive issues, thereby disrupting cultural norms in giving its queens careers, voices and platforms (higher than six-inch stilettos) for political expression.
Drag is no longer just one out of a 100 stitches in the LGBTQ tapestry, and it is no longer restricted to Bingo nights at gay bars on Sunset Strip or The Castro. “RuPaul’s Drag Race” allows its contestants to sparkle, dazzle and “sissy that walk” onto the main stage of entertainment. Beyond this, it has also shed new light on what inclusion and diversity mean for queer people, all while becoming a multimillion-dollar enterprise. And it’s not slowing down anytime soon.
Fellow queer Trojans: If you have never witnessed the magic of a drag performance, come out to the Queer and Ally Student Assembly’s ninth annual Drag Show Friday night at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center ballroom to support local USC drag queens. Shangela’s hosting, in case you needed any more incentive. And remember: “If you can’t love yourself, how in the hell [are] you gonna love somebody else?!”

The star-studded cast of “Avengers: Infinity War” features actors such as Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo. (Photo from IMDb)
As the lights dimmed in the Ray Stark Family Theater Wednesday, chatter faded away and all eyes were glued to the screen for two and a half hours of action and epic storytelling. Following a screening of the “Avengers: Infinity War,” the School of Cinematic Arts hosted a Q&A session with writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.
 The pair has also worked on many other Marvel favorites including all three “Captain America” films, “Thor: The Dark World” and the short-lived “Agent Carter” television series. Markus and McFeely got their start with the popular television film “The Life and Death of Peter Sellers,” for which they won an Emmy Award.
As the signature Marvel Cinematic Universe post-credits scene rolled, Markus and McFeely proceeded to the front of the room. The filmmakers first joked about their writing process and said they began by “writing down the names of everyone in the MCU and sticking them to the wall.” They discussed the rudimentary yet organic ways the story came to life, as well as how Marvel Studios creates original stories by taking ingredients from the comics and giving writers free rein over the direction of the franchise.
Markus and McFeely started their Marvel careers when they came together to write the first “Captain America” film. Having just left the “Narnia” franchise over a writers’ strike, the two wanted to do something new.
“We pitched for it for months … we even gave Kevin [Feige] money,” McFeely said. 
When they eventually got the film, they had the difficult job of making Captain America seem “cool” for a modern audience. 
According to Markus and McFeely, they worked well with directors Anthony and Joe Russo. No one claimed stake over the work, but they did joke about their initial skepticism over the choice of directors.
“The guys from television comedy — yeah good choice,” Markus said. That skepticism quickly disappeared when the Russo brothers filmed the elevator fight sequence in “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” in the first four days of production. 
Before “Civil War” wrapped up, the Russo brothers approached Markus and McFeely about writing the next Avengers films: “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers 4.” Upon accepting the offer, the two spent four months workshopping the basic plot and writing the two scripts, which they turned in one week apart. 
On the topic of fake scripts, the two discussed how each of the film’s departments received altered versions of the scripts to avoid spoilers. In one funny case, the props department was not aware theirs was a decoy, so the crew brought six bananas instead of infinity stones to set.
As the Q&A session came to an end, the writers shared some tidbits on how “Avengers 4” will be connected to yet separate from “Avengers: Infinity War.”
Markus and McFeely also described writing the character of Captain America in “Avengers 4” as a difficult process because it was the first time they held him back. The two writers also hinted that the impact of the story’s failure on these heroes may not necessarily be traditional growths or anything good in “Avengers 4.” And they made sure to mention the status of Marvel’s beloved fallen heroes: “Dead is dead.”

The two top-ranked men’s water polo teams in the country will face off in one of the biggest rivalry matchups in college water polo on Saturday as No. 1 USC will host No. 2 UCLA at Uytengsu Aquatics Center at 3 p.m.
After dominating Cal 13-7 and UC Irvine 15-5 last weekend, the Trojans enter this match with a 27-1 record, and the Bruins enter with a 20-2 record. Both teams are undefeated at home.
This weekend’s rivalry matchups — USC-UCLA and Cal-Stanford — will determine the seedings for the upcoming Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament. Both USC and UCLA are 1-1 in MPSF Tournament play this season. But it will not be enough for USC to come out with a victory over UCLA. The Trojans will also need a Cal victory to claim the top seed in the upcoming tournament. 
“We have big history against [UCLA] but our two games last weekend gave us some confidence,” junior driver Marin Dasic said. “We don’t want to have too much confidence; we still have to work because they are a very dangerous team, and they can surprise us in any aspect.”
Sophomore attacker Nicolas Saveljic leads the Bruins in scoring with 38 goals this season. Redshirt junior goalie Alex Wolf anchors the defense with an average of 9.9 saves per game. 
Sophomore drivers Marko Vavic with 55 goals and Jacob Mercep with 53 goals lead the offense for the Trojans. Eighteen Trojans have scored in games this season, with freshman driver Hannes Daube, senior driver Zach D’Sa, junior 2-meter Matt Maier, redshirt junior driver Daniel Leong and Dasic all leading scorers.
Freshman goalies Nic Porter and Sam Krutong anchor the defense with 9.83 saves per game and 9.27 saves per game, respectively, as well as sophomore transfer goalie Vaios Vlahotasios, who is averaging of 9.31 saves per game. 
“Defense is always our primary thing to work on and the thing we have to focus on the most,” Dasic said. “But [UCLA] is a great defensive team too, so we are also working on our offense and trying to figure out how we’ll beat them.” 
USC leads 68-57-1 all-time in the series, which dates back to 1962. The Trojans seek redemption after falling to the Bruins 7-5 in both last year’s MPSF Tournament championship match and national championship game. 
Heading into the matchup, the Trojans are looking to continue the positive team dynamic they had in their games last weekend. 
“We played the game unselfishly, and we really played a game where all of us contributed equally,” Dasic said. 
The Trojans have also been working to improve team chemistry over the course of the season.
“It will be a huge aspect that we all have to be aware of,” Dasic said. “We have great chemistry between each other, and we believe in each other. I think we can be unstoppable, but we also have to be really aware of other teams and their capabilities.”
USC anticipates a large, vocal crowd Saturday afternoon. 
“All of the support is really greatly appreciated by all of us, and it definitely pumps us up before and during the game,” Maier said.
Graduating Trojans D’Sa and Leong will be honored in a Senior Day pregame ceremony, as Saturday marks USC’s last home game of the regular season. Tip off will take place at 3 p.m. and will be broadcast on Pac-12 Los Angeles.

Freshman guard Kevin Porter looks for a pass against Robert Morris Tuesday. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The men’s basketball team looks to start its season 2-0 when they play  Vanderbilt University at the Galen Center on Sunday. The Commodores finished near the bottom of the Southeastern Conference last season with a 12-20 record, but they seem poised for a bounce-back effort.
Vanderbilt is 1-0 after defeating Winthrop 92-79 at home on Tuesday. The Commodores played a well-rounded offensive game, shooting over 50 percent from the field, making 10 3-pointers and shooting 20 free throws.
“To have a chance to defeat a very good team like Vanderbilt we have to defend at a high level, limit second shots and then we have to get out in transition ourselves,” head coach Andy Enfield said.
Enfield listed athleticism, agility and 3-point shooting as the Commodores’ strengths.
“They’re a different team than they were last year,” Enfield said of Vanderbilt, who the Trojans defeated 93-89 in overtime a season ago. “They’re younger, but they’re much more athletic and fast.”
Vanderbilt was led by two five-star freshmen in guard Darius Garland and center Simisola Shittu. Garland shot 9-of-15 from the floor and 3-of-7 from 3-point distance to lead the team in scoring with 24 points while adding four assists. Shittu was a strong inside presence, racking up 18 points and 10 rebounds while shooting 6-of-12 from the field and 6-of-9 from the free throw line.
Garland and Shittu, along with four-star forward Aaron Nesmith, make up one of the best recruiting classes in Vanderbilt’s history. The Trojans will have to key in on this group that ranked as the No. 13 recruiting class in the nation this season. Enfield emphasized the players’ athleticism and offensive aggression.
Redshirt junior forward Matt Ryan also presents the Trojans with issues. At 6-foot-8 and 209 pounds, Ryan has the height to survive as a big man and the shooting stroke to punish slower defenders, as evidenced by his 4-of-11 mark from long range against Winthrop. Ryan demonstrated his propensity to get hot by making three straight 3s in the first half. He could be a problem for Trojan big men junior Nick Rakocevic and sophomore Victor Uyaelunmo.
“They’re a great 3-point shooting team,” Aaron said. “Keeping them off, running guys off the 3-point line, and just playing [defense].”
The Trojans battled through a slow start to defeat Robert Morris 83-62 on Tuesday and open their campaign with a win. After a stagnant offense and inconsistent defense led to a 4-point deficit in the second half, the Trojans finished the frame on a 34-9 run with improved cohesion and ball movement.
“Our team is still a work in progress. We have two key players who are injured, and we have a lot of players who are trying to get a feel for their role on the team, as well as to learn our system, especially some of the younger players,” Enfield said. “So our veterans did a great job helping us to win this game, but we’re going to need everybody as we move forward to improve.”
On the injury front, Enfield listed senior forward Bennie Boatwright as day-to-day as he continues to recover from his knee injury. Freshman guard Elijah Weaver practiced for the first time since August on Thursday, and Enfield also listed him as day-to-day.
The Trojans already have a star freshman in guard Kevin Porter, who contributed 15 points and five rebounds on 6-of-7 shooting against the Colonials. Even as the team was struggling to get good looks, Porter showcased his ability to create shots in isolation opportunities, a key trait for this team’s potential.
“He’s incredible. He’s got the whole package,” Rakocevic said of Porter. “He’s a ball-handler, he can shoot it, he’s got a 45-inch vertical, maybe higher. He’s fast, he’s quick, he can play defense. I think he’s a big part of our team this year.”
This will be an interesting test for the Trojans in the early season. It’s too soon to know how impressive an opponent Vanderbilt is, but the Commodores certainly have talent. USC will need to play much more like the team fans saw in the second half against Robert Morris than the first half version if it wants to come away victorious.
“I’m not really worried about [the game],” Rakocevic said. “We have guys who like working hard, things like that, playing defense. If we can just focus on playing defense, running the floor and doing the little things that we do we’re going to be a really good team.”
The Trojans tip off against the Commodores at the Galen Center at 6 p.m.  Sunday.

Senior guard Mariya Moore prepares to shoot against UC Riverside. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Following a victory in its home opener against UC Riverside on Tuesday, the women’s basketball team will play Long Beach State on Sunday.
The Trojans have won their last eight games against Long Beach State, which leads the all-time series record, 28-24.
Against UC Riverside, junior guard Minyon Moore led the team with 16 points, 12 points and seven assists, and will be a contributing factor against the 49ers.
Moore emphasized key parts of her game that — with practice — will improve the team throughout the season.
“Less turnovers and being a good passer to my shooters,” she said after Tuesday’s victory.
Transfers Cydnee Kinslow, Sydney Boronaro and Justina King that will be making their debut for Long Beach State against the Trojans, after a home opener on Friday against Cal Baptist.
First-year head coach Jeff Cammon leads the 49ers. Cammon has taken over a program that was 8-23 overall and 6-10 in the Big West, having lost in the first round of the Big West Tournament to UC Riverside. 
This is head coach Mark Trakh’s second year leading the Women of Troy. The Trojans were 20-11 and 9-9 in Pac-12 play, but the team’s season ended in the first round of the 2018 Pac-12 tournament after a loss to Cal.
After the win against the Highlanders, Trakh applauded his players’ effort, but cautioned that the team needs to continue building chemistry. 
“We’ve got to get better,” Trakh said.  “We’re trying to fit new pieces together. It will be a process, and the kids have to stay patient through the process.”
One of the essential components of building chemistry is improving defense, Moore said after the win on Tuesday.
“It’s a new group so sometimes you try to help too much [on defense],” Moore said. “We just have to keep our man in front of us. That’s what we’re taught in practice.”
With a number of new transfers coming into the season, Trakh continued to embrace experimentation with lineups to allow the players to grow together.
 “You’ve got to experiment and see who can do what and [which] combinations fit together,” Trakh said. “Experience is big in this. We have to get them where we get them experience and get them playing together.”
After losing leading scorer Kristen Simon to graduation, the Trojans will rely on upperclassman Aliyah Mazyck and transfers Cheyanne Wallace, Kayla Overbeck and Mariya Moore. 
Though Mazyck did not play the home opener for undisclosed reasons, Trakh praised the senior guard as one of the “best players in the Pac-12.” Mazyck is USC’s all-time leader in 3-pointers made in a season, a feat she accomplished last season with 86 in 31 games.
Mariya Moore, a senior and the older sister of sophomore Minyon Moore, was the Trojans’ second leading scorer against UC Riverside with 11 points, five assists and two rebounds.
“It’s good,” Minyon Moore said about playing her first collegiate game with her sister Mariya, who transferred from the University of Louisville at the end of the 2016-17 season. “It’s not really anything different; we’ve always played with each other.”
Mariya Moore averaged 12 points, 5.1 rebounds and 4.9 assists in her final season with the Cardinals, helping them advance to the Sweet Sixteen in 2017.
 “These two are going to have a good year,” Trakh said.
The 49ers’ leading scorer is guard Shanaijah Davison, who led LBSU with 13.8 points a game and was a member of the Big West All-Freshman team.
The two unranked teams will face off in Walter Pyramid at 2 p.m. Sunday.

Freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown looks to dodge a receiver as he runs to the end zone. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
With the end of the season nearing and barely a shot at a Pac-12 title or a major bowl, head coach Clay Helton and the Trojans will look to find an identity to hold onto heading towards the offseason. 
The transfer of play-calling duties to Helton early last week signaled a major shift in the team’s direction. The team’s first effort under the full offensive direction of Helton resulted in a win last weekend against last place Oregon State, although the victory may have come with more trouble than initially expected. 
They’ll face a tougher opponent in Cal with the same 5-4 record, coming off of a tough 19-13 loss to No. 8 ranked Washington State. This week’s matchup will establish whether or not this Trojan team has a direction moving forward.
USC offense vs. Cal defense
The defense, led by Bears head coach and former USC defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox, is a stingy if inconsistent unit. At its best, the Cal defense is dominant, and recently that’s the way it has looked, holding Washington and Washington State to 10 and 19 points, respectively, in back-to-back weeks. 
They’ve been especially impressive in pass coverage, with a secondary featuring redshirt sophomore cornerback Camryn Bynum and redshirt junior safety Ashtyn Davis that has held Washington quarterback Jake Browning and Washington State quarterback Gardner Minshew to only two combined touchdowns while snagging three interceptions. 
Junior linebacker Evan Weaver is also a force on the defensive side of the ball for the Bears, finding a way to involve himself on almost every snap — evidenced by his 94 tackles, two interceptions and six passes defended on the year. 
“They’re doing a nice job of mixing up coverages and they hide their coverages extremely well,” Helton said.
This unit will provide Clay Helton with his first real offensive play-calling test as the Trojans come off their win against Oregon State. The game plan last week unleashed the run, spearheaded by senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware, who rushed for a career-high 205 yards and three touchdowns. 
With the strength of the Bears’ pass defense and junior receiver Michael Pittman out this week with a shoulder injury, don’t be surprised to see the Trojans try to replicate that success on the ground once again. 
Between Ware and redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai (sophomore Stephen Carr is out with an ankle injury), the Trojans will likely try to pound the ball down the throat of the Cal defense. 
However, don’t expect them to shy away from taking big shots downfield in the passing game — that has been the bread and butter of USC’s offense this season. The emergence of freshman receiver Devon Williams last week after Pittman’s injury was huge. Between Williams’ play, redshirt sophomore receiver Tyler Vaughns and the re-emergence of a healthy freshman receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, freshman quarterback JT Daniels will have plenty of options to stretch the field with. 
“With [Pittman] out, [Williams] is going to garner reps again,” Helton said. “He is a huge target and an explosive weapon.”
Cal offense vs. USC defense
The Cal offense is much less imposing than the group they have on the other side of the ball. Ranked at No. 83, it is one of the least explosive in the country, one spot above that of USC. 
Redshirt senior running back Patrick Laird is Cal’s biggest playmaker, with 950 scrimmage yards and eight touchdowns on the season, but on 4.4 yards per carry. The run defense shut down the Pac-12’s leading rusher last week in Oregon State’s Jermar Jefferson. The defense shouldn’t have much trouble containing the ground game if it stays disciplined in its lane assignments this week. 
The fact that Cal’s passing offense won’t provide much to worry about will help USC. The Bears have thrown 13 interceptions to 12 touchdowns on the year, averaging only 205 passing yards per game. At quarterback, they’ve rotated redshirt freshman Chase Garbers and redshirt sophomore Brandon McIlwain, and it remains unclear who will receive a majority of the playing time Saturday. Between the two, Garbers may seem to be the more dangerous option. He’s been solid at avoiding turnovers and has shown a strong ability to run the ball when needed.
The Trojans are lucky to be playing an opponent so unspectacular through the air this week, as they could be missing their only consistent cornerback in senior Iman Marshall on Saturday. The secondary has struggled all year, with Marshall as one of its only bright spots. He has played the best season of his career, contributing five tackles against Oregon State. Marshall practiced on Thursday and will be a gametime decision. The matchup against the Cal offense will allow for the secondary  to catch its breath and perhaps leave room for young playmakers to take a step forward. 
“[Marshall] is having an All-American season, that’s my opinion,” Helton said. “I think when you look at him going up against some of the best wideouts in the country, he’s not only held his own but held them way below what they usually do. He’s been a major rock of that defense.”
Don’t be surprised to see freshman corner Olaijah Griffin get significant playing time with Marshall’s injury and recovery from a shoulder issue.
“This time of the year the games are critical,” Helton said. “This is one that can help us stay at the top of Pac-12 South and keep us on contention. I think everyone understands how valuable this game is.”
Prediction: 28-10, USC
Expect this to be the first game in a long time that the Trojans look good from start to finish. Defensively, they should have no problems limiting the mediocre Bears offense, despite their weaknesses.
Washington State managed to hold them to 10 points last week. The sledding won’t be as easy on the other side of the ball, as the Cal defense is no joke. But the time of possession battle will greatly favor USC and wear down the Bears as the game goes on. If the Trojans’ newfound run game can put on a performance anything similar to last week, it’ll put enough points on the board to put this game/match away handily.

If I had a nickel every time I was asked, ‘When is [head coach Clay] Helton going to get fired?’ I would have a lot of nickels. The question is almost never “will” Helton get fired, and for a while, I was confused why USC fans and alumni were so trigger-happy. 
I have spent the better part of 20 years as a Detroit sports fan. I have seen really bad teams (I’m looking at you, 2008 Lions), I have seen poor coaching and I have seen frustrated fans. We have had our fair share of horrendous coaches as well.
There is a major difference between USC and the abysmal teams I grew up supporting: USC fans can’t handle losing. USC has a winning culture. There are a lot of fair-weather fans and that’s a problem.
I completely understand the desire for fans to call for Helton’s firing. He is the figurehead of this loaded team, and he has a wealth of talent at his fingertips. USC has the potential to be the best team in the Pac-12 and compete with the likes of Michigan and Texas, but you have to step back for a second and look at everything Helton has had to deal with in 2018.
For one, he has a true freshman quarterback in JT Daniels; while I recognize Helton and his staff should have brought him up to speed, inexperience is still a factor. 
The second thing is the injuries. The roster looks almost nothing like it did at the beginning of the season. The Trojans have lost so many impact players. Senior captain linebackers Cam Smith and Porter Gustin have missed significant time this season due to injuries, yet I must applaud the coaching staff and players for filling in those spots.
Then there’s the safety position. I don’t think I have ever seen a team lose so many players in a single position. Sophomore Bubba Bolden was supposed to start this season, but he was removed from the team following an incident. Then fill-in redshirt freshman Isaiah Pola-Mao suffered a shoulder injury, which was followed up by senior Marvell Tell missing time. This string of events was recently capped off with the loss of freshman Talonoa Hufanga for the season due to a broken collarbone.
But the loss of players doesn’t stop with the linebackers and safeties. Senior cornerback Iman Marshall will miss time following a couple lower leg injuries, and redshirt freshman cornerback Greg Johnson may miss time with a shoulder injury.
Even in this time of peril, the defense has remained the most solid component of USC’s play. Game after game, the defense holds USC’s inconsistent offense in the game for as long as possible. 
As of now, I am not on the “fire Helton” train. I think it’s imperative to give him more time. I don’t think we have seen him demonstrate his coaching ability yet, and that takes time.
Before coming to USC, I was a Michigan fan. In a lot of ways, the Trojans are similar to the Wolverines. Both schools have a rich football history with die-hard fans and alumni. Both schools have a fantastic football culture encapsulated by massive, historic stadiums. 
Michigan has been a football powerhouse for many decades, and the fans really do not like losing. The school fostered some of the NFL’s best athletes in Tom Brady, Charles Woodson and Desmond Howard. But the Wolverines were down in the dumps in the Rich Rodriguez and Brady Hoke eras. In walked Jim Harbaugh in 2015 and he was touted as the savior of Michigan football, and although the team vastly improved, the lofty results fans had hoped for didn’t show, especially last season. Four seasons in, Harbaugh has elevated the Wolverines into College Football Playoff picture.
But coaching a football team takes time. Helton is still a fresh head coach; he has only been at the helm of USC since 2015 and has had to deal with many obstacles.
The Trojans’ final two Pac-12 matchups will serve as a litmus test for how Helton can band this broken team together, but by no means should they serve as grounds for his firing. The sample size is not big enough for Athletic Director Lynn Swann to pull the plug on Helton, not to mention the high-profile bowl game finishes of the last two seasons. One season should not define Helton’s coaching ability — especially one full of injuries, young talent and coaching changes.
The Detroit Red Wings taught me love, the Detroit Lions taught me pain and I am hoping that Helton and the Trojans can teach me patience.

It’s a difficult time to be a young person in America, but Tuesday night — election night — gave us hope. 
Americans under the age of 30 registered and voted in droves, pushing through progressive policies, flipping state legislatures and changing the party makeup of the U.S. House of Representatives. Studies project that it was the highest youth turnout in decades, and after two bleak years, it felt like political progress was within reach. 
But then, on Wednesday night, 12 people, including college students and a law enforcement officer, were gunned down in Thousand Oaks, a city only 40 miles from campus. It seemed that just when we thought that our voices had been heard and the world was getting better for young people, the illusion was violently pierced with a spray of bullets. While our hearts go out to those affected, we also must see this needless shooting as the reminder that it is: There is so much more political work that must be done in this country. 
First, we should celebrate the positives. According to early CNN reports, 1 in 6 midterm ballots were cast by first-time voters, and almost half of these first time voters are under the age of 30, according to CBS. A survey from Harvard University Institute of 
Politics showed that 40 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds stated their definite intent to vote, heralding a significant increase from 2010 and 2014 midterm turnouts. 
Across campus, at all levels and for months, we have seen burgeoning political activism at USC. VoteSC signed up an estimated 2,000 student voters, including 500 at a National Voter Registration Day drive, a marked increase from the 411 students registered in 2016. The Political Student Assembly, Trojan Advocates for Political Progress, Undergraduate Student Government and Unruh Associates, among other student organizations, worked tirelessly to encourage political participation and make voting more accessible to students. 
From canvassing in nearby districts to tabling on Trousdale Parkway, the actions of these student groups exemplified productive political engagement and encouraged all students to mobilize for the causes they believe in.
Culminating on Tuesday night, myriad campus events — including the election night viewing party Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism held in partnership with the Center for the Political Future — were a testament to the widespread political efficacy the midterms wrought. 
A mere day later, however, we were hit with the news of Wednesday night’s shooting. 
At Thousand Oaks’ Borderline Bar & Grill, a popular establishment packed with young people on its college night, 13 lives were taken, including that of the shooter and a sheriff. The venue was not so different from our own 901 Bar & Grill, and USC’s proximity to the attack has greatly impacted many students. Those present largely hailed from Pepperdine University, Cal Lutheran University, Moorpark College, CSU Channel Islands and other schools. 
There’s no doubt our domestic efforts partly advanced the youth voter phenomenon that gripped the nation at large, but the USC community must not grow complacent in the off-election years to come. 
Students must support not just each another but our neighboring communities and young people across the nation. In a memo to the USC community Thursday, Provost Michael Quick put it best: “In each instance [of disaster], we have banded together, supported each other, worked through our grief as a community, and rededicated ourselves to the creation of a better world where this no longer happens.” Now, more than ever, we cannot stop. 
As young people, we have grown up tragically accustomed to gun violence, and prepared for the possibility that a shooting could occur at any given time. We, and future generations of Americans, should not have to live with that pervasive fear in our lives. We must continue to push for change in a world that has become riddled with violence — a world where schools, movie theaters, concerts, bars and places of worship are no longer safe — and the best way to achieve that change is through advocacy, organizing and voting. 
The only way to enact positive legislative change is by voting and if this election cycle has taught us anything, it’s that our vote and our voice matter. Our campus had made considerable strides in political participation over the past few months, but we can’t afford to slow down when our peers and colleagues are being senselessly killed. 
We can’t forget that we have the potential to alter the nation’s political future for the better. Between now and next Election Day, let’s keep doing what we’re doing: making calls, knocking on doors, mobilizing our peers on-campus and engaging online. 
With older generations’ turnout remaining stagnant at 68.9 percent and Baby Boomers having surpassed their peak voting power in 2004 according to a Pew Research Center report, it’s well within the power of young voters to radically improve the state of American politics. We all have a responsibility to show up on the streets and at the polls, and we must take that responsibility seriously.

Anita Hill speaks to a crowd of USC students and faculty in Bovard Auditorium. (Photo courtesy of Michael Glier)
In 1991, Anita Hill became the first woman to publicly testify against the nomination of a Supreme Court justice on the basis of sexual misconduct. Almost 30 years later, after the rise of the #MeToo movement, Hill’s story is more relevant than ever. 
Hill, who was greeted with a standing ovation in Bovard Auditorium, spoke to hundreds of USC students and faculty members Thursday afternoon about the systemic causes and effects of sexual harassment. Political science professor Ange-Marie Hancock moderated the conversation. 
“We’ve got to think of sexual harassment as a safety issue, as a civil rights issue, as a health issue, as a business issue,” Hill said. 
Hill, now a professor at Brandeis University, is best known for her 1991 testimony against Clarence Thomas, then-nominee to the Supreme Court. Hill worked as Thomas’ assistant in the early 1980s, when she said Thomas sexually harassed her. She testified about her experiences before the all-white male Senate Judiciary Committee. Thomas was eventually confirmed to the Supreme Court. 
Following the hearings, 1992 saw an increase in the number of women elected nationwide. The year was coined the “Year of the Woman,” and Hill became a national symbol for survivors of sexual assault. 
The Bovard event was originally scheduled for a smaller venue, but high reservation numbers moved the discussion to a more spacious location. 
Hill spoke about the importance of collecting long-term data to understand the scope of systemic sexual harassment’s negative effects on victims and the institutions in which they occur. 
“What impact does the prevalence of harassment have on the people who weren’t harassed, but who are witnessing it?” Hill said. “Because living, [working or training in an environment] will have an impact on your trust in the institution and on your own behavior.”
The issue of sexual harassment covers many areas of public concern, and Hill said she was confused why it hasn’t been treated as a business crisis.  “We know that it can impact people’s economic well-being, we know it can impact institutions’ economic well-being,” Hill said. 
Hill was referencing mishandling of sexual misconduct allegations against executives from Uber and Google have recently resurfaced, drawing negative public attention to the companies.
Hill also spoke at length about the intersections of race, gender and other societal factors that affect victims of sexual harassment. To illustrate her point, she cited a New York Times article that said the recent Brett Kavanaugh hearings had nothing to do with race in comparison with the Hill-Thomas hearings of 1991. 
“There is a neutrality of whiteness that is still in operation,” Hill said. “Any time you’re talking about  elitism and privilege in the same conversation as whiteness, then race is a factor. When you’re talking about the privileged life that Brett Kavanaugh lived … race is a factor. Race is always a factor.” 
When an audience member asked Hill what she would have asked Kavanaugh during the hearings, Hill responded that she would ask him how he views his own power, and whether he considers his power to be a weapon.  
Hancock Alfaro asked Hill for her thoughts on an incident that occurred on campus last month, when Young Americans for Freedom, a conservative student organization on campus, displayed a sign that read: “It’s a Dangerous Time for Men — Change My Mind.” 
Relating the display to her own experience in 1991, she said her job is not to change the mind of someone whose mind is already made up. 
“My job was to say what happened, and it was their job to come in with an open mind and to understand … why what I was saying was important,” Hill said. “When people say, ‘change my mind,’ it tells you … their mind is already made up.” 
Hill said the power and wealth that white men preferentially experience have not changed during the course of history. She added that while she didn’t know who wrote the sign, she “would imagine it was a young white man.” 
Hill said that when she felt demonized by those who did not believe her testimony, she found comfort in those she was closest to. Looking back almost three decades, Hill had some advice for the audience. 
“[Survivors] want to see reflected back, in the people they confide in, the good in them,” Hill said. “Embrace yourself, embrace the people who care and love you, [and] get rid of the people who don’t.”

The Department of Public Safety advised students to be aware of their surroundings in light of a mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, which killed 13 people — including the shooter and a sheriff — late Wednesday evening. 
“The first thing students should do, and admittedly most of us don’t, is to consider [their] options before something happens,” DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said. “If you’re at a club, then think ahead of time… ‘What would I do should something occur … Do I know where the exits are? Do I know how to get in touch with the friends?’”
Student organizations at USC, such as the Chinese American Student Association, host events at venues similar to the Borderline, which was holding line-dancing lessons for college students at the time of the shooting. 
CASA co-President Andrew Chow said the event hit close to home.
“It’s very sad to see [the shooting] but it’s a good time to reflect how we can run our events and how we should in the future be very cautious,” Chow said. 
According to Chow, CASA’s officers will advise members to be aware of their surroundings, stick together and be conscious of their decisions for future clubbing events.
Carlisle also said students should be prepared in case a similar situation occurs on campus or nearby. 
He noted that DPS provides training, which follows the active shooter “run, hide, fight” protocol and offers advice to the USC community about how to act in similar emergency situations. 
The 901 Bar & Grill, a popular venue for USC students, said that security procedures are crucial to its business operations. Each night, the bar has six security officers on duty.
“We are saddened by the events of [Wednesday],” owner Alex Manos said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Our prayers are with all those involved …. We also hold close relationships with LAPD and DPS. The safety of all of our customers including the student body of USC is always our first priority.” 
Students who attended the Borderline’s college night hailed from Pepperdine University, Cal Lutheran University, Moorpark College, CSU Channel Islands and other schools in the greater Los Angeles area. The University sent out a memorandum on Thursday, expressing support to the USC community. 
“On behalf of our entire university, I offer my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims of the shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill,” Provost Michael Quick wrote. “Reports suggest many of the victims are college-age, which makes this latest shooting hit even closer to home. I know many of you are tired and angry, and I share those feelings.”

  The Presidential Search Advisory Committee will begin interviews for USC’s next president in early 2019, according to a memo to the USC community issued by Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso. 
“Over 2,000 students, faculty, staff, alumni, and local community leaders shared their perspectives at 11 in-person forums, via the presidential search website and through emails and phone calls,” Caruso wrote in the memo. “What the committee heard and learned was informative, enlightening and also deeply moving.”
Based on community feedback, the committee created a candidate profile that outlines opportunities and challenges it expects the next University president to address, along with some expected qualifications the person should possess.  
The committee also invited those interested in become the University’s next leader to submit an application by Nov. 30.
Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso spoke at the third listening session hosted by the Presidential Search Advisory Committee. He said he is there to listen to the voice of the USC community. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The candidate profile lists primary challenges the president should address, alongside 17 professional and personal qualifications that the Presidential Search Committee is searching for. 
 “USC requires a President with vision, breadth and drive,” the profile read. “The President should be a visible, accessible and transparent leader.”
Law professor Ariela Gross, who helped draft the faculty’s letter calling for former president C. L. Max Nikias’ resignation in May, said she was pleased with the candidate profile and its desired qualifications. 
 “If we are to avoid the failures of moral leadership of the past, these things are crucial,” Gross wrote.
 Professor William Tierney, co-director of the USC Pullias Center for Higher Education, wrote an op-ed in the Times regarding Nikias’ resignation and the problems within the administration in May 2018. 
Lillian Zeng | Daily Trojan
 “I think [the profile] is well-written [and] nicely summarizes the strengths of the University and many issues confronting us,” Tierney wrote. “Any such ad needs to be optimistic, but also clear, and the advertisement does that very well.”
Graduate Student Government President Joycelyn Yip said the GSG Board and Senate will review the profile in-depth and continue to collaborate with the committee to include graduate students’ voices. 
“Because graduate and professional students were not highlighted in the ‘Students and Student Life’ portion of the document, we will remind the Committee members and the Board of Trustees of the thousands of graduate students located on other campuses and online who have their own unique accomplishments and needs,” Kip wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
GSG Vice President Kristopher Coombs said he hopes the administration will prioritize the USC community and its students in upcoming decisions regarding the presidential search. 
Lillian Zeng | Daily Trojan
“The profile reads more as a seven pages of throat-clearing to demonstrate how awesome we are, less than a page of specific qualifications and 14 pages of appendices,” Coombs wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We hope to see a stronger reflection of student interests and values in future, and once again call upon the Presidential Search Advisory Committee, other trustees and administrators to ensure that student voices are treated at an equal level as everyone else.”
Undergraduate Student Government did not comment in time for publication.
