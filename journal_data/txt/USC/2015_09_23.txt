Panelists discussed the recent Republican debate on CNN and the upcoming Republican national primary at the first California Politics Roundtable discussion of the year hosted by the Political Student Assembly and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Wednesday at noon in the Rosen Room of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The panel featured Republican political consultant Matthew Klink and Los Angeles Times political reporter Seema Mehta. Mehta has closely followed the 2016 presidential campaign as well as the 2012 and 2008 campaigns.
The conversation was moderated by Dan Schnur,  director of the Unruh Institute of Politics, as well as by the Political Student Assembly director Jenny Di and assistant director Shawn Ren.
Di opened the discussion by asking the panelists how the 2016 presidential campaign is unique compared to other campaigns.
“This campaign has upended conventional political wisdom,” Mehta said, explaining that the rise of outsiders, notably Donald Trump, has created an atypical political field.
Klink  noted that Trump’s outsider status gave him a different goal than other candidates.
“Under normal circumstances, in a multi-candidate primary, the goal would be for a candidate to solidify the base, build name identification and raise money,” Klink said. “Donald Trump’s goal is all about keeping name identification high.”
The panel also discussed the historic number of candidates in this year’s primary.
“It really is so early. I think we’re going to see a number of frontrunners between now and February,” Mehta said.
She explained that many had doubted former presidential candidate Rick Santorum, but he eventually won the Iowa caucuses in January 2012. Additionally, presidential candidates can benefit from a campaign even if they lose the nomination.
“Having attention of being a presidential candidate can translate into a television show on Fox News,” Mehta said. “There are other benefits even if you, perhaps, know that you won’t win the nomination.”
The moderators turned questioning over to students. Logan Dallas, a sophomore majoring in international relations, asked the panelists what a potential downfall of Trump’s campaign would look like.
“We’ve already seen an erosion of support,” Klink said.
He explained that the interaction between Carly Fiorina and Trump in the second Republican debate hurt Trump’s campaign.
“You saw the first chink in his armor inflicted by another candidate,” he said. “That opened up the floodgates … Donald Trump is one or two poorly worded statements from torpedoing his own campaign.”
Mehta noted that Trump has a celebrity appeal. She recounted a time when she attended the state fair with Trump and was surrounded by fans clamoring for his autograph and picture.
“It was like a movie premiere,” Mehta said.
The panel discussed the image of government in the media. Katrina Shebanow, a junior studying international relations, asked the panel how Hollywood influenced the image of corruption in Washington, D.C.
Klink believes that television shows like House of Cards hold some truth.
“Are those shows portraying something that’s already there and making it a little more extreme, or are they making it up because that’s what the public already believes?” Klink said. “I have to believe it’s probably more of the former.”
Ida Abhari, a junior studying philosophy and international relations and a writer for the Daily Trojan, asked the panelists how the systemic issue of anti-Washington sentiment could be resolved.
“I think right now it’s very easy to rail against the machine because it doesn’t really matter,” Klink said. “It’s kind of like your summer vacation, what you do for fun.”
Greyson Peltier, a junior studying business administration, asked the panelists how a legitimate presidential candidate could garner support in the Republican party.
“Trump’s advantage is that he’s been on TV for 15 years. Obama’s is that he was incredibly charismatic. You’ve got some really strong candidates that you would never know about,” Klink said. “We spend all this time saying: What do you think Trump said? If we force Trump to be more specific, he’s going to shrink like he did last week. That will allow other candidates to rise.”
Amira Perryman, a senior studying international relations, wanted to know who could get votes from the party base as well as  independent votes looking forward.
Klink noted that Carly Fiorina, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio showed promise.
“If you take hard right social conservatives, most of the rest of them, depending on how they talk about certain issues, could appeal to independents,” Mehta said.

Amid concern over rising tuition, USC has seen a 305.8 percent increase in hired administrative employees over a 25 year period, while the number of enrolled students has only increased by 66.3 percent, according to a study by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting and the American Institutes for Research which looked at data from 1987 until the 2011-12 academic year.
The New England Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit investigative newsroom based out of Boston University, conducted a 2014 investigation regarding the administrative boom that has occurred at institutions of higher education throughout the U.S. The data shows that administrative increases has substantially outpaced increases in faculty hiring and enrollment.
Luis Vidalon-Suzuki, assistant director of the Academic Cultural Assembly, said some staff increases are necessary.
“Not only has tuition increased dramatically for years, but USC has also initiated a $6 billion fundraising campaign,” Vidalon-Suzuki said. “With all this money that administration is collecting, some of it should go toward hiring necessary workers that directly affect students.”
According to an analysis performed by the New England Center and the American Institutes for Research, a social science research group, U.S. colleges have added about 517,636 administrators from 1987 to 2011, an average of 87 non-faculty employees hired every working day. At USC, the number of administrative employees has increased from 155 to 629 from 1987 to 2011.
The administrative increase comes during a time when colleges have claimed it necessary to both cut costs and raise tuition. The increase in university staffers who neither conduct research nor teach has continued, slowing only slightly during the economic downturn.
“[Colleges] have increased their hiring of part-time faculty to try and cut costs … but hiring of these other types of non-academic employees have undercut those savings,” Donna Descrochers, a principal researcher at the Delta Cost Project, an organization that studies higher-education spending, told the New England Center.
The College Board said that it is impossible to tell exactly how much the administrative boom has contributed to the increase in tuition fees and other student costs, which have doubled in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1987 at four-year, private, nonprofit universities.
If USC were to have increased tuition solely to adjust for inflation, tuition per semester should have increased from $9,123 in 1995 to $14,285 in 2015. However, USC tuition for the 2015 fall semester was set at $24,732, a $951 increase per semester since the 2014 school year.
Vidalon-Suzuki commented on the Undergraduate Student Government’s efforts to have a conversation with the administration about this issue.
“Unfortunately, it has been hard for members in USG to successfully contact administration regarding these issues,” Vidalon-Suzuki said. “USG strongly advocates for  [change], and we have repeatedly voiced our support for adding resources that go directly back to the students. More transparency from administration regarding these changes could possibly help bring these necessary additions to counseling, environmental health and disability.”
Dan King, president of the American Association of University Administrators, told the New England Center that the criticism directed toward universities for the administrative boom is legitimate.
“None of them have reduced campus administrative burdens at all,” King said. “They’ve added a layer of bureaucracy, and in 95 percent of the cases it’s an unnecessary bureaucracy and a counterproductive one.”
The Office of University Advancement did not respond to request for comment.

Sophomore Kyle Pham made his idea of a subscription-based service that allows people to enjoy 3D printing through a monthly delivery a reality. The only catch — the contents of the shipments are a mystery.
On Sept. 15th, Pham officially launched a Kickstarter campaign for his start-up, CubeForme. Each month, subscribers of CubeForme receive a delivery of featured designers’ 3D printed work.
Pham, who is majoring in cognitive science and philosophy, politics and law, thought of the idea with high school classmate Nick Nguyen when they were brainstorming ideas for creating their own business.
“At first, Nick and I considered using graphic design to make t-shirts, but we soon realized that market was too saturated,” Pham said. “We ended up choosing 3D printing because we were intrigued by the process and figured the average consumer probably was, too.”
According to Pham, 3D printing is an entirely different application because it has a steep learning curve. Most people are not familiar with 3D printing, so he and Nguyen wanted to present it in an easier format that anyone could access and understand.
The duo reached out to a handful of 3D designers to include in the startup. Their vision was to create a platform that could support these designers while giving consumers the opportunity to physically interact with their products.
“I thought a subscription box would be a great way to enter the business field, and Kyle had his heart set on helping artists by featuring them in one way or another,” Nguyen said.
According to CubeForme’s website, every month subscribers receive a box that showcases the innovative work of a featured designer. The contents of the box are always a surprise and anything can be inside them, from aesthetic models of figurines to functional objects such as 3D printable clocks.
Though subscribers won’t know exactly what they will get, they always have the caveat of knowing the designer beforehand.
Luis Picarzo, a mechanical engineer from Spain, is one of CubeForme’s prolific 3D designers.
Picarzo found out about the startup when he stumbled upon an invitation in his email.
“A CubeForme message appeared one day in my inbox in Thingiverse [a design community],” Picarzo said. “Kyle, the cofounder, explained his new platform with a contagious enthusiasm I couldn’t ignore.”
Intrigued by the idea and impressed with the team’s hard work and passion, Picarzo decided to join CubeForme’s initial campaign.
“To me, it is a good way to meet new people with similar interests and inspirations, not to mention I get to continue designing things and improving every day,” Picarzo said.
According to Picarzo, 3D printing is a form of freedom. He considers it a vehicle for constantly creating new things and hopes CubeForme will continue to help him share his passion.
Pham and Nguyen also look forward to raising more awareness about 3D printing. They have already recruited supporters, including fellow students for their team, as well as James Bottom, project director of Blackstone LaunchPad.
“I first met Kyle in my freshman startup seminar,” Bottom said. “He later joined Blackstone Launchpad to seek a more customized roadmap for CubeForme.”
Blackstone LaunchPad is the largest interdisciplinary entrepreneurial program at USC, and has already coached over 250 student ventures since its opening last spring.
“We also have the largest collection of 3D printers, so students can get trained via 3D and 4D printing and create their own prototypes,” Bottom said.
According to Bottom, the program not only helps students develop entrepreneurial skills and mindsets, but it also builds a community of creators and problem solvers.
Pham and Nguyen both agree that CubeForme’s journey has not always been easy or glamorous, but they’ve been able to learn how to juggle school and workthrough the process.
“While there are ‘big’ days like opening up our website or launching our Kickstarter campaign, a majority of the days we’re figuring out mundane tasks such as how to make shipping labels or where to buy boxes,” Nguyen said.
Nguyen said CubeForme has received compliments, but some have criticized its business model.
“Even though we’ve gotten great feedback and support, we also come across individuals who have 3D printers themselves, and they just don’t see it as something for the broad audience,” Pham said.
Nevertheless, with the help of LaunchPad and other USC programs, such as 707Development and 3D4E Club, CubeForme is already on its way to going live.
Currently, CubeForme has 47 backers on its Kickstarter campaign and has already reached $1,564 of its $5,000 goal.
With just over a month left to go, Pham and Nguyen plan on uploading a visual chart of the backer rewards, so supporters can keep track of the startup’s progress and see an illustration of the rewards they will be receiving.
“Our ultimate vision for CubeForme is to make it more than just a subscription box. We want to be a company that connects 3D printing to the greater community,” Pham said.

Gould School of Law Dean Andrew Guzman met with Alex Hurd, president of the Student Bar Association, earlier this week to apologize for the administration’s handling of the recent decision to limit the Gould Annual Alumni Tailgate to only alumni.
“He took it on himself to remedy whatever miscommunication happened,” Colton Cray, a second-year law student, said. “They’re working with the Student Bar Association … in order to create a new replacement event … so the student body knows that the administration does feel bad about the miscommunication, and they want to fix it.”
Kyle Jones, dean of students at the Gould School, sent out an email Friday informing students that the Alumni Tailgate, which was scheduled for last Saturday and had traditionally been open to students, would only be available to alumni this year.
“It was not our intention to give such short notice, and we understand that it was both disrespectful and very inconvenient to the students,” said Scott Altman, vice dean of the Gould School.
Guzman plans to meet with the entire Gould student body next Tuesday in order to apologize for having given them late notice about the change. He has also agreed to have the law school fund the next tailgate for students.
“We had no specific desire to be excluding students. We decided to make a change to a new location because not enough alumni had been coming to the event in prior years,” Altman said. “Once we changed locations, we had a much more limited space available, and so we decided to make it alumni-only.”
The late notice was due to an administrative error, Altman said. The law school has several understaffed offices, and two offices each thought the other would be meeting with student leaders to give advance notice about the policy change. The mistake was not discovered until much later, delaying the announcement about the tailgate.
“At the time it ruffled a lot of feathers … but it made sense … Resources are limited this year,” Cray said. “At the end of the day, it was fine. Students got their own tailgate … They’ve really gone above and beyond remedying the situation.”

It was a sweet victory for the No. 3-ranked USC women’s volleyball team on Wednesday night as they opened up their Pac-12 conference schedule with a sweep on the road against crosstown rival and No. 13-ranked UCLA in straight sets (25-22, 25-12, 25-19).
The 105th all-time meeting between the two schools would prove to be one-sided as the Women of Troy drew first blood and never allowed the Bruins into the match.
With the sweep in Westwood, USC improved to 13-0 and 1-0 in conference, while UCLA’s eight-match winning streak was snapped and the Bruins fell to 9-2, 0-1 overall.
Perhaps the star of the match was freshman outside hitter Alyse Ford. While playing in her first ever rivalry match, Ford came out of the gates swinging.
“I was just looking forward to experiencing my first rivalry game,” Ford said.
In the first set, the Laguna Beach, California, native tallied five kills on a .667 hitting clip to lead USC. The Bruins could not figure out how to stop Ford, as the freshman continued to pound away in the front court to finish the night with 11 kills to lead USC.
“Personally, I’ve just been trying to be more poistive and limit my errors as much as possible,” Ford said. “Once I limit my errors, everything opens up more and I’m able to get into more of a rhythm.”
Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio had an uncharacteristically off-night, tallying just 10 kills on 33 swings. Bricio, the nation’s leader in aces per set (0.87) and points per set (6.26), did, however, record a service ace and four blocks.
Junior middle blocker Elise Ruddins had a big night for the Women of Troy as well, hitting .500 and adding eight kills and four blocks of her own.
Freshman setter Baylee Johnson, who ranks ninth in the Pac-12 with 6.84 assists per set, dished out 18  helpers and added eight digs, while junior setter Alice Pizzasegola added 16 assists of her own.
Inside a packed Pauley Pavilion, the Women of Troy took it to the Bruins from the opening whistle and never let UCLA or the Bruin faithful get going. In the first set, USC ran out to a 13-5 lead thanks to solid defense and blocking at the net.
“Playing here … it was amazing seeing all the people coming in from UCLA and giving us a hard time, but we ended up pulling through,” Ford said.
UCLA would pull within two at 21-19, but Ford’s five kills in the set would make the difference as the Women of Troy gutted out the 25-22 set victory.
The second set would be more of the same for USC, as the Women of Troy led by as many as 12 points to silence the Bruin crowd.
Timely kills by Bricio and solid setting by Johnson allowed USC to pull out the 25-12 clobbering in the second set.
It was déjà vu in the third set for USC as the Women of Troy pulled out to a 14-5 lead early. Ford and Bricio teamed up at the pins once again and an ace by freshman libero Victoria Garrick ended the third set and the match in favor of USC, 25-19.
“I just try to contribute as much as I can,” Ford said. “That was the main idea when I came in … I was like how can I save Sam [Brico’s] shoulder for her next career.”
On the defensive end, USC put up a wall with 11 blocks on the night, while forcing UCLA into a mere .056 hitting percentage. Senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms, who leads the Pac-12 with 1.71 blocks per set, added five blocks to her tally.
The Women of Troy were also able to contain UCLA’s top pin hitters, including leading scorer Jordan Anderson.
Anderson, who ranks second in the Pac-12 in kills per set behind Bricio, came in averaging 4.70 kills per set, while sophomore Reilly Buechler ranked 10th with 3.58 kills per set.
USC neutralized the two and held them to only seven and six kills, respectively. The Women of Troy also outhit UCLA as a team, .267 to .056 on the night.
With the victory, USC now leads the all-time series record against UCLA, 56-49, and have won seven of the last 10 meetings against the Bruins.
Furthermore, under head coach Mick Haley, USC is now 11-4 in conference openers.
The challenging conference slate continues into the weekend for USC as the Women of Troy head up north to face a familiar foe in No. 8-ranked Stanford in Palo Alto on Sunday at 4 p.m.  in a match that will be broadcasted on the Pac-12 Network.
USC and Stanford have both split their matches in the last two years, with the Women of Troy sweeping both matches in 2013 and the Cardinal winning each meeting in 2014.
 
An excellent win over the baby faced ‘ruins especially in their house. They haven’t even started classes until today which
gave them nothing to worry about academically. I have to admit that my initial feelings before the season was not optimistic with the seniors graduating and a few transfers leaving the program. Haley’s new system and the onus on Bricio has worked wonders so far. Keep it up. Know the team will qualify for the post season along with probably five other Pac-12 members. Getting hot and stronger at the end is what counts in a 64 team tournament.

Well that didn’t go as expected. Despite entering the weekend as double-digit favorites, the USC Trojans fell handily to the Stanford Cardinal 41-31 on Saturday night.
All preseason hype came crashing down around a faltering Trojan squad that had no response for a powerful Stanford offense.
Even though the defense is mostly to blame for allowing the Cardinal to amass 474 yards of total offense, the loss will ultimately fall on the shoulders of second-year head coach Steve Sarkisian.
For the second consecutive season, the Trojans lost their third game after looking like national champion contenders in their first two.
Last season’s loss came almost 3,000 miles away from the Coliseum at the hands of Boston College.
This year, the Stanford Cardinal marched into the Coliseum and whipped the Trojans from start to finish. Somehow a team that couldn’t manage a touchdown against its first opponent, Northwestern, exploded for five touchdowns against a Trojan defense that only allowed 15 points in its first two games.
What really decimated the Trojans’ chances of making a comeback in the fourth quarter was Stanford’s ability to convert on third down. The Cardinal went 8-12 (67 percent) on third down and dominated time of possession at almost a 2:1 minute clip.
To put it frankly, the Trojans were completely outcoached for the entire game.
Entering the season, everybody knew this Stanford game would tell us if the Trojans were contenders or pretenders.
As I sat in the press box and watched Stanford consistently line up in a power formation, I kept thinking to myself, how are we not prepared for this?
If you’ve watched Stanford over the past several years under head coach David Shaw, you know they are a run first team. Basically, if you control the line of scrimmage against Stanford you have a strong shot at beating them.
Yet time and time again, the Cardinal would line up with two tight ends and consistently rush for 3-4 yards. The defense simply had no response.
Even worse, when we did hold the Cardinal to passing situations on third and long, we made Kevin Hogan look like the second coming of Andrew Luck. Out of eight third down conversions, Hogan threw for five and ran for two others. The Cardinal ended up scoring on every drive that Hogan converted a third down.
There are numerous other instances where the Trojans were seemingly unprepared for a must-win game.
Now the Trojans will be playing for their Pac-12 lives this Saturday against Arizona State. The last time the Trojans made the trip to Tempe, their head coach was left at the airport.
So I ask the question: could Sarkisian get Kiffined (trademark pending) if the Trojans drop a second consecutive game?
Personally, I believe Sark’s job is safe for this year at least. He managed to bring in the No. 1-ranked recruiting class and is enduring his first year without scholarship reductions.
However, with each loss and public indecency incident, his seat is becoming hotter and hotter.
Sarkisian’s critics will only get louder if the Trojans continue to disappoint this season. After his drunken mishap at an alumni event earlier this year, Sark can’t afford much more to go wrong for the Trojans.
An interesting situation that could arise is if the Trojans are blown out similarly to Kiffin’s last game in charge, a 66-44 thrashing. The Trojans would sit at 2-2 (0-2) on the season and all but surely be out of the national and even Pac-12 conversation.
Sarkisian’s record as head coach would drop to 11-6 with only two of those wins coming against AP Top 25 opponents. While that record might cut it at Washington, it just won’t do in the land of Troy.
An even better question is how safe is Pat Haden’s job if the Trojans struggle this year? He is the one who hand-picked both Kiffin and Sarkisian and has given his public support for the embattled coach.
I believe Haden is undoubtedly safe for now. He helped guide the University through some of the harshest penalties ever given out by the NCAA and has seen numerous NCAA championships under his reign.
Sarkisian, on the other hand, isn’t so safe. It’s not quite a win or go home situation, but the pressure is mounting.
Winning solves everything in college football, and in a month’s time, we could all be raving about Sarkisian. That’s just the nature of sports.
For now all we can look forward to is this Saturday, when the Trojans will be playing to keep their season alive.
Sarkisian’s future could hinge upon a positive result.

Kiffin was a great recruiter…how did that work out? Recruiting is based on expectations of athlete reaching his goal through a university program. Let’s face it, USC is no longer feared as a “winning” program by their opponents. The Stanford game was a perfect example of another embarrassing chunk taken out of the tradition of the program. ASU was a blaring example last year. How long can this program hold onto its prestige as wins are slipping through their hands?

On Wednesday, defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox addressed his players’ performance after head coach Steve Sarkisian largely attributed the Trojans’ first loss to the inconsistent play of his defense on Tuesday.
“It is unacceptable how we played,” Wilcox said. “I know our guys are going to come back and fight, and we all expect to play better than that. There is no doubt, that was unacceptable.”
Stanford picked apart the USC defense for 474 yards, converting eight of 12 third downs and holding the ball for nearly 40 minutes.
Wednesday’s practice felt slower. A lot of the time, the defensive players stood in place and watched their coaches teach them different schemes and formations — something Wilcox noted his defense struggled with against Stanford.
“[Stanford gives] you a lot of different formations and personnel looks,” Wilcox said. “You can match them, and then they will break their formation. So we have to play some plays on principal, whether it is man coverage or it is zone coverage.”
When asked about the run defense that struggled all night against a hearty Stanford offensive line, Wilcox again referred to his players’ execution in those formations. Sophomore Christian McCaffrey led the Stanford rushing game with 115 yards, behind a line that pushed the Trojans to their heels all night.
“We thought we would play base against their run game to stop it early on,” Wilcox said. “So we started substituting and going with bigger people. We just felt like there were certain downs that we could probably do well against the run in base, and we didn’t. We have to finish plays when we have the chance to finish them, and we have to have the mental intensity to execute down in and down out.”
Though Sarkisian seemed pleased with his teams’ effort and spirit at practice, the Trojans will have to learn from their mistakes quickly if they want to compete at Arizona State. The Sun Devils, who some have picked to win their third Pac-12 South title in three years, haven’t quite played up to expectations this season, dropping their opener against Texas A&M, barely beating lower-division Cal Poly and stumbling in a 34-10 win over New Mexico.
“The more we continue to watch Arizona State, the more you see that they are a good football team,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “We’re going to have our work cut out for us on Saturday night.”
Sarkisian brought Wilcox with him from Washington, where the former Oregon defensive back served as the defensive coordinator for two seasons. In 2012, the Huskies were in the national top 40 in total defense.
In 2013, UW’s scoring defense improved to the national top 35 while its pass efficiency defense also rose 60 spots to 27th nationally. Its 41 pass sacks in 2013 are second most nationally, but one wouldn’t know it by watching USC’s most recent performance against Stanford.
“For us, we are trying to improve in that area,” Wilcox said when asked about his emphasis on getting to the quarterback.
The Trojans allowed quarterback Kevin Hogan to convert 18 of 23 passes for 279 yards with two touchdowns.
“You pick and choose your spots on pressuring, and sometimes you want to be able to rush with four guys and sometimes you are going to bring five or more, and we did both,” Wilcox said. We just weren’t effective enough to make them uncomfortable.”
Sarkisian repeatedly stressed the USC game plan in practice last week before the Stanford game: win on first down, pressure Kevin Hogan, keep containment and locate Christian McCaffrey. But Wilcox, coming off a season with poor defensive outings coming in losses to Boston College and Arizona State, failed to accomplish any of these.
“We all felt that in terms of X and O’s things just started to bleed a little bit.” Wilcox said. “We made some critical mistakes on key plays and on key drives, and in some of the one-on-ones, we were about a step away and that is where the reaction needs to be a step early, whether that be in the run game or in the pass game.”
The boos that rained down from the USC crowd on Saturday night might have resulted from the defense continually not being able to stop Stanford on third down, which kept the USC offense off the field.
“I don’t think that there is any problem with the schemes,” redshirt senior inside linebacker Anthony Sarao said. “I think it is on the players to make those plays and tackle and get off the blocks and getting to the balls.
When asked after practice if he felt the heat or criticism from the fans, Wilcox appeared calm.
“Every day I’ve ever coached college football there’s that,” Wilcox said. “For us, it is all we work on. It is everything you do, 365 days a year. So it is disappointing when you don’t go and play as well as you think you can play so we need to take corrections.”
Sarkisian reiterated his belief in his second-year defensive coordinator. Last year’s USC defense was in the nation’s Top 20 in turnover margin, red zone defense and third down conversion defense. But, USC has struggled to replace production from Leonard Williams and Hayes Pullard.
“I continue to support him the way I had been supported when I was a coordinator, and I didn’t do my best,” Sarkisian said. “We have people on our staff working extremely hard that are very bright, great coaches. They wouldn’t be here if they weren’t and I just want to make sure that they go out and continue to operate to the best of their ability.”
Wilcox, who brings a strong football background to the table, has built quality defenses at Boise State, Tennessee and Washington before USC and is widely considered to potentially become a head coach one day at the collegiate level.
His Trojan defense that returns eight starters will have to improve if Wilcox is to follow Sarkisian’s game plan for the defense this year.
“I want our defense to be aggressive, fast, opportunistic, creating turnovers and getting our hands on the ball,” Sarkisian said. “Now we have gone eight straight quarters without creating a turnover. For us to be the team we want to become, turnovers have to be a piece of that puzzle.”

On campus, students can be seen using their cell phones, laptops, iPads and other modern devices not only to Snapchat and text friends, but also for academic purposes. Assignments, syllabi, PDFs and even entire textbooks can be reached at our fingertips anywhere at any time of the day — as long as USC’s WiFi is not crashing.
But walking into classrooms and lecture halls the first week of school, some professors asked students to close their laptops and put their cellular devices away. Due to research studies and/or personal beliefs, a handful of professors on campus have decided to ban laptop and handheld technology usage during class time, fearing such use may be distracting and hinder students’ learning abilities. Though it may be unfair to ban devices that certain students have become reliant on and have found to be their most successful tools in learning, the University should consider reducing the presence of laptops in classrooms to ensure higher success rates of students who are in fact paying a very high price tag for their education.
Professors often admit to fearing losing students’ focus during class time when they are faced with only screens instead of eyes during lecture.
“I know that I have a hard time staying on task when the option to check out at any momentary lull is available; I assumed that this must be true for my students, as well,” Dartmouth professor Dan Rockmore told The New Yorker.
When classroom learning entails laptops, it’s hard not responding to friends having crises on iMessage, reaching that next level on a game or opening the ad that says PINK is having a sale on yoga pants which you need to buy right away. None of these distractions are present when laptops are shut and technology is removed from the line of focus.
For a long time, we believed technology was the future, especially in education, but studies have shown otherwise. In 2003, a study at Cornell University showed that the half of the class which was asked to not use their laptops in class performed better on a post-class quiz than those who continued regular laptop usage throughout the class.
“The experiment showed that, regardless of the kind or duration of the computer use, the disconnected students performed better on a post-lecture quiz. The message of the study aligns pretty well with the evidence that multitasking degrades task performance across the board,” Rockmore said about the study.
When professors ask students to put away their laptops and other devices, they do so for the benefit of the student. Not only are laptops a major distraction to students and at times professors, they can also hinder recall practices.
Moreover, laptop notetaking can easily turn into transcription verbatim from one screen to another.
“The act of typing effectively turns the note-taker into a transcription zombie, while the imperfect recordings of the pencil-pusher reflect and excite a process of integration, creating more textured and effective modes of recall,” Rockmore said.
But though some college professors have increasingly discouraged the use of laptops in lecture halls, many colleges and even K-12 schools are pushing for an increased presence of technology in classrooms. Many schools now provide students with laptops or iPads for the purpose of educational learning.
Technology in the classroom is great in many aspects — it can reduce the use of textbooks and print-out worksheets and documents, which eliminates paper waste, and it is easier and more manageable than carrying around heavy, overpriced textbooks. Additionally, many assignments require internet use, and online activities can engage students with interactive math and reading questions.
But exposing kids to technology at an early age is causing health professionals to be concerned with the possible mental, physical and social health implications of technology overdose. With eyes glued to a tablet or television screen, a child is cut off from the world around them, and developmental, neurological and behavioral problems like ADHD are today speculated to be linked to technology overuse.
With professors at colleges putting the brakes on technology use in classrooms and converting back to traditional methods of notetaking, allowing technology to fill younger classrooms might not be the right move. We need to take a step back from the idea that all technology is good technology and consider the struggle a child may face if he or she becomes overly attached and reliant on a device only to have it ripped away upon entering college as a freshman.
There is no doubt that technology will continue circulating throughout the hallways of schools in the United States. Though banning technology altogether in the classroom may not be necessary, it is important that school officials encourage structured and limited use of electronics and continue traditional learning methods that have proven to be effective in learning and retaining information even in today’s college classrooms.
Bravo! When my son was a freshman at USC, I sat in on some of his classes during family weekend. In one of his computer science classes, I sat in the back of the room from where I could see the screens of the many open laptops in the room. I was appalled at the number of students on Facebook and playing games during the professor’s lecture, and thought of all the tuition dollars wasted because of electronic distraction. 
I agree with the author that more professors should require that laptops and cell phones remain off during class. As an educator myself, I know that studies confirm that writing notes by hand aids memory better than typing notes.

In response to Donald Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric, the California GOP renounced its former hard line stance on “illegal aliens,” a term it frequently used, and called for a more inclusive platform altogether. While the party fixes its tone and language on the issue, immigration reform remains a contentious issue among state agencies. Just as the Republicans work to correct systemic dysfunction, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted a four-day sweep late last month to deport undocumented immigrants with criminal records. Targeted specifically in Southern California, the operation apprehended 244 immigrants convicted of at least one felony last month. To compensate for its laissez-faire approach to enforcement prior to the sweep, the ICE detained these individuals for future deportation, whereas before undocumented immigrants could easily undermine ICE operational codes and end up back on the streets with little to no repercussions for major crimes. Though the ICE effectively promotes homeland security and accounts for public safety in this case, its newly heightened avenue for enforcement threatens innocent documented and undocumented immigrants.
As part of the agency’s National Fugitive Operations Program, the sweep is both warranted and effective. But by covering such a large quantity of people in a constrained period of time, this department inadvertently constructs all immigrants into a single narrative — that of a criminal. In turn, the public’s perception of this four-day sweep homogenizes immigrants altogether as opposed to viewing each individual on a case-by-case basis.
In the past, the ICE utilized local jails to temporarily detain undocumented immigrants. Without the need to abide by regulation, ICE officials easily found and disposed of these individuals. The illegal-but-effective plan of action, however, delegitimizes the ICE as a whole. As a result, sweeps such as this one, though costly and far more complex, are the new standard operating procedure.
According to the ICE, 56 percent of immigrants convicted had criminal records that included major felonies, such as engaging in drug trade, sexual assault of minors and unauthorized possession of weaponry. The remaining 44 percent had multiple misdemeanors. A margin of error, however narrow, includes a number of immigrants without any violent offenses. Innocent immigrants who have deportations in progress are set to be removed promptly. The larger group of violent felons, in actuality, have a chance of a fair trial.
Purposefully, the perceived efficacy of this sweep not only makes it much easier for law enforcement to criminalize and antagonize all immigrants collectively, but it also restrains the system’s need for checks and balances. A great sense of accountability within the Department of Homeland Security will be lost in the frenzy of this operation’s success. The purpose is understandable — yet the execution itself holds greater repercussions that are detrimental to the sociological well-being of immigrants. The issue lies in how the sweep was articulated to the public, and particularly in the implicit and explicit messages that followed suit.
Both the National Fugitive Operations Program and the media must take responsibility in the ways in which they crafted the public’s narrow perception of immigrants. If immigrants, documented or not, are conditioned to be criminalized, the path toward social justice lies in dismantling that systemic complex. In understanding the sociological consequences of branding an entire group as criminals, it is clear that the ICE plays an important role in the public’s idea of immigration. Evidently, this potentially determines the future of policy reform.
With the 2016 election on the horizon, a narrative of this gravity can legitimize either side of the political spectrum. Opponents to inclusive citizenship can easily monopolize the four-day sweep to enforce a stigma that will bolster their own political interests and keep the disenfranchised socially immobile. The criminalization of immigrants altogether sets social stratification in place, relegating them to second-rate citizenry. Again, this characterization does not apply to the actual criminals with major offenses; it does, however, apply to those who are umbrella-led into the criminal label by way of association.
In the same way the ICE prioritizes homeland security, it should also take accountability for a more inclusive sense of public safety. Dialing back the rhetoric in the media and dismantling the black-and-white manhunt aspect of sweeps will do more than enough to ensure public safety. The ICE should not engage in large-scale sweeps in short time lapses, as it works to tarnish the public image of the immigrant and the future of political reform.

When people ask how environmentally conscious Austrailia is, the first thing I mention is the water bottle filling stations in the streets. But, there are other measures people use here in Melbourne to protect the environment. From flipping a switch in order to use an outlet to being inundated with public service posters about recycling, I have become conscious of ways to limit my waste and emissions. It all starts with Australia’s large focus on the environment in the political sphere.
What’s different about Australia is that environmental policy is a huge determinant in election cycles and in leadership within parties in Parliament. This is especially obvious in the recent change of Prime Minister, with Malcolm Turnbull replacing Tony Abbott. The shift comes at a pivotal moment in determining the trajectory of COP21, the Climate Summit, in Paris.
Critics question Turnbull’s approach as his previous statements of increasing policy to stop the effects of the global warming, including the reintroduction of the unpopular carbon tax, do not necessarily align with his party’s policies. The shift from Abbott, a strong supporter of the Australian coal industry, which accounts for a large portion of the world’s coal, to Turnbull reflects the continually evolving platform of Australian environmental policy.
Along with policy at the international level, measures meant to mitigate the effects of climate change show up in daily life. For over a century, Melbourne has used electric trams for mobility. The trams are an indisputable symbol of the city and an emblem of environmental awareness. Reliance on public transportation alleviates a good amount of the traffic problems in the streets. Electric trams line the city, forming a grid in the center and span out to the several districts.
The trams are even free to ride throughout the Central Business District. In Sydney, ferries account for a huge source of transportation, providing a seamless way to get from one side of the world’s largest natural harbor to the other.  Relative to Los Angeles, provision of public transportation is a struggling area in a city highly dependent on motor vehicles.
With several hundred kilometers of biking lanes, Melbourne highly encourages the use of bicycles. Bike sharing booths line several street corners and helmets even come attached to bikes as it’s enforced by law to wear a helmet at all times. The law is definitely an acceptable measure as approaching the intersections of trams, pedestrian crossings and car lanes make cycling a daunting task. Frankly, my desire to cycle vanished after seeing a biker hit by a car my first week here.
Biking has slowly begun its transition into Los Angeles lifestyle, especially through Los Angeles Metro’s planned implementation of bike sharing systems throughout downtown L.A. Concerns arise in the safety of bikers, pedestrians and motorists alike as suddenly a new operator enters the domain. If it was not difficult enough to cross through the Hoover intersection on a bike, imagine the terror that would arise if cars were suddenly added to the picture in a larger crossing. Bikes are a gradual system to be cycled in.
The prices of plastic water bottles, generally ranging between $2 to 5 in Australian Dollars, about $1.50 to $3 in U.S. dollars, are similar to prices of bottles in Los Angeles, but people are seldom seen buying bottles from convenience stores and restaurants due to the quality of tap water and abundance of water fountain and bottle-filling stations in the streets.
All street bins have sections divided for recycling and general waste, as well as for cigarette disposal. Cigarette sales also provide a huge revenue source as taxes amount to more than 60 percent of the price paid. Australian Parliament sees gradual increases in this tax as a largely undisputed means of limiting the use of cigarettes because it contributes highly to air pollution. In comparison, taxes make up a mere 43 percent of the price paid on cigarettes bought in America.
In Australia, boxes of cigarettes do not bear the traditional design created by its distributing entity, rather, all tobacco products have a standard black exterior and bear images of the harmful effects associated with smoking along with descriptions. The regulatory nature of even the outside of cigarette cartons demonstrates the socially liberal mindset in Australia that extends even past environmentally conscious measures. Moreover, though cigarette smoking is largely acceptable in public areas, the University of Melbourne recently became a smoke-free campus, a model reflective of similar intolerance measures used throughout Los Angeles. In regard to regulating second-hand smoke in the public domain, USC still puts non-smokers at risk.
Additionally, animal conservation is a big effort in Australia. Australia’s distinct wildlife is a core representative of its culture. The iconic koala has been at risk after being hunted to near extinction in the 1990s. The conservation movement was what effectively stopped their obliteration. Animal sanctuaries, wildlife parks and conservation foundations play a large role in protecting Australia’s biodiversity, along with governmental regulation within the different states.
As kangaroos roam the suburbs in Canberra and wombats willingly engage with campers in Tasmania, nature is emblematic of Australian culture. Thus, the importance of environmental protection remains at the forefront of governmental policy and Melbourne living.

In the most relatable terms, Mindy Kaling, from her first book, Is Everyone Hanging out Without Me? (And Other Concerns),  is like a meeting with an old friend over coffee, sharing stories, laughing together and assuring that the friendship will always stay the same. Kaling, in her newest book, Why Not Me? represents the same old friend, but one who has changed. Everything is familiar, but meeting up also feels forced at the same time. Though there’s no doubt that Kaling is a comedic genius, her new book is disappointing to fans who have been following her for a long time. She aims to be compelling, thoughtful and funny but does not achieve it to the same degree that she did in previous works.
Kaling starts off her new book in the same way she did the first one. She begins with her comical, yet relatable, grade school experiences, which include the time when she didn’t have any friends and was a lonely girl who struggled with acceptance. Then, she talks about the era of when she worked on The Office, but talks less about her experiences at the show and focuses more on the bizarre and glamorous life of becoming an actress in Hollywood. Her tone is a contradictory combination of self-deprecation and self-aggrandizement. She spends an unnecessary amount of time recalling the intimate details of her Hollywood friendships, the spectacular parties she’s been invited to and the ridiculous drama that’s come out of it, wrapping it up with a few sentences of the “but I’m not one of them” style of humility.
Kaling recollects struggles she’s gone through, most of which she admits are first-world problems, without much appreciation for what she has. Though she usually ends her long complaints with a few sentences of gratitude, the reader can’t help but feel that it is no longer genuine. There are the occasional jokes and insightful observations, like when she imagines what her life would have been if she didn’t become a comedy writer and instead became a high school history teacher. Kaling clearly has a talent for writing but somehow ends up writing about things that make her appear to lack depth, a depth that was clear in her first book. She is casual and fun, but in a way that feels like reading your 13-year-old little sister’s unfiltered diary and not the cool and inspiring actress you always wanted to be friends with.
The more redeeming and sincere parts of the biography are when Kaling talks about her trials in finding love and her journey to self-confidence. She speaks fondly of her best friend, ex-boyfriend and The Office co-star, B.J. Novak.  Though she describes their relationship as “complicated,” the way she writes about him is endearing.  They are “soup snakes,” a reference from the seventh season of The Office, where Michael Scott mistakenly reads “soul mates” as “soup snakes” when describing his relationship with Holly Flax. When writing, she lets B.J. read everything she writes. ”I just want to impress him. He is very difficult to impress. You can never predict what he’ll like,” she says. She values his opinion and appreciates his input, even when it might not always be what she wants to hear (and sometimes causes her to angrily storm out of the room or ignore him). She also divulges entertaining anecdotes about her dating experience with a man from the White House, which is mostly bragging about the impressive parties and events she got invited to.
The topic of body image is a recurring one throughout the book, sometimes as a way to poke fun at herself and other times seriously discussed. Kaling talks about how it hurts her feelings when people label her and see her only as an “overweight minority with a TV show.” She talks about how she doesn’t like herself sometimes. In the last chapter, she focuses on the topic of confidence.  “I’m a big fat fraud,” she writes. “I’m completely not at peace with the way I look. I don’t wake up in the morning, look at my naked body in the mirror and say ‘Good morning body. Once again you’ve totally nailed it. You gorgeous and perfect thing. That wobbly patch of cellulite? A miracle. Each stretch mark? A Picasso. Holy crap I look good.’” Kaling explains that confidence is a lot like respect: It needs to be earned.
So maybe the old friend from the coffee shop didn’t change. Maybe this is who Mindy always has been. Though she may come off as braggy and shallow in a way that will make you think, “Is she for real?” Mindy is honest in the way that she owns up to it and doesn’t pretend to not be. She had to fight to reach the amount of self-confidence she has today and openly admits that she still struggles to love herself despite being a body-positive role model. Though Why Not Me? was a slight disappointment, at least Mindy Kaling is brave enough to be herself in this judgmental world, and there’s so much respect in that.

Many common grammatical errors bother me. “Your” vs. “you’re,” “their,” “there” and “they’re” and flat-out incorrect words and expressions like “supposively” and “play it by year.” None of these errors, however, bother me more than the misuse and abuse of the poor dollar sign.
In English, the only accepted way to write an amount of money is with the dollar sign appearing before the value. For example, it is correct to write “$20”; it is incorrect to write “20$,” “2$0,” “$20$” or any other placement of the dollar sign.
Unfortunately, I have been invited to several Facebook events in which the host demands “20$” for entry to his or her event. This is, by far, the most atrocious mistake someone can make while writing. With “your” and “you’re,” at least both spellings of the word are common, so it makes sense for them to be confused. This also applies to “their,” “there” and “they’re.” Where have Americans seen “20$”?  Please, someone who is fond of value-then-sign, name one store or one online retailer that writes its prices like that because I have yet to see it. 
How many times do you need to see a price tag, a withdrawal, a transaction, anything involving buying and selling to know that the dollar sign appears before the value? It should always be written this way, whether the value is $1, $2, $3.42 or $1,000,000. 
Please, event hosts, get it together. You really deserve to make no money off of your event. Technically, you never asked for it, as 20$ is not even a real thing. For all I know, that could be some type of HTML code or the name of a new Ke$ha song, because it is certainly not a monetary value. 
Stop confusing the masses and place that dollar sign in front of the number you’re asking for. As Tyra Banks once yelled to an America’s Next Top Model contestant, “Learn something from this!”

It’s a sports columnist’s worst fear to be wrong. When USC lost to Stanford by double digits last Saturday at the Coliseum, I received a few texts and emails from people — the majority of whom I don’t know — calling me expletives and, most importantly, telling me that I was mistaken in projecting USC to blowout the Cardinal. 
“Your column was f*cked up dude, why are you making predictions,” one person messaged me. 
I will always remember Sept. 19, 2015, as the day that I was completely and blatantly wrong — not only about the final score, but also about the way the game would flow and how each team would play. With that, even I began to doubt my ability to be a successful and respected columnist. 
Then I realized that writing a weekly column is a lot like playing the actual game itself. You’re going to win some, you’re going to lose some, but regardless of wins and losses, I’m going to come back and be ready to play because it’s what I love to do. 
I’ve written more than 25 columns during my Daily Trojan career, and though I was more passive in my writing towards the beginning of my career, breaking down complex issues is sports which are important to address, I’ve since begun to understand what my readers enjoy most from me — my hot takes. 
More recently, when I’ve been coming to the plate and putting my head down to begin writing every week, I haven’t been trying to just get on base — I’m trying to hit home runs. 
It’s one of the most overused cliches in all of sports, but when you’re trying to swing for the fences, you’re going to strike out sometimes.
I asserted that USC would blow out Stanford. My game plan didn’t pan out, and neither did USC’s, but in the words of just about any football coach after a loss, I’m going to hold myself accountable, watch the tape [in this case my writing] to see what went wrong, move on and hopefully come out on top next week. 
A short memory is important  in sports, but as much as I want to completely forget about what transpired this past week, I’m going to use my miscalculations and blunders to make me a stronger and more accurate columnist over the course of the rest of the year. 
My latest bold prediction: The Trojans and I will bounce back and improve for the sake of all of our fans this week — I sure hope that’s the case at least. 
*If you want to go back and read over my failed prediction, check it out here: http://dailytrojan.com/2015/09/17/stanford-will-not-test-the-trojans/ 
* If you want to see how I bounce back, Persian Persuasion runs in the paper every Friday.
