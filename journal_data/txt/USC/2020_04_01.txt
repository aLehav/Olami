President Carol Folt announced in a mid-February letter that, beginning with the undergraduate Class of 2024, USC students coming from families whose annual income is under $80,000 will receive free tuition. This development is in line with Folt’s goal to increase the University’s affordability and accessibility. According to her letter, the new policy will do just that for more than 4,000 students a year going forward.
However, the rest of the undergraduate population may feel like they just missed out. Returning students who come from families with similar financial statuses became USC students a few years — or even just a year — too early to receive free tuition. Especially for underclassmen, who still have several years of their undergraduate education left to complete, this new policy could have been very valuable.
While the new policy shows that USC is moving toward accommodating financially underprivileged students, it does not demonstrate that it is willing to use all of its power and funds to achieve equity. If Folt estimates that 4,000 students each year will be eligible for free tuition, then that means there are roughly 12,000 current USC students who would have been eligible for free tuition. This demonstrates a clear need for more financial support in USC’s current student population that the University is not addressing.
Although the University cannot go back in time to eliminate tuition that was already paid, it could alleviate additional financial strain on its current students under the $80,000 margin by granting them free tuition from here on out. It would be especially valuable for current students because they — unlike incoming students — have already been paying USC’s expensive tuition. As a result, many have shouldered a tremendous financial burden and will face copious amounts of student loan debt post-graduation. 
Despite the fact that many transfer students at USC are first-time four-year university students, the new policy does not extend to them either. Unlike students who begin their undergraduate education at USC, transfer students already face disadvantages like the absence of a Freshman Forgiveness policy and guaranteed on-campus housing. 
On top of this, the University does not provide them with the same financial aid benefits as freshmen, as many scholarships are only accessible to first year students. In order to ensure all students have a smooth transition into USC, the University should consider extending the new financial aid policy to transfer students. In addition, free tuition is certainly enticing to incoming freshmen, but it would similarly encourage more transfer students to attend USC.
A substantial expansion of the new financial aid policy is especially necessary now during a time when the coronavirus pandemic has caused families to undergo additional economic hardship. Many parents may have lost jobs, which significantly decreases families’ abilities to afford the University’s staggering and ever-increasing cost of attendance. The pandemic has affected, and will continue to affect, the financial statuses of not only USC’s incoming class of freshmen but its current students as well, and the University should work to meet the continued financial needs of its students.
If the University truly wants to “educate students, independent of their background or ability to pay,” it is falling short of this goal by not including all students in its new financial aid plan. It seems unfair that two students in the same financial situation may have completely different aid offers; one may be given free tuition, and the other may pay thousands of dollars simply because they entered USC a year earlier.

As another uncomfortable week of quarantine slithers past, millions of Americans remain anxious about the toll that the coronavirus pandemic will take on the country. Before long, many will be diagnosed with the virus and be forced to seek treatment from health care facilities that are already beginning to collapse under such unimaginable burdens. As pulmonary and critical-care physician Dr. Daniela Lamas grimly noted in The New York Times, many will draw their last, labored breaths in relative obscurity, denied the chance to say their final goodbyes to loved ones.
It does not have to be this way.
While the arrival and subsequent spread of the coronavirus were all but inevitable, the country’s systemic refusal to prepare for this crisis has profoundly exacerbated the damage it caused. Inadequate funding for health care infrastructure, disincentives for medical training and scattershot means of providing coverage have rendered the United States exceptionally vulnerable to this pandemic. 
The devastating ineptitude of the U.S. health care system was a widely covered topic well before the coronavirus arrived. In tragic irony, the waning months of the 2010s were especially dominated by grandiose promises to finally fix the system. The rhetoric of optimizing treatment and guaranteeing coverage was an inescapable motif throughout the duration of the recent Democratic primaries — just as it has been in nearly every single election cycle since the start of the century. 
And yet, in spite of such overwhelming discourse, the federal government has invariably failed to make any tangible progress in this regard. Rather, tedious debates, partisan gridlock and empty policies delay pressure for critical reform and therefore maintain complicity. Now, the consequences wrought by decades of Congress’ unwillingness to take necessary action are erupting in an unprecedented catastrophe.
In marked contrast to most of the modern world, the United States has been historically reluctant to allocate federal funding for health care. Instead, the country has opted for a system primarily funded through private insurance, wherein steady employment is often a prerequisite to treatment, according to data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau. In doing this, the United States has established a system that forces providers to consider treatment within the contexts of the bottom line, rather than prioritizing an assurance of quality care for all.
Therefore, most health care facilities are operating under extremely narrow margins and are seeking to do as much as they can with as little as possible, inherently constraining the resources made available to each individual patient. Necessities such as masks, ventilators and beds are allocated with intense frugality, just barely stocking as much as needed under typical circumstances, according to data collected by the Health Policy Center at the D.C.-based Urban Institute. 
Except these times are anything but typical. Government officials throughout the country spent months refusing to spend public money in preparation for the impending crisis. In keeping with its own status quo, the government absolved itself of responsibility for the nation’s health care system, deferring that duty to the underfunded disarray of the country’s private sector. 
As cases of the coronavirus began to trickle out of China, Italy and other high-risk countries, the American health care apparatus was little more than a ship on a fixed course toward an iceberg. Without pre-existing, sufficient access to public funding, the proverbial ship was equipped with nothing other than a faint hope that the government would distribute life preservers only after the sinking had already begun.
As the pandemic disrupts all aspects of society, a health care system that is largely contingent on the prosperity of the private marketplace is nothing short of doomed without government intervention. The inevitable surge in unemployment will inherently yield an abundance of uninsured patients who will face dizzying out-of-pocket expenses for treatment. For many Americans, the total cost of recovering from the coronavirus will surpass their annual income.
In principle, the virus has not introduced these issues to American society. Rather, the disease has exploited the countless systemic inadequacies that have long defined the existing state of our health care. According to experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, thousands — if not millions — of people will die directly as a result of this disease. Moreover, a recent edition of the New England Journal of Medicine asserts that many others will be auxiliary casualties of the pandemic, succumbing to ailments that are entirely unrelated to the coronavirus simply because the existing apparatus is unable to treat them.
As a result of these desperate circumstances, the country has resorted to draconian measures hitherto unthinkable in modern life. In a rather futile attempt to stymy the spread of the disease, the government has hastily sought to perform its duties retroactively. After years of denial, the threat of millions of casualties has compelled our leaders to treat health care as a universal, public right. 
While these efforts may ultimately prove to be too little, too late, they may prove to be a silver lining as this crisis continues to cast its ominous shadow on the country. The coronavirus may soon serve as a catalyst for enlightenment, engendering a new era in which the United States finally recognizes its standing obligation to ensure adequate health care of its people. Although this does not atone for its past failings, it is a hope that must be maintained during these trying times.

Former assistant director of the Office of Graduate Admission Hiu Kit David Chong has agreed to plead guilty for accepting money in exchange for submitting fraudulent documents on the part of Chinese graduate students to help them gain admission to the University, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday. 
Chong worked in the Office of Graduate Admissions from 2008 to 2016. 
In addition to procuring falsified personal statements and letters of recommendation, Chong purchased college transcripts from a Chinese supplier from as early as February 2015 to around December 2018 and offered to research how students could enlist surrogate test-takers for the TOEFL, according to the documents. 
“Defendant Chong, together with others known and unknown to the United States Attorney’s Office, knowingly and with the intent to defraud, devised and participated in, and executed a scheme to defraud USC as to material matters and to obtain property from USC, namely, admission to USC, by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises and the concealment of material facts,” the documents read.
Three students from China paid Chong between $8,000 and $12,000 for admission into USC graduate programs, according to the documents. In total, Chong revealed to the FBI that he had received nearly $40,000 from different international and other undisclosed students for completing these scams. The payments were made after the students had signed a contract through Chong’s now inactive company So Cal International Group, which was purported to specialize in academic consulting.
The FBI started an undercover operation in July 2017 in which an agent, posing as a friend of fabricated international student Lin Guoqiang, asked Chong to help him gain admission into USC, according to court documents. Chong acquired a fake transcript showing the student’s GPA at 3.47 and met the agent in December 2018 to collect $8,500 after securing Guoqiang’s admission. 
“Please DO NOT mail the transcript directly to USC or anyone else,” Chong wrote in an email to the supposed friend in April 2018, according to court documents.
USC believes Chong’s case to be an isolated incident that did not involve other employees, the University said in a statement. 
“The university has cooperated with the government’s investigation,” the statement read. “Chong concealed these actions from the university and continued engaging in them for two-and-a-half years after he left USC.”
According to the terms of the deal, Chong will plead guilty to one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.

Undergraduate Student Government President Trenton Stone delivered his State of USG address Tuesday, highlighting the student government’s achievements including the creation of a bylaw to increase student body representation in the organization, strengthened ties with USC administration and a new $70,000 grant for the USC Student Basic Needs Fund. 
Stone addressed the dire circumstances students, faculty and staff have endured with the coronavirus pandemic, which led USC to move classes online for the rest of the semester. 
“This is truly emblematic of a unique year in the history of USC and the world,” Stone said. “We come together online tonight to reflect on a year of triumph and struggle, fighting on through it all. And for this I’m humbled and grateful to have had the opportunity to represent USC’s 20,000 undergraduate students through this challenging, and yet, transformative year.” 
Stone also reflected on his and Vice President Mahin Tahsin’s campaign slogan “It’s Time,” through which they looked to create new initiatives within USC with the help of student groups, trustees and senior administrators, which they said they received under President Carol Folt’s new leadership. 
“‘It’s Time’ suggested our commitment to helping turn a new page at USC, to make amends for systemic misconduct,” Stone said. “To make values-based leadership the bedrock of this institution and to rebuild and reinstate trust in a community shaken by scandal.”
Stone spoke on what he said he believed to be USG’s key accomplishments: strengthening student government, expanding student support resources and building unity.  
Although this in-person academic year has been shortened, USG was able to use its $2.4 million budget to host 255 events with more than 51,000 attendees and reduce administrative expenses to redirect to programming and funding branches, pointing to one of USG’s strengths, Stone said.  
Stone also emphasized USG’s efforts to increase student body representation by creating the Student Assembly for Accessibility. A bylaw was also passed in early February to establish new procedures to easen the measures in place for cultural groups to become assemblies, affecting groups such as the Military Associated Student Assembly, the Native American Student Assembly and the Middle Eastern and North African Student Assembly. 
Through another bylaw passed in Tuesday’s USG meeting, Stone and his team were also able to begin their restructuring initiative to reduce the USG branches into three — executive, legislative and judicial — that will provide about 20 more leadership positions. Previously, USG was composed of executive, legislative, advocacy, communications, funding and programming branches. Stone also highlighted the communication branch’s efforts to provide outreach to students. 
“In all, USG’s 113 members work together to build a better USG,” Stone said. “They did so to strengthen our position as a trusted campus partner and advocate for students, building onto our foundational goal to engage and empower undergraduate students.”
Stone said that in this past year, USG has prioritized well-being and basic needs by expanding student resources including the $20,000 grant to USC Student Health for free HIV testing, expanding the Freshman Forgiveness policy to first-year transfer students and sustainability programs including compost bins and the Divest SC campaign. 
Stone also announced that USG will be providing a $70,000 grant for the Student Basic Needs Fund amid the coronavirus pandemic. Funding for the grant comes after various student events, including SpringFest, were canceled. 
With regard to building unity, Stone said that USG has made an effort to strengthen ties within USC by having students involved in hiring decisions for positions such as provost, athletic director and vice president of enrollment management, as well as an advisory council for President Folt and Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp. Stone pointed out that the current USG administration saw the first-ever student presentation to the Board of Trustees, led by Stone, Mahin and the Graduate Student Government to discuss the transfer forgiveness program and CalFresh subsidies.
“With direct channels of communication and frequent meetings with senior administrators and trustees, the voice of students at the highest levels of university governance has never been stronger,” Stone said. 
Although the student body and USG have seen various achievements, they have also faced plenty of struggle throughout the past year, Stone said. However, even with admissions scandals and campus tragedies with nine student deaths last fall, students remained resilient. 
“As a student body, we have emulated what it means to fight on, to unify as a family of Trojans and to persevere together,” Stone said. “And as we renewed our hope with the start of a new decade, we have persevered through many of our most daunting challenges. 
As USC community members continue to face uncertainty and anxiety with the current coronavirus crisis, Stone called on students to continue to be leaders in their communities.
“The state of USG is strong, not only because of the diverse range of backgrounds of our members, but because of their unified commitment to serve the student body and the world,” Stone said.

When junior Sandra Olmedo returned home March 12 from studying abroad in Madrid, she was scared for her mother’s health. After self-isolating in her Los Angeles home for three days, she called Student Health and said that although she was asymptomatic, she was afraid she could be a carrier and unknowingly transmit it to her immunocompromised mother. 
A day later, she checked into USC Hotel. Olmedo described the 12-day stay on the sixth floor of the hotel  as lonesome.
Unable to walk outside or interact face-to-face with anyone for the duration of her quarantine, she often opened the room’s windows, taking comfort in the limited sun and fresh air and listening to the busy streets, all while measuring her temperature every day and speaking with Student Health representatives every weekday to update them on her symptoms. 
“It was really just trying to make a routine for myself, taking advantage of the amenities in the room like the TV and WiFi,” Olmedo said. “Just making time go by as much as I could.” 
She was also provided free room service, $400 in Grubhub gift credit and given cleaning supplies to disinfect her room to avoid putting the hotel workers at risk. Still, she was constantly worried of symptoms appearing, especially since Student Health was only testing those with severe symptoms. Her only symptom was a slight dry cough. 
“I didn’t get to get tested, which was kind of frustrating because I didn’t know if I had it or not. I should technically be fine… but not knowing for sure is a point of anxiety for me,” said Olmedo, who has since returned home. 
Another student, who asked to remain anonymous because he violated social distancing protocol, described his experience at the hotel differently. Arriving back from his Rome study abroad trip in early March, the student asked to be accommodated at USC Hotel, as classes had not yet been moved online. 
“I pushed to go back to L.A. because I, at the time, didn’t think that campus would take the steps that it has,” the student said. “I wanted to be part of campus life still, even in the event that I could not attend my classes in person.” 
On his flight back to L.A., the student expected to receive continued guidance about testing and the quarantine period but was met with limited aid, he said. 
“I was supposed to get a call [from Student Health] — and nothing,” he said. “They should have just told me ‘You know what, I’m sorry,  you can’t come back to school right now.’ That would have sucked, but at least I would have understood it. But I was told that I could come back.” 
As the coronavirus pandemic evolved during Olmedo’s stay, the hotel implemented new protocols. After Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home mandate, Olmedo said she noticed activity in the hotel, including room and food service, decrease. 
“Before the [stay-at-home] order, Grubhub people could come [to the floor], my parents would come up,” Olmedo said. “After the shutdown, they stopped letting people come up, and it would just have to be the workers.” 
Yaneth, a housekeeper at the hotel who asked that her last name be ommited out of concern for her job, said initially only room service personnel were informed about students self-quarantining at the hotel. However, after a room service worker misrepresented the situation to other employees, hotel management held a meeting to inform the rest of the staff that students were being quarantined out of precaution. 
“For our safety, we weren’t allowed to [go up to the floor] — only room service was allowed to leave the food at their doors,” Yaneth said in Spanish. “There was bags [available for each students’ trash]. All the food was in disposable kitchenware.” 
Although Yaneth worked in housekeeping, she did not interact directly with the self-quarantining students. As the situation continued, she and her co-workers were assigned less work each day. 
“We didn’t have anything to do on those floors, our work in a sense slowed down,” Yaneth said. “As co-workers, all of us looked out for each other and protected each other and had cleaning supplies, masks, gloves to protect us from any situation.” 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Deona Willes, safety director for Environmental Health and Safety, said USC Hotel has since minimized workers’ contact with students. By creating a virtual contact list, students were able to check into the hotel without any in-person contact. More thorough cleanings have also been implemented in high-traffic areas in the hotel and across campus. 
The student who requested anonymity said he often left the hotel to meet friends but did not enter campus. 
“[Student Health] highly suggested that I stay inside my [room],” he said. “I won’t lie — I definitely left. It was a little bit selfish on my part … but there was no guard at the door.”  
Olmedo, who stayed at the hotel throughout her quarantine, said that the initial letter she received from Student Health during her stay seemed to only suggest that students remain in their rooms. She later received stricter guidelines from Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp. 
“I would agree with [the anonymous student] that at the beginning, especially the first few days I was there, it did feel like a suggestion — the only explicit rule was to not go onto USC campus,” Olmedo said. “Later on, we got a different letter, and it was more strict.”
In the letter, Crisp instructed students to follow social distancing guidelines and stated that those who did not would face disciplinary action. 
“In order to effectively help us protect the community, we need all residents to follow the social distancing guidelines,” the letter read. “Failure to do so endangers those around you and will not be tolerated … Please be advised that any violation of the University’s Student Conduct Code … can and will result in disciplinary conduct proceedings.”
Although limited resources prevent the hotel from enforcing self-quarantine measures, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said she hopes those at the hotel follow social distancing guidelines.
“We don’t really have the resources to monitor people, nor should I believe in any way that we should have to monitor people to do what is not only the legal but also the ethical and the moral thing to do,” Van Orman said.
While no systemwide security measures were put in place, Olmedo recalled overhearing a conversation her friend had with a hotel worker who asked her to return to her room after she left to collect ice from a machine on their floor. 
“They were all very nice,” Olmedo said. “I could hear from my door that an interaction was going on outside, and they were just like, ‘I’m sorry, you need to go back to your room … Whatever you need, we’ll take it to you — just don’t leave your room.’” 
The student who wished to remain anonymous left his self-isolation period four days before it was complete and said he received limited help from the University to secure housing. Now in New York, the student said he believes the University forced him to relocate to a region that faces worse conditions than both L.A. and Rome. Currently, New York has nearly 76,000 cases, while the full country  of Italy has more than 105,000. L.A. County currently has more than 3,000 cases.
“Objectively, USC has put me closer to this two times over,” he said. “Say what you will with it being in my home, that’s fine, but I also paid for housing … In an ideal world, I would have liked to stay in L.A., even during this whole situation. It’s better for me professionally, personally, mentally, emotionally … and I expressed that to them.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Ho said all room spaces at the hotel are currently reserved for University students and employees. A new program, called Care for the Caregiver, will accommodate Health Sciences Campus employees who live far from campus or cannot return home for fear of spreading the virus to their households.
“[The hotel houses] people who are returning from studying abroad and many of those people were also self-isolating,” Van Orman told the Daily Trojan. “It might be someone who needs to self-isolate but has nowhere to go … The really important role that the hotel will be playing in the coming weeks … is to provide a place for our healthcare workers who are working at Keck Medicine.” 
According to an email to the Daily Trojan from Executive Director of USC Hospitality and USC Hotel Dirk De Jong, guest reservations were canceled following Folt and Zukoski’s memo March 13 and will not resume until April 14. Students, employees and a faculty member are the only current occupants of the hotel. 
A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed information to Executive Director of Marketing and Communications for USC Student Health Minne Ho. The information was provided by Safety Director for Environmental Health and Safety Deona Willes. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Erin Pugh knows she’s a rarity. Not only is she the single Black woman on USC’s AeroDesign Team, but the Chicago native’s love for complex calculations and manga comics also set her apart. 
Pugh found her niche in ADT and will serve as the team’s landing gear captain for the 2020-21 school year, stepping into the role of a leader.  But she didn’t always find that her peers understood her passions and interests. Her hobbies and her involvement in aerospace aren’t run-of-the-mill for her Chicago friend group.
 “I go to the comic book club, I read comics, I watch anime, I read mangas,” said Pugh, a third-year student majoring in mathematics and aerospace, detailing her nerdiness. While her love for Japanese novelties are regular pastimes to many, it isn’t for many of her hometown peers. Questions of “Who’s your favorite rapper?” or  “Who’s your favorite basketball player?” are what is traded among her friends.
 “It was more beat into our brains that you should like Black people things,” Pugh said. She was called  “nerdy” or a “know-it-all” for her love of planes. “Planes are not Black people things.” 
Luckily, in coming to USC and joining the AeroDesign Team in Fall 2018, Pugh found an opportunity to express her affinity for STEM with like-minded students who also knew the difference between a Boeing 747, 737 MAX and a 777 aircraft. 
In short, the team builds model airplanes according to a set of rules and guidelines by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and participates in the annual AIAA Design/Build/Fly competition. 
On the team, Pugh focuses her energy on the payloads committee. She and other members build out the carrying capacity of an aircraft, aligning directly with her goal of working at Boeing once she graduates. 
But beyond getting her hands dirty with wood, foam and plastic — common materials used in making model aircrafts — and winning the “Best Report” award in 2019’s competition, Pugh has found her home in the team.
“It’s like a family type of thing,” Pugh said. “You find people that are like you, but they’re from different backgrounds.”
The comfort Pugh found in ADT is far from her early experiences as a Trojan. Transferring from Governor State University, a smaller public school located 40 miles south of Chicago, to USC in 2018 was no small feat.
“I was the smartest person at my college — [I] had to be,” Pugh said, comparing USC to GSU — all while touting that she graduated from high school at 16. “You can’t give GSU effort at USC … [When] a paper is due, I can’t wait until the night before to do it.”
And it’s no surprise the campus climate was also different from her native Chi-town. 
“I’m from Chicago, where it’s all Black,” Pugh said. “The South Side. Oh my God, it was a cultural shock.” 
The differences in rigor and culture aren’t the only challenges she faced; finding her footing and support proved just as difficult. 
“At my first college I had somebody that was a mentor to me,” Pugh said. “[They] really pushed me to do aerospace and get out of that college and come to USC.”
But upon arrival, she struggled in the math department as she sought a double major in math and aerospace engineering, lacking the same support she had previously received.
“[At first I was] like, ‘Oh yeah, I could definitely do this,’” Pugh said. “But then it was kind of discouraging to see that nobody in the math department was really trying to catch me and put me under their wing — [the] type of thing that I was used to.” 
Finally mustering up the courage, Pugh started to take aerospace-focused classes where she met her new-found mentor and ADT faculty adviser Charles Radovich, an associate professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering practice. As Pugh’s professor for “Introduction to Aerospace Engineering,” Radovich pointed Pugh in the right direction, encouraging her to participate in more STEM-related extracurriculars. 
“[Radovich] basically kept me under his wing and is still helping me to this day to try to find internships [and] try to do more in Viterbi,” Pugh said.
Radovich, who studied aerospace engineering at USC and graduated in 2002, described himself as a candid professor. 
“I’m not here to be friends, but I want to give [my students] honest feedback,” Radovich said. “I really feel like I’m here to make them good engineers.” 
Part of this honesty comes from his candid conversations with students about how he struggled as an undergrad at USC, resonating directly with Pugh’s experience. 
“I let them know I struggled or how I used to sit in Leavey Library for a lot of hours until I figured out how to do this,” Radovich said. “It didn’t just come naturally. But I had to put in work.”
Radovich’s mentorship also helped Pugh gather a sense of belonging in her studies. With USC’s Black population sitting at 5% and a 2019 study published in the Education Researcher journal reporting Black and Latinx college students transferring or dropping out of STEM programs at higher rates than their white peers, it was affirming advice. 
“You deserve to be here, and there’s not a lot of people that look like you who are here,” Pugh said Radovich told her. In her early ADT days, she stood out, looking very different from some of her plane-loving peers. 
“I usually wear my big hair and makeup,” Pugh said. “And I’m real cute, period … I remember coming to ADT and one of the freshmen was like, ‘Are you supposed to be here? Are you lost?’”
The ‘Othering’ Pugh experienced early at USC is not a unique one for many Black women in STEM. USC alumna Avri Parker remembers she, too, felt like an outsider in her computer science classes. 
Coming to USC in 2015 as a computer science and business administration major, Parker knew her coursework would be challenging. Though she’d taken computer science classes in high school, Viterbi School of Engineering’s classrooms were a new beast; Parker described her classes as “siloed,” with little opportunities for collaborative work and lacking women and people of color. 
“It was just hard in all ways,” Parker said. “There’s no socializing, there’s no Black people, there’s barely any women, and it was just difficult as fuck.”
Lacking a sense of community in her classes, Parker leaned on USC’s National Society of Black Engineers for support. 
“That was the only time we could see anybody who looked like [ourselves],” she said, speaking of their general body meetings or the times they would study collaboratively.
The student group aims to foster community among Black engineers, traveling to annual conferences, hosting career-related events and even fundraising parties.
“No matter if you were CS or not, you were probably one of very few [Black people] in your major,” said Parker, who served as the organization’s president. “I think that’s why we were all so close to each other. We were really all we had.”
Just as Parker found comradery in NSBE, Pugh found a comrade in her classes: Mikell Myers, a sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering and the other Black student in ADT.
“You know when it’s only one Black person in the classroom you go sit by them?” Pugh said of their first encounter. “That’s how it was when I first met him.” 
The two initially bonded over inside jokes relating to “urban grit,” as Myers, the Baltimore native, described it. Myers called Pugh an “incognito nerd,” raved about her ever-present smile and how he looks to her as someone who’s unafraid to be themselves no matter the setting. 
“[Pugh’s] presence [in ADT] is a plus because she’s really taking a step,” said Myers, speaking on Pugh’s status as the only Black woman on the team. “She’s unapologetically herself.”
And ever since they met in their major’s introductory course, Myers and Pugh have served as each other’s support systems.
But of all the connections and relationships Pugh made in her aerospace pursuits, one of the most profound is hers with her father, a trained engineer. For a while, Pugh didn’t speak to her dad after her parents’ divorce but remembers times when they bonded over the shared passion. 
“I would sit there and watch him fix cars in our garage … We used to play basketball every Sunday,” she said. Pugh becomes annoyed when she’s reminded that, though their relationship may not be perfect, he “blessed [her] with the genes of having a photographic memory.” 
Despite their rocky relationship, Pugh knows he’s proud of her because of their shared love for engineering and desires to make amends. 
“My grandma tells me he’s so proud of me because [I] took on something that he did,’” Pugh said. “I wish I could hopefully have a better relationship with him now that I’m about to graduate.”
Graduating in either 2021 or 2022 depending on the courses she’ll take over the next few semesters, Pugh has her eyes set on working at Boeing or at another aircraft manufacturing company who will fund her secondary education. 
Outside of her professional ambitions, Pugh finds it important to guarantee her future children an even better reality than her own. 
“I want to make sure that I’m financially stable enough to basically be Batman,” Pugh said. “I want to be like rich rich, so then my kids have to want for nothing.” 
But along with her ambitions comes the harsh reality of being a woman of color in STEM. With Black women only earning 62% of white men’s salary in STEM industries, according to the Pew Research Center, her financial woes are founded. 
“I’m, one, a woman and, two, I’m Black,” Pugh said. “So my pay might be lower than someone who graduated with a bachelor’s and is doing the same job as me, but is white and a man.”
Despite the sobering truth for many Black women in her industry, Pugh is excited for what lies ahead in her career. Looking towards the future she says: “God, please let me own my own airline and own my own aerospace company.”

The prospect of receiving a red acceptance package with a certificate of admission is a moment many USC applicants look forward to after putting in sleepless nights of work for their acceptance. 
The Class of 2024 received admission decisions online Thursday but will miss out on many of the programs that help make college decisions easier, including in-person campus tours and events for admitted students. The University is now hosting these events virtually to give prospective students a glimpse of campus life.  
Chloe Tran, a senior at Temple City High School and the daughter of two USC alumni, had her heart set on USC since the age of 2. Her parents would take her to the University’s homecoming football games each year and where she dreamed of joining the student section. 
“I’ve been wanting to get into USC for a while now,” Tran said. “I was on FaceTime with a friend [when I got my decision], and I made them look first, and they’re like, ‘I can’t see it.’ So I looked, and I saw it, and I was in shock … I started crying.”
Tran, who plans to major in sociology, said she visited campus last September but wishes for the chance to explore it on her own before coming to campus in the fall. She added that she’s missing out on receiving the acceptance package. 
“I guess I am a little sad because to see it physically, I feel like to have it in hand is so much more real,” Tran said. “But I understand the reasoning behind it [because of] the virus.”
Ini Obong, a senior at Arizona State University Preparatory School, said she is not only missing out on a traditional senior year with prom and senior night but also on a normal freshman experience. 
“All that new college freshman stuff that I don’t really get to experience like everyone else did really sucks because it’s really only our class this has ever happened to,” Obong said. “No one really knows what’s going on, and it’s just really hectic. No one prepares for this, obviously, so I don’t know how to react.”     
Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said that while the circumstances are not ideal, USC has moved admitted student sessions online and is trying to support prospective students through general information sessions, financial aid panels and student services panels with USC Housing and Residential Education. 
“Whether it’s virtual or in person, it’s all about meeting each other,” Brunold said. “It’s all about making sure that people have the information that they need, and we’re very much committed to that, so I’m optimistic about these sessions.”
Madeline Abiera, a senior at the Orange County School of the Arts, said her acceptance to the School of Cinematic Arts brightened the period of quarantine. Despite missing out on typical prospective student experiences, Abiera said she is excited to join USC.
“I’m trying my best to be understanding of the situation [because] I know it’s out of most people’s control,” Abiera said. “The only thing we can do is just be aware of ourselves and do everything we can to prevent this [pandemic] from getting worse.” 
Abiera said even with limited options, admitted students have started interacting with each other through social media to celebrate their acceptance to the University. 
“I’ve already started meeting a lot of other [admitted] students through Instagram and group chats on GroupMe, which is really cool,” Abiera said. “I’m starting to get to know some people before we even get to do these admitted students events, so we are finding our own ways to stay connected during this time.” 
Brunold said informational sessions will be held via Zoom and other virtual platforms at different times of day to accommodate international students’ varied time zones. He added that regional hangouts, aimed at bringing students from similar geographic areas together, would be held in addition to specific sessions aimed at first-generation, marginalized, spring-admitted and international students. 
“We know that students have been preparing for this next step in their educational journey for literally their entire lives to this point, and there’s really no reason why anyone should imagine that their studies would have to be interrupted,” Brunold said. “Regardless of what happens, USC is committed to do it doing the best that it can to continue to educate and support students.” 
First-year incoming students are usually expected to submit final transcripts before joining USC but have been granted an extension until the end of Fall 2020 with exams around the world getting postponed or canceled. While Advanced Placement exams will still be held online, international tests such as International Baccalaureate and A-Level tests have been canceled.  
While the University deadline to commit remains May 1, the frequently asked questions section on the admitted student website states that extensions would be considered on a case-by-case basis for extenuating circumstances.
