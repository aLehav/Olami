The USC women’s basketball team started its season with a 93-66 home win in an exhibition game against Biola University Tuesday night.
“We still got a long way to go, but this was a pretty good first step we took,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.
Senior center Kari LaPlante led the Women of Troy with 20 points. Overall, five USC players scored in double digits — freshman forward Cassie Harberts (14), freshman guard Len’Nique Brown (11), sophomore forward Christina Marinacci (17) and redshirt junior Jacki Gemelos (12).
LaPlante made back-to-back baskets and junior guard Ashley Corral hit a three-pointer to put the Eagles, members of the Golden State Athletic Conference in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, in a 20-9 hole within the game’s first seven minutes. Biola fought back to tie the game at 24 before the Women of Troy pulled away once again, this time for good.
“We just needed to buckle down and focus,” LaPlante, who had seven rebounds and four steals to go along with her 20 points, said. “We took their first punch and ran with it.”
Corral buried another three-pointer with 6:25 left in the half to extend the lead to 30-26. Right before the halftime buzzer, the Women of Troy worked a textbook pick-and-roll as Brown found LaPlante rolling off the pick and fed her down the lane for a layup to make the score 44-33.
The Eagles never cut the lead below double digits for the rest of the game.
“We have to be a defensive-minded team,” Cooper said. “When we played defense like we did the first few minutes of the game, we were up 20-9. Then all of a sudden we just got away from that and started going strictly on our offense. We just can’t afford to do that.”
The Trojans’ defense forced the Eagles into committing 25 turnovers, and seven different players had steals for the team. The Women of Troy capitalized on those mistakes, turning those Eagles turnovers into 27 USC points.
Another strength for the Women of Troy was their domination of the paint throughout the game. They outscored the Eagles 46-20 in the paint and outrebounded them, 41-26.
“We’ve been working a lot with rebounding because that’s something we’ve had trouble with in the past,” LaPlante said.
LaPlante’s seven rebounds led the team, but all five starters were productive on the boards as each recorded at least four rebounds.
Corral picked up where she left off last season, leading the Women of Troy with nine assists. Gemelos dished a few passes off herself, finishing with four assists.
The Women of Troy face off against No. 22 Gonzaga on Friday at the Galen Center to mark the official beginning of the regular season. Cooper thinks his team is up to the challenge, as long as it focuses on one particular aspect of its game.
“We have to play tough defense for 40 minutes. … When we do that, we’re a pretty good team,” Cooper said.

With a key matchup against No. 18 Arizona on the road this weekend, the Trojans will need all their weapons to be sharp to avenge last season’s loss.
Back for more · Freshman wide receiver Robert Woods was limited by illness versus Arizona State but will play against Arizona. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
That includes freshman receiver Robert Woods.
After starting off the year at a blistering rate — returning a 97-yard kick for a touchdown to put the Trojans up for good against Minnesota, and recording 19 catches for 340 yards and five touchdowns in a two-game span against Stanford and California — the freshman star has fallen off the radar.
He did have a team-high seven catches for 59 yards against Oregon, but no touchdowns. He only recorded three catches for 17 yards last week against Arizona State because he wasn’t at full strength, as he had to be taken to the hospital because of vomiting and back pain Thursday.
With Woods limited, the Sun Devils were able to double-team senior receiver Ronald Johnson, and the offense struggled to find a rhythm.
“You could feel it out there,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “When both of those guys are healthy, you feel that speed presence out there and aggressiveness and there’s deeper safeties. If one of them is banged up or one of them is out, like Robert was in that game, you can feel that we have some really good receivers but [Robert and Johnson] are really fast  so I can definitely feel when one’s not there.”
Woods was limited in practice Tuesday and said he hasn’t been sick since Friday, but he should be close to full strength this weekend.
“I feel all right,” Woods said. “A little pain here and there, but I feel like I could go. It was coach’s decision to sit me out [Tuesday]. ”
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, who missed a wide-open Woods on a deep ball on the first series of the Arizona State game, one of the few times that game Woods looked like his former self, said his absence affects the passing game.
“He being out, you could see the effects of it,” Barkley said. “He’s still getting there, still trying to get back to 100 percent. But he’s playing his butt off still. There’s no doubt about his effort. But I definitely missed him out there.”
u
Freshman running back Dillon Baxter got the first start of his career Saturday with mixed results. He rushed a team-high 17 times but mustered only 52 yards and had four catches for 26 yards.
“The running was pretty good,” Baxter said. “There was a couple backside plays I could’ve got. But it was my first time and everything. I think I got in the groove pretty good for my first time.”
Kiffin said he was impressed that in Baxter’s 17 carries he didn’t have one negative run. One area Baxter and Kiffin both see a need for improvement, however, is Baxter’s pass protection. Baxter missed a block on a play-action pass in the second quarter that caused Barkley to run out of the pocket and throw an interception in the end zone.
“I’m disappointed in the pass protection on the play that ended up being the interception because that’s the exact same protection he missed at home versus Virginia,” Kiffin said. “Same protection, same guy and he missed him, and we threw an interception on that one because [Barkley] rushed it.”
As for Baxter’s counterpart, junior running back Marc Tyler said he felt fine Tuesday after spraining his ankle in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s game and should practice this week.

The word “leadership” is a difficult one to gauge.
Plug it into a Yahoo! Images search and you’ll be greeted with a Bill Clinton poster, a slew of penguins marching and a compass unsure of its own direction.
Fearless leader · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley has done well this season on the field but continues to shine even brighter off it. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Peruse your nearest trusty dictionary and it’ll likely show an archaic definition such as: “The process of social influence in which one person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task.”
Sure, these two methods will give you some sort of idea about what the word loosely represents, but both miss the mark when trying to decipher just how a 20-year-old quarterback with bleached-blond hair and the calmness of a native Southern Californian can lead an illustrious program through one of its darkest hours.
The phrase “poster boy” doesn’t do justice to the role sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley has been asked to play since stepping onto campus two years ago.
From billboards to jerseys to overpriced memorabilia, there is very little in the athletic program that doesn’t have some bearing of Barkley’s name, photograph or signature on it.
So why does the sophomore deserve such adoration and promotion?
If you look simply at the on-field performance, the answer won’t likely be found.
But patrol the sidelines during practice or listen in on any team meeting, and it’s the typically laid-back Barkley who quickly commands the respect of all teammates within earshot.
It’s largely assumed that a player in Barkley’s shoes automatically takes to the role of team leader. Look beyond the captain’s patch adorning the jersey of the Trojans’ quarterback and you’ll see that the distinguished title didn’t choose him; he chose it.
“I think I am naturally a leader by example,” Barkley said. “I am always just trying to do the right thing and show other people by my actions what needs to be done. With my experiences last year, it has really helped me grow into a vocal leader.”
Yet, behind the standard pride and honor that comes with being named a team captain, there exists a unique sincerity to Barkley that shouldn’t be overlooked because of one pent-up fanatical frustration over a late-game interception or failed offensive series.
Success between the lines is still a week-to-week challenge for the former Mater Dei standout. For every crisp throw over the middle of the defense, the still-maturing gunslinger forces a ball into double coverage. And in a year where underclassmen have taken control of the weekly headlines, Barkley and the hype that surrounds his every move have taken a noticeable backseat.
For an athlete whose ego has been stroked from day one, you’d suspect the USC quarterback to spend his time clamoring for the spotlight with each passing day.
But Barkley doesn’t.
As he watches his team struggle to find consistency through the first nine games of its topsy-turvy season, you’d assume he’d likely be consumed by the thought of greener pastures such as the NFL.
But Barkley isn’t.
Where capturing awards, pleasing scouts and garnering national buzz seemingly go hand in hand with the stereotypical label of what it means to be a starting college quarterback at a top-notch program, USC’s steady hand focuses his attention on a much greater task: remaining faithful to the team’s progression on and off the field.
And it is in the moments that test this faith — the kind you won’t find making their way into a Saturday night box score — that truly shine a light on Barkley, the leader.
When senior kicker Joe Houston made kicking field goals in the first half of Saturday’s contest against Arizona State look as painful as Sylvester Stallone attempting to box in Rocky VI, it was Barkley who lent encouragement as a barrage of boos bombarded Houston as he made his way to the sideline.
As Pete Carroll’s get-out-of-Dodge routine took aback an entire team that looked up to the now-Seahawks coach like a father, it was Barkley who faced the uncertainty.
It would have been very easy for the five-star prospect to protect his future from the turmoil that lay ahead of him and his teammates last summer. But instead of fleeing, he relished the opportunity to stay. As he saw it, it was a chance to lay the foundation for the team’s newly redefined identity — one built on strength of character, a collective vision and a steadfast commitment to trusting one another even during trying times.
“I don’t think there are any single guys out there on this time, guys who are looking out for themselves,” Barkley said. “This year we are more united, and after all we’ve been through this off-season, that’s made us stronger as a team.”
Looking at Barkley’s inherent leadership qualities on the football field, however, doesn’t tell you the whole story of the person he is off it.
Although he is the first to admit he is not without flaws, the university’s golden arm puts the finishing touches on a rather impressive leadership-driven poster with a steady dose of community service and outreach to those in need. From volunteer missions in poverty-stricken regions of Mexico, to orphanage visits in South Africa, to helping jumpstart the Monarchs for Marines program for Camp Pendleton soldiers and their families, Barkley’s selfless actions speak for themselves.
“I believe it is our responsibility to give back,” Barkley said. “Here, in Southern California, we are so blessed; those trips give you perspective of how grateful we are to live here. It really opens up your heart. Serving is just one of the best ways I think you can reach out.”
And whether it is his service on the well-cut grass of the Coliseum or out in the community, the image of Barkley, the leader, is cut-and-dry.
Don’t be fooled by his carefree nature, or the laid-back persona he naturally gives off regardless of what the final score reads.
Because regardless of the Saturday night box scores or noticeable mistakes he is going to continue to make during his on-field maturation, Barkley is the straw that stirs USC’s drink.
His ability to lead has nothing to do with his talented right arm or the endless amount of press clippings dedicated to his career, and everything to do with the rare desire and respect he has for what it means to be the field general for USC football.
The Trojans’ 6-3 record might speak to an up-and-down campaign, where stability and unity are about as common as 60 minutes of quality football, but in a year where rebuilding and growth seem to be evident with just four games to play, having No. 7 at the center of progression means having the key to resurrecting the once-storied program in the hands of a well-qualified leader.

I think this article truly hit the mark. A true leader is selfless, kind, caring, and is always there for support. Matt Barkley is the epitome of a true leader and he is such an inspiration to so many. The influence he has on others is what makes him who he is. USC is so lucky to have him to represent their already prestigious school. Thank you for characterizing him so positively.

After a disappointing battle with the elements on day one, the USC men’s golf team put itself in contention to win the Gifford Collegiate Championship in San Martin, Calif., today after a stellar second round. The Trojans grabbed third place on Tuesday, besting their day one score by 27 strokes to jump up three places in the 12-team field.

The Gifford Collegiate Championship is held at the CordeValle Golf Club, a difficult course that proved a test for the team.
“The course is hard. The roughs are really long, so you have to hit straight. It plays tough,” freshman Jeffrey Kang said. Kang, along with freshman Ramsey Sahyoun, posted the lowest scores so far in the tournament for the Trojans.
On day one, the team faced high winds that sent balls careening off course and produced more bogeys than the team has hit all year.
Although there was still wind on day two, the Trojans were able to persevere and ended up at four-under-par 351 as a team, though not a single Trojan dipped under par in the first round. USC trails rival UCLA by just two strokes, and first-place Stanford by 13.
USC was led by Kang and Sahyoun, both of whom shot for two-under-par 69 — collectively 20 strokes better than their first day, when they both shot eight-over-par 79. The pair is caught in a seven-way tie for 24th.
Kang had the most consistent round of the pair, knocking out three birdies in the first nine holes and just a single bogey on the back nine.
“I hit the ball a lot better [Tuesday] than I did [Monday]. It worked out. I felt a lot more comfortable on the course,” Kang said.
Sahyoun had an equally impressive round; he hit two bogeys, two birdies and an eagle — one of three hit by the Trojans on Tuesday.
Next for USC was sophomore Martin Trainer. Trainer had a roller coaster of a round, hitting five bogeys, four birdies and an eagle to end up at a 1-under-par 70. This bumps him up to a tie for seventh place, four places better than his seat after Tuesday’s contest.
Placing fourth on the day was consistent-performer sophomore T.J. Vogel, who hit an even-par 71 to tie for 13th place. Vogel had three bogeys and three birdies, improving his day one score by four strokes.
Next came Junior Steve Lim, who hit his second 1-over-par 72 of the tournament to join Trainer in the top 10 at ninth place. Lim had a tough first five holes — he hit two bogeys and a triple bogey right away and spent the next 13 holes working to bring his score back down. Luckily for the team, Lim hit four birdies to close out the round.
Rounding out the Trojan squad was senior Bo DeHuff, who hit a 7-over-par 78 and sits in 70th place. As the six golfer for the team, DeHuff’s score won’t count.
The Trojans are looking to take their momentum into round three and keep moving up in the rankings.
“[Our goal is to] go as low as possible. You have to be smart playing this course. A lot of us did that pretty well [Tuesday], so we’re gonna try to keep that up and play well [today],” Kang said.
Action concludes Tuesday with the third and final round of play.

A recent study from the Childhood Obesity Research Center at the Keck School of Medicine has found that the high fructose corn syrup used in sugary drinks such as sodas contains a higher level of fructose than previously thought.
Gulp -  Sumit Aggarwal, a second year graduate student studying electrical engineering, drinks soda in the campus center.  A new USC study shows that levels of fructose sugar in soda are higher than originally believed. - Daniel Wang | Daily Trojan
Researchers analyzed the content of 23 different sodas and compared the results to standard samples to determine the levels of various types of sugar, such as fructose and sucrose. The results showed that many of these levels were higher than what the manufacturers reveal and that the total sugar content was generally about 20 percent higher for fructose than the advertised level.
Jaimie Davis, assistant professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine and co-author of the study, said the general assumption prior to the study was that the high fructose corn syrup used to sweeten beverages contained 55 percent fructose.
The fructose content of foods and beverages containing high fructose corn syrup is not disclosed by manufacturers, and Davis said this assumed 55 percent figure raised questions among researchers who studied fructose and its effects on the human body.
“For researchers, a lot of times, if we’re doing the analysis to look at the relationship between sugar-sweetened beverages and disease risk, we have to apply this generic 55 percent, because that’s what we’re told is in it,” Davis said. “We’ve always kind of expected that was not correct, and sure enough it’s actually about 65 percent.”
The difference between the assumed and actual fructose levels of high fructose corn syrup raised concerns from experts regarding health problems related to the consumption of excessive fructose, Davis said.
“It’s only a 10 percent difference, but it could actually dramatically affect the differences in causing disease in kids,” she said.
Increased consumption of sugars, especially fructose, has been linked to side effects including various metabolic disorders. For young children, the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increases dramatically with a diet high in sugars.
“The latest reports suggest that if you were born in the year 2000, you have a 33 percent chance of developing Type 2 diabetes in your lifetime,” Davis said. “As obesity rises, we’re going to see a tremendous shift in diseases related to obesity and people are going to start living shorter life spans.”
“Unless we change the trend of obesity, and change it drastically, we are looking at major health issues affecting our population — our children and adults,” she added.
Although the results of the study revealed the high levels of sugar in drinks such as soda, Davis stressed that the study was indicative of a larger trend throughout the food and beverage industries and American consumers.
“We need to take a little more caution and really look at the types of sugar and amount of sugar that’s in our products,” Davis said. “Just because the label says one thing doesn’t necessarily mean we should take it at face value. As consumers, a lot of times we don’t know what’s going into our food and beverages.”
Even in stores where the ingredients are labeled on the sides of food products, Davis said, consumers still don’t truly know everything about their food because it is usually very highly refined.
“Anytime you look at anything you buy from the store, it has 50 ingredients in it,” Davis said. “We’re getting away from real food and drinking water. We’re consuming a lot of different highly refined and highly sweetened products.”
Davis said she hoped the results of the Center’s study will illustrate the extent of the problems faced by American consumers and inspire changes to reverse some of the developing unhealthy trends.
“It takes changes at every level — at the individual level, at the family level, the community level, and up to large industry and ultimately policy, and making changes at a much larger scale,” Davis said. “We need to think across systems to solve this — doing interventions with just kids, just parents or just the community is not going to do it.”
Not only is this a terrible headline… but high fructose corn syrup isn’t even a sugar.
55%–>65 may be a 10 percentage point increase, but it represents a greater increase in the
amount of fructose. Specifically 65/55 = 1.18
 18% more fructose  than what the CRA claims they are using to sweeten soda. 
Also, that means  there is a 30% more fructose than sucrose sweetened soda.
I really hope another academic institution repats the analysis.  I’d really like to see the tail
pinned on this donkey.
Wow. I’ve got to admit, I definitely didn’t see that one coming. Good thing the researchers are on the case.
Whoever titled this article is an idiot.
haha, who wrote this? someone who works for The Onion
I agree.  Terrible title.  Needs to be a lot less general.

USC’s Men CARE held its first service event in the community Saturday to benefit a nearby women’s shelter, the Jenesse Center Inc.
From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., members asked customers entering Pavilions on Vine Street if they would consider purchasing an extra item to benefit the shelter. They passed out fliers that contained a list of what the shelter needed — mostly nonperishable food, cleaning supplies, hygiene items and school supplies — and information about domestic violence.
“Doing a supply drive lets us raise the projects that domestic violence needs, but it also lets us educate people about domestic violence in a casual and informal way,” said Todd Henneman, assistant director of the Center for Women and Men and adviser to Men CARE.

Men CARE President Cameron Sabol, a senior majoring in physics/computer science and electrical engineering, suggested that the group do a service event in the community last year and found the Pavilions location.
At the event, Men CARE ran out of fliers and boxes for the goods they collected.
“I had varying expectations because we had heard of other groups who had done this before who had said, ‘Oh, we got a ton of stuff,’ but this being our first time doing it, we weren’t really sure what would happen,” Sabol said.
The Jenesse Center was started in 1980 by five survivors of domestic abuse and is the oldest domestic violence center in South Los Angeles. It has a 24/7 hotline and offers a variety of services, including counseling, healthcare and transportation.
“We wanted to use a place that served the community around USC,” Henneman said. “The Jenesse Center offers emergency housing as well as temporary housing so that victims can rebuild their lives. It also provides legal services as well as educational programs to help women and children establish new starts.”
All of Men CARE’s members participated in the event. Henneman said that it was a testament to the group’s dedication that it was working on a game day — “a sacred day at USC.”
“The event [Saturday] didn’t cost USC or students anything — just volunteer time — but we’ve literally collected hundreds and hundreds of dollars for the community. It shows what students can do when they think creatively and want to help the community,” Henneman said.
Vice President of Membership Michael Vasquez, a junior majoring in health promotion and American Studies, said the event also displays how service-oriented USC has become.
“We had UCLA people come by and say, ‘Oh, they’re from the University of Spoiled Children,’” Vasquez said. “But I said, ‘Actually, it’s the University of Service to the Community.’”
The group has plans to continue the event in the future, possibly once a month. It has received approval to ask for donations for the Jenesse Center and the Ralphs on Adams Boulevard and Vermont Avenue.
USC Men CARE has spoken with middle and high school students about domestic violence and often hosts speakers on men’s and women’s issues but has never held an event specifically directed at the community surrounding USC.
“I feel like it really opens up your perspective,” said Gabriel Si, vice president of finance and a senior majoring in neurobiology. “Sometimes we might be a little closed in and not recognize a lot of things that are going on. Seeing all these people who are willing to help is really a great thing.”
The Center for Women and Men also provides services to students who grew up in abusive homes or have experienced dating violence. Support is available to all students. male or female.
V.P. Biden recently called violence against women, “the very worst abuse.”  The very worst abuse is valuing one life less than another for having been born the wrong sex. Under Biden’s Violence Against Women Act the wrong sex is men.  Shelter and services are virtually non-existent for male victims of domestic violence so those options out of a bad relationship, that are routinely available to women, are very often not available to men. Men wind up gender profiled and often falsely accused by the taxpayer funded, d.v. industry, because of gender feminist ideology controlling the d.v. industry.  Men are often battered by domestic violence, and then battered again by the taxpayer funded, domestic violence industry as shown in “Los Misandry” at Youtube.
Governor Schwarzenegger has to be commended for making a very wise, sound decision in restoring funding for battered women shelters. Without a shelter for a battered woman to go to, she could be killed or severely beaten. This is a very important point that Governor Schwarzenegger recognized. Most men are bigger than women. This is a reverse decision for Governor Schwarzenegger and this decision shows that the Governor has a flexible mind to do what is right.    Well done!  Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger!    You have saved the lives of many battered women.  If a husband has plans to kill his wife, beware, the “Terminator will be Back.”

Fulfilling his goals to interact with students, President C.L. Max Nikias shared his plans for the university with students Tuesday at this semester’s final Campus Conversations Series event held in The Forum.
Open up · After receiving the idea from USG, President C.L. Nikias said he plans to deliver a speech to an all-student audience on Feb. 1. - Carlos Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Hosted by the Office of Campus Activities, the event began with Nikias delivering what he said was not a speech but remarks followed by a 30-minute question-and-answer session during which Nikias walked among the crowd and answered questions.
“He was remarkably engaging,” said Chris Cheng, president of Undergraduate Student Government. “He was weaving in and out of the crowd. There’s no better way to hear feedback from the university than to hear it from the students.”
Nikias, born on the island of Cyprus, said his parents’ passion for education instilled in him a similar drive for learning, which guides many of his goals for the university.
“I advise you to develop an appreciation for the arts. They are couriers, messengers of core values of who we are as human beings,” Nikias, who created the arts and humanities initiative Visions and Voices, said. “Through the arts, you can become a much more complete human being.”
He also advised students on the importance of constantly reading books despite having busy schedules and promised to post to the president’s Facebook page during the month of April his recommendations of books to read over the summer.
Cheng asked Nikias about how he plans to maintain a close relationship with students throughout his tenure
“What I can assure you is that as long as I am president of USC, being in close contact with the students is always going to be a priority,” Nikias said. “I would love to hear from you about how I can be closer with the students.”
Nikias announced a speech that he will be giving solely to students on Feb. 1 at 4 p.m. —  an idea he said he received from USG earlier in the year during an afternoon tea meeting, which he holds with various campus groups each month.
“It’s not just him throwing his message out. It’s a two-way initiative,” Cheng said.
Cheng said that it was wonderful to hear that Nikias listened to his suggestion to address students directly.
One piece of advice Nikias gave students was to explore classes outside of their majors and find something to be passionate about to study.
“Being in a university environment, you’ve got to let your imagination fly,” Nikias said. “It’s OK to experiment and it’s OK to take some risks, and like any other experiment, some experiments succeed and some experiments fail, but it’s OK.”
Nikias said he plans to strengthen the relationship with the community surrounding campus and has already visited 10 of the 15 schools in the USC Family of Schools in order to understand and interact better with the students and faculty in the neighborhood.
“It’s been a wonderful experience for me to visit those schools on their grounds,” Nikias said. “I had a real hard time going to sleep in the evenings. I was having a lot of ideas of what we can do to make a difference, especially for the kids.”
In the spring, Nikias said he will be making two major announcements regarding outreach to the community. First, he will present an initiative that will focus on job training and job creation in the neighborhood, targeting businesses on Vermont Avenue and Figueroa Street.
His second announcement will be his plan to offer the same high-speed Internet access that students use on campus to the 100 homes closest to campus, which will be paid for by the university and free to those community members.
“He’s concerned not just about the academics, but about the community around him,” said Murtaza Najmuddin, a graduate student studying construction management, who attended the event. “It’s all spreading.”
As part of his plan to transform USC into a truly residential university, Nikias said administrators are in the process of finalizing designs involved in the Master Plan to redevelop campus, particularly focusing on the University Village, which  will be remodeled to contain housing specifically for graduate students, retail shops and a gym.
In response to a student who raised concerns about redeveloping the University Village as a completely university space that might exclude the community, Nikias said the university has been receiving input and feedback from the neighborhood as it designs plans for that area.
“I don’t want to see the chains of Armani and Gucci — that’s not the right image that I want to project for the university or for our community. There will be retail stores that are affordable. I don’t want to be selling things that are very expensive, but they will be of good quality,” Nikias said. “We live in a community and we live for a community.”
At the end of the event, the Torch and Tassel chapter of Mortar Board at USC, a senior honor society, presented Nikias with a certificate designating him an honorary member of the USC chapter of the national organization.

“It’s an experiment in meaning,” Ellen Warkentine said to the crowd before a workshop performance of Act 1 of LOLPERA, her opera based on the LOLcats Internet meme. “It’s about seeking truth in places where no truth can be found.”
Then — with nothing but a stripper pole for set design — a group of Long Beach’s bravest artists and musicians launched into a operatic tale in which LOLcats grapple with the reality of social dichotomies, religious persecution and the fruitless search for “cheezburger.”
As Long Beach’s main off-center theater company, The Garage Theatre operates out of a 35-seat black box theater in a strip of small businesses a block away from the Fifth Street Blue Line Station.
Last weekend, the company took a break from preparing its upcoming run of Revenge of the Space Pandas to present a series of sold-out, pay-what-you-can LOLPERA workshops featuring local artists and musicians with the hopes of garnering enough feedback to make the conceptual musical ready for Garage’s yet-to-be-announced 2011 season.
Garage Theatre affiliates Warkentine and co-author Andrew Pedroza — who plays Dreamer Cat (“Golz. I has them,” he says at one point) — have been working on LOLPERA as a humorous side project for several years.
But after raiding the abundance of free-use LOLcat photos and making the opera’s completion a full-time job, the team was ready to see what the public thought of its dramatic first act.
Perched atop a platform to the left of the audience, Warkentine and five other members of the so-called LOLBAND played original musical numbers reminiscent of everything from Randy Newman to Cabaret to Nine Inch Nails.
On the ground, Pedroza and his cat ear-adorned actors (aka the LOLCAST) sang a libretto composed entirely of text from LOLcat images stolen off the Internet, which were projected in-time on the side of the stage.
Every running joke stemming from the LOLcat phenomenon was present and it was eerie how easily these user-generated storylines came together for a coherent operatic arc.
Synopsis: Ceiling Cat is watching you masturbate and Basement Cat wants to steal your soul, so Astro Cat (who runs LOLCat City) goes on a search for cheezburger, which in the LOLPERA could be interpreted as the rough equivalent of Buddhist nirvana.
An epic ideological war ensues in which LOLRUS loses his “bukkit,” Precious Cat just wants it to “be hugs tiem now” and Serious Cat knows that the Internet is “serious business.”
The aria finds Happy Cat — in an effort to convert the others into believing in Ceiling Cat’s powers of salvation — singing “I can has cheezburger” longingly to the heavens. And, in the end, Astro Cat finds a cheezburger, but, lo, Ceiling Cat has been eating one all along.
As nonsensically meta-memetic as LOLPERA might be, in the end, Warkentine’s opening words resonate in both the LOLcats’ world and our own — “truth where no truth can be found.”
By displaying the jumbled aesthetics of our digital age through the lens of the LOLcats spectacle, the entire production mimics our own fruitless searches for meaning and identity on the Internet.
LOLPERA scrolled through hundreds of visual and auditory reappropriations but focused on several LOLcat photos that seemed to hold more significance than most.
Repeated enough times, “Internet. Serious business,” could mean that things we might find frivolous have the capacity for deeper provocation. And after the fifth reprise, “I has a bukkit” is almost an existential statement of possession than a declaration by a happy-go-lucky walrus.
But in the end, there is no other truth except that someone decided to give some funny photos even funnier captions and now there is an opera based on it.
These attempts to find meaning in one of the Internet’s longest-running inside jokes are ones that could only be posed in Los Angeles, a city whose narrative is marred by a similarly futile search for meaning.
Since the entertainment industry became Los Angeles’ central cultural force, much of the academic discourse around the city has been one of LOLCat-worthy confusion. In a land of scripted mirages, what is real and what is imaginary? And is there truth to be found in the grey areas of these ambiguities?
The entire Los Angeles noir film genre is dedicated to finding meaning in a city that eludes even the most tenacious of fictional private investigators. It twists and turns into dark alleys of cases that refuse to be solved. And just when they think they’ve figured it out, they find that the femme fatale isn’t the dame they once thought.
So maybe in a city where (as Harper’s writer once said) “even the bad taste seems to be fake bad taste,” the question is not, “What truth is hidden in LOLcats?” but instead “What truth can we pretend is buried within?”
Sarah Bennett is a senior majoring in communication. Her column, “Fake Bad Taste,” runs Wednesdays.
U r serious writer. Me seez a cheezburger in ur future.
OMG. WTF. This is written so beautifully. Thank you Sarah!
thanks for the thoughtful/intelligent review of our lolpera…  look for act 2 coming soon! :)

For anyone on campus this week, it was hard to miss the large truck with big letters screaming “Fresh Faces” next to a picture of a perfectly retouched model. On Monday and Tuesday, students  got a rare opportunity to participate in Clinique’s Fresh Faces Tour, which it coordinates with Teen Vogue.
Photos by Ted Gerike | Daily Trojan
It was a fun and exciting chance for students to receive the so-called star treatment, as participants got complimentary makeovers, hair styling and professional photo shoots.
This year marks the makeup company’s second annual Fresh Faces Tour. Since mid-September, Clinique makeup artists have  traveled across the country, starting in Boston, heading through the Midwest and ending at USC.
The large white tent located in McCarthy Quad housed a dozen or so professional makeup studios with mirrors and lighting usually reserved for fashion magazines. Throughout the course of the two days, dozens of students waited eagerly in line —  some fitting in time between classes — just to participate in the event.
“I’m excited for makeovers [and] to get new ideas,” said Jackie DeJesse, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences.
Although the line outside the tent did not usually grow to more than 20 students, wait times varied between 10 to 30 minutes.
Students waiting in line were given pamphlets on makeup tips according to their specific skin tone. One side of each skin tone pamphlet had a “day” look and a “night” look that focused on emphasizing one’s eyes, lips and cheeks.
Girls were also provided with a small supplement to Teen Vogue magazine that discussed behind-the-scenes hair and makeup secrets.
“I don’t know how to put on makeup, so I was wondering how it was done professionally,” said Anh Phan, a freshman majoring in cinema-television production.
Students got a taste of professional makeup once they were inside the tent. Each participant was seated in one of the cubicles in front of a mirror, where a makeup artist went to work. Pop music blasted throughout the tent, adding to the frenzy of the fast-paced makeup artists.
After hair and makeup, participants took part in their very own photo shoot — similar to what models and celebrities experience when posing for the covers of popular magazines such as Teen Vogue.
The photo shoots were not simply a gimmick, but rather another service for the students — one that lasted longer than the makeup.
“They e-mail [your pictures] to you, so you get to see the results,” DeJesse said.
On Monday, in addition to the eight hours of free makeovers, Clinique hosted a career panel discussion that featured Eva Chen, the beauty and health director of Teen Vogue. Chen and other experts offered advice to career and fashion-oriented students on campus.
In addition to the complimentary makeovers, the Clinique workers were also offered students a chance to help their careers through a contest the company was holding.
One grand prize winner will receive a paid internship working for Clinique in New York City. The winner also gets to experience the behind the scenes on Teen Vogue for an entire week. In addition to receiving a look into the fashion industry, the winners will also have the opportunity to apply to become the new “fresh face” of Clinique.
Although the main incentive is a chance to work in a major fashion publication, there is an added perk to the contest:  five finalists get to tour Clinique’s headquarters and pose for a feature spread in Teen Vogue.
Ending in Los Angeles, the tour has given students a fresh look to welcome in the fall season. And for USC students, the small event was a nice break from the chaos of school work and projects.

Following the success of The Hangover, director/screenwriter Todd Phillips thought he would have no trouble pushing out another shenanigan-packed comedy, with Due Date.
But where The Hangover succeeded with likable characters, a fluid plot and absolute hilarity, Due Date failed.
Due Date is essentially scraped together from whatever was leftover from The Hangover, and thus the final product came out stale. The main characters don’t have much of a life of their own, as they are basically unoriginal copies from The Hangover.
Road trip · Due Date follows Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) as he attempts to make it to the hospital for the birth of his child, only to be waylayed by Ethan (Zack Galifianakis). - Photos courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures 
The plot is also limp and full of unconnected, preposterous situations that neither prompt character growth nor add significance.
The film has a promising setup, but it is too disjointed, not funny enough and ultimately fails to deliver a solid and satisfying story.
The movie starts off with Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.), a short-tempered architect who is flying back to Los Angeles where his wife will soon give birth to their first child. It’s at the airport where Peter meets eccentric aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay (Zack Galifianakis).
Through a luggage mix-up and a misunderstanding over using a cell phone aboard the plane (both of which can be pinned on Ethan), Peter loses his wallet and ends up on the no-fly list. He has no money, no mode of transportation, and his only hope of getting home in time for the birth of his child is Ethan, the man who got him into this predicament in the first place. This leads the two unlikable protagonists through an unnecessary cross-country romp.
Before the two protagonists even begin making their way though trial after trial of absurdity, the movie’s formula is clear. The unmoved, dry-humored and somewhat insensitive lead is, by unchangeable circumstances, paired with the annoying, bizarre but lovable lug.
Although the lead might detest his companion at first, eventually they overcome their differences and begin a budding bromance — pretty standard.
However, Due Date completely forgets to add in the character development and likability necessary for the formula to work. There is nothing very nice about Peter. He has a dangerously short fuse — best shown in one scene where he essentially slugs a bothersome child in the stomach.
Peter is nothing compared to his travel buddy. Ethan is unnecessarily quirky, irritably childlike, rude, irresponsible, morally ambiguous, completely out of touch with social conduct and downright disgusting. He is The Hangover’s Alan Garner with all of the gross awkwardness and absolutely none of the charm.
Also, like The Hangover, nearly all of the predicaments Peter and Ethan run into are the outcast character’s fault. Peter suffers as a result of Ethan’s flaws and stupidity and ends up going through one painful ordeal after another — some of the highlights include being beaten by a man in a wheelchair and being shot in the leg.
Although Peter is not by any means a sympathetic character, audience members will most likely root for him because not rooting for him means rooting for Ethan. In fact, many moviegoers might spend most of the movie hoping that Peter will finally put his foot down concerning Ethan’s tiring and unforgivable antics and either pummel him into the ground or leave him stranded.
Or both.
Clearly a movie hasn’t been executed correctly when one protagonist determinedly strangling the other with his ridiculous scarf brings catharsis to the audience.
Eventually, the two leads begin their budding friendship, despite never reaching a sufficient turning point that changes their characters for the better. It’s as if the writers got tired of coming up with outlandish situations to put the characters through and simply had Peter accept Ethan, with no consequences for Ethan’s past actions, in order to get to the end of the film.
It feels forced and completely fabricated — think of Anakin Skywalker switching to the Dark Side in Revenge of the Sith.
By the end of the movie, Peter might be the slightest bit nicer, and Ethan does get his own reward, one that comes completely out of nowhere and shows no sign of growth from the character. It’s such an abrupt and sudden ending that it is ultimately unsatisfying.
The plot was unbelievable and it seemed as though every character other than the two main protagonists were simply making a cameo.
Although Due Date has just enough laughs to keep the audience members in their seats until the end, it certainly isn’t another Hangover, proving that a recycled storyboard alone is not sufficient for a successful film.
Your article has a pretty weak argument.  You’d be better off pointing out the decades of successful comedic pairings in movies instead of constantly going back to the Hangover.

On Monday, actor and director Diego Luna paid a visit to USC to share his views on the impact of the cinema industry.
He sat down with Annenberg professor Josh Kun in Bovard Auditorium and discussed his film career, Mexico and living the American Dream.
Luna, famous for his roles in the Mexican cult classic Y Tu Mamá También, as well as American films such as Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights and the Academy Award-winning Milk, appeared onstage amid purple, orange and yellow lights to an eruption of applause from the audience.

The Spectrum event was part of the USC Annenberg Distinguished Lecture Series on Latin American Arts and Culture in association with the USC Mexican American Alumni Association.
Kun and Luna engaged in an intimate conversation for more than an hour and a half, concentrating on Luna’s film work and the meaning behind his roles.
“How film can affect you is amazing,” Luna said. “The journey is what you keep and what makes you grow.”
A trailer from Luna’s movie Abel — his second outing as a director after helming 2007’s documentary J. C. Chavez — was shown near the beginning of the event and was greeted with enthusiastic whistles, laughs and applause.
The film centers around a young boy with the titular name who is forced to fill his absent father’s shoes as the man of the house, and mixes family drama with an undertone of the paranormal.
Kun questioned Luna on the overarching themes of the film — specifically, what the film says about the transition between childhood and adulthood.
“[Abel] starts to behave like a grown-up,” Luna said, explaining the driving focus of the film.
Luna addressed the contemporary problems of children trying to grow up too fast and admitted that he had failed to abide by this advice as a child. Luna said he wants to make sure that his own children can enjoy their childhood and not take on adult roles too young.
Luna elaborated on his belief that all children deserve two parents and discussed the difficulties that single parents face. The film reflects his beliefs, Luna said, as Abel’s mother struggles to raise her children by herself after her husband leaves.
“[Parenthood is] a responsibility that’s meant to be shared,” Luna said. “I believe a kid needs a father every day. That’s the way it should be … In Mexico, you have all these broken families where fathers leave for the United States.”
Aside from the movie, Kun and Luna spent a large portion of their time talking about acting as a career.
“Everything I’ve done in my life … got me here,” Luna said. “Acting is about curiosity, knowing who you are.”
The majority of Luna’s hardships, he said,  stem from his childhood in Mexico. Growing up, his father repeatedly begged him to become anything but an actor, but Luna persisted with his dream despite the objections. Luna looks back at his start as an actor with a calmer outlook tempered by his efforts to break into Hollywood.
Luna also said he believes political tensions and economic disparity hinder social progress in Mexico. This issue of the general welfare of Mexican citizens is immensely important to Luna, and he is trying to make sure the film industry does its part.
“There’s a lot of talent in Mexico, but there’s no infrastructure for that talent to explode. I believe cinema can help,” Luna said.
Luna delved deeper into specific social issues, stressing that unity is key for Mexico’s growth. He brought up an earthquake that struck Mexico in 1985, saying it helped unify the people of Mexico in a time of great need.
“I believe the earthquake was kind of a shake for our generation,” he said. “There was a feeling of connection … a generation that is connected and knows it’s a part of something bigger.”
Returning to Luna’s acting career, Kun asked about his breakout starring role in the 2001 film Y Tu Mamá También and the difficulties in playing a character struggling with his sexual identity.
“It’s all about understanding [and] allowing someone to be different,” Luna said.
Luna’s character in Milk, Jack Lira, also faced societal challenges concerning his homosexuality and ethnic status as a Mexican-American in the 1970s.
During the discussion, a clip from the 2007 movie Mister Lonely played, in which Luna portrayed a Michael Jackson look-alike entertainer who meets Marilyn Monroe at a retirement center.
Afterward, Kun ended the onstage interview, opening the floor up for questions from students. Although the topics ranged — and many of the questions were extremely specific to certain parts of Luna’s career — one overarching trend emerged: Students wanted to know Luna’s views on events in Mexico. One student asked for Luna’s views on Mexico’s political and social progress.
“I’m happy because there’s hope,” Luna said.
Throughout his conversation with Kun and other students, it became clear that the actor is genuinely optimistic for the future of Mexican and American cinema and the eventual interconnection between the two. He disregarded the idea of national cinema, instead supporting cinema as a borderless industry.
“Films shouldn’t have a passport,” Luna said. “We should just talk about film, period.”

Want to BBM but don’t actually have a BlackBerry? A new BlackBerry application brings BlackBerry Messenger features to any smartphone.
Kik Messenger is a free smartphone chat application that can be used on any BlackBerry, iPhone, iPod or Android. It allows users to have instant conversations with other Kik users — letting you know when your text message has been send, delivered, read or even when the other person is responding.
Although the Blackberry Messenger Application only offers free “instant message” texting to other Blackberry users, Kik Messenger doesn’t discriminate, making the essence of BBM available to more smartphone users.
Kik also offers Push messages, cross-border messaging, landscape typing, offline messages, and more, according to the Blackberry App World website.

USC is not exactly renowned for being a “green” school.
College of the 21st century though we might be, our efforts in sustainability  leave a lot to be desired, especially when compared to such eco-friendly universities as CU Boulder or even UCLA.
The USC administration is slowly trying to steer its massive facilities in an environmentally conscious direction, and one of the greatest difficulties in this is just how multi-faceted “greening” an entire campus really is.
Alice Li | Daily Trojan
To try to manage this, USC created the Office of Sustainability, which has resolved for 2010 to include minimizing environmental impact, maximizing the purchase of electricity from renewable resources, conserving water, recycling, organizing “green” incentive programs and designing buildings that meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards.
Of the 360-plus buildings that are considered USC property, both on campus and in the surrounding areas, only one has been LEED certified — the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. It is certainly a step in the right direction, as LEED-certified buildings save up to 30-40 percent more energy than non-LEED buildings.
Unfortunately, the only other buildings on campus queued up for this certification are the School of Cinematic Arts and the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research. Such vigorous planning and reconstruction efforts should be made where it matters most — student housing.
An application on the  Office of Sustainability’s website called Dashboard allows users to view daily energy consumption in certain buildings on campus, including student housing.
Energy consumption in suite-style housing such as Parkside International and Arts & Humanities residential colleges and Fluor Tower is especially high. Not surprisingly, no building at USC is Energy Star labeled, according to USC’s 2010 Sustainability Report Card.
As for converting to renewable resources, efforts are sluggish at best. The report card gave USC a D in the Climate Change & Energy category, Ds in Green Building and Shareholder Engagement and an F in Endowment Transparency, noting that USC has yet to complete a long-overdue greenhouse gas emissions inventory for 2010, has yet to make feasible efforts toward utilizing renewable resources and going coal-free and has yet to retrofit the lighting on campus.
Water conservation is one aspect that has somewhat improved. In recent years USC has purchased renewable energy through its long-standing and somewhat exclusive contract with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power; in 2006, 7 percent of energy consumed by the university came from Los Angeles City Eligible Renewable Resources.
During the past three years, Facilities Management Services has introduced a central irrigation system on campus wherein approximately 80 percent of grass is currently serviced by the Calsense Central Irrigation Control System.
This system helps offset irrigation by sensing wind levels, gauging rainfall and monitoring water flow in pipes. The 3-million gallon water storage tank beneath Cromwell Field also saves USC about 4,500 megawatts of electricity a year, and as of 2010 USC is looking to expand its chilled water thermal energy circulation — it’s currently serviced by the pump house in the basement of Grace Ford Salvatori Hall.
As a school of with an endowment of $2.4 billion (as of March 2009), USC can surely afford to divest more efforts into addressing all aspects of “greening” our school. Something as simple as putting compost bins in dormitories and dining areas can potentially reduce our waste by the ton.
Encouraging alternative transportation for students can help individuals contribute, be it by offering student discounts on bus/metro passes or making USC more bike-friendly by adding bike racks rather than taking them away.
There’s no need to wait for Earth Day to worry about the environment. USC has both the funds and the management necessary to implement projects both big and small that can transform our campus.

After the midterm elections last week, a common refrain has been how difficult it will be to pass any legislation in Washington.
The gridlock that is expected from a Congress dominated by staunch opposition to many of the president’s core positions threatens to make decisive action impossible, essentially ruling out the federal government’s ability to deal with any number of pressing issues for at least two years.
Two issues in which there might be an opportunity for significant progress, however, are long-term investments in the United States’ future that have been neglected for too long: restoring our systems of education and infrastructure to world-class levels.
Although Democrats and Republicans have their fundamental disagreements about the role of government, the moderates of each side concur that it is the government’s responsibility to ensure the provision of key public goods — those that do not provide enough benefit to any single private entity to justify that an individual or group take on their cost, but whose benefit to society is so high that they are worth spending our collective resources  (the national budget) to maintain.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
Education and infrastructure fall squarely in this category, as a deficit in either threatens the future of our economy as well as our national security. A poorly educated population cannot compete in an increasingly globalized and information-centered economy — neither can a population that spends all day stuck in traffic.
Unfortunately, right now the United States is moving in the wrong direction in both areas.
In education, Americans today are less likely to graduate from high school than their parents and less likely to have strong math and science skills than their peers in competitor markets such as France.
On the most recent Program for International Student Assessment test, given by the U.S. Department of Education, American 15-year-olds finished only 16th out of 30 nations in science, and 23rd in math.
These tragic results come despite the fact that we currently spend more per pupil — more than $10,000 in constant 2006-2007 dollars — than at any time in our history. This is almost double what we spent 30 years ago.
This means that what we need is not more spending, but a major reform of the education system.
However, this issue has received precious little attention in Washington since the Bush Administration’s No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.
The national infrastructure is in a similarly woeful predicament, albeit one whose solution lies likely in increased spending rather than institutional reform.
The American Society of Civil Engineers’ 2009 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure awarded our bridges a C, dams and transit systems Ds, and roads, levees and drinking water systems D-minuses.
Though this group might be slightly overdramatic — our infrastructure remains far superior to what most of the world’s population deals with on a daily basis — it is true that our infrastructure is aging and that we are being surpassed by key competitors such as China that spend aggressively to modernize their systems.
The United States has not undertaken a major national infrastructure construction program since the Eisenhower administration. This has resulted in disasters ranging from broken levees in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina to a 2007 bridge collapse in Minnesota that killed 13 people.
Decaying infrastructure also incurs more routine costs. The average household spends more on transportation than on food, traffic costs an estimated $80 billion a year and flight delays cost approximately $10 billion each year.
Just as with our schools, government is not doing enough to address this problem. We invest less than one-third of what Western Europe does on infrastructure as a percentage of GDP, and our lack of new infrastructure initiatives contrasts sharply with projects in countries we consider up-and-coming rivals, such as new highways in China or a high-speed rail in Brazil.
Redirecting some of our spending to infrastructure, which is both an essential investment for the future and a job-creation machine in the present, will be necessary if we wish to remain competitive economically.
These types of initiatives would be encouraging to see during the lame-duck session.
Not only are they feasible in the current political situation and important investments in the future, but also because their success would contribute to a constructive, bipartisan environment in Washington that has been conspicuously absent for quite some time.
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” runs Wednesdays.
Gridlock will be GREAT if it keeps Congress from spending more money, actually.
As for education, Daniel is certainly on target that it needs reform, but clearly the federal government has done nothing to improve it, and should be dismissed from class on this one. Return schools to local/state control, where teachers (and teacher UNIONS) can be held accountable.
Right. Public education needs to be reformed, the unions need to be de-fanged, but the federal government must NOT be allowed to meddle further in it. Dismantling the department of education (or at least, de-funding it) would be a good start. I wonder if Daniel and his Democrats would agree to this plan and make it bi-partisan?
The current Congress has neglected its duty. They did not  oversee the current slate of agencies, but instead focused on creating new ones. Congress is in charge of the budget of the Leviathan that is the federal government. They need to stop growing it and take care to see that it does no harm.

Redshirt freshman backup defensive end James Boyd announced yesterday that he plans to walk on to the USC men’s basketball team, and could be practicing with the team as early as this week.
Boyd, a 6-foot-4 245-pound redshirt freshman, said that he’s just waiting for the green light from football coach Lane Kiffin before practicing with the basketball team, but that he will definitely be spending more time with the basketball team once the Trojans’ season ends Dec. 4 against crosstown rival UCLA.
Boyd attended L.A. Jordan High School and played four different sports, excelling in football and basketball.  As a senior, Boyd averaged 23.8 points and 22.4 rebounds per game, enough to get him named to the All-L.A. City team.
The young defensive lineman claims that he would have tried to walk on to the basketball team last year had he not torn cartilage in his left knee, which forced him to redshirt as a freshman last year in the first place.
If Boyd manages to make the Trojan hoop squad this year, he would bring some much-needed strength and depth to USC’s thin front line.
Boyd, who is currently suspended from the football team for academic issues, is ready to take his skills to the hardwood and believes he can be a serious asset to the team.
“I know my role,” he said.  “I know what I can do.”

University of California President Mark Yudof has proposed an 8 percent increase in student tuition fees for the next year.
Yudof said the increase comes as an attempt to close the budget deficits in the statewide public university.
“The economy remains stalled and state funding lags behind our needs by at least $1 billion. The reality is that much more must be done if the university is to keep its promise to California,” he said in an open letter to university students.
Families making less than $120,000 will not have to pay the fee increase for the next year.
His proposed plan will also increase financial aid assistance to families that make less that $80,000.

With the reduction of scholarships because of NCAA sanctions impending, the Trojans are  looking to maintain an edge on the football field by upgrading the special teams unit.
When Lane Kiffin lured special teams coach John Baxter away from Fresno State after 13 years of coaching, it marked USC’s newfound emphasis on a portion of the game that Pete Carroll’s staff often relegated to walk-ons and transfers.
With seniors Joe Houston and Jacob Harfman — who handle field goals and punts respectively — graduating in the spring it was important for the Trojans to look to improve their special teams unit. Houston is 6 for 12 on field goal attempts and Harfman is averaging 42.5 yards per punt.
Kiffin has addressed this issue by snaring commitments from top-ranked kicker Andre Heidari, highly-rated punter Kris Albarado and long-snapper Peter McBride.  Heidari, who is rated as the top kicker in the nation by both ESPN and Rivals, is handling kickoffs for Stockdale High in Bakersfield while Albarado is averaging 47.6 yards per punt in Lake Charles, LA.
All three recruits look to make an immediate impact as freshmen.

The 2016 Super Bowl could be played right here in Los Angeles as a result of the city’s plan to build an NFL stadium next to the Staples Center that would open in time for the 2015 football season.
Though the NFL has requirements that a venue be operating for at least a year before being eligible to host the Super Bowl, AEG has asked that an exception be made because the first-ever Super Bowl took place at the L.A. Coliseum and the 2016 Bowl would mark its 50th Anniversary.
That particular arena would hold a dual purpose: Sports venue and convention space.
The plan for the stadium include potentially hosting the 2020 World Cup, the NCAA Final Four, and even has hopes of bringing an NFL team back to Los Angeles.
Though nothing has been finalized the $1-billion stadium could be completed by 2015, AEG president Tim Leiweke told the Los Angeles Times.
“We’re asking [the NFL] to look at our track record, the uniqueness of that anniversary, and the place that this city played in hosting Super Bowls,” Leiweke said.

The first six students to take part in the Gould School of Law’s new international human rights clinic were announced last week.
Professor Hannah Garry will lead the clinic, the first of its kind at USC, to guide the students as they work with judges and legal officers on human rights prosecutions in Rwanda and Cambodia.
Garry, who worked previously at the University of Colorado School of Law with students on cases involving Guantanamo prisoners, said the clinic will give students hands-on experience in law.
“[The purpose is] to give students the opportunity to work on real-life cases and projects that teach them how to be human rights advocates … and international lawyers,” Garry said.

Joining her are third-year law students Trevar Kolodny, Jamie Hoffman, Aysha Pamukcu, Shannon Raj, Brian Rifkin and Seepan Parseghian.
“I’ve been hoping USC would have a program like this for a long time,” Raj said.
The first semester, the clinic will accept only six law students who will work in the spring. In subsequent terms, it will accept eight students who will be expected to commit to a year of work in the clinic.
In the first semester, students will be working long-distance with judges and legal officers from the Rwanda tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania.
“They will be working remotely with a lot of these organizations overseas that we’re partners with and using all of the technological tools that we have in our day to be able to cross the borders — like Skype, conference calls, video conferencing,” Garry said.
The melding of international law with human rights advocacy was a key factor in attracting students.
“I felt like my classes were very interesting, but they didn’t always speak to each other,” Pamukcu said. “That interdisciplinary aspect that I was really hungry for had finally presented itself in the form of the clinic.”
Pamukcu’s interest in human rights law was born in high school, as a reporter. Writing about issues such as teen relationship abuse, she said she felt a desire to go beyond just writing about them.
“I realized I was getting frustrated just reading about it and that I wanted to actually be involved and helping out,” she said.
Parseghian said he was exposed to the horrific effects of human rights abuses from a very young age. His grandparents from both sides were survivors of widespread killings in Armenia and eventually settled in Iraq, where his parents were born.
“I was very familiar at a very early age about what the greatest forms of human rights abuses could be and what human beings are very capable of doing to one another,” Parseghian said.
Though the clinic is open only to law students — with priority being given to second- and third-year students — Garry sees the clinic assuming a broader role on campus.
“I do perceive the clinic … providing a focal point for a real innovative kind of thinking about human rights problems of our day and how to come up with good solutions for tackling them,” she said.
Garry said she hopes the clinic will allow students to work on cases and projects concerning persecution, torture, human trafficking, genocide and other crimes against humanity.
Part of the challenge, Garry said, is picking and choosing which cases to work on.
“I have been networking with partner organizations overseas and also here in L.A.,” she said. “I really want for the clinic to focus on local human rights issues as well. There’s just so much to get involved with.”
Garry said she hopes that the program will eventually evolve to allow students to travel abroad to places such as Arusha and work hand-in-hand with judges in the second semester of their service at the clinic.
“What I’m working on developing right now is a kind of partner support fund that would allow our students and myself to go onsite as partners, to go overseas after working long-distance remotely,” she said.

A new study comparing public policies relating to 10 high-profile political issues with general public opinion was released last month by the vice dean of the USC Marshall School of Business.
John Matsusaka examined the congruence between the views of the public regarding highly controversial matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion and capital punishment, and the policy choices that are currently being enforced by state governments.
The study found that only 59 percent of the policy choices were representative of the general public’s majority views.
“If policies were selected by flipping a coin, you would get 50 percent congruence. So my finding is that congruence was only 9 percent better than random policy making,” Matsusaka wrote in an e-mail. “I found this surprising and certainly much lower than I expected.”
Nicole Cruz, a junior majoring in psychology, said this particular study emphasizes the belief many hold that their vote ultimately will not make a difference when it comes to specific policy issues.
“As a young voter, these statistics worry me. It upsets me that my vote doesn’t seem to matter, especially with such important and pressing issues during this day and age,” Cruz said.
Matsusaka also found, however, that states which allow citizens to propose and approve laws directly through initiatives are much more congruent with public opinion, such as in California.
“It is clear that ballot propositions help the majority rule. This evidence contradicts those who argue that the initiative process is actually controlled by special interests,” Matsusaka wrote.
Matsusaka collected data for about three years for the study, which was published in the most recent issue of Quarterly Journal of Political Science.
He said that he has been thinking about the underlying issues of the study for at least 10 years.
“I was and am interested in this because, like many people, I have the feeling that our elected representatives often do not represent ‘the people,’ but rather cater to special interests,” Matsusaka said. “I wanted to gather some evidence that would indicate if this feeling was true. And more important, if it was true, I wanted to understand what sort of political reforms might make things better.”
Dayna Walker, a senior majoring in economics, said she was not surprised by the results of Matsusaka’s study.
“Since we have a representative democracy rather than a direct democracy, I’m not that shocked by these results. Of course I would like to see more alignment between public policy and public opinion, but in time I am hopeful that they will become more congruent,” Walker said.
Although Matsusaka said he is unsure of what kind of impact this study might have on the future of politics, he remains optimistic that it will help policymakers in the future.
“I hope that this [study], together with other studies, will paint a better picture of modern American democracy so we can think intelligently about how to modernize it and make it work better for us,” Matsusaka said.
