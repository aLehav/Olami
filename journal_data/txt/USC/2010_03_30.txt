On March 18, after 25 years in prison for crimes she says she did not commit, Rosie Sanchez walked free for a moment. But as soon as she walked out of the prison doors, she walked immediately into a United States Immigration and Customs vehicle that drove her to the Mexican border.

“To have it happen that quickly is just unheard of,” said Jennifer Farrell, a second-year law student at the USC Gould School of Law who has been working on Sanchez’s case as part of the Post-Conviction Justice Project. “That’s why it was such a shock that she was deported the day she was released from prison.”
On Dec. 8, 1985, Sanchez, who was then a shop owner in the garment district, was arrested for murder when a rival shop burned down, killing a man who was sleeping inside. Sanchez has insisted she was innocent since the day of her arrest.
Sanchez’s case was brought to the attention of the Post-Conviction Justice Program last year, and Farrell spent several months fighting to prove Sanchez’s innocence. She was eventually pardoned by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on March 18.
After receiving her pardon, Sanchez was released March 18. But because authorities said she was never a legal citizen, she was immediately deported.
In the late 1970s, Sanchez applied to an amnesty program, according to Farrell. She completed an application, submitted it to the Department of Motor Vehicles and received a license. Sanchez paid taxes and possessed a business license for her store in Downtown Los Angeles.
“She thought she was here legally,” Farrell said.
In 1991, after her conviction, Sanchez applied to transfer to a prison in Mexico, but received a letter stating that because Sanchez was a legal citizen in the United States, she could not transfer to a prison in Mexico.
In October, when Farrell represented Sanchez at her parole hearing, she presented parole plans that Sanchez would voluntarily deport and live with her sister in Mexicali, Mexico.
“Part of the reason we did that is because that would be a better legal argument for when the board considered her for parole,” Farrell said.
She added that because Sanchez was innocent and not a danger to society, they did not expect Sanchez to be deported.
“Everyone had gotten their hopes up that it was going to work out,” Farrell said.
In March, when Sanchez’s parole was upheld by the governor, the prison said Sanchez could temporarily stay with her daughter in Los Angeles after her release the following week.
Initially Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Sanchez would be detained in Los Angeles for two weeks and then face an immigration committee that would re-evaluate her case.
But a few days before Sanchez’s release, ICE called and said she would be deported immediately.
“ICE says she’s always been illegal and has been here illegally,” Farrell said.
Farrell is now working with Sanchez to help her return to the United States.
“We’re trying everything we can,” Farrell said. “I will be on the case through the end of the semester, but the clinic will definitely stay with the case as long as there’s something we can do for it,” Farrell said.
Farrell is talking to immigration lawyers at the law school and looking into Sanchez’s legal status as a citizen of the United States. ICE has not yet returned any phone calls, Farrell said.
Ultimately, Sanchez would like to come back to Los Angeles and spend time with her four children, who have all settled in the area.
“She wants to be able to live with her kids,” Farrell said. “Right now, she’s completely banned from the United States … We really don’t think it’s fair what happened.”
Sanchez is currently celebrating her release with friends and family in her hometown of Mexicali. Sanchez and her children were not available for comment.
“She’s happy to be there, [but] it could be better,” Farrell said. “It’s still overall a victory, but with an asterisk.”
So… the student, Farrell, orchestrated the deal to accept deportation in exchange for parole… and now we’re supposed to be angry at the government (not the righteous Farrell!) because the state basically accepted the deal? Thanks to a USC student, another convicted murderer is free, and another illegal immigrant is no longer our problem. Congratulations or something!
You’d think after robbing an innocent woman of 25 years of her life, we could have given her a break on immigration. Just reprehensible…
Cheers to Farrell for using her education to give back!

Sometimes, the perfect dress sits just outside of your budget. The color, the style, the cut — it’s everything you have been searching for, but the price is not justified by the one night you will actually wear it. With a new websites, however, you can wear this dream dress at a reasonable cost.
How to · Because of her company’s relatively new concept, The Stylist LA owner Emily McDonald brings a “How it Works” sign to trunk shows. - Photos courtesy of Emily McDonald 
Websites such as RentTheRunway.com and WearTodayGoneTomorrow.com began the dress-rental craze last year by offering the glamour of designer dresses at a fraction of the cost. After the customer browses a virtual closet and chooses a dress, the websites mail the purchase. The customer then wears the dress and mails it back within the allotted time.
While these companies are both New York-based, USC alumna Emily McDonald — who graduated in 2007 — has founded her own high-end dress rental company a little closer to home, The Stylist LA.
From Karina Gramaldi’s bright and memorable wearables to the Alice + Olivia, LaROK and Twelfth Street by Cynthia Vincent dresses women crave, customers can sort through The Stylist LA’s growing collection and find the right outfit for any event.
“I try to choose dresses that people would only wear once if they owned it,” McDonald said.
Though many customers are drawn to the service by its unique selection of designer gowns, McDonald’s greatest selling point is personalized service.
“Borrowing off the Internet is iffy,” she said of dress rental companies solely based online. “With other sites, you could order a dress that doesn’t fit right, but I come to you and make sure you get the best fitting dress.”
For as little as $30, McDonald will play the role of personal stylist, using her fashion knowledge to help her customers find the best look for whatever occasion. She has an eye for matching body types with the most flattering dresses and brings a car full of options to every session.
Being a personal shopper for each of her customers might sound like a lot for one woman, but styling is hardly work for McDonald, who says she has fun everyday.
“My goal is to be the Rachel Zoe for ordinary people,” McDonald said. “I would drive across Los Angeles at 9 p.m. on a Friday night if someone needed a dress last minute.”
McDonald refined her business as a student in the Marshall School of Business where she wrote the company’s first plans for an entrepreneurship class her senior year. But before she enacted her business proposal, she did some background research, spending a year at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising studying product development and working briefly for Yael Aflalo, a leading L.A. designer. It was while she aided Aflalo during the closing of her label that McDonald decided to rewrite her business plan.
Believing in her dream and passion, family friends invested in McDonald’s company, and despite the recession’s negative effects on other facets of the fashioin industry, her website is still growing.
McDonald kicked off The Stylist LA’s first season last August with a trunk show at the Radisson Hotel adjacent to campus. She invited incoming female USC students, many of whom ended up renting dresses for sorority recruitment events.
With the success of marketing to USC’s female population, McDonald plans to expand her showings to other local colleges, including UCLA, Loyola Marymount and Cal State Long Beach. Eventually, her goal is to expand the business to high school proms and formals.
Though she sees a potential market from students, however, McDonald said post-college women in their mid-twenties could also benefit from the service. Parties and social events often fill the agendas of today’s young female urbanites, and the need for a different dress for each one has become increasingly crucial to maintain one’s image. This seemingly frivolous need can leave holes in budgets if one isn’t careful, but utilizing a dress-rental service can provide the image one wants with a price one can afford.
McDonald said she is excited to see her dream becoming reality. Though she currently only serves customers in Southern California, she hopes to one day expand to more areas — but only if she can find people to help her maintain the company’s strict customer service standards.
“I am going to take it slow for now,” McDonald said. “I don’t want to outgrow my own reach.”
I have used The Stylist LA to rent dresses on two occasions. Emily helped me pick great dresses that everyone complimented. I love this company and would recommend it to anyone!

Several items have gone missing from the Ronald Tutor Campus Center construction site, but authorities disagree as to whether the items were stolen or simply misplaced.
According to Department of Public Safety reports, a total of 16 screw guns, each valued at approximately $300 to $400, and a hammer drill battery went missing in the three-month period between November and February.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said DPS does not believe there is any foul play involved.
The tools, Carlisle said, are more likely missing because of a poor system in place by the construction company in charge of the site, which doesn’t have a regular system in place for checking on their materials.
“At first glance, it doesn’t seem someone is coming in during the middle of the night to steal these things,” Carlisle said. “A number of power tools are checked out by workers, but they don’t check on the equipment again for a number of months.”
But Stan Westfall of USC Capital Construction said he thinks there might be a bigger problem at hand.
“It could have been misplaced, but last I heard, it wasn’t,” Westfall said.
He wouldn’t give details of worker checkout policies, however, for fear of creating further theft issues in the future.
“If there is a theft problem, I don’t want people finding out how to get around it,” Westfall said.
He noted that steps have been taken to prevent thefts,
“We’ve been locking the fences around the project. We can also now lock the building’s doors and that definitely helps,” Westfall said.
Carlisle added that he thinks the report was most likely filed for insurance purposes.
“We cannot confirm that a theft has occurred,” he said. “It could be misplaced. We really don’t know.”
DPS will file a lost property report and then turn the case over to the Los Angeles Police Department.

You’ve probably seen them at Ralphs: those cool cats who slink up to the register and don’t bat an eye when their bill costs three times as much as it should. And when they slide past, they give you a superior smirk — you and your bag of conventional oranges.
Like Scottish accents, everything’s sexier when it’s organic. There is organic produce, meat, cereal, ice cream, chips and even soda. Stores have entire aisles devoted to the stuff. Whole Foods Market, despite legal battles, a recession and the nickname “Whole Paycheck,” still wrangled $49.7 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter. People clearly want their pot pie, and they want it free range and pesticide-free.
The obvious exceptions are poor college kids like us who can’t afford $3 cucumbers and $15 chicken breasts and skeptical folk who wonder if the government really is trying to kill us.
Is organic food truly superior? Just like an episode of Lost, the answer isn’t cut and dried. But there are facts that can at least help you make an informed choice if you’re considering taking a walk down the natural foods aisle.
Most organic arguments center on fruits and veggies. To some, conventional produce is awash in pesticides. To others, a rutabaga is a rutabaga. Since 2002, the United States Department of Agriculture has had strict standards in place for food to garner an organic label — basically, no synthetic pesticides or fertilizers.
A 2005 study from UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine tracked down several previous studies comparing organic and conventional produce. Many of the studies, some dating back as far as 1997, show that organic vegetables had higher levels of vitamin C, higher quality protein and lower levels of nitrites. This would be a point for organics. What these studies did not consider, however, were plant genetics, location and the handling and storage of the produce, all of which contribute to nutritional value. Conventional growing techniques do put less stress on crops than organic ones, however, and some speculate these stresses can alter a plant’s biological composition.
Meanwhile, a 2002 study published in Food Additives and Contaminants concluded that conventional veggies are more likely to have traces of pesticides on them than organic ones. At the same time, natural pesticides and fertilizers have a far greater risk of being contaminated with food-borne bacteria. A similar study concluded that organic vegetables are more likely to carry E. coli, and organic spinach was the cause of an American
E. coli outbreak in 2006. Nevertheless, USDA-certified organic farms are much less likely to be contaminated than produce from self-proclaimed organic farms.
One of the latest publications on the organics debate, a 2009 review published by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, took into account an even longer time frame, 1958 to 2008, for studies comparing organic to conventional produce. The conclusion was that there are currently no clear benefits to consuming organic produce, but that even with the best research it is difficult to accurately compare organic and conventional food because there are many factors, including crop yields, produce management techniques and unreliably small studies.
Often, the organic argument relies on a specific crutch — natural fallacy. There is the assumption that natural fertilizers and pesticides must be better for you than something cooked up in a laboratory. The truth is that Mother Earth is not always kind. Would you drink arsenic-spiked water?
Most organic pesticides contain rotenone, which chicken farmers use to destroy parasitic mites. Though in pesticides the rotenone levels are deemed safe for humans, it goes to show that natural does not always equal good for you. Meanwhile, organic and synthetic fertilizers are both based in phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium. It is only the source that is different.
USC Keck School of Medicine professor Joseph Landolph points out that some plants, such as mushrooms, are toxic even without human meddling. While he believes in organic produce, he acknowledges that organic growing practices have their limitations.
“I’m in favor of it,” Landolph said. “But I don’t know how practical it is to feed the whole world with it … I would like to see us move away from pesticides if we could, but it’s not practical yet.”
Landolph believes pesticide use should be tightly regulated, both the synthetic and organic varieties. He himself likes to shop at farmers markets with his wife, but often they just buy what’s available at the supermarket.
Ultimately, according to Dr. Roger Clemens, a USC professor in the School of Pharmacy, organic and conventional produce fall under the same authority.
“The safety of fruits and vegetables is under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture,” Clemens said. “The safety standards of these foods are the same whether they are produced using conventional agricultural practices or following the national standards on organic production and handling.”
Just because science has dabbled in your food does not render it something to be loathed. Take, for example, the green revolution, where the International Rice Research Institute, founded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, developed a designer breed of rice, IR8. It increased rice yield by a factor of five, saved countless millions from starvation and made India and the Philippines major rice exporters. Pesticides used with IR8 did contribute to the decline of some fish and amphibian species in the Philippines, but regardless, many people benefited from the rice. Later, the institute developed IR72, which could better resist breakage and pests, and further exploded crop yields.
And don’t forget, we’re talking about food here. Taste is a huge aspect when choosing what to stuff in your mouth. People often report that organic food tastes better. But consider where your food came from — if it’s a peach from Farmer Conker’s orchard a mile down the road, it’s going to taste better than one imported from Chile, organic or not. For the best tasting fruits and veggies, stay close to home.
And don’t think buying local or organic means you reduce your carbon footprint. Just because your food comes from the same country does not mean it saved energy. When factors such as the efficiencies of overseas farms (distant grassy sheep farms compared to feed-dependent American equivalents) and the quality of growing conditions are taken into account, you are not necessarily saving the planet by buying local.
At the same time, organic or not, when you support local agriculture, you really are helping domestic products and smaller family farms. Despite its homey image, the majority of organic produce in California comes from five farms, which earn more than $600 million a year. So you are not exactly supporting the little guy when you opt for organic blueberries.
Also, when you buy products from Kashi, Dagoba or Odwalla, you are ultimately paying their respective parent companies, Kellogg’s, Hershey and Coca-Cola. There is no reason not to buy from these companies, but do not do so under the impression you are actually aiding Grandpa Frank and Grandma Ann with their vegetable patch.
You might have also noticed shelves of organic cookies, crackers and ice cream. But don’t think you’re off the hook for moderation just because it’s organic. Sugar is still sugar, regardless of whether it’s cane sugar or evaporated cane juice.
“The most important thing for Americans is to eat a healthy, balanced diet,” Landolph said. “Too much sugar is contributing to too many carbohydrates, which leads to Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome … There’s still great nutrition in a bag of tomatoes from New Jersey.”
There is nothing wrong with buying organic. But there is no evidence to suggest that there is anything wrong with buying conventional produce either. Most Americans do not eat the recommended five servings of fruits and veggies a day anyway — just chomping on a few more pesticide-laced, fertilizer-baptized apples is a good start.
Mimi Honeycutt is a sophomore majoring in print journalism. Her column “Gingersnaps” runs Wednesdays.
good main point: “There is nothing wrong with buying organic. But there is no evidence to suggest that there is anything wrong with buying conventional produce either. “
You know who liked organic food? Hitler, that’s who.

The Undergraduate Student Government on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution that could help alleviate student confusion about double majoring or minoring in different fields of study.
With the passage of the resolution, USG will begin working with administrators to help get students interdisciplinary advisers who will help them plan a course of study that spans different academic fields.
“What we’re doing is giving [the resolution] to the administration, and they’ll see it has full support of the Senate,” said Andrew Matson, USG’s director of academic affairs.
Matson has been working on the proposal all year. He said he feels that, since USC encourages students to take on second majors or minors, the university should also provide support for those students.
“Advising hasn’t caught up with that push on students [to study different fields], so we really need to improve the situation so students can take advantage of all the interdisciplinary options at USC,” Matson said.
He said he will push for the next USG administration — specifically the new director of academic affairs — to continue working on the resolution.
Ashlie Chan, vice president of USG, said she also thinks it’s very important that the next administration keeps working on the resolution so interdisciplinary advising can become a reality.
Chan said the addition of interdisciplinary advisers will benefit students because it will lead to less confusion about their choice of studies.
“There are so many people I know by word of mouth saying they are either double majors or [majoring and minoring] … and sometimes they have no idea what counted for what major, what classes are going to give them credit for something,” Chan said. “Having interdisciplinary advisers specializing in what can count as two different requirements is going to make students’ lives so much easier.”
The new administration’s officers, who will have the chance to see this proposal to fruition if they choose, will be selected in a few weeks.

After nearly 17 years away, Paul McCartney is returning to the Hollywood Bowl. McCartney will be performing at the Hollywood Bowl on March 30 and March 31 for the first time since 1993. McCartney began his 2010 tour in Arizona on March 28 and will continue to tour throughout the year.
McCartney will be playing some of his solo hit songs as well as Beatles classics. According to The Arizona Republic, McCartney played a grand total of 21 Beatles songs Monday night in Arizona.
Paul McCartney is one of the two remaining Beatles. With fans young and old, McCartney’s show is bound to be a sellout.
If you have some spare cash and love the Beatles, why not buy a ticket to see one of the Fab Four — if only for something to brag about to your grandchildren.

After USC middle linebacker Rey Maualuga turned UCLA quarterback Patrick Cowan into a grease spot on the sideline of the 2007 rivalry matchup, Bruin and Trojan fans alike wondered if the 6-foot-2 Samoan man-killer should be institutionalized.
Honestly, three years of watching Maualuga charge into other Pac-10 stadiums, ravage and plunder offenses and set sail with his opponent’s pride was enough to make even the most bloodthirsty sports fan question the mental stability of USC’s most notorious defensive weapon.
But when Maualuga plowed his car into two parked vehicles and a parking meter on Jan. 29 with the ferocity he once used to greet meandering tailbacks, the NFL rookie was forced to seek help of a different sort.  After pleading guilty to a DUI and accepting two years probation, Maualuga checked into an alcohol rehabilitation center.
Four weeks later, the Cincinnati Bengal’s favorite convict (with apologies to Chris Henry) is back from rehab with a glint in his eye, blood on his teeth and a brand new attitude.
“All I can say is you’re looking at a different guy,” Maualuga told reporters on Monday during the Bengal’s first offseason workout.  “I got what I needed when I went in.  It was a life-changer for me.”
The second-round pick from last year’s NFL draft helped lead the Bengals to an AFC North Championship last year with 63 tackles and a sack.
This year Maualuga looks to solidify his role in the starting lineup and learn to distinguish between Patrick Cowan and stationary vehicles.
“This year is a different year, and it’s my year,” Maualuga said.  “I’m going to come out and give it everything I got.”

Much of the discussion about bicycle policies has focused on the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street, an intersection with heavy pedestrian traffic. But now USC’s Department of Public Safety is ramping up its safety efforts at the intersection of McClintock Avenue and 34th Street.
According to DPS officials, the congestion at the McClintock and 34th intersection — just south of Gate 5 — is worse than anywhere else near campus. To help remedy the situation, DPS has set up signs warning students to get off their bikes, skateboards or roller skates as they cross the road. Officers are also stationed at the intersection to make sure students follow this rule.
DPS Sgt. Leesa Sandell said many students fail to obey these rules, causing near-accidents.
“The problem is that everyone is in a hurry, so safety is not really a concern at that point for them,” she said. “People are not stopping, and you see people almost get hit.”
Sandell said DPS had hoped the signs would suffice, but it decided the situation was bad enough to warrant stationing officers by the crosswalk to ensure students get off their bikes and cross safely.
“Unless we have uniformed officers present, people will not stop on their own,” Sandell said.
Monica Gomez, a DPS officer who frequently works at the intersection, said it is important for students to help in the effort to keep the intersection safe.
“It’s our responsibility to get students from point A to point B safely, but without their cooperation it’s difficult,” Gomez said.
Gomez said she has seen a number of near-hits, and has even witnessed a staff member from the school of dentistry get hit by a bike as she was trying to cross the street on foot.
“It’s frustrating to see students almost get hit,” she said. “That intersection is not set up to handle that much volume of traffic.”
Some students, however, do not think the precautions DPS is taking are necessary.
Lauren Woods, a sophomore majoring in sociology, said she appreciates having DPS officers at the intersection but does not feel making students dismount their bikes is paramount to safety at the intersection.
“I do like that there is someone who is directing traffic,” Woods said. “I think they should make sure student on bikes stop before crossing but I don’t think they should make you get off.”
Allison Griffin, a sophomore majoring in psychology, said she’s not sure why there is so much focus on the intersection since she has not noticed much congestion.
“It’s really unnecessary since there is no heavy through traffic on 34th Street,” Griffin said.
Others, however, said they don’t mind the rules.
“The rules are good because we need to be careful about crossing,” said Pongrawee Kongkul, a student studying English at the USC Language Academy. “We don’t always follow rules, so having officers remind us helps.”
In addition to monitoring the crosswalks, DPS has also asked faculty and students who drive to campus to use another gate to help reduce congestion.
“Anyone who is not parking in Parking [Structure] D should not be going through that gate; it is a restricted access road,” Sandell said.
DPS is also looking for new ways to decrease the congestion in the area. It has decided to videotape the behavior of students and vehicles in the intersection to see what method would work more effectively to keep the intersection safe.
In the meantime, Sandell said, it is important that students pay attention to the signs and officers and dismount their bikes as they are crossing.
“All we want is that they do what they are being asked to do,” Sandell said. “If the first person gets off their bike at the intersection, most times the others will also get off; we need to set the example.”
Thank you, DPS, it is about time!  Can you have a guard there at the end of the day, too?  I have to use that intersection in the morning and evening and I have been hit by bikes and no one ever stops to yield to pedestrians.
I am videotaping the behavior of bikes and other vehicles on this campus, too.  Many students ride with a cell phone in one ear and a ipod bud in the other and they are oblivious to their surroundings. I have been contemplating pressing charges against some of these students, now that I can identify them and have videotaped evidence.
The signs didn’t work because they also stated “No Motor Vehicles.”  It was obvious that the signs weren’t being taken seriously by drivers of motor vehicles or golf carts.  
This is another example of DPS confusing students.  Is it against the law to ride a bicycle through an intersection?  No, it isn’t, as long as you observe traffic signs.  By requiring students to dismount their bicycles, DPS pounds it into our heads (whether they mean to or not) that you’re not allowed to ride in an intersection, which just isn’t true.
This also happens at the the Jefferson/McClintock intersection.  Students see DPS riding their chariots through the intersection while the “Walk” signs are up.  Conclusion?  It’s alright to ride the bike while the walk signal is blinking.  Is this correct?  No… LAPD gives students tickets for this behavior.  
DPS fails to observe stop signs at Child’s Way/McClintock, and at Downey/McClintock.  I can’t speak for other intersections, as I don’t frequent those intersections often, but it happens.
Supposedly, the DPS Bike Patrol helps DPS officers understand the difficulties of biking on campus.  The difficulties of biking on campus include stopping at Stop signs, yet I have never seen DPS Bikes stop at any stop signs.
DPS, when you don’t like what you see, try setting good examples.

Kate Gosselin and partner Tony Dovolani break down on Dancing With The Stars
Just a few weeks into the new season of Dancing With The Stars, Kate Gosselin is already having a tough time. Gosselin has previously fought rumors that she is just an unpleasant diva who is spending way too much time away from her eight kids. On Monday’s episode, during a behind-the-scenes clip, Kate was showed complaining and arguing with her partner Tony Dovolani.
The clip showed Gosselin complaining about being “stressed” and Dovolani feeling that she “undermines” his teaching before turning to him and saying, “you’re not taking into consideration how I learn!” After hearing that statement, Dovolani removed his microphone pack, set it on the ground and said, “I quit.” Gosselin began to cry saying, “I don’t get it!”
As expected, apologies from the duo spilled out on Twitter and on their blog sites all day Tuesday. Both said they were angry at the time of the filming and will work on getting along better. Their relationship isn’t the only thing that needs to be worked on; their dance on Monday night received a 15 out of 30 from the judges! Judge Bruno Tonioli called their routine a “nightmare… you go through the motions like a Stepford Wife. You need to get acting lessons!”
ABC’s selection celebrities this season is definitely working out for them. Monday’s ratings were up an unprecedented 23 percent from last season. Viewership also increased each half hour during the broadcast.
Ricky Martin: “I am a fortunate homosexual man.” 
Radio stations, websites, and early morning talk shows blew up Tuesday morning with talk about pop star Ricky Martin’s announcement that he is gay.
“I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man,” Martin said in a message posted on his official website. “I am very blessed to be who I am.” After years of keeping quite about his personal life, Martin made this announcement while writing his memoir. He said thinking about his twin sons led him to go public.
Though Martin succeeded in keeping personal life from the public eye, the singer said he drew strength from that time.
“These years in silence and reflection made me stronger and reminded me that acceptance has to come from within and that this kind of truth gives me the power to conquer emotions I didn’t even know existed.”
Earlier this month, Barbara Walters told the Toronto Star that her 2000 interview with Martin, where she grilled him about his sexuality, was a mistake on her part. Walters said, “A lot of people say that destroyed his career, and when I think back on it now I feel it was an inappropriate question.”

The following is an excerpt of a 1922 ad published in the New York Times about USC’s pro day:
“ … is promised to be the biggest collection of spangles, gilt, glitter, sawdust, lemonade as pink as the blush of a maid, aerialists, freaks, clowns, trained wild animals, zoological types, elephants, gymnasts, wire walkers, bee-you-ti-ful horses and bee-you-ti-full-er riders…”
OK, it was actually published about the Barnum & Bailey circus coming to town.
But I think they meant this ad for USC’s pro day.
Eighty-eight years later, while you might have trouble finding the elephants, this ad could describe the scene unfolding on campus today. On Cromwell Field, Trojan football players preparing themselves for the NFL draft will work out in front of a crowd of NFL scouts, coaches, general managers, families and friends that rivals the throng gathered at the Vatican on Easter Sunday.
Don’t believe me? Ask Rob Rang from NFLDraftScout.com, who was in attendance last year.
“It’s an absolute circus here at the USC campus, as hundreds of NFL executives, scouts, ex-Trojan players and others close to the program flood the field to get a close-up look at the school’s top talent,” he wrote.
Afterward, Rang continued his assessment.
“The USC pro day was every bit the spectacle it had been hyped,” he wrote. “The fact that the Trojans allow media, former players and family on the field to watch the workout along with scouts made the event the most heavily attended pro day of the year.”
Much of the attention that USC’s pro day received last year was warranted. There was Mark Sanchez and his top-10 draft status; Clay Matthews, who would go on to make the Pro Bowl; and Brian Cushing, who would be named the NFL’s Defensive Rookie of the Year.
The Trojans don’t have nearly as much firepower going to the pros this year, so the crowd, the act and the atmosphere might resemble a mere matinee performance. Yet, that doesn’t mean there is nobody worth watching or players who don’t need to impress.
Time to shine · Departing senior safety Taylor Mays will be among the 15 Trojan athletes working out for scouts at tomorrow’s USC pro day. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The player who will garner the most “ooh”s and “ahh”s from the crowd, and the player who will be under the most scrutiny, will be safety Taylor Mays. The 6-foot-3, 230-pound cheetah had a largely disappointing senior year, although his showing at the NFL scouting combine proved more fruitful.
At the start of last season, Mays was touted as a first-team All-American with safety Eric Berry from Tennessee. There was even talk about him being considered a Heisman candidate. As the year wore on, Mays disappeared from the national discussion and the top 10 in obscenely early mock drafts.
Other than his much-scrutinized 40-yard-dash time, which I’ll get to in a minute, his NFL combine results arguably fell below expectation. TFYDraft.com’s Tony Pauline called Mays’ showing at the Senior Bowl and NFL combine “poor performances.” In the field drills, Pauline said Mays had trouble backpedaling and would often stop completely to change direction.
And despite his freak-of-nature athleticism, Pauline insists that “Mays is likely to go later in the draft than someone with his measurables usually would.”
Many people have Mays going in the late first or early second round in the draft next month. Pro day will give Mays a chance to show off any improvement he might have in his defensive back drills and impress the scouts and coaches in attendance.
But unfortunately, what was going to be the highlight of today will not happen. Mays said yesterday he will not run the 40-yard dash, which arguably would have been the most anticipated and noteworthy 40 yards run on campus in USC’s history.
There are two reasons for this. Firstly, nobody of Mays’ size should ever run the 40 as fast as he does. Secondly, nobody actually knows how fast he really is.
At the combine last month, Mays ran an official 40-time of 4.43, or .03 seconds behind the fastest tight end, nevermind the .15 seconds he finished behind the fastest finisher — wide receiver Jacoby Ford.
Yet, many people in attendance had Mays’ time clocked in the 4.2’s — some as low as 4.24, which would have tied with Chris Johnson’s combine record. When the NFL Network superimposed the fastest runners from all six positions onto on clip, Mays finished second, a hair behind Ford, leading many to validate their claims that Mays’ official 40-time was wrong.
With this announcement, nobody knows the next time Mays will run a clocked 40.
Without Mays running the 40, a lot of focus will be on running back Joe McKnight and receiver Damian Williams, the other two high-profile Trojans entering the draft. Both could make millions of dollars today — or lose millions of dollars, adding even more intrigue to the circus.

Last week, junior pitcher Chris Mezger said the bullpen had to step up. He said the group of relievers had to minimize the damage and avoid the big inning. He couldn’t have pitched any truer to his words Tuesday night in USC’s 9-7 win over host Loyola Marymount at George C. Page Stadium.
Relief · After USC senior Shuhei Fujiya was unable to record an out in the first inning, junior Chris Mezger pitched four scoreless innings. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (13-12) moved to 5-1 in midweek competitions thanks to Mezger’s ability to come in and quell a Lions’ rally early in the first inning.
“Mezger did phenomenal tonight,” USC coach Chad Kreuter said. “I’m extremely excited about how he’s been pitching.”
LMU (13-12) chased senior Shuhei Fujiya from his first start as a Trojan before he even recorded an out. Fujiya loaded the bases with a pair of walks and a single through the right side before the Lions’ most dangerous hitter, Matt Koch, doubled down the left field line driving in two runs.
LMU’s infielder Matt Lowenstein followed with a RBI single that spelled the end of the day for Fujiya. Kreuter made the call to the bullpen for Mezger, his most versatile reliever. The lanky 6-foot-10 right hander was stellar once again, getting out of the jam and allowing only a squeeze bunt to score Lowenstein.
Mezger baffled the LMU hitters for four innings, allowing only one single while recording three strikeouts. He picked up his third win in relief, improving his record to 3-0 and lowering his ERA to 1.80 in 20 innings.
Juniors Logan Odom and Ryan Cabral and sophomore Brandon Garcia pieced together four innings, giving up single runs in the fifth, sixth and seventh innings before sophomore Chad Smith came in to slam the door shut in the ninth inning. Smith struck out two Lions’ batters and then induced a ground ball to third base to earn his second career save — his first this season.
“Chad had some really special stuff tonight,” Kreuter said. “We would like to have a defined closer, but right now the defined role in our bullpen is the hot hand.”
After scoring only one run in Sunday’s series finale at Stanford, the Trojans wasted little time getting on the scoreboard against the Lions. It took only two batters.
Junior second baseman Joe De Pinto was plunked by a pitch to lead off the game, and sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa doubled to the left-centerfield gap to score De Pinto. Oropesa came in to score later in the inning when LMU’s starting pitcher Aaron Griffin uncorked his first of two wild pitches.
USC continued the scoring in the second inning with another pair of runs on freshman shortstop Adam Landecker’s first career home run.
“We had a hit-and-run play on with a 2-0 count, and he fouled it off,” Kreuter said. “So I put [the hit-and-run] back on and he hit it over the big wall in left field.”
The shortstop reached base three times in the contest, scoring a pair of runs.
“It’s fun as a coach to watch another young player have success,” Kreuter said.
De Pinto also had a pair of runs and a pair of RBI after he drove in two runs in the top of the fourth inning. USC knocked Griffin out of the game and stretched its lead to 8-4 in the fifth inning with a pair of runs, including sophomore infielder Matt Foat’s fifth home run this season.
Griffin (2-2) was saddled with the loss after allowing eight runs (seven earned) on six hits and five walks in four and two-thirds innings.
Koch, Lowenstein and outfielder Ryan Hawthorne each recorded multi-hit games for LMU.
The Trojans will be back in action when they host Oregon State for a three-game series beginning Thursday.

There he was, standing in the middle of the field during the first day of spring practice for USC — the young, built coach sporting a white polo, black shorts and white visor pulled low on his forehead, replacing the short, gray-haired, sweatshirt-wearing ball of energy.
Digging in · Sophomore signal-caller Matt Barkley drops back for a pass at Tuesday’s practice. Coach Lane Kiffin said Barkley and senior Mitch Mustain would share snaps at quarterback at the start of spring practice. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan

Within the first few minutes of practice, starting quarterback Matt Barkley and prized recruit, running back Dillon Baxter, ran a lap around the field seemingly for a fumble caused by a poor exchange between the two, something that was rarely seen in the Carroll days.
“We’re going to have to fix our mistakes, just like in a real game,” said Barkley, who couldn’t remember the last time he ran a lap for disciplinary reasons. “I trust [the coaches] and believe they are making us better.”
They weren’t the only players running laps. Wide receiver Brice Butler ran about three laps for showboating after making two separate catches in one-on-one drills.
There were more changes to practice besides the disciplinary measures.
Walking in, it was clear that security was tighter. While DPS officers were present in the past, they were very relaxed and watched practices. Now, a few officers stood facing the crowd with their backs to practice.
On the field, after running a few offensive drills to start, the team spent about 30 minutes focusing on special teams. Kiffin had the offensive and defensive linemen catching punts and running backs and receivers smothering kicks and scooping up loose balls.
“There was a little bit of a different vibe because we were doing new special teams stuff,” running back C.J. Gable said.
When asked if he had ever done that much special teams work before, Gable didn’t think long.
“No, I haven’t,” he said.
Despite these small changes, the practice still had the overall feel of USC practices of old.
The team had an 11-on-11 scrimmage to end practice and the up-tempo style didn’t disappear. If anything, the players were a little too enthused.
“I liked their energy but we have to practice a little smarter,” Kiffin said. “There’s a lot of trying to be Troy Polamalu on day one. We’ve just got to manage the way we practice. But it’s a lot easier to slow them down than speed them up, so that’s good.”
Also familiar were the hundreds of people on the sidelines watching practice. However, most of them were media personnel, former players or family members since the USC staff has decided to limit practice to pre-approved guests who submit requests at least 24 hours in advance.
“I know before it was an open practice, anybody could walk in,” Kiffin said. “We just have changed the way we monitor a little bit, tighten it up and have a process of making sure who’s coming in — obviously for compliance reasons.”
In other on the field news, highly touted freshmen Baxter and wide receiver Kyle Prater took part in all of the team’s drills. Prater is still limited in movement by a sore hamstring but he ran routes with the team and caught passes from Barkley and Mustain.  The two quarterbacks split reps throughout practice as Kiffin said they would. Even though Barkley is the incumbent starter, Kiffin declared the quarterback competition open Monday.
Tight ends Rhett Ellison and Blake Ayles didn’t practice. Ellison could miss all of spring practice with mononucleosis; Ayles is suffering from an ankle injury.

Nicholas Sparks’ novels are formulaic, simple and cheesy, but girls love them. Adaptations of Sparks’ novels have the potential to be transformed for the screen into an epic love story, like The Notebook, but they can just as easily fizzle out into Razzy-worthy trainwrecks. The movie version of The Last Song was a giant “almost” in every way: it was almost funny; it was almost touching; it was almost good.

The novel, on the other hand, was another Sparks hit. Sparks focused on the unique father-daughter relationship between a Juilliard-caliber teen musician and her concert-pianist dad, while appropriately keeping the daughter’s charming teenage romance as a side plot. But Hollywood, exploiting the lovesick 13-year-old demographic, shamefully skipped over the father’s storyline in favor of the more marketable make-out scenes.
The movie starts off with Ronnie Miller (Miley Cyrus), a moody, hormonal teenager, and her little brother being forced to spend the summer with their estranged dad, Steve (Greg Kinnear). Ronnie blames her dad for almost everything and spends most of the movie hating him.
Despite Cyrus’ natural aptitude for portraying adolescent attitude, her character still lacks the depth and dimension required for believability. A teenager going through that much pain cannot be taken at face value; as written, Ronnie could be an enormously complex character, but Cyrus doesn’t even begin to tap into the character’s depth.
Leave it to Hollywood to instigate a complete 180 by instantly converting Ronnie’s hatred into love after one kiss from teen heartthrob, Will Blakelee, played by Liam Hemsworth. Despite her death-stare scowls and generally depressing aura, Will pursues Ronnie with impressive yet questionable persistence.
The lack of character development and abrupt transitions rob the movie of any hope of passing as a respectable, quality film. It seems as if the movie and many of the characters were inspired by elements of Sparks’ most successful film adaptation, The Notebook.
The Last Song’s love scene montages are set up exactly the same way as they are in The Notebook, with a beach scene, car scene, dinner with the rich family who doesn’t accept the relationship, etc.
Even while watching Cyrus it’s almost impossible to not think of Rachel McAdams, for Cyrus mimics many of The Notebook star’s mannerisms.

Unlike The Notebook, however, The Last Song just falls short. All the components of a good love story are there, but it simply isn’t executed with the same quality of acting, originality or commitment.
Once the movie steps away from the typical love plot, however, it gains back at least some semblance of respectability. When the father-daughter musical connection finally re-emerges, authenticity came with it.
The montage scenes in which Ronnie and her dad get to know each other while his sickness worsens actually mimic the romance scenes, but do so with much more success. Kinnear and Cyrus’ chemistry as father and daughter makes for a particularly heartrending relationship as the father’s condition deteriorates.
All the actors handled themselves with maturity and believability in the emotional scenes at least, which was a pleasant surprise.
At the end of the day, The Last Song is enjoyable — it just isn’t enough to surpass its predecessors. Cyrus is cute and lovable, Hemsworth is charming and swoon-worthy, the music is classic and the little brother is adorable. The film achieves what it sets out to do, but not much more than that.
In so many respects, the movie is almost there. In a couple years, Cyrus might perfect her acting abilities, and she might turn out to be an actress — just not yet.

As students are reaching for the snooze button, members of the ROTC Alpha Company of the Trojan Battalion have already completed a four-mile run and more than 200 sit-ups and push-ups — all by 7 a.m.
And this is just the beginning of their day.
Step in line · ROTC students, who are often seen marching around campus, start their training early in the morning, participating in physical drills to train them for military service. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Although they’re often seen around campus, very few people actually know what it means to be an Army ROTC student.
“People need to understand that we’re not just wearing uniforms and running around campus,” said James Wise, enrollment and scholarship officer for USC Army ROTC.
The Army ROTC is a leadership course that is part of a student’s curriculum. Through classes, leadership labs, physical training and field training exercises, students learn firsthand what it takes to lead others, motivate groups and conduct missions as an officer in the Army.
“We recruit under certain criteria called SAL: Scholar, Athlete, Leader,” Capt. Paul H. Ruopp III said. “We want people who are smart, athletic and who have a natural leadership quality.”
Every cadet must apply and be accepted to USC before they can apply to join ROTC.
“The biggest misconception of ROTC students is that we’re not smart and that we’re all meatheads,” said Cadet Dennis Caserza, a senior majoring in computer science.
Reasons for joining ROTC vary. Some join as an opportunity to pay for college while securing a future in the military — all ROTC members are given scholarships — while others wish to continue a lineage of military service in their family.
But it’s not the decision to enroll in ROTC that makes these cadets unique — it’s the reason they stay.
Only 65 percent of ROTC sophomores stay on for their junior year, Wise said. By the end of junior year, however, the retention rate jumps to 95.4 percent.
The program is not for the faint of heart or weak in mind, Wise said. Cadets have to commit eight to 10 hours a week as well as complete a military science course and weekly leadership labs.
Upon graduation, most ROTC students will be commissioned as second lieutenants in the Army. They will endure six to nine months of training where they will be in charge of a platoon of 30 to 60 members, Wise said.
But the ROTC program is more than preparation for the armed forces. It instills structure, discipline, time management skills and initiative in its cadets.
“ROTC doesn’t just teach you about military tactics on the battlefield and physically train you,” Caserza said. “ROTC motivates and inspires you to reach your full potential in all aspects of your life.”
Cadet John Graff, a junior majoring in English and print journalism, said ROTC has taught him both leadership skills and personal discipline.
“I haven’t found any other organization that asks this much from me on a daily basis,” he said.
Being in ROTC demands great sacrifice and selflessness, cadets said.
“As a graduate student, I have a 16-hour internship, five graduate school classes and a lot of reading. In addition to that, ROTC requires [physical training] Monday through Thursday every morning and two additional classes,” said Cadet Cassandra Rush, a graduate student studying social work.
Many ROTC students are involved in Greek organizations, student groups, marching band and athletic groups on campus. Cadet Chris Cheng, a junior majoring in international relations, will be the Undergraduate Student Government president next year.
Approximately 30 percent of ROTC cadets are female. Although ROTC is predominately male, the expectation for women to perform is no less. They run alongside the men, do the same physical conditioning and do not expect any accolades for it.
“ROTC students form a bond that is hard to find elsewhere on campus, as we constantly challenge ourselves and overcome difficulties both individually and as a group,” Caserza said.
There is an expectation to see the individual as part of something greater than one’s self.
“ROTC asks us to put aside every little insecurity and anxiety that we have in our own private lives, be invulnerable in front of the group and be a source of inspiration,” Graff said.

It’s 9 a.m. and the line at Trojan Grounds is already stretching out the door. With bags under their eyes and slumped postures, the exhausted students wait until they reach the counter. Upon reaching the front of the line, they order something that will transform them from weary, worn out individuals thinking more about bed than books into assertive, eager college students ready to conquer the day’s challenges: coffee.
According to the National Coffee Association, Americans drink 400 million cups of coffee per day.  A study published in 2007 said 68 percent of Americans felt they were addicted to the drink.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
Students across the United States are witnessing the growth in the overuse of coffee — or, as many like to call it, addiction. With students routinely not getting enough sleep, many crave the drink as it gives them the energy and focus to get through hours of class without falling asleep.
The number of coffee addicts is even higher among university students because they face situations involving pressure, deadlines and little sleep ­­— three common causes leading to the overuse of coffee. Coupled with poor time management, procrastination and partying that lasts into the early morning, the urge to use coffee as a stimulant to stay awake is very high.
On college campuses, a coffee culture is widely accepted as normal. Coffeehouses and cafes are known on campuses across the nation as establishments that promote learning and the exchange of ideas. Some students claim drinking coffee while staying up late writing papers and studying for final exams is a ritual all college students should go through in order to get the complete college experience.
But what many don’t realize is the overuse of coffee can quickly lead to a caffeine addiction that can cause serious issues affecting everyday college life, such as studying and communicating effectively with others.
In an interview with NYU LiveWire, Dr. Laura Juliano, an expert on caffeine addiction, said “Caffeine is not seen as a drug, but it should be. Education and awareness is vital.”
Drinking more than three cups a day can lead to a dependency on coffee for important functions, such as work, driving and even simply staying awake. Juliano claims caffeine should be treated as any other drug in the sense that the threat of addiction is real, and the physical and psychological effects, can be devastating.
Surely, the average college student doesn’t consider coffee a substance that can be abused.
The first step, then, is to raise awareness so students can be cautioned against potential coffee abuse.
Students need to become educated on the risk they are taking by drinking large amounts of coffee on a regular basis. Seminars on campus sponsored by the health center would be a good start by raising awareness and offering students methods of dealing with caffeine addiction.
Instead of being an instrument in producing progressive thought, discussion and relationships, coffee is becoming a stimulant used solely as a crutch to keep individuals functioning instead of getting the necessary amount of rest.
Hopefully, students will recognize the dangers of this substance and use it in moderation.

On Dec. 5, 2009, we lost our final football game of the season to the  University of Arizona.
On the same day, seven brave Trojans skipped the game to compete in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Competition — an excruciatingly difficult, six-hour, 12-question, national mathematics competition. As a past participant, I can attest to the immense difficulty of this monster test.
The maximum score on the test is 120. The 2009 median score was 2.
In the past 10 years, the highest number of students USC has entered is seven. Each university has a representative team of three — the Trojan contingency scored 52 team points, placing 84th out of 545 universities. Not only did the team arguably face a harder opponent than the football team that day, it also scored more than double the points.
USC is ranked No. 26 according to the most recent U.S. News & World Report, but its professional schools are ranked even higher — the Viterbi School of Engineering is tied for seventh and the Marshall School of Business is tied for 10th.
U.S. News & World ranked the top-five universities overall: No. 1 Harvard, No. 1 Princeton, No. 3 Yale, No. 4 CalTech, No. 4 MIT, No. 4 Stanford.
The top-five finishers in the Putnam exam? MIT, Harvard, CalTech, Stanford and Princeton. The list of top-five Putnam schools going back to early 1990s consist of universities ranked higher than USC.
If USC wants to move into the next echelon of world-class education and ranking, I suggest the university dedicate the same type of resources to traditional academia it has been devoting to the professional schools.
The university’s academic standing improved because of our administration’s dedication to creating elite professional schools. While our professional schools deserve the highest praise, those universities that are most dedicated to the traditional academic pursuit of knowledge and truth consistently rank the highest.
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
According to the fountain plaque on the north entrance to Trousdale Parkway, USC was founded as, “an institution of higher learning dedicated to the search and dissemination of truth.” Many plaques around campus proclaim that, “you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”
USC once required all students to take courses in logic. Professional schools, much like vocational schools, do not teach how to learn, but rather teach what a student needs to know for a career. These schools apply knowledge and seek applications of knowledge, but fail to pursue knowledge for the traditional arts and sciences.
Currently, the university requires all undergraduates to take six classes across various fields in the arts and sciences as a part of the General Education program.  However, the student attitudes regarding the program seem to think of such courses as an afterthought — we only take these classes because they’re a requirement to graduate.
But if the arts and sciences were promoted as heavily as some of the professional programs on campus, it’s likely that such attitudes would change.
The justification for improving the professional schools with little focus on arts and sciences was that those schools had the highest returns of donations from alumni. Although this is true, C. L. Max Nikias, our next president, has the opportunity to increase our academic ranking even further by focusing on the arts and sciences, though doing so might prove difficult because USC has become so professionally oriented.
Our university culture tells us that studying in the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences does not result in a job. We think that English majors will never make money.
The university’s biggest donors might be graduates of professional schools, but improving the arts and sciences to a degree rivaling Princeton and Harvard, however, would result in unapplied “knowledge” majors obtaining jobs previously reserved only for professional major students. In turn, these graduates would be in a position to increase their donations to USC.
In this scenario, USC would rise in the ranks and truly achieve its goal: become the Ivy standard of the West beyond Stanford.
The pursuit of knowledge and truth is a cornerstone in life. Without it, we could very easily live a dull and boring life. In this pursuit, we find ourselves.
The pursuit of knowledge is why people vehemently fight to maintain a liberal arts program and general education at USC. The pursuit of truth shapes us and transforms us to overcome the problems of the world.
USC seeks to be an elite university. With this goal, it must re-establish the pursuit of knowledge and truth among the student body, and it must invest in the arts and sciences so that this knowledge enables professional application.
Nikias would be wise to seek this restoration with the re-establishment of our founding dedication as our fountain and plaques remind us.

Erudite, we were seen as a “party school” in the nineties but only a “party school” AMONG the nation’s top universities. In other words, we partied a little harder than Stanford, but compared to 90% of the nation’s universities we were still considered a high-falutin’ nerd school. When Sample tried to curb things like hazing in the 1990s, many of us (I was an undergrad then) thought he would sacrifice our athletic and alumni traditions to turn us into something like Stanford. We were wrong. A decade later, our academics were far higher than before AND our football team was doing far better than in the 1990s. Sample’s efforts proved that academics and athletics are not mutually exclusive. The cohesion of our alumni network, and their enthusiasm for giving back to the school, results from USC’s excellence all around.
BTW, I don’t think you know what “commuter school” means. It means a school that most people commute to, usually because a majority of the student body is from the local area. USC is not a commuter school, because many of our students are from far away places. UCLA is closer to that category. The Cal State schools are better examples.

Jensen, 
I agree with everything you wrote. As Trojans, let’s not repudiate the fact that USC was once a “party school” with lackluster academics that only immersed itself in football. Oh, you young Trojans don’t know huh? Well, to make the long story short, USC in the early 90’s and prior was an academically inferior school to many. While we jeered at UCLA for losing against us in football, they jeered back even harder at us for us offering lenient admissions and overpriced, private-school tuition. Do you know the implications to what a “commuter school” is? Well, USC used to be one. A “commuter school” isn’t academically challenging because students can commute back and forth to and from home to school because the academics do not take a significant toll on their time; in other words, the academics are easy. I don’t know what the hell presidents and administrators prior to Sample were thinking in letting this school demonstrate complacency in academics while being hellbent on beating everyone at football???
Currently, my cousin who’s a senior in high school holds to the notion that USC is an academically lenient school. She attends an academically competive high school not far away, Peninsula High in Palos Verdes. I don’t believe she is near the top of her senior class, but she thinks that USC is a cakewalk to get accepted to, that’s why she didn’t even bother applying to UCLA nor Cal Berkeley…because their academics are much more difficult and that USC is the “easy alternative.” My cousin is bright, but she’s no valedictorian nor “perfect SAT score” girl. But…USC needs to take concrete steps to extirpate these notions of academic inferiority/leniencey. And I understand the bad economy will significantly decrease the number of applicaitons submitted thereby affecting admission rates. 
First things first, let’s not worry about trying to be the “next West Coast Ivy” a la Stanford, or even try to be on par with the Ivies. Let’s be on par with that other school across town that is dubbed the “public Ivy” with its many notable researchers and Nobel Laureates–UCLA. They still trump us in academic prestige, and if you don’t think so then look at those college rankings again. 
President Sample did an excellent job, and let’s hope Nikias can do better.

If it wasn’t weird enough that the man who pioneered art-rock freakiness’ latest musical contribution has a guest vocal slot on the new Gorillaz album, now it comes out that the punk scene stalwart has a new addition to the telecommunications world—an iPhone app.
Introduced via a disturbingly Warholian YouTube commercial, LouZoom turns any regular iPhone into a grandparent-friendly big-button phone by making contact names stretch across the entire width of the phone’s screen. Contact info becomes so big that the app creates scrollable pages for each person in your phone, apparently perfect for Reed, who in the video struggles to select his phone’s tiny letters with the point of a Japanese sword.
We all know that 60s musicians are heading down the geriatric highway, but the app’s existence brings to light an overlooked aspect of that fact. As our rock stars age, they also join the population of senior citizens attempting to grapple with our generation’s new technologies and though they may be staging reunion tours and premiering self-scored documentaries about 100 year-old cousins, they seem to be just as hard-to-convert as the rest of the AARP members.
No word on whether the 68 year-old musician actually programmed the iPhone app himself, but he does get credit for not buying a Jitterbug and skipping over the obvious “LouRead” app-naming opportunity.

As the opening of USC’s Ronald Tutor Campus Center nears, USC Hospitality is slowly announcing the food vendors on its Facebook and Twitter accounts every Monday.
So far, Hospitality has revealed that California Pizza Kitchen, Lemonade and Carl’s Jr. will be opening in the Campus Center’s food court.
The first restaurant, California Pizza Kitchen, was revealed March 2. According to USC Hospitality Director Kris Klinger, 77 percent of students polled about what dining options they most wanted to see in the Campus Center said they wanted to see CPK in the new food court.
This will be the third opening of a CPK on a college campus, Food Management reported.
Lemonade, the second dining option, was revealed March 16. The restaurant will offer sandwiches, pastries and house made lemonades, teas and coffee. Grub Street Los Angeles called the chain an “upscale cafeteria” that has been rapidly expanding.
This Monday, Hospitality announced that Carl’s Jr., a current favorite at The Lot, will be joining CPK and Lemonade in the campus center.

The University of Texas El Paso will introduce former USC coach Tim Floyd as their new head coach at a news conference at 6 p.m. today.
Multiple sources say that Floyd was the front-runner for the job and a favorite among UTEP boosters to replace former Miners coach Tony Barbee.
Barbee left the Miners to coach at Auburn, not before leading the team to a Conference-USA regular season title and a first-round NCAA tournament appearance.
This will be the second coaching stint for Floyd at UTEP.  He first served as an assistant coach under Don Haskins from 1978-86.
His coaching career also included stops at Idaho, Iowa, and in the NBA with the Chicago Bulls sans-Michael Jordan and the New Orleans Hornets.
After his stint in the NBA, Floyd returned to the college ranks and took the head coaching job at USC in 2005.
While with the Trojans, Floyd compiled an 85-50 record and coached the team to a Pac-10 tournament title in 2009.
Amid allegations and rumors of NCAA violations regarding recruiting rules following the 2009 campaign, Floyd stepped down from his position at USC.
Floyd met with the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions in February.  USC conducted its own investigation into the alleged violations and ultimately decided to self-impose sanctions on the basketball program.
The NCAA committee is expected to make a decision sometime within the next month.
Multiple sources told ESPN.com that UTEP was assured Floyd would not be individually penalized for his alleged NCAA violations at USC.
Good article, hope to see more from Trevor.
