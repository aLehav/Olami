With 12 seconds left on the clock in Las Vegas, sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright tossed up a 3-pointer. The ball sailed in an arc and swished definitively. It was exactly what the Trojans needed, but the shot summed up the game for the Trojans — too little, too late.
In the teams’ third meeting of the season, the Trojans fell 76-74 to the UCLA Bruins on Thursday night in the second round of the Pac-12 Tournament. The night was highlighted by an 18-point performance from junior point guard Jordan McLaughlin, but poor shooting and tough defense from UCLA kept the Trojans from ever taking the lead.
The Trojans began with one of their slowest starts of the season, missing their first 10 shots from the field. UCLA took advantage of the offensive drought, leaping out to a 14-3 lead. For the first 10 minutes, the Trojan offense looked lost against the UCLA zone.
“Our best players didn’t play very well in those stretches,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “Our starting lineup has to do a better job. You can’t just go 0-for-8 or 0-for-9. Our starters have to do much better or they won’t be starting much longer.”
A rhythm developed slowly under the leadership of junior guard Elijah Stewart, who came off of the bench to lead the Trojans in a first half comeback. While the Bruins had the chance to put the Trojans away early in the half, they also struggled from the field, shooting 45 percent in the first half.
Although the Bruins led by as much as 12 points, the the Trojans continued to chip at that lead. Key 3-pointers from Boatwright, freshman guard Jonah Mathews and Stewart gave the team scattered bursts of life.
The Trojans’ increased success in outside shooting was not matched, however, in the paint. The presence of sophomore forward Chimezie Metu was missed throughout the first half as he fought against the UCLA big men in the post. 
Typically a team leader, Metu didn’t net a single basket in the first half. In the paint, he was terrorized by the likes of UCLA point guard Lonzo Ball and UCLA center Thomas Welsh, struggling to work through blocks and double teams. Even when he was fouled, Metu couldn’t get a basket to drop from the free throw line, and his lack of offensive production was felt heavily by the Trojans.
After finding a rhythm and pulling within 3 points toward the end of the first half, the Trojans stumbled again at the opening of the second half. Metu finally notched his first basket of the half, but the Bruins proceeded to open up a 9-0 run that sent the Trojans reeling.
Again, the main obstacle for USC was finishing from both behind the arc and underneath the basket. The team finished shooting at 38.7 percent, but at times in the second half that percentage was as low as 30 percent. The Bruins weren’t much better off, finishing at 41.2 percent from the field, but their ability to capitalize on USC mistakes kept them steadily ahead.
“We’re streaky,” Enfield said. “We’re a streaky team offensively. When we get it going, we can score a lot of points in bunches. We’re not turning the ball over. We missed some easy shots tonight, but we’re playing solid basketball at both ends.”
The Trojans launched another comeback late in the second half, kick started by the catalyst of a perfectly timed pass from McLaughlin that Stewart slammed down for an alley-oop and a foul. Stewart followed the play with a 3-pointer, cutting the lead to 2 points at 71-69. From there, the Trojans continued to pressure the Bruins but could never overcome the 2-point deficit mark. 
With a minute left, the scoreboard read 74-71 with the ball in the Trojans’ hands. Boatwright saw a perfect opportunity to tie from the top of the arc and took it, but the ball ricocheted off the rim. Stewart was forced to use his fifth foul to stop the clock, and then the Bruins took a 5-point lead.
The next time down the court, Boatwright knocked down the shot. But with four seconds on the clock, there wasn’t enough time for the Trojans to react. The final buzzer sounded and the Bruins escaped the second round of the Pac-12 tournament.
Now, the Trojans wait for Selection Sunday to determine if and when they will play in the NCAA tournament. Questions were raised in past weeks about the Trojans’ ability to make the tournament, but definitive wins against Washington and Washington State quelled some of those concerns. Despite Thursday’s loss, Enfield believes that his team will be equipped and ready for the big dance.
“Our staff is extremely proud of our players to be here where we are right now and to compete against the best teams in the country,” Enfield said. “We’re gonna lay it on the line and do our best.”

Katie Chin | Daily TrojanMoving on · Freshman guard De’Anthony Melton comes around a block and drives toward the paint. The Trojans stayed neck-and-neck with Washington on Wednesday night, but pulled out the win to advance to play UCLA.
It was not the ideal start they expected, but USC managed to use a second half rally to come away with a tightly contested 78-73 victory over Washington in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament Wednesday night at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
After trailing the Huskies by a basket at the half, USC opened the second half on a scoring run that gave it the only lead change of the game. 
A 3-point field goal from Washington sophomore guard Matisse Thybulle put the Huskies ahead of the Trojans 37-27 with 3:33 remaining in the first half. USC responded by finishing the first half on a 10-2 run that was capped off with a dunk from USC sophomore Chimezie Metu. The Trojans trailed Washington at the half, 39-37. 
USC’s 14-5 run to open the second half gave the Trojans a 52-44 lead over Washington with just under 15 minutes remaining in regulation. USC took its first lead of the game on a dunk from Metu that put it ahead of the Huskies, 43-42, with 17:25 left in the second half. This dunk from Metu gave USC a lead it would not relinquish for the remainder of the game. 
The Trojans used a 9-0 scoring run midway through the second half to solidify its lead over Washington. A 3-point field goal from junior guard Elijah Stewart gave the Trojans their largest lead of the game at 67-53 with 9:10 left in play. 
“We were just being smart and trying to take care of the basketball tonight,” junior guard Jordan McLaughlin said to the Pac-12 Network. “I was just trying to make the smart play and tried not to force things out there.”
Washington was able to pull within 3 points of USC with just over 20 seconds remaining in play. However, USC redshirt junior Shaqquan Aaron was able to hit a pair of free throws after being intentionally fouled to put the Trojans ahead by the final score of 78-73. 
Metu was the offensive catalyst for the Trojans Wednesday, as he recorded game-highs in points scored (24) and rebounds (9) against the Huskies. 
Defensively, USC put together a stout performance against Washington in its first Pac-12 Tournament game. The Trojans, who finished the regular season as the top-stealing team in the Pac-12, were able to swipe away a total of 14 steals Wednesday. 
USC’s steals were able to contribute toward its transition attack, as the Trojans finished with 18 points off of Washington’s 17 turnovers in the game. 
Washington had a strong shooting start in the first half against USC. The Huskies finished the first half by hitting 16-of-28 (57.1 percent) shot attempts. Washington opened the contest by hitting five of its first nine shots (72.7 percent) from 3-point range.
USC was able to advance to the second round of conference tournament play despite a difficult night shooting from long distance. The Trojans finished Wednesday night shooting only 4-for-16 (25 percent) from deep. 
With the victory, USC (the No. 6 seed in the tournament) will now take on No. 3 seed UCLA in the second round of the Pac-12 Tournament Thursday night at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. 
This will be the third consecutive season in which the Trojans and Bruins do battle in the Pac-12 Tournament. USC and No. 3 UCLA split their regular season series in 2017, each team taking the matchup on its respective home floor. 
“We’ve just got to bring the energy and come ready to play,” McLaughlin said. “The last time we played them we came out with energy, but we kind of quit on ourselves in the second half. We’ve just got to bring out energy.”

Katie Chin | Daily TrojanEyes on the prize · Senior attacker Cynthia Del Core drives on the attack. Del Core recorded her eighth hat trick game of her career.
The Trojans won in dominant style at home over Boston University on Wednesday, defeating the Terriers 15-4 to defend their No. 4 ranking. Junior goalie Gussie Johns cemented the defense with eight saves, seven ground ball captures and three turnovers on her way to becoming the school’s all-time saves leader.
While Johns broke records in goal, the Trojans defense also put on a smothering show to limit BU to only four goals. Junior Lydia Sutton forced three turnovers and picked up two assists while clearing the ball, and freshman midfielder Kerrigan Miller forced an additional three turnovers while serving up an assist of her own and winning three draw controls.
The Trojans were the first to strike, with senior attackers Kylie Drexel and Drew Jackson netting goals off of free positions, and Miller followed to bring the score to 3-0. The Terriers responded with a goal of their own, but the Trojans built up an 8-1 lead after a 5-0 run led by two goals from senior Cynthia Del Core.
Del Core lit up the offensive attack for the Trojans with a career-high 5 points, earning her eighth hat trick game of her USC career. Senior attacker Michaela Michael also notched two goals to move into the fourth place overall slot for all-time scoring in MPSF history with 167 goals.
Three other Trojans picked up two goals apiece, with Jackson, senior attacker Gabby McMahon and sophomore Gabbi Klein each finding the back of the net twice for the Trojans. Jackson and McMahon paired their goals with an assist and a caused turnover each.
On BU’s side of the ball, sophomore Mickenzie Larivee led the Terriers with a pair of goals. Freshman Kailey Conry and sophomore Molly Kern netted the other two goals for BU. Although the Trojans pounded BU’s defense, senior goalkeeper Caroline Meegan picked up 14 saves and grounded three balls. However, the effort wasn’t enough to slow the Trojans’ offensive rhythm.
The game was the first time that the two programs had met on the lacrosse pitch. With the win, the Trojans improve to 31-5 on the season.
The team also improved to 17 games in a row won at McAlister Field. The home streak was lengthened to 19 this season, and USC has only dropped eight games total in its all-time home record.
The Trojans now look to their next home matchup against New Hampshire (0-5) on Monday. The team will then take to the road for a New England tour before returning home to kick off Pac-12 play and defend their spot at the top of the conference.
The New England trip will provide its own challenges for the Trojans. The week will open up with Dartmouth, a team that finished in the Top 40 rankings in the NCAA despite struggling to keep a .500 record late in last year’s season.
Then, the Trojans will face another Ivy League threat in a matchup against No. 11 Cornell. The top-ranked team is 3-1 so far this year after blowing out Villanova, Pennsylvania and Colgate.
After five days of rest, USC will then face No. 7 Stony Brook, a team that heavily relies on the powerful sister pair of Taryn and Kylie Ohlmiller on the attack. Stony Brook will put pressure on Johns, as their attacking style is one of the fiercest that the Trojans will face this season.
The East Coast tour will finish off with a matchup against Ohio State, a team similar to Dartmouth that also finished in the Top 40 at the end of last season. The two straight weeks of top-tier competition will provide a necessary challenge for the Trojans, who are currently coasting at 4-1 with a sole loss at No. 3 Florida. The next three weeks will help decide the Trojans’ record as they enter the core of the season.

Spring football practice kicked off this week, and needless to say, there is plenty of hype surrounding USC’s 2017 prospects. Why wouldn’t there be? The Trojans have looked close to unstoppable ever since redshirt freshman Sam Darnold seized the starting quarterback mantle three games into last season, and no opponent seems to faze USC as long as the 2017 Heisman Trophy favorite is under center — not even Alabama.
Just ask tailback Justin Davis and wideout Darreus Rogers, two NFL-bound Trojans who played with Darnold during his breakout 2016 campaign. At the NFL Combine this week, the duo discussed USC’s ugly 52-6 loss to the Crimson Tide in last year’s season opener, which came before the dawn of the Darnold era in USC football.
“With Sam Darnold, man, with him at quarterback, anything can happen,” Rogers said in an interview with AL.com. “The kid is special. I feel like it would be a better game, closer game, and I feel like we probably could have made the upset.”
Davis agreed with his former teammate.
“Oh yeah, it would have been a totally different story because our team — we always knew we were going to be great at the end,” Davis said. “But it was a matter of when we bought into the system or whatever. We thought we were ready for the first game, but we obviously weren’t.”
There are plenty who share the pair’s sentiments. But even with my infinite optimism when it comes to Trojan football, my first thought when hearing Rogers and Davis’ comments was: C’mon, fellas. There is no disputing USC’s meteoric rise back to national relevance, which culminated in January’s intoxicating Rose Bowl victory, but the fact remains that Alabama has participated in every single College Football Playoff since the system’s inception, winning one national championship in the process. What makes the Trojans so sure they could avenge a 46-point loss in a hypothetical rematch?
It’s tough to imagine USC stopping the Tide’s running game even after their Rose Bowl victory, especially behind Alabama’s trademark, monstrous offensive line. Penn State running back Saquon Barkley pounded the Trojans for nearly 200 yards in the Rose Bowl, and the Nittany Lions finished 55th in the FBS in rushing yards. What would Nick Saban’s seventh-ranked unit do? 
Furthermore, Darnold technically did play in September’s matchup (albeit off the bench as a raw redshirt freshman) and didn’t exactly flip the script. He completed 4-of-8 passes for 29 yards, adding nine yards on the ground in three rush attempts. The unflappable gunslinger that would emerge weeks later was nowhere to be seen. If he got a second shot at Alabama, would Darnold be able to rise to the occasion against by far the stingiest defense he has ever faced?
Despite my initial reaction to this hypothetical, the answer to that question has to be an unequivocal yes, right? Because regardless of what you see on paper, Darnold has yet to falter in the face of a challenge. His stats are outstanding, of course — you’d expect that from the reigning winner of the Archie Griffin Award (given to college football’s most valuable player). 
But without relying on quantitative analysis, Darnold also just flat-out makes plays. Who can forget his first start at the Coliseum, when he grabbed a fumbled flea flicker against Arizona State and ripped a throw down the sideline to hit sophomore wideout Deontay Burnett for a 40-yard gain? And Darnold was back at it just a week later against Colorado, picking a botched handoff off the grass and firing a dart to sophomore tight end Tyler Petite for a touchdown.
Not to say that pulling plays out of your ass is enough to take down Alabama — but it certainly helps. It has taken some of college football’s greatest improvisational quarterbacks to sink Saban and his Tide, from Matt Stafford to Tim Tebow to Cam Newton, and finally Deshaun Watson this year.
One of the more recent examples came from Johnny Manziel. Hopefully Darnold will not follow Johnny Football’s path beyond college, but the two share playmaking parallels. During Texas A&M’s shocking upset in Tuscaloosa, Ala. in 2012, Manziel took a snap in the red zone, maneuvered in the pocket and bumped into his own lineman. The ball coughed out of Manziel’s hands, but the quarterback stuck with it to make a spectacular play; he plucked the ball back out of midair, rolled to his left and hit a wide-open receiver in the end zone. It was positively Darnold-esque.
After everything we Trojan fans saw last season, it’s not difficult to imagine Darnold slicing and dicing the Alabama defense like Manziel did. I can’t really cite any figures to back this up: The Tide trumps the Trojans in the vast majority of statistical categories. 
Nevertheless, there is simply a feeling that, with Darnold, USC’s ceiling is infinite. And that is why I’ve just spent all this time dissecting a passing, hypothetical comment at the Combine — because hopefully it won’t be a hypothetical 10 or 11 months down the line. It’s almost a foregone conclusion that we will see Saban’s crew in the CFP again come December. Now it’s up to Darnold and the Trojans to hold up their end of the bargain and set up a rematch between the two teams next winter.
A host of 2016 Trojans won’t be there — including Rogers and Davis. Hopefully, they’ll be proven right.

As the Trojans notched another win on Tuesday night, the team made it clear — a strong bullpen is key to the Trojans’ success. Although the team’s bats have heated up on occasion, USC is finding its strong suit to come on the defensive end of the diamond this year. And when the Trojans get hot on the mound, it only takes a few flashes on offense to bring home a victory.
This proved to be true against San Diego State, which the Trojans took down 1-0 at home on Dedeaux Field. Tuesday’s win was the second shutout of the season, both coming in low scoring games of 2-0 against Duke and 1-0 against San Diego State. The Trojans stayed on top through strong pitching in both matchups.
“When our pitching is on we’re pretty confident that we’re going to win most ballgames,” redshirt junior shortstop Frankie Rios said. 
A balanced approach from the bullpen is key to this pitching success. Sophomore pitcher CJ Stubbs was the first to start a bullpen game featuring junior Mason Perryman, redshirt sophomore Bryce Dyrda and freshman Austin Manning. Stubbs’ start was his first appearance in 2017. He went two innings with a strikeout and no walks. 
“We knew that he was going to be on two innings or 45 pitches, whichever came first,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “He got the two innings in and Mason knew he would have the third inning on.”
Dyrda worked his way out of a bases-loaded jam in the bottom of the sixth with two strikeouts. He struckout four straight batters including the side in the seventh for his first win of his career and a total of five strikeouts on the night. Manning got his second save of the season with two hitless innings. 
“Dyrda came in pumping strikes and Manning did what he’s been doing all year,” Hubbs said. 
The sole run of the game came in the seventh inning off San Diego State’s Alan Trejo. Freshman left fielder Brady Shockey led off the inning with a walk and was replaced by freshman pinch runner Christian Moya. Moya advanced all the way around the bases on sophomore second baseman Brandon Perez’s single and a bad throw to third. 
Junior third baseman Adalberto Carrillo notched two of the Trojans’ five hits on the night, joined by Perez, freshman outfielder Matthew Acosta and freshman catcher Blake Sabol. All five hits were singles. 
The Trojans were active on the basepaths with five stolen bases, two of which came from Acosta. Despite their newcomer status, the freshmen of the team have been a positive force in every game this season. 
“I’d say the whole freshman class has been surprising,” Rios said. “They’re going to be really good.”
Freshman pitcher Connor Lunn received praise from Rios and Hubbs for his performance. Lunn pitched 11 innings over three games with 10 strikeouts. 
Up next the Trojans will face Holy Cross for a three-game series starting Friday at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field. The rotation will look slightly different this weekend. Junior pitcher Mitch Hart is out after being hit on the wrist against the University of San Diego on Friday night. 
“[Freshman pitcher Chris] Clarke is in the mix to start this weekend,” Hubbs said. “It’s just a matter of how he’s feeling. He felt good on Tuesday, so if he is feeling he good he may go as early as Friday.”
Clarke pitched five innings against UCLA for the win on Sunday. The rotation will return to normal with junior pitcher Brad Wegman on Saturday and sophomore pitcher Marrick Crouse on Sunday. 
“We don’t know a lot about Holy Cross, but we have to play to our strengths and play baseball the best way we know how,” Hubbs said. “If we do that then we’ll be in every game.”
