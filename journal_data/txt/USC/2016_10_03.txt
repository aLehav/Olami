Polinav, a new app that allows college students to better engage in campus politics, announced its upcoming partnership with the Undergraduate Student Government at the “Politics Meets Tech” event, hosted in partnership with USC’s Political Student Assembly Monday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Pankaew Boonbaichaiyapruck | Daily Trojan Digital democracy · Luis Rivera, the South Los Angeles area representative for Mayor Eric Garcetti, spoke at the event on Monday evening.
The initiative will allow students to submit their opinions on new programs, contact their USG representatives, register to vote and consider issues such as tuition, mental health and fall break.
“I have definitely seen political apathy on campus during my time here, and we need to meet our students where they are at,” said USG President Edwin Saucedo. “One way to do that is to help students be engaged by using their phones.”
USC is the first campus to launch Polinav, with future launches planned at Northwestern University, the University of Chicago and Georgetown University. Cliff Kang, one of Polinav’s founders, said that his motivation to create the app was to make politics more accessible for everyday people.
“My personal mission was to serve the marginalized, but what I realized is that in politics, in a sense everyone is marginalized, [because] people’s voices get subverted by those who give money,” Kang said. “Our goal is to get enough people to care [about politics] — then politicians have to listen to us, because that’s how democracy works.”
Along with information on USG, Polinav provides users with brief summaries of pieces of legislation in national, state and local politics, as well as potential reasons someone would be for or against each bill. The app also includes ways to contact local representatives.
“[For college students], this is much more local and will affect your life in a very real way,” Kang said.
Polinav invited several other organizations to present how they are using technology to address political issues at Monday’s event. Luis Rivera, the South Los Angeles area representative for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, spoke about how the City of Los Angeles is implementing the MyLA311 mobile app to allow residents to report issues like sanitation, potholes and graffiti removal on their phones.
“[The app] is a way for us to put the power of the city in the palm of your hands, and really allows people to take action,” Rivera said.
Rivera also presented a Certificate of Recognition from the Los Angeles Mayor’s Office, which recognized the efforts of Polinav, PSA and USG to increase civic engagement on campus.
Several other organizations introduced their new apps at the event, including BallotView, which simplifies ballot measures and is set to launch later this fall, the American Civil Liberties Union’s Mobile Justice, which allows people to record police interactions to send to the ACLU, and the civic media organization Voto Latino’s voter registration app.
Toward the end of the event, a representative from the Pasadena Angels investing group discussed how angel investing works for start-up ideas, and the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk introduced a redesigned voting machine and gave voting tips for students.
The Polinav + USG app will be available next week.

At a time when Los Angeles has the largest chronically homeless population in the country, a USC alumnus has partnered with the USC Caruso Catholic center to combat the issue through an unconventional angle — cooking.
Photo courtesy of Jack Lahey A helping hand · Jack Lahey, a USC alumnus, co-created Nourished to help the formerly homeless build lasting relationships with USC students through the shared experiences of cooking healthy food and eating it together.
Nourished is a service organization that connects USC students with residents of supportive housing in the Los Angeles area. During weekly visits, volunteers and residents share the experience of cooking healthy recipes and eating together.
For volunteers and residents alike, what starts as an opportunity to give and receive food becomes a chance to build new relationships and discover new perspectives.
According to Jack Lahey, co-founder and project manager of Nourished and a recent masters in social work graduate from the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, the idea for the program arose from a brainstorming discussion during which he and his adviser Benjamin Henwood, a professor at the School of Social Work, evaluated the best way to tackle the issue of homelessness.
Lahey said that they analyzed other non-profit organizations as case studies, and discovered that while some organizations work upstream to address the institutional forces and social constructions that give rise to inequalities, others try to aid as many individual people as possible.
“What’s good about Nourished is we’re trying to meet in the middle,” Lahey said. “We’re meeting an immediate need, but we’re also addressing long-term concerns about health access, nutrition, preventative health, and alienation and loneliness for somebody who was on the street and now is housed.”
Lahey said that he and Henwood took an analytical and research-driven approach to planning the Nourished program. For example, their emphasis on healthy eating arose from data they found on the rates of chronic disease among homeless people in the United States.
“The health burden on this population is the highest health burden in terms of chronic diseases that any population sees in our country,” Lahey said. “Rates of diabetes [are] around 40 percent, high blood pressure [is] over 50 percent and life expectancy in terms of real years lost is around 10 years.”
Given that many other potential problems accompany living without a stable home, eating healthy    food    regularly is one step toward correcting eating habits that could evolve into more serious health concerns later on.
However, Lahey  said  that the program is about more than just providing people with healthy food each week, as it also aims to educate participants on how to prepare meals based on instructions from the weekly recipes.
Since the recipes are designed to be budget-friendly, diabetic-friendly and low-sodium, residents can take their new knowledge of cooking to their daily lives. The result is an actual change in behavior where residents become more independent and understanding of healthy eating choices.
After preparing the food each night, the volunteers and residents eat together. They chat, share stories and discuss current events.
In the end, there is an exchange of life experiences that broadens perspectives and nurtures understanding.
For Lahey, the work that Nourished is doing has academic and professional value to students because of the way  that it humanizes and connects individual people to the larger issue of homelessness in Los Angeles.
“These experiences put a face to social issues you might write about or academically understand but don’t really have a real emotional, visceral connection to,” Lahey said.

Photo courtesy of Craig Y. FujiiLasting legacy · Vin Scully left an indelible mark on many viewers.
Three of my childhood sports icons — Kobe Bryant, Vin Scully and David Ortiz — all have announced their retirement this year.
On April 13, Bryant played his last game as a Laker. It will be a day that’s forever close to my heart. I got to spend it with my dad, my friend Hailey and our family friend Ralph. While my dad was able to be in Staples Center, Hailey, Ralph and I watched Kobe drop 60 points in his final game together on a big screen at the corner of Figueroa and 7th Streets, surrounded by fellow Lakers fans. In my No. 24 jersey, it was a day well worth the tears.
On May 24, I got to see Big Papi play at Fenway for the first time. Getting to chant “Papi!” in unison with the entire stadium was just one highlight of a day that 8-year-old Jodee had always dreamed about. He hit well and was responsible for four of the team’s eight runs in their victory. Decked out in my No. 34 jersey, it was also a day well worth the tears.
On Oct. 2, both Ortiz and Scully participated in their final regular-season games, one-on-one on the West Coast and the other on the East Coast. After spending the day watching both games and the ceremonies surrounding each, I was reminded of the greatness that both men brought to baseball and to my life. It was also a day well worth the tears.
Originally, I wanted to write about how each of these three shaped both me and my love for sports, but Sunday night something happened and my idea shifted a bit.
At 9 p.m., I went to mass at the USC Our Savior Parish as I do every Sunday when I’m at USC. During the homily, Father Steve Davoren talked about how a couple of weeks back he received an email asking if he’d like to say mass at Dodgers Stadium. This wasn’t just any mass. It was mass on Sept. 25, Vin’s final day at Dodgers Stadium. Growing up a Dodgers fan, Fr. Steve quickly accepted the invitation.
He shared with everyone about the trip of riding down the elevator with Clayton Kershaw, Yasiel Puig, Adrian Gonzalez and the other Dodgers stars. Once down in the room where mass was being held, Fr. Steve talked about how Vin walked in the room with tears streaming down his face.
Fr. Steve thought his tears were only about the fact that it was his final game at Chavez Ravine. But when Vin walked up to Fr. Steve, he shared with Fr. Steve about how he’d just been in the locker room and all the guys were upset about the tragic passing of Jose Fernandez, the Marlins’ star who died in a boating accident last week. He told the father that he couldn’t imagine the pain Fernandez’s parents must be going through and asked for prayers for his family and teammates.
Fr. Steve was shocked. Here was this man — a legendary broadcaster, on his final day at Dodgers Stadium in his 67th year with the Dodgers — and he’s more worried about others than himself.
Fr. Steve tangentially talked about Kirk Gibson’s home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. He joked about how none of us sitting there are old enough to have seen it live and how it was the last time the Dodgers won the World Series. He did a quick sign of the cross in hopes that the team could win it all this season. As a Dodgers fan and the daughter of a Dodgers fan, I’ve heard my dad talk about Gibson’s home run fondly. Not only was it the last year the Dodgers won the World Series, but Gibson’s home run was also on the night of my dad’s bachelor party. So though I didn’t see it live, I’ve seen the clip and heard Vin’s call a multitude of times.
Fr. Steve shared how he can still picture the full count, two-out pitch and remembers Vin’s call exactly.
“The impossible has happened,” Fr. Steve said to the congregation, re-enacting Scully’s call.
Fr. Steve went on to say that Vin just doesn’t call games: it feels like he’s sharing the game directly with you, like you were in the same room. He said Vin can take the smallest instances on the field and talk about them in such a way that they seem like the most important thing to happen that day.
Of course, Fr. Steve tied all of this back to the Catholic faith. He talked about how having faith as small as a mustard seed can lead to miraculous things. He related that famous line — the impossible has happened — to Jesus and the Catholic faith. For me, it was a culmination of two of the things I hold near to my heart.
By the end of his homily, I had tears in my eyes. Fr. Steve so beautifully summed up why so many people are drawn to Vin Scully, why he’s captured the hearts of baseball fans spanning a number of generations, why I wish I could’ve been able to experience more than just the 20 years — not even a third of Vin’s career — that I’ve experienced.
In the games leading up to his finale, Vin said numerous times that he believes he’s needed fans more than we’ve needed him, going so far as to sing that we’ve been “The Wind Beneath [His] Wings.” To the little red-haired boy that fell in love with baseball so long ago and grew into the broadcaster that everyone knows and loves, thank you for saying “enough for a lifetime.” This is Jodee Storm Sullivan wishing Vin Scully a very pleasant retirement, wherever he may be.

It is past 10 p.m. on a Thursday night and the sound of cleats striking the grass, the sight of soccer balls arched into the air and the bright lights high in the sky bring Cromwell Field to life.
Trevor Sochoki | Daily Trojan
This is the men’s club soccer team, the highest level for male footballers at USC because there is no Division I men’s team at the University. Team members say not many students know about it, and even fewer come to their games, but just playing a sport they love competitively is worth the time.
USC used to field a Division I men’s soccer team, but it was removed following the 1980 season and relegated to a club program.
“Ever since then, it’s been a real struggle coming back because of Title IX,” said Jonathan Montesdeoca, the Vice President of the club last semester, referring to the 1972 law that assured equal treatment and benefits to NCAA athletes regardless of gender.
Men’s soccer wasn’t the only sport that was dropped by USC in the 1980s and 1990s; men’s and women’s gymnastics, men’s rowing, men’s cross country, sailing and skiing were either eliminated or became club sports due to factors including lack of finances, facilities and participation, according to a USC spokesperson.
“I definitely wish people paid more attention to us,” Montesdeoca said. “Club sports aren’t really given much attention in general.”
As far as club sports go, however, men’s soccer has arguably taken the biggest step forward. Over the summer, the team traveled to Beijing to participate in the inaugural World Elite University Football Tournament, which hosted college teams from around the world for a competition. USC was the only representative from the United States, competing in the “second group” with Oxford, Peking University and Renmin University.
The Trojans wound up winning first place in their group, but just participating in the tournament — and being the first club team from USC to compete internationally — warranted acknowledgment.
“It’s very significant,” head coach Adam Gootnick said. “I’ve been in this program for six years now, and we’ve never gone internationally or even talked about it. To go international and play and compete on another level and win games is a next step in the process of becoming the best we could possibly become.”
Montesdeoca said the team was offered a spot in the tournament “out of the blue,” with the organizers putting together a “cultural exchange event.” In addition to playing in the competition, the team toured Beijing, visiting the Great Wall, the Forbidden Palace and Tiananmen Square.
“Beijing was an incredible experience, not only to play in another country but to play in a country on the other side of the world that is so culturally different,” Gootnick said.
Ruben España, a senior on the team, also reflected positively on the experience.
“As a team, we really bonded and met interesting people over there, guys from different teams, different countries, nationalities,” España said.
The team came back from China with another accolade to add to a string of recent successes — between 2011 and 2014, the club soccer team advanced to the semifinals or further in either a regional or national tournament each year. The team competes in the California Collegiate Club Soccer League of the West Coast Soccer Association, with the goal of the fall season being to earn a spot in the Championship Division of the NIRSA National Championships.
The team this year consists of 26 players — out of the 90 or so hopefuls who tried out — a mix of players who transferred from Division I, II or III schools and pure walk-ons. Some players had offers from schools where men’s soccer was a varsity sport, but still chose to attend USC.
España was in discussions with Amherst College in Massachusetts. Stuart Young, a junior, was in talks with the University of La Verne, which is near Los Angeles. But he chose USC instead, and despite not having the option to play soccer at the varsity level, it was worth it.
“This is a very good in-between between [attending a top university] and playing Division I, which is more of a job,” Young said. “They play every day, sometimes twice a day. For us, we get just the right amount, which is 2-3 practices a week. Our team is very close because it’s the right amount of soccer and team bonding. It’s the right environment for our team to grow.”
The mix of skilled former recruits with students just looking to play soccer provides an assorted roster for Gootnick, a USC alum in his first season as head coach.
“We have a very diverse group of people who come from all different backgrounds, and even some international players, all way from freshman to senior,” Gootnick said. “Everyone adds different value to the team, whether that be personality, focus, left foot or right foot, in the air, offensive or defensive. There’s so many different tools a soccer player can have, and my job as a coach is to utilize them.”
Players agree that the experience and the environment make the time spent worthwhile. Still, the downsides of not being a Division I team can be frustrating. The team does not draw well at the few home games it has each season. This year, it has three, but in the past, it had been relegated to one or two. According to Montesdeoca, the team also had to move from playing its games on McAllister Field — home of the Division I women’s soccer team — to the less-preferred turf of Cromwell Field. A spokesperson for the Recreational Club Council, which oversees USC club sports, noted that McAlister Field is run by USC Athletics and that RCC has no control over allocating the field to its clubs.
Games have also been canceled due to “scheduling conflicts,” Montesdeoca said. Before one game, the field wasn’t even open, and the team had to call DPS officers to unlock the gates. There, players found that the goals were still locked together and the field lines weren’t clear, forcing them to use cones instead. In another instance, corner flags were missing for a game.
“We just want things ready for a game,” Montesdeoca said. “It’s a lack of professionalism.”
Stuart added that the issues were “embarrassing” to him.
“USC is a very prestigious school,” he said. “When we show up to games and we don’t have corner flags or proper lines set up, it makes us look very amateurish.”
The RCC spokesperson said that club sports in general are of low priority for the school administration and there is a lack of “proper resources.”
Funding can also be an issue, though Montesdeoca pointed out that the RCC paid for a vast majority of the team’s trip to Beijing in addition to providing contingency funds for new uniforms. They have to collect money and gain attention by relying on sponsorships and other creative means, such as having a portion of the Trojan Marching Band play at a game to attract fans. RCC provides some funding, but overall the financial burden falls on the team. This includes tryout dues and a $360 membership fee — up from $300 from last year, in part to cover uniforms and practice jerseys.
Montesdeoca said the ultimate goal for the club is to be a basis for a Division I men’s soccer team, though he has explored other options such as forming a Premier Development League team, which competes in the third-tier of professional soccer in the country.
There are more than enough Division I sports to go around at USC, so perhaps the lack of a men’s soccer team goes unnoticed by a majority of students. But the fanfare and attention is not why members of the club team dedicate late nights to practicing; rather, it’s the chance to keep playing the game they love.
“The soccer alone is worth it,” España said. “Sure, nobody shows up to our games, but we’re here for the soccer, we’re here for each other and we’re here for the experience. Honestly, this is a great way for us to do what we love, de-stress and just have fun.”
Correction: This article previously stated that Jonathan Montesdeoca is the Vice President of the club. He was the Vice President last semester. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Nick Entin | Daily TrojanSuper Sam · After just two starts, redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold is turning heads with his proficiency running USC’s offense. Darnold was named the starter before Week 4 and had his best game on Saturday at home against Arizona State, where he threw for 352 yards.
When redshirt freshman Sam Darnold exited the players’ tunnel and stepped onto the field for pregame warmups this past Saturday, it was his first time doing so as USC’s starting quarterback at the Coliseum. One fan — decked out in USC gear — gave Darnold the coronation.
“You’re the one, Darnold!” he yelled from his front-row seat.
Welcome to Saturday nights at the Coliseum, Sam Darnold.
In his first start at the Coliseum, Darnold took the reins of the Trojan offense and drove them for a season-high 523 yards, en route to a 41-20 victory over the visiting, then-undefeated Arizona State Sun Devils.
Darnold finished the night 23-of-33 passing for 352 yards and three touchdowns. His longest score came on a 67-yard touchdown pass to junior receiver Juju Smith-Schuster, who finished the night with seven receptions Additionally, Darnold ran in a three-yard score during the third quarter of the game.
Throughout Saturday night, Darnold was spreading the wealth offensively — connecting with nine different receivers in the game. Sophomore receiver Deontay Burnett finished the game with a career-high in receptions (7) and receiving yards (93).
“It’s exciting to see a guy like [Darnold], being able to run the ball, being able to throw the ball and run while he’s throwing,” junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson said. “Seeing him out there gets us fired up because we see it in practice and now we are seeing it in games.”
Since Darnold arrived at USC as a freshman last season, much has been made of his mobility and athleticism at the quarterback position. In his first two starts leading the Trojan offense, Darnold has put his ability as a mobile quarterback on display.
In addition to rushing for a touchdown in both the Utah and ASU contests over the past two weeks, Darnold has exhibited an impressive ability to navigate in the pocket and avoid rushers. On several occasions Saturday, Darnold escaped the Sun Devils’ rush and was able to roll out to either find a open receiver or throw the ball away. Due highly in part to Darnold’s mobility, USC did not surrender a sack offensively against ASU.
“[Darnold] just brings some really good movement, and he’s able to make things happen with his feet,” sophomore tight end Tyler Petite said. “And sometimes he can just — on the dot — stop and make a really solid throw and a good decision.”
When USC head coach Clay Helton announced on Sept. 19 that he would be switching quarterbacks, a fair share of criticism regarding the decision followed. Darold has done everything possible to reaffirm the decision which Helton made.
When comparing Browne’s first three games as the starter this season to the last two games started by Darnold, there is evidence that the offense has been revitalized by the latter. Browne failed to surpass the 200-yard passing mark in all of his three starts to begin the season; he averaged 158 yards per game the first three games, which did come against strong defenses. Meanwhile, Darnold has averaged 302.5 yards per game over his last two weeks as the starter. Overall, the USC offense has averaged 494.5 total yards per game under Darnold; it averaged 323 yards a game under Browne’s control.
Darnold’s revamp of the offense has not only shown fruit in the passing game, but possibly even more so in the USC rushing attack. Senior running back Justin Davis has broken out for big performances on the ground since Darnold took over as the starting quarterback.
Against Utah, Davis broke out for 126 yards rushing and a touchdown score. Against ASU, Davis ran for 129 yards — including a 37-yard touchdown run late in the second quarter. In the three games before Darnold was the team’s starter, Davis was averaging 45 yards a game on the ground.
“Offensively, I thought the balance of a 100-yard rusher and a 300-yard passer played very clean,” Helton said. “The distribution to the receivers by [Darnold] and hard running by Justin Davis was the key to the offense.”
While Darnold’s numbers stand out offensively, one statistical category experienced a season-best against ASU: turnovers. USC had its first turnover-free game of the season against ASU, a statistic which is oftentimes overlooked and can make an immense difference.
Following Darnold’s dissection of what was a suspect ASU defense, many have destined Darnold to be the savior of USC football as its rising star at quarterback. When the Trojan offense is pitted against No. 21 Colorado’s defense — which ranks first in the Pac-12 (allowing 290.4 yards a game) —  next week, Darnold’s coronation will be put to the test.

If you’ve ever walked past the hill on McCarthy Quad, you know that “hammocking” is a very popular pastime at USC. With perfect weather almost all year and the shade from trees that don’t lose their leaves (because this is Southern California), the only thing you’re missing is the right playlist of chill music – which is exactly what I put together this week! To put it simply, the best way to describe these songs in one word is “vibe-y.”
Below, I highlighted a few of the featured artists:
 
Billie Eilish
To be honest, I know very little about Billie Eilish, but two of her songs still managed to make it to the top of this playlist. With most songs, I typically prefer the originals over remixes, but “Ocean Eyes” is a strong exception. My favorite version is probably the Astronomyy edit, which is the one I included, but I accidently stumbled upon Blackbear’s remix while working on this playlist and am also very impressed.
Oh Wonder
I’ve been obsessing over Oh Wonder for the past few months, so naturally, I included two of their songs, “All We Do” and “Landslide.” Depending on how I’m feeling, I will oftentimes pick one of their songs and listen to it on repeat for a few days. This week, it’s “Landslide.”
First Aid Kit
I typically associate “Shattered & Hollow” by First Aid Kit with the one time I woke up at 4:00 AM to watch the sunrise – especially since that’s how I felt at that hour of the day. I don’t know if I recommend waking up that early, but this song definitely makes you feel like you are one with the Earth. If not that, then it might induce nihilistic delusions…either or!
Banks
It’s been a long time coming, but Banks finally released her new album, The Altar, on Friday last week, and I’ve been worshipping it every day since. This playlist could’ve easily become a tribute to Banks, but I restrained. Still, it’s only fair that I throw in two of her new songs, “Gemini Feed” and “Mother Earth.”
The Chainsmokers
If you’re tired of listening to “Closer” by The Chainsmokers – or you’re in that weird phase where you can’t help dancing to it, but you also hate that it does that to you – then you can now obsess over the song they released just last week: “All We Know.” In my opinion, it’s pretty much just the relaxed version of “Closer.”

When tuition in the United States costs students an arm, a leg and maybe even a deal with the devil — or a loan officer — it comes as no surprise that many students seek university degrees outside of the country. Though the importance of a college education is stressed from the moment students enter kindergarten, they are rarely educated about the soaring costs associated with higher education. These escalated costs are why more and more American students are going overseas to countries like Germany to earn their degrees.
Emilie Skoog | Daily Trojan
The U.S. does not entirely leave students to fend for themselves, but neither does it prioritize education as much as it should, evident in its meager budget when compared to the billions dedicated to military expenditures. Though officials often justify that military spending is necessary to maintain the American way of life, putting funding for education on the backburner is not only devastating for many students — sometimes deterring individuals who cannot afford high tuition from enrollment — but it is also damaging to the fabric of American society as potential educated taxpayers seek their educational opportunities
Andrew Blackman of the Wall Street Journal recently published an article on the multitude of students seeking education in Germany to take advantage of free education. According to the article, Germany began offering free college education to noncitizens in 2014, setting a goal of attracting 400,000 international students by 2020. Due to low birth rates, the country’s long-term goal involves having these international students establish careers in Germany so they can be integrated into the tax base, enabling the country to continue offering free education.
The article also stated that, as of now, Germany has only 5,000 American students; however, the number of students entering the country from the United States has steadily increased over the past few years. With tuition continuing to skyrocket, it is likely the number of American students opting for a free international education will continue to rise.
Germany has developed a genius plan, attracting educated students from around the world who will contribute to its society and economy. Meanwhile, the United States risks losing a significant portion of its future to countries who can offer their citizens a future without years of debt or financial ultimatums.
In 2014, Business Insider  reported that the United States ranked 19 out of 28 countries studied by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s “Education at a Glance” report, which looked for college graduation rates and upward educational mobility.
Considering the United States is arguably the most powerful country in the world, this is downright embarrassing and even potentially predictive of decline. A higher education is not always necessary for or indicative of individual success, but it is in a country’s best interest to have high numbers of college educated individuals. If the United States expects to maintain its status as one of the best countries to live in, it needs to prioritize the higher education of its students — a college degree not only increases the livelihood and standard of living for many individuals, but it also contributes to a country’s continued growth and development.
Yet for many students, particularly those who not only have to worry about education but supporting their families financially, completing a degree is not always feasible. Sure, it’s possible, but equal opportunity for all is certainly not in the picture. As a 2014 Forbes article put it, many students are either “too poor for college” or “too rich for financial aid.”
Students from middle- to upper-class families may have more money available to them than poorer students, but their annual income is still not enough to cover tuition costs. As the aforementioned article states, federal aid assumes families can pay thousands of dollars for their children’s education when this is not the case. Even students who fall below the median income are still expected to pay out of pocket.
For example, the Forbes report mentions Richard Morais, whose daughter was admitted to John Hopkins University; however, her financial aid package was only $6,000, in stark contrast to the $54,470 it costs to attend in just one year. The family was left with $48,470 on their shoulders. With USC’s estimated cost of attendance for the 2016-2017 school year at $69,711 (tuition alone at $51,442), many students can relate to this financial struggle.
According to a U.S. Census Bureau report, the median household income for American families was $56,516 in 2015, meaning USC’s estimated cost of attendance costs more than the average yearly income can afford.
The United States is a large country, so comparing it to smaller countries like Germany, where offering free services and education is perhaps more feasible, is a bit unfair. However, when looking at the country’s budget, there is a clear need for reprioritization and improvement.
A January U.S. News report stated that federal funding for education has increased by 36 percent since 2002, rising from $50 billion to $68 billion. The biggest portion ($22 billion in 2016) is dedicated to Pell Grants.
In comparison, government military spending surpasses education spending at $596 billion, according to a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute April 2016 Fact Sheet.
The U.S. government no doubt has its justifications for spending so much of its money on military defense, especially after increased concerns of domestic terrorism in a post-9/11 world, but the country’s messy history of military presence around the world raises questions of just how justified this budget is.
Perhaps the U.S. government believes it needs to dedicate so much of its budget to military spending in order to remain the most powerful country in the world, but with a budget that’s more than $500 billion, it far outranks the next country with the most military spending — China at $215 billion.
The U.S. needs to sort out its priorities. It already exceeds foreign military budgets by billions of dollars — it can afford to use some of the money for education instead. What it cannot afford is potentially losing its students and its future.

Back in the ’90s, the hip-hop scene was mostly focused on East and West Coasts. On the West Coast, Tupac was blurring the lines between a rapper and a poet, Snoop Dogg wrote funky hits every single day and who could forget the mack daddy himself, Dr. Dre, who was cranking out hit after hit.
Photo courtesy of Interscope Records Shady’s back · The Slim Shady LP is rapper Eminem’s second studio album and major label debut. It was the album that was best known for turning Eminem from an unknown rapper to famous star.
On the East Coast, Notorious B.I.G. sought the crown to be the best there ever was, Nas made a little-known album called Illmatic that everyone and their mother will tell you is the greatest hip-hop album ever made (disclaimer: it’s not) and the Wu-Tang Clan was busy rocking and shocking the nation with its tough style.
In the midst of all of this, one angsty, Midwestern teenager was finding his voice as a rapper, working on his craft tirelessly day-in and day-out while trying to survive incessant bullying. He transferred schools nearly every year and lived a turbulent domestic life that affected his mental health for years. After releasing an EP that caught the attention of Dr. Dre and making a raw debut album, Marshall Mathers, known by his stage names Eminem and Slim Shady, finished the ’90s in style with The Slim Shady LP.
My first experience with this album was years after it came out; my parents actually had the common sense to not allow their child to listen to an album with three swear words on three tracks of the album. Despite this, I knew who Eminem was as a kid growing up near Detroit. His more “radio-friendly” hits, if there’s such a thing, were popular in my area, especially among kids who loved to hear Eminem be funny and weird but innately talented. For many of us growing up in Michigan, Eminem was our introduction to a lot of things — our city’s identity, pride for our city and, most importantly, hip-hop.
If you ask anyone in Michigan who their top five rappers are and Eminem isn’t at least in the top three, you’re not talking to someone who’s from Michigan. He’s truly ascended from a rapper or musician to an icon, and that is why people from Michigan worship him as nothing less than the second coming. And when I was a kid, I could never understand why until I was old enough to give The Slim Shady LP a listen all the way through. Oh boy.
I knew Eminem was funny, but I didn’t know he had a sense of humor that was darker than a tar pit, which I could appreciate at times, and at others, drop my jaw in astonishment. I still can’t help but laugh at some of the absolutely awful things he says and blush at others.
To say this album is raunchy is a huge understatement. With lines like “I try to keep it positive and play it cool / Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school” not even being the darkest of the lines on this album, I can see why Dr. Dre would pull Eminem aside in the booth and urge him to reconsider the lyrics on his records throughout his career.
Eminem’s rhymes might have been controversial on this album, but he showed that he was gunning for the crown with his wit, wordplay and renowned internal rhyme scheme, which have been dissected countless times by now. However, these skills were still developing at this point. Some of his lines fall flat, like on “’97 Bonnie & Clyde” where, at one point, he makes a string of unintelligible baby noises to make everything rhyme, which just sounds lazy.
This album had a lot of things that I enjoyed, but what’s most impressive to me is how nonchalant a lot of these songs feel, especially since they’re about really serious subjects. In that sense, I felt like something clicked with me when I listened to this album. On the song “Brain Damage,” he raps about being viciously beaten by a bully so bad that he suffers brain damage, something that actually happened in real life, and when he tries to get out of it by seeking salvation from a teacher, she simply replies, “Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I’ma let him.” Eminem has a charm about him when he uses his wit and tendency to over-dramatize. When he does touch on serious subjects, the listener can have a good laugh about the whole thing, then take a step back and think “Why am I laughing at this?”
It’s important to remember where Eminem came from. Not too long ago, Detroit used to be the murder capital, and unemployment rates were astronomical to say the least. It’s an industrial city built by the hardworking hands of its inhabitants. Pair all of that up with the fact that the nearly sunless winters last for about six months and you’ll begin to understand why this album can get bleak at times. However, Detroit doesn’t quit when things get tough, and neither did Eminem. This album is a reflection of his ability to rise above all of the hardships in his life and his surroundings, and look back at it with a good laugh.
Despite its flaws, I love this album now as much as I did when I first heard it. It’s the blueprint of Eminem’s career, the start of something legendary, the commercial introduction of a man who put Detroit on the map. I could also see how this took him from an underground rapper to a star. But it wasn’t everything. While I thought he had skills, I still didn’t understand why some people practically put his albums just under the bible in terms of prophetic works. I began to see why he would connect with so many of my peers, but I didn’t capture the full picture. Eventually, I had an epiphany when I finally sat down with another one of his albums, but that’s a story for another time.

American Honey delivers a compelling story with action, comedy and drama about teenage rebellion during a competitive film season. The movie comes alive with its colors, characters and elegant, goofy execution — and above all, in its leading star Sasha Lane.
In 2015, Lane was spending her spring break in Panama Beach when she was discovered by director Andrea Arnold. An 18-year-old with no prior acting experience, Lane was cast on the spot. The result is a genuine lead performance. Her character, Star, is introduced rummaging through some Midwestern dumpster, grabbing dinner for herself and the children under her care. Arnold’s approach here — in the opening shots of a 162-minute marvel — is minimally explained, with no context as to the children’s care or the disadvantages that have led to their forced bond but extremely telling. Star is continually moving ahead, while her thoughts are clearly anywhere but her home.
In a Wal-Mart parking lot, Star finds Jake, portrayed by Shia LaBeouf, alongside his massive troupe of outcasts, stoners and weirdos belonging to a tightly-run “mag crew.” These “crews,” inspired by real-life The New York Times reporting, are a boozed-out pyramid scheme on wheels, driving door-to-door through flyover country, selling off magazine subscriptions and moving to the next town. Star leaves with the group for Kansas City without a thought, and the movie takes that massive leap as almost a credo, a code of reference. Everything that happens in American Honey feels improvised — the only thing more remarkable is that it actually was.
Photo courtesy of A24 All-American rejects · Andrea Arnold’s film American Honey won the Jury Prize at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The drama features a mix of “street-casted” actors, including Sasha Lane (above), who made her acting debut as Star, and Shia LaBeouf, who plays the role of Jake.
Writer-director Arnold — famed for 2009’s similarly raw, Oscar-winning short film Fish Tank — is obsessed with improvised interactions between young people on society’s fringes and achieved this by actually making up her films on a week-by-week basis. Arnold’s actors, though largely non-professional, seem to be as energized by discovering themselves as we are to discover them, which plays unbelievably well off of the absurdly famous LaBeouf’s pack leader. The actor’s wild-card reputation, while irritatingly well-documented by now, has imbued his movies with a near-animalistic energy for a few years now, and it would seem to have a newer sophistication in American Honey.
The push-and-pull between Star and Jake — playing out in agonizingly patient timing, in some of the most beautifully amber-tinted images of the year — is quirky, achingly romantic and troubling in equal measure. It’s a star-crossed romance filmed in a local backyard. The sense of location is stunning: marrying its loose-leaf story to extremely focused, telling portraits of the smallest details — the way a sunset looks in Kansas City, flies circling around trailers, Monster cans laying around Dakota motels. This is not a movie concerned with message or morals. It’s much too busy building its youthful energy in real-time, with Star’s path to some odd sense of adulthood landing the movie the gorgeous conclusion.
Watching American Honey is like going on the most meaningful, dream-like road-trip with the craziest friend. Even better, it is the rarest and most elusive breed of movie, one that seems to operate on every one of the senses in ways no one understands. It’s perfect, rare and totally American.

As students, we often don’t get the time to cook meals, let alone desserts, but when we do crave them – mug cakes are the way to go! Simple, easy and consisting of very few ingredients, they have become all the rage. Here are three recipes to try:
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Mug Cake
Courtesy of sweetestkitchen.com
The most basic but everyone’s favorite — chocolate chip cookie dough is yumilicious! First, crack an egg into the mug. Next, add in 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, ⅓ cup of flour, 1 tablespoon of butter, and toss in 2-3 tablespoons of chocolate chips. Mix this thoroughly and microwave for about 2 minutes. Enjoy!
 
 
 
 
 
Almond Mug Cake

Want to try something different? Go for the Almond Mug Cake. Add in 3 tablespoons of white cake mix, a few drops of almond extract, and 3 tablespoons of water to a mug. Mix well and then top off with finely cut almonds, sprinkles, or chocolate chips. Microwave on high for 30-40 seconds and you’re good to go.
 
 
Banana Mug Cake

Going the fruit route? Then banana is the best and most easily available. Add 1 tablespoon of melted butter, 1 egg, and 1 tablespoon milk. Stir this mix well before adding in 1 mashed banana. Next, add 3 tablespoons of flour and brown sugar, ½ teaspoon of baking powder to help the fluff. Cook this mixture in the microwave for about a minute to have a gooey banana cake.
What are you waiting for? Experiment now with your favorite ingredients! You could also try with s’mores, coffee, even caramel and apple. All you gotta do is keep the basic ingredients: egg, flour and sugar!
