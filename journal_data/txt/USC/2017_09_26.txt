Hecuba, how do I get a boyfriend? 
— Lonely in Leavey
 
Dear Lonely,
 
Although you’re feeling lonely, I can assure you that you’re not alone in this situation. For the many of us who aren’t Helen of Troy, countless hours have been spent pondering the ancient questions of when and where we’ll find love. 
 
I must admit, additional context and information about you would have been quite helpful for me to answer this question with an answer tailored to you. (Are you a boy or girl? Do you have somebody special in mind? Your personal hygiene is good, I presume? Why do you want a boyfriend?) However, I’ll give this my best shot and try to keep things general.
 
If you’re looking for a relationship, you’ll need to put yourself in a position to meet someone. Join clubs on campus to meet others with similar interests as you, strike up conversations with friendly classmates in your GE classes, and don’t be afraid to ask the lucky fellow who catches your eye if he wants to get some lemonade with you in between classes. In my youth, it was an exciting day when a new portrait painting passed through town that we could admire and review — I’ve heard from friends that Bumble and Tinder are quite similar to this. (Artists often took creative liberties with the portraits they painted, too.)
 
Secondly, one must be lovable. What constitutes as “lovable” widely varies, of course, so I have just one suggestion on this: Be the type of person that you would fall in love with. Read books about things you think are interesting for the sole reason of enjoying it, go learn a skill that you always admired others for having, or find ways to make a difference for a cause you care about. At the end of this, even if you haven’t caught somebody’s eye, you’ll be a better person anyways!
 
Ultimately, however, not everyone meets their person in college. And really, what are the odds that in the entire universe, the one person that is the best fit for you got the right SAT scores, was accepted by a panel to be granted admittance to USC, ponied up the big bucks to enroll here and then met you? Being in a relationship in college can be great, but you also have the rest of your life for that, too. 
 
L, I hope this helps and please keep us updated on your relationship status! 
 
Sincerely,
 
Hecuba

USC placed men’s basketball associate head coach Tony Bland on administrative leave following his arrest on Monday. 
Bland was arrested along with three other NCAA assistant basketball coaches and 10 people as part of a corruption ring, according to federal papers that became public Tuesday. The ring allegedly used bribes to connect top college basketball players with financial advisers. He was released after appearing in court on a $100,000 bond. He is scheduled for appearance in the U.S. District Court in New York on Oct. 10.
Bland was put on administrative leave mid-day on Tuesday after the athletic department was “surprised to learn” of both the investigation and the arrest. The University has since hired former FBI director Louis J. Freeh to spearhead an internal investigation, and reached out to both the NCAA and the FBI to pledge the school’s “full cooperation” in the future.
“We were shocked to learn this morning through news reports about the FBI investigation and arrests related to NCAA basketball programs, including the arrest of USC assistant coach Tony Bland,” USC Athletic Director Lynn Swann said in a statement. “USC Athletics maintains the highest standards in athletic compliance across all of our programs and does not tolerate misconduct in any way. We will fully cooperate with the investigation and will assist authorities as needed, and if these allegations are true, we will take the needed action.”
The FBI also charged Lamont Evans of Oklahoma State, Chuck Person of Auburn and Emanuel “Book” Richardson of Arizona. Besides the four coaches involved, the case charged financial advisers, agents and Jim Gatto, the Adidas director of global basketball marketing.
The bureau held a press conference on Tuesday to address the charges, led by Joon Kim, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Kim described the situation as the “dark underbelly” of college athletes, describing an environment with “managers and financial advisors circling blue chip prospects like coyotes.”
According to an affidavit released by federal prosecutors, investigators have been involved with the case since 2015. At least part of the evidence in the case was provided by undercover FBI agents who posed as partners and financial backers to gain access to the bribery ring.
This document identifies two corruption scandals: one that used bribes to coerce coaches to push their players toward certain financial advisers, and one that paid high school athletes in cash to sign with specific universities. 
Bland was only charged in relation to the first. In July, he had a secret meeting in a Las Vegas hotel room with sports agent Christian Dawkins, who is also charged in the case. The pair discussed the signings of two unidentified USC players — a recent signee and a rising sophomore. 
In the meeting, Bland promised to “mold the players and put them in the lap” of Dawkins, according to the documents provided. The meeting was also secretly recorded. Bland is also charged with overseeing the exchange of envelopes filled with $9,000 of cash to two families of USC basketball players as part of the scandal.
This is Bland’s fifth season with the Trojans, and his biography on the USC basketball website credits him as one of the keys to recruiting players in the last few years of the program’s success.
Bland has served as the associate head coach since 2014 after spending one year as an assistant coach. Prior to his tenure at USC, Bland worked as an assistant coach at his alma mater, San Diego State University.
Both the university and the Pac-12 conference stated their concern over the announcement, which came as a surprise to both parties. The Pac-12 was involved in two cases, with assistant coaches from both Arizona and USC taking part in the scandal.
“Protection of our student-athletes, and of the integrity of competition, is the Conference’s top priority,” Pac-12 Conference Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement. “We are still learning the facts of this matter, but these allegations, if true, are profoundly upsetting to me. They strike at the heart of the integrity of our programs, and of the game that so many people love and play the right way.”

I don’t know how the head coach doesn’t know what’s going on.
USC should definitely lose several scholarships for this debacle.
Upper management, Pres and below must go.
the students and alumni deserve the best.
Another kick in the arse. How many more?
Cue the email from the USC president with the usual mumbo jumbo about “this isn’t what USC stands for” and “appropriate action will be taken.” Like a broken record lately. Between social justice warriors running the show on campus, a dope dealing meth addled doctor/dean, and criminal indictment of a coach in a program fresh off NCAA probation, what in the hell is going on?

Former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito had his license suspended by the Medical Board of California, according to an article published by the Los Angeles Times Monday. A final decision on Puliafito’s fitness to practice medicine is still pending.
The medical board began investigating Puliafito after the Times reported that he had engaged in drug use, kept company with criminals and partied on campus prior to his resignation in March 2016.
Following the initial report, USC suspended Puliafito from seeing patients and barred him from campus and all USC-affiliated activities. The University also launched an independent investigation into the incident by hiring outside law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.
An administrative law judge issued the suspension order as a temporary measure until the medical board completes its probe and reaches a decision, according to the Times story. Puliafito and the state attorney general’s office, acting on behalf of the medical board, both agreed to the suspension.
If the medical board moves to discipline Puliafito, his license could either be revoked or reactivated with certain restrictions, such as requiring him to undergo drug and alcohol testing, according to the Los Angeles Times.
However, the agency conducting the investigation on behalf of the medical board has the authority to refer any evidence  of criminal conduct it finds to local prosecutors, meaning Puliafito could face more punishment than just a licensing penalty.
