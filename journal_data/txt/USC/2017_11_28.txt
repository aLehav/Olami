On Tuesday, the No. 10 Trojans continued prepping for the Pac-12 Championship with extra emphasis placed on readying for Stanford’s offensive weapons. 
Defending the fade 
The fade route is one of Stanford’s go-to offensive play-calls when on the goal line. Since taking over as starting quarterback earlier this month, K.J. Costello has demonstrated an ability to give his receivers plenty of chances in the end zone. With big, physical wideouts like the 6-foot-3, 222-pound JJ Arcega-Whiteside to go along with tight ends Kaden Smith (6-foot-5, 250 pounds) and Dalton Schultz (6-foot-6, 242 pounds), it’s no wonder the fade is a staple of Stanford’s offense. 
Containing the route will be a tough, but essential task for the Trojans’ secondary, which has given up the fourth-most passing touchdowns in the Pac-12. In particular, safeties Marvell Tell III and Chris Hawkins will be tested, matching up against both receivers and tight ends in the end zone. 
“The Pac-12 refs seem to call pass interference every time you touch somebody,” said senior safety and defensive captain Chris Hawkins. “We know they’re going to throw it, it’s what they do, it’s their bread and butter. KJ Costello loves it, hopefully I can sneak over there and snag one of them.”
Love is in the air
In USC and Stanford’s first matchup back in Week 2, the Trojans were impressive in containing star Cardinal running back Bryce Love. Outside of a jailbreak, 75-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, Love rushed for 85 yards on 16 carries before sitting out of the fourth quarter. He never quite took over the game like he has in multiple contests this year, but this time around USC is anticipating a much more impactful performance from the Heisman hopeful. 
“He’s a very patient runner,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. “He’s very explosive once he decides to make his move, and he does a very good job of letting the blockers kinda sort out in front of him.”
Junior linebacker Cam Smith played an essential role in slowing Love the first time, recording a team-high eight tackles. However, he emphasized the importance of entering Friday with the perspective of it being a brand new challenge. 
“For me, I’m going to look at it like we’ve never played them before,” Smith said. “They’ve changed completely as a team, their whole culture seems different … we have to go out there and compete like we’ve never played them before.” 
Trojans crack top 10 
USC moved up one spot to No. 10 in the fifth edition of the College Football Playoff Rankings, behind fellow two-loss teams Ohio State and Penn State. Stanford experienced the largest jump in the rankings, moving up nine spots to No. 12 as a result of their win over Notre Dame.

Thanksgiving was especially joyous for the Los Angeles Chargers, beating the Ezekiel Elliott-less Dallas Cowboys, 28-6, as the Bolts once again proved they won’t quit on the playoff race with some help from their lackluster division.
Two weeks ago, I noted that the team will probably lose against the Washington Redskins or Kansas City Chiefs. This week, the Chargers play the Cleveland Browns, whose head coach, Hue Jackson, is glad to have 2013 All-Pro receiver Josh Gordon back into the fold after serving suspensions since 2014.
Plain and simple, I don’t think the Browns will win this game. They have a chance if their defense can manage to hold Phillip Rivers and Co. under 25 points, but after the Chargers demonstrated great complimentary football against the Cowboys and the Buffalo Bills, I’m putting my money on Anthony Lynn’s team.
Part of the reason why I believe the Chargers are one of the most underrated teams in the NFL is that they’ve been very competitive against some of the league’s strongest squads. Lynn watched his side barely fall to the Eagles, who also defeated Dallas handily, 37-9. And despite being the only team to lose one game this season, Philly managed a mere 2-point victory over Los Angeles. In a narrow 21-13 win, the New England Patriots also found the Chargers were a tough outfit to trounce.
Injuries notwithstanding, it’s difficult to ignore the weak AFC West division when it comes to the Chargers still being alive in the postseason hunt. Whereas a 5-6 team typically has little likelihood of winning the division, the Chargers find themselves within reach of doing so. The Chiefs, once among the hottest teams in the NFL holding a 5-0 record, have gone 1-5 since then. The Denver Broncos have struggled all year, and the 5-6 Oakland Raiders haven’t lived up to expectations.
Two more in-division games are left for the Bolts: one against the Chiefs on Dec. 16 and the other against the Raiders on Dec. 31. Lynn has these matchups highlighted and will try to convince his players that both games are very winnable, harping on the determined attitude needed to overcome their early-season adversity.
“Even when we were 0-4, no one abandoned ship,” Lynn said, via Chargers.com. “Everyone knew what their responsibilities were and how we were going to get there. Guys just stayed the course.”

Students from the Thornton School of Music performed songs with Caribbean, Mexican and Colombian influences such as “Oye Como Va” and “The Girl from Ipanema.” Photo by Wanting He | Daily Trojan
On Monday night, USC Thornton School of Music students held their Latin Pop Showcase, a live event that featured performances of iconic pop songs with influences from the Caribbean, Mexico and Colombia. This showcase served as a final assessment for the students’ Latin pop class and was led by professor Andy Abad, who has had experience with both Latin and popular music from touring with artists like the Backstreet Boys and Jennifer Lopez.
“We tackle as much music as we can,” Abad said. “Everything we brought to the table [throughout the course] we played tonight. This was the longest show we have ever done.”
The showcase began with the entire student ensemble playing an original rendition of Santana’s Latin rock-inspired “Oye Como Va,” a Spanish song with the rhythm and tempo of cha-cha-cha, a quarter-note pulse that originated in Cuban music. The song featured an electric guitar solo from Mallory Fleming-Hauser, a junior majoring in popular music performance.
Throughout the show, Fleming-Hauser switched between the electric guitar, nylon string acoustic guitar and the Cuban tres, a three-course chordophone that she learned for the course. Fleming-Hauser said that she has always been interested in playing all of the different stringed instruments showcased in Latin music and decided to explore and familiarize herself with the different Latin musical styles even further by taking Abad’s class after spending a Maymester in Cuba.
“[Latin music] has a very upbeat and syncopated rhythm, so it took time to adjust to that,” Fleming-Hauser said. “There is a common thread through all of the different types of Latin music, and it was really nice to be able to put all of those together for this one show. I was able to have a greater appreciation for the Latin culture from this course.”
After “Oye Como Va,” the ensemble shifted gears to one of the most popular Latin songs to date: Selena’s “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,” a Mexican cumbia pop song infused with reggae influences.
The song saw Joanna Ceja, a second-year vocal arts graduate student, as the lead vocalist. Ceja’s voice proved versatile throughout, as her strong, belting notes often contrasted with her subtler and more soothing vocals in songs like “Despacito,” which Abad describes as the start of a new and upcoming wave of Latin pop in the music industry.
According to Ceja, one of the main difficulties the students had when preparing the songs was picking up the Spanish language. Although she is a native Spanish speaker, she found that helping her peers with the proper pronunciation of words helped her improve as well.
One of the highlights of the showcase was Ceja’s solo rendition of Juan Gabriel’s “Una Vez Más,” which required Ceja to exhibit her dynamic and powerful vocal range. The performance garnered several standing ovations from other Thornton students.
“[The song] was originally too low for me, so Andy transposed it up a whole step,” Ceja said. “He arranged it to be shorter without some of the instrumental breaks. That’s kind of one of the main issues with arrangement, just making it more adaptable for a school production, shorter and more seamless.”
The showcase featured several Latin musical instruments and introduced a brand-new Portuguese element to the mix when Moira MacKesey-Green, a senior majoring in popular music performance, sang the Brazilian bossa nova jazz song “The Girl from Ipanema.”
“Every year, I am always surprised by the overwhelming talent from the students,” Abad said. “Because I work with a lot of these Latin artists, it gives me special insight to these songs and how to teach them how to play them.”

Located near the intersection of Hoover and West 32nd streets, Casa Barilla opened to the USC community on Monday afternoon as part of a long lineup of new businesses at USC Village. Originating in New York City and with two stores in Dubai, this marks the pasta restaurant’s second location in California. 
When entering the newly opened restaurant, visitors will immediately notice the establishment’s detailed atmosphere. Small additions such as wine glasses behind the counter or Mediterranean cuisine books neatly stacked in the bookshelf make the environment feel even more welcoming.
Patrons are first met with two touchscreen tablets under cabinets of dry pasta, which is one of two options for ordering. The other option is to order through the front counter, receive a number stand and have food delivered to the table.
Casa Barilla’s overall layout is unlike that of a typical restaurant, as the front counter and dining area create an “L” shape. Customers are presented with a variety of seating choices from casual outside tables and rotating high stools to a long table for larger groups. The restaurant’s walls are decorated with white tiles and hardwood floorboards, adding a refined Italian touch to the place. 
The workers care about the restaurant’s cleanliness and the customers’ needs. They are quick but efficient in cleaning tables and reorganizing small things like number stands and the jars of dry pasta that are on display on the tables.

However, the restaurant falls short with its prices. The food is presented nicely on a white plate, but the portion does not feel reflective of the slightly expensive price. A penne al salmone with shrimp, instead of salmon, costs $7. With the only modification to the dish being the meat, this moderate portion of pasta and salmon is not worth its $12.95 value.
This is mostly because there doesn’t seem to be anything too special about the dish, aside from the presentation. The pasta felt slightly undercooked, but its flavor didn’t suffer. With a 45-minute wait for the dish, the pasta should have felt soft instead of coarse because the cooks had more time to prepare the dish. The tomato sauce made this dish feel slightly average. However, the tiny shrimp did taste very well-cooked, and the lemon zest enhanced the dish’s taste even more.
Fortunately, there is a wide array of different menu items. Even though the restaurant is best known for its pasta, it also offers pizzas, paninis and salads. Each type of food has many different entrees made with a variety of ingredients, such as bacon and capers. Casa Barilla also provides more variety with specific pasta preferences such as gluten-free or protein plus. It also offers vegan and vegetarian dishes.
The restaurant also offers three breadsticks for just $1.50. However, their presentation in traditional fast food restaurant wrappers feels contradictory to the “elevated casual” mood of Casa Barilla. 
Overall, Casa Barilla combines friendly service, an appealing atmosphere and a wide variety of menu items to make a restaurant that is worth checking out if you’re in the mood for Italian food. Despite the pricing problem and a few minor food issues, Casa Barilla will be sure to draw in a hefty number of students eager to try USC Village’s newest addition.

The special exhibition will be on view through April 15. Photo by Gabrielle Robinson | Daily Trojan
A new exhibit at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles aims to celebrate the history of a highly underrated and often taboo practice of tatooing. Tattoo, an exhibit about the history and the significance of tattoos all around the world, is currently on view at the museum near USC. The exhibit includes historical records of tattoos around the world, the significance of tattoos to various cultures and the works of contemporary tattoo artists.
The exhibit begins with modern works of tattoo artists displayed on silicone bodies. Some works are accompanied by feature videos, while others have paragraphs explaining the style of each artist. Artists featured include Guy Aitchison, Chuey Quintanar, Kari Barba and other skilled tattoo artists from all over the world. 
One of the exhibit’s most compelling components is a feature on Whang Od, a roughly 100-year-old woman from the Philippines known for traditional Kalinga tattoos, the ancient art of hand-tapped tattoos. Whang Od is considered the last traditional Kalinga tattoo artist in the world and has been hand-tattooing headhunters and women in her tribe for more than 80 years. Today, people from all over the world travel to the Kalinga province and trek to her mountain village to receive a tattoo from her. Tattoo manages to capture Whang Od’s motivations and views toward the art of tattooing in its feature, which includes a five-minute video as well as pictures of her tattoos.
Not only does Tattoo showcase these artistic talents, but it also educates visitors on the history and meaning of tattoos across cultures. The exhibit presents the significance of tattoos in countries like Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Algeria and many others. In some exhibits like the feature on Thailand, the displays play short documentaries on tattooing practices of the nation, showing visitors an in-depth perspective of the influence of tattoos. In the exhibit, pictures and tools used by tattoo artists across time are showcased in clear, simple containers, allowing visitors to easily make comparisons between designs of different artists and places around the world just by a turn of the head.
In more recent times, tattoos have been used to signify negative factors as well. Although tattoos originated among non-criminals in Japan, after the practice was outlawed, it became a popular practice among members of the mafia, or the yakuza. In fact, some public baths in Japan today still prohibit people with tattoos from using them. Tattoo explores these societal views of tattoos and their implications not just today, but also in the past.
Tattoo offers a rare feature that distinguishes it from just another regular exhibit. In the middle of the exhibit, visitors have the chance to actually get a tattoo done from a local tattoo artist in the Los Angeles area with an advance reservation. The tattoo parlor stands as a retro-style room in the midst of dark rooms with clear glass cases, not only giving visitors an even more realistic experience but also supporting local artists in the meantime.
In another effort to draw this exhibition toward local tattoo influences, Tattoo explores in depth the types of tattoos that sprung up in the United States as well as the link between tattoos and circuses in the past 200 years. Inside the exhibit, visitors can learn about popular, contemporary tattoos that originated in Los Angeles, as well as the best local places to get a tattoo.
Tattoo is priced at $24.50 for regular visitors but is discounted at $12.00 with a USC student ID. The exhibition will be on view through April 15.

Catherine Yang | Daily Trojan
Unlike most domestic students, I didn’t go home for Thanksgiving break. Even though Maryland is only a five-hour plane ride away, my family and I decided it simply wasn’t worth spending hundreds of dollars to fly home for a few days mere weeks before the official end of the semester. Instead, I opted for a shorter commute and traveled an hour south to my boyfriend Justin’s home in Lake Elsinore for my first “traditional,” white family Thanksgiving dinner.
The weekend involved heated debate over potato dishes, rounds of blatantly unfiltered Cards Against Humanity games and multiple inebriated relatives. It was definitely an experience, to say the least, and I loved every second of it. 
Meanwhile, back East, my own family — comprising my newly separated parents and younger brother — enjoyed a relatively inconspicuous dinner with our longtime family friends, incidentally also the Yangs. In her signature broken Chinglish, my mother texted me routine updates throughout the day as well as a slew of photos depicting everything I was missing. There was no turkey, no crude jokes, absolutely no hammered grandparents present and pre-dinner prayers took place instead of acoustic guitar jam sessions. Clearly, Justin and I come from very different worlds. 
Late at night on Thanksgiving, after the last of the extended family had trickled home and we’d fulfilled our fair share of supervised underage drinking, Justin and I strolled to the park in his neighborhood and curled up atop the playground with a star-speckled night sky overhead. And we talked. He told me about each of his family members individually — the ones I’d known for months, the ones I’d just met and the ones I’d never meet — about their struggles, stories and quirks. 
As I listened and laughed, I realized how little I actually knew about my own family. Having grown up on the opposite side of the globe from everyone except my nuclear family, I felt oddly estranged. Apart from three or four routine visits to China interspersed across my childhood, my family members are virtually strangers to me. In fact, I wasn’t aware that people outside of my parents, grandparents and brother even existed until I was 5. Instead of counting down the weeks until the next family holiday gathering, we counted down the years until we could afford four summer international flights to the motherland. Factor in an unyielding language barrier, a 12-hour time difference and the fact that each of my grandparents had at least six siblings, and you get a surfeit of relatives who are more myth than reality.

Family has always been an elusive concept for me, complicated even more by my parents’ impending divorce and my attending a university on the opposite coast. During my entire freshman year, I spent a grand total of 20 days at home, and the separation this semester has been just as profound. I’m often too busy to feel homesick, but when I do, I am overwhelmed with guilt and hints of a jealous desire to reap the petty benefits of having a family that lives close by — seeing familiar faces on weekends, being treated to a nice meal or even having groceries delivered to me. 
As inane as it may seem to mention this, most dictionaries define “family” as a group of people who live together in a household and are descended from a common ancestor. In short, family is supposed to be about being bound by blood. I choose to believe Urban Dictionary, clearly the superior source, that family is a group of people who genuinely love, trust and care about each other, regardless of whether they share blood or are forced to spend holidays pretending they like each other. 
I see this definition through Justin’s stories of cutting off toxic family members with whom they no longer wish to associate and in the way his family has repeatedly welcomed me when I had nowhere else to go for long weekends. I see an act of family when his parents interrogate me about my stress levels, offer me career advice and tease endlessly at my expense. I see it in the way my friends here at school take it upon themselves to make sure I’m taken care of, whether that’s by lending me a charger, buying me coffee or delivering a much-needed hoodie to my class. I feel a sense of family in all the little bubbles of campus I live in, from the people I struggle in solidarity with in certain classes to the daily, domestic dynamics of the Daily Trojan newsroom. 
It may not always feel like it when they are 3,000 miles away, but I will always have my real family. They’re the people who care the most deeply about my happiness and have been counting down the days until the end of the semester since I left in August. It’s just a coincidence that we also share the same blood.

The announcement of Meredith Corporation’s planned acquisition of Time, Inc., which owns TIME magazine, amounts to a Koch Industries-funded takeover that has sent shockwaves through the journalistic world. It’s the second recent high-profile corporate acquisition of a major publication; many still remember Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ purchase of The Washington Post some time ago. Both acquisitions — happening in an age when corporate mergers and consolidations are take place more often than usual — have prompted debates about objectivity and sponsorship, with many arguing that The Post’s quality has gone down since the Bezos purchase, and that TIME’s will certainly do so as well.
I don’t doubt claims that publications’ quality goes down when they’re taken over by ideological hacks with axes to grind, but the notion that any publication is truly “objective” in recounting the news seems to belie an epistemological hubris that perversely and unintentionally fuels the perception of a dichotomy between “fake news” and “real news,” which seems to me to have always been less about facts and more about value-laden interpretations of widely disputed facts. If your narratives are “real news” and the narratives outside the pale of yours are “fake news,” then of course the media climate will polarize, as it’s been done lately. But here’s the problem — what the mainstream press gloats about as “real news” is just as much an agglomeration of particular journalistic standards, upper-class bourgeois social values, and fact-selecting narratives pertaining to particular economic and political systems, as any other information-sharing system. That doesn’t make mainstream media “fake news,” and it’s still very much “real news”; but “real news” is more rooted in perception, tradition and culture than we epistemological heirs of the Enlightenment would ever dare admit.
Does anybody really believe that any news is objective, unbiased and without slant? Does anyone really think there’s no constellation of values and norms and ways of knowing and believing underlying the American journalism guild’s particular slate of methods of presenting facts to the world? “Facts are stubborn things,” John Adams said. But then, so are perspectives. The bigger question than “Who’s funding this?” or “What do they have at stake?” is “What is the broader culture of opinion behind this, and how does it shape the stories that are told?”

And the reason I’m not weeping over the new developments for TIME and WaPo is that their purchase by political figures — and yes, the Koch brothers and Bezos are basically political figures — does not represent a slide from objectivity to subjectivity. Rather, it is a potential slide from one subjectivity to another subjectivity — and the new subjectivity, unfortunately, will be less schooled in feigning objectivity than the old one.
I only read TIME every once in awhile, but my basic impression of that esteemed publication remains that it has always been the enlightened gossip of the American non-political middle and upper class, that also happens to have selected Richard Nixon as “Person of the Year” something like 50 times. Its articles are noncontroversial, partly because they don’t make any more claims than they can afford to, and partly because they generally reflect the values, attention spans and worldly understandings of their barber-shop-attending and supermarket-shopping readership. It’s not so much “unbiased news” as it is “news for your average American reader to consume happily.” And yes, the change in ownership will almost certainly have an effect on both its quality and, perhaps, the perspectives through which it analyzes events.
There are ways to combat this kind of ideological ownership and slanting of written media. My beau ideal of a nonpartisan publication is RealClearPolitics, and to some degree Politico’s various national and state Playbooks. A quick look at those, though, reveals that they make no real pretensions to “objectivity“ — they merely attempt to be fair in presenting diverse arrays of perspectives on the same stories and events. They also have wide funding bases. This is reflected in their sponsorships — every Politico Playbook is “brought to you” by a different foundation, industry or advocacy group; RealClearPolitics, low-budget as it is, seems to have a diverse array of donors as well, rather than any single donor.
This kind of countervailing balance between the interests behind the news — a kind of Federalist No. 10 and No. 51 for media sponsorship, whereby the tyranny of one point of view is prevented by the arraying of various points of view against each other — seems to me to be the only real way to keep anything like nonpartisanship, even if it’s not strictly “objective.” Maybe in more local newspapers, integrity and honesty can be maintained among underpaid, overworked, civic-minded reporters. But in a big country with big things at stake, it’s harder to see the epistemologically humble Better Angels of Our Nature governing those who have the most power to influence what people think.
So call this an endorsement of the multiple-source model of journalistic nonpartisanship. And by the way, although it’s not the most “objective” of newspapers, I do subscribe to, read and enjoy The New York Times.

“I don’t doubt claims that publications’ quality goes down when they’re taken over by ideological hacks with axes to grind…” You mean the Daily Trojan? I mean seriously…you guys literally have a column titled “You do Uterus” where some moron just re-writes the same thing over and over. If you want to be a ballast, grow a real pair and truly counter the point.
Excellent work, Mr. Phillips. Contact me via a Follow and then a DM on Twitter if you’d like this commentary to be redistributed nationally. Ted

On Monday, the Koch brothers bought Time, Inc. Well, not exactly, but $650 million from them sealed the acquisition by the Meredith Corporation to purchase the publisher, which includes TIME Magazine, People and Sports Illustrated.
That piece of news will likely disappear from the news cycle in a couple days, if it hasn’t already — eclipsed by the frenzied attempt to pass the GOP tax plan in Congress this week and a continued litany of investigations into sexual harassment in every industry. 
But it should give any avid media consumer or informed citizen cause for concern. The acquisition of the company that holds TIME magazine — which produced in-depth, cutting edge reporting on global warming and the environment — by the Koch brothers — who have spent decades creating media counternarratives against the existence of climate change in the interest of their oil and gas conglomerates — could transform the magazine into another conservative, hyperpartisan, climate change-denying media outlet.
Granted, both Koch Industries and Meredith Corp. have said that the Koch brothers will not have editorial or managerial control of operations at TIME. But as Esquire writer Michael Sebastian pointed out, Rupert Murdoch said the same when he bought The Wall Street Journal, but evidence suggests managerial pressure to generate favorable coverage about the Trump administration. Some think that the Kochs might do the same. 
“Knowing the Kochs, I think they’d have to see it as a business that could at the same time further their political interests,” Stanley S. Hubbard, a donor and associate of the Koch brothers, told The New York Times.

It is heartbreaking that a media institution could have died on Monday. A former TIME editor, Charles Alexander, wrote a moving letter in The Nation preceding the finalization of the deal: “Can you imagine what it would be like to see your life’s work suddenly go down the drain? I can — right now.” 
Yet, the possible fate of TIME isn’t unique. Alexander’s chronicle of the magazine’s demise — in which falling advertising revenues sealed its fate — is all too common about print publications. It could be the sad reality for those who fail to adapt to the digital future. 
That’s why it’s so important for consumers to support the publications that we rely on by paying for them. Ethical journalism became the industry’s bedrock because that’s what consumers demanded — the truth. The present demand for hyper-partisan media has turned this on its head. As media consumers, we created the monster of partisan news, so we also have the power to revive ethical journalism as well. But in the digital era, in which so much news and information is free, we have to be okay paying for it — for subscriptions to institutions like The New York Times and The Washington Post, as well as the smaller regional papers that face massive budget cuts but produce the content that matters to us. 
Economic analysis tells us that free markets underproduce public goods. If we are to recognize unbiased, ethical journalism as a public good, then we have to collectively support it. So, the holidays are coming up — buy a loved one a newspaper or magazine subscription. You’re giving them a gift, but you’re helping us all out, too.

For Lucero Noyola and Jesse Aguiar, the opportunity to pursue higher education was life-changing. Education revealed to them a potential for their future, granting them both personal triumphs and struggles: Noyola navigated through East Los Angeles College by herself, working jobs to raise her child as a single mother. Aguiar, too, found the community college system complex and at times, disheartening.
Lucero Noyola (top) and Jesse Aguiar (bottom) assisted in sponsoring legislation to help foster youth through college. Less than 10 percent of foster youth receive bachelor’s degrees, per Foster Care to Success. Top photo by Tomás Mier, bottom photo courtesy of Jesse Aguiar.
As former members of the foster youth system, Noyola and Aguiar surmounted emotional, educational and financial struggles to graduate college and live independently. According to data from nonprofit Foster Care to Success, approximately 20 percent of former foster youth graduate high school and attend college, and fewer than 10 percent receive a bachelor’s degree. 
In Fall 2016, Noyola and Aguiar worked to sponsor legislation to aid former foster youth transitioning to college life in California, in an effort to combat foster youth’s low success rates in higher education.
“There’s a lack of knowledge, and there is a lot of research that shows that foster youth are not taught leaving the system [to be] prepared for college, but a lot of them have aspirations of attending college,” said Noyola, now a graduate student at the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. “And so, that was what we were trying to solve, to give our [foster youth] community support services on their campuses — to help them persist and graduate.” 
On Oct. 13, Gov. Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 1567 into law, renaming a previous bill to the Higher Education Outreach and Assistance Act for Foster Youth. The bill will require California state universities and community colleges to reach out to former foster youth with available on-campus resources. 
The legislation is crucial in providing emotional support by connecting youth to a community with shared experiences, said Aguiar, director of the Beyond Foster Care program at Journey House, a nonprofit that assists former foster youth in adulthood.   
“I know for myself, I went in and navigated the entire community college application process by myself, and I remember how difficult it was,” Aguiar said. “So, one of the indirect [effects] of this — for me I feel really proud of — is now, when a foster youth steps on a campus, they won’t feel alone, and … from the very beginning, if they answer the question that they were former foster youth, the college application will allow them to have access to community support.” 
Working against the odds 
At Beyond Foster Care’s first event in June 2015, Noyola and Aguiar connected over their similar backgrounds and aspirations as two former foster youth who once faced incarceration and socioeconomic struggle, with desires to enact concrete change in their community. 
“When I met Jesse at Journey House, I was receiving [foster care] services, so I was at USC and [Journey House] would help me with books and supplies,” Noyola said. 
Journey House supported Noyola during her transfer to USC, and she received books, supplies and rent support from the nonprofit. She then connected Journey House to the Trojan Guardian Scholars program, USC’s main support network for emancipated foster youth. 
Noyola had experience conducting research throughout her undergraduate and graduate careers at USC, a skill that caught Aguiar’s attention in his work for Beyond Foster Care. 
Aguiar had previous experience working in grassroots organizing. Aguiar and Noyola began to have conversations about conducting an official study on foster youth, which evolved into the possibility to sponsor legislation on the issue.
“Initially, it was just a conversation we had about issues we felt were very important to the foster care community,” Aguiar said. “From conversations with [elected officials who represent the Pasadena area] … an office reached out to us … [and] they were interested in pursuing some concrete action and asked if we wanted to partner with them on this legislation.” 
After strategy sessions on crafting the intent and language of the bill, the two were notified in January that California State Assemblymember Chris Holden agreed to author their bill. 
Noyola and Aguiar then spent time in Sacramento advocating for their legislation and providing testimony to government officials with the guidance of Serena Kirk, a policy consultant at IDEATE California. 
What was different about Noyola and Aguiar’s campaign, Kirk said, was that almost every individual working to advocate for the legislation or providing testimony was a former foster youth, which strengthened their policy. 
“A lot of times, in policy, you’re representing a population … but in this case, [Noyola and Aguiar] were representing themselves and each other,” Kirk said. 
The two were successful in getting their legislation sponsored in one year with no external opposition from other advocates, an uncommon occurrence in policy, both Kirk and Aguiar said. 
A key aspect of the bill’s success was Aguiar and Noyola’s willingness to compromise when their policy went through various legislative cycles, Kirk said. 
Initially, Aguiar and Noyola envisioned a system that would provide former foster youth automatic enrollment into support programs, as well as a data-sharing component, which would notify California state universities and community colleges that an individual was enrolled at their campus.

“One of the first appropriations and cost analyses done on our bill estimated it to be around $4.6 million [to pass the bill], so that became a very huge barrier for us,” Aguiar said. 
They worked to alter aspects of the bill, such as automatic enrollment in support programs and an automatic notification system for former foster youth, to lower the bill’s overall cost, Noyola said.
“[Aguiar and Noyola] really felt committed to their objective, which was bettering outcomes for former foster youth, but then also making sure they weren’t unintentionally creating barriers within the system that support foster youth,” Kirk said. 
For a better future
“If you hear stories about former foster youth or people who are involved in the criminal justice system, their stories — not to say that it’s not the reality — are told in this very kind of repetitive narrative of trauma, loss, victimization,” Aguiar said.
Both Noyola and Aguiar, who once faced incarceration in their youth, experienced the juvenile system and felt abandoned by society. 
However, the two hope to be remembered for their social work and reform. Their desire to meaningfully impact their community drive them beyond simply explaining their journey as former foster youth.
“I always saw research as a tool to advocate,” Noyola said. 
Before their bill could be crafted, she had worked with a researcher from UCLA to create fact sheets and reference materials on statistics of foster care youth, while taking courses at USC. 
“Being able to support Jesse through my passion of research and seeing how far my work can go, how it can have a real impact on my community — that’s why I want to continue to do this kind of work,” Noyola said. 
When Noyola and Aguiar brainstormed ideas to help former foster youth, their goal was to create concrete action. 
“I think the conversation Lucero and I have a lot, not just with ourselves, but even in our circles away from work, is how do we share our story, how do we use our stories and our experiences in a way that’s different than how they’re traditionally told,” Aguiar said. “Populations are studied from a distance, from an academic standpoint. For us, we wanted to use our experiences to drive insightful [conversations].” 
Although the two were successful in their first legislative endeavor, they have their sights set on sponsoring future policies for former and current foster youth in their transition to independent adulthood. 
“What we did was monumental,” Aguiar said. “All these organizations that are well-funded … [with] senior legislative officials who have years of experience in research and policy work — even the larger advocacy organizations in California don’t always get their bills passed in one legislative session. And we were able to do that with just Lucero and [me].”
Clarification: Lucero Noyola worked independently to create fact sheets and reference materials for the bill, but has worked with UCLA researchers to conduct the preliminary study on former foster youth.
“Populations are studied from a distance, from an academic standpoint. For us, we wanted to use our experiences to drive insightful [conversations]” – very well said!!! Bravo and I can’t wait to see what this duo does next!
