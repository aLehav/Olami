USC Student Affairs has collaborated with student leaders across campus to propose Senior Run, an outdoor block party, in replacement of the annual senior fountain run.
For the past several years, seniors have participated in an unsanctioned tradition of jumping into every fountain on campus the Thursday before spring semester finals.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said that in the past, communication between students and the Dept. of Public Safety and Student Affairs has been effective with regard to the logistics of the Fountain Run, considering the risky behavior that could be involved. Last year, however, proved differently.
According to Carry, twelve students were injured and six students were transported to the hospital for severe lacerations. The destruction of Youth Triumphant, the fountain near Alumni Park, accounted for the majority of the almost $50,000 the university incurred in property damages. Carry said the  2014 Fountain Run resulted in the most significant campus damage USC has ever seen.
“We have a couple thousand students that will come to campus [that night], some of them USC students and some of them from other universities who are coming here with nothing to lose. They’re coming here and saying, ‘Hey, the USC students don’t care about their campus, so we’ll help them destroy it.’ I don’t believe this is what Trojans think about their campus,” Carry said.
He also mentioned that the Fountain Run has become a serious health issue.
“When parents drop their students off the first thing I talk about is student safety and [student] health and wellness,” Carry said. “This is a critical public health issue for us.”
After evaluating the damage at the end of the spring semester, a multi-student governance group,which included members of Residential Student Government, the Interfraternity Council, the Panhellenic Council, Undergraduate Student Government and Program Board, joined Student Affairs in dicussing a new tradition that would replace the Fountain Run.
Carry said that students were appalled by the facts presented. Some statistics included, “$6,582 in ambulance costs (2014)” and “73 medical calls over the last five years.”
After some student leaders became aware of the scope of the damage, they began working on creating the new tradition, Senior Run.
Carry said that Student Affairs hopes the Senior Run will be a safe and enjoyable alternative to Fountain Run.
“Senior Run is great big outdoor block party where seniors get to have safe fun, and they’ve worked really hard,” Carry said. “They’re getting ready to graduate from USC, so they deserve this. We want this to be an opportunity for seniors to have a great time. But first and foremost, our two priorities are we want them to be safe, and we don’t need to destroy our home.”
At a SpeakSC Forum in January, USG President Rini Sampath, vice president of USG at the time, argued that taking away the senior tradition might result in problems.
“Cancellation of the fountain run might create an issue where students are organizing it for a day where DPS isn’t aware,” Sampath said.
Student leadership anticipates criticism from current seniors regarding the cancellation of the fountain run.
Ayesha Misra, a senior majoring in psychology, said she is disappointed by the fountain run cancellation but remains optimistic that the Senior Run will be a suitable replacement.
“It’s really unfair that the fountain run has been canceled this year because this is something our class has looking forward to getting to do for so long, and we’re no longer getting that chance,” Misra said. “If the block party has some kind of crazy fun activity that’s only unique to seniors, like the fountain run was, then that could work.”
USG is concerned about taking away the long-time tradition, but the focus is creating a new tradition that will be more attractive than jumping into fountains. Carry assured the student leaders that it is better for them to be the administration that starts a new tradition than continue one that is dangerous to students.
“There is risk in both sides, but the greater risk is the student administration that maintains a fountain run that ends up taking someone’s life. That is the greater risk, and it’s not worth it,” Carry said.
It’s about time!  I’ve never understood why the University was willing to stand by and watch seniors destroy school property in the name of pre-graduation “fun.”  And why do seniors feel it their inherent right to do so?  Anyone involved in the destruction of property should be held liable and prevented from graduating.
Why don’t you try actually describing what “Senior Run” is? I’m not optimistic about this seeing as how neither Daily Trojan nor the administration seem to have any idea of the details of this Senior Run. Which block is it on? When is it? Is it dry? Give me something I can use. I need more than just a vague reference to a title and Ainsley Carrey arbitrarily telling me he is “hopeful” it will be “just as good” as Fountain Run.

Stephen Smith, director of USC Shoah Foundation, and Hayk Demoyan, director of the Armenian Genocide Museum & Institute, signed a memorandum of understanding on Friday that marks the beginning of a new collaborative partnership between the two groups.
Sixty testimonies from survivors and witnesses of the Armenian genocide will begin to be integrated into the Shoah Foundation’s Visual History Archive by April 24, when both the USC Shoah Foundation and Armenian Genocide Museum & Institute will mark the 100-year anniversary of the Armenian genocide, which took place from 1915 until 1922 at the hands of the Ottoman Turkish government. These testimonies are a part of the Armenian Film Foundation’s collection, recorded by filmmaker J. Michael Hagopian.
The memorandum of understanding will bring the Shoah Foundation’s Visual History Archive containing video testimonies of genocide survivors to the museum in Armenia. The agreement will create opportunities for education and research collaboration between the two organizations on initiatives related to the Armenian genocide.
This new collaboration comes at an appropriate time, as April is International Genocide Awareness and Prevention Month. The Visual History Archive is an online portal that currently gives users access to over 52,000 audio-visual testimonies of international genocide survivors, in 39 different languages. In the past year, the Visual History Archive added testimonies of survivors and witnesses of the 1994 Rwandan Tutsi genocide and from the 1937 Nanjing Massacre.
“It opens up a whole new geography for access and collaboration, given that we’re bringing in the Armenian genocide testimonies into the archives and working with the museum to have the archives accessible,” said Karen Jungblut, the Shoah Foundation’s director of research and documentation. “It seemed like a logical extension for the museum to learn more about what we were doing here … it was an easily aligned mission to bring these materials and testimonies of survivors to an audience in Armenia as well as in the U.S.”
Located in Yerevan, Armenia, the Armenian Genocide Museum & Institute, part of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Armenia, serves as a research and humanitarian body, documenting all materials related to the Armenian genocide and making them accessible to the general public. The museum includes maps, eyewitness accounts, artifacts and other documentation of the genocide during which 1.5 million Armenians were killed.
“We are deeply dedicated to ensuring that those testimonies collected by J. Michael Hagopian over those many decades find their voice[s] in the world. There is no better or more appropriate place to do that than in Yerevan itself,” Smith said. “It’s a place of memory, a place where history emanates from, and, through your leadership, ensures that research and education, which are the fundamentals of our institute too, really ground these testimonies in the world.”
Demoyan said that the collaboration between the two groups marks an important push to pay tribute to those affected by the Armenian genocide.
“This will not stay on the paper … our signatures are triggering something important, triggering the process of research, preservation, study and cooperation,” Demoyan said.
Demoyan also serves as executive secretary of the state commission and is coordinating international efforts to commemorate the Armenian genocide this year.
Jungblut hopes that the two organizations will continue to engage in an exchange of materials and research that will create opportunities for USC students and faculty.
“In the future, we want to really explore all the possible pathways that we can work together and create exchanges on all fronts with dealing with the genocide and dealing with awareness and education about it,” Jungblut said.

At last night’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting, USG President Rini Sampath announced a forthcoming meeting with USC President C. L. Max Nikias to discuss past and future plans.
Sampath mentioned that for the past two weeks, she has consulted her executive cabinet and the various program board assemblies for the topics to be covered at the meeting. Sampath stressed the importance of this official meeting, which comes only once per semester.
“I’ve made it very clear that, in the coming year, any opportunity I have to sit down with an administrator is an opportunity for other students to have a seat at the table,” Sampath said. “I think that in the past, students have often felt disconnected with the administrators and I want to show that this is an opportunity for them to have their concerns heard through the USG leadership.”
Sampath then described the various issues she plans to cover during the meeting. One of the issues she will touch upon is mental health advocacy. Sampath stated that mental health is major issue on campus, and that the number of counselors is insufficient.
“What we find is that [the] Engemann [Student Health Center] … looks beautiful, but it’s probably not the most functional space,” Sampath said. “One student told one of our directors that he got on the phone with someone at Engemann, and the first question they asked him was, ‘Are you suicidal?’ That’s not how we should determine if someone should be seeing a counselor or not.”
Sampath said that the student was then sent an email and told that he would have a three-week wait time before he met a counselor.
“I don’t know if this is just one case, but I think that this is definitely happening to other students if it is happening to one student,” Sampath said. “I want to express to President Nikias that if we have a $6 billion endowment campaign, we need to be investing resources from that campaign to [be] fixing problems like this.”
Another policy point on the agenda, Sampath mentioned, will be sexual assault prevention. Francesca Bessey,  assistant director of Wellness Affairs and a sexual assault activist on campus, drafted a two-page document on sexual assault prevention strategies with Shyann Murphy and Vanessa Diaz, co-directors of the Women Students Assembly.
“If all these activists are putting so much time and effort into events like Take Back the Night with the clothesline project at alumni park, we need to see some kind of response from our administration,” Sampath said. “We want acknowledgement that we have a culture on campus that disrespects women at times, but also things like increasing funding for programming these awareness events.”
During the meeting with Nikias, Sampath will also touch on proposals to establish sustainability efforts. She mentioned that Environmental Student Assembly Director Shawn Rhoads has been working to put together a sustainability plan.
“This is something that USG backs. If we want to be a leading university we need to be looking at sustainability efforts as well,” Sampath said. “The more we want to compete with these top 25 and Ivy League schools, the more we need to be the frontrunners and pioneers in things like sustainability.”
Lastly, Sampath will be discussing the Black House project and minority issues on campus.
“I really want to bring attention to the issues of marginalized communities on campus with our ‘I, Too, Am USC’ project, and I’m hoping to bring some of the photographs from that campaign of students expressing their discomfort on this campus,” Sampath said. “These are the tough conversations that we need to be having with administrators, especially if I have only one opportunity per semester to meet with people like President Nikias.”
When asked if this would be a symbolic meeting, Sampath answered that past meetings with Nikias have brought results.
“The last time that we met, President Nikias told us that he would be looking to waive security fees during events like Spring Fest, which lifts a huge burden from USG,” Sampath said. “That is just one example, but now I think it’s time to go in and ask him these requests that could make our students happier.”
On May 5, Sampath and USG Vice President Jordan Fowler will also meet with Provost Michael Quick to discuss future plans involving the Academic Affairs committee and Academic Culture committee.

Tyler, the Creator is loud, obnoxious, angry and ready to pick a fight with anyone, as evidenced by his Coachella performance this past weekend, during which he insulted Kendall Jenner and the festival itself, calling it “f-cked up” that organizers wouldn’t let his film crew shoot for his tour video.
The angsty idol pre-released his newest album Cherry Bomb online just days before this performance, and it has all the sounds fans love from Tyler, as well as experimentation and features from Kanye West, Schoolboy Q and Lil Wayne. The Odd Future headliner seems to have truly found himself on this album, and though it is rough around the edges, he has finally produced something worth listening to for the first time since he exploded onto the rap scene with his debut album, Goblin.
The album opens with “Deathcamp,” a track full of screams and heavy metal — a perfect opener.
“Named the album Cherry Bomb because ‘Greatest Hits’ sounded boring,” raps the Los Angeles native, full of energy and ready to start a riot with the sounds coming off his album. His style is simple — pumping angry verse after angry verse into each song with lyrical precision, stopping only for skits and love songs. One such moment comes from Shane Powers, host of podcast “The Shane Show,” which is a part of Odd Future’s programming.
“Tyler, Tyler, I swear to, I swear to f-ck! If you f-cking… Do not f-ck this up! You have the whole world in your f-cking hands!” yells Powers in “Buffalo,” which also uses a score of children cheering as an instrumental. Tyler is unafraid, leaving no stone unturned in his quest to alienate and anger every demographic imaginable.
This is nothing new, as Tyler, the Creator has crafted his sound off being a menace to society. Goblin was similarly angry, with lines about his crew like “Wolves I know you heard of us, we’re murderers/ And young enough to get the f-cking priest to come and flirt with us” and other dark, twisted declarations.
Underneath Tyler’s harsh lyrics is a slew of incredible instrumentals that were largely self-produced. The track “Find Your Wings,” sitting snugly between a one-minute hood anthem titled “Run” and the title track “Cherry Bomb,” is jazzy and light, with an airy feel much like that heard in elevator music. The song transitions into an old-school hip-hop beat and a female voice proclaiming the hook, “find your wings,” as Tyler croons.
Immediately following this song however is the heavy drumbeats and rock guitar of “Cherry Bomb,” a track that was made to blow out speakers. The entire song sits underneath a lo-fi static bass that makes it almost impossible to hear.
“I am a god,” sings Tyler on the track, barely audible because of the distortion, but the reference to Kanye West’s Yeezus is clear. Cherry Bomb, much like Yeezus, is experimental, aggressive and exactly what hip-hop needed. So far, Tyler has been on an upward trajectory, launching himself into many different spheres of influence via his clothing line, music and TV show.
There has only been one music video for Cherry Bomb so far, but it features the tracks “F-cking Young” and “Deathcamp,” telling a story within a story about love and anger. The video is charming and stylistic, in a manner befitting the young aggressor’s brand of offbeat wackiness, and the two tracks are both incredible songs. “F-cking Young” is about exactly what it sounds like, featuring the line “When I’m 27 you’ll be 21” and other references to a girl six years younger than the 24-year old artist. Used as a promotional tactic to hype up the album’s pre-release, this video ends abruptly, with a crude graphic listing the album’s release and title. It is purposefully ugly in a counter-culture Internet sense, and it too falls directly in line with Tyler, the Creator’s offbeat style.
The metaphor of flying runs throughout the entire album, and it is fitting considering the high the 24-year-old must be feeling. At such a young age, Tyler has already cemented himself a spot in rap history and continues to succeed despite his alienating opinions. He even rapped with his idol Pharrell Williams for “Keep Da O’s” on Cherry Bomb, tweeting that it was the greatest day of his life, and had the opportunity to feature both Kanye West and Lil Wayne on a track together.
“Smuckers” features West and Wayne putting in verses reminiscent of their earlier works, and it is impressive work considering there is no chorus. The song opens with a piano riff, and Tyler immediately goes in. Everyone’s verses are solid, but Tyler raps before and after each feature and even weaves his own verses through Lil Wayne’s, dominating a track full of stardom. All these artists share one thing, laid out plainly by Kanye in “Smuckers.”
“They say I’m crazy but that’s the best thing going for me,” raps West, cognizant of his status as a high-profile lunatic. Rap is a game of who can be crazier, and Tyler certainly is proving himself to be one of the craziest rappers to ever grace the world. Cherry Bomb is available on iTunes and Spotify now, will be available hard copy on April 28, and I strongly recommend giving the album a listen.
Matt Burke is a sophomore majoring in film production. His column, “Notes on Notes,” runs Wednesdays.
Listening to Cherry Bomb on Spotify! “Fucking Young” is for sure my favorite song off the album.

Veteran Pixar Animator came to USC to give a talk previewing Pixar’s next film, Inside Out. The CalArts grad sat down with lifestyle writer Sara Grzywacz to talk about his time with Pixar and what comes next.
Daily Trojan: Your presentation was very interesting. Your role is art director, what was your role exactly in creating the movie?
Albert Lozano: There are actually several art directors, but I was the art director for characters specifically. My role was designing the characters. The job starts at the beginning where you’re doing a lot of exploration before you get to the final cut of the film. It took about four years and thousands of drawings. It was a long process to get to that back and forth. It wasn’t just coming up with the idea of the characters, but shepherding them through the whole film, making sure the character is acting the way we originally envisioned years ahead of time.
DT: You play a huge role in designing these characters and their personalities. How much leeway did you have in creating them?
AL: Well for this one in particular, I was given a clear vision of something to shoot for, but emotions are inside the mind. So really the sky is the limit. Gosh, what does it look like inside the mind? Let me just try playing with a few things. It was so open-ended; there was no specific trait to follow at the very beginning. Questions that came up were things like, ‘Are they going to be little humans inside the head? Are they gonna be animals?’ When you go inside the mind you can start from anywhere. We couldn’t say it was at a specific location, so there were no specifics at these beginning stages. It became more flushed out as the process went on, but it was a long process getting to that point
DT: You mentioned that you struggled with creating Sadness. What in particular about Sadness made her difficult to create? You mentioned empathy as well, how did you incorporate empathy into Sadness?
AL: I ran into a lot of dead ends with envisioning Sadness when I was at the drawing table. I started viewing her as this dark, goth personification of sadness. That wasn’t really working with what we wanted to do with the film. When we viewed her as a Debbie Downer, who reminds you of how everything sucks, you can’t really get behind that character. You almost want a character that you can sort of root for. The easiest way to say it is the character that you kind of just want to reach up to and hug. When it’s that dark, you just don’t feel as much empathy for them, and when the word ‘empathy’ came up, it became a lot clearer on how to attack Sadness. She is someone who really cares about her girl, who is Riley in this film. She almost takes on all the sadness and the weight it because she loves her girl so much. Once we discovered Phyllis and heard her voice, we just knew instantly she just has that empathy so that really felt like the right way to go with Sadness.
DT: What about the other characters? Did you face any big challenges with the others?
AL: They were all actually challenging. Somebody did ask me which one was the easiest, and I said Anger was sort of the easiest to kind of figure out, and that was never easy in itself. Compared to the others, the other one that was difficult was Joy. With Joy being the main character, the whole film had to revolve around her and her journey. When we thought of Joy it was really difficult to create her where she wasn’t gonna be joyful all the time. We didn’t want her to be overly cheerful [to the point at which] it gets annoying. We sort of think of Joy as somebody you want to root for as well. When we discovered Amy as the voice it really started coming together. We were already really far down the design process with Joy as far as what she looked like and when we discovered Amy her voice fit towards what we were designing and looking for at that point.
DT: You seem to really enjoy working at Pixar. What do you like the most about working there?
AL: I like working with the people. It’s fun to work on these projects but you kind of do have to work in isolation sometimes. You’re tasked to go to your desk to figure out some of these problems but really it’s about working with all of these people. I had a litmus test when I was drawing Sadness, as I said she’s somebody that you want to hug. One of our PAs [production assistants] just graduated from the film school here at USC and started working with us. My test was to just walk by her desk and show her a drawing of Sadness and ask her to take a look. If she looked at it and went “aw,” I’d know that I was on the right path.  I was more excited about getting a reaction out of people. You know, I could stay in my box all day creating these things but the best thing for me is putting it out and showing it to other people and getting their reactions, but that’s just on a smaller level. Ultimately it’s making this entire film that you’re going to put out for the entire world. I was just saying when we put out the screening of the first seven minutes of the film, it was fun for me to look out into the audience and just see everyone reacting to it. That’s very exciting; that’s what I love about working on films. When we screen it at work, we’ve seen it so many times we don’t get any reactions like the ones we got today. This screening at Pixar would be flatlined the entire way through cause we’ve seen it so many times. So getting everybody’s reaction to it, especially during key moments — that’s what we are striving to do and that’s always really exciting. That’s probably the thing I enjoy the most.

What did you accomplish this past weekend? Odds are it wasn’t as cool as what Jordan Spieth did.
Spieth made 21 year olds across every college campus in America look bad in comparison. He wasn’t celebrating that he can finally get into The 9-0 without his fake ID; he was celebrating that he won arguably the most prestigious tournament in the world.
There are some students at USC who didn’t win the Masters, but nonetheless, had pretty solid weekends on a golf course. The members of the women’s golf team proved this weekend that they’re still some of the best in the country and have a great shot at the national championship.
They aren’t exactly on Spieth’s level, but when it comes to the national rankings, no one is really on USC’s level. The Women of Troy came into its final regular season meet at ASU this weekend as the No. 1 team in the country.
The team had a very solid performance, but fell short of winning the tournament. USC finished tied for fourth place, behind No. 8 Arizona, No. 25 ASU and No. 27 Baylor. The team combined to finish six strokes over par, nine strokes behind the first place Wildcats. Given the nature of team tournaments, when four players combine scores over three rounds, a difference like that is comparable to an individual finishing two or three strokes behind the leader.
Individually, junior Annie Park finished third at five under par, sophomore Gabriella Then finished sixth at two under par, senior Doris Chen finished 39th at six over par and freshman Amy Lee finished tied for 45th at seven over par.
The men’s team was also in action this weekend, and it, too, is among some of the best collegiate teams in the country. The Trojans came into their final regular season event as the No. 10-ranked team in the country and finished seventh. The men’s team doesn’t have the same tradition for success as the women’s team, but the Trojans are definitely in the mix and could claim their        first-ever national championship.
The women’s side has been there before. Since 1982, when the NCAA first started fielding a women’s golf national championship competition, the Women of Troy have brought home three national titles. In 2003, 2008 and 2013, all under coach Andrea Gaston, USC finished on top of the team leaderboard. Four other times — 1994, 2006, 2010 and 2013 — the Women of Troy have finished as runners-up.
Individually, the Women of Troy also have a strong tradition of success. USC has had five individual national champions on the women’s side, tied for all-time most. Jennifer Rosales brought one home in 1998, Mikaela Parmlid led USC to the 2003 team national championship by winning the individual national championship and while the team fell short in 2006, Dewi Schreefel was able to win USC the individual title that year.
The two other individual national champions are currently on USC’s roster. Park won the individual title in 2013 as a freshman, 10 years after Parmlid led the Women of Troy to a championship sweep. Last season, Chen was the individual national champion, and she looks to be in the mix to defend her title.
Both of the last two years, the national championship has come down to Duke and USC. Duke has won five titles since 2000, the only school with more than USC’s in that window. Last year, during the four-day national championship tournament, the Blue Devils had a total score of 1,130 strokes, a mere two strokes ahead of USC.
When it all adds up, there’s a lot of variance over the course of a season with a golf team. No. 2 Washington, No. 3 UCLA, No. 4 South Carolina and No. 5 Duke finished 14th, ninth, fourth and seventh respectively at ASU’s tournament. ASU, barely in the top 25, and Baylor, not even in the top 25, both finished in the top five at the tournament. Though crowd noise usually isn’t a factor, home course advantage can be crucial when traveling and course familiarity comes into play.
Like any other sport, the matter of inches can be the difference between a green and a sand trap or a made and a missed birdie putt. But unlike any other sport, there is a huge degree of variation in the conditions depending on the location of tournaments. Football fields are all the same length, basketball hoops are all the same diameter but golf courses can be very different. The speed of the greens, width of the fairways and the general difficulty of the course are never exactly the same at different courses. Despite the inherent unpredictability of the sport, the Women of Troy have one huge advantage going into the NCAA tournament: experience.
Golf, more than any other sport is intensely mental. Obviously, it takes some technique to consistently drive balls onto the green and some hand-eye coordination to read it and sink putts, but so much of the game is about being in the right mindset. It’s very easy for golfers to psych themselves out while playing, especially in a high-pressure situation like a national championship tournament. But the great equalizer for pressure like that is having been there before. With two individual national champions on the roster and top-two finishes the last two seasons, experience is exactly what the Women of Troy have. The No. 1 ranking does put a target of some sort on the team’s back, but the Women of Troy don’t have to face the pressure of defending their national title.
They have nothing to lose as a group — they just have to use last year’s finish as motivation to win back what was there two years ago.
As fellow columnist Darian Nourian wrote last week, USC is due for a national championship this academic year, and the women’s golf team probably has the best chance at making that happen.
So I’m going to take his prediction from last week one step further: the women’s golf team will win the 2015 national championship. Of course, it’s not a guarantee, but I honestly think the Women of Troy have the best shot out of anyone to win the title.
Now that would be something worth celebrating at The 9–0.

The No. 1 Women of Troy made the trip down south to Irvine for their final duals against Concordia and Irvine Valley College before the Pac-12 Invitational. Both duals went well for the Women of Troy as they defeated both teams 5-0. The Women of Troy improved their overall record to 21-0 while IVC fell to 7-5.
With these dual wins, the Women of Troy matched last year’s longest winning streak of 21 wins. Head coach Anna Collier was very pleased with the outcome of the matches.
“We played really well,” said Collier. “We wanted to continue to work on and concentrated on these aspects. I am pleased that the team used these games to work on these aspects and get better.”
In the first match of the day, USC played Irvine Valley College for the first time and they won another 5-0 sweep. All five pairing for the Women of Troy won in straight sets.
The Women of Troy No. 5 pairing Bria Russ and Jenna Belton defeated Taylor Askins and Carleigh Peterson 21-18 and 21-10. The No. 3 pairing Norton and Ettinger won the clinching point for the Women of Troy.     No. 1 pairing Claes and Hughes for the Women of Troy won 21-9 and 21-13, improving their overall record to 30-3.
For the second time this season, the Women of Troy played and defeated Concordia with a score of 5-0. Sophomore No. 1 pairing of Claes and Sarah Hughes defeated the No. 1 pairing of Marissa Boyd and Rachel Flynn by a score of 21-4 and 21-9. The clinching point was achieved by Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler, who defeated Kaila Ames and Samantha Palmer by a score of 21-13 and 21-7 on court four.
There were several milestones that were achieved by a few pairings. Claes and Hughes reached the 30th-win mark as a pairing and are only the third pairing in USC history to achieve this. Both pairings of Norton and Ettinger, and Strange and Bukovec reached the 25th-win plateau.
After these two duals, the Women of Troy are set to face off against other Pac-12 teams in Santa Monica on Saturday and Sunday. The Pac-12 invitational will be played at the beach, which will offer different experiences for the Women of Troy.
“I am really looking forward to the competition this weekend,” Collier said. “I am also looking forward to playing on the beach because the National Championship is on the beach and there are different skills that are used on the beach.”
The Women of Troy have a few days of practice before they have to go right back to playing. With 21 straight wins the team has had great momentum during the season and hopes to keep it going during the Pac-12 invitational.
“With such lofty goals, the Women of Troy are headed in the right direction and are now headed into postseason play with their number-one overall ranking,” Collier said. “We have to get back to practice and challenge them once again. We need to create a new notch in the belt and just constantly keep moving.”

After losing their first weekend series of the season, No. 10 USC (27-9) battled the Pepperdine Waves (20-18) yesterday to eventually come away with a 2-0 victory after 11 innings of scoreless baseball.
Junior pitcher Kyle Davis             (1-0, 5.11 ERA), who has struggled this season after having a stellar sophomore year with a 1.12 ERA, went two innings before being replaced by junior Bernardo Flores in the bottom of the third inning. Flores managed to keep the Pepperdine offensive in check with six strikeouts and four innings pitched as well as prevented any serious scoring threats.
Much of the Trojan offense was characterized by hard-hit balls launched directly toward fielders that stranded base runners, such as during the top of the fifth inning when senior Dante Flores scorched one up the middle that was caught during an outstanding dive and toss by Pepperdine’s Manny Jefferson to get the third out at second base.
After a commendable job on the mound, Bernardo was replaced by junior Tyler Gilbert in the bottom of the seventh inning to retire the side.
During the top of the ninth, Jeremy Martinez led off with a double off the wall in deep right-center to bring up Robinson, who laid down the sacrifice bunt to advance Martinez to third with one out. After an intentional walk to Dante Flores, pinch runner for Martinez, sophomore Corey Dempster, was thrown out at home to make the third out. Junior David Oppenheim then struck out to end the inning, stranding two runners.
The Trojans again missed an opportunity to advance runners in scoring position during the top of the ninth. Freshman Adalberto Carrillo lead off the inning with a chop single to the Waves’ shortstop.
Junior Marc Huberman entered the game for the Trojans during the bottom of 10th inning. After getting into some trouble with a wild pitch advancing runners to second and third, Huberman managed a huge strikeout to strand the runners and enter to the top of the eleventh.
The Trojan offense finally came to life during the top of the twelfth inning, starting with a lead off double by Carrillo and subsequent key bunt by Reggie Southall to put runners on the corners with no outs. After a catcher’s interference call, red shirted junior Bobby Stahel moved to first to load the bases.
After two quick outs, Timmy Robinson approached the plate with two down and the bases still loaded before hitting the essential single into shallow left center, bringing home both Carrillo and Stahel to put the Trojans up 2-0.
Huberman then took care of business during the top of the 12th, retiring the side and securing the 2-0 victory for USC after a slow offensive showing by both teams.
Hubbs feels that lethargy and overall lack of energy primarily lead to his team’s less-than-impressive offensive showing.
“We have to find the pitches that are ours to hit, and we were lethargic today in that respect,” Hubbs said. “We need to get our swings off when we get our pitch as opposed to swinging as we hit the ball forward. I think as the game went on, we had had better at bats. I think the biggest thing we have to do is play with more energy and play a cleaner game. Luckily our pitchers were able to mix pitches in and move the ball in and out. All four kids pitched really well today, which we obviously needed considering we didn’t score until the 12th.”
Despite the Trojans’ struggle during the beginning of the game, Hubbs feels pulling out a win during an extra-innings game on the road attests to the tenacity and conviction of his team.
“I think this win shows a lot about the kids’ mentality and that they’ll grind things out and be relentless as we always talk about,” Hubbs said. “We’ve been through extra innings before. We beat Washington after 15 innings a few weeks ago, so the guys know they can mentally push through long games and grind it out to come away with the game.”
This weekend, the Trojans will host the University of Oregon Ducks (21-16 overall, 4-8 in the Pac-12, 9-7 away) for the first time this season.
To win this weekend, Hubbs stressed the importance of coming out strong and carefully selecting pitches.
“The biggest thing we have to do this weekend is come with more energy and play an overall cleaner game,” Hubbs said. “We won’t have long practices in these next few days, but really targeted practices focused on pitching selections and base runners. My main message for the team is we have to be able to start strong at the beginning of every weekend, every game in order to win and if we can do that, we’ll be in good shape to win.”

A California bill regarding the personal choice to opt out of mandatory vaccinations among children in school was passed by the Senate Health Committee last Wednesday. Senate Bill 277 will only allow children who have been immunized for various diseases, such as measles and whooping cough, to be admitted to California schools. The bill is for the greater good, as opting out of vaccinations poses a greater risk to the health of the general public.
This debate was already resolved on a national level, as the Supreme Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination in the 1905 case Jacobson v. Massachusetts. The court’s decision articulated that the common welfare comes before  the freedom of the individual. Individual freedom is also subject to the police power of the state.
Even with prior litigation, many parents currently deny their children vaccinations by applying for “personal belief exemptions,” which are offered by California and 19 other states. These exemptions include philosophical, medical and religious reasons, among others. Though medical exemptions should remain permitted, no other exemptions should be tolerated. According to the Center for Disease Control, “use of philosophical exemptions and under immunization tend to cluster geographically, making some communities at greater risk for outbreaks.” Moreover, a geographic clustering of people without vaccinations is associated with an “increased local risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as pertussis and measles.” Ultimately, personal belief exemptions put other children at risk for preventable diseases.
Parents argue that mandatory vaccinations deny their ability to make a choice about their children’s vaccines, which violates their rights as parents. Some opponents of this bill cite faulty research that links autism to vaccines, but none of the nine CDC-funded studies since 2003 have found any link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. With rare exceptions due to medical conditions like allergies, the eight commonly administered vaccines are very safe.
Co-sponsor of the bill Democratic Sen. Richard Pan cites a recent measles outbreak in Disneyland and two whooping cough epidemics as reasons California should tighten vaccination rules. This past December the measles outbreak at Disneyland spread to 18 other states, infecting 159 people. According to state health officials, 57 of those who were infected were not vaccinated. Though this outbreak did not lead to any deaths, whooping cough epidemics in 2010 and 2014 resulted in the deaths of 10 infants.
Two leading medical institutions, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the California Medical Association, support this bill. Dr. Dean Blumberg, of UC Davis Children’s Hospital, said, “children vaccination has been so extraordinarily successful that it is easy to forget the bad outcomes.” Likewise, one of the reasons another co-sponsor of the bill, Sen. Bill Allen, signed on to the effort was because of his family history — his father had contracted polio while growing up. He recalls how he witnessed firsthand the debilitating impact of the disease and, similar to Blumberg, does not want outbreaks of long-forgotten diseases such as polio to return because of low rates of vaccination.
Ultimately, since vaccinations almost always pose no threats to one’s health, children must be required to have certain vaccinations to be allowed in school.
To the opponents — stop thinking about personal parental rights and start thinking about the safety of all children.
No. If we live in a free society, every individual has the right to choose. CA is a very diverse populated state. Nearly every culture is represented here. An epidemic of less than thousands in a population of 30 million is a rounding error, not justification for violating the rights of the majority and every minority.
Yes, Julia, but what about the important opposing arguments that 1) parents have the right to have diseased children; 2) parents have the right to spread their childrens’ diseases to others; and finally; 3) if God wanted children to be immunized, he would have given humankind modern medicine, doctors, syringes and immunization medications, yet we that all know those things don’t exist. Well – maybe they do exist, but they are the tools of sinister and hidden ruling forces, like aliens or the Illuminati, or possibly even Satan. The writer, Julia Lawler, failed these highly pertinent and probably decisive opposing arguments.

Amid the past year’s explosion of campus assault awareness, one September 2012 case stood as an emblem for the horrors of rape culture and its effect on college campuses. Now, the November 2014 Rolling Stone article vividly recounting the assault of “Jackie,” a student at the University of Virginia who used a version of her first name to remain anonymous, has been disproven on so many accounts that it seems absurd it was ever published.
On April 5, Rolling Stone published a commissioned report from the Columbia School of Journalism on its website that details the journalistic errors of the controversy. The idea was to correct its mistakes by bringing in a credible outside source. Yet, despite the magazine’s explicit insistence that it was responsible for verifying details, the public has mistaken this instance as proof that rape culture does not exist. This is not the case. Good intentions aside, the fact that the media allowed one alleged sexual assault to represent an epidemic proves that our society has a serious misunderstanding of rape culture.
As the Columbia report details, journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely reached out to rape survivor and UVA staff member Emily Renda, asking for an “emblematic college rape case” to illustrate the current climate for U.S. campuses. She hoped to demonstrate not only the prevalence of assault on college campuses but also the pervasiveness of a rape culture in which women are constantly sexualized. Renda ended up noting one prominent instance which had occurred the previous fall. Believing “Jackie” was a credible source because of her connection to Renda, Erdely proceeded to correspond with Jackie on a somewhat erratic basis.
Jackie’s detailed account seemed too intricate to be fabricated. In vivid detail, she described attending a date function at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity with a fellow university lifeguard, following her acquaintance upstairs after midnight, and thereafter falling victim to physical and sexual abuses at the hands of seven other men. After the alleged attack, Jackie reached out to three friends, only one of whom urged her to seek help. Understandably, Jackie’s story resonated with Erdely, but Erdely let her blind trust cloud her judgment. Erdely and her team moved forward, dragging many innocent students, faculty members and rape victims down with them.
The initial Rolling Stone article attracted 2.7 million views online alone and elicited absolute horror from the public. UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan suspended all Greek-life activities until January and asked the Charlottesville Police Department to conduct an investigation of Jackie’s assault. Reputation tarnished, Phi Kappa Psi suspended its UVA chapter. Feminist activists attributed to Jackie’s story the same significance Erdely hoped it would achieve. Even as gaping holes appeared in Erdely’s report, social media hashtag #IStandwithJackie appeared across the Internet.
Now that experts have disproven many details of Jackie’s assault, reactions have been volatile. An article for Slate cites writer Arielle Duhaime-Ross’s ominous prediction, “[T]he credibility of rape victims will be put into question for years to come.” This fear has surfaced in feminist sources covering the mishap, thanks to the ending of the original redaction: “[W]e have come to the conclusion that our trust in [Jackie] was misplaced.”
Despite the Columbia report blaming journalistic failure for the mishap, Rolling Stone cannot reverse the damage of these words; by apparently shifting the blame to an alleged victim, the magazine provided a weakness for anti-feminists to attack. A video featured on A Voice for Men’s website aligns Erdely with American feminism. The narrator asserts that the “credibility of real female victims is … thrown under the bus by a bunch of liberal arts degree, first-world feminists” who “see a rapist behind every tree and a rape culture on every campus.”
Jackie’s story is a reminder of the campus rape horrors. Suzannah Weiss points out that “just [2] to [8] percent of all sexual assault reports are false” and that 95 percent of college victims and 68 percent of victims overall do not report their assaults. She observes that most perpetrators do not serve jail time, even after they have been reported.
Bearing the facts in mind, we can all take a breath. Rolling Stone’s blunder does not justify arguments against feminism, nor does it end for anti-assault activism. Whether or not Jackie actually was assaulted, every incident of sexual assault is different; turning one story into an allegory for an epidemic is not the solution, but increased awareness of general statistics is a step in the right direction. Hopefully, the media will seize this opportunity to rectify its perceptions of rape culture and how the nation responds to these recent developments.
Jennifer Frazin is a sophomore majoring in English and theatre. Her column, “Not That Kind of Girl,” runs Wednesdays.
No, Jackie’s story is about a HOAX. She made up an identity for an attacker who never existed and then created an elaborate ruse to fool her friends into thinking he existed by pretending to be him and then texting them.
Repeat after me: Jackie. Was. Not. Assaulted. She is VERY lucky that the fraternity and some of her friends aren’t suing her personally.
Also, there is no epidemic of rape on campuses. There were a few at the Seven Sisters I attended in the seventies, and the stats haven’t changed since then. Ditto for other colleges.
If the author of this “column” is hoping for a career in journalism, she needs to stop being like Erdely and get rid of her pre-conceived “agenda.”
As a journalist you should be much more interested in how this nightmarish hoax came to be printed.
And you should also stop and think about the impact of what these heinous false accusations did to the young men at UVA as well as one of the deans and an assistant dean, about whom Erdely made stuff up. 
This author has got a lot of growing up to do.
Ms. Frazin, three errors in your piece:
1. When you make a statement such as “…the public has mistaken this instance as proof that rape culture does not exist,” it should be backed up by some solid evidence.  Additionally, it would be nice if you defined “rape culture,” because without a clear definition, the term can, and often is, used in many different ways and contexts (though usually for simple shock value).  
2. “…rape survivor and UVA staff member Emily Renda…”  It is unlikely that Emily Renda was a victim of rape.  There is a greater possibility she has been the victim of a sexual assault, but also evidence to suggest otherwise.  How about “Emily Renda, who also identifies as a rape survivor…” or similar.  
3. “Jackie’s detailed account seemed too intricate to be fabricated.”  While the term “rape culture” to me is mainly an issue of semantics, this statement and the widespread acceptance of the Rolling Stone article evidence the fact that we also have a “bigoted view of white males” culture.  If you could read the Rolling Stone article without a shred of doubt then you are there’s a good chance you are a bigot.  The details of the story, the lame (fabricated) quotes from Jackie’s friends were so clichéd, etc. were so over the top and clichéd that the story read like a bad after school special on campus rape.  As someone with some familiarity of college culture like that of UVA, I immediately doubted the details of the story.  The fact that many people are so ready to crucify young, white men, makes me wonder if in addition to “rape culture” our society also suffers from a “young white misandry culture.”
“the fact that the media allowed one alleged sexual assault to represent an epidemic proves that our society has a serious misunderstanding of rape culture”
As there is nothing even approaching an “epidemic” of sexual assault, particularly on campus where it occurs at a rate 20% lower than for similarly-aged non-student women, is reduced 50% from the late 1990s, and happens at a rate of only 0.61% per year (6 out of 1,000), it is also demonstrable that nothing like a “rape culture” exists in the US, except in the minds of dogmatists and activists with an agenda.
Frazen reminds us that “increased awareness of general statistics is a step in the right direction”, and yet propagates demonstrably false statistics, such as “just [2] to [8] percent of all sexual assault reports are false and 95 percent of college victims and 68 percent of victims overall do not report their assaults.”
The FBI lists as “unfounded” between 2% and 20% of rape allegations (depending on what years are included), which is four times as high as the average of other serious index crimes, but that is only for those incidents reported to the police. The actual rate of false rape allegations, we know from careful research, is as high as 50% (particularly in campus settings).
And the latest and most comprehensive study ever done on the subject, the 18-year DOJ study released in December 2014, puts the rate of campus non-reporting to the police at 80% – still quite high but hardly the 95% claimed here.
That “most [alleged – why is that qualifier always omitted?] perpetrators do not serve jail time” is that most claims of rape cannot be proved, and even among those who are convicted – according to the Innocence Project – 25% are consistently exonerated by DNA evidence, meaning they were either falsely accused or wrongly identified.
To claim at this point that “Jackie’s story is a reminder of the campus rape horrors”, is to insist that even a known fabrication can serve to advance the “cause”, that facts are irrelevant when it comes to The Big Story, and that all that matters is for people to believe the propaganda and the myth of “rape culture”.

Open Up: An order of svičková. Jordyn Holman | Daily Trojan
This weekend, my taste buds were tested in a way they had never been before. I spent three days in Prague where I promised myself that I would be more adventurous with my meal choices.
Those close to me know that I’m an extremely picky eater. I have a problem eating anything other than pastries most days.
When I started study abroad in January, I knew my diet would be in for a test. Unlike in Southern California where I can rely on Yogurtland and Chipotle to be around nearly every corner, Europe has a different type of food culture. Experiencing the different cuisine is part of my overall study abroad goal, so my trip to Prague was no different.
The first time I was in Prague four years ago, I was not as adventurous in trying the food. Instead, I relied on a large plastic bag of Rice Krispie treats that my mom had packed me to stave off my hunger. I remember nibbling on the treats at night because I had barely eaten during the day.
This time around in Prague, I was determined to eat the traditional Czech dishes. I’ve learned that food is an integral part of culture that gives you more insight into the people and history of a country. (Not exactly sure what the American hamburger says about the U.S., but it’s undeniably a part of our culture).
Traditional Czech food is very meat-based and heavy. On the first night in the city, I ordered Svičková at a local restaurant. The meal consists of either beef or chicken dosed in a plate of gravy with about five dumplings on the side. That is topped with whipped cream, smashed cranberries and a slice of lemon. It’s an interesting blend of savory and sweet — and something that I would never eat in the States. Yet I plowed my way through the meal, oddly enjoying the fact that I would only be able to eat this meal here and now.
Because it was temporal, it was tasty.
The next night I ordered a Schnitzel, something more familiar but still completely new. After each meal, my Czech friend asked how I liked it. She told me that it had been a couple of years since she had eaten the meals I was ordering. (Yes, the food was that traditional.)
Though the locals might not eat the food I tried on a day-to-day basis, I was definitely proud of myself for stepping outside my comfort zone in a way that I had never done before. It makes me excited to continue to travel because now I know the local food choices won’t be a hindrance from here on out.
