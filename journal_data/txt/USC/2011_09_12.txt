When Tamar Partamian, a junior majoring in architecture, gave a friend a tour of USC’s campus, the friend turned to her and asked, “Is this a seminary?”

It’s hard to overlook the presence of religion on campus. Walking down University Avenue, students pass the USC Hillel building and the new $35 million USC Caruso Catholic Center, currently under construction. Crossing onto Trousdale Parkway, students pass the United University Church and a quick turn onto 34th Street brings students by the University Religious Center.
What’s easy to miss, though, is just how much is going on inside these buildings. With more than 90 student religious groups, USC has the widest array of religious organizations of any American university, according to Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni.
That diversity, in part, springs from the growing number of international students attending USC; with cultural diversity comes religious diversity. But the Rev. Jim Burklo, associate dean for religious life, says the growth in religious groups on campus also represents a cultural change.
“Particularly at universities, people became more comfortable being public in their personal identities — in every way,” Burklo said. “People started being more willing to be public about it and there was more of an acceptance of differences and cultural differences.”
At the weekly meetings of the Interfaith Council, accepting cultural differences is the goal, the theme and the norm. The council, a group of about 25 to 30 students that spans religious traditions including Sikhism, Hinduism, Catholicism, Atheism and the newly coined “transpiritualism,” is focused on bringing people of different faiths together to discuss their beliefs and to learn from each other.
About one-third of the members of the Interfaith Council identifies itself as spiritual but not religious, a trend that has become more common with this generation of college students. The Office of Religious Life has tried to orient itself around this tendency toward spirituality.
“Our office is not really oriented around God, we’re oriented around meaning,” Soni said.
That means a focus on community service, rather than dogma and doctrine, and an emphasis on interfaith dialogue.
“9/11 showed us that interfaith is not a luxury but a necessity,” Soni said.
USC launched an interfaith service initiative Sunday, in conjunction with the anniversary of 9/11.
“You’re the first generation that actually will strengthen their own faith or their own beliefs by being exposed to the faith or beliefs of others,” Soni said. “It’s not threatening, it’s actually enriching and edifying.”
Jem Jebbia, a senior majoring in Japanese, business administration and religion and the president of the Interfaith Council, believes religion can be a tool for good if people of different religions understand each other. The key, she said, is for students to be willing to listen and to share.
“The biggest source of discomfort is the idea of someone trying to push their beliefs on you,” she said. “But we’re not trying to change your ideas.”
Instead, the council emphasizes discourse. Each week, it tackles a different question respectfully, talking in turn, nodding in agreement and encouraging others to share.
At last Tuesday’s Interfaith Council meeting, the question was simple: What is it like to practice your religion or spirituality as a student?
Students addressed the convenience of having friends of the same religion nearby and the availability of discussion groups like the Interfaith Council. They also mentioned the challenges of finding time to pray daily, or learning to coexist with people of very different religions — challenges that confront students of all faiths.
Layne Kaplan, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and the president of USC Hillel, said one of the biggest challenges for her group is keeping students engaged with their Jewish background. Right now, she says, Hillel only reaches about 30 percent of the Jewish students on campus.
“I think finding balance is the biggest problem,” Kaplan said. “For example, I’m in this theater class that meets every Friday for a show but every Friday is Shabbat dinner, so it’s making those sacrifices. If I miss a Shabbat dinner does that mean I don’t care about my faith? No.”
Kaplan, like other students, said a sense of community has helped her maintain her connection to her faith. For her, Hillel provides that community. For Partamian, it’s the Baha’i Student Association, even though she herself is Christian. And for Ifrah Sheikh, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, it’s the Interfaith Council.
“These people are my family,” Sheikh said.

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority broke ground Monday at the Santa Monica station for the start of construction on Phase 2 of the Expo Line, a mass-transit project that will connect Culver City to Santa Monica.

Most of the track will go along Exposition Boulevard with two stations near the USC campus, one at Exposition Boulevard and USC and one at Jefferson Boulevard and USC.
Construction began for Phase 2 of the Expo Line, although the completion of Phase 1 has been delayed because of budgetary problems and issues that arose while testing the tracks.
Phase 1 of the Expo Line, which has been under construction since 2006 and will offer service from Seventh and Figueroa Streets to Culver City, was scheduled to begin service by November 2011. The opening date has been pushed back, however, to the end of this year or the beginning of 2012, said Samantha Bricker, chief operating officer of the Expo Line Construction Authority.
With many worrying about the completion of the Expo Line, Bricker that the authority will handle Phase 2 of the construction differently than Phase 1.
“We actually have a different situation for Phase 2,” Bricker said. “We now have a fixed price contract for Phase 2 … and a different contractor … we feel very good about the contractor. They have locked in the price for construction and design.”
Bricker said Phase 2 would be completed by 2015. This came as a disappointment to many students who were looking forward to riding the Expo Line to Santa Monica and other popular locations.
“The extension will make [transportation] much easier for [students],” said Michelle Kim, a freshman majoring in political science. “I am pretty confident that students will use [the Expo Line] to explore the area and specifically the Santa Monica area.”
Upperclassmen are also disappointed because they will most likely not have the opportunity to utilize the Expo Line while attending USC.
“I feel that a lot of students are frustrated,” said Abigail Grabow, a junior majoring in occupational therapy and psychology. “Our public transportation is a bus and it takes forever, so no one goes to Santa Monica often. Having the line open would make traveling to other places easier.”
The opening of the Expo Line will allow students to easily travel to Downtown Los Angeles as well as to Santa Monica.
Students also said they want more information on the Expo Line so they can be updated on the completion of construction and locations the line will service.
LA Metro began releasing test results for the Expo Line this summer and intends to inform students about the services the Expo Line will offer when it opens, Bricker said.
“We will be informing students and working with student affairs to help spread the word,” said David Galaviz, executive director of local government relations for the university. “It will be a combination of letting students know that the trains will be tested and when Metro will open the line so that there are no false expectations.”

 is Incorect Thay Start Pre-Revinue Service Monday the 19 and that runs 5 weeks then the Line will open 
METRO Staff and Expo Line Construction Authority neet to make there statments Match
So an open date of the beginning November or even the last week of October is still a go? Is that available anywhere online to read?
There is a lot of [Expo Line] Content on Facebook and Youtube right now. Too bad my daughter graduated in 2010,
I won’t be able to use Parents Weekend as an excuse to come West to ride the Expo Line. AG (in the Article) is right, (LA) Public Transportation) is the BUS. Pretty Good System but does take a long (travel) time. GO METRO! GO EXPO!
FYI Phase 1 of the expo line will have the stops located near USC, not phase 2. When Phase 1 is about to be opened, expect a lot of media and pr work on campus to let students know it will be open.

USC senior point guard Jio Fontan will undergo surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee today, almost four weeks after he sustained the injury during USC’s pre-season exhibition trip to Brazil.
On the mend · USC senior guard Jio Fontan averaged 10.5 points per game last season. He tore his ACL during an exhibition game in August. - Daily Trojan file photo
The delay in surgery was because of extensive swelling in the knee, which needed to subside before surgeons could operate.
Fontan emerged as a dependable second scoring option to departed forward Nikola Vucevic, averaging 10.5 points per game last season and scoring a prolific 29 and 28 points in his first two games in Brazil before suffering the injury in the third game.
Fontan would apply for a medical redshirt that will enable him to return to USC for at least one more season.
USC will now start a completely new lineup, although sophomore guard Maurice Jones, relegated to sixth man status late last season, started 25 of 34 games.
Jones averaged 9.9 points and 3.3 assists per game in his first season with the Trojans.
Freshman guard Alexis Moore, from nearby Long Beach, is expected to replace Fontan in USC’s starting lineup at point guard.

The USC men’s basketball team’s recent history of NBA-level talent provided some perspective to 6-foot-8, 220-pound forward Stranhinja Gavrilovic.
On an official visit this past weekend, Gavrilovic committed to play for the Trojans for the 2012 season.
“I want to progress in basketball and play at a high level,” Gavrilovic told Scout.com. “I know USC sends a lot of players to the NBA and my goal is to one day play at the next level.”
Gavrilovic, a native of Serbia, cites former USC forward Nikola Vucevic’s recent departure as a key reason he decided on the cardinal and gold.
“Nikola Vucevic is going from Serbia to USC to the NBA, that was a big reason,” he said.
After moving to the United States earlier this year, he will play his senior season of high school at La Jolla Prep School near San Diego.
Gavrilovic is USC’s second verbal commitment of the 2012 recruiting class, joining Arizona native Larry Lewis.
—
After losing forward Marcus Simmons, center Alex Stepheson and forward Nikola Vucevic following the USC men’s basketball team’s run to the NCAA tournament last March, the Trojans are looking to rebuild with a strong 2012 recruiting class.
Landing forward Shabazz Muhammad, the nation’s top recruit in the class of 2012 according to multiple scouting services, would certainly help their cause.
Muhammad, a Las Vegas native and member of Bishop Gorman’s esteemed high school basketball program, has scheduled an official visit to USC during the weekend of Oct. 28, according to ESPNLosAngeles.com.
USC made an in-home visit with Muhammad on Friday — the first day of the NCAA-allowed contact period.
Measuring at 6-foot-6 and 215 pounds, Muhammad, has the ability, according to scouts, to step in right away and make an impact for the Trojans.
As a small forward, Muhammad is capable of knocking down a jumper or slashing to the basket. He is also regarded as one of the top defenders for his age in the country, according to scouts.
USC could potentially stand to benefit from his family connection, as Muhammad’s father, Ron Holmes, played forward for the Trojans in the 1980s.
If the Trojans are to win the services of Muhammad, they will have to top some of college basketball’s elite programs. Duke, Kansas, Kentucky, UCLA and UNLV will also be in the running come signing day.
With Muhammad scheduling an official visit to USC, it would appear the Trojans are among the star recruit’s top five schools, considering recruits are only allowed to schedule five official trips.

The 2000s were an exciting time for USC football.
An unsuspecting fan wandering into the Coliseum on any given Saturday could be blindsided by the electrifying offensive play of the Trojans. Points came a dime-a-dozen, yardage climbed to astronomical heights and sensational plays unfolded from the most basic formations.
Learning the ropes · Freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee, who has reeled in seven receptions for 66 yards in his first two games, is a young talent who can help junior quarterback Matt Barkley stretch the field vertically. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
USC seemed to be able to score touchdowns in a matter of minutes, stretching the field until the defense was rendered useless. It was not rare to see receiver Damian Williams running a 40-yard post route every third series, or Dwayne Jarrett using his speed to outpace single-coverage straight down the field. USC had offensive talent, and it wasn’t afraid to push its limits.
If that fan were to walk into the Coliseum today, chances are he or she would be significantly less impressed.
Sure, some extremely talented players have come and gone, many of whom are now enshrined in Heritage Hall (and don’t forget Reggie Bush, either). But their departure is not the reason today’s Trojans lack that same offensive explosion — USC has all but exchanged those pieces with adequate replacements.
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley was the highest ranked quarterback coming out of high school, and has been surrounded by blue-chip wide receivers and running backs since he first stepped onto the field. Almost every offensive starter has shown shades of brilliance at one point or another, testaments to their unparalleled abilities.
So what are the current Trojans missing?
A simple backing of confidence from their head coach.
After two consecutive second-half flops in which the offense traded the deep pass for a bubble screen, it has become glaringly obvious that USC coach Lane Kiffin doesn’t fully trust his players — or himself — to stretch out the field as the game drags on.
Just one look at the Trojans’ second-half drives this season and the issue presents itself: four consecutive drives of four plays or less, amounting to 31 total yards, against Utah to end the game. Against Minnesota, USC still had to punt three consecutive times to end the game while only running 20 cumulative plays in the second half.
Meanwhile, during both of these situations, the Trojans’ opponent scored to bring the game within a field goal.
That hardly seems like a good way to seal a victory late.
If this were last season, with Kiffin at the helm of USC for the first time and a 15-33 career record in college and the pros to show for his few years of experience, it would make sense to be conservative. And he certainly was last year, in his play calling and in his handling of the sanctions to the media and to fans. He didn’t want to stick out, but rather, he wanted to go about business as usual at a time when it was anything but.
But it is no longer that time. One glance at USC’s offense and it is easy to see talent all over the field.
The Trojans have a Heisman-caliber quarterback throwing to one of the best receiving corps in the nation, and have backed their talents with significant growth in maturity, focus and preparation.
So what is the holdup? With advantages this apparent, USC needs to once again start doing what brought it so much success in the recent past — airing it out.
That might be dumbing it down, but the situation really is a simple one. Exploiting the Trojans’ size, speed and physical advantage downfield will pay dividends over the course of the game.
And if Kiffin wants to continue to steadily work USC’s backfield in the mix, spreading the opponent’s secondary will only help USC’s running game by unclogging the box.
The Trojans are executing their game plan better than expected for the start of their season. The only problem is the game plan itself hasn’t held up for all four quarters.
Kiffin has put together a team that has the potential to get the program back to where it was last decade.
But in order to take the next step toward success, he will first have to shed the uncertainty preventing the Trojans from continuing to light up the scoreboard.

USC coach Lane Kiffin is arguably one of the most polarizing figures in college football. So, it’s no surprise after the Trojans home-opening win against Minnesota he received scrutiny going for two points rather than kicking the extra point.
Defending the uprights · USC junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil (center), a cornerstone player on an inexperienced offensive line, has also found a niche for himself on special teams, blocking three field goal attempts in Lane Kiffin’s first 15 games as head coach. - Daily Trojan file photo
Perhaps the most interesting facet of the recent debates regarding the merits of going for two, however, is how they have managed to detract from a veritable special teams renaissance under this new coaching regime.
And associate head coach John Baxter is at the forefront of the movement.
Since Baxter was hired, USC has devoted a significant amount of time to practice special teams.
“You do drills to help get better and to isolate areas for improvement,” said Baxter, who coached Kiffin at Fresno State. “The drills are the techniques, the techniques are the plays, the plays are the game. All the drills are there to develop the techniques.”
For a stretch, USC did not have to concern itself with improving at the margins, as the team had a stranglehold on recruiting the best Southern California high school athletes and often nabbed high profile out-of-state players as well. As the parity of the Pac-12 increases, however, and the age of powerhouse conferences draws near, special teams and the battle for field position can no longer be neglected during in-week game preparation.
“The best player plays [on special teams],” Baxter said. “It has nothing to do with what position they play on offense or defense. If they’re the best player for the [second return] position on punt return or the best player for the offensive guard on extra point, they play. What position they play on the depth chart means nothing.”
Excluding a middling 5-for-11 success rate on two-point conversion attempts during Kiffin’s tenure, there is ample statistical evidence to suggest USC’s newfound emphasis on special teams has paid enormous dividends.
One need look no further than junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil’s forearm that deflected the last-minute Utah field goal attempt Saturday.
Kalil, a projected first-round NFL draft pick this spring, has blocked two field goals this year, both of which proved to be deciding factors in each of USC’s victories.
That now brings the running total to nine blocked kicks in 15 games for Baxter’s special teams unit. Compare that to a combined eight blocked kicks from 2007 to 2009.
True to Baxter’s words, the position a player regularly plays is irrelevant, as three offensive linemen — Tyron Smith (now a rookie in the NFL) — Michael Reardon, who left the program before the season, and Kalil, have accounted for two-thirds of these blocked kicks, a specialty usually reserved for defensive pass rushers.
Therein lies Baxter’s innovation: He allots practice time to determine whose combination of wingspan, grit and athleticism is best suited to wreaking havoc on kicking teams. No regular offensive player blocked a field goal from 2006 to 2009 under former coach Pete Carroll.
Baxter’s mentality of playing the best player for the position extends to other special teams units as well. Freshman linebacker Tre Madden, originally expected to redshirt this season, played in the first two games of the season on special teams, recording two tackles.
At the beginning of training camp, there were rumblings USC might find another primary kick returner to save sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods from additional wear and tear as he is already the focal point of the USC offense.
As many as five other players have practiced at the position. However, Woods remains USC’s primary kick returner; he is simply the best option, according to Baxter.
“What’s one con [to Robert Woods returning kick-offs]?” Baxter asked. “If you’re afraid of getting injured, don’t play football. Why would you even play this game then? I don’t see anything out there that’s different from playing receiver in terms of contact.”
USC’s kicking game, which was a glaring issue last season, is already off to a positive start. Freshman kicker Andre Heidari showed he has a capable leg after connecting on a field goal from 47 yards. Heidari has range that extends beyond 50 yards, according to the coaching staff. Junior punter Kyle Negrete has also placed six of his nine punts inside the opponent’s 20-yard line.
What was a decided weakness for the Trojans these past couple of seasons might turn out to be a definitive strength.
“Negrete played a good first game — four balls inside the 20 [yard line],” Baxter said. “Heidari’s also off to a good start. Once he shows consistency in a game setting, we will probably rely on him more and more.”

Sex sells, but so does romance, comedy or anything referencing Hitler. The musical Cabaret, first staged in 1966 and immortalized onscreen in 1972, twists all of these things into a bombastic, glamorous and sinister work of theatre.

The production by the Reprise Theatre Company aims to keep the glitz of the original, but also pursues the authenticity of the historical perspective.
Set in 1930s Berlin, Cabaret follows the relationship between the flamboyant cabaret dancer Sally Bowles and American writer Cliff Bradshaw. Their unlikely romance, however, coincides with the rise of Nazi Germany.
This particular production of Cabaret was compressed into a two-week rehearsal time — a tall order for any musical production, but especially noteworthy for a show like Cabaret, which combines song, dance and theatric spectacle. An adroit director is critical for a tight turnaround. Director Marcia Milgrom Dodge, whose Broadway production of Ragtime received seven Tony nominations in 2010, was up to the challenge.
“She really did her homework and it’s made all the difference,” actor Bryce Ryness said. “We got the guns blazing really fast. We were fully blocked in for days. That doesn’t happen if a director is not prepared. She handed us a blueprint and said, ‘Ready? Go to town.’”
Ryness plays the Master of Ceremonies, the Puckish leader of the salacious Kit Kat Klub. Throughout the musical, the Emcee serves as a commentator who occasionally sashays into the story.
The award-winning actor graduated from USC in 2002 with a major in business administration, and sang in the SoCal VoCals, an on campus a capella group.
After graduating, Ryness became a professional performer. A few of his many forays include playing Roger in the RENT national tour, performing alongside Jeremy Irons in the Hollywood Bowl’s Camelot and earning a Drama Desk nomination for his performance of Woof in Hair.
The role of the Emcee has been played by greats including Joel Grey, Michael C. Hall and Alan Cumming. For this production, Ryness and Dodge hope to engender an air of authenticity.
“It’s not going to be derivative — if it is, it’s purely by accident,” Ryness said. “The intention is to be as sincere as possible in the pursuit of authenticity. [The Emcee] is really cool — he’s atypical of a musical theatre role. He [is] groundbreaking.”
Ryness will be joined by Lisa O’Hare as Sally Bowles, fresh from her performance in Gigi, and Jeff McLean as Ciff Bradshaw, following McLean’s recent performance in world premiere of Tales of the City: A New Musical. Other performers to take the stage are Mary Gordon Murray as Fräulein Schneider, Robert Picardo as Herr Schultz, and Katrina Lenk as Fräulein Kost.
Just like the Emcee’s character, Cabaret has had many interpretations, from its glitzy Broadway beginnings to a much darker and more sardonic revival. This time, Dodge plans to take the show back to its historical roots to capture the time period.
“[The tone will] ride the descent of the Kit Kat Klub into the rise of Nazi Germany,” Ryness said. “It once was this cool place to go — it had a class and glamor and some tawdry, kinky elements — yet you put on a nice outfit to go there. But as the Nazis come to power its finances [were] pulled.”
Though some might think the rhetoric before World War II is a far-gone memory, Ryness disagrees. Instead, he believes the message and tone of Cabaret are very relevant today. Though he hopes audiences enjoy a stylish show, he also hopes they will see the connection between the past and present.
“We’re living Weimar hyper-lite — in a period of extremely polarized political culture, coupled with art and a bohemian ethic among some of the population,” Ryness said.
The Reprise Theatre Company’s production of Cabaret plays at UCLA’s Freud Playhouse, Sept. 13-25. Tickets can be purchased from the UCLA Central Ticket Office by calling (310) 825-2101.

The phrase “summer reading” typically evokes one of two memories: that of forced, unwelcomed labor during otherwise free months or that of a relaxing pastime.
Either way, summer is generally regarded as an ideal time to catch up on literature, but as students know, that relatively care-free period has passed.
Whether you made it through a novel this summer, tried but failed or simply swore to never touch a book until the first day of class, casual reading is a much less desirable task now that a new semester is here.
Dense academic articles plague the syllabi of most USC students, making other forms of literature an unappealing choice to occupy free time.
But if you’re an overeager English student desiring to indulge in as much written word as possible, an engineering student fed up with equations and in need of a compelling story or somewhere in between, consider reading a memoir.
Memoirs vary greatly, from highly intellectual life-stories to Snooki’s A Shore Thing.
Though many readers might consider memoirs as part of a simplistic genre, many memoirs are simply highlighted with understandable language that’s easy to read, but still entertaining and didactic.
Here’s a list of upcoming and recently released memoirs for those looking for a relaxing, yet informative, addition to their literary education.
Each of these memoirs should provide further insight into the lives of already entertaining celebrities.
If you’re looking for a cultural education beyond a public figure’s Wikipedia page, consider picking up one of these books this semester.
No Regrets by Ace Frehley 
Ozzy Osborne’s 2011 memoir I Am Ozzy provided hilarious insight into the debauched lifestyle of the rock icon. Though Ace Frehley has often been overshadowed by his KISS bandmates such as Gene Simmons, his forthcoming memoir, No Regrets, is likely to include ridiculous stories of rockstardom similar to those from Osborne. No Regrets will also delve into the more personal relationships between the members of KISS, such as Frehley’s struggles with his fellow bandmates. Frehley was not always an active member of the band, and his memoir is likely to reveal the reasons behind the multiple disbandments.
A somewhat sad trend with rock star memoirs is they often deal with addiction. Anthony Kiedis’ Scar Tissue, the aforementioned Osborne memoir and several other autobiographies each follow this theme. Even when rock stars express regret for their past addictive actions, some still seem to project the sense that they would do it all again if given the chance. Frehley has been sober for five years, and his memoir is likely to describe his struggles with addiction. As its title suggests, however, Frehley is not ashamed of his past. Hopefully the book will offer something unique and will not follow the same formulaic path as memoirs from Frehley’s rock star peers. No Regrets is due out Nov. 1.
In My Time by Dick Cheney
Dick Cheney has been one of the most controversial public figures in recent history. Hated by many and beloved by a nearly equal amount, the former vice president has recently released his memoirIn My Time. The book is, at first glance, thick and intimidating, appearing to be along the same lines as the dull, complex writings by former members of the executive branch. In My Time, currently available, should be required reading just to find out if he mentions the quail hunting incident.
Life Itself by Roger Ebert
Roger Ebert is perhaps the most recognizable film critic in the country and has helped pioneer a certain style of criticism throughout his career. After contracting thyroid cancer and undergoing surgical complications however, Ebert was left unable to speak. As those who have ever followed the man on Twitter should know, this left Ebert desperate to find other modes of communication. His struggle for self-expression has resulted in a surge in output of written work, via both Twitter and his introspective blog posts. Admittedly, his prolific and opinionated writings have brought Ebert criticism through the years. Despite this, he still reigns as a giant in the world of film criticism. With his extended memoir available today, his fans and followers will be able to learn more about his personal life and contributions to the film industry.

They are everywhere. They are impossible to avoid. They are at every major intersection and on every television channel. What are they? Weight loss ads.
In this day and age it seems impossible to go even one hour in Los Angeles without seeing someone or something promising dramatic weight loss in less than a month.
But here’s the thing: They don’t work. Yes, they might cut weight, but they do so at the cost of overall health because of unnatural methods. Does anyone really want to put rubber bands into his or her organs or down a massive amount of unpronounceable chemicals?
With busy schedules taking hold of student life, it’s not a bad idea to consider changing one’s lifestyle to lose some weight. But instant, 30-pounds-in-two-weeks weight loss isn’t right. The tricky part of weight loss is patience.
The ideal way to lose weight is a proper balance of healthy eating, moderate exercise and plenty of sleep, but in college it’s hard to get any of those, let alone a combination — from experience, the sleep part is the hardest. So, how can one best lose weight?
The steps are a bit unique and require a leap of faith, but they work and aren’t as damaging to the body as some advertised products are. The trick? Hack your body.
The main idea is to put your body on a crash course, jolting it out of any metabolic routine. Do things to shake up how your body operates on a habitual level. Shaking things up forces the body to react, and if you shake it up long enough, the body will be put on a new, fat-burning path.
Most foods in the college lifestyle are fat building, not fat burning. Even so-called nutritious things, such as energy bars or the increasingly popular chocolate milk — although good for replenishing energy after intense exercise — are not useful for fat loss, as the high sugars and sugar-burning substances involved only stall loss, or in some cases add to fat gain. Saying “eat a balanced diet” is kind of obvious, so approach it a different way. If you can’t cut out the sugar from your diet — after all, it’s hard for some to drink coffee without any sweetener — find a way to negate its effects.
There are a few key spices that can actually block the intake of glucose to the body. A simple squeeze of lemon juice into a glass of water before a meal can cancel out the effects of sugar intake by keeping the body from absorbing it.
The same can be said for cinnamon. A dash of it is equally useful. Probably not as good with steak or something like it, but still very useful for blocking glucose.
And since quick exercise is a tool that can be used to get over weight loss plateaus, it is good to bring it in early to start the initial fat burning. The trick is to find exercises that work as much of the body with the least amount of effort. Time to exercise is limited in college, so why waste it on extraneous activities? Alternate between compound resistance exercises like deadlifts and incline bench presses, with interspersed cardiovascular exercise in the form of running. This will work the entire body with the least amount of effort.
Still too much? Try possibly one of the easiest but most overlooked solutions out there: Stand up. College students spend most of their time sitting, whether in desks in class, at home or in the car. But that only kills muscle activity and flatlines the metabolism.
The solution: Try the standing desk approach and forgo the chair, at least at home. Simply raise up your desk and work while vertical. Just like that, without any exercise, the muscles get more engagement and burn more calories.
Want a very beneficial tip for weight loss? Try cold therapy, especially in the form of cold showers after exercise. This might sound a bit uncomfortable, but in reality it can be enjoyable and has a number of benefits. Cold water increases circulation and its thermal load is greater, meaning more calories are burned in the cold water than in air. Plus, the cold stimulates certain hormones in the body that fight stress and depression, combating the weight gain brought on by hectic, busy schedules.
Weight loss isn’t impossible; it doesn’t have to entail doing something unnatural and unhealthy.
The body can be hacked.
 
Nicholas Slayton is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism.  His column “Way of the Body” runs Tuesdays.
Working standing will definitely burn more calories and even though your standing you’ll find you will move your body more. Probably best to still do some sitting, movement is what matters.
YO SLAYTON YOU’RE GONNA REGRET THAT WEIGHT LOSS WHEN I’M HACKING YOUR BODY WITH MY FISTS. GOOD LUCK USING THAT LEMON JUICE TO STAND UP TO THE LARGEST CANNONS IN TOWN AKA MY BICEPS.
WELL I’M AT IT I’LL FIGHT THIS CRAP TOO

During summer break, many of us were stuck watching repeats, while yearning for new, fresh episodes of our favorite shows. For reality TV fans, our choices were limited.
Love In The Wild wasn’t something to fall in love with. Fan-favorite Jeff left Big Brother way too early.
Hardwood star · Lakers forward Ron Artest takes his talents to other arenas, as he joins this season’s production of Dancing with the Stars, giving fans the opportunity to see another side of his notorious personality. - Photo courtesy of ABC Studios
Then there’s Jake, Vienna and Kasey who were a little too much to handle for two hours on Bachelor Pad.
There is finally hope for reality TV fans looking for some unpredictable, satisfying television.
Whether you want to watch housewives catfight, overweight Americans undergo remarkable transformations or see the return of Simon and Paula, there is something for everyone on reality TV this fall.
1. Dancing With The Stars, ABC 
Sept. 19 and 20 (two night premiere)
For season 13, ABC has assembled a wide variety of celebrities to cha-cha with professional dancers, including fan-favorite Derek Hough.
Stars ranging from Headline News host Nancy Grace, Rob Kardashian, Ron Artest, former talk show host Ricki Lake and David Arquette will be evaluated by returning judges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba.
ABC searched for higher listed celebrities, but this lot will still put on a great show.
 
2. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, BRAVO 
Now Playing
Despite the tragic suicide of Russell Armstrong, Real Housewife Taylor Armstrong’s husband, Bravo has decided to carry on with season two of the popular series.
It will be interesting to see how much producers show — with much of Taylor’s story focusing on her impending divorce from Russell.
Besides the couple’s struggles, viewers can look forward to Lisa’s quick wit and love for her dog, Jiggy. Kim and Kyle Richards will continue to work on their sister relationship.
Finally, who can forget Camille Grammer’s feud with Kyle? If the season two trailer is any indication, tensions still remain high.
 
3. The X Factor, FOX 
Sept. 21
You might be thinking, “not another singing competition.” This one, however, involves reality character favorites Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul.
The former American Idol judges reunite to critique and mentor contestants, while continuing to argue and fight with each other.
The show will feature singers in groups or solo acts aged 12 and up. Auditions were held at USC’s Galen Center last spring, and the final winner will receive a $5 million recording contract.
 
4. The Biggest Loser, NBC
 Sept. 20
Jillian Michaels leaving The Biggest Loser to start a family was disappointing to many loyal fans. Who else could yell at contestants one minute and make them weep with tears of joy the next?
This season the weight-loss show introduces new trainers Anna Kournikova and Dolvett Quince who join Bob Harper to train 15 overweight contestants. This season’s theme will be “Battle of the Ages,” which will group contestants to battle it out by age.
Later in the season, look out for NFL greats Eric Dickerson, Drew Brees and Tim Tebow.
 
5. Kim Kardashian’s Fairytale Wedding, E! 
Oct. 9 and 10
We’ve seen the wedding photos in People Magazine and have met Kris Humphries on Keeping Up With the Kardashians during the family’s Bora-Bora trip. Now, we can enjoy one of America’s biggest weddings of the year in a two-part, four-hour special airing on E!
The special will follow the bride and groom’s big day: everything from Kim’s three wedding dresses, the guest list which includes Kathie Lee Gifford, Eva Longoria, Mario Lopez and Lindsay Lohan, to the $10,000, 6-foot tall cake.
If it’s anything like Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom’s TV wedding, we have a lot to look forward to.
 
6. H8r, CW 
Sept. 14
In the CW’s latest reality show, celebrities including Snooki and Kim Kardashian face their biggest enemies, or in other words, the judgmental American public–hater.
The show, hosted by Mario Lopez, will follow a celebrity who must spend time with an ordinary American who cannot stand him or her in hopes of better understanding one another. In the end, some of the pairs will end up friends while others will remain haters.

As a non-native Angeleno, I believe that the most misleading of all Southern California stereotypes is the phrase “the rolling hills of Southern California,” at least insofar as it applies to USC.
It was a relieving discovery, as an incoming freshman in fall 2008, that  such a description was better applied to the campus across town. Being a student in a wheelchair at USC has been relatively pleasant; I was welcomed by a predominantly flat campus, with many handicap-accessible ramps.
The seas of bikes outside Leavey Library and the Lyon Center, however, have posed a problem in my  stay here. Usage of the  wheelchair ramp occurs sparingly, which creates a sort of “out of sight, out of mind” scenario.
The easiest solution is to stress that regardless of how often it gets used, it is a wheelchair access ramp first and foremost.
USC should install more bike spaces so the wheelchair accessibility ramps are not blocked. Moreover, campus security could help alleviate such issues by being more vigilant about where and when students park their bikes.
Occasionally, students have been desperate enough to lock their bikes to the inside of the handicap ramp — this is understandable. There comes a time in the day when there just isn’t any more space left to park a bike. Locking bikes to the inside of the ramp, however, makes it nearly impossible to reach the other ramp, even if you wanted to.
This clearly poses a problem to people that need to use said ramps. Though wheelchair accessibility hasn’t been a major issue in most places around campus, the hotbed of foot traffic and, in turn, bike traffic around Leavey Library and the Lyon Center  threatens accessibility.
Along with a joint effort from students, these problems could be solved. If students can be more aware  of those in wheelchairs, they could potentially augment said issues rather quickly. Yes, it is rare to see a wheelchair on campus. I can assure you, though, we are here, we are nice and we promise not to knock your bikes over.

Too many bikes…..
I agree. Perfect tone, Nick. And I promise to keep a lookout for such offenders and bring it to their attention.
This is a great op-ed; clear, to-the-point, engagingly written and on an important topic. Thank you, Nick! DT, let’s see more of this.

Partially in response to President Barack Obama’s challenge issued in March to bridge religious divides and build understanding while giving university students a chance to participate in community service projects, USC hosted an interfaith memorial on Sept. 11, commemorating the 10th anniversary of that fateful day.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Calling the event “interfaith,” though, doesn’t really say anything more than naming the initiative  “secular.” Interfaith is a term that should be avoided because it downplays uniqueness between various religions and faiths. It creates a contrived atmosphere, one driven by the politically correct world in which we live.
By trying to encompass all faiths, the term interfaith loses any distinction between people.
Instead, the term asks for the distinction between “religious” and “non-religious” people. Either way, its use causes people to call every way of life a “faith.” Thus, the term doesn’t carry any more meaning than refraining from denoting a religious connotation at all. Its use suggests that people should make judgments regarding what is and isn’t a religion.
This doesn’t seem to be consistent with the principles of interfaith organizations.
USC is trying to promote understanding and truth seeking among diverse groups of people. This is an admirable goal. This is also the unifying force among those who consider themselves religious.
But this can also be the unifying goal of any type of secular endeavor. Interfaith organizations that fail to define what describes a “faith,” in an effort to be all-encompassing or politically correct, really don’t say anything beyond wanting to include everyone.
A very broad range of people, including those who consider themselves “religious,” can claim solidarity in that they are seeking to understand the true nature of the universe.
This definition, though, challenges the colloquially used definition of what a “religion” even is, as doing math homework is as much of a search for truth as visiting a holy site or studying a sacred text.
That being said, the term religious can either encompass everybody, or must be distinguished, with criteria such as “the belief in a god” or something similar. Of course, this would be horribly politically incorrect. The safer option then would be to abandon such terms outright.
Rather than creating organizations vaguely named as “interfaith,” organizations that are going to distinguish themselves as religious should have something easily identifiable to unite behind. Christians, Muslims and Jews, for example, can create an organization recognizing a shared belief in a single God described in some shared texts.
This would differ from efforts to look at perceived shared values among a diverse range of religions. Looking at these shared values is to overlook the differing underlying principles behind each faith. If USC wishes to promote understanding among people of different faiths, it should not do so by asking students to only look at the surface aspects of different religions, or by pushing ideology contrary to the principles of many of the faiths it is trying to recognize by insinuating that all religions are the same.
It is clear that interfaith initiatives seek to recognize and discuss diversity.
But it is also clear that these same initiatives seek to promote unity.
Unity, as traditionally expressed in individual religions, is only possible with exclusivity.
For example, Muslims at the Kaaba participate in the same acts of worship to emphasize solidarity. Certain denominations of Christianity permit only those who have been baptized as Christians to partake in the Holy Communion. Varna in Hinduism divides society into distinct castes, each excluding the others.
Identification involves both negation and affirmation — one must say what one is and what one isn’t. Calling a group “interfaith,” considering the elusive definition of what it means to be religious, then, does not really say anything at all.
It excludes those that aren’t part of a “faith,” or suggests that everybody is part of a “faith” of some sort. Of course, saying that “interfaith” encompasses everyone would make such a group’s distinction as “religious” rather meaningless.

All I read was the ramblings of a pompous, pretentious twat. He make a valid point, but the argument – or rather lack thereof – was pathetic. Someone please re-teach this guy how to write. Thanks.

“Spartacus: Blood and Sand” star Andy Whitfield passed away this Sunday at the age of 39. He died in Sydney, Australia due to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Andy Whitfield is survived by his two children and his wife Vashti, who held him as he died in her arms after 18 months of struggling with the cancer. Chief executive of Starz Chris Albrecht, said in a statement, “The man who played a champion on-screen was also a champion in his own life.”
Whitfield’s Spartacus co-star Lucy Lawless also praised Andy Whitfield in Entertainment Weekly saying, “Andy’s incandescent film presence made men want to be him and women want to marry him. Andy’s two babies will always know that their Daddy cherished them and their mother, Vashti, above all things. How lucky we were to have him grace all our lives. Godspeed, Andy!”
The actor came to fame when he was chosen as the leading gladiator in the blood-soaked and sex-driven Starz Entertainment show. His performance was so strong production of a second season was halted a year and a half ago when Whitfield was first diagnosed with the cancer.
During that time, producers created “Spartacus: Gods of the Arena,” a prequel series with different actors. However, Whitfield was never able to recover for a second season, so rather than cancel, producers recast is role. With Whitfield’s blessings, Liam McIntyre has taken over in Spartacus as the leading Thracian gladiator in a slave rebellion. “Spartacus: Vengeance” is set to premier on Starz in January.

The White House plans to release a new online petition initiative called “We the People,” a new way for citizens to make their voices heard. According to the White House press release, any petition receiving more than 5,000 signatures within the 30-day allotted time period will be officially reviewed; the Obama Administration will then issue a formal response to the proposal.
Although there is no guarantee that any given politically charged movement will elicit an actual policy change from our nation’s lawmakers, this initiative is a simple and inexpensive way to show the citizens of America that we can participate.
“We the People” has the potential to fuel popular grassroots movements that would have otherwise had to resort to putting up flyers at the local mall. With this new system, any movement that can secure a meager 5,000 signatures in a month will be granted immediate national recognition.
Even if the Obama Administration does not even entertain the notion of starting a formal policy change in support of the petition, at least the petitioners will receive a full response from the White House as to why their petition can’t be turned into law. This assurance, coupled with the newly earned attention of the nation, might be enough to give the movement future success.
According to the rules of “We the People,” anyone over the age of 13 is eligible to register their petition to the White House. Rather than restrict the process to adults, this low age limitation will give interested youth an easy avenue toward political action. This might serve to reduce the political apathy we see plaguing much of the late teenage demographic.
The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees our right to petition the government at our discretion; this new White House initiative opens up a new avenue for grassroots movements to reach fruition.

Entourage’s series finale was at once surprising and predictable. The HBO series followed four friends —Vince, Eric, Johnny and Turtle — along with Vince’s big shot Hollywood agent, Ari Gold.
Vince’s character has long been marked by his sweet yet playboy-like persona, while Ari was known as Vince’s perverse but likeable agent. The finale warps the two men into characters nearly unrecognizable to fans.
Vince decides to marry Sophia, a British journalist who originally rejected him because she refused to date actors, after just one date. Ari’s vulnerable, sentimental side is brutally exposed for the first time as he is forced to choose between his career and his marriage. Vince’s abrupt decision to get married and Ari’s decision to quit his job to save his marriage are highly uncharacteristic of each man.
Vince’s best friend and manager, Eric Murphy, was also a focus of the finale. Many episodes leading up to the finale had Eric struggling to win back his now-pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sloan. Eric does not talk to Sloan the entire episode, and viewers are supposed to believe that Vince, Johnny and Turtle convinced her to take him back.
As usual, Johnny and Turtle took a back seat to their buddies. Their less-than-significant roles seemed to be the only thing in the finale typical of an Entourage episode.
Just when you think the episode is over and the credits role, Ari and Mrs. Ari are shown in Florence, Italy. Ari gets a phone call from a studio head who offers Ari his job as CEO and Chairman of a major Hollywood studio. The series ends with viewers wondering whether Ari will take the job, or live in Florence for a year like he promised his wife.
The idea that love will always prevail was definitely the theme of the Entourage series finale. Although dedicated followers were probably hoping for a happy ending, the improbable decisions of the show’s favorite characters might not have been the most favorable way to end the series.
Very insightful review. Your absolutely right. The final episode was a joke that made a mockery of all the past seasons. Vince would never get married after one successful date even if the woman was unique and challenged him in ways other women hadn’t before. I am sad the show has come to a screeching halt. It would have been great to see where “the boys” could have gone. The show will be missed!

A bill that delays requiring online retailers such as Amazon to charge California sales tax for one year will go to Gov. Jerry Brown’s desk for his signature after the legislature passed it on Friday.
Without AB 155 — also known as the “compromise bill” or the “Amazon deal” — stopping the collection of sales tax, California would have earned $200 million in tax revenue. The new bill states that online retailers have until September 2012 before starting to collect the state’s nearly 10 percent tax from its customers.
“This legislation will allow us to continue to work with Congress and the states to obtain a federal resolution to the sales tax issue as soon as possible,” Amazon’s vice-president of global public policy, Paul Misener, told the Register.
Any national law enacted before next September would supersede California’s current deal with Amazon.
The sales tax collection by online retailers with a physical presence in California was set to go into effect this past July after legislation from Sacramento, but Amazon created a petition in the hopes that voters would overturn the new law.
In exchange for a deal, Amazon has offered to create more jobs in California by building new distribution centers. The current AB 155 has no such measures yet.
