The baseball team hopes that its mid-week slip against Pepperdine will not derail the team from making an impact during the Pac-12 season. USC is set to travel to Eugene to meet a 14-12 Oregon team whose bats have recently come alive taking two of three games from No. 9 Cal.
Though Oregon head coach George Horton is known across the country as the coach who plays “small ball” on offense — a term that typically refers to an emphasis of getting runners on base and sacrificing batters to move that runner into scoring position and across the plate. Oregon culminated the weekend series with 15 hits in a 11-5 win Sunday to improve to a 4-5 record during conference play.
USC head coach Dan Hubbs says that Oregon will have to prove that they can hit the ball to score in order to defeat the Trojans, but he warns that this emergence of offense could be especially troubling when paired with Oregon’s trio of left-handed pitchers Cole Irvin, David Peterson and Matt Krook that he has been preparing his team for already in practice. Before Sunday’s game, the Ducks were batting .207 as a team, but they went 15-for-34 (.441,) Sunday against Cal, according to the Register Guard.
“Eugene is notoriously a tough place to score, so we are going to have to be able to execute,” Hubbs said. “When we get a lead-off double, we are going to have to drive that guy home. We are not just going to be able to give them opportunities to score without them having to hit to score.”
Despite noting that USC displayed an impressive hitting performance in their series win over Utah, Hubbs says that the offense seemed to be in a bit of “a lapse” against Pepperdine Tuesday. After winning the first two series games against Utah, the Trojans could not overcome a rocky performance from senior pitcher Kyle Davis who struggled immensely through two and one-third innings in the series finale, allowing five runs on six hits and eventually losing the game 14-8.
Senior outfielder and first baseman AJ Ramirez earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors for batting .538 (7-for-13) with five RBIs and two home runs in a week when USC went 3-1. Ramirez contributed one hit or more in each of those games.
USC travels to Eugene after coming off of 3-2 loss at Pepperdine Tuesday in which Hubbs labeled his team’s performance as “vanilla,” because there was neither “nothing great” nor “nothing awful” about their execution. Due to their mediocre record (15-16), Hubbs acknowledges that every loss is now amplified for the Trojans.
“Every game from now on is important, and we have got to win as many of them as we can,” Hubbs said. “Every loss gets magnified because you did not play well earlier in the season.”
Hubbs credits his two freshmen, pitcher CJ Stubbs and first baseman Dillon Paulson, for their impact on the game Tuesday. He noted that Stubbs pitched significantly better than he had in the previous week, hurling seven strikeouts through four innings against the Waves.
Hubbs was particularly impressed with Paulson who had two hits in his two at bats and was instrumental in the Trojans’ 2 runs. In the fifth inning, Paulson had been walked and utilized a wild throw from reliever Jonathan Pendergast to advance to second, a bunt from redshirt junior shortstop Reggie Southall to get to third and an infield hit from redshirt sophomore second baseman Frankie Rios who grounded into a double play, but did give the base runner the distraction he needed to eventually cross home plate for USC’s first run of the game.
Paulson contributed a second time in the seventh inning when leading off with a double before being substituted out of the game for pinch runner redshirt junior Turner Clouse, who scored thanks to another timely bunt from Southall that allowed him to take third base before a sacrifice fly from Rios brought him home.
Though batters continued to strand runners on base and in scoring position after giving up the game-winning run in the bottom-seventh inning and eventually losing 3-2, Hubbs expects the team to improve against Oregon because he anticipates them to play with a greater “sense of urgency” in their fourth inter-conference series.
First pitch of USC’s three-day weekend series against Oregon is at 6 p.m. Friday in Eugene. Saturday and Sunday’s game start at 2 p.m. and 12 p.m., respectively.

USC’s Zeta Phi Rho fraternity attempted to beat the world record for the most sandwiches made in one minute for its 14th annual Zeta Phi ‘Skid’ Rho event Thursday in McCarthy Quad.
The goal of the event is to make sandwiches that are then donated to the homeless living on Los Angeles’ Skid Row. Eric Liang, philanthropy chair at Zeta Phi Rho, supports his brothers’ development of leadership and teamwork through serving the community with events like “Skid” Rho.
“The idea [for “Skid” Rho] came from brothers wanting to solve the homeless problem in Los Angeles by feeding them and spreading awareness of various ongoing issues,” Liang said.
Zeta Phi Rho previously broke the world record for making the most sandwiches in one hour at the 12th Annual Zeta Phi “Skid” Rho at USC by making 17,341 sandwiches in 2014.
Immediately after the event, the sandwiches were delivered to Union Rescue Mission on Skid Row. Liang estimated that they made around 400 sandwiches per minute, short of the 700-per-minute sandwich goal.
“We didn’t beat the record unfortunately.” Liang said.
Several participants donning plastic gloves gathered at McCarthy Quad to assemble sandwiches and partake in attempting to beat the world record. A handful of students from other schools, including members from Zeta Phi Rho’s UCLA chapter, also attended to help attempt to set the world record at USC.
Thursday’s event began with several sandwich-making games that prepped participants for breaking the record. Brothers from Zeta Phi Rho informed participants about the event’s purpose and the target sandwich number they needed to beat.
During the event, participants split up into tables and teams to start the sandwich-making process. The participants constantly bumped arms with each other in an effort to accelerate their sandwich production.
Most groups split up the work putting peanut butter and jelly on the sandwich and opening the jars and packages in a bid to fill any vacant space. Other teams had more efficient ways at getting the job done.
In addition, retailers such as  7-Eleven, ONO Hawaiian BBQ, Coca Cola and Frito-Lay sponsored the event, supplying the event with snacks, gift cards and prizes to ensure that the participants were full of energy and motivation to participate and assemble sandwiches.
After the event, Zeta Phi Rho encouraged participants to sign a petition to improve mental health facilities in downtown Los Angeles. With the signatures from the petition, Zeta Phi Rho plans on drafting a deliverable that will be addressed to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to request for more of the city’s budget to be allocated to mental health facilities.
“We want Trojans to read more about the link between mental health and homelessness and to reach out to the L.A. governor to express their voice,” Liang said.

Nearly 2,200 students, teachers and parents from across 28 schools attended the USC Viterbi Robotics Open House, an annual event sponsored by the Center for Robotics and Embedded Systems. Robotics researchers from the Viterbi School of Engineering made a comprehensive exhibition of all the research activities that are in progress at Viterbi.
The principle organizers of the event were Maja Mataric, vice dean of research, and Katie Mills, outreach administrator for Viterbi.
The event is part of the ongoing outreach efforts of Viterbi Adopt-a-School, Adopt-a-Teacher program, which aims to motivate the next generation of engineers with the creativity and possibilities of science, technology, engineering, math and machines.
“USC has a relationship with a number of schools that are part of what is called as the ‘USC Family of Schools,’” said Michelle Flowers Taylor, director of the Institute of Engineering Community and Cultural Competence. “We have this ongoing relationship with schools in the area, and we engage the students and their teachers in various on-campus activities in our schools to help really provide an exposure to the students to engineering and computer science.”
Graduate and postdoctoral students talked about what robotics is and how they first became interested in engineering, in addition to showing them application specific robots that they have developed. One example is Scribbler, a bot designed and programmed by Colin Quinsey, a biomedical engineer, that autonomously finds its way through a maze drawn in black ink on paper. Quinsey, talked about assembling sensors and actuators in a sized chassis which act as the eyes, ears and limbs of the robot.
“A lot of our projects are open ended,” Quinsey said. “We don’t have instruction based projects, rather this is a task that you have to do and you have to solve it in whatever manner you can”.
The USC VexU Robotics team, a multidisciplinary mechatronics design team and a finalist in the 2016 Vex World Competition for the design, fabrication and programming of its custom built robots, also put up a display.
Students were also shown the possibilities of controlling robots through brainwaves. Ali Marjaninejad, a doctoral candidate in biomedical engineering and Chris Lynn, a postdoctoral  student in brain body dynamics, talked about their “Modellers” research which has been ongoing in collaboration with the Caltech David Andersen Lab. The research goes a long way to help patients with disabilities mimic the abilities of a normal person with mechanical prosthetic. Marjaninejad and Lynn explained how electrodes arranged on the brain surface of a subject carried signals to the robot controller which acted to the accord of the user.
“I’m studying the physiology of movement and muscle control, particularly manual dexterity,” Lynn said. “We are doing this to learn not only how dexterity is possible, but also using small hand manipulation tasks in order to quantify and characterize disease states.”
Zhi Su, a biomedical engineer, put up a display of robotic arm which could drive a screw into a machine.
“The way my project works is actually very intuitive,” Su said. “Robots have a memory of their previous experience with one form of objects and then use the experience to do other forms of different objects.”

H.E.A.L., USC Hillel, Residential Student Government and Residential Education sponsored a Self-Care fair for the first time in Alumni Park Thursday to make wellness more accessible for the student body. Over 25 campus organizations participated and brought their own answers to the question, “What does wellness mean to you?”
Ashley Seruya, the student coordinator of the Self-Care fair, said she wanted to bring in a wellness initiative on campus for students.
“I am a senior, and I’ve had mental issues myself that I had to deal with,” Seruya said. “I know that USC does have a health program; we got the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion and the Engemann [Student Health] Center. The University is doing a lot to make health a priority. But it is still very difficult to access them on a day-to-day basis and to know where to go.”
In an attempt to educate students about maintenance and self-care and to promote in the community a feeling of wellness on campus, Seruya reached out to Hillel, RSG and Residential Education to help. According to Seruya, Hillel has already received a grant and was looking for social work students to take over and to promote programs centering on wellness on campus.
“My idea is that H.E.A.L. with Hillel is going to be an umbrella program for wellness initiatives on campus,” Seruya said.
The self-care fair was followed up by H.E.A.L. with Hillel’s L’Briyut: Health and Wellness Art Expo and Open Mic from 7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.
Students reacted positively to the fair as they shared their ideas of wellness. Ryan Covington, a junior majoring in real estate development, spoke about what wellness means to him. According to Covington, wellness allows him to be the best version of himself.
“Wellness means everything to me. I grew up as a swimmer, and taking care of my body has been my number one priority,” Covington said. “I try to extend this message to people because there are so many things going on in our days and it is hard to combat that. So when you have that personal time, you can feed yourself, work out and take care of your overall body — this allows you to combat anything that comes your way.”
During the fair, students were encouraged to visit as many booths as possible. They were given stamp cards; students with five stamps received free healthy snacks from Amazebowls and Urban Espresso, and students with 10 stamps were entered in a raffle to win a basket of wellness goodies.
Amy Zhao, a junior majoring in global health and occupational science, participated in the fair as a representative of Alzheimer’s Greater Los Angeles. She shared the best moments at the fair.
“It is really cool to tell people about the myths and the facts about Alzheimer’s and how wellness is so important even in college,” Zhao said. “This fair has been great. This covers so many aspects of wellness, and people seem to be really enjoying all the activities out here.”
Zhao said wellness has the potential to improve people’s lifestyles.
“I think about health and wellness in occupational therapy perspective, which is that you don’t have to be physically well to have wellness,” Zhao said. “It is the idea that you are in control of your own choices and your own happiness.”

Newly hired athletic director Lynn Swann was formally introduced during a press conference at the McKay Center Thursday morning.
Swann, who spoke after brief remarks from President C. L. Max Nikias, admitted this was not an opportunity he expected to undertake.
“It’s a privilege for me to be here,” Swann said. “It’s an honor certainly to be back at my alma mater as the incoming athletic director. There are a lot of things in my life that I think I planned for — this was not necessarily one of them. But it’s one of those great unexpected outcomes I think that I’m looking forward to, and I think I’ve been building for a long period of time.”
Swann is well known in the USC community, starring in the football program in the 1970s en route to a Hall-of-Fame NFL career. After retiring from the game, Swann spent time in broadcasting, business and politics.
The 64-year-old, who has a degree in public relations from USC, noted one of his objectives was to help student-athletes pursue successful careers after their playing days are done, citing his own experience.
“If they’re fortunate enough to be able to play at a professional level, that’s great,” Swann said. “But you know the odds of that are very small. To get that education and find the other avenues they can move into, and have the tools and skills to move on is what we’re trying to accomplish here.”
The mindset was apparent in the three goals he laid out for the athletics program: to graduate, win and experience. Swann praised Pat Haden, whom he will replace in July, for increasing student-athlete graduation rates during his tenure.
Regarding athletics, Swann spoke to the need to compete at a national level.
“You practice, you play, you work to be No. 1, not to be No. 2 or 3,” Swann said. “If you’re working to be No. 1, you’re going to get the most out of yourself and the most out of your program. Anybody who’s working to be less than No. 1 is going to get less than what they’re capable of, so we will push these teams to be national champions and to be the best that they can be.”
Finally, Swann noted the importance of education beyond the classroom and the large international presence at USC as a tool to gain experiences.
“The ultimate goal is to make sure we take care of the kids, to give them an environment that nurtures them, protects them and gives them an opportunity to be open and free, to discuss ideas and to grow,” Swann said.
Swann said he did not explicitly seek the position, but received encouragements from friends and on Twitter. When Nikias approached him, he thought it through and decided to pursue it.
“I’m not coming into this job thinking I have all the answers,” Swann said. “I’m coming here to work with an established team that has done a great job. I will learn from them. I will find out how we can do things better as we move forward. I will take suggestions on how to do it. I will be very inclusive as we move forward.”
Swann, who was named to the position on Wednesday, beat out more than 200 candidates in a search that Nikias called “exhaustive.”
“Going through this process, I knew this would be one of the biggest decisions that I would make as president,” Nikias said. “From the beginning when we announced the search, I have constantly been restless. Once I made the decision, I’ve been at peace with myself.”
Nikias revealed there were seven “serious” finalists for the position, which included sitting athletic directors from other programs and NFL executives. Nikias made the decision with consultation from a search firm, but without help from Haden and the Board of Trustees. Haden, who will step down in June, was noticeably absent during the press conference.
Though Swann has no prior experience in athletic administration, Nikias was not concerned.
“When I look at leadership positions … I am looking for the person that has leadership qualities,” Nikias said. “I’m a very strong believer that the best training for leadership is leadership itself.”
Swann is also the third consecutive former football player to be named to the post and his connections to USC were of note to Nikias.
“I wanted to find the person with the right leadership qualities and general knowledge of intercollegiate athletics or athletics in general — which he does,” Nikias said. “But the fact then that he’s a Trojan legend, my god, that’s a big value added.
Swann will look to continue to stabilize the athletics program and continue its legacy.
“USC’s standard is to win national championships,” Swann said. “That’s exactly what we’re going to do: Win national championships.”

When Pat Haden announced in February that he would be stepping down as USC athletic director in June, University President C. L. Max Nikias wrote in a letter to the Trojan Family that the search for Haden’s replacement would be “national in scope.”
For all we know, it might have been. Nikias, with the help of a search firm, considered more than 200 candidates for the position, a pool that he described as “diverse” and “highly qualified.”
But by hiring Lynn Swann, a former football star at USC with no prior experience in athletic administration, Nikias failed to prove the candidate he picked fit either category.
Rather, Nikias reaffirmed the significance of the “Trojan Family,” a concept that may be important for a sense of unity among students or a lasting bond for alumni, but should not be a priority for hiring an athletic director.
It has been more than 30 years since USC last hired an athletic director from outside the University: Mike McGee in 1984. Alumni complained that McGee wasn’t part of the “Trojan Family,” and McGee left in 1993 to take the same post at South Carolina.
Since then, the Trojans have exclusively stuck to their own. Mike Garrett, who replaced McGee, was the school’s first Heisman Trophy winner. Haden, too, was a beloved ex-football player hired in 2010 to succeed Garrett.
They both have similar backgrounds: cherished former football stars with strong careers outside of the sport, but no experience as athletic director. And it’s fair to say both their tenures were rather tumultuous.
Garrett’s lone bright spot was hiring former football head coach Pete Carroll in 2000, and that could be chocked up to just blind luck. His hiring tendencies were described by a Seattle Times writer as “random, whimsical, at times reckless and at worst, ill-considered.” His lack of control over the program contributed to the heavy sanctions handed down to both the football and basketball teams during his tenure, which ended in 2011, but not before one final reckless hire in former football head coach Lane Kiffin.
He left Haden with a mess, and while USC recovered from the sanctions, it was still treated to controversy after controversy, from Haden axing Kiffin on an airport tarmac to the debacle that was the firing of Steve Sarkisian.
And now we turn to Swann, who has eerily similar credentials to his two predecessors. He was treasured as a player. After his football career was over, he dabbled in a wide array of fields that included broadcasting, business and politics. He ran for governor of Pennsylvania. He has served on the board of several successful companies. Swann is a smart, distinguished man who has been many things — just not an athletic director.
The University’s decision begs a simple question: Should a newly hired athletic director at a primetime program such as USC have experience, you know, as an athletic director?
Time and time again, the answer has been a resounding “no,” and it remains baffling. Considering the size and power of USC Athletics, there are undoubtedly hundreds of successful, experienced athletic directors at other programs around the country who would jump at the chance to take charge at a Division I powerhouse.
Greg Byrne at Arizona, Jim Phillips at Northwestern and Bernard Muir at Stanford were three names from outside USC that surfaced this go-around, and it’s probable that they were among the 200 names that Nikias considered. Yet, he ultimately decided that a man with no athletic administrative experience whatsoever was better suited to handle the many rigors of heading 21 Division I sports than the many established candidates with a proven track record.
Nikias was asked about Swann’s lack of experience following the introductory press conference on Thursday.
“That wasn’t a concern to me at all,” Nikias said. “When I look at leadership positions … I am looking for the person that has the leadership qualities, the trait of leadership. I am a believer that the best training for leadership is leadership itself.”
Fair enough, but “leadership” is a broad trait. Garrett and Haden certainly possessed leadership, but lacked the specific qualities to succeed in a demanding role.
After Helton was promoted to full-time head coach of the football team last November, a Yahoo! Sports columnist dubbed USC the “University of Self Congratulation.” Indeed, the University could have waited literally two more games — both of which Helton lost — before the season ended and they could have their pick from a wide array of high-octane candidates. But as soon as they saw an opportunity to reward one of their own, they did not hesitate, quickly dubbing Helton — a man with no previous head coaching experience — as the solution to getting the football program back to national prominence.
And how does Nikias feel about Swann’s USC pedigree?
“The fact that he’s a Trojan legend — my God — that’s a big value added,” he said.
This “self congratulation” concept has carried on for decades and lives on with Wednesday’s hiring of Swann. It shows that the University is more interested in gratifying old friends than building a successful athletics program.
It is entirely possible that I could be wrong; that Swann, unlike Haden and Garrett, could end up being the perfect fit and turn USC into the West Coast capital of collegiate athletics. For now, though, we can only judge by what’s been put in front of us — the same story, over and over again that Nikias is just asking to be repeated a third time. The University’s lack of willingness to sway from the familiar, to concede that someone from outside the Trojan Family could bring a much-needed fresh perspective proves that USC is too busy living in the past to look toward the future.

I felt the same way about Nikias, the consummate insider who, by exploding the size of the undergraduate student body to just under 20,000 (with no cap in sight), is transforming USC into a private version of a mega-public university.
Yeah, Nikias is diluting SC. He’s trying to make SC be everything to everyone. Public schools do that, not private schools. You can see it by the proliferation of all the over-the-top liberal sentiment and activism; SC wasn’t like this 5 years ago. I’m afraid that SC will be a me-too university as long as Nikias is in charge.
I’m a USC alumnus (LAS in the 80s when USC was much smaller) and many of us are angry with what we see as an administration intent on turning USC into a public school.  Nikias’ problem is that he comes from a public system (SUNY Buffalo) and erroneously believes USC is a land grant university, WHICH IT IS NOT AND NEVER WAS.  He should go, IMO, and USC needs a prez who graduated from the college or an outsider who appreciates private education in the context of a smaller and more personal student body. 
I, too, am an alumnus (LAS in the ’80s) and I see things very differently.  USC is no longer “University of Second Choice” as it was back then.  Now, thousands clamor to gain entrance to USC as their first choice.  The university and many of its schools are ranked higher, and in some case much higher, than they were back in the ’80s.  Believe it or not, there are enrollment caps in place even as the acceptance rate goes down every year.  This is not a glass that is half full or half empty; it’s overflowing.  President Nikias and his predecessor are the ones who had the foresight to take USC to new heights.  Fight on!
I respectfully disagree.  USC was a great school then as it is today, thanks to the foresight of Presidents Hubbard and Zumberge and countless USC alumni and supporters.  USC was a better place then in terms of a much smaller student body and the personal interaction only a private college can provide.  Today USC is too large and consequently will be shut out of the “pantheon” of elite universities if it maintains its present public school size.  It’s time for a fresh start in the president’s office and USC needs a private school-focused leader.
“That wasn’t a concern to me at all,” Nikias said. “When I look at leadership positions … I am looking for the person that has the leadership qualities, the trait of leadership. I am a believer that the best training for leadership is leadership itself.” -This is talking in circles. It makes no sense to me, and lacks substance.
“Promoting from within” isn’t always the best thing to do. It’s better to hire those from the outside, with a different perspective. Pete Carroll was an outsider…

Congratulations again to Donald Trump, who has once more successfully received the negative national attention his campaign so clearly craves. Earlier this week, UC San Diego became the latest scene in a string of pro-Trump chalkings, in which racially motivated and hateful messages could be found on university grounds — most recently (and unsurprisingly) in front of the Raza Resource Centro, a resource center for Latinx and Chicanx  students.
The perpetrators were probably, like many of the chalkings themselves, white, and also like the chalkings, unintelligent and painfully unoriginal. UCSD is the second campus in the past month to see this type of vandalism.
But the underlying cause goes back much further than that. Back all the way to early American history: The year was 1676, and the event was Bacon’s Rebellion. Poor, white frontiersmen were threatened by constant Native American attacks. Dissatisfied with the landed gentry’s dismissal of their safety concerns, poor whites allied with the gentry’s black slaves to rise up against the wealthy elite. After the insurrection was put down, the Southern upper class disseminated messages of racist hatred to the white lower classes — they might be poor, but at least they weren’t black. It was intended to prevent the alliance of poor whites with poor blacks in fear that they would overpower rich whites. The lower class ate up the message of God-given, inherent superiority, and a critical piece of American racism was born.  Trump has mobilized the white working class in exactly the same manner — except his target is not the black community. It is the Hispanic one.
Dissatisfied by unemployment, poverty and a lack of educational opportunity — all self-fulfilling prophecies, really, when any community of the working class votes red — Trump used that betrayal of the political elite to cultivate a vitriol the likes of which we haven’t seen in decades, creating a loaded gun aimed prominently at the ballooning Hispanic-American population. They are taking all your jobs, they are filling your classes — even when they are just as American as you. But, as Trump tacitly teaches his supporters, you’re white and they’re not. And it’s time you were first in line again.
So, from a sociopolitical standpoint, it’s very easy to see why these chalkings occur. This is the brilliant manifestation of the attempt by the not-so-brilliant white community to redirect their anger away from themselves and their (again) not-so-brilliant political decisions and blanket it onto a group to call the evil “other.” Because let’s face it — even if President Trump did build a wall, poor whites would never take the menial labor jobs its construction would offer.
Some argue that condemning such chalkings are somehow a freedom of speech issue, even though their clearly racist messages (“f-ck Mexicans”; “deport them all”) are in direct violation of campus codes of conduct. Others would say that college students are simply “oversensitive,” that our desire to keep our living and learning space — which we pay for — free of racially motivated violence and ignorant hatred is somehow a testament to “this generation” and its incorrigible immaturity. To the angry, divorced white grandfather who rants about the sensitivity of the iPhone generation: It is not a mark of immaturity to take the deplorable actions that were once acceptable in your time and decide quite largely, as a society, that they are no longer acceptable. I’m sure these chalkings pale in comparison to the homophobic and racist slurs you used to be allowed to throw around at football practice. But the rest of us realize that backlash against these vandalisms demarcates something important: progress, in what is perhaps the most diverse and divided society of the Western world.
So take it this way: If you’re bothered by the fact that UCSD students came out in droves on all platforms of social media and in person to stand against the racism proliferated by the Trump campaign, you are, whether you like it or not, being swept along feet-first by the tide of progress and hopefully it will eventually drown your tacit racism.
But to those who see these actions for what they are, and seek to stand against them — do. We must express great appreciation for students at Emory University and UCSD who chose to oppose racial divisiveness. I would urge all educated and worldly students to show those who sought to make Hispanic students feel alien that they are the ones who are unwelcome on our campuses. We will teach them that making America “great again” would only truly be possible had America already been great — and this greatness is undeniably due to the roles played by Latinx and Chicanx Americans throughout this nation’s history. So, to those who chalked UCSD, please, chalk again — and know that your desperate messages of misdirected anger are falling on deaf ears.

What an idiotic screed.  I would love to see Tommy Trojan wearing a Make America Great Again cap!
Excellent article. Really liked the analogy to Bacon’s Rebellion and how it put things in perspective historically. Thanks for closing off with a message that resonates (hopefully) regardless of political inclination; “I urge all educated and worldly students to show those who sought to make Hispanic students feel alien that they are the ones who are unwelcome on our campuses.”
This is a change in times folks. SC was an apolitical, somewhat conservative leaning school….but I guess the “hip” zeitgeist is to be liberal. I mean, it’s the college spirit…right?
Another Social Justice Warrior labelling everything as racism? Not surprising.
GO TRUMP!! 2016!!!
What do you suppose would happen in a country where a hostile ruling elite controlled both political parties and owned every presidential candidate?  Every presidential candidate except one….
A freshman majoring in history and political science? That explains it… Did she also use this article for her midterm paper in White Supremasist Theory 101?
Not only does Lily attempt to fight racism with racism, but apparently she fights anger and vitriol with anger and vitriol.  This entire piece is written with tones of anger, disgust, speculation, sarcasm and hatred.  It reminds me of the many groups who attempt to fight segregation by, in fact, segregating themselves.  It was difficult and almost pointless to read beyond the first paragraph as her credibility, wisdom and maturity were all undermined by her intentional misspelling of words like Latino and Chicano, using an “x” to suggest that the scientific fundamentals of gender should no longer apply.  (Spell check may not have flagged her, but I sure will:  This is one young lady whose opinion on anything deserves caution and scrutiny.)
To be clear:  Institutional racism in this country is all but dead, yet individual racism persists.  This is the regrettable result of a free and open society such as ours is.  Hateful chalk drawings like this are proof, and we should speak out against it when we see it.  But returning with anger and hatred against straight white men, or abandoning science by suggesting gender is a state of mind, is not the answer.  A lot of good, intelligent and reasonable people are fed up with the constant flow of illegal immigration to our country.  A lot of good, intelligent and reasonable people are fed up with things like driver’s licenses and law degrees being available to illegal immigrants.  A lot of good, intelligent and reasonable people are fed up with Muslims targeting people around the world with acts of terror.  A lot of good, intelligent and reasonable people are fed up with being told that they might encounter someone of the opposite sex in a public restroom with them.  And most importantly… A lot of good, intelligent and reasonable people are fed up with being told that these feelings are somehow wrong or inappropriate, and that they are racist, homophobic or xenophobic for having them!  
Young ladies like Lily will hopefully learn to take a recess from her own hatred and anger to try to understand why people feel the way they feel, and to learn what cultural and political realities lead to people’s anger and frustration.  I have found that the best way to fight racism is actually not to point fingers, but instead to look in the mirror at one’s own behaviour.  Changing how I behave has a great affect on the behaviour of those around me.  
Nothing excuses racist behaviour, but we certainly need to change our approach in fighting it.
“This is the brilliant manifestation of the attempt by the
not-so-brilliant white community to redirect their anger away from
themselves and their (again) not-so-brilliant political decisions and
blanket it onto a group to call the evil “other.””
So Lily, in your screed against racism, you apparently feel completely comfortable making blatantly racist remarks about the “white community”.  You also have no difficulty making stereotypic comments about “the angry, divorced white grandfather who rants”.  How do you justify using this type of inflammatory, racist, and gender-discriminatory language when you are so concerned about making a  “stand against…racism”?
Since you obviously have no problem making hateful, derogatory statements about entire classes of people I am left to conclude that you are a bigot

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
This week, the Daily Trojan published its supplement issue, “It Takes a Village: USC and the Community,” in which we explored more carefully the issue of gentrification in the local community, the cost of living near campus and the rise of the University Village. We recognized that, as students at USC, our experiences are shaped not just by members of the University but by the surrounding community as well. However, it would be impossible to address USC’s relations with locals without mentioning crucial members of our community — the homeless population.
Last year, a report from the Economic Roundtable stated that each month, 13,000 Angelenos become homeless, in large part due to the effects of rising housing prices and costs of living. This finding has even prompted Mayor Eric Garcetti to declare a state of emergency in a quest to end the epidemic.
These concerns should not be separate from the USC’s responsibilities. Given the University’s unique position within the city, it should adopt a greater role in aiding the homeless population. The University should start by contributing financially to local homeless shelters, or by starting one of its own.
Whether we are aware of it or not, people of the transient community are intertwined with our daily lives. They travel on campus before the gates are drawn at night and off campus to the commercial food establishments students frequent. A short walk from campus, tents — where many consider shelter — line sidewalks along familiar streets.
The University does provide some support to local community members. One academic enrichment program called the Neighborhood Academic Initiative prepares local students for higher education enrollment. Campus organization Swipes Out Hunger, donates leftover students’ dining dollars to the local homeless population at the end of the semester. And in February, the Undergraduate Student Government hosted its first-ever Community Block Party, which connected students and local community members. But the University has not created an initiative to specifically address the homelessness crisis which plagues South Central Los Angeles.
Policy experts have, again and again, pointed to the affordable housing crisis in Los Angeles as a key player in the city’s chronic homelessness. Los Angeles simply doesn’t have enough development, and skyrocketing demands for housing have led to excessive costs of renting or owning homes. As previously reported in the Daily Trojan supplement Wednesday, the ZIP code 90007 which surrounds USC was the second-most expensive ZIP code for rentals in the entire county. By establishing a homeless shelter, USC would be providing much-needed relief for the thousands of Los Angeles’s homeless who find themselves in circumstances in which living is simply impossible.
Instead of giving the homeless needed support, the University’s actions are contributing to part of the problem. Construction has increased property values, displacing local residents and contributing to rising rents. And for all the rhetoric that the University uses in support of its local community, so much of its actions indicate to community members that they are unwelcome. For one, the gates that surround the University Park Campus are not just ugly urban design — they are exclusionary to our community members. They are a visual symbol that, when 9 p.m. comes around, the University doesn’t want those from the community around.
It’s time for the University to turn this image around, and prove to the community — including the homeless — that it is also part of our Trojan Family.
USC wouldn’t be the first top university to establish its own homeless shelter. Called the Y2Y Harvard Square, Harvard University’s student-run homeless shelter offers advocacy, outreach and other service programs to the local homeless population. During the winter months, it serves men and women in the local Cambridge community. If the University supported it financially, a similar operation in South Central Los Angeles could have considerable impact on the local community.
With a nearly $5 billion endowment and in its role as a premiere research university, USC has unmatched economic and social resources, some of which it owes to the surrounding community. It should use this opportunity to redefine what it means to be a socially responsible institution.
Daily Trojan Spring 2016 Editorial Board
I volunteer at homeless shelters and other food service assistance programs. While I laud the writer’s intent of helping the homeless, I don’t agree that this is the University’s responsibility to setup and run a shelter. Notably missing is how such services would be paid for, except to reference the university’s endowment, which the author must know is largely restricted by donor choice and other factors.
The writer also placed the blame on USC for construction as an element in increasing private property values and displacement. Yes, that is a consequence when you build new buildings and neighborhoods change, but the University already agreed to contribute $20M to the city’s affordable housing fund to help offset those inevitable side effects.
There are creative ways to engage the University and its constituents in partnerships with the public sector to alleviate the homeless issue, but ultimately it is the public sector that must bear the lead responsibility and run direct service programs

On Saturday, the USC Women’s Student Assembly will be hosting the fourth annual FemFest, a feminist music festival. Falling on the same weekend as Coachella, this festival isn’t anywhere near the desert, but it does have an important message.
FemFest advocates creating a safe, welcoming and comfortable atmosphere for all people. The festival, founded by USC alumna Kaya Masler, is the rebuttal to a male-dominanted music industry. In addition to introducing an alternative to the cisnormative campus culture, FemFest will offer awareness to students on feminist politics and provide a space that promotes and encourages a more intersectional identity within the USC community.
Located on campus at E.F. Hutton Park, this event is free to all USC students. FemFest will feature a range of musicians, from solo artists to bands, including students from the Thornton School of Music. This year’s lineup includes performances from Chastity Belt, MUNA, Gypsum, The Real Niña Dioz, Minimall, The Unending Thread, Spritely, Nightjars, Jensen McRae, Analiz and Madison Douglas. True to the event’s title, all artists schedule to perform are female.
FemFest emphasizes a lack of diversity within the music industry and is meant to call attention to those who have felt marginalized. While this is a feminist-oriented event, it is not meant to alienate any group or gender; rather, it aims to promote equality for all. According to Vanessa Diaz, executive director of USC Women’s Student Assembly, FemFest centers around a the question: “How can we create a space where we can celebrate these artists?”
This core theme of an all-inclusive festival highlights artists for their accomplishments and is meant to serve as a safe place free of judgment and denigration. Along with music, FemFest will feature a different assortment of art stations around the venue, in addition to an art gallery that will include contributors spanning all across campus, displaying diverse art innovations.
The event is open to the public. USC students must show their ID, while non-USC guests must RSVP through Eventbrite, showing a confirmation along with an ID. The festival runs from 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.

We judge each other so heavily on our music tastes. It is a label, a descriptor that allows others to quickly assess someone new. It’s seen as something personal that ascribes you to a certain sect. But when it comes down to it, music taste, at least for me, is a composite of all those people close to me. My music taste is an assorted array of all the things I’ve stolen from the people generous enough to share. So this is dedicated to those who helped me and those who continue to help me:
Warner
It wouldn’t be a proper dedication if I didn’t discuss the person who began my entire musical evolution. A scrawny little four-eyed boy who spent his free time sketching Jemaine from Flight of The Conchords and Dwight from The Office, Warner was the love of my 12-year-old life. I followed his every word, and with him, most of the words were about music. From Mumford and Sons (before they were popular, of course, Warner wouldn’t have listened if he didn’t think he was the only one) to the Wombats and weird alternative hip-hop, Warner showed me that music wasn’t cut and dry chords crammed into similar sounding vocals. Warner showed me music that made you think, that made you cringe and that made you feel awkward.
My dad
My mom was a Berkeley activist with a laundry list of illegal things done in the name of anti-war
advocacy. I don’t have the word count to explain. But when it came to the parent who taught me about the music that came before, it wasn’t the free lovin’ hippie, it was the small town boy from Ohio. My dad showed me the classics. But never because they were legendary but because they were personal to him. When we listened to Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run,” it wasn’t because it was Springsteen, it was because it was the story of my dad’s life. When we listened to “Card Cheat” by the Clash, it wasn’t to educate me on Joe Strummer, it was because the song made my dad cry.
My sister
Siblings often borrow clothes, make up, even boys (according to most family sitcoms I’ve seen). My sister is six years older than me, so my tiny little 10-year-old body never tried to fit into her post-puberty physique’s clothes, and I wasn’t one for make-up when I was younger. Instead, I took from my sister in the form of iTunes. Much of my early iPod was filled to the brim with whatever albums I could scrounge up from her recently purchased on the family plan — The Hot Hot Heat, Arcade Fire, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin.
Before Spotify hit our family, it was my sister’s leftovers that kept me sane on walks to class, rides on the bus and quiet time in my room.
My boyfriend
Although he came into my life rather recently, my boyfriend served an important purpose. Apart from buying me chocolate on Valentine’s Day, he brought me back to my roots. Coming off of an internship at Billboard, my mind functioned in the mainstream pop world. It’s a world that I will always love but it’s not the only world I like to be in. But after so many months of focusing on the Top 20 and their associated drama, my boyfriend came in and reminded me what else there was. From reminding me of the bands I used to love to showing me ones I would come to love just as much, the indie rock part of my heart came back. More
than that, I began to
appreciate music on new levels. Where before I related to lyrics and loved to sing along, my boyfriend challenged me to listen to songs for their sound and their noise and not just the message. It wasn’t the direct feelings but the underlying musical emotions.
So here’s to them and the many others who gave me what they had and let me shape it as my own. I can’t say thank you enough.

MOCA Grand Avenue’s storefront: Public Fiction: The Poet and The Critic, and the missing installation consists of a small room outside the main gallery directly across from the museum store. The exhibit runs until June 19.
This compact space lives entirely behind glass, not unlike a commercial display window. Within, the space contains a large painted cube, an elegant hanging wire sculpture, a ceramic beach ball, a small, dark, possibly ceramic sculpture, a horizontally oriented flat-screen TV with an image of an Eames chair and accompanying text and two organic wave-like objects composed of what appears to be white and beige plastic. The windows themselves are adorned with several poems, all of which relate to each other aesthetically and typographically.
According to MOCA’s description of the installation on their website, the artists who created the space are Nathaniel Mackey, Nevine Mahmoud and Lynne Tillman, but only Tillman’s name is visible by merely looking through the glass. Furthermore, labeling the storefront “a place for work that is motivated by passion rather than commercial agendas or market trends” in the description both obscures the economic concerns perpetually underscoring the art-making process and indicates that perhaps MOCA is not financially supportive of these artists.
While this description could easily be dismissed as a mere idealized art world trope, it becomes somewhat more sinister when considering the deliberately worded misinformation also present in the installation description. This text depicts MOCA as “founded by artists,” but a quick Wikipedia search reveals that MOCA was in fact, like most other large art institutions, the brainchild of the Los Angeles County Mayor Tom Bradley, City Councilman Joel Wachs, philanthropist Marcia Simon Weisman and several major art collectors in 1979. While MOCA’s theoretical commitment to the initiatives of local artists is admirable, their branding is overly idealized and ultimately downright misleading.
This distortion renders the space not only physically inaccessible, but conceptually as well — the entire installation lacks the transparency to be truly public. Though the whole room can be seen from outside and requires no entrance fee, the doors to the interior are locked and the glare on the glass is intense, making the space difficult to engage with. The individual artist names are minimized and the history of the institution is reworked to fit the theme. It is unclear how the objects in the space or the people that made them embody the idea of public art, public fiction or greater accessibility. Overall, this gives the installation and the objects within it a feeling of opacity at odds with the concept of “the public.”
Sadly, this show falls into the trap of attempting to address “the public” as an impersonal concept through irritatingly unapproachable methods commonly associated with “high” art. Furthermore, some of the wording in the show description indicates the persistence of problematic notions of art as outside capitalist interests and descriptive of the human condition but not comprehensible to the average person. That being said, the publication associated with the installation featuring artists, critics, and poets Sophia Al Maria, Corrine Fitzpatrick, Quinn Latimer, Ann Lauterbach, Fred Moten and Michael Palmer is much more engaging. The layout is hip and simple and the entries are limited to 200 words. In effect, this sparse combination of images and text is a much more concise, interesting, and approachable version of a less successful physical manifestation.
In summation, storefront: Public Fiction is a compelling concept with a well-made publication attached, but not an event worth penciling in unless one arrives early for a reservation at the Broad or a show at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

Junior Nikola Jovanovic has declared for the NBA draft, he announced Thursday afternoon via Twitter.
“Testing the waters presents a big opportunity for me and I’m really excited about what comes next!” the tweet read.
Jovanovic went on to post a series of tweets.
“I have just declared for the 2016 NBA draft but I will not be hiring an agent yet.”
Not hiring an agent allows Jovanovic to return to USC for his final season if he decides to do so.
“In regards to finishing school I will be getting my degree this summer!” Jovanovic tweeted. “I have full support from coach Enfield and the whole athletic department for what I am really grateful for!”
The 6’ 11” forward from Belgrade, Serbia, was the Trojan’s second leading scorer this year, averaging 12.1 points and averaged a team-high 7.0 rebounds per game. He also added 27 blocked shots over the course of the season. Jovanovic played in all 34 of USC’s games.
The announcement is one of many from Trojans who have announced they will not be wearing Cardinal and Gold next season. Junior guard Julian Jacobs declared for the NBA draft, but also declined to hire an agent, leaving room for the possibility of returning to USC.
Redshirt junior forward Darion Clark, sophomore guard Malik Marquetti, sophomore forward Malik Martin and redshirt junior guard Katin Reinhardt have all announced their intent to transfer and complete their collegiate careers elsewhere.
You had a good year, Nikola.  You are close to playing pro but no cigar at this point.
What does that tell you about their love for Coach Enfield. No team concept with a chance to be a force next season on
the court. Something is not right with the program. Interesting that Jacobs and Jovanovic were recruited by previous coach O’Neill.

Click here to explore our Spring 2016 supplement,  “It Takes a Village: USC and the Community.”
With roots in a crowded, historic community, USC is not just located in South Central L.A. — it is partnered with it. Given its recent surge in fundraising and expansion via the USC Village and push toward greater prominence in Southern California, the University’s impact on the surrounding area is more significant than ever.
With youth educational opportunities, outreach initiatives and Dept. of Public Safety patrols of the neighborhood, USC takes an active role as a positive influence. But gentrification, rental prices and the University’s massive appetite for space and housing, while in the best interests of the student body, can take its toll on local businesses and families. As USC spends more than half a million dollars on a major redevelopment project and aims to raise $6 billion by 2018, its momentum as a major educational and cultural hub in Los Angeles will only increase. And as the largest private employer in the entire city, USC fosters a community that extends far beyond student life.
In this supplemental issue of the Daily Trojan, we look at USC’s impact on local families and businesses. We consider the effect of the University on housing and rental prices, and its initiatives to improve the health, safety, and educational opportunities of the local community. Most importantly, we ask the question of what we can and should do in order to create a better environment for the Trojan Family that surrounds our campus.

Call me a nerd but I really, really love learning. Back in my first blog post of the semester, one of my goals was to embrace all the learning opportunities I am lucky enough to have at my disposal at a USC student. I wanted to soak up all the information that I could in my last semester of college. 
Admittedly, I haven’t been as much of a sponge as I should have been all semester. To the potential dismay of my professors (if any of them are reading this, I’m sorry) this semester it was harder than ever to avoid sinking deep into, not only a mid-semester slump, but more like a sinkhole full of quicksand. 
Even my editors at the Daily Trojan are probably chuckling (or maybe shaking their heads in frustration) about how I’ve made use of every second before my deadline — and by that I mean a disproportional amount of the last remaining seconds. 
They say that in college you can have two of three things: sleep, a social life or good grades. For four years I’d say I did a pretty good job of balancing the three-way scale, but in the last month or so, it’s been a struggle to say the least. Today, though, was one of the days when I snapped out of this funk and completely nerded out. 
I started off the day in the Annenberg Media Center. My pre-graduation nostalgia was in full force. Amid the hustle and bustle of the newsroom I took a step back and the time to appreciate how lucky I was to be in such an impressive arena with so many resources at my disposal. 
I’d like to think it’s a good sign for my future in journalism, but I ask a lot of questions. As I completed my video project in one the edit bays of the Media Center, I couldn’t help but reflect on how appreciative I was that there were at least a dozen people that I could pull aside and ask questions — that I was in a place where the sole purpose was to learn new skills and strategies. 
After that little wave of appreciation and nostalgia, I headed to class where we were fortunate enough to have Fox sports reporter Laura Okmin as a guest speaker. Despite the fact that I walked into class with a million other things on my mind — a job interview later that day, assignments I had due, a story I had to finish up before a meeting with my professor that afternoon — I immediately felt locked into the discussion that she led about both issues facing young people as they break into their careers and women in the media. As she spoke about how confidence has been her key to success in gaining the respect of athletes, coaches and other sports commentators, I left the lecture feeling as though I had grasped onto something I could strive to emulate in my own life. 
Feeling engaged and inspired, I headed to to an Annenberg event with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas right after class. My friend and I gushed over the fact that we were in the same room as someone as accomplished as Vargas — an undocumented immigrant who has told the stories of thousands of immigrants like him, and has dissected how we approach issues of race and ethnicity in America. 
Later, I met with a professor and we spoke at length about not only the progress I had made on my final project, but also the future of journalism and public policy fields. It’s days like today where I am thankful to be so passionate about what I’m learning, and be lucky enough to have so many valuable resources at USC.
