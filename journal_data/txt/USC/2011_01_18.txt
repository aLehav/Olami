With the season just beginning, the No. 1 ranked USC men’s volleyball team has adopted an even-keeled mindset to this season’s grueling slate of games, preferring not to dwell heavily on its past success.

“One of the things we’ve had trouble with [in the past] is looking too much toward the future,” said junior opposite hitter Tony Ciarelli. “We need to focus on what we’re doing every game and make sure that we don’t overlook anyone.”
A year ago, the younger Trojan (2-0, 2-0)  squad might have been guilty of overlooking Cal State Northridge, their first round opponent in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament, and suffered an embarrassing upset loss as a result.
Overlooking their next opponent should not be an issue, however, considering it’s the same team that defeated the Trojans in the 2009 National Championship match: No. 7 UC Irvine. The Trojans will square off tonight at 6 p.m. against the Anteaters (3-3, 1-1) at the Bren Events Center in Irvine, Calif.
Although the Anteaters dropped two five-set matches against USC last year, that 2009 national title game remains ingrained in the minds of the mostly upperclassmen USC team.
The Anteaters are currently led by senior outside hitter Cory Yoder and junior opposite Carson Clark. Yoder, the son of Bob Yoder, who was an All-American at USC and coached the Trojans to a national title, registered 13 kills in UC Irvine’s three-set win against UC Santa Barbara Saturday.
“They’re a really good team,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “They have a couple of losses, which is kind of misleading because they’ve been trying to find their ideal lineup.”
After executing in all facets of their game in their first two victories, Ferguson stressed that the team needs to continue its inspired play.
An encouraging development is that the team has carried its intensity into practices, agonizing over every missed spike and blown blocking assignment.
“So far, we’ve won the serve and pass battle, which is the most important battle in volleyball,” Ferguson said. “Even when our service game has faltered, we’ve been passing so well that we’ve forced other teams into errors.”

USC wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator John Morton will leave the Trojans to join new San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh’s staff, USC coach Lane Kiffin announced Tuesday.
Morton, the lone holdover from former USC coach Pete Carroll’s staff, spent the past four seasons at USC.
The 41-year-old coach previously worked with Harbaugh as an assistant with the Oakland Raiders in 2002 and 2003 and under Harbaugh at the University of San Diego in 2005.
“This is a great opportunity for John to further his career,” Kiffin said in a statement released on the team website. “We appreciate the great work he did at USC and wish him the best of luck.”
Morton originally played college football at Grand Rapids Community College and later transferred to Western Michigan. He got his start in coaching with the Raiders as a tight ends coach.
When Harbaugh was hired as coach at San Diego in 2005, Morton followed, taking the position of wide receivers coach. He also spent a year on staff for the New Orleans Saints in 2006.
In 2009, he served as the offensive coordinator for Carroll as well as wide receivers coach, before returning to passing game coordinator in 2010.

USC announced a five-year extension Tuesday for its football and men’s basketball play-by-play contract agreement with 710 ESPN Los Angeles (KSPN).
“We are delighted to continue to have 710 ESPN as our flagship radio outlet for Trojan football and men’s basketball games,” said USC athletic director Pat Haden in a statement. “As the worldwide leader in sports, the way that 710 ESPN has represented USC’s brand is consistent with the way we present it.”
Since the 2006 football season, KSPN has served as the flagship station for the USC Football Radio Network, which spans from Fresno, Calif. to San Diego. Prior to 2006, football and basketball games had aired on KMPC 1540.
Arbogast and former USC and NFL quarterback Paul McDonald will continue to serve as the play-by-play broadcast team for football, while Chris Fisher and Jim Hefner will continue to serve as basketball broadcasters for all games. The extension is scheduled to run through the 2015-16 basketball season.

Ghandi once said, “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.”
Sadly, this timeless lesson never made its way to the town of Kingston, Tenn.
In observance of coach Lane Kiffin’s abrupt departure from Knoxville one year ago,, the owner of the town’s shooting range, concluded that there was no better way to satiate the state’s bitterness and hatred toward the fleeing coach than to destroy bobblehead dolls bearing a likeness of Kiffin’s face for target practice.
When news of this decision made its way to my door, needless to say I felt like Peter Finch from the film Network: “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not going to take this anymore.”
Whether you are for gun control or against it, whether you loved the job Kiffin did in his first year or were left dissatisfied with his overall performance, this should upset you, too.
It should anger you as a student and as a Trojan, but most importantly, as someone who seeks to protect the sanctity and, for that matter, the sanity of sports.
This column isn’t going to dissuade you from your personal beliefs, nor am I intending to sit here and dissect the still noticeable ignorance that sometimes impedes what we consider social progress in our society.
Though Williams and the Frontier Firearms range were forced to shut down plans for their Southern-style shoot-out this weekend, the idea itself still doesn’t sit well with me. Such vengeful plans should not even be up for debate in the first place.
The mere notion that firing off guns, even if aimed at replica dolls, is acceptable payback for decisions made in the sports world is alarming to say the least. It threatens the integrity, values and social significance that the games of our youth have had in this country for centuries.
Not to mention, in the wake of the tragic shootings in Tucson, Ariz., which took the lives of six people, injured several others and left Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in critical condition, it reeks of apathy and tastelessness.
I recognize that sports in some manner have a cult appeal, that people live and die by the moves made by players, coaches, athletic directors and owners, on and off the field.
It’s the reason I can’t walk even a few feet this week without seeing a No. 6 Jets jersey around campus or find myself amazed yet terrified when Angelenos choose to celebrate a Lakers’ championship by destroying whatever they can get their hands on around this city.
So maybe this is a natural coping mechanism, part of a state or regional grieving process that takes more time than many of us can even comprehend.
Nonetheless, I ask, why in this manner?
Why does one move of perceived disloyalty deserve such a despicable response one year later?
The question might be rhetorical.
In fact, I might be searching naively for an answer that likely will never come my way from Williams, the fine people of Kingston or any sports fans who find Kingston’s behavior and intent of action laudable.
But where did we go so wrong in our prioritization of sports that a man who calls plays for a living has become so hated, even his resemblance drawing such maniacal attention?
I get how watching your team fall short in a playoff game or seeing a coach flee cross-country for his dream job hurts to no end, but sports at their core are nothing more than an entertainment-driven diversion.
That’s what makes them so addicting. They have that rare ability to allow followers to become a part of something that is bigger than themselves.
But to be honest with you, just because you fanatically attach yourself to an organization and its fan base, doesn’t mean you are entitled to retribution, especially through violent means, if the business end doesn’t transpire as you envisioned.
“Sometimes what sounds like fun or a good idea just isn’t, and as we have said all along, no one wishes harm to coach Kiffin,” Williams told Foxsports.com regarding the range’s decision to shutdown the event.
Unfortunately, the 2,000 miles separating Los Angeles and Kingston may have blurred the lines between what is comical and what is moronic.
It appears that the unsurprisingly trite Williams and his gun-toting minions don’t seem to understand how his grand scheme didn’t seek just to harm Kiffin.
It sought to harm the entire USC community, including its fans, alumni and those like myself, who still choose to believe that the beauty of sports exists in spite of its well-documented flaws.
All of you have suffered through the tremendously difficult year this university’s athletic program has endured.
Yet, the disparity between how you handled the sanctions, the basketball and football seasons without a bowl or Pac-10 tournament appearance, compared with Tennessee’s reaction to Kiffin’s departure, is mind-boggling.
As for the Volunteer State, Williams and the Frontier Firearms range, my advice for you in the coming year is to take Ghandi’s message to heart.
Being a sports fan isn’t an easy title to take on, but if there is one thing that can make life a little easier, it’s knowing when to simply move on.
Lane Kiffin has, and so should you.

loosen up. The gun range thing was nothing but a dumb joke. To even closely link what happned in AZ with this is just plain stupid. I would ask people like you to stop making our lives unlivable with your constant status of being offended, and constantly whining. Get a life.

Stanford football coach Jim Harbaugh announced Jan. 7 he was leaving to become the next coach of the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers, signing a lucrative five-year, $25-million contract.
Recruiting power · NCAA-imposed sanctions have not stopped Lane Kiffin from finding top talent. USC’s commits currently rank 5th in the nation, according to Rivals.com. - Daily Trojan File Photo 
“It’s the perfect, competitive opportunity,” said the former NFL signal caller at his introductory press conference regarding the decision to bolt for the professional ranks.
In the aftermath of Harbaugh’s departure, the Cardinal swiftly promoted offensive coordinator David Shaw to head coach, hoping to continue the success the program had achieved under Harbaugh’s watch, culminating in a 12-1 finish and an Orange Bowl victory earlier this month.
If recent results on the recruiting trail serve as any indication, however, it won’t be a seamless transition after all, and USC stands to benefit as a result.
On Monday, USC coach Lane Kiffin and the Trojans received an oral commitment from Anthony Sarao of Absecon, N.J., a four-star linebacker according to Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, who had previously been committed to Stanford.
The announcement came just one day after four-star running back Amir Carlisle from Sunnyvale, Calif. announced that he was also switching his commitment from Stanford to USC.
“Amir is going to USC,” said his father Duane in a text message to Scout.com recruiting analyst Brandon Huffman.
Saroa and Carlisle were among a group of 19 prospects visiting USC on official and unofficial recruiting visits this past weekend. The number of recruits on campus was one of the largest totals in the program’s recent history.
When making his decision, Saroa told USCFootball.com, “It was a perfect visit. I had a great time out there.”
The campus wasn’t the only selling point, however, as the New Jersey native admitted to being rather fond of the coaching staff’s pedigree.
“USC has one of the best coaching staffs in college football,” Sarao also told the Rivals.com USC-centric website. “They definitely know what they’re talking about.”
The Trojans’ staff includes highly regarded defensive coordinator Ed Orgeron, in addition to assistant head coach Monte Kiffin, who has been credited with creating the famed Tampa-2 defense. If Sarao had remained a Stanford commit, he would not only be playing for a new coach, but also a new defensive coordinator, after Vic Fangio announced he was leaving for the 49ers along with Harbaugh.
Many recruiting analysts say Sarao, who is ranked seventh overall at his position by Rivals.com, has great strength, as ball carriers have had a difficult time escaping after first contact. The 6-foot-1, 220-pound linebacker can also go toe-to-toe with fullbacks when he blitzes or tries to shoot through the gaps.
And with starters Malcolm Smith and Michael Morgan graduating, Saroa, who is expected to provide help at the linebacker position, addresses an area of severe need for the Trojans.
In terms of depth and position need, Carlisle also represents a needed pickup, becoming USC’s only running back for the 2011 class. Ranked by Rivals.com as the 10th best player at his position, Carlisle measures 5-foot-10 and weighs 181-pounds.
Huffman has compared him to former California standout and 2010 NFL Draft pick Jahvid Best, who was known for his speed and breakaway ability.
Carlisle runs a 4.43 40-yard dash and can catch passes well coming out of the backfield, which will make him a two-dimensional threat for the Trojans.
“Both are great pickups,” Huffman said Monday via Twitter. “Carlisle will end up being the top running back in the West and is extremely versatile.”
“Sarao is a big hitter and really physical. Not real tall, but thick with great agility and range.”
The Trojans currently have 25 commitments for their 2011 class, ranked as fifth-best nationally according to Rivals.com.
Under NCAA sanctions, USC would normally be permitted to offer just 15 scholarships per recruiting class. Because the school is appealing the penalties, however, the limitation will not be enforced until 2012, allowing the program to offer a maximum of 20 scholarships, including the nine early enrollees that count toward the 2010 totals.
It is still possible that USC could self-impose further and offer just 15 scholarships.

USC freshman guard Bryce Jones announced Tuesday that he will transfer, leaving the men’s basketball program just 18 games into the season.
“Bryce Jones has informed us of his desire to leave USC and transfer to another school,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill in a story published on the team website. “We appreciate his contributions to our program, and we wish Bryce and his family all the best. He’s a talented player with a promising future.”
Recruited by O’Neill from Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Calif., Jones was the highest rated player in USC’s 2010 recruiting class.
He started the first 10 games this season before losing his starting position to sophomore transfer Jio Fontan from Fordham University, who became eligible Dec. 18 against Kansas.
Through 18 games, Jones, a Los Angeles native, averaged 7.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in 20.6 minutes per game.
But in a statement released by the school, Jones cited a lack of playing time, not his replacement as starting guard, as the reason for his decision to transfer.
“My family and I felt it was in my best interest to transfer, so I informed coach O’Neill of this yesterday,” Jones said. “Although my time at USC didn’t go exactly how I had hoped in terms of playing time, I appreciate the experience I was offered and wish my teammates nothing but the best in the future.”
Since receiving a technical foul in the waning minutes of the Dec. 23 game against Lehigh, Jones saw a significant drop in playing time, averaging just five minutes per game.
In the team’s most recent contest against Oregon State last Saturday, Jones played for only four minutes.

The Green Hornet is an anomaly.
Screenshot from "The Green Hornet" 
A long-running character who straddled the line between Batman-like superhero and Shadow-esque pulp hero, he is best known for the 1960s television series that featured Bruce Lee as Kato and introduced the world to the martial arts expert.
The initial premise of the 1930s radio serial created by George W. Trendle and Fran Striker was simple: Newspaper publisher Britt Reid and his valet Kato fought corruption at night under the identity of the Green Hornet and his nameless chauffeur.
And now it’s a movie directed by indie-favorite Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), starring Seth Rogen as the title character.
Here, the unexpected crew takes the title character and transforms his universe into a story that stays true to the Green Hornet’s history, since there isn’t a strong mythos beyond the pairing of Reid and Kato. But the film does offer something fresh for the superhero genre.
When his father (Tom Wilkinson) dies, Reid finds himself in charge of a struggling newspaper and desperate to do something with his pent-up emotions over his father’s death.
Enter Kato (Jay Chou), a jack-of-all-trades whose skills range from martial arts to mechanics, skills that Reid lacks. After some bonding, the pair begin to fight crime as a means to do something with their otherwise wasted lives.
As the Green Hornet, Rogen is surprisingly good for what initially feels like a random role for the actor. There are times, especially in the beginning, where he comes across as a hyper-inflated version of the boorish characters he tends to play, but it works.
Rogen’s antics help solidify Reid’s immaturity and desire to do something with his life. When it comes to the more serious moments, however, Rogen manages to mature and bring some depth to the role.
As Kato, Chou is brilliant. Although he could easily be relegated to fight scenes, Chou infuses Kato with a snarky wit, a fun-loving attitude and numerous little quirks and reactions that could easily go unnoticed, but help flesh out the character.
The film is as much about fighting crime as it is about Reid and Kato’s relationship, and the actors make it work. Some of the best moments are their bonding scenes. The pairing is central to the film, and with any other set of actors, it might have sunk the movie.
Another pleasant surprise is Christoph Waltz as the film’s villain, Chudnofsky. the Inglourious Basterds actor brings a mix of menace and eccentricity that perfectly fits the tone of the film. Like Chou, Waltz’s small touches to his character, from trying to come up with cool ways to reinvent himself to his sporadic outbursts during action scenes, add a deeper layer to Chudnofsky and keep the film from focusing too heavily on the Reid-Kato relationship.
Under Gondry’s direction, the action is surprisingly strong. Kato, as is the tradition since the Bruce Lee days, is an unstoppable fighting machine. Some of the fights begin small, but by the end of the film, the action is pervasive and incredibly creative.
The climactic action scene, a three-part set piece, rivals that of any other action film produced in Hollywood and, thanks to the performances, feels more energetic than most.
Gondry is known for turning his movies into heavy metaphors — Be Kind, Rewind on the movie-watching experience or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind on love — and The Green Hornet has a similar theme, although it is satisfyingly subtle.
The idea of identity and public image is brilliantly weaved through the film, from Reid to Chudnofsky.
At times the film can feel a bit blunt, but its strong performances and subtle themes give it surprising depth.
Is The Green Hornet what Trendle and Striker had in mind with the character? Probably not. The humor can be a bit overdrawn, and the plot could have been a bit tighter. But despite the unlikely assembly of collaborators, The Green Hornet is a surprisingly fun film that stands on its own, transcending the genre it belongs to.

For every Rick Ross-type, the self-proclaimed ghetto MC still boasting about drugs, girls and money over triumphant beats, there’s a Kid Cudi, the self-loathing rapper-singer clad in skinny jeans.
Though the Cudi-esque rappers were new and different at one point in recent history, their style has now become an increasingly popular trend.
Such is the inevitable end of every subculture  movement: If everyone’s claiming to be a Martian, as Lil Wayne, Cudi and numerous others have on various tracks, nobody’s really different after all.
Right in our Californian backyard, however, a new breed of hip-hop is brewing. It’s not exactly definable.
In a word, it’s odd.
Fittingly, the group that is so bravely defying the hip-hop norms is Los Angeles’ own Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, a group of 11 musicians, artists and skaters slowly gaining popularity in the music world.
My first introduction to this group was the grotesque video for member Earl Sweatshirt’s track “Earl,” in which Odd Future members drink a gross blended drink and then puke from it, skate and bleed from their nipples, among other disgusting things.
Next, I followed group figurehead Tyler, The Creator on Twitter after seeing his Kanye West-surpassing tweets, such as “Thank You So Much Sir For Letting Me Dookie On Myself In Peace,” “I Wonder What Being Table Feels Like,” “Sometimes, I wonder what Shopping Feels Like” and “I Am Pooty Tangs Hair Do.” And that’s only an example of one member’s strangeness.
Odd Future has been called “the new Wu-tang” because the group is composed of 11 young, collaborative friends, each with different personalities to bring to Tyler The Creator’s impressive beats.
They’re young (Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt less than 20 years old) and savvy, releasing albums for free on their Tumblr page and using the word “swag” to describe everything that they like.
Tyler, The Creator’s own mixtape, Bastard (released last year) begins with a rant that insults nearly everything that mainstream and underground hip-hop stand for.
It then goes straight into a piano-based song with depressing lyrics. Notably, the rapper often talks about his relationship with his father, who abandoned him when he was younger.
Much of Bastard and other Odd Future tracks deal with taboo subjects such as rape, murder and homosexual insults.
As with most rappers that talk about anything, it’s hard to tell when these guys really mean what they’re saying.
Their lyrics beg the “Die Antwoord” question: Are these guys for real? Or are they just genius enough artists, good enough at acting to fool the world into believing their characters? And does that even matter?
Eminem probably never did half the things he talked about in his records as Slim Shady, yet his albums catapulted him to superstardom.
The point is not whether or not Odd Future’s stories are real, but that people increasingly love listening to them.
But Odd Future is not the only propagator of this trend.
Even weirder is Lil B, a former member of Pack (you may remember their popular “Vans” song).
His solo work is, again, odd. His simple beats and hooks make him sound like a strange Soulja Boy, but he’s much more than that.
For instance, one of his songs is called “Miley Cyrus,” and the chorus is, I’m Miley Cyrus / Driving with no license repeated over and over.
He also has similar songs claiming to be Paris Hilton, Ellen DeGeneres, Mel Gibson and Bill Clinton.
Like Odd Future, he loves the word “swag,” and he yells it on almost every song. Bay Area legend Too $hort has said, “I love Lil B … but I have no idea how to define what Lil B does.”
Lil B himself would describe what he does as “based music,” a genre he invented to describe his strange, stream-of-consciousness flows.
But his songs vary so much and that description is so ambiguous that it doesn’t really explain anything.
Whatever he’s doing is working, as he’s selling out shows and catching headlines for his unusual antics.
Artists such as Odd Future and Lil B might not be revolutionary musicians or even particularly talented, but at least they’re pushing the evolution of hip-hop and attempting to do something different — and that’s swag.

For a filmmaker whose style is undeniably modern, Edgar Wright has a surprising love for the cinema of the past.
The director of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Wright creates work that in many ways is a spiritual successor to older films.
And now, at the New Beverly Cinema, Wright is sharing his love for the medium with Los Angeles.
Smile for the Camera · Edgar Wright uses the Beverly New Cinema program to bring underwatched films to current movie fans. -  Photo courtesy of Piper Ferguson  
Movie enthusiasts and afficionados who attend “The Wright Stuff II” series, which launched Saturday and runs through Jan. 31, are best compared to kids in a candy shop of great filmography.
Throughout this series’ exhibition, the New Beverly Cinema will run double features of movies selected by Wright, with a repeat the next night. The series is Wright’s second outing in theater programming, with his first show, “The Wright Stuff,” running back in 2007.
“I was in L.A. after promoting Hot Fuzz and the New Beverly had programmed a double bill, and [Quentin] Tarantino told me about it,” Wright said. “Before that happened, very sadly the manager died; it was very dark, it was closed for months maybe, at least a couple of weeks, and no one knew what would happen.”
The theater reopened, and the British director’s involvement gave the staff the idea for what would eventually become “The Wright Stuff.”
“The first double bill back on was mine,” Wright said. “I went down to do a Q&A after each one. It was really fun, there was a great crowd.”
“After that, [Michael Torgan and Julia Marchese of the New Beverly] suggested the idea of me programming, which I did in December of 2007. Programming was one of the most fun things I’ve ever done. Ever since, they’ve asked me to do it again, and we finally found a window.”
Wright particularly enjoys working with the New Beverly, as the theater gives him a chance to expose younger viewers to films they might not have seen before.
The films in the series vary, from big hits like Dirty Harry and American Graffiti, to lesser known movies such as Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, Duel and foreign films like Run Lola Run. The program has also attracted a slew of directors from Joe Dante to Diablo Cody.
But “The Wright Stuff II” is not just a chance for Wright to show the films.
Each night the New Beverly pairs the movies with trailers that complement the double bill, creating a complete cinematic experience.
Saturday’s opening show featured trailers handpicked by Tarantino, including classic films like Carrie and exploitation films like Fuzz.
Many of the films are thematically paired together, like a double feature of Dirty Harry and The Super Cops, or American Graffiti and Animal House, but Wright is more concerned with exposing viewers to films that, to his surprise, have fallen off the radar.
Wright is working hard on the series, but also thinking about future projects.
Along with having his name attached to Marvel Studio’s Ant-Man, he is starting to brainstorm The World’s End, the final film in his unofficial “Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy”  also known as “Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy,”  that also consists of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.
“[Simon Pegg and I] need to sit down and write,” Wright said. “Last night was really nice because we aren’t often in the same room, he’s been really busy. It was really great to watch Shaun and Hot Fuzz with him.”
“We started talking about the movies on the car back and it was really good, [it] got us inspired.”
For now, Wright is enjoying being a movie fan and watching his favorite films with the people of Los Angeles.
“I think it’s a thrill for people to see these movies on the big screen for the first time. I get very excited for that,” he said. “I try and sort of imagine what it would be like for me as a film fan seeing these movies on the big screen for the first time.”

Unnecessary rules are forcing emotion out of professional sports, much to the detriment of athletes and their faithful fans.
The NFL playoffs serve as a defining example of league officials assuming the roles of censors and czars, and thus making dynamic and outspoken players into robots.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Sunday’s matchup between the Jets and Patriots was the most-watched NFL divisional playoff game in history. And although the trash talk wasn’t the single biggest factor, it certainly added to the hype and buzz of the game.
Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie had no problem ranting about Patriots’ quarterback Tom Brady’s “classlessness” during the Pats’ victory in December. Jets coach Rex Ryan also added that “Brady thinks he studies more than he does.”
Patriots wide receiver Wes Welker coyly struck back by making references to feet and toes 11 times during his eight-minute press conference last week, alluding to Ryan’s foot-fetish scandal.
The NFL, however, issued a statement early Saturday morning before two other rivals, the Ravens and the Steelers, faced off, warning teams and players to cut down on the badmouthing.
The statement followed a precedent the NBA set earlier this season.
This summer, NBA commissioner David Stern issued a memo to the referees to crack down on complaining. The association instituted specific rules, such as how many seconds a player’s arms can be held in the air, to determine guidelines for issuing technical fouls.
No longer can teams and players be publicly allowed to hate each other, or have a genuine reaction to a win or loss. Often the greatest games and the biggest upsets can be fueled by an adrenaline rush because of the increased emotion. But the emotion is now being regulated.
Many die-hard NBA fans point to the Lakers-Celtics rivalry in the ’80s as being the pinnacle of basketball history. They were two star-studded teams, led by two hyper-competitive leaders who wanted nothing more than to win.
These games had more fire and passion in one minute than many present NBA finals matchups, which have been tame because of NBA commissioner David Stern’s hard-line stance on exhibiting emotion. And truly, it’s hurting the game.
Fans want to know that the players care as much as they do about the result of the game. They want to see emotions ranging from elation to extreme disappointment.
Michael Jordan hugging his first NBA championship trophy and spilling tears of joy, Tiger Woods fist-pumping after a crucial putt, Tim Tebow crying after losing the BCS championship — these are all iconic images in sports history that fans will never forget.
Emotion is a fundamental part of sports, especially during the playoffs. But nothing the Jets and the Patriots did last week was malicious. It’s a storied rivalry, with two teams that just flat-out hate each other and want and need to win.
The buildup led to historic television ratings for the league, and the fire that both teams displayed during the game was fun for any football fan to watch.
Jets players and coaches ran around in joyous celebration after the victory. Jets receiver Braylon Edwards did a backflip, Ryan was running down the sidelines (an image that has been unfortunately ingrained into minds everywhere).
In modern sports, it’s rare to see that kind of celebration, even after a Super Bowl victory.
The week leading up to the Jets-Patriots face-off made it a more interesting game to watch than it already was. Every first down was crucial, every decision amplified. The stakes were raised.  And it was a game that resmbled why we love sports in the first place.

Arriving at USC, I had mixed feelings about the Greek system.
After a semester here, I’m not the only one. Many are divided on the subject of Greek affiliation, especially when it comes to social activities.
Though many people in the Greek system love it, many who aren’t Greek are quick to criticize. With a system so polarizing, what we really need is a stronger bridge between Greeks and independents to help end the social schism that we see Thursday and Saturday nights at USC.
Many students know that Greek social life can be heavily political. You have different houses, rivalries and tiers.
On top of that, there’s the entire rush process that can be either a dream come true or a nightmare for a rushing hopeful.
To make matters worse, there are the stereotypes and stigmas that surround the various fraternities and sororities. People will judge a house based on the actions of one member, whether an incident occurred recently or many years ago.
We must take into account, however, that for something to be so popular, it at least has to be interesting.
And surely many friends have been made on The Row. In fact, that’s a prime reason to get involved with a fraternity or sorority: You meet a ton of people.
Despite the benefits of Greek life, independents might  suggest that fraternities should let anyone into their parties.
But if that were to happen, we would see a highly disproportional female-to-male ratio. And no one — Greek or non-Greek — benefits from this method.
A lot of people might either go to Hollywood, or hang out with friends in the dorms or apartments. As an independent myself, I’ve found alternative options, and there have been many nights when my friends and I have walked around apartment complexes going from one small party to the next.
Still, as an independent I don’t mind occasionally paying a small fee to experience the Greek social scene for a night.
Like it or not, cover fees are often the only feasible way to blend the two cultures.
Often these cover charges are for the charity events that each house throws from time to time. Anyone who pays can go, and it’s all for a good cause.
We could all benefit from more of these events. Ticket prices keep people from just going in and out to get free drinks. Plus, not only do students get to see big-name artists, but they also get to contribute to a charitable cause.
The Greek system might not see the advantages of accommodating independents. With such a prominent role in our campus and in the community, though, the Greek scene should do everything it can to reach out to the entire student body. If it were to do that, there would be much less animosity toward the system.
The bottom line: People want to have fun with their friends, Greek or not. Let’s make it easier for people to party together. An entry fee is certainly a small price to pay.
There is no reason why Greeks and non-Greeks can’t enjoy college life together.
Clinton VanSciver is an undeclared sophomore.
This article is utterly nonsensical.  
Assuming the issue is how to fix the divide, the first five paragraphs are a list of considerations that have no relation to the issue: what do greek politics and rush stress have to do with the greek/non-greek divide?
Next is this sentence: “Despite the benefits of Greek life, independents might  suggest that fraternities should let anyone into their parties.”  Why would independent suggest that “despite the benefits of greek life”?  The causal link seems a bit weak, no?
Next. we’re told that if parties were open to all, “we would see a highly disproportional female-to-male ratio.”  This seems like a gender issue to me. Yet, the author proposes to fix this gender issue with price discrimination, which does not seem like a to-the-point way to solve the problem.  How would an entry fee change the ratio?
Finally, it seems that the core thesis is that “there would be much less animosity toward the system” if greeks charged an entry fee to their parties?  What makes the author think that haters would be drawn to a system they don’t like at the first place if they had to pay?
It says the author is undeclared.  Dude, stay away from anything related to argumentation, you’ll probably fare better at math.
Hooray for the Daily Trojan endorsing the sale of liquor without a liquor license!! Sounds like either someone did not do their research or is running a very clever ABC trap.

After an extremely disappointing release in Underclass Hero in 2007, Sum 41’s first track off of their new CD show great promise for the band.
Underclass Hero was a record marked by recycled guitar riffs and blatant similarities to hits from both the band’s past catalogue and other bands’ releases.The songs on that disc leaned far more to the pop side of their pop-punk genre, and it can most likely be attributed to the fact that their original guitarist left the band prior to the release.
Sum 41 | Creative Commons
Their previous record, Chuck, was a much heavier album, with metal elements and scathing lyrics, injecting a furious energy into the mix — an energy and aggressive attitude that were distinctly absent from Underclass Hero.
Now, though, the Canadian quartet is returning with Screaming Bloody Murder, which is to be released on March 31, 2011.
The record’s title track and first single premiered on the radio station 89x on Jan. 13, well-received by both critics and fans. Throughout the recording process, the band blogged that the record would sound heavier and more like Chuck, and the pounding drums, blaring guitar riffs and guttural vocals provided by frontman Deryck Whibley certainly call to mind that entire record.
The band, though, shows some evolution in the mature beginning and ending of the song, with Whibley singing soft vocals over a piano.
With this single, Sum 41 have returned to form, and it will be exciting if the rest of the tracks can continue that trend upon their release in March.
