On Monday, more than 100 USC custodians, students and faculty marched from Trousdale Parkway to USC Village to protest for fair wages and benefits from Aramark, the subcontractor through which USC has hired many of its campus workers for years. The current deal in place expired Thursday, and the Service Employees International Union, the union that represents the custodians, is in the process of negotiating a fairer deal for workers.

Specifically, organizers told the Daily Trojan they are asking Aramark to acknowledge that its workers’ needs are not fully met by the minimum wage, and widen access to health care benefits by reducing the employee contribution requirement. As negotiations with Aramark continue, it’s worth noting that USC has been patronizing this company for hiring services for the past two decades. And yet, in response to Monday’s protest, the University said it did not have a comment because it is “not involved in the negotiations.”
But even if USC may not want to be involved, it already is by giving Aramark business. According to a brochure distributed at the protest, the current president and CEO of Aramark made $7,847 per hour last year, while the company’s employees at USC say they are struggling to access basic health care and make ends meet. They are, after all, living in the eighth most expensive city in the world. To continue patronizing a company and turn a blind eye to the abuses and exploitation that its workers are protesting is to play an active role in said abuses and exploitation.
USC often boasts about its role as one of Los Angeles’ biggest employers, and a leading creator of jobs in the country. One of the selling points of USC Village was the myriad employment opportunities that businesses and residence halls would offer to the community. But being a big employer does not equate to being a fair one. It’s not enough for USC to simply hire employees from the surrounding community. The University must also take an active role in shaping how employees and on-campus workers are treated. 
The custodians, security guards and other workers USC hires through Aramark are an integral part of student, faculty and visitors’ experiences. They keep our campus and the area around campus clean and safe; they are a crucial component of students’ everyday lives, and their defining roles in the Trojan experience cannot be taken for granted any longer. 
One of the ways USC can take an active role is through reconsidering its ties with Aramark if the company does not meet its workers at the table, and agree to suitable terms. If the University is as big of an employer as it claims, then Aramark must benefit greatly from USC’s continued patronage. And as one of the most powerful institutions of higher education in the country, USC arguably has more bargaining power than other parties involved. After completing the ambitious USC Village and surpassing the equally ambitious goals of the University’s fundraising campaign, Campaign for USC, for USC to understate its power, influence and financial clout now that its workers need them is a display of tone-deafness and apathy.
These protests led by USC workers are nothing new, and have spanned years — years of the same demands, frustrations and inequalities. Over the course of the past decades, USC has embarked on a number of projects such as housing expansion and other large-scale constructions that have often had negative or disruptive effects on the surrounding community. Some of these effects include the displacement of families and communities of color, which has led to negative effects on locals’ health and access to health care among other struggles. 
In press release after press release, the University has tried to save face by pointing out how its growth has simultaneously yielded job growth. But in light of these protests and USC’s refusal to use its influence to protect its workers, these are claims we can no longer accept at face value.
Perhaps, as USC says, the University is “not involved” in the negotiations right now. But as students, we must collectively demand that the University get involved. USC aims to make its student body into active, civically minded leaders and  community members. And yet, in this situation, we are arguably learning more about leadership and community involvement from Aramark protest organizers than from our administrators. 
In order to meet our responsibilities as Trojans and become the engaged leaders our University wants us to be, we must ask more of USC and stand in solidarity with Aramark-contracted employees here on our campus and in our community. We must give back to the custodians and workers who have inextricably shaped our experiences as students for the better, and moreover, we must demand that our University do same.

Last Friday, President Donald Trump was forced, grumbling all the while, to sign an omnibus spending bill he most definitely didn’t want to sign (expressions of displeasure, pouting and reiterations of disappointment while pouting, lasted into and well after his pen hit the paper). While its passage was no victory for Trump or his nativist following, the bill certainly didn’t make a bad day for the congressional Democrats — or, funny enough, Congressional Republicans. 
On the one hand, the Democrats made individual gains — the bill certainly included enough pork for everyone, Republicans included — but on the other, Democrats demonstrated once more the ability to stand their ground on the issues that count. No funding for the border wall or the feverish hiring of thousands more border agents — only repairs for existing infrastructure; no cuts to foreign aid, environmental protection programs or the diplomatic corps; no school vouchers; and the National Education Association and the Environmental Protection Agency are still standing. Poisonous riders were removed from the bill by Democratic leaders, even at the expense of incurring powerful interest group ire. Republican Senator from Alaska Lisa Murkowski was rebuffed when she tried to attach a rider dismantling protections for Alaskan forests. Republican Senator from Mississippi Thad Cochran tried to drain Mississippi’s vital wetlands to make room for territorial expansion by soybean corporations, also to no avail.
Let us all rejoice that, even in some of the poorest of circumstances, Democrats have grown a backbone, and seem to be gaining energy as 2018 nears. Our Congressional minority has rallied to solve its collective action problem — managing to keep together a coalition of resistance that, though it falters, never fractures. Thus, it has been up to the Republicans to maintain the near-entirety of their slim Senate majority to achieve key points of the agenda — most of which is a wishlist Trump determined in 2016. 
Trump’s demands have been the party’s commands for much of the year; if in the second term of former President Barack Obama, Republicans bowed to Tea Party pressure, our first (and hopefully only) Trump term has seen them brought to the heel of nativism and populism. (Its existence and potency in general is also their doing, but, of course, that’s for another column.) The key with the omnibus package was that Trump detested it, yet Congressional Republicans tacked on as much pork as they could and passed it anyway. Why? 
Trump isn’t up for reelection in 2018; the Republican Congressional majority, however, is. Perhaps this is where the almighty Consent of the Governed crosses paths with Trumpism. Certainly many Senate Republicans would like to satisfy much of Trump’s laundry list — but they love reelection more. It would be tragic indeed to lose one’s seat by stymying the government over a lost opportunity to kill the EPA. And as all politicians know too well, it’s difficult to get credit for what you only “tried” to accomplish — especially when dysfunction and government shutdown is the result.
Trump’s reaction, of course, is exactly what you would expect: The bill is “ridiculous,” he is “unhappy” about much of the bill, “we were forced” to sign it and his great sacrifice, of course, is for — only for — our military. Next steps include: stomping down to Mar-a-Lago and slamming the door. So, this might be the lesson congressional Democrats could learn about resistance — Trump and his popularity survive based on different standards than do the seats of his congressional majority. Trump can puff up his chest, tweet and bluster to the general delight of his base. Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan’s soothing equivocations and Senator Mitch McConnell’s melancholic disavowals of Democrats and their wily ways are generally, for voters, insufficient when action is absent. In certain advantageous situations, damaging Trumpian legislation can only be passed as far as it is immediately achievable. If the Democratic coalition remains strong, if the free press continues to doggedly report and if we maintain our promise to hold our representatives accountable in 2018, the worst aspects of the Trump administration’s platform could be avoided. 
The final lesson of the omnibus package isn’t a new one: When midterms come around, vote.

NoMBe’s debut album, They Might’ve Even Loved Me, is exemplary contemporary storytelling. Its production rivals the work of veteran R&B musician Blood Orange, and its lyrics beautifully tell the story of the influential women in NoMBe’s life, including his godmother, the legendary Chaka Khan. The result is truly a work of art and is a contender for one of the best albums of the year so far.

Born in Germany and based in Los Angeles, Noah McBeth, who performs under the moniker NoMBe, spent four years writing, producing and composing his debut album. The result is a mix of electric soul that combines the genres of jazz, funk, hip-hop and rock ‘n’ roll. Each song is dedicated to a woman in his life, telling stories of heartbreak, hookups and kinship. 
“It’s more stories about my mom or stories about exes or a girlfriend or a hookup or a friend,” NoMBe told Baeble Music. “It’s all these personal stories of the last couple of years that made up the album.”
 On “Wait,” NoMBe recalls his middle school crush on a friend who lived next door. “I won’t wait this time, no, not now, not again,” he says in the song, fighting his fear to confess his feelings. The song “Eden” personifies love and addresses it as a person from his past, as NoMBe wrestles with the idea of falling in love again while realizing humanity’s flaws. The lyrics also reference religion and are symbolic of a man having a conversation with God, discussing lost faith and contemplating what to do next. 
Of all the 18 songs on the album, two singles that stand out are “Man Up” and “Drama.” “Man Up” sees NoMBe questioning the role men play in society, while also addressing the impact society has on men. NoMBe, who tours with an all-female band and is assisted by his all-female creative team, identifies as a feminist, telling Clash Music, “I’m trying to point out how we are often not allowed to show weakness. On the surface, it is definitely a call to action for men to step their game up and be better.” 
On “Drama,” NoMBe recounts a fight he had with his girlfriend, performing and managing his private life. In the end, he deems it all to be just drama: “Ain’t nothin’ but drama,” he sings in the chorus, “I’m just playing a part/When I’m feeling the spotlight, I see nothing but stars.”
 The mix of genres creates a refreshing album that keeps listeners on their toes, with the individuality of each song highlighting specific instances in his life. Amid the electric jazz and the dream pop tracks is the stunning acoustic ballad, “Rocky Horror.” Recorded in one take, the concept spawned from NoMBe’s fascination with the aesthetics of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and he considers it the most personal song he’s ever written. “I dedicate this song to my mother, Mary McBeth, and to anyone who has lost a loved one to prison of any kind,” he told Clash Music.

Chicago-based artist Ravyn Lenae gave a dazzling sold-out performance at the Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood Wednesday night, in an effort to promote her third EP “Crush.” The EP, which was executive produced by Steve Lacy, a member of the band The Internet, is an idiosyncratic take on soul music. 
Ravyn Lenae stayed true to theme on the “Crush” tour, projecting hearts and arrows onto the walls throughout. Photo courtesy of Atlantic Records.
On Wednesday night, Lenae gave the audience a beautiful show. She performed songs from her past three EPs, singing and switching between various genres in ways most professionals can’t. Live, her voice was stunning, and at times, angelic. She sang in a whistle register that was soulful, smooth and reminiscent of Minnie Riperton and performed spoken word poetry over steady beats in the style of Erykah Badu. Imitating SZA’s soft singing voice, she found a way to harmoniously incorporate it into her own personal style. 
She was wildly charismatic the entire night, and her youthful energy served as the interlude for each song. She asked the audience questions about love and long-distance relationships. She promoted body positivity and self-love. Her stage confidence, impressive for such a young artist, showed what a polished performer she  already is, as well as her potential to become even greater. 
“Promise me one thing,” she said in the beginning of her concert. “Promise to move your body, and promise to sing the lyrics.” It was hard for the audience to break that promise, as she delivered her set in electrifying fashion. 
She led the audience into a performance of her released single, “Sticky,” which was one of the best performances of the night. Her vocal delivery was what set her apart from most, and her ability to wrap her voice around a beat truly captured the heart and soul of a song.
She also brought out Lacy for their song, “4 Leaf Clover,” as heart and arrow graphics were projected onto the walls. The song expressed her jealousy toward a boy she has a crush on but who has gone off talking to other girls instead of committing to her. The audience went wild when Lacy took the stage, but it was still Lenae who won the most attention.
Next, she advocated for self-love in “The Night Song.” 
“People like to stare/I don’t really care what you think/oo I like my hair today,” she sang, embracing the large, curly afro she was sporting that night. Easing into the chorus, she sang, “Got my edges on tight it’s a party tonight,” and encouraged other girls to love their bodies and natural hair.
As the night wrapped up, the crowd began cheering for her encore. She returned to the stage, gave one last speech, and began singing a stunning rendition of Outkast’s song, “Prototype.” Wednesday night’s performance seemed like only the beginning of what is sure to be an artistically innovative career.

Since coming to USC, I’ve had to make difficult choices about which organizations to get involved in. As someone who, both in high school and college, tends to sign up for anything and everything that catches my eye, there has certainly been a learning curve in deciding what to prioritize. Consequently, I haven’t gotten the chance to be as involved in the South Asian or Indian cultural organizations on campus as I had hoped, despite previously assuming these cultural organizations would play a significant role in my college experience.
I have always been connected to my Indian heritage, but not in the same way as some of my peers. Growing up in the Bay Area, there was never a shortage of Indian restaurants, Indian people or movie theaters playing Bollywood movies. My parents were very intentional in preserving our cultural roots while I was growing up. For example, we threw Diwali parties and I had a wardrobe full of Indian clothes. But unlike a lot of my classmates here at USC who also grew up in the Bay Area, I attended a school that was predominantly white. I spent half of my school years living in Palo Alto, not considered one of the many Asian “hubs” housed in the Bay Area. Unlike schools in the Bay, New Jersey or even parts of Los Angeles, we didn’t have sweet 16 parties where everyone, Indian or otherwise, wore sarees and lenghas. I didn’t have an Indian club at my school that put on a huge culture show and not everyone in my class was a talented Bollywood dancer.
South Asian culture was entrenched in their school life in a way that it wasn’t in mine. That might explain why I felt a disconnect when I came to USC — I was used to keeping my cultural heritage separate from my school, even if both were incredibly important to me.

When I think about what anchored me most to my “Indianness,” it would be my experience doing Indian classical singing. From second grade to my senior year of high school, I spent every Saturday morning driving 30 minutes to San Jose to be trained in Hindustani classical music. Those three hours of rigorous class, supplemented by competitions, recitals and practice, made me feel closer to India than anything else I had experienced. I was taught how to greet elders, pronounce Hindi and learned Sanskrit words properly as well as the stories and myths behind the songs that we were taught. I immediately felt a connection with family members and friends who had spent their childhood learning classical music or picking up old Bollywood songs. As I got older, I began to recognize differences between Indian and American cultural values, contrasting the educational styles and priorities of the two systems. Apart from the cultural aspects, singing taught me discipline, perseverance and commitment — probably more so than anything else in my life to date.  It became my most important extracurricular activity, though it still remained somewhat separate from the rest of my life. Many of my friends didn’t know that I studied Indian classical singing so seriously, and only a few have heard me sing. 
Over the last few years, I’ve considered whether I should be doing more by getting involved in cultural student organizations. My friends at other schools have found their homes on campus in the South Asian community, and I wonder if I am doing something wrong. 
Through my experiences on and off campus, I’ve realized that my connection to my culture is shaped by choices that I get to make. Anyone who knows me knows that I love my Indian culture and it is an important part of who I am.  I am allowed to appreciate my culture and feel connected to it in ways that feel right for me, whether it be through enjoying an Indian meal with my South Asian friends, bonding over Bollywood movies or getting dressed up in a lengha once in a while. 
I may not be the one dancing on the stage to Hindi songs, but I certainly appreciate seeing them on the screen, and understand what they mean to my identity.

The Trojans improved their record to 12-9 after their midweek 3-1 victory against Cal State Fullerton on Tuesday. Coming into that game, the Trojans were desperate for a win, having lost their previous four games in miserable fashion.

“The offense going out and putting up a three-spot in the first was big,” sophomore pitcher Austin Manning said to to USC Athletics. “It being my first start of the year, there were obviously a few nerves, but them doing that helped me just focus on going out there and doing my job.”
Now, USC turns its attention to Washington for a weekend series. The Huskies are currently tied for fourth place in the Pac-12 with an 11-10 overall record on the year and a 4-2 conference record. The Trojans, meanwhile, are tied for sixth in the conference despite posting a better overall record than the Huskies. 
Furthermore, after their most recent victory against the NCAA’s top ranked team in the country, Oregon State, the Huskies are entering this game with a ton of momentum. After losing their first two games in their series against the Beavers, the Huskies ended the Beavers’ 15-game winning streak in the third game with an impressive 8-4 victory. 
“I’m just happy for our guys,” Washington coach Lindsay Meggs said to University of Washington Athletics. “We’re a little beat up and we were short-handed today. That is a great team, so this is a good win for us.” 
On paper, this should be a pretty evenly matched series. Both the Trojans and Huskies post similar batting averages — .240 and .252, respectively — and a similar on-base percentage; the Trojans’ .336 just shy of the Huskies’ .340. However, the Huskies do have a slight advantage in ERA compared to the Trojans. As freshman pitcher Kyle Hurt and company proved in their no-hitter against Utah earlier in the season, the Trojans’ pitching staff is capable of rising up to the occasion. 
Junior shortstop Chase Bushor is a player to watch in this series for the Trojans. After freshman shortstop Ben Ramirez sustained injuries, Bushor has stepped in and made an instant impact on this Trojan offense. He currently bats .317 on the season and has looked equally impressive in the field. Meanwhile, junior Mason Cerrillo is the player to watch for the Huskies in this series. On the year, he’s batting an impressive .393 in 56 at bats.
The Trojans took Thursday’s series opener 1-0 courtesy of a go-ahead solo shot by redshirt junior third baseman Angelo Armenta in the eighth inning. 
“It felt good [to hit the homerun]. I was just trying to stay inside the ball and get a good piece so it felt nice,” Armenta said after the game. “It was a good win on Tuesday, and it was just important to get back on track and keep playing good baseball.”
Heading into the game, Armenta was batting .220 on the season with 4 RBI’s to his name. He batted ninth in the lineup, and Hubbs seemed satisfied with his performance and the depth of his lineup after the game.
“[His homerun] was big,” said Hubbs. “He’s been scuffling a little bit, but he’s been starting to swing a little bit better. Hopefully it’s a good sign to come.”
The Trojans pitched a shutout in Thursday night’s game as freshman pitcher Kyle Hurt pitched seven innings, allowing no runs on only three hits. He looked in control for most of the game, throwing eight strikeouts on the day.
“As poorly as we pitched the past week and half that’s how well we pitched the first two games this week,” Hubbs said. “I’m pleased I thought Kyle was strong for seven innings. His first time on short rest.”
After Thursday night’s victory, the Trojans improved their record to 13-9 on the season and 3-4 in the Pac-12. The next game will take place on Friday night at 6 p.m. and the following game will be a game on Saturday at 2 p.m. Both games will take place at Dedeaux Field.

The USC football team held their eighth practice on Thursday, with the team focusing on defense and special teams work as the quarterback competition raged on.
Defense makes progress 
Defensive Coordinator Clancy Pendergast hosted a series of defensive and special teams drills during practice. 
Redshirt senior Ajene Harris participated in an array of cornerback drills. He provided excellent man-on-man coverage. 
“You just gotta love Ajene cause he got a heart of a lion,” Pendergast said. “He takes on every single challenge … You wish you had 11 guys like him.”
Pendergast also highlighted Harris’ leadership abilities over the last few seasons. 
“When you stand around and eavesdrop on Ajene’s conversation with a nickelback or with a corner, he’s speaking the same language that we are as coaches,” Pendergast said. “That’s fun to hear as a coach.”

Senior linebacker Cameron Smith, who elected to return for his senior season, continued to be a vocal presence during drills, creating pressure and causing plenty of disruptions for the offense. 
“I’m seeing things a lot faster,” said Smith. “I’ve worked really hard all offseason. Three years in a defense, I couldn’t ask for a better thing.”
Still, Smith sees a need for improvement in his defensive game, particularly with some routes, pass rush and placement.
 “That’s some of [the]things that I think that my game has always needed improvement since freshman [year] of high school,” Smith said. “It’s something I always want to better at.”
Even with the need for improvement, Smith has seen the defense truly come together during the spring with nearly five months until the first game. 
“We’ve moved on from the 11 guys that can play,” Smith said. “We are working out 22 guys that know our defense, can play and we trust … We all work really well together.”
Quarterback Competition 
Redshirt freshman Jack Sears and redshirt sophomore Matt Fink continued to showcase their offensive prowess in multiple drills during practice. 
Redshirt sophomore Holden Thomas has not been the focus of the competition to fill the void left behind by departing quarterback Sam Darnold, but he had his moments during Thursday’s practice. A high point for Holden came when he connected with sophomore tight end Josh Falo on a deep play in one segment of practice to the adulation of teammates and coaches. 
Sears continued to work and made some quick throws, but fizzled out late and missed key targets. 
Still, it was Fink who continued to showcase his maturity, poise and accuracy. In one segment, Fink threaded the needle to connect with redshirt sophomore wide receiver Trevon Sidney in between double coverage. In another instance Fink connected with redshirt sophomore wideout Velus Jones, Jr. on a deep route. 
Injuries
Junior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. continued easing into his return to practice by participating in an array of positional drills and route running. 
Redshirt freshman defensive lineman Marlon Tuipulotu once again worked separately from the team at the onset of practice as he recovers from a back injury. Cornerbacks redshirt junior Dominic Davis (he also plays running back) and redshirt freshman Je’Quari Godfrey were not in pads. 
Additional Notes
USC alum and current linebacker for the Los Angeles Chargers Hayes Pullard attended practice. Incoming freshman quarterback JT Daniels also visited. Daniels will contend for the vacant quarterback spot after reclassifying and choosing to graduate a year early. He is set to enroll in the fall.

Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
As the cliché goes, hope springs eternal on Opening Day, when every team believes — or at least hopes — that this is its year. But in Los Angeles, the start of the new baseball season brings as much desperation as optimism.
Star pitcher  Clayton Kershaw and company came within one win of a World Series title last fall. But they fell short in Game 7, continuing the franchise’s championship drought that has now spanned a full three decades.
Thirty seasons doesn’t match the futility of the Cleveland Indians’ 69-year streak — still, L.A. won its last ring in 1988: just two years after the New York Mets’ most recent title. Only sustained competitiveness has spared the Dodgers from the ridicule the Mets receive almost every season, but when push comes to shove, it has been an almost equally long time since the Commissioner’s Trophy was in Chavez Ravine and Queens.
Fortunately for L.A. fans, it really does feel like the end of the drought is imminent: Dave Roberts’ squad enters 2018 as the defending National League champion coming off a 104-win campaign. The Dodgers boast a roster full of players entering or in the thick of their prime. Reigning Rookie of the Year first baseman Cody Bellinger is one of many studs in a stacked lineup, while perennial Cy Young/MVP contender Kershaw headlines an equally strong rotation. Oh, and Kenley Jansen — likely the best closer in the league — anchors the bullpen.
On the other hand, it’s easy to forget in retrospect how unlikely last year’s run to the Fall Classic really was. OK, I guess you can’t call it “unlikely” when the franchise with the highest payroll in baseball (by $30 million) wins a pennant. But I’m sure plenty remember the state of the Dodgers the day Bellinger made his big-league debut. About a month into the season, L.A. was floundering below .500 with an impotent offense — then the rookie sensation kick-started his team to the best record in the majors.
Now the Dodgers need Bellinger to avoid a sophomore slump and continue blossoming into one of the game’s top power hitters. Likewise, they will hope Chris Taylor isn’t a flash in the pan. Roberts got 22 home runs and 17 stolen bases from the utilityman, who had batted .230 in 120 career games across three seasons before hitting .288 in 140 contests last year. Matt Kemp is the team’s opening-day left fielder, and it remains to be seen how the 33-year-old will perform in his second go-around with L.A. after being unceremoniously dealt to San Diego in a salary dump in 2014.
There are question marks in the pitching staff, too, mostly due to personnel turnover. Yu Darvish’s rough World Series was a bitter final memory, but he was a valuable asset down the stretch in 2017 and will be missed after penning a deal with the Chicago Cubs. The bridge to Jansen got weaker over the offseason as well: Brandon Morrow also jumped ship to the Cubs in pursuit of a closing gig, and Tony Watson signed with the archrival Giants. The Dodgers acquired southpaw Scott Alexander from Kansas City to help fill the void, but they will largely lean on the likes of Josh Fields and Tony Cingrani to step into bigger roles this season.
None of these problems sre insurmountable. And no team in the league is without weakness and uncertainty. L.A.’s depth was one of its greatest strengths in 2017, and that will undoubtedly roll over to pay dividends in 2018. Another deep postseason run seems a near certainty, but in baseball, you can never be sure of anything.
That makes capitalizing on the Dodgers’ current rise all the more important. Though it appears as if Bellinger and shortstop Corey Seager will make up the franchise’s core for many years to come, it’s hard to imagine a title run becoming more likely once Kershaw hangs up his spikes. 
Going into his age-30 season, the ace isn’t anywhere near retirement, but he is entering the twilight of his prime. Right now, Kershaw can single-handedly compensate for a host of issues in the offense, starting rotation and bullpen, and most importantly, it seems like he has exorcised his postseason demons, making him even more invisible than he already was.
Last October proved that L.A.’s championship window is open wider than it has been in decades. Though they couldn’t quite win it all then, the Dodgers can’t pity themselves for the blown leads in Game 2 and Game 5. The only way to erase those memories is to return to the Fall Classic and go one better. But a sense of urgency is imperative: The window can shut as abruptly as it flies open — just ask the Mets.

A panel of international students from Canada, China, Pakistan, Ghana, the United Kingdom and Ukraine shared their perspectives Thursday on how their home countries’ governments have perceived President Donald Trump’s first year in office. The event, which was hosted by the Office of International Services, took place in the fishbowl of the University Religious Center. Attendees were offered free catered lunch.
(Left to right) Several international graduate students, including Kwabena Gyimah-Asante, Vik Nguyen and Christie Chapman, spoke at the “Trump’s First Year” Panel on Thursday. Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan
Robert English, an associate international relations professor, moderated the event and covered topics such as political polarization, an increase in racial intolerance and violence, foreign policy and nationalistic attitudes.
The panelists were all current or former international students from across different majors. Sarah Riaz, a graduate student from Pakistan studying computer science in the Viterbi School of Engineering, spoke passionately against the Trump administration’s travel ban and rhetoric against Middle East immigration. She cited this as proof for the United States’ need for better foreign policy. 
“All of us are part of a global community, we need to work together to promote global good,” Riaz said. 
However, some panelists explained that their countries’ governments and citizenries were more optimistic about Trump’s first year in office. Kwabena Gyimah-Asante, who was born and raised in Accra, Ghana, moved to the United States in 2012 to begin his undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Now, he is a graduate student studying petroleum engineering and finance at USC.
“From a governmental point of view, I think [Ghana] views it with cautious optimism, the reason being that historically, we’ve had a lot of economic relationships with the Republican political party here in the United States, so we’ve built a lot of economic relationships and investments in infrastructure and so forth, [which] have come under Republican parties,” Gyimah-Asante said. 
Vik Nguyen, an undergraduate senior studying history, lived in both Russia and Ukraine in the past.
 “A lot of what is associated with Republicans and with Donald Trump didn’t matter to [Russia and Ukraine], so things like his stance on immigration, his stance on conservative values … it doesn’t matter because Ukraine and Russia actually share most of those views,” Nguyen said.
Christie Chapman, a graduate student studying global communication, pushed back against some countries’ more lenient stances on Trump’s presidency. 
Chapman, speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom, emphasized the important parallel between Trump’s election and Brexit, and the growing concern of British urban youth in this push toward conservatism. 
“We see our prime ministers and leaders as the people who shape ideology,” Chapman said. “I think in terms of Trump’s views on diversity and immigration and even women’s rights, I can’t understand how people can think that that’s not a prevalent issue, and how action is more important than what he presents himself as as a person. I think if you are a world leader you have to represent the values of your country.”

Rodrigo Riveros, a graduate student studying psychology, thinks access to artistic platforms and organizations should not be a luxury but rather are necessary for positive development in local communities. 
The nonprofit organization Sages and Seekers connects adolescent “Seekers” to senior citizen “Sages” for interaction, conversation and storytelling. Photo courtesy of Sages and Seekers.
“What the arts do so beautifully is actually provide you with the opportunity to think about yourself, your surroundings and how to make your society better,” Riveros said.
Riveros, a research assistant at the USC Brain and Creativity Institute, oversees an eight-week program in Los Angeles under the nonprofit Sages and Seekers. The organization promotes the art of conversation and storytelling by connecting adolescents, or “Seekers,” with senior citizens, the “Sages,” to address ageism in local communities.
Sages and Seekers is one of three projects partnered with USC that is funded by the National Endowment for the Arts in the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to NEA documents. At least 100 arts organizations and institutions in Los Angeles, including USC’s various research labs, have received grants from the NEA to further their missions.
The nonprofit was awarded $90,000 last year to aid in the yearlong study of the program of which Riveros is a part. Mary Helen Immordino-Yang, a professor at the Rossier School of Education, and Elly Katz, the Sages and Seekers founder, applied and received an NEA Research: Art Works grant, which supports research that investigates the value and impact of the arts.
But programs like Sages and Seekers are currently facing an uncertain future, as they could be receiving less funding from NEA after President Donald Trump’s administration announced its 2019 budget proposal in February. For the second consecutive year, the administration’s budget proposal plans to decrease NEA funding by more than 80 percent, from $150 million to $29 million. The NEA’s 2017 funding represented .004 percent of the federal budget. Since the Sages and Seekers’ research grant is slated from May 2017 to August of this year, the nonprofit is in the clear for now, but its future could still be at risk. Organizations that solely or heavily rely on NEA money may be at risk when applying for funding in the next fiscal year. 
“Conversation is the cornerstone of humanity,” Katz said. “If we’ve lost the art of conversation, then we’re going to be in big trouble.” 
Like Riveros, Immordino-Yang noted how arts funding is crucial to education, and the arts should not be viewed merely as a luxury.
“People think of the arts as kind of a luxury that happens after you do your basic learning, but that’s not how the human mind works,” she said. “People need to have ways to express themselves and they need to engage with other people in meaningful ways.”
NEA funding will lead to research that allows Sages and Seekers to present quantifiable data on the impact of guided social conversations to other foundations when applying for future funding. The nonprofit  is currently raising funds to cover expenses not included in the grant through online donations. The program hopes to spread across the country to various communities through high school or college curricula, Katz said. 
“It’s really important especially in adolescents and in old age that people find a way to tell their own story in a way that pushes their life forward purposefully,” said Immordino-Yang, referring to the program’s purpose and the study’s goal in identifying those outcomes.
Riveros emphasized that the goal of art should not merely be aesthetic pleasure, but the promotion of positive human development translating into moral well-being. He said that while conversations are so intuitive and inexpensive, Sages and Seekers’ demonstrates how the power of conversation is critical to community involvement.
“We have to stop cutting funding for the arts when schools are struggling and find more resources to help people have instruction in various media that allow them to express themselves,” Immordino-Yang said. “This is every bit as important as learning math or learning to read.”

Across campus, the University Wi-Fi networks USC Secure Wireless and USC Guest Wireless have endured connectivity problems for students and faculty. 
According to the Information Technology Services, students and faculty members have reported difficulty logging onto the network, slow connection speeds and delayed productivity of applications.
Chief Information Officer Douglas Shook sent out an email to students Thursday addressing the recent wireless performance issues. 
On Tuesday, a reboot of the wireless system was attempted at 4 a.m. with a software patch per the recommendation of the University’s wireless system manufacturer Aruba Networks. The patch did not resolve the problem and the system was not fully restored to the backup wireless controllers until 11:40 a.m. 
According to David Galassi, the assistant Chief Information Officer, the persisting underlying issue is that when the network is unusually busy, some devices cannot get IP addresses. This results in some computers that are unable to access the wireless network.
Along with its occasional inability for devices to get IP addresses, Shook outlined the upcoming efforts of ITS to address other concerns students have had about the network’s productivity.
“We have also had a series of smaller problems over the past few weeks … and we have escalated these problems with the vendor,” Shook said in the email.
Freshman Karl Flores said connectivity issues have affected his own productivity on campus. 
“I was freaking out because I was so confused why [wireless connectivity] is even such a problem if USC prides itself for having all these grand things,” Flores said. “We have a nice film school, we have great security, we have spot-on education. I don’t know why [the Wi-Fi] is such a problem.”
Flores also said that the usage of programs like Google Drive and Blackboard online require a stable wireless connection across the university so students can submit work on time. 
Galassi said ITS is addressing the issues by improving network resiliency.
“We are currently adding additional capacity into buildings,” Galassi said. “We are adding additional coverage in the outdoor spaces, and we are adding extra resiliency to make sure the network is more reliable.” 
In his email, Shook also said that a “Secure Connected USC” initiative would be taking place over the next couple of years to “completely transform” internet security and capability. He said that students may continue to experience issues while wireless services are being moved to a new network. 
“We know that the Wi-Fi service has not lived up to the expectations of the faculty, staff, and students of USC and we [want] to build an infrastructure that is at the level of prestige that USC deserves,” Galassi said.
