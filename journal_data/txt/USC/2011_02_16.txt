Mark R. Benioff, chairman and CEO of Salesforce.com has been named to the USC Board of Trustees and will serve the standard five-year term, overseeing all major university decisions.
Benioff, an ’86 alumnus and member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, has worked in the technology industry since high school.
He worked as a programmer for Apple and at business computing corporation the Oracle before starting Salesforce.com, which supplies business software through subscriptions rather than a one-time payment and downloads.
“[Benioff’s] experience, passion and commitment will be invaluable as we work to secure USC’s undisputed status as an elite global university,” said President C. L. Max Nikias in a press release.
Benioff was named one of the Top 50 People in Business and one of the Smartest People in Tech by Fortune in 2010.
He was also honored as the 2004 Alumni Entrepreneur of the Year by the USC Marshall School of Business.
“I am deeply honored to join the USC Board of Trustees,” Benioff said in the press release. “I look forward to sharing my knowledge of technology, innovation and philanthropy to help the USC community continue to thrive.”

Conservative political commentator and blogger Andrew Breitbart spoke to students in Doheny Library on Wednesday night, in an event hosted by the USC College Republicans, to highlight the differences between liberals and conservatives.
Activism · Andrew Breitbart is the publisher of the blogs BigHollywood, BigPeace, BigGovernment and BigJournalism. He spoke in Doheny Memorial Library Wednesday. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan 
Breitbart said he became interested in politics during his time at Tulane University in the late 1980s. Although he originally held more liberal beliefs during his college years, he gradually shifted his political viewpoints to the right.
“I just found myself naturally entering the conservative power realm. I started to realize and think through some of these things that, wherever the left exists, it tries to shut down dissent,” Breitbart said. “Well, I’m a loudmouth and I don’t want to be shut up, so I didn’t like this.”
Many view Breitbart as a strict Republican, but he said he is just focused on improving society.
“I’m not as political as people think I am,” he said. “I simply care about changing our culture and neutralizing the pernicious influence that the left has on society. They control the megaphone.”
Rosemary Meyerott, a junior majoring in business administration, is a new member to the College Republicans who said she wanted to see what Breitbart had to say to USC students.
“I wanted to know what he had to share specifically with college students and how his beliefs operate in the university setting,” Meyerott said.
Breitbart said he has found that liberals have control over cultural institutions, including Hollywood and American universities, because conservatives have a hard time expressing their viewpoints.
He said many of his acquaintances in the entertainment industry, ranging from models to directors to comedians, would tell him about their conservative views, but keep them private for fear of not getting hired.
Breitbart said he thinks university professors also hide their true political beliefs for fear of not being able to receive tenure.
“Everywhere that I go that reflects the cultural vanguard whether it be USC or Hollywood or the offices of The New York Times you see the same traits of leftist intolerance to other ideas and those ideas reflect a great majority of the American people,” Breitbart said.
Breitbart delineated the different definitions of tolerance between those on the left and those on the right.
“[The left’s] definition of tolerance is that if you disagree with the proper progressive position of what something is, that’s intolerance,” he said. “You’re living in their little matrix of political correctness where they’re saying if you disagree with us, we’re going to shut you down and call you an ‘ist’ — a racist, a sexist and so on.”
Anjali Naskar, a junior majoring in international relations (global business), said she often feels intimidated to speak up in class about her Republican views.
“I know that in my classes, I’m scared to speak up because I’m afraid my more liberal professors will throw my beliefs in my face,” Naskar said. “There could be more Republicans in my class, but I wouldn’t really ever know. But Breitbart’s speech got me inspired, so now I’m thinking that I might speak up more about my political views.”
Breitbart is the publisher of the news portals Breitbart.com and Breitbart.tv and the blogs BigHollywood, BigGovernment, BigJournalism and BigPeace. His new book, Righteous Indignation: Excuse Me While I Save the World, will be published later this spring.
Strange that the article never mentions Breitbart’s slander of Shirley Sherrod, the shameful episode he is best known for (although there are others). It also would have been nice to quote someone who doesn’t agree with him.
Andrew Breitbart released that video of Shirley Sherrod at a time when the NAACP was condemning the Tea Party for being racist. That video showed Sherrod making racist statements to the NAACP. What the video showed was the NAACP members in the audience embracing the remarks by Sherrod. Rank hypocrisy. Andrew Breitbart had no intention of causing Sherrod to lose her job, or control over the White House and Tom Vilsak for firing her. Get your facts straight Max.
Wrong RebelPundit – Mr. Breitbart presented an edited version of Ms. Sherrod’s statements to falsely make it appear that she was a racist by harming a white farmer when she worked for the USDA. In fact she said that she had to examine her own racial attitudes and concluded that poverty, not race was the limiting factor in rural development and went on to help the farmer. As for the white farmer in question, she went all out to help him keep his farm 20 years ago and he and Ms. Sherrod became friends. Mr. Briebart claims he didn’t edit Mr. Sherrod’s speech and yet the edited version he presented as the truth is exactly opposite from the actual facts. It’s too easy to use modern editing technologies to present falsehoods and that’s exactly what Mr. Breitbart presented about Ms. Sherrod. Whether he did the editing himself or not isn’t relevant to the damage the false video caused to Ms. Sherrod.
Although I completely disagree with Mr. Breitbart’s political convictions and find many of his assertions to be unfounded, it is not his ideology that is the basis of why I don’t think it was appropriate for Mr. Breitbart to speak on campus. Last summer Mr. Breitbart’s misrepresentation of Shirley Sherrod on his website that caused her firing was a despicable act that showed him to have no integrity. He has no place speaking at USC as he does not align with the university’s values of honesty and intellectualism. I hope the college Republicans choose more wisely when asking people to campus in the future, I certainly hope they don’t believe Mr. Breitbart reflects their values either.

Five years after the Department of Public Safety created the Silent Witness program, the number of tips per month has not increased, according to DPS officials.
The Silent Witness program is a reporting system on the DPS website that allows students to report criminal activity anonymously.
As the program itself doesn’t require much funding, if any at all, DPS is not upset that the program is generating only one tip per week. DPS Detective Josh Voyda said, however, that DPS’s goal has been to increase the number of incidents reported to them.
“We can’t do anything about incidents if we don’t know about them,” Voyda said. “We want to provide a way for people to tell us about things when they are concerned about their identity being discovered.”
Christen Lazarcheck, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism, said she was verbally harassed last week while riding her bike on the sidewalk.
She said if she had known about the Silent Witness program, she would have been more likely to report the incident because of its close proximity to campus.
“I wouldn’t go up to a DPS person in person,” Lazarcheck said. “I’d report it online, anonymously, telling that someone just cussed me out just for DPS to be aware.”
Some students say they are not even aware the program exists.
“It really isn’t talked about, I’ve never heard the name before,” said Bess Benhamou, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “It’s not like we have to put a lot of money into the program, but then again there’s not much point of having it if no one really knows about it.”
When the program first began, Voyda said there were some efforts to raise awareness. He said he is unsure if it has continued since, however.
“Initially when it came out, there was some promotion on it and it was very prominently featured on the DPS webpage,” Voyda said. “However, there is a constant turnover in the population of USC.”
Alexa Mateen, an undeclared sophomore, said she believes students would utilize the Silent Witness program if they knew about it.
“I’m not sure why DPS hasn’t informed us, but they should try to inform the students through e-mail or on campus,” Mateen said. “If kids hear about this they would probably use it to their advantage.”
According to Voyda, the most common crimes reported through the Silent Witness program are suspicious activity and people loitering in unusual places. He said, however, that there have been some instances of students using this program inappropriately.
“Silent Witness is not a way to report a crime in progress or a loud party that needs immediate attention,” Voyda said. “We often come in on Monday morning and find that a tip was submitted on Saturday night about someone trying doors or tampering with bicycle locks.”
Whether much of the USC community knows about the program is questionable, but Voyda said he thinks the program would be more frequently used if more people knew about it.
“I know that there are a good number of people that are aware of it, enough of them that do send us stuff,” Voyda said. “But I don’t know how many of them are simply browsing the DPS website or if they came to the website knowing it was there.”
Voyda said DPS puts out a lot of information to the community so they do not plan to use other publicity measures to promote the program.
“It seems that people find it. When people start looking for ways to contact us and they come to the website, they tend to come across that as a possible way to report something,” Voyda said. “It’s mentioned on the bottom of every crime alert so hopefully if people are reading it, that’s how they can find out about the program.”
Kristin Yinger, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism, said that although she doesn’t necessarily feel unsafe on campus, she felt the program would get more usage if students were familiar with it.
“If I were further from campus, past The Row, I would definitely use it on the Portland or Adam areas,” Yinger said. “If I felt unsafe and knew about this, I would use the program.”
Another program that enables students to report crime or suspicious behavior anonymously is the USC Trojans Care for Trojans program. Students can text 274637 with “TC4T,” a description of the situation and the location in the text. The number is blocked from DPS officials, so everything is completely anonymous.
Although the TC4T program is a more immediate approach than the Silent Witness program, Voyda said the online approach is more effective.
“The Silent Witness Program is the most effective way to receive the information anonymously because it has been around longer,” Voyda said. “You can put more information into the Silent Witness form than you can into a text message. If you want to fully explain a problem, you can do so more explicitly than with a text message.”
Crime tips should go to DPS dispatchers 24/7 so they can triage the situation and determine if a crime in progress requires immediate response.  The fact that a DPS Detective can state “We often come in on Monday morning and find that a tip was submitted on Saturday night about someone trying doors or tampering with bicycle locks” shows DPS leadership is not serious about the tip line.  If that is the case, it should be discontinued and the USC community should be informed of that.  Sounds like it will take a negligence lawsuit to wake them up to their irresponsibility.
Joe,
First off, it’s not a tip line.  It’s a submission form on a website.  Second, it’s there in bold red letters on the website that it’s not for emergencies.  If you use it to try to report an emergency, you are the negligent party. 
Are you just looking for something to complain about?

This week’s series of Sex Week events, sponsored by the USC Program Board, raises the question of whether USC provides adequate sexual health resources to students during the other 51 weeks of the year.
Victim · Derrick Burts, a former adult film actor, shared his views on reform in the Adult Entertainment Industry during Sex Week at USC. - Christopher Pham | Daily Trojan 
The answer to this question is located on the second floor of the University Health Center in the Health Promotion and Prevention Services center.
The majority of students that visit HPPS come for the free safe-sex supplies, specifically condoms, and HIV testing, which are free during the month of February, according to Christina Li, an HPPS employee.
“We like people to come in and talk individually,” said HPPS director Paula Swinford. “But a lot of the work that we do is making sure that the conversations around sexuality happen where the student is, and making an environment that supports risk reduction and protective behaviors.”
Li said she believes students should take more advantage of HPPS’ one-on-one resources, and worries that many students might not know they exist.
“HPPS doesn’t publicize that you can come and talk about sex,” Li said. “They only publicize that you can come and get HIV testing and that there are condoms.”
The center also offers counseling and a Resource Room where students can read up on sexual health and speak to peer health educators, who have been trained to talk anonymously with students about sex and other health-related issues.
Though more students visit HPPS for condoms and testing than to talk, Li said this does not mean students aren’t taking full advantage of HPPS, whose main goal is universal prevention rather than individual intervention.
These efforts include activities like filling condom buckets campus-wide and training resident advisers to be able to have discussions about sexuality with their residents.
Catherine Chan, a freshman peer health educator, said she wishes more students would utilize HPPS’ Resource Room, she also thinks there should be more programming on campus like Sex Week.
“Most people think they’re going to get judged for talking about [sex],” Chan said. “That’s why I think programs like Sex Week are good because people can just bring their friends, and it’s not a judgment call.”
Cerise Carleo, a freshman majoring in architecture, said Sex Week is a chance to challenge students’ perceptions of sexual health.
“[Sexual health education] is still an issue here because everyone has grown up with different backgrounds,” Carleo said. “I also don’t think that it should stop at a certain age. I think you just end up having more questions the more you’re exposed to.”
Emilia Ana Cosma, executive director of Program Board’s Women’s Student Assembly, decided to bring Sex Week to USC because she believes that although the health center has a lot of available resources, USC still lacks  programming related to sexuality.
“[Sex Week] is a great way to talk about issues like safe sex, HIV/AIDS prevention, STD prevention as well as a lot of related gender and relationship issues,” Cosma said. “But it frames things in a more palatable way to educate people.”
Some of these issues will be discussed tonight at 7 p.m. in THH 119 at a workshop with the WSA and the Center for Women titled “Healthy Sex is Good Sex: Navigating the World of Hook-ups and Dating Violence.”
“We’ve tried to make it as applicable to a wide variety of students as possible, not only focusing on people who are in relationships,” Cosma said. “But also on people who are dating and just hanging out on The Row and talking about ways to avoid the different things that come up in a real open and honest forum.”

Named to Baseball America’s Preseason All-American first team, Ricky Oropesa will help lead the USC baseball team in its 2011 season. The Daily Trojan sat down with Oropesa to discuss his thoughts and goals for this season. The Trojans will start their season Friday against Missouri.
Rick Oropesa - Daily Trojan
Daily Trojan: First off, congratulations on the Baseball America Preseason All-America first team. How significant is that award to you?
Ricky Oropesa: Obviously it’s a really big accomplishment, I’ve been trying to get better. I don’t think I’ve been recognized first-team All-American preseason before, I got second team and stuff like that. But it’s showing that I’m improving and I’m doing better, so it’s a real honor.
DT: Tell me about when you were drafted by the Red Sox in 2008. What were the factors that went into the decision to stay?
Oropesa: There were a lot of factors that went into that decision. And one of them was where I got placed in the draft.
Not knowing where I would be falling into the draft really played a role because I really wanted to go to USC. [Former USC] coach [Chad] Kreuter, the staff, the full scholarship — it’s hard to pass up.
Getting a USC degree after getting drafted this year was most important to me so it was a big decision. The Yankee fan in me didn’t really play a role, I like the Red Sox, the organization is great. It’d be funny to see if they draft me again this year.
DT: Was USC on your mind before the draft? Had you already said if you didn’t go high enough, this is where you were going to go, or were you choosing between a couple schools?
Oropesa: There were some choices I got, like every other Pac-10 school and some East coast schools. But I let it be known that I was going to USC if I didn’t get what I wanted or if I wasn’t placed high enough.
DT: So your first year and last year was with [Chad] Kreuter and now you have [new USC coach]Frank Cruz. How has it been different?
Oropesa: Both coaches — I have so much respect for them. They’re just two different coaches. Their approach to the game.
Coach Kreuter is more of a hands-on guy with players, and coach Cruz is more of a vocal leader, more of a guy that really takes people and kind of sets the mood, as in he doesn’t put up with BS, pretty much. He’s a hard-nosed guy.
Coach Kreuter is kind of laid back, that pro coach mentality, if you get it done, it’s on your own. But coach Cruz, he really forces it down on you.
DT: Is it helpful for you to have both sides of coaching while being in college?
Oropesa: Definitely. As we move on to the next level you’re going to see that type of mentality that coach Kreuter had but it’s nice to see what coach Cruz has and I think he’s done great so far. I’m really excited to see what he has for us and to see our work put in to the season.
DT: How are the guys responding to Cruz?
Oropesa: The guys like coach Cruz a lot, even though some don’t because of his strict policies and that’s just part of the game, part of being a student-athlete here. He has strict rules. If you miss class, you miss tutoring, you’re going to be throwing up at 4 o’clock in the morning because you’re going to be running so much, but I think that’s what’s supposed to be done. He has a saying that ‘You’re going to hate me now, but you’re going to love me later,’ and I think that’s his way.
DT: What’s your long term goal?
Oropesa: The hardest part is to go out there every day and just playing your best. You can’t really ask for more. You want to do everything you can out there to win but winning is not the most important thing.
The most important thing is to just go out there and do everything you can to win.

Former USC quarterback Mark Sanchez will receive the inaugural Young Alumni Merit Award at the annual USC Alumni Awards on April 30.
As a member of USC’s Rose Bowl championship teams from 2007 to 2009, the 6-foot-3, 225-pound quarterback was voted the 2009 Rose Bowl Offensive Most Valuable Player.
“Mark Sanchez is a brilliant athlete and a dedicated Trojan,” said USC Alumni Association CEO Scott Mory in a press release. “We are proud to present him with our inaugural Young Alumni Merit Award.”
After being selected fifth overall in the 2009 NFL Draft by the New York Jets, the Long Beach native became the first rookie quarterback in the NFL to win his first five games as a starter.
Sanchez has also won more road playoff games in NFL history than any other quarterback. This year marked his second season in the NFL.
With a career total of 41 touchdowns and 3,965 yards with USC, Sanchez earned the merit award based on his leadership through his years with the team.
While playing for the Trojans, Sanchez earned the starting quarterback position as a junior in 2008 and started three times in 2007. He redshirted his freshman year in 2005.
The USC Alumni Association has been recognizing distinguished members of the Trojan family since 1932. The Young Alumni Merit Award was established in 2010, and will be honoring recipients for the first time this year.
In addition to Sanchez, nine other Trojans will be recognized in April for their accomplishments and contributions to USC.
“Sanchez has also won more road playoff games in NFL history than any other quarterback.”
Sanchez actually shares the record (4 wins) with Len Dawson, Roger Staubach, Jake Delhomme, and Joe Flacco.

The USC men’s volleyball team is looking to rebound from its first loss of the season against Pepperdine as it returns home to the Galen Center after a five-game match trip.
Bounce back · Senior outside hitter Tri Bourne looks to lead USC to victory as it hosts defending national champion Stanford tonight. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
The Trojans (6-1, 6-1) were close to beginning their season 7-0 for the first time since 1991, but then-No. 11 Pepperdine managed to eke out a victory in five sets on Friday.
In the losing effort, senior opposite Murphy Troy did finish with a season-best 29 kills and broke Juan Figueroa’s old kill record in the rally-scoring era in the process.
“It’s cool,” Troy said. “But there are a lot of greats that came before the rally scoring era. It’s definitely cool to pass that mark, but I have to take it for what it is.”
The Trojans were without senior middle blocker Austin Zahn, who sprained his ankle in practice during the week.
He is expected to be available for tonight’s match against No. 4 Stanford.
USC hit a season-low .292 for the match against Pepperdine, while the Waves hit .550 and .706 in the closing sets respectively.
“They passed it well and they could run the attack out of the middle,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “It’s going to be tough if they can do that.”
The Trojans have had three full days to regroup after the loss.
“We’re just moving forward and continuing to improve,” Ferguson said. “We’re working on attacking, which was not as good as usual against Pepperdine.”
The Cardinal (9-3, 6-3) were also victims of the disparity in the conference.
They were upset at the hands of unranked UC San Diego at home on Friday in a five-set match as well.
Stanford is also the defending NCAA champion.
“There’s a big rivalry here, and that’s not just because of the level of play,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin. “Many of us — the Hawaiian guys especially — have known the Stanford guys since we were little.”
The Cardinal rely on tough defense and precise passing and are ranked second in the conference after the Trojans in digs per set.
“We have to be patient attacking them,” Ferguson said. “They’ll dig a lot of our hits.”
Although the Trojans were handed their first loss of the season, they have not let it stand in the way of the methodical process they came into the season with.
“We can’t do anything outside of ourselves,” McKibbin said. “The Pepperdine loss was just one mishap. We need to focus on how we usually play, because then we’ll be successful.”
FIGHT ON MEN…..I AM SO PROUD OF THESE ATHLETES AND THEIR COACHES.
Come out to Galen tonight and watch some great action, and a Trojan Victory over the NCAA Champs…
You may even see me dancing on the Jumbo -Tron to fire up the team….lol

Decades ago, the Women of Troy reached the pinnacle of women’s college basketball, winning back-to-back NCAA championships in 1983 and 1984.
Along with those two championships, USC captured five Pac-10 conference titles and appeared in four Final Fours, while also laying claim to some of the best women’s basketball players in the world in Cheryl Miller, Lisa Leslie, Tina Thompson and Cynthia Cooper.
Miller (the older sister of former NBA star Reggie Miller) certainly got her fair share of the family’s basketball genes, as she finished her USC career as the all-time lead scorer and rebounder.
Before becoming an Olympic and WNBA star, Leslie set Pac-10 conference records for scoring, rebounding and blocked shots.
Thompson was a three-time All-American at USC and the first-ever player drafted by the WNBA and is currently the WNBA’s leading scorer.
Cooper ranks eighth all-time on USC’s scoring list and fifth in assists, and helped lead the WNBA’s Houston Comets to four consecutive titles.
Although it might be difficult to live up to the accolades of its predecessors, the USC women’s basketball team did not get the short end of the stick when it comes to talent and the program is on the rise once again.
The Women of Troy (15-8, 7-5) have showed glimpses of their potential, beating then-No. 22 Gonzaga in their home opener, then-No. 17 Georgia and taking then-No. 4 Xavier to the wire on the road.
More importantly, they’ve defended their home court, as they currently boast an 8-2 record at the Galen Center. 
With just six games remaining in conference play and the Pac-10 tournament waiting after the regular season ends, the Women of Troy have a realistic shot at getting to 20 wins, which is the measuring stick for teams looking to punch their ticket to the Big Dance (according to ESPN, USC is currently slated to be a No. 8 seed).
Though a lot of people might not know about the success of the women’s basketball team this year, the Women of Troy have quietly put together a solid showing under second-year USC coach Michael Cooper.
Junior guards Briana Gilbreath and Ashley Corral both entered as freshman in 2008, and now both hold places in the USC record books.
Both also recently surpassed the 1,000-point scoring mark for their careers, becoming the 22nd and 23rd players respectively in USC history, to reach that feat. Corral also became the Women of Troy’s all-time three-point leader.
If not plagued by injuries during her time at USC, redshirt senior guard Jacki Gemelos might very well have put together a career similar to that of some of the greats before her. Heralded as the nation’s No. 1 recruit out of Stockton, Calif., in 2006, her court instincts, ball-handling ability and shooting stroke make her one of the most complete players on the team.
And now, healthy for the first time in her career, Gemelos is averaging just under 12 points per game.
Senior center Kari LaPlante holds down the middle for USC, providing an interior presence that earned her a Pac-10 All-Defensive honorable mention last season.
Sophomore forward Christina Marinacci earned a Pac-10 All-Freshman honorable mention last season and has proven to be a reliable source both starting or coming off the bench.
And to bolster the front line, Cooper brought in freshman forward Cassie Harberts, ranked the No. 2 power forward in the nation out of high school. Harberts is currently the only USC player to start in every contest this year, and has recorded two double-doubles in her young career.
Even former All-American guard Stefanie Gilbreath is finally healthy and has been a welcome addition to the Women of Troy this season.
With a total of six All-Americans on its roster, USC is certainly not lacking in talent, and with a core group that has been together for a couple years, a run to the NCAA tournament this year and consistently into the future is not a far-fetched idea.
Adding to an already talent-laden roster, Cooper has also managed to pull in two ESPN 100 recruits and McDonald’s All-Americans in Alexyz Vaioletama (Fountain Valley, Calif.) and Ariya Crook-Williams (Long Beach, Calif.) for the 2011 season.
Like the all-time greats before them who paved a path of success, the future for USC looks bright.
For a program so used to success, it’s about time that the Women of Troy are back on the rise.
Although we all know their male counterparts have struggled with consistency issues this year and have almost entirely eliminated their chances of dancing in March this season, the Women of Troy might be the ones representing the cardinal and gold at the Big Dance this year and beyond.
Here’s hoping they make it.

Freshman Cassie Harberts has started every game for the women’s basketball team this season — the only player to do so. The San Clemente, Calif. forward averages 9.4 points per game for the Women of Troy. The Daily Trojan sat down with Harberts and asked to share her thoughts on the season and how the team will prepare for what’s to come.
Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan
Daily Trojan: Have you always wanted to go to USC? What other schools did you consider during your recruitment process.
Harberts:  I actually committed previously in my junior year. Then there was a coaching staff change, so I opened myself back up [to other schools]. USC wasn’t my top choice after that, I actually committed to Arizona State first. Then I was like, “Oh I want to go to USC,” so then I de-committed [from Arizona State] and ended up here.
DT: What were your goals coming into the season? Have they been achieved?
Harberts: We wanted to go undefeated at home, and we did that up until our Arizona State and UCLA losses [two weeks ago]. We also wanted to get to the [NCAA] tournament, and we have a really good chance of doing that. So we’re still working toward that one.
DT: What are your biggest accomplishments on and off the court?
Harberts: Probably playing for the under-18 USA team [in high school]. That was a pretty big accomplishment. Off the court … [pauses] Probably just getting [to USC] and doing well in classes so far at USC — it’s a great school.
DT: Did you expect to be in the starting line-up this soon? How do you see your role on the team?
Harberts: I actually didn’t think I would start. I came in wanting to work hard and get some playing time, whether off the bench or starting, it didn’t matter. But to have this success, the belief in my coaching staff has really helped me on the floor. I just see my role as doing anything to help my team win.
DT: What do you think the team has to do to get in the NCAA tournament?
Harberts: We just have to continue the way we have been playing. Against UCLA, we turned a corner in our team mentality. We just can’t lose any more games.
DT: What adjustments have you had to make in the transition from high school to college basketball?
Harberts: Coming into college, all five of us out there are really good players. We’ve all been All-American, we’ve all been on the USA team or whatever. But I think we all work really well together. I’m not looking to score every time. I have a different role now, and I’ve learned that throughout the year.
DT: How has the team grown over the season?
Harberts: I think we’ve grown a lot. Starting off, we were kind of shaky, depending on what team showed up that night. But after the UCLA game, I think we’ve really turned a corner.

As the USC men’s basketball team enters the second half of February with just the faintest of hopes of crashing the Big Dance in March, USC coach Kevin O’Neill understands the importance of simplifying his team’s focus, especially as it travels to the Bay Area, where it hasn’t swept since 1992.
High hopes · After losing six of their last nine games, junior forward Nikola Vucevic and the USC men’s basketball players look to defeat Cal this weekend. Cal bested the Trojans earlier this season at the Galen Center. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“We just need to play every game one at a time,” O’Neill said. “From there we will just see where we end up at the end of the year.”
First up on the Trojans Northern California tour is a stop at Haas Pavilion tonight to take on an equally underperforming opponent in California.
When the Trojans embarked on their Oregon road trip a month ago, the season held a lot of promise.
But from poor perimeter defense to inconsistent guard play and untimely scoring droughts, what has transpired over the last 30 days has turned lofty goals into unfulfilled expectations.
“We are not going to win 18 or 19 games,” O’Neill said. “We’d have to win the rest of them and I don’t know if we’re capable of that.”
To add insult to injury, the Trojans (13-12, 5-7) haven’t won at Berkeley since January 2007 and have struggled mightily on the road during Pac-10 play this season, winning just one game in five contests.
In addition to its road woes, USC has already lost to Cal (13-12, 6-7) this season, back on Jan. 22 when the Bears pulled out a narrow 68-66 victory at the Galen Center.
Despite senior guard Donte Smith’s career-high 24 points on eight three-point baskets in their first meeting, USC could not contain the Bears’ physicality, primarily from junior forward Harper Kamp.
Kamp led California with 19 points (10 of which came in the final seven minutes), but after landing an elbow to the jaw of junior forward Nikola Vucevic in the first half, USC’s interior post presence was essentially nonexistent.
Vucevic — who comes into tonight’s 7:30 p.m. tip-off leading USC with 16.9 points per game and 10.1 rebounds per game, finished the night with just six points, his lowest point total on the Pac-10 season.
Although things remain bleak for the visibly frustrated Trojans with six games to play in their conference schedule plus the upcoming Pac-10 tournament, there is still time to save face in a season slowly fading away.
And if USC can hang its hat on anything that rings of optimism, it has been its performance on Thursday nights.
The Trojans are 4-1 on Thursdays this season, winning by an average of more than 16 points per game.
Also, although the team played from behind for most of their 61-51 loss to Oregon last Saturday at the Galen Center, the backcourt duo of junior Jio Fontan and freshman Maurice Jones finally look as though they are starting to build some chemistry with one another.
In defeat, the two guards combined for a season-high 12 assists — a much-needed boost for USC, who currently sits in last place in the conference with only 12 assists per game.
The Trojans conclude their two-game road trip in Palo Alto, Calif. Saturday night to take on Stanford.
USC’s 65-42 victory over the Cardinal (13-11, 6-7) on Jan. 20 was its largest conference win of the season.

USC commit Steve Dillon has still not signed his letter of intent to play football for the Trojans next fall, according to the Orange County Register.
A source told The Register that academic issues were the primary reason that the defensive end has yet to fax in his letter of intent.
“His commitment is to USC,” the source said. “He has decided to concentrate on his academic work right now to meet the USC academic standard. He will sign when requirements are completed.”
The Palmdale High School star gave his pledge to the Trojans in November and is still considered to be a strong commit despite his academic troubles. Dillon would potentially become the 31st member of USC’s highly touted recruiting class — ranked No. 4 nationally by Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com
In order to be eligible to play in the Fall, Dillon must meet the academic requirements set forth by the NCAA and sign his letter of intent by April 1.

Once part of the economic heart of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Stock Exchange is now making a comeback as a newly transformed dance club and lounge.
Let’s dance · Exchange L.A. blends modern technology with the look of old Los Angeles. The club features a Funktion One system, one of only three in the world, as well as elaborately decorated VIP rooms for rent. - Photo courtesy of Feel Good Nights 
Located in Downtown Los Angeles on Spring Street in the original 1929 Stock Exchange building, Exchange L.A. has become a hot-spot for hipsters, ravers and dancers alike.
Owned partially by Camill Sayadeh, a USC alum and political science major from the class of 1996, Exchange L.A. hopes to draw a larger Trojan crowd to the venue on weekends.
The main dance floor, the “Trading Room,” is a 25,000 square foot space for dancing and mingling. Modernity and old Los Angeles are effortlessly blended; the original 40-foot-high hand-painted, vaulted ceiling lends an authentic quality to the décor, while the $1.5 million spent on lighting and sound alone lend the space a swanky vibe.
This club’s décor is not as original as some (Eden in Hollywood comes to mind), but the lack of glitz allows the building to speak for itself. The space is already extravagant without any extra frills — anything more would be too much.
There are still frills, though, even if they are not over-the-top. The building has undergone a $5 million renovation in the last two years to get it ready for its current nightclub status.
The speakers are all Funktion One brand, one of the most coveted and expensive sound systems in the world, better than the systems at Playhouse, Avalon or any other Hollywood club. In fact, there are only three Funktion One systems in the world. On top of that, Exchange L.A. also boasts state of the art smoke machines, lasers and mirrors placed appropriately around the interior.
Early Friday evening, around 10 p.m., Exchange exuded more of a lounge vibe than a typical club atmosphere. Black leather couches placed in corners on the bottom level and along the walls of the top level, the “Federal Reserve,” allowed for more intimate conversations without having to yell over the music.
Of course, as with any club, the VIP areas receive the most attention and the most desirable locations.
The Sky Loft, overlooking both the Trading Room and Federal Reserve areas of the club, can be rented out for $8,000 per night with bottle service or $15,000 per night for all-you-can-drink service.
The room was designed by one of the owners, Sayadeh, who doubles as a furniture designer, and features handmade glass tables and lamps. Besides being one of the most exclusive spaces in the venue, the room has a whimsical feel, with walls covered in hand-painted masks and miniature parachutes hang from the ceiling.
The bartenders are friendly and the prices are typical of most nightclubs, with beers around $7 and cocktails and mixed drinks starting at $15.
Founder and CEO of promoting company Feel Good Nights George Khalil said the club has been getting great business since renovations were completed.
Friday night was DJed by popular electronic duo The Crystal Method, drawing a larger crowd than normal. The club typically draws anywhere from 600 to 1,700 people each night.
The most interesting thing about Exchange L.A. is the diversity of its large crowd. Everyone from hipsters wearing furry-hooded vests to ravers, sans glow sticks, seemed to be enjoying themselves Friday night. There was even a 70-year-old couple breaking it down on the dance floor and no one seemed to give it a second thought.
Besides serving as one of the hottest new clubs downtown, Exchange L.A. also functions as a space for corporate parties and fashion shows.
Rather than spending money and time figuring out logistics to head to clubs in Hollywood, Sayadeh is hoping to start getting party buses and other student packages to Exchange L.A. for Greek events, or even just normal weekend nights, so students tired of the usual 901 Bar & Grill exploits can have a new place to experience on Friday nights.
Though Exchange L.A. itself is not dramatically different from other clubs, the space’s fusion of old and new aesthetics is reason enough to check it out.

Sharks don’t die quickly after being finned. Once they hit the water, sharks usually sink. It’s hard for the shark to swim without the dorsal fin, which keeps it upright and stable. Immobilized, the shark will either suffocate or suffer death by the jaws of another predator.
Shark finning, the act of harvesting the expensive fin, without directly killing the shark, is no doubt a cruel procedure. Finning is greedy, the point being that isolated fins are easier to transport than entire shark carcasses. It’s also wasteful, as shark meat is perfectly edible.
Most will probably be happy to hear about the shark fin ban proposed Monday in California. Legislators introduced a bill that would ban the possession, sale and distribution of these prized fins, which are used mostly in the luxurious Chinese dish of shark fin soup.
Hawai’i led the way with the shark fin legislature, banning finning last year. Why doesn’t California jump on board?
Well, like everything else in life, the issue isn’t as clear as it seems.
The first snag is that shark finning is already illegal in the United States.
President Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act into law Jan. 4, making it necessary for all sharks to have both fins and carcasses and for the fins to be attached to the sharks they arrive in port.
As for importing shark fins, it’s not possible with the accompanying carcass, thanks to Bill Clinton’s signing of the Shark Finning Prohibition Act of 2000.
So where exactly does the problem lie? It seems the fins used in California are from legitimately fished shark carcasses, not from the cruel practice of shark finning. Why would it make sense to put a full ban on a culturally prized item for which there is a real demand?
“Right now, Costco sells shark steak,” State Sen. Leland Yee told the San Francisco Chronicle. “What are you going to do with the fin from that shark? This is another example in a long line of examples of insensitivity to the culture and traditions of the Asian American community.”
Yee’s chief-of-staff Adam Keigwin agreed, noting that a complete ban would simply hurt small businesses still wishing to operate in a lawful manner.
But Assemblyman Jared Huffman, who helped to introduce the bill, said attacking the problem at the source —  the demand, not the supply — is the way to approach the issue. This is primarily because there aren’t enough officials to regulate practices at the docks.
“[Selling illegal fins] is still fairly ubiquitous despite this nominal ban on the practice of shark finning,” Huffman told Capitol Weekly. “There is a very lucrative market that continues fueling the practice.”
So if we can’t stop illegal shark fin distribution while federal measures are in place, what would allow a ban of shark fins in California to actually work? After all, there’s clearly a lucrative, illegal market at work here. It’s hard to imagine things would change significantly with the ban in place.
Lots of people see shark’s fin as a treasured delicacy, an integral part of celebrations or festive events.  I can’t imagine people would simply give up consuming it without feeling wronged in some way.
There is no quick fix to the issue of sharks and their fins. The problem isn’t shark finning itself, it’s the fact that sharks are being overfished as a whole. Shark populations have declined massively over the last 40 years, with the World Conservation Union noting that some species have declined in number by up to 90 percent.
Maybe a bill that takes the easy road, a full ban of the controversial product at hand, isn’t the best solution to the problem. Would a ban make people want the product any less?
It’s still unclear how much good the ban would do and how much shark sales would decline. As Huffman pointed out, people get what people want and a full ban might just accelerate the sale of shark fins on the black market.
It also seems that there are better options than to simply forbid a community from indulging in what is a cherished food with much tradition behind it. You might not care about shark’s fin soup, but does that mean a bill with uncertain benefits should be hastily passed?
It comes down to who would really be affected by the law. Shark populations might benefit, but if a black market flourishes, the bill might be for naught.
What is definite, however, is that a community of people would lose out, namely small businesses that thrive on the demand for this luxury product.
Innocent animals are easy to sympathize with, but unfamiliar cultures and foods, however are harder to care about. Perhaps the right step forward would be one that patiently takes everyone and everything, not just sharks, into account.

Thank you for this story! An important issue that more students (and people in general) should be aware of and involved in.
Let’s not lie, cultural tradition does not excuse anything…
the factory farming of cows/pigs/chickens is no exception either. 
Take the No Shark Fin Pledge:

It is my choice if I want turkey for thanksgiving.  If I’m Chinese it is my choice to try shark fin soup on a special occasion.
The bill takes away my choice.  If sharks are endangered then put the sharks on the endangered list.  If they are not endangered why not?  Shark is like any other fish in the sea.  Why make this bill instead of lobbying fish&game to ban all consumption of sharks?  If you chose just fins then you “are” targeting only Chinese.  Make a ban on all sharks then that’s being objective.
As for chinese feet binding.  It was meant as a way to make a girl seem more feminine and elegant to have small feet.  Look around you!  Girls do alot more crazy things for the price of beauty (guys too).  They have nose jobs, boob implants, butt implants, etc… Males have circumcisions adopted from Jewish culture.  Girls piece ears when they infants.  People have tattoos (was taboo decades ago).
Come on, just because a culture is different than your own does not mean you should look down on it in disgust.  We are American, we are better than that.
I’m tired of people hiding behind their claims of “tradition” and “culture”. Foot binding was a traditional custom, why don’t people still practice this? 
Historically, traditions have often included culturally sanctioned abuse that when examined, needed to be evaluated for its ethical value. Unfortunately women were property, to be abused at the owner’s discretion. Similarly, Africans were sold into slavery and abused in the name of culture and tradition.
Also, The disparity in the high value of shark fins compared to shark meat provides an incentive for the wasteful, unsustainable, and socially irresponsible practice of shark finning. Given the high market value of the shark’s fin, it is important to note a great deal of the shark finning industry is illegal and controlled by groups not unlike drug cartels with evidence of links to organized crime. Shark fin’s are worth so much that only trafficking drugs rivals fins for profit.
As you note towards the end the shark fin bill is not just about preventing finning as you suggest at the start, it is about reducing demand for drastically-overexploited shark populations. 
This had led to 1/3 of shark species being threatened (the status of 1/2 is completely unknown) and up to fins from up to 73 million sharks being used every year. In the few places where shark fishing has any kind of regulation, marine reserves, they are fished illegally because of this excess demand.
If passed this bill will prevent fins from illegally-taken and finned sharks caught all around the world being sold in California, but it will also remove the role of California as probably the largest source of demand for shark fin outside of Asia. It will also send a very clear message to other jurisdictions throughout the world that the shark crisis is sufficiently serious that action, not platitudes, are required. It will assist in the already strong movement in China led by Yao Ming and actively supported by business leaders and the government of China to reduce demand for shark fin soup.
Shark fins can currently be imported without any kind of restriction (other than health) on their source or origins. All current legislation only applies to shark fishing within US waters.
We have heard the “Costco sells shark steak” argument before with rhinos and elephants. A rhino dies of old age what is the problem with using the horn ? The problem is lucrative markets for untraceable products don’t wait around for animals to die or fish at sustainable levels, they grab whatever they can as quickly as they can regardless of ethics or laws.
The very small shark meat market is easy to identify and source and primarily comes from relatively well managed US fisheries. That said many shark populations in the NE Atlantic crashed under “good” management and a review of the sustainability of these fisheries would probably be smart. 
Yee’s assertion “This is another example in a long line of examples of insensitivity to the culture and traditions of the Asian American community.” bears much closer scrutiny. You find the reason certain practices have faced regulation is they break health standards or risk conservation problems. The problem of rice cakes was not a cultural bash it was because the manner of their preparation is considered unsafe by health authorities. Yee’s effort was to exempt potentially hazardous food from being refrigerated after 4 hours lying around. Effectively he was fighting for lower health standards for the Asian American population. 
I agree with Yee that regulations on live animals should apply to pet stores where appropriate, but live animal bans were to prevent introduction of invasive species that could overrun native Californian species, not to attack a culture. Shipping animals around live (as opposed to processed) is a hangover from the days before refrigeration.
It is sad that shark fin is served as a healthy food when it contains high levels of the toxin methylmercury. Indeed you could argue that as all large predatory fish on sale now have to carry a clearly posted mercury warning shark fin soup should do the same. Every menu should warn pregnant women to avoid it. I once met a doctor in a hospital in Taiwan with a patient with severe mercury poisoning. When looking into the causes he discovered she had won the lottery and had eaten shark fin soup every day believing it to be healthy, only to be poisoned by it.
Assemblyman Jared Huffman is absolutely correct in his assertion that strictly regulating imports is unaffordable and impractical, let alone policing shark fishing and finning operations internationally, which is jurisdictionally and functionally impossible.
You ask “So if we can’t stop illegal shark fin distribution while federal measures are in place, what would allow a ban of shark fins in California to actually work? After all, there’s clearly a lucrative, illegal market at work here. It’s hard to imagine things would change significantly with the ban in place.”
As someone who has investigated wildlife crime in more than 40 countries worldwide and worked on the shark fin trade in 13 countries, I can tell you.
1) The vast majority of Asian Americans would totally respect the ban and the reasons for it. They would simply order another dish with the same broth with a different filler. You can even call it “faux shark fin or green shark fin or something which makes reference. Many places are already doing it. 1/3 of weddings in Singapore last year for example served something else.
2) Enforcement at the retail level is way simpler than at the border level. An undercover survey of restaurants is quick easy and cheap. Checking every shipment of goods that enter the US a lot more challenging.
3) A ban is much easier to enforce than regulation especially when the illegal activities may be taking place across the over side of the world and shark fins are hard to distinguish and sourcing to location almost impossible. 
You say “I can’t imagine people would simply give up consuming it without feeling wronged in some way.”
I can tell you millions of Asians (youth especially) have given up shark fin soup and feel very good about their decision to protect the environment or reduce animal cruelty. I can also tell you that there are many alternatives to shark fin soup. Don’t forget shark fin is tasteless, but you can use exactly the same broth with a melon which has similar texture to shark fin, mushroom strips, crab meat and other substitutes. I am told the exact texture can also be replicated using beef cartilege.
The bill doesn’t take “the easy road” that would be some meaningless regulation that would be ineffective and unenforced, it takes the only practical and realistic path given the dire state of sharks and given that California is not in a position to subsidize the shark fin industry by paying for a ton of regulation (which would probably be ineffective).
“Would a ban make people want the product any less?” you ask. 
Absolutely, people look to their governments to protect the environment, prevent animal cruelty and protect them from potentially toxic substances. If the government doesn’t act they assume there isn’t a problem. Shark fin is not addictive and associated with poverty and despair like drugs, it is about status and wealth and if it is socially unacceptable to consume it and illegal, people will move to the many other means of doing this, like other dishes or an expensive wine. 
Your arguments were used to oppose banning ivory trade, but when it happened the price of ivory went down to 1/8 of its former value overnight. The opposition said it would go through the roof. From a 50% decline in African elephant populations in 20 years (while ivory trade was being “strictly-regulated”), elephant numbers stabilized and poaching was drastically reduced. Poaching only goes up when there is speculation on re-opening the market or a new source of demand is introduced (the new affluence in mainland China).
Do you think that many people would want to make a wedding or business banquet illegal just to have shark fin in their soup when there are plenty of other dishes they could serve? Imagine the loss of face that would involve.
This bill won’t be passed hastily, it will take time, there will be hearings and it will undergo great debate. This is an ongoing  debate that I have been involved over the last thirteen years in which time literally billions of sharks have died and a large number become endangered so for me “hasty” is a relative term.
Patience is a good thing, delay can be disastrous. 
The debate is not really will the practice of eating shark fin end, it is how it ends with grace and dignity or in shame.  If we carry on with the demand and unenforceable “regulation” we will simply run out of sharks with all the knock on effects to marine ecosystems and “tradition” will inevitably be the villain in the history books. 
Or instead of defending the indefensible and delaying the inevitable Senator Yee could do what we reached out to him to do prior to any bill and embrace necessary change in a positive way, help us actively and aggressively promote Chinese alternatives to shark fin and the delights of sustainable Chinese cuisine to mitigate any possible loss of income to restauranteurs, celebrate the adaptability and resourcefulness  that has enabled Chinese culture to endure and the true compassion of Asian values, such as its deep seated respect of balance, nature, modesty and not being wasteful*.  
Now that would be true leadership worthy of a San Francisco mayor!
I love that America is the so culturally diverse and for the most part, culturally sensitive.  I say let the Chinese keep their traditions.  Place harsher punishment/fines on illegal shark finning.
Let those traditional Chinese American keep their culture but place a luxury tax on the item.  The money from harsh poacher fines and legal fin selling tax should all go to shark conservation.  
Why waste the fins when it could be put into good use to preserve future sharks?  You would also be culturally sensitive to the Chinese Americans that practices old traditions.
In addition, those restaurants that sell shark fin soup should be required by law to also provide sharkfin-substitute soup on the menu.
Read the article.  Finning is already illegal.  The question is what do you do with the fins on a shark that is caught accidentally and have died already.  The new bill would ban using the fins even though shark meat and skin is ok to use.  Why picking on the Chinese culture?  Go after the illegal poachers (heck I’m all for de-limbing those criminals).
First, a ban unquestionably would help protect the sharks from extinction.  The bans on elephant tusks and rhino horns have effectively reduced the decimation of these species.
And since when does the threat of black market affect what we do legislatively?  If that were the case, why do we have any laws whatsoever?  Drugs, guns, etc.?
Lastly, cultures adapt to accommodate reality.  That is why a number of prominent proud Asian Pacific Americans support the ban on shark fin, including: restaurateur Charles Phan (the Slanted Door), chef Martin Yan, journalist Lisa Ling, actress Kelly Hu, author Belle Yang, and Jazz musician Dan Kuramoto.  These APAs are no less proud of their culture and many of them believe that the Asian cultural belief in living in harmony with nature overrules the customary practice of consuming shark fin.
If we were afraid, bullied, or blackmailed into NOT passing laws because of cult, culture, or “tradition,” we’d allow the brutal practices that happen in other cultures (bull fighting, cock-dog fighting, bear dogging, throwing goats out of four-story windows and aggravating bulls in a ring with darts before killing them (Spain).  NO, we pass laws to outlaw both idiotic cruelty, and/or, just, if-not-more, importantly, environment impacts.  At some point, the cult supporters have to realize they’re living in the U.S., which for the most part is a civilized, law and order society.  Watch the videos of finless sharks as they sink to the bottom, trying to swim with their appendages removed.  Think of anyone without limbs so tossed, and ask yourself if this practice has any merit.
Pass the law to ban shark finning; and then move on to the disgusting live food markets everywhere.  As a society treats animals, so it’s capable of treating all animals.
Reporter Kim ignores (purposely?) a key element of this story:  THE PRIMARY AUTHOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL 376 IS ASSEMBLYMEMBER PAUL FONG (D-Mt. View).  Unlike Senator Yee (D-San Francisco), Assemblymember Fong (of Asian descent himself, born in Macao) puts environmental protection and animal welfare ahead of an archaic and horrendously cruel practice and human greed.  It’s more likely that Senator Yee is pandering to a few of his well-heeled San Francisco connections, as he plans to run for the San Francisco mayor’s office this fall.  Sad to see, for he’s been a strong supporter in the past of most environmental and animal welfare issues.  But he’s certainly dropped the ball on this one.  Politics, anyone?
And, ethic and science aside, it’s a bad political move on Yee’s part.  I’m betting that the majority of his constituents, Asian-American or otherwise, support Assemblymember Fong’s commonsense legislation.  Or will do so, once they learn the facts.
A reported 70-100 MILLION sharks are mutilated and trashed annually throughout the world in this brutal trade.   (SEE THE MANY ON-LINE VIDEOS.)  And for what?  SOUP AND SUPERSTITION.  There’s an absurd belief among many shark fin soup enthusiasts that the dish is an aphrodisiac.  Yeah, right.  (And just what the world needs, more humans.)  Get real, people!  Shark fins are mostly just gristle, chewy and tasteless (unless you like rubber).  And pricey–it’s a status item to lord it over your neighbors.  Fins cost anywhere from $300-$700 per pound.  Is the cruelty and the destruction of the marine ecosystem worth it?
Here’s an idea:  BOYCOTT ALL RESTAURANTS WHICH OFFER SHARK FIN SOUP,  AND LET THE MANAGEMENT KNOW WHY.  Shouldn’t put anyone out of business, since there are no restaurants which sell shark fin soup only.  Besides, this is an UNETHICAL and UNSUSTAINABLE business from the get-go.
It should further be noted that Senator Yee was a key player in the State Fish & Game Commission’s recent reversal of the frog/turtle ban in the live food markets, all of which are diseased and parasitized.  California annually imports TWO MILLION American bullfrogs from Taiwan, plus 300,000-400,000 thousand freshwater turtles for human consumption, all taken from the wild in states east of the Rockies, depleting local populations.  When released into California waters, a common though illegal practice, they cause environmental havoc, introducing diseases and parasites, and preying upon and displacing native species, such as the red-legged and yellow-legged frogs, the western pond turtle (our only native species), and the fry of gamefish.  Indeed, the Commission has received nearly 4,000 letters in support of the ban, from the likes of United Anglers of California, CalTrout, the Sierra Club, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, etc.  Heck, Huey Johnson, former Resources Secretary, wrote twice in support of the ban.  The Dept. of Fish & Game continues to ignore its mandate to protect our native natural resources.  Thanks a lot, Senator Yee!
ALL LEGISLATORS MAY BE WRITTEN C/O THE STATE CAPITOL, SACRAMENTO, CA  95814.  Support etters are needed NOW.  And thank Assemblymember Fong for ntroducing this legislation.  The bill has not yet been assigned to committee, but it’s likely to go to the Assembly Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee, chaired by Assemblymember Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael), a co-sponsor of the bill.  And Assemblymember Fong, the bill’s primary author, also sits on this committee.  That’s hopeful.
So please write your state reps and urge their support for this progressive and much-needed legislation.  San Francisco’s Senator Mark Leno, and Assemblymember Fiona Ma and Tom Ammiano esp. need to hear from their constituents.  Senator Yee, too, showing him the errof or his ways.
Sincerely,
Eric Mills, coordinator

Take screaming vocals, streaming smoke and a quavering splash of synthesizer and what do you have? The opening act of the jukebox musical Rock of Ages, which made its return on a star-studded Tuesday night to Los Angeles, where the Broadway smash originally began.
Daily Trojan
Playing at the Pantages until Feb. 27, the Tony-nominated show features its original, appropriately awkward rock protagonist Constantine Maroulis as Drew, a haphazard, gawky rocker working at a club before he makes it big as his musician alter ego, Wolfgang Van Cult.
Rock of Ages takes place in the Reagan era in Hollywood. That’s right, a show about Los Angeles that started in Los Angeles but then went to New York, toured the world and then returned. Call it self-conscious, but it acts as a fitting and funny bookend, which the show pokes fun at endlessly.
The play is narrated by the puckish, brash and surprisingly sexy narrator, or as he calls it, “dramatic conjurer,” Lonny.
He is joined by a cast of cartoonish misfits that range from hyper activist Regina (rhymes with vagina), a stoic German developer and his flamboyant son and a sassy strip club madam. With the characters’ talents, Rock of Ages serves up a steady onslaught of punch lines, guitar solos and crotch shots.
And the catch? All these lovely characters communicate within the context of 1980s metal hits, including classics from Whitesnake and Poison.
Anyone who has seen the show in its past versions — the original played mere blocks away at King King and the Vanguard before Broadway — will remember an absolutely head-bang worthy production with a small cast and a big sound, but this latest revamp has its distinctions.
With an all-new cast apart from Maroulis, who was born to play such a vocally challenging and adorable role, comes a mixed bag of performances. The addition of the explosive, heroin-fabulous MiG Ayesa is a welcome shot of cheap liquor after a day’s work. And no, that’s no typo. Ayesa first made his big-M, little-i, big-G name famous as a finalist on the short-lived reality show Rockstar: INXS.
Don’t write him off as C-list fodder just yet. Although he paints his eyebrows on his face, the man can absolutely carry tight jeans, a circle scarf and glittery tank tops with the swagger of a young Bret Michaels and can screech like Gene Simmons in his heydey. Ayesa takes command of the character’s raw sexuality and eerie eccentricity like no other actor before him.
Also notable was the addition of the delightfully spirited Teresa Stanley, who plays the “big mama” in a salon of strippers. Though her character’s role has been noticeably cut down, her short bursts of earthy, no-nonsense belting go nicely with the hard rock background.
Add a completely overhauled, tighter slew of choreography, a stunning set and a band nothing short of absolutely badass, and this Rock of Ages brings past audience-friendly shows like Mamma Mia to its knees, despite some hitches.
Maroulis, who has played the role since 2005, seems a bit too comfortable and calculated in his role. Though he hits every note and delivers every line, there is a hop missing in his step, most notably to the former pinnacle of the second act, “Sherrie.” What was once a dynamic love number has become a rote stage transition.
Even more disappointing is the casting choice for the female lead, Sherrie. Actress Rebecca Faulkenberry somehow manages to take an adorable, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Kansas native yearning to be an actress into an inconsistent bore. To boot, powerful rocker-chick vocals on songs like “I Wanna Know What Love Is” and “I Hate Myself For Loving You” start on missed pitches and heavy breaths.
The role of Regina, played by Casey Tuma, also misses the mark and turns a charmingly kooky Berkeley graduate into a nasal annoyance.
One cannot help but mourn for performers such as Amy Spanger, who originated Sherrie on Broadway, that balance the bouncy youthfulness of cute musical theater characters with the surly toughness of a female rock star.
What this production thrives on, however, is the evolution of a show that has really taken its identity by the reins without apology. Changes in the script allowed actors to freely poke fun at the supreme silliness and ridiculous conceits of a musical about the Los Angeles rock scene in which the Sunset Strip was touted as the city’s only cultural landmark. It’s the only Tony-nominated musical to feature a song in which a woman is, as Maroulis belts, “reaching for my sack.”
It is not afraid to break the fourth wall, handing out branded “lighters” to wave back and forth during ballads. Rock of Ages gets up on stage with a fist in the air and a pair of socks in its pants, unapologetically gyrating and wagging its tongue.
Though the show is neither anywhere near perfect nor original, it is, just like one of its numbers, “nothing but a good time.”
Rock of Ages runs Tuesday through Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 1 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. until Feb. 27. Tickets start at $25. For more information visit www.BroadwayLA.org.
Do your homework before trashing this show.  Constantine HAS NOT played this role since 2005!  You’re an idiot!
You clearly have no idea what your talking about…piping out rock vocals for 9 shows a week for the past several months isn’t easy.  I’ve seen the show several times and think it is perfect!  A+
You obviously have taste and a critical eye outside of the mainstream.  Stick up your butt?
And the nerve to send this garbage straight to the lead of the show?
What is wrong with you?
Amy Spanger screeched her way through the show and rarely showed up.   And Rebecca Faulkenberry is taking the lead role on Broadway soon, so you have no idea what you are talking about.

It took the people of Egypt 18 days to unseat their former leader, autocratic President Hosni Mubarak, but it will take many more before the protestors get what they want: a true democracy.
The Egyptian revolution has just begun and many questions remain unanswered.
Led by no one in particular, organized through social media sites like Facebook and Twitter and empowered by a fearless and determined spirit of hope, Egyptian protestors remarkably overcame 30 years of oppression and tyranny last week.
The 80 million people of the most populous country in the Arab world are writing a new chapter in Egypt’s history.
The proponents of Egypt’s “Revolution 2.0” must continue their inspired acts of civil disobedience.
The Egyptian Army has assumed power, but many issues, such as the unjust emergency law, the presence of corruption, the opposition’s lack of leadership and, in regards to the United States, the future civilian government’s stance on Egypt’s geopolitical role, still exist.
Unfortunately, unseating a deeply corrupt and despotic ruler is not enough for the opposition to claim victory when so many elements of the former system are still in place.
Though Egypt’s Supreme Military Council has already dissolved parliament, suspended the constitution and called for elections in six months, it has not clarified the current status of Egypt’s infamous emergency law, which allowed Mubarak’s regime to imprison anyone it liked without charge or legal trial.
The Egyptian Army should quickly put an end to the emergency law and make plans to empower its judicial system to act as a legitimate check and balance power over the future executive and legislative bodies.
Corruption serves to upset and deteriorate a government’s ability to perform its role as servant to the public, entrusted to develop and strengthen its country in a proper and just manner.
“The apparatus of repression and corruption in Egypt is much bigger and much deeper [than just Mubarak], and to root it out and have a hope for a more participatory democratic society is a huge, huge task,” said Laurie Brand, a professor of international relations at USC.
For this reason, Egyptians should be wary of the Egyptian Army, which controls a significant part of Egypt’s business sector and economy and was likely involved in corrupt practices under Mubarak’s regime.
The protestors who marched on Tahrir Square for 18 days will make progress in establishing democratic values and practices in Egypt, insofar as they are able first to organize themselves and find legitimate leaders within their youthful ranks.
In support of this goal, the U.S. State Department announced that it was preparing new aid packages to opposition groups in Egypt.
The groups that would receive the undisclosed amounts remain unclear, however, because the citizens who the United States would like to support unorganized.
The civilian leaders who will emerge from the fray and assume roles in Egypt’s new government will need to show as much sophistication and vigor in providing stability to the Middle East as they did in demonstrating in the streets of Cairo.
None of these challenges should detract from what the Egyptian people have just accomplished. As Americans, we should enthusiastically support those who seek to remove the shackles of repression in search of self-determination. And as students, we should recognize that the United States should not always dictate the affairs of foreign countries.
Still, the civilian leadership that assumes power in six months will need to overcome significant challenges before Egypt becomes truly democratic.
“For more stories on the crisis in Egypt, click here. “
William Fay is a senior majoring in international relations. His column, “Facing Our Global Challenges,” runs every other Thursday.
The article states the US should not try to dictate the affairs of foreign countries — and I agree, i do not care for our country to be too overly invested in a group of people that still believe they have to kneel 5 times a day to an imaginary god that preaches misogyny and homophobia. However, whenever I hear students being critical of the US, I am amused at how many other countries really try and be like the US or at least benefit from a culture like the US. Just look at Mexico – often times I hear Mexicans say hateful things about the Yankees yet it is their countrymen who kill themselves to flee their 3rd world conditions to come live here. Similarly, the people of Egypt can only really start welcoming the modern world and its benefits if they learn to shed the medieval hatred generations of fundamental religious doctrine branded into their psyche. It is too easy for anyone to call a person a racist if they are critical of Islam. In fact it is funny when people make an extra effort to say Islam is a religion of peace and any other opinion automatically casts someone as a racist. We have developed a repression condition in our politically correct society where total honest conversation is discouraged and everything is cloaked is a very dishonest blanket of political correctness. Is Ayaan Hirsi Ali a racist when she describes her own experiences as a woman living in a society engulfed in this religion of peace? The men of Egypt who brutalized and sexually assaulted Lara Logan while yell “Jew, Jew” as if that was a pejorative — these are the men who presumably were the champions of their new democracy. I hate to admit it but Democracy is not for all people. Along with democracy comes responsibility and responsibility demands intelligence and rational behavior. There are Americans that I see everyday and I shudder to think they are free to roam around in society…At this moment in history, Islamic cultures are challenged with reconciling the rational demands of the modern world with their 7th Cent beliefs. This is a struggle they will continue to have if they allow religious ideology inform how they wish to construct their society. It just does not work and any liberal student who claims it does also knows deep down inside they would never want to live in such a society themselves anyway. The hypocrisy is humorous and sickening. If Commanders in the US Navy prayed to Neptune everyday and made command decisions based on what they interpreted would please Neptune, we would feel uncomfortable and we definitely would not want to develop military or political policy on such basis. Yet when established religion, at least the ones still in vogue today (as opposed to the legions of passe Gods of the past) we are forbidden to make rational, critical opinions because automatically some naive, liberal, sheltered SoCal denizen will be quick to say you are a racist. I really believe if the number of liberals we have today existed in the 1940’s, they would be saying – well Nazism should not be judged – it is just another way of thinking and believing. Our judgement has become destroyed with cultural relativism – to the point of absurdity. Good luck Egypt – you got what you wished for – the world will be watching what you do with your Democracy – Like a new college student living on his own outside the curfewed boundaries of his parents watch. Let’s see if this is too much freedom too fast for you guys.
Arafat, I think it’s beyond clear that you’re a bigot. I’ve read few comments in my life that reek of such ignorance and hatred.
Man of reason,
Here is a man of reason who sees Islam no differently than I do.
freethoughtnation.com/contributing-writers/63-acharya-s/479-richard-dawkins-islam-is-one-of-the-great-evils-of-the-world.html
I’m used to people like you attacking me while refusing to debate the issue at hand.  All that tells me is you either cannot successfully debate the issues, or that you are a bigot whose comments reek of ignorance and hatred.
The only way for the people of the Middle East (all of Islam for that matter) to experience true democracy is to free themselves from the shackles of Islam.
Islam and democracy are incompatible and anyone who says Indonesia is an example they are simply showing just how dire Islamic democracies are.
Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, Oman, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Mauritania, Niger, Algeria, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kirgizstan, etc…
Name one country from this or any list of Islamic dominated countries where one can freely criticize Islam, convert from Islam, proselytize for any other religion, draw pictures of Mohammed, criticize Saudi Arabia, openly practice homosexuality or Judaism, be a free woman with all this implies.
So please don’t blame Egypt’s problems on America. I would bet money that if America could foster true democracy in any Muslim country it would, just as it fostered freedoms and democracy in Germany and Japan after WWII.
Quit blaming their problems on anyone but them and their backwards-looking religion.
Finally, let me say, Mohammed was Islam’s first political leader. He refused to acknowledge a separation of mosque and state as Jesus did (Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s…). Mohammed was a theocratic despot who killed, raped, enslaved and pillaged his way to power and wealth.
This is who Muslims look to for direction, no? Not to America, but to Mohammed and therein lies the tale of the tape.

“Welcome to Facebook.”
It’s the most memorable line of David Fincher’s 2010 film The Social Network because it has come to define our generation as a whole, most notably those enrolled in college.
In fact, Facebook has become such a crucial aspect of our lives as college students that it’s hard to imagine what life would be like without it.
But for any technology to be harnessed effectively, we have to realize how to use it in moderation. With Facebook, that’s something we don’t really understand how to do yet.
That’s why I think college life would be better without Facebook — or at least with a smaller dose of it.
500 million active users, 50 percent of whom log on every single day.
Facebook claims 200 million active mobile users, all of whom use Facebook at least twice as much as the other 300 million.
More than 2.5 million websites have integrated it, so it’s everywhere, with 10,000 signing up every day.
And yet, even with all these stats, I think the most damning one is this: “People spend over 700 billion minutes per month on Facebook,” according to Facebook’s statistics page.
It’s safe to assume something very productive and beneficial could have been done with those 700 billion minutes.
If every Facebook user accounted for a similar share of the time, that would come out to 23.3 hours per month, per person.
We know that’s not the case, so that means more active users are spending more than a full day per month using Facebook.
There’s a big difference between social networking and being social. Although the two can reflect each other, it’s still not quite the same thing.
We haven’t replaced real social activity with an online version of it, though — we’re just doing both now. So the time has to have come from somewhere else.
Is it our studies? A study by the British newspaper, The Times, says yes. An article published in The Times said those active on Facebook perform sometimes as much as full letter grades lower on exams.
Facebook is a social hub for many students. But it is just that, and it needs to be kept in its place before we allow it to interfere with other crucial aspects of our lives.
Welcome to Facebook.

For millions of college students, Facebook has become a fact of life — it is a vast source of social stimulation that showcases the glamorous and interesting aspects of our everyday lives.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
So quitting Facebook  is easier said than done, especially since much of our generation’s social, and even professional, interactions now depend on web-based content. Facebook will be here to stay for a while, and rightfully so.
Although Facebook has many beneficial aspects like easy access to upcoming social events and increased contact with old friends, it also forces people to fixate and obsess over their digital image.
Many college students utilize Facebook to portray themselves as they want others to see them.
People list eclectic music tastes, post photographs from nights in Hollywood and quote their favorite authors to build a digital persona that will portray a favorable image to their fraternity brothers or sorority sisters, professional contacts and even parents.
Facebook is a mixture of people presenting a brand of themselves to other people and observing what others are doing without actually engaging with them in the real world.
In other words, people go to parties and take cool pictures that they post on Facebook to build a digital “brand” instead of creating interpersonal relationships in the real social sphere.
Stephanie Pushaw, a sophomore majoring in creative writing, argues that Facebook takes away from the day-to-day interactions with peers.
“People in social situations are often more invested in taking pictures to create the Facebook persona to show that they had a good time, rather than existing in the moment,” Pushaw said.
Facebook conveys the idea that we are always going out with friends and having fun.These false perceptions won’t necessarily make us happy.The reality is that most of us spend many of our hours alone, either by choice or because we have to finish our work.
“Facebook presents other people at the highlights of their lives, which implies that it is the only way that they live,” Pushaw said.
So the question is, if Facebook makes people unhappy, why do they continue to use it?
For Pushaw, it’s the desire to see what her friends are doing and  keep track of social events.
“It would be harder, but not impossible, to have a social life without Facebook,” Pushaw acknowledged.
So I tried it out. Pushaw and I both quit Facebook.
Pushaw quickly realized that she was unable to look at event dates, couldn’t send electronic messages and had nowhere to upload her photos. She was back on Facebook within the hour.
I am currently still off Facebook, but the desire to rejoin is ever present.
The bottom line is that Facebook is necessary to live in our current society — it is the tool we use to make our lives more efficient.
Despite the arguments against its negative impact on our generation, Facebook is a tool that will continue to define the way we interact with our peers, judge our rivals and identify ourselves in  an increasingly digital world.
As Pushaw says, “I wish I weren’t so dependent on Facebook, but I don’t see myself getting rid of it anytime soon.”

The 2011 USG elections kicked off this Tuesday and we want to know what you think! Which candidates are you voting for and why? Here are what a few USC students had to say.
Editor’s note: In this series of videos, the Daily Trojan set out to capture the voices of students as they cast their ballots for next year’s Undergraduate Student Government representatives. We had hoped to provide a snapshot of student life in an intriguing and accessible way.
In this particular video, however, all of the students we interviewed happened to have voted for the same candidate. Though we had wanted to showcase these students’ opinions to provide our readers with a direct glimpse into USC student life, we have since heard complaints that the video sounded like an endorsement for a specific ticket, which was never our intention.
As such, we have chosen to take the video down. Other videos in this series that feature students talking about a variety of candidates will remain on our blog. We hope our readers will find the videos a new and engaging way to tap into the minds of USC students.
Mike how much do you get paid to sit on the DT and write nasty comments about other candidates?
A clean sweep?
If DT is doing its job right, it sure looks like clean sweep….
Unless DT hand picked these voters…. In an effort to justify and boost its endorsed candidate?

Approximately 100 nurses and medical staff gathered outside of the USC University Hospital Tuesday to hold an informational picket.
The nurses and medical staff are demanding an increase in staffing levels in order to minimize patient risk.
Although the medical staff, represented by the members of the National Union of Healthcare Workers and the registered nurses, represented by the California Nurses Association, have entered separate negotiations with the hospital, they both claim to be fighting for patient rights.
The hospital has suggested dissolving the Patient Care Committees, which advises the hospital on appropriate staffing levels.
According to NUHW, if staffing does not increase, Patient Care Technicians could be responsible for the care of 32 patients at a time.
Dana Green, a freshman majoring in engineering, believes that the patient should come first, when it comes to medical treatment.
“If more nurses and medical staff are needed to properly take care of patients, than I agree with the demands of the picketers,” Green said.
The Los Angeles Times reported that hospital officials have vowed to cooperate with both unions and hope to reach a mutual agreement.
The USC University Hospital serves 50,000 inpatients and 750,000 outpatients annually and has 293 beds.
NUHW represents caregivers at the hospital including respiratory therapists, patient care technicians and surgical technicians.
