With students increasingly concerned about health and sustainability, eating organic produce has become more common. In response, a number of farmers markets have popped up around campus — but it may be that these farmers markets are not the healthiest, freshest or most economical way to get food.
There are currently four farmers markets easily accessible to USC students: one run by USC Hospitality at the University Park Campus, one at the Health Sciences Campus, a weekly market on Shrine Place and a weekend farmers market at Exposition Park. The Hospitality-run markets began last year, but the others are recent additions to the organic scene.

But some experts say students might want to think twice before they flock to farmers markets.
Dr. Roger Clemens, an expert in food industry and health trends and an adjunct professor at the USC School of Pharmacy, said the miscalculation of the health benefits of organic foods — which are often a major selling point at farmers markets — is the only thing that has turned the organic food market into a viable one.
“There’s a perceived health difference. Perception drives much of the market. It’s kind of a placebo effect,” Clemens said.
According to Clemens, the nutritional value from an organic apple, for example, is negligible compared to that of a conventionally farmed apple. Citing a study published in the American Journal of Public Health in July, Clemens said it appears there is no connection between nutrition and organic farming, despite the perception that this connection exists.
“The only thing that the organic food has added so far is a cost to your pocketbook,” Clemens said.
Clemens estimated organic foods can cost 30 to 50 percent more than their conventionally farmed counterparts.
Jackie Matthews, a sophomore majoring in print journalism, said it is this cost difference that often keeps her away from organic foods.
“I feel healthier when I eat organic food, but it’s too expensive for my whole diet to consist of it,” she said.
But Matthew Oden, USC’s Sustainability Program Manager, said there are benefits to eating organic beyond just nutritional value and these benefits make it worth the cost.
“Organic food is a huge step in the right direction,” he said.
Oden said organic food is beneficial to the environment because less land is used in organic farming. He said those who can afford to buy organic should do so, even though the foods are a little pricier.
“I think anyone who can help to purchase organically grown products should,” Oden said. “We’re talking 20 cents or 50 cents more on common items. I think most of us could definitely find a way to save eight bucks a week in another area.”
But with the cost of organic food higher than that of conventionally farmed foods, college students are not always willing to spend the extra money, said Riti Chandiok, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies who is also co-president of the Environment First club.
“Not only is organic food more expensive, but it’s not as easily accessible,” Chandiok said.
Chandiok noted the on-campus farmers market — the one most accessible for students — cannot compete with the markets at the Shrine and Exposition Park in terms of size, making it an unreliable means for organic grocery shopping, even if there is student interest.
And it seems the cost and unreliability have kept students away, despite their interest in eating organic.
Spencer Trujillo, a senior majoring in economics, said he goes to the on-campus farmers market occasionally, but does not make a point of it.
“I would go, but it depends if I’m headed to class or what my schedule is or if it catches my eye,” he said.
Marcos Diaz, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism, echoed this sentiment.
“I like organic food, but I won’t go out of my way to get it,” he said.
The article omitted another nearby farmers market: Community Services Unlimited, a local nonprofit organization,  offers a small produce stand every Thursday afternoon from 3:00-6:00 in front of the swimming stadium on Menlo in Expo Park. Most of the produce is grown right there, behind the nearby senior center. CSU’s mission is to work towards healthy and sustainable communities. They do work with local schools to educate kids about nutrition and agriculture.  I visit every week because the organization does good work and the produce is locally grown in USC’s neighborhood. Prices aren’t bad either.
The Organic Trade Association (OTA) would like to point out that buying organic is easier and in many ways more affordable than ever before. Not only do organic products appear on store shelves in mainstream retail outlets around the country, but thanks to the introduction of organic private label products, the growth of farmers’ markets selling organic products, and organic’s lack of dependence on petroleum-based farm inputs, the gap between organic and non-organic prices is closing. Indeed, in some cases, the price of organic goods is comparable to non-organic goods, making the decision to “go organic” simple and cost-effective.
In thinking about which organic products to buy, OTA would encourage consumer to consider this: instead of focusing your organic purchases on a particular group of items, choose organic versions of the products you buy most. Whether that is milk, produce, or personal care products, buying organic will not only help reduce your exposure to harmful synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, but also support a system of agricultural management that is great for the planet.
How does a commentary on the value of organic food fail to mention pesticides at all?
I would like to ask Dr. Clemens…what about health concerns based on pesticides? I’m a little unsure about the value of buying organic when I’ve heard that sometimes there are still certain chemicals that can be applied to “organic” foods, but I just wanted to point out: the reason I’d buy organic isn’t because I think that an organic apple somehow has a higher nutritional value than a non-organic one, it’s because I don’t want pesticides in my food!

Red Bull quite literally gave soapbox racers wings in Downtown Los Angeles Saturday.
With vehicles designed in the shape of a Tapatio hot sauce bottle, a banana hammock and the famous Nintendo dinosaur Yoshi, the Red Bull Soapbox Race displayed a great deal of creativity, excitement and crashes in front of a crowd of more than 111,000 people. Despite the soaring temperatures, people swarmed the streets to catch a glimpse of the race, with some spectators perched on trees and stoplights to get a better view.

Los Angeles is the latest host of the Red Bull Soapbox Race, a competition for innovative thrill-seekers that first began in Belgium in 2000. Since its inception, the Red Bull Soapbox Race has hosted races in 30 countries, including Austria, England, Jamaica, the Czech Republic and Australia.
The event showcased the infamous USC vs. UCLA rivalry, with the USC Phi Kappa Psi team ready to beat Team Bruins in its soapbox designed in the shape of a chariot with tiny stuffed Bruins dragging behind on ropes.
According to Phi Psi’s driver senior Ryan Arango, the team’s soapbox took a total of 48 hours to construct.
“It required a lot of runs to Home Depot and cutting two bikes in half with a skill saw,” Arango said.
The UCLA team’s soapbox, on the other hand, was designed in the shape of a bear with a “Beware of Bruins” sign on the bumper; a driver dressed as a bear completed the theme.
With USC set as the 24th team to race, followed by UCLA at number 25, the two teams were located next to each other in Pit Row, drawing large cheering crowds supporting their favorite university and perpetuating the rivalry.
While Arango and co-pilot junior Clark Claydon seemed excited about the race, their vehicle did not have a working brake on one side. This caused some concern when they were racing down a track with steep drops, high speeds and a 90-degree turn.
“Our biggest challenge was designing a steering mechanism that could handle our need for speed,” said Phi Psi’s team captain senior Chad Greene.

But like most teams racing that day, both the USC and UCLA vehicles ended up crashing before the finish line — but still earned loud cheers from the audience.
Crashing, however, is not as tragic as it seems at this soapbox race. The soapbox teams are not judged on the time it takes to reach the finish line, but are evaluated on speed, creativity and showmanship. Despite experiencing several crashes throughout the race, teams such as The Eager Beavers earned high points for their agility, design, innovation and, of course, the audience’s response to the extreme crashes at turns and into the haystacks toward the end of the race.
The winning team on Saturday — San Francisco’s Team Ironhead — raced at a phenomenal speed of 46.1 mph. They officially marked their territory in the Red Bull Soapbox Race record books for racing at the fastest speed ever. As the winning team, it also won a VIP NASCAR experience with the Red Bull Racing Team.
With football set aside for just a few hours, the Red Bull Soapbox Race provided universities with the opportunity to contest their college rivalries in a creative, fun-filled environment. The Los Angeles cityscape was the backdrop, and the event garnered more spectators than the maximum capacity of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. In addition to USC and UCLA, teams from Cal Poly Pomona, CSU Long Beach, CSU Northridge, Loyola Marymount University, Oregon State University and the University of North Texas all participated to promote their school pride.
But whether it’s a soapbox race, volleyball tournament or a plain old Tuesday, USC always attracts a crowd of fans supporting them in their next football game. With the USC vs. Washington State football game later that evening, USC  Trojans chanted, “Beat the Cougars!” in full swing throughout the race. When asked about his plans later that evening, Claydon said, “As long as I’m not in the hospital, I will be at the game tonight.”
I was there and visited the pit area before the race and I gotta say as an alum I was embarassed with the entry representing the school.  I mean seriously, couldn’t they have put a call out to the campus to get some help putting the thing together. It was literally exposed two by fours jerry-rigged on top of bicycle wheels. I know it was grass roots and all, but I think the local high school science club would have done a much more credible job.  The rig fell apart before they even got halfway down the hill.

I have recently come to terms with one incredibly embarrassing fact about myself: I rock at online games.
When it comes to the digital world of gaming, I consider myself quite the expert — I was taking “Serial Killer or Kindergarten Teacher?” quizzes and playing the Helicopter Game while the rest of the world was still busy with Minesweeper. My computer chair was my throne, and I sat, eyes glued to the computer, ingesting meme after meme while reading my friends’ AIM profiles.

It was through a fellow digitally inclined friend’s profile that I discovered Albino Blacksheep, a site that featured funny videos, flash animations and other content no one but a high schooler would enjoy. After watching only a few of these videos, I would quickly grow bored and scan the site for something more entertaining. It was on one of these many scanning ventures that I stumbled upon the games forum.
And then the fun began.
Squares 2, Bejeweled, Bubble Spinner — the options were endless. My bedtime became later and later as I discovered more ways to test myself — logic puzzles, action games, you name it. I even discovered an adventure game where I assumed the role of a boy and tried to date my dream girl; it, unfortunately, turned out to be anime porn.
Practice made me darn close to perfect, and, the better I got, the more captivated I became. Slowly, my habit started to look more like an addiction. The Sims effectively gave me agoraphobia, but I lived an incredibly full virtual life. I found online gaming communities that were able to satisfy my need for interaction, and to this day I swear I already met my future husband in a Neopets forum.
Throughout the years I have kept fueling my obsession by finding new games to be awesome at. I have had good luck with friend recommendations, from Facebook’s addicting Packrat to the essential quiz database of Sporcle. However, this week I was introduced to something that killed not only my opinion of interactive gaming communities, but my respect for all its users: Farmville.
Farmville is — for a lack of a better term — worthless. Buying virtual agriculture with virtual coins is not even close to a quality form of procrastination. In fact, offering a substitute to real shopping may be even filling a void for consumers, partially causing our economic recession — not to be dramatic, or anything.
Farmville is currently the top application on Facebook, and while it infuriates me, it doesn’t surprise me. The app offers no clear purpose besides a weird sort of community, and that is what so much of the Internet thrives on. Online gaming doesn’t have to be you, isolated and alone, pressing the arrow keys until you’re satisfied with a score. It can be a group of people on the same website, doing pointless things — but doing them together.
A number of today’s online fads are community-based games, and this has to do with our current networking nature. People like inviting others to be part of their society, and everyone gets added enjoyment from the way it feels to communicate with someone through a different medium. When they create real human interaction, online games go far beyond simple entertainment.
In a sense, online games function as their own little meaningless version of social networks. As seen by my Neopets boyfriend (if you’re reading this, Facebook me!) and the thousands of other “relationships” coined through message boards and the like, raising made-up animals doesn’t have to mean you’ll be antisocial.
Because they are so interactive, many of today’s online games don’t even explain how to “win.” Instead, they offer a society where making friends and trading items gets you to the top, allowing a realm for even the most socially awkward to assume the position of a cool kid.
As pathetic as it sounds, I personally enjoy online games because they are one of few competitive activities I excel at. Everyone needs to be good at something, be it football or chemistry or Bubble Spinner. If procrastination offers you self-confidence, enjoyable communication or even entertainment, then it’s not really procrastination at all — it’s a pleasurable pastime.

French music is not like mainstream American pop music. It, like the overall French culture, embodies a nuance that reflects more than just the standard expectations. Instead of common beats and rhythms, most French pop exudes refined combinations of many eccentric styles of music.
Starting Wednesday and continuing for two days, the OohLaLa French Music Festival showcased almost a dozen acts that demonstrated the integration of French and American cultures through music.

The Henry Fonda Theater welcomed all French-loving attendees, who filled up the entire venue with wine, cigarettes and the flare of the French language.
This culture was absorbed and upheld for three days, but in no way was it ever elitist. Appropriately ignoring any stereotypes portraying French culture as snobbish, the festival welcomed American influence that was wholeheartedly embraced by the musicians.
Many acts were indeed performed in French, but much was also highlighted in English performances. The combination of the two made the language barrier insignificant and, after a point, even unrecognizable. The music, whether it was in French or English, projected itself as indifferent of either language and solidified itself as the type of music any concertgoer would enjoy.
Thursday night began with Soko, a French singer-songwriter, who performed entirely in English. If she had not mentioned it, the audience wouldn’t have known she was French. Her music and style, which resonates more American pop than French, made her impossible to label.
The weakest part to her act was her solitary presence on stage. Alone with her guitar, her music was simple and too familiar, but, after being joined by her seven bandmates, the overall sound greatly improved. The mixture of numerous instruments and additional singers gave her music a faster rhythm and, overall, a more diverse arrangement.
The Do — a French/Finnish duo of Dan Levy and Olivia Merilahti — along with backing drummer, distinguished themselves from all notions of simply being a French version of She & Him as soon as they started playing.
Levy, on keyboards and bass guitar, provided a devastating rhythm section that helped complement his partner’s talents while still persisting in his own skillful determination.
But the real gem of this duo is Merilahti, Levy’s attractive but ferocious counterpart. She savagely plays guitar and then adds light lyrics and melodies — some in English.
The pair sang only one song in French before walking off stage frustrated over continuous technical difficulties, but the three songs that The Do did perform were the best songs of the night.
And then there was Hollywood, Mon Amour, which was by far one of the most unique groups France has to offer. A modest-sized band with two female singers, this group specializes in exactly what its name infers: cinema, most notably the music from 1980s American cinema.
Its prolonged and slow-tempo versions of “Eye of the Tiger,” “What a Feeling” and “Ghostbusters” are unique to the group and resonate nothing of the original songs, making them quite personal to the band. Their sound, however, is not as endearing as it is interesting, and after a few songs, it all becomes comical.
One singer from Hollywood, Mon Amour addressed a stuffed gorilla as Maverick and then proceeded to seduce it by singing Top Gun’s “Take My Breath Away,” elaborating on the exaggerated sense of performance in their act.
Other French acts including Jamaica, The Shoes, Cocoon and Sebastian Tellier filled the other two nights. As a whole, OohLaLa successfully made French culture, and most importantly its music, accessible for all.
Although French pop might still seem uncommon in American mainstream culture, it has become so infused with American music over the years. Despite the apparent language barrier, the OohLaLa Festival displayed how French pop music has become more relatable and enjoyable for both countries.
It is through your response that the emotional/cellular memory may be released. Do not think that you have to just stay still and concentrate on the music! In fact, if the music inspires you to get up and do something or your mind begins to wander, allow, allow, allow! Allow all responses without judgment. On the other hand, do not begin listening to the music while you are already doing other unrelated activities. The important thing is to let the music embrace you totally.

So the economy isn’t looking too good. For many of us, graduation draws ever nearer, and we look at the “real world” like nervous skydivers lacking confidence in their parachutes. Job searching may yield good results for some, but the fear of rejection and the image branded into us from the bleak economic news makes us realize not everyone can get that golden job.
Statistics help highlight the grim situation: Less than one-fifth of the beleaguered class of 2009 job hunters found employment, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics helpfully adds that as of August 2009, 15.1 percent of 20- to 24-year-olds are currently unemployed; the percentage for 25- to 34-year-olds only decreased by about a third — 10.4 percent.

With such a gloomy outlook, it’s easy to try letting the problem simmer and coming back to it later.
Go ahead and grip onto that red Solo cup a little tighter and savor the party music like it’s the last time you’ll hear it. If things don’t work out, then we might end up like Will Ferrell in Step Brothers: living at home with Mom and Dad (cue dramatic music).
For most of us, moving back home is an option from anywhere between Plan B and Plan Z. A few might think of it as Plan A because it’s a smarter, cheaper way to live, but the move from being an independent college student back to the house-of-lesser-freedom is equally tough. No matter how many plans are made to ensure a steady transition into post-grad life, moving back home is pretty much a universal and glaringly obvious option that anyone with an avoid-at-all-costs attitude must eventually face.
The signs are all there: the bad economy, the increasing unemployment rate, the housing crisis. We are becoming more and more defined as the “boomerang generation.”
The term was coined to describe the trend of young adults who, after spending a period of time away, find themselves returning home. According to a survey conducted by the job aggregator Monster.com, 48 percent of graduates from the class of 2008 said they planned to return to their parents’ houses for at least a little bit before striking out on their own. Of those surveyed from the class of 2007, 43 percent were still living at home nine months after graduation.
It’s always been an illusion that adulthood precludes parental cohabitation. The occasional knocking of heads is inevitable when moving back home, but it’s important to look at the bigger picture. Ultimately, the situation needs to be re-evaluated — moving back home for a short amount of time might be the only option for many frustrated graduates.
First off, there has to be a well-thought-out and discussed plan. That doesn’t mean that the move back home should just be the fallback result of the failed job search. The first thing to do is to look at the move as a step forward rather than a step back. Nobody ever said we had to figure out exactly what we’re going to do with the rest of our life in four years. Returning to the roost is an opportunity in the same way that moving out to college was.
Second, it’s important to preserve that same enthusiasm carried throughout college. Losing that will pretty much negate the reason for coming to USC in the first place. Home for the post-grad should not just be the place to catch up on television and old friends. If home is close to school, students should keep close to campus to take advantage of the resources. If it isn’t, they should make use of alumni resources. Ultimately, it’s important to maximize the opportunities at hand.
The restricted freedom may seem like a huge hindrance, but letting that perspective go without debate seals defeat. Negotiation is key to surviving the transition back home. As long as grads don’t slack off on the job search and give serious thought to what they want to do (remember that parents aren’t mind readers), freedom should be less of an issue.
So you can keep holding onto that red Solo cup to enjoy the last bit of college fun. Or you can put it down for a second and strategically plan the graceful exit from college. Either way, the door to the real world is open.

Students who heard a noise that sounded like a gunshot early this morning weren’t alone.
A DPS Community Service Officer patrolling near Gate 3 heard what he thought was a gunshot around 3:40 a.m. this morning, though officers still don’t know what – if anything – was shot.
“There may have been [shots], but we haven’t found anything that’s been shot, whether a building, a car or whatever,” DPS Capt. David Carlisle said.
Officers did find a suspect and weapons, though.  Minutes after the CSO reported hearing the potential gunshots, a different DPS officer saw a vehicle speeding down Figueroa Street and turn onto Jefferson Boulevard, Carlisle said.
DPS followed the vehicle until it eventually stopped near a residence on Magnolia Avenue. Officers found two handguns and numerous shell casings during a search of the car, and LAPD subsequently arrested the driver, a 27-year-old-male from Bell Gardens, on a concealed weapon charge.
LAPD officers are still trying to determine if shots we actually fired. There is currently no known connection to USC.

As summer finally gives way to fall, the blistering season will forever be known for its rash of celebrity deaths. As if the hyped media blitz or never-ending Twitter updates weren’t enough to keep you in the know, let’s recap shall we?
In the past few months, actress Farrah Fawcett and actor Patrick Swayze both lost their fights with cancer, talk show personality and TV host Ed McMahon died as a result of ongoing health problems, and before he could make it to rehab, celebrity disc jockey DJ AM died of a drug overdose.
Similarly, King of the Infomercial, “OxiClean” pitchman Billy Mays died of heart disease and, for those of you without television sets, Internet access or sentience, King of Pop Michael Jackson “jamon”ed his last. Producing just one made-for-TV movie and a series of failed modeling campaigns, Lindsay Lohan’s career also took its fatal plunge this year.
But rather than mourn Hollywood’s losses, or in some cases celebrate the deceased’s accomplishments, many saw it as the perfect time to capitalize on people’s pain to do what Americans unfailingly attempt to do: make money.
Cue the souvenir T-shirts and collectible CDs for this once-in-a-lifetime event: death.
With impeding deaths being fiercely covered by mainstream media outlets, exploitation and glorification rose to new heights. Instead of a moment of silence, the media had itself a heyday — a noisy one too.
Weeks into Fawcett’s cancer fight, tabloids produced pictures of the bald actress, facing chemotherapy and in ailing condition. Online gossip rags offered ridiculous amounts to sway hospital staff to leak confidential medical records. In family members’ periods of grief, paparazzi maneuvered illegally to get personal reactions and interviews.
Note to TMZ: Sending paparazzi to private memorial services is not OK. Though the public’s demand for information needed answering, websites like TMZ must always remember to act within limits. Normal, everyday actions are known to make headlines (e.g. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt losing a front tooth or Britney Spears going to Ralph’s), but a celebrity’s death must be uniquely handled with appropriate discretion, respect and privacy.
Still, the media’s lack of sensitivity over the warm months would not have been so clear if the deaths had not hit Hollywood by the dozens. Each death intensified the debate as to whether the media was moving further out of line.
Madonna actually pointed the finger at the inquiring public for overexposure of Jackson’s death, saying that prior to the legend’s cardiac arrest, many of his fans had already abandoned him because of negative stories in the press. Personal remorse became a stimulus in the growing curiosity surrounding the deceased pop star.
Like Madonna, music newcomer Lady Gaga also commented on death, this time through her MTV Video Music Award performance of her single “Paparazzi,” an ironic, elegiac song that describes her obsession with fame. During the performance, Gaga was portrayed as being shot on the stage, with the help of fake, projectile blood. She was then reincarnated in a simulated chapel. Her theatrics had a point: Like a bad car accident, death forces us to rubberneck and not turn away.
Suddenly, the tables are turned and angry criticism is directed at the other side: the usually innocent public. Celebrities will obviously sign up to invest their full lives to the public (or as long we want them), but in the afterlife the general public should know when to step off.
Even in Hollywood, a place full of action and alive with excitement, death should not be taken lightly.

Where is the opinion here? I see a hackneyed rehashing of facts. Better luck next time.

A new set of rankings finds President Steven B. Sample and Football Head Coach Pete Carroll in rather exclusive company.
The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s annual survey of employees at the largest non-profits around the country, which was released Monday, places President Sample at nine on the list of Top 10 executive compensation packages in 2008, with a total compensation of $1,161,721.
President Sample is accompanied by the presidents of other major universities, including NYU, Columbia and Yale, all of whom earned more than a million dollars in 2008.
The survey also highlighted employees at non-profit organizations who make more than their CEOs or Presidents, putting Pete Carroll at second place with earnings of $4,386,652, only coming behind Yale University’s chief investment officer.
Despite the high numbers — and the median 7 percent increase in total executive compensation for 2008 — the study found that executives at nearly one-third of the 352 organizations were choosing to take a pay cut or forgo bonuses for the coming year.
