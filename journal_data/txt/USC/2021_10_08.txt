My Netflix watch list hasn’t included “Squid Game” yet, but by the looks of my social media feeds, I’d better change that. In a matter of days, the Netflix original Korean drama has become the streaming service’s biggest non-English language show. 
On TikTok, the hashtag “#SquidGame” amassed 29.5 billion views and the “Squid Game” sound, a Korean song sung during the show’s version of “Red Light, Green Light,” has been used 998,700 times. While many of the videos include cosplay, memes and recreations of the dalgona candies made on the show, a large number of videos contain analysis of Netflix’s English subtitles. 
What these videos reveal is that you can’t always trust subtitles. 
According to these creators, “Squid Game’s” English subtitles are oversimplified to the point that the viewer is being given inaccurate information about key character traits and K-drama tropes. 
TikTok user Youngmi Mayer posted a video explaining the mistranslations and tweeted the following: “not to sound snobby but i’m fluent in korean and i watched ‘squid game’ with english subtitles and if you don’t understand korean, you didn’t really watch the same show. translation was so bad. the dialogue was written so well and zero of it was preserved.”
According to Mayer, Mi-Nyeo, a character in the show, has her dialogue constantly mistranslated. Since she is supposed to be playing a low-income character who is determined and confident, she swears a lot and takes no bullshit. Mi-Nyeo’s one-off quotes get sanitized to be “more palatable,” but in turn, the audience loses the character’s values which can be picked up through speech.
Moreover, American audiences and K-drama fans are losing out on tropes that occur within Korean media. There is a point where the English translations suggest that Mi-Nyeo says, “I’m not a genius, but I still got it to work out. Huh.”
This in reference to Mi-Nyeo stating she was able to figure out the challenge in the game. However, Youngmi says that what Mi-Nyeo actually says is, “I am very smart, I just never got a chance to study.”
According to Youngmi, this is a huge trope in K-dramas, as there is more often than not a low-income character who is clever, witty and smart but was not given the opportunity to study. These tropes are probably things that fans of the genre look for, and they are the storylines that help non-Korean fans better understand recurring themes of Korean media.  
Even though these things seem like inconsequential details, they are meticulously thought out by the writers and creators. They are details that the audience is meant to know about it, to better understand the plot and to possibly relate to. 
Similarly, these translations could also serve as an educational tool for Korean culture. TikToker @hyuckstan02, explains Netflix’s subtitles fail to respect honorifics, which are titles used to express status or respect. In English, they are titles such as “Mrs.” or “Mr.” and even the more royal-like “Your Highness” or “Your Majesty.” 
@hyuchstan02 explains that a character named Sangwoo tells another character, Ali, to start calling him “hyung” instead of “sajangnim.” In Korean the word “hyung” is an honorific that means “older brother.” “Sajangnim” is a title that is equivalent to boss. 
In the subtitles, however, it shows that Ali goes from calling Sangwoo “boss” or “sir” to using his name. The audience loses the fact that they have created a brotherly bond. Their connection becomes deeper by going from calling someone a title to being on a first-name basis.   
There are plenty more analyses and theories about Netflix’s lack of effort when it comes to subtitles, but these two examples give enough information about some of the things that are lost in translation. 
This problem is much more serious than just an audience receiving a misconstrued version of a show; it is about honoring the integrity of an artist’s work. Time and time again, American media industries disregard non-English films. 
We saw this with the 2019 movie, “Parasite.” “The one-inch barrier” of subtitles, as director Bong Joon Ho put it, often becomes just that — a barrier. International films with subtitles tend to get less publicity or fewer views. Many people do not want to read subtitles either, becoming more of a hurdle toward non-English films getting the recognition they deserve. 
With “Squid Game,” it is encouraging to see international media is being watched and growing in popularity. However, there is still a barrier that remains. The hurdle of subtitles has been cleared, but the quality of these subtitles is being called into question. 
Thus, the writers, directors, producers and other staff whose whole lives have been working toward gaining a hit, are only putting a part of their story into the world. The messages, ideas and characters they want to share with the audience are being lost due, in part, to American media’s lack of attention to detail toward anything that isn’t in English. 
All I have to say is, do better Netflix. You are a multi-million dollar company that can afford to push back a show’s release if it means getting better translations. If not for the audience to better understand the plot of a show, do it out of respect for the piece of work and commentary the creators have worked tirelessly to create.

This is where the magic happens. On Wednesday evening, a diverse conglomerate of people with a shared interest in climate justice came together at the USC Fisher Art Museum. The event was called “Regenerate: Communities for climate justice — An evening of storytelling and art,” an accurate title which is poetry itself.
Many of the projects presented at the event were led by various students in the Arts and Climate Collective, a collaboration between USC Arts in Action, the USC Office of Sustainability and USC Annenberg Innovation Lab. 
The cohort of students was chosen to be a part of the Arts and Climate Collective’s pilot program in Spring 2021. Undergraduates and graduates across seven schools received a $1,000 grant to help propel their personal experiences and visions involving climate justice and sustainability into an intersectional medley of tangible stories. The result was podcasts, documentaries, short films and more, each completely student-run and containing unimaginable talent.
Cameron Audras described his project @the.resiliance.project as a “climate action performance series in eight movements that relates to the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals.” Inside the Fisher Art Museum, two of the eight movements in the Resilience Project, “Electricity” and “Transportation,” were presented and incorporated spoken word poetry with interpretive dance, an original soundtrack and visual storytelling.
For his piece, Audras and other collaborators thought about how today’s climate movement does not always present as universal.
“I wanted to see if we can somehow showcase all of the different facets of climate and how, at USC, we’re all studying all these different interdisciplinary but disciplinary subjects,” Audras said. 
Another Arts and Climate Collective awardee speaking at the event was Imani Johnson, a junior majoring in business administration, who founded the student-run podcast Eco Alarm. This podcast finds and amplifies the stories of people making positive environmental changes. 
Imani reckoned with sticking to her truth in a way that, from a climate warrior’s perspective, is typically associated with the opposition.
 “I could use the skills and understand [the industry] from within and still make change in an industry that, ultimately, we sometimes see as the enemy,” Imani said. “I think it’s been really eye-opening to see that there are other business majors who think the same way.”
Imani discovered it was crucial to be in a community of inspiring and supportive people. Especially in a college environment like USC, the incredible brain power and potential within the student body can go untapped without a clear direction of where to apply it. This need was a key motivator for USC research professor Colin Maclay in co-founding the Arts and Climate Collective in Spring 2021.
“In the lead up to Earth Month, we’d been doing all these interviews with cultural producers, with people who use culture for social change,” Maclay said. “And coming out of those conversations with students and faculty and community members and staff, we’ve heard this desire for students to be able to get involved and to be able to do things that serve their community.” 
Maclay remembered the experience of Hannah Findling, another co-founder of the Arts and Climate Collective, who despite being passionate about the environment did not know how to be involved.
The Regenerate event raised countless examples of places “to go to do the things,” as Maclay mentioned, and many are not within USC’s privileged gates. For example, a panel discussion inside the Fisher Art Museum brought in leaders of the People not Pozos, which is a grassroots campaign giving back power to local neighborhoods whose health is at severe risk from oil drilling. 
By inviting members of the South Central community to the event, invaluable conversations about socio-economic disparities intersecting with climate change were held with the people whose voices are simultaneously the most important and the least commonly heard.
Also on the panel was Nalleli Cobo, who told her story about growing up in University Park across the street from a toxic oil well, forcing her into her role as a climate justice activist at only nine years of age.
“When I was growing up, I had body spasms so severe, I couldn’t move … I had to sleep in a chair to not choke on my own blood at night,” Cobo said. “Asthma is something I’m always gonna have to live with. Headaches, stomach pains, I had it all.” 
Cobo is now “considered among the world’s most influential people in climate policy” by the Center for the Study of Political Graphics, and has recently been in remission from a cancer diagnosis. Her story and ability to recount it was enough to inspire action.
Nalleli ended the discussion by reminding the audience that “it’s never too early or too late to join activism.” 
Events like these are a reminder that there is always a space to get involved in climate justice. For some, the Arts and Climate Collective is that place. For others, activism can start with just listening to the stories that are being told. 
“It’s better to light one match than curse the darkness especially being a part of this collective, I feel like I’m surrounded by so many incredible individuals who all have the same goal as me and all know that we’re in the fight of our lives right now,” said Gwenan Walker, an Arts and Climate Collective grant recipient working on an animation love project. “Just knowing that I’m not alone and there’s thousands of matches out there, it doesn’t scare me anymore.”

Warning: The following review contains spoilers.
We all date shit people. But sometimes those shit people will show you Julia Ducournau movies on the fifth date, and you’ll forever be in a debt of gratitude.
Ducournau is a visionary, to say the absolute least. Her filmmaking knows no limit or standard. She melts genre and boundaries for any director or writer. 
Her feature debut, “Raw” (2016), is one of the best thrillers I’ve seen. The plot is engaging and keeps you guessing, so I could not wait to see her most recent work, “Titane.”
The movie begins with “Wayfaring Stranger” by 16 Horsepower playing. A young version of our leading protagonist, Alexia, excessively kicks her father’s car seat, leading the car to swerve and crash. 
The body horror begins quickly when we are shown a bloody surgery of the young Alexia. She receives a metal plate implant in her head. As she exits the hospital, she caresses the car and kisses it before getting inside. 
Smash cut to a bright neon car show. Alexia, now an adult played by Agathe Rousselle, enters. She smoothly pins her hair up with a single knitting needle-style hair pin. 
She effortlessly swipes on a blood red lipstick and peels off her outerwear to reveal herself in gold spandex and bright yellow fishnets. 
She hops onto a car and begins to dance — slow and sultry. She is beloved by the audience, and it’s clear she is a talent. The way she moves is captivating. 
After her performance concludes, she begins to sign autographs.
I noticed there was a pause in the body horror and I wondered how Ducournau would shock us next; five minutes later, my stomach turned inside out as Alexia showers next to a new dancer, Justine, who is played by Garance Marillier, the star of “Raw.”
Alexia’s hair becomes stuck in Justine’s nipple piercing. To say it was agonizing to watch is an understatement, she pulls her matted hair to no avail until Justine turns and Alexia rips it out — and I knew then we were back in Ducournau’s palm.
Alexia is followed out of the car show by a fan who wants her autograph. When he forces himself upon her, in what is a clearly swift and rehearsed move, she swipes out her hair pin and stabs it into his ear. 
The camera closes on the man’s face as he convulses and white pus pours out of his mouth. After it’s clear he is beyond dead, Alexia rolls her eyes, as if to say, “not this again.” 
She returns to the car show to shower again, but is disrupted when she hears a growl coming from the floor. 
With Alexia nude and dripping, her feet smack the empty floor until the car illuminates her body. She is inside the car as it begins to jolt, the scene implying intercourse with the automobile.
She goes to watch the news and the audience learns that she is a serial killer who has been on a murder rampage throughout the south of France. 
Now is where Ducouranu’s directing and writing truly shine. When watching her films you may be thinking, “How could it possibly get worse?” But it always does. 
In the midst of hooking up with the darling and sweet Justine, Alexia begins to gnaw on her nipple piercing. The sound is enough to make anyone with a soft stomach feel ill. Alexia runs away after Justine expresses anger about the pain. 
Each squelsh of flesh or ripping of cartilage is vomit-inducingly excellent, which is a nod to the talent of the sound team. 
Alexia doubles over and throws up, and Justine gives her a pregnancy test. It is revealed Alexia is pregnant.
Justine and Alexia begin to hook up again until, with another swift swipe of the hairpin, Justine meets the same fate. Alexia makes her way through Justine’s roommates murdering all but one. 
She curses and returns home in bloody puss and bile stained clothes; she sets fire to the clothing but as the fire grows out of control, she watches with wonder. 
Enthralled by the flame, she pauses before deciding her next move. She runs into her home and locks her parents inside. 
The second act is where most films go to die, and “Titane” does falter here. I continued to be mesmerized by the story, but the main tension is so stressful you stay engaged. 
Alexia hitchhikes her way to town and finds a train station where she decides to take on the identity of a missing boy, Adrien. 
She binds her pregnant body and shaves her head. But she knows she will need more, so she bashes her head into the sink.
We are now introduced to Adrien’s father Vincent, portrayed by Vincent Lindon. He is clearly a broken man who hopes reconnecting with his son will fill the void in his life. 
Now the main tension of the second act is introduced: Will Alexia’s lie be uncovered? 
He rescues Alexia and takes her under his wing. Their relationship is cold at first. Vincent is a complicated man, and it is soon shown that he is using steroids to maintain his fitness as a fire chief. 
Alexia lives as a mute Adrien, abusing Vincent’s love. Her body is now raw from the binding. Ducournau creates empathy within the audience for her antihero, Alexia, and sympathy for the flawed but good Vincent. 
The visuals remain hypnotic with lighting used to elevate the scenes.
I found myself wanting Alexia to reveal herself to Vincent because it’s the age-old story a parent or guardian’s love that is transferable within film. 
In a tender moment, Alexia returns home to find Vincent in a comatose state on the bathroom floor. She pulls out her hairpin but fails to perform the deed. Alexia shifts and even though she is still a serial killer abusing an old man’s love, the audience is rooted in her story. We want her to change. 
The goal of making a successful film is to have the audience bond with your plot. Ducournau executes this flawlessly. 
I was aghast; I was rooting for the murderous Alexia. The movie continues with Adrien and Vincent growing close. They play the role of parent and child to the point of reality. 
Vincent sees Alexia’s naked, pregnant and tattered figure.  Despite that, he promises to continue caring for her. 
In this moment, the serial-killer-car-sex-having main character could recieve a moment of heartwarming joy from the audience, transitioning the film’s brutal body horror to a heartwarming story of unconditional love. 
The body horror continues as Alexia’s stomach rips to reveal a metal skeleton under her skin. Instead of blood, her wounds seep thick black oil. 
I was horrified, mystified and feeling warm and fuzzies all at once.  I was beyond enthralled. Ducournau’s execution of her own script with her thoughtful and detail-oriented directing is perfection. 
She shys away from nothing. The movie showcases some of the most brutal deaths I have ever witnessed on screen — Every moment is choreographed and oozes cinema. 
Each puff of a cigarette is just as much art as each brain-impaling murder. 
Talk about crying, screaming and throwing up — the sound design in this film will have you doing all three. Welcome to the new definition of metalhead. 
Ducournau redefines what it means to create and properly execute a horror film. Using the word “subvert” would be an insult to her work. Her grace when displaying pain and obscene amounts of gore cannot continue to fly under the radar. 
“Titane” is out in theaters now.

After nearly two years away from campus as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, staffers at the three USC residential dining halls returned at the start of the 2021-2022 school year to serve thousands of students daily. Since the dining halls reopened, long lines, unexpected weekend closures and food shortages have taken place because of understaffing. 
Three employees from the USC Village Dining Hall spoke to the Daily Trojan about understaffing at the residential dining halls on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about job security.
One staffer spoke about navigating the long hours he’s assigned to work. 
For nearly seven years, the staffer woke up before sunrise to drive across the city and clock in at the USC Village. Now, he can rely on their seniority to land the breakfast shift, which he says is preferable to the dinner shift, when more students come in to eat. But when the pandemic hit and campus closed, that all changed.
After the first stay-at-home orders came into effect across Los Angeles County, the University negotiated with the dining staff’s union, Unite Here Local 11, to pay the employees’ salaries in full for the first six months of lockdown. After those six months passed, however, the anonymous staffer, who supports himself and helps out his parents and grandmother, had to search for a new source of income. 
According to the anonymous staffer and other co-workers, many people who worked in the dining halls before the pandemic didn’t return this fall. Some didn’t come back because they weren’t rehired by the University, they said. Others, staffers said, didn’t reapply. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Miguel Jauregui, the director of Unite Here Local 11, said the union has been speaking to the University about the understaffing at the residential dining halls “for a while now,” but they “haven’t reached any clear resolutions.” 
“We’ve filed some complaints, but we don’t have any movement from [the University’s] part,” Jauregui said. 
According to Jauregui, the union wants USC to “call workers back” and “hire some more people.” Jauregui also said he hopes the student body will get involved with the issue and “voice their concerns” about the understaffing. 
According to Dirk De Jong, the assistant vice president of USC Hospitality and the USC Hotel, as of Oct. 5, 67 people work at the USC Village Dining Hall, 56 people work at EVK and 57 people work at the Parkside Restaurant & Grill dining hall. De Jong also reported that there are currently three open positions at the USC Village, 13 at EVK and 12 at Parkside.
Before the coronavirus pandemic, there were 63 staffers at the Village, 64 staffers at EVK and 60 staffers at Parkside. 
USC Hospitality sent out a campuswide email Aug. 23 addressing limited hours and unexpected closures, in part, because of understaffing. 
“Due to unforeseen challenges, we were unable to have all Campus Dining venues open prior to the first day of classes, and we understand the frustration that this has caused,” the email read. “We sincerely apologize.”
Another anonymous USC Village dining hall chef applied to work at USC because they wanted to learn about catering and try something new. They learned to cook from their grandmother and worked as a chef for six years before coming to USC at the start of the fall semester 2021. The chef, similarly to the other anonymous staffer, wakes up at 3:45 a.m. daily to work the morning shift. They said they like the early mornings: In their words, if you like being a chef, inconveniences like that “don’t matter.” 
But according to the chef, the number of employees in the dining hall currently is not enough to keep up with the necessary level of output. 
“Yeah, we’re understaffed here,” they said. “We need one more [worker].” 
The USC Village Dining Hall services upward of 2,000 students every day but currently has only two dishwashers per shift, another staffer said, half the amount typically assigned to a shift before the pandemic. 
The chef said there aren’t many people who apply online for the jobs offered at the dining hall and that it’s “really hard” to find people to employ. 
These worker shortages aren’t unique to the dining halls or to the University. Experts say millions more who lost their jobs at the beginning of the pandemic aren’t returning to work because they relocated to more affordable places to live. 
On Sept. 24, USC Hospitality hosted a hiring fair in search of filling up more of the open positions at the dining halls. USC Hospitality also plans to host another hiring fair Oct. 8. 
When contacted by the Daily Trojan, the University declined to comment on the understaffing at its dining halls. 
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the name of the local union “Unite Here Local 11” as “USC Unite Here Local 11.” The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Annabel Street and Celia Wood are two first-year students of contrasting backgrounds – a recurring theme that speaks to the incoming freshman class’s broader makeup. 
Annabel Street, a freshman majoring in international relations, opened her admission decision at her boarding school in Maine. 
“I was by myself in my room and opened up the portal – I remember being really excited, and I ran to go tell one of my friends – I was just really thrilled,” Street said. 
USC’s first-year class is the most “diverse and talented” group of students ever enrolled by the University, according to the USC Office of Admission. The class of 2025 broke numerous admission-related records, following an unparalleled 70,971 applications for the Fall 2021 admissions cycle. 
Of the 3,668 first-year students enrolled by the University, a record 23% are the first in their families to attend college – an increase from the 17% reported last year – and a 9% increase from 2011. A record 32% of first-year students come from historically underrepresented groups – a three-point increase from 2020. One in five first-year students identify as Latinx, and the number of Black students almost doubled to 9% – both increases from the previous year.
Despite improving diversity trends, Street said there is a lot more work to be done with increasing diversity on campus, particularly supporting low-income students. 
“I think there’s a lot to be done with diversity on campus primarily in terms of how to get students who come from [different] financial backgrounds,” Street said. “And once you have students like that on campus, how can we support them and make sure that this environment is one that will do as much for them, as it does for students with more privilege.”
In addition to diversifying the University’s student body, the class of 2025 hails from a variety of regions around the country and across the world. Among the enrolled class, all 50 states and 88 different countries are represented. California is the highest represented state in the freshman class, making up 42%, followed by New York, Texas, and Illinois. New Jersey and New York. Along with geographical diversity within the United States, 13% of the first-year class identify as international students – a slight uptick from the year before. Mexico, Canada, India, China and South Korea are the most represented countries among the class of 2025’s international student population. 
The class of 2025 shined as a particular standout for the admissions office, said USC Dean of Admissions Timothy Brunold in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
“A trend at USC is that each year the students just get better and better,” Brunold said. “This past year academically, the [freshman class] is absolutely more well prepared.” 
Among the first-year enrolled class, more than a fourth of students received “perfect grades” in high school, with a cumulative unweighted GPA of 3.83 – a tie with last year’s class for the highest average GPA in USC history. 
“We can see through the typical measures that we consider the kinds of classes that [students] engaged in high school, the curriculum they pursued, the grades they earned … just in terms of overall preparation and overall fit for the University, we felt that this was the group of students that [best] fit with what we’re trying to accomplish,” Brunold said. 
Brunold said the admissions office combs through thousands of applicants and pursues those who present an inclination to help achieve the University’s main objectives. 
“We’re always trying to achieve in the admission process by bringing students to the University who will help the University in its mission, its strategic objectives and most importantly, we’re looking to bring students whom the faculty want to teach,” Brunold said. “We feel like this class really checks all those boxes.”  
Despite the temporary suspension of the standardized testing requirement because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Brunold is “confident” that the first-year admitted class will be prepared for USC’s academic curriculum. He also said the office is reevaluating the role standardized testing plays in the admissions process and said that no permanent decision has been made on whether the requirement will be reinstated. 
“You can bet what we’re going to be doing over the next year or more is we’re going to be studying [this current] cohort of students very directly – because we’re always doing validity studies of our entering classes, and we’re always trying to make sure that the students we’re bringing to the University are prepared and having the kinds of outcomes that we want,” Brunold said. 
Street said she is excited to be a part of the first-year class. She credits the waived standardized testing requirement with recruiting the most talented class. 
“I think by waiving SAT requirements offered a lot more ways for students to be looked at, outside of their academic statistics, and so I think what when we talk about how this class is the most talented that is because we started recognizing this year that talent comes from a lot more areas than just how well you can do on a standardized test,” Street said. “I think it’s really exciting to be in classrooms with students whose abilities and talents come from a wide range of places.” 
13% of the USC freshman class are legacy students – meaning students with some kind of familial tie to the University. According to the 2020 USC common data set, admission officers consider a student’s alumni relations when reviewing an applicant’s credentials. Despite a national survey finding that seven in 10 college students feel the use of legacy admissions is “unfair,” Brunold said USC admissions officers consider legacy status to ensure Trojan families remain connected for future generations for the University. 
“We’ve always felt at USC that there was value in keeping Trojan Family legacies ongoing. When we see applicants who have some connection existing to the University, we do think it’s beneficial to keep that potential alive for future generations,” Brunold said. “But that being said, the role of legacy in our admissions process is not a defining factor … While being a legacy at USC is something that we track and we pay attention to, it’s not an overwhelming, defining factor in the reasonsomeone gets admitted.” 
Wood, a freshman majoring in animation and digital arts, is among the 13% of first-year students who identifies as a legacy student. One of her siblings graduated from USC and another is currently a senior at the University.
“I think it’s difficult because there is a stigma, like [some] think you don’t have to try to get in [if you’re a legacy,] and it’s difficult for the University to have a connection with their alumni while prioritizing the most adequate students for the class,” Wood said. “Having older siblings who went here helped me to know what the student body is like and to know what [the admissions office] was looking for.” 
Wood said there are only 14 people in her major but has already seen the depth and diversity within the student body.
“Just looking at my major alone, these are some of the most talented kids I’ve ever met –– it definitely feels good to be a part of this class,” Wood said.

Former USC linebacker Su’a Cravens joined USC football’s radio broadcast show for the 2021 season. Cravens met with the Daily Trojan to share his thoughts on his new job, his transition from player to media member and what USC football can do to get back to its winning ways. 
This interview was edited for length and clarity. 
Daily Trojan: When did you realize that you had an interest in media and broadcasting? 
Su’a Cravens: Growing up, I always used to watch College Football Live like every Saturday. I probably never missed an episode when I was maybe six years old. So I always had an interest in college football and being able to talk college football in the way that they did it. Seeing how the fans react to them picking teams and just talking about different teams, that was always an interest of mine. I just never thought it’d be an actual reality to be able to broadcast or commentate on college football. When I got the opportunity from USC, it was almost like a dream come true. I’ve always had an interest in something like this.
D.T.: How does your experience as a player translate to your game preparation as a broadcaster? 
S.C.: It definitely helps because I can look at things that maybe your average fan wouldn’t see. I can bring that to light and help people understand the game from a perspective that I looked at, so that they can maybe get a different version of what they’re used to seeing. But sometimes that can hurt too because I know that people don’t really know all the X’s and O’s of football. 
If you try to get too into detail and too complicated with it, you’ll lose the viewers. You’re speaking a different language at that point. It helps when it comes to pointing out unique perspectives, but it also can hinder you because you don’t want to speak in another language because they are fans at the end of the day. They weren’t in the locker room, in the meetings, going over X’s and O’s their whole lives.
D.T.: Do you have anyone, I guess it could be yourself, but maybe even a close friend or a family member that listens to you as a broadcaster and gives you tips? 
S.C.: I actually get a lot of feedback from my lady. Every time I have a show she’ll be watching it with my kids. When I come home, she’ll give me pointers like, “You need to add some more of your sauce here. You need to add some more of your own swag right there. You sound too cookie cutter.”
I always hear her voice in my head. Whenever I’m on set, I’m trying to just be like, “Add a little something here. Add a little flavor here.”
D.T.: With the increased popularity and media attention that comes around high school football recruiting, and the concept of three-stars and four-stars, how do you think that’s changed the sport? Specifically, how has that impacted USC?
S.C.: I think we put too much too much on the ratings of recruits. I know plenty of guys who were five-stars coming out of high school who were absolute garbage and didn’t translate to the college level and didn’t ever see the field as a five-star. And I know three-star guys who barely got recruited, who turned out to be NFL Hall of Famers. I think we put too much hype on “stars” and trying to make guys feel a little bit more important than they are because, when you get to college, none of that matters. 
When it comes to recruiting, especially with USC, they’re wowed by the big name and the big splash recruit. But they take that five-star label and run with it instead of actually doing the work and finding out who really is a five-star, who really is a dog.
D.T.: What do you think USC could be doing better, in your opinion, to get back to winning or at least contending for the Pac-12 and national championships year in [and] year out?
S.C.: I think we need to stop worrying about being politically correct and stop worrying about what our image looks like. Once we started caring about that is when things started heading downhill. I know when Lynn Swann was [athletic director] and when Pat Haden was [athletic director] that was their major thing: “We do things the right way.” 
I’m not saying that’s the wrong thing to say. Of course we’re gonna do things the right way, but when doing things the right way means we don’t care about sports because we’re academics first, I know it’s not the thing to say but that’s just not true. 
USC is a sports school and USC is a great place to be when their sports teams are winning. It doesn’t matter if every single student at USC had a 4.0. If our sports are garbage, people are not going to go to USC. That’s just the simple fact of it. 
I felt like for a while USC was trying to be Stanford and trying to build up that reputation of “We’re academics, and we just happen to be good at football.” No, no. We are a sports school, and USC’s football is what leads this school. I feel like we got away from that when we made football and recruiting and developing players and just overall athletics, we put that on the back burner, and we didn’t make that a priority, and I think we’ve suffered the consequences because of that.
D.T.: I think it was the Ohio State quarterback, Cardale Jones, who said he went to Ohio State to play football and not to play school. 
S.C.: That’s what I’m saying. I’m not saying, “Don’t go to class, school is bad” and all that. I’m not saying that at all. But they really got to the point where I would hear the [athletic director] say, “We are an academic school that happens to be good at athletics.” 
I couldn’t disagree more. I’m like, “No, we’re an athletic school that happens to be good at academics.”
D.T.: Is there anything that you want to leave a lasting impression on [with] this Q&A? I’ll leave you with the floor.
S.C.: Come to the games. Be patient with the football team, changes are coming. And fight on, per usual.

Guests will now be required to show proof of full vaccination, meaning they have received all necessary doses for at least two weeks, or present a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours to enter campus or the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for Saturday’s football game against Utah, Athletic Director Mike Bohn announced in a communitywide memo Tuesday. The game is also during Trojan Family Weekend. 
The change comes as the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health updated its protocols for Outdoor “Mega Events.” Those who are under 12 years old are exempt from this policy.
Additional guest requirements include showing a compliant Trojan Check requirement to enter campus and as well as a government-issued photo ID card for those 18 years and older.
If you already verified your vaccination or negative test on campus, you will be given a wristband so you will not have to go through the same process again at the Coliseum. 
Facial coverings remain required during the tailgate and at the Coliseum except when consuming food or beverages. 
Tailgating on campus remains the same as previous home games through USC’s reservation system. This is still in place to maintain low-density levels at USC and permit those who are only allowed to tailgate.
USC students, staff and faculty who want to get onto campus Saturday will only have to present their Trojan Check and are not subject to the vaccination and testing requirements.
In order to summarize the gameday health guidelines for guests, Bohn also announced the creation of a centralized web page that lists these protocols for visitors. 
Specifically, the web page discusses the rules for both indoor and outdoor events at the Galen Center and L.A. Coliseum, respectively as well as on USC’s campus. Additionally, it offers resources to LA county testing and vaccine sites and how to verify vaccination statuses and negative test results. Lastly, it has a FAQ section to answer any questions that guests may have.

Two hundred and sixty four days. That’s how long it has been since USC has won a Pac-12 home game — the last time being Dec. 6 against Washington State.
The game feels like a distant memory for the Trojans. USC though will look to end its home losing streak and get back-to-back wins for the first time this season as it welcomes Utah to the Coliseum. 
For USC, inconsistency has been the only consistency this season. The Trojans have experienced the highs of winning their last two road games by a combined 54 points, along with the lows of losing their last two home games by a combined 29 points. 
Interim Head Coach Donte Williams spoke about what he wants the team to carry over to find consistency. 
“Controlling the line of scrimmage,” said Williams after practice Tuesday. “Let’s have an energetic sideline and let’s be energetic on the field. I want that to carry over not just for the next game but the rest of the season.”
Controlling the line of scrimmage was key in USC’s win over Colorado last week. Senior running back Keaontay Ingram had the first 100- yard rushing game for USC since December 2020. 
At practice this week, Offensive Coordinator Graham Harrell spoke about how Ingram seems to be coming into his own these past couple of weeks. 
“I think he’s just getting back to health and getting back to what we saw before he tweaked the hamstring,” Harrell said. “That’s big for us. The more guys we have that are good with the ball in their hands that’s good for us.” 
One of those guys is junior wide receiver Drake London. The Biletnikoff Award front-runner is second in the nation with 48 receptions and 670 receiving yards and made a one-hand touchdown snag last week. 
For London, the catch was not too much of a surprise.
“At that moment I was surprised,” London said. “But looking back at it, I made a couple plays at practice like that before. I don’t think it’s as much of a surprise now as it was.” 
London and the offense will be taking on a young secondary this week against Utah. The Utes have two freshman corners on the outside with Faybian Marks and Clark Phillips III. 
Phillips III is a former Ohio State commit and the highest ranked Utah commit in program history. London and Phillips III will be a matchup to watch on the outside. 
The Utes are coming off a 24-13 win two weeks ago against Washington State. Utah found success running the ball with former Oklahoma Sooner and Southern California-native junior running back TJ Pledger. 
Pledger came in the second half after freshman starting running back Micah Bernard went out with an upper body injury. Pledger had over 100 yards and one touchdown on nearly 12 yards a carry. The Trojans will need to stymie the run game and control the former Mission League Offensive player of the year.
Like every team USC has played this season, there’s been some quarterback shuffling with sophomore Cameron Rising making his first start against the Cougars since USC in November 2020. 
Williams believes the week off gives Rising that extra time to settle into the offense.
“Their guys will be fresh, that’s the biggest challenge,” Williams said. “At the same time they pretty much settled in on their quarterback. He’s had two weeks to prepare for us.” 
Hanging on to the ball was a major problem for the Utes against Washington State, fumbling seven times despite the win. The Trojans defense has forced four fumbles so far. 
Keeping flags off the field is the biggest obstacle at home for the Trojans. In the Trojans’ two home games under Williams, they have committed a combined 23 penalties for 223 yards. 
After practice on Tuesday, Williams had everyone who was on Howard Jones Field run 12 sprints for the 12 penalties last week. This included Associate Athletic Director Brandon Sousa. It’ll be interesting to see if this discipline at practice can translate Saturday night. 
Utah is coming into this week with time off. The Utes spent the bye watching the Trojans, but it was with heavy hearts. 
The Utah community tragically lost sophomore cornerback Aaron Lowe as he was shot and killed at a house party after the Washington State game two weeks ago. 
Head Coach Kyle Whittingham spoke about how challenging the last two weeks have been for the team after the loss of a teammate. 
“Extremely difficult to say the least,” Whittingham said. “Fortunately, we had a bye week last week to regroup … and come to terms with the tragedy. It’s challenging.” 
Lowe had changed his number from two to 22 in the offseason and was the first recipient of the Ty Jordan Memorial Scholarship. Jordan, who wore the number 22, was last year’s Pac-12 Freshman Offensive Player of the Year for Utah and tragically lost his life last Christmas just a week after the season.
Utah comes into town looking for its first win at the Coliseum since 1916. The Utes have lost the last two matchups in Los Angeles by an average of just 4 points. 
For Williams and the team, the key to ending the home conference losing streak and taking down a rested Utah team will be staying aggressive for the entire 60 minutes. 
“We have to stay hungry, we have to be locked in the whole time,” Williams said. “You have to get on edge and stay on edge.” 
Kickoff is Saturday at 5 p.m.

USC legend and former quarterback Carson Palmer, who was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in January, will be honored Saturday at the Coliseum during the Trojans’ upcoming game against Utah. 
The 6-5, 235-pound quarterback struggled during the first three seasons of his collegiate career, but exploded his senior year, winning the 2002 Heisman Trophy on the back of an 11-2 record and setting USC up for a decade of prominence. 
“I’m most excited to run out of the tunnel,” said Palmer on USC’s radio show “Trojans Live.” “I’m excited to be honored at halftime, but I’m really excited to lead the team out of the tunnel.”
Palmer will look to recapture some of the excitement from the good old days, when he threw 3,639 yards and 32 touchdowns in his Heisman-winning season. He went on to win MVP in USC’s 2003 Orange Bowl victory over Iowa, giving the Trojans a No. 4 ranking — their highest finish in the polls since 1979. 
Some of Palmer’s success can be attributed to a coaching change at the turn of the century. Athletic Director Mike Garrett decided Head Coach Paul Hackett’s 19-18 record over two seasons wasn’t cutting it, choosing to instate Pete Carroll for the 2001 season, who went on to coach the Trojans until 2009. 
“This was such a great group for Pete to come into,” Palmer said. “He was coming into a team that wasn’t really good but had some great leadership … That leadership bought in to all of Pete’s fun, corny but positive stuff. You gotta have that leadership buy into that style.”
Palmer was able to fully flourish under Carroll his senior year after having a tough start in  collegiate football. 
As a freshman in 1999, Palmer started the final five games of the season, throwing for 1,755 passing yards and seven touchdowns, but sky-high expectations fell to the floor when Palmer suffered a season-ending collarbone injury early sophomore year. He redshirted his sophomore season in 2000, throwing more interceptions (18) than touchdowns (16) in the season. Chances of Palmer reaching his full potential looked bleak after an unmemorable junior season in 2001, where he threw for 13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. 
Enter offensive coordinator Norm Chow. Chow, who was brought in with Carroll’s staff in 2001, coached the Trojans’ offense until 2004. With Chow’s guidance, Palmer began to see the whole field and read defenses at a higher level, raising his and the team’s level of play. 
Chow was so instrumental in Palmer’s dominant 2002 season some even suggested the NFL team that drafts Palmer should add Chow to its coaching staff. 
Palmer is no stranger to coaching changes at the collegiate level. When Hackett was ousted and Carroll was brought in, Palmer had to change the way he looked at football. 
Fast forward almost 20 years later, the Trojans find themselves in a similar situation — Clay Helton gone and interim Head Coach Donte Williams left to clean up the scraps. It can be especially difficult for a young quarterback such as junior Kedon Slovis, since it’s only been two seasons with new offensive coordinator Graham Harrell. 
“It’s obviously tough because there is so much change, change of terminology, change of the program and really everything,” Palmer said. “But there is something exciting and refreshing about it, that change is sometimes good. It’s a whole new system to learn and more things to experience from a quarterback’s perspective, especially.”
Palmer got off to a slow start his senior year under Carroll, beginning the 2002 season with a 3-2 record before going on a blistering seven-game win streak to reach the 2003 Orange Bowl. Similarly, this season’s USC team finds itself with a 3-2 record, a new coach at the reins and the entire fanbase looking for some signs of positive change. 
Slovis and his squad will look to kick off a Palmer-esque win streak with the newly-inducted College Football Hall of Famer in attendance Saturday as they take on the Utes at 5 p.m.

No. 1 USC hosts No. 5 Cal Saturday in the Trojans’ first Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match of the season. The Trojans will head to Irvine Sunday to play No. 12 UC Irvine in their second match of the weekend. 
USC hopes to keep up its undefeated record and win its 12th and 13th games of the season.
USC easily handled No. 6 Pacific last weekend, beating the Tigers with a score of 16-9. The Trojans never trailed in the game and looked comfortable the entire time. Graduate transfer 2-meter Wyatt Barker, a former Tiger, and redshirt junior driver Hannes Daube each notchedhat-tricks in the win as USC got their 11th win of the year.
Looking ahead to this weekend, USC aims to repeat their victory against Cal from the MPSF Invitational Final last season, where they beat the Golden Bears 12-11. The all-time head-to-head record between the two teams is very close, with USC beating the Golden Bears 68 times and losing 63 times. 
Cal has only one other loss besides the loss to USC, so their form has not dropped since these two teams last met. If the MPSF final is any indicator for this game, it should be a tight matchup.
Head Coach Marko Pintaric hopes USC will improve from the last time the two teams played.
Pintaric wants the Trojans to “be more aware for the whole four quarters … not have periods of the game where we kind of wander off, especially when we have the lead.” 
Senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt said the team watched plenty of tape on Cal in preparation for this weekend as they are expecting a tough match.
“I see them coming out with way more aggression than we’ve seen all season,” Ehrhardt said. “They’re going to come back much stronger than we’ve seen all season.”
 After playing Cal, the Trojans will face off against UC Irvine for the first time this season. USC has beaten the Anteaters the last 33 times they have faced off, having last lost to them in the 2004 season. 
The Anteaters have a 7-6 record this season, and having only one win against a ranked team, they will look to pull off quite the upset against the No. 1 ranked Trojans.
USC has been very solid defensively so far this season as they’ve only allowed 7.2 goals per game. Senior goaltender Nic Porter leads the MPSF in saves per game with 11.3. USC hopes to continue that trend this week as it faces two very strong offensive teams.
“Blackout focus in the program is always defense first … it’s a team system we play in our defense and that’s really been anchoring us to the success we’ve had so far,” Porter said. “This week our preparations have been focusing on our defense and making sure that’s really sharp.” 
USC hosts Cal at 12 p.m. Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatic Center and will face UC Irvine Sunday at 1 p.m.

When Colorado’s beloved mascot, Ralphie, rushed the field last Saturday, it told the tale of a USC team that would do all the rushing — 218 yards to be exact — in its dominant win.  
Through five games, we’ve seen two versions of this squad. The one that’s been victorious on the road, and the other that’s been, well, not as victorious at home.
On the road, USC performs like Alabama, dominating opponents for the most part. And at home, the Trojans perform like a high school varsity team, outmatched by opponents who seem more prepared and willing to fight. 
It’s frustrating for Trojan fans, but it’s what USC football has become: always unpredictable and fairly never reliable. 
Much is still left in the air in terms of Pac-12 supremacy. USC’s matchup against Utah Saturday will be a true test to see if maybe, just maybe, this squad can turn a 3-2 start into a memorable season. 
The Trojans had their chance against Oregon State after a strong performance on the road against Washington State. We all know how that went, as the Beavers notched 535 total yards to steamroll through USC. 
Utah has been alright at best, securing wins against Washington State and Weber State University and taking close losses to BYU and San Diego State. The Utes have allowed only 304 yards per game, second-best in the Pac-12, and held the Cougars to 26 points, their second-lowest total of the season. 
It’s a tough matchup, but one USC can’t afford to lose, not now, not next week or the week before. 
Traveling to Notre Dame after a bye week and losing to Utah is not an ideal situation. USC can find itself below a .500 win percentage before playing Pac-12 South foes like Arizona and Arizona State in back-to-back weeks. 
If the Trojans drop this game against Utah, consider their season done. No more hype for interim Head Coach Donte Williams, no bowl game to salvage an already deplorable season and no more stating USC is a perfect gig for coaches. 
If the Trojans drop this game against Utah, consider their Pac-12 race finished, along with their Pac-12 Championship hopes, USC fans’ visions of tailgates at Allegiant Stadium and dreams of USC winning its first conference title since 2017. 
It’s all or nothing Saturday, and nothing can’t be an option. 
A lot hangs in the balance for USC when it comes to Saturday’s game against Utah. The Utes are the first team the Trojans will face from the Pac-12 South. Dropping this game puts them in a precarious position in their division, where they’ll need other schools to defeat the leaders in the South.
(Remember, the Pac-12 championship is between the Pac-12 North and South champion.)
As of now, Arizona State seems to be the best in the South, especially after its strong victory against UCLA last weekend. The Sun Devils and Bruins will test the Trojans with their dynamic run game, and just ask fans at the Oregon State game how much USC struggles with that. Losing to either one of those schools immediately eliminates USC from a shot at the championship game. 
Those two games against Arizona State and UCLA are must-wins, but, for now, the least USC can do is beat Utah Saturday. It goes back to the main point of my column — even though the Trojans 3-2 record looks bleak, they are in charge of their own destiny. 
It’s all about going 1-0 Saturday, the mantra that Williams and many players have adopted. I’ve adopted it too, saying I’m going 1-0 after eating more food than I should. Everything just sounds much better when you say it like that. Maybe I’m going 1-0 with this column…. 
But, back to the topic. 
USC has looked like the better team through five games, despite its horrible losses to Stanford and Oregon State. The offense seems to be clicking more week by week. Even in the loss against the Beavers, the Trojans’ problem was primarily their defense’s inability to get a stop, not the inconsistency of the offense.
Then there’s Kedon Slovis. Oh, Slovis. The junior quarterback looked great against Colorado, a welcoming sight for haters like me. Whether he can keep it up is the question, but he seems to be on a mission to prove his worth. 
Junior wide receiver Drake London has been just completely ridiculous. He’s notched over 100 receiving yards in four of USC’s first five games. 
Add on to the fact that this run game is looking glorious, and you’ve got an offense more like a traditional Trojan one — an explosive rushing attack, a top-five receiver and a supporting cast that would be stars at other schools. 
The ball is, literally and figuratively, in USC’s hands to change the course of its season into more memorable than forgettable.
Will the Trojans actually do it?

With no fall breeze, girls have yet to start dressing like stereotypical midwestern baddies. While there are no big scarves or thigh-high leather boots in sight, time is ticking. We all know what’s coming — cuffing season.
The 90 degree weather has Trojans hot and ready to form one-and-done sexual connections. When the heat is over though, how sustainable is that lifestyle when what you really want is to cuddle with someone in front of the Parkside outdoor bonfire? 
Not sure how to smoothly transition into this upcoming cuffing season? Dr. Blingspice has you covered with advice that will help even the loneliest USCuties find a special someone to comfort them through the chaotic semester.
I hooked up with a guy and we had a real connection. How long after should I wait for him to text? When do I drop him and forget about him? I became too attached. 
While I’m a firm believer in men doing the heavy lifting in most situations, I’m also an advocate for people securing the bag on their own terms. Anticipating a text from your hookup puts you in a vulnerable state of anxiety when your phone buzzes, only for you to be left with a growing void every time it’s not him. Take matters into your own hands and initiate the conversation. Be a girlboss and give him a heart attack when he receives your message.
Being a girlboss comes with risks. Prepare for rejection because the foundation of your interaction with the man was initially just sex. Unless both of you expressed any intention to pursue a connection beyond coitus, your shots could possibly backfire, in which case I encourage you to find yourself another chiseled man — there are plenty along Trousdale. With your confidence, unless I’m mistaking it for dicknosis — hypnosis by the male genitalia — I’m sure the connection is mutual. If so, I really encourage you to take the risk and start plotting.
I’ve been dating my girlfriend for years. We are both living in Los Angeles, so distance isn’t an issue. Recently, a new girl has popped into my life, and I can’t stop thinking about her. I still love my girlfriend, but I’m crushing on this new girl. Is this normal and what can I do about it? 
A short-distance relationship with a girlfriend you’ve been dating for years and you are tempted to toss that away for a side piece you just met; the human brain sometimes morphs into a can of beans when we least expect it. To answer your question, this is normal. You can’t control your emotions, but what you decide to do about your newfound attraction can certainly be a judgement of your character. 
Think about the amount of time, effort and money you’ve invested into your relationship and ponder how unfortunate it would be to let it all collapse because of another woman you just met. For your next step, list every imperfection and what you despise most about the new girl until you develop a distaste. You can make anyone seem unfathomably unattractive if you try hard enough. 
The alternative is to avoid spending time with the girl until your butterflies for her wither away. If she messages you asking to go on a Dulce brunch date with her, you respond: “Sorry, I’m busy checking the water pressure in my apartment building.” Did she message you asking to have a late night study session? Have a text ready saying: “Sorry bestie, I’m eating breakfast.” Curve the girl every chance you get until you get over your lovesickness and can pay full attention to your girlfriend.
I think I’m in love with someone and don’t know how to tell them.
Depending on what your current relationship is with the beloved, ask them to get a meal or coffee one-on-one and gauge whether the attraction is mutual. Once you get a feel for whether they think of you as a friend or a love interest, then attack — subtly — with hints that you like them. If they respond well to your flirtatiousness, you’ll eventually build up the confidence to tell them your true feelings. 
You can also have a Jay Gatsby moment and throw a function for the sole purpose of telling your personal “Daisy” that you admire them. As a warning, this option is a lot more bold, but if you get rejected, you’ll have host duties that will distract you from the heartbreak. If the mission is a success, you will have thrown a rager and have a brand new lover to celebrate with. 
If you need advice, feel free to reach out to Dr. Blingspice by direct messaging Daily Trojan on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook or by submitting your questions to the Google Form on the Instagram stories.

Content Warning: This article contains references to sexual assault. 
There is no question Greek life embeds the social scene at USC. Although fraternities and sororities offer an alluring facade, the so-called “auspicious organizations” have also played an active role in the exponentially rising rates of sexual assault on college campuses nationally. Moreover, while it is almost a given that fraternity parties will include alcohol, the distribution of this party essential perpetuates this misogyny. 
At USC, Greek life flourishes. The National Panhellenic Conference, which guides 26 sororities across North America, represents more than four million women; however, their rules and values are stuck in a time when women’s rights were questioned to a greater extent than now.
The NPC banned alcohol in 1975, claiming their goals and values aligned best with an alcohol-free environment; therefore, any alcohol-related activities are completely banned in sororities, in theory. 
However, it is 2021 and the parties haven’t stopped. There’s a catch: This rule does not extend to fraternities. Not only does this blatant sexism feed into toxic drinking culture, but it also reveals USC and Greek life members’ complacency in perpetuating sexism. 
The tangible impacts of this rule are overwhelming. If a sorority wishes to host an event, it may not do so with any agency and must ask fraternities for help. Put another way: Women cannot host a common Greek life party without men’s involvement. 
Since fraternities control alcohol distribution, this dynamic contributes to sexual assault cases. According to a study published in the NASPA journal, women in sororities are 74% more likely to be raped than their peers. In fact, AlcoholEdu reports 26% of USC students report consuming alcohol at fraternities. Fraternities seem to acknowledge the discrepancies in sexual assault cases in Greek life, and its proposed solution was to limit the number of non-affialited fraternity members allowed in frat houses. Ironically, several studies have found men in fraternities are three times more likely to rape women. And while this does not equate every man in Greek life to a predator, the statistic speaks for itself.
These organizations’ plaguing misogyny is overwhelmingly disturbing. Because of the NPC’s outdated rules, women in sororities have merely one option if they choose to drink surrounded by their friends — a frat house. Instead of drinking in the comfort of their own home surrounded by women they know, women in sororities must drink in a house full of drunk and unfamiliar men.
The expectation is a direct threat to the health and well-being of women at universities everywhere. The NPC’s rule extends to the gender norms present in Pre-Suffrage America — women are not strong or capable enough to take care of themselves. Because independence is nonexistent for these women, men must accompany them, regardless of sobriety.
To be clear, the solution is not throwing a bunch of White Claws and Four Lokos into every sorority house on the street, but we must address rule discrepancies solely based on organization members’ gender. The question remains: How does one change the sexism that has plagued these organizations for decades?
Firstly, Greek Life must either extend the NPC’s alcohol ban to fraternities or get rid of the ban altogether. There is absolutely no acceptable reason for a house of women to have expectations and consequences a house of men — who are part of the same umbrella organization — do not share. 
Considering drinking culture’s prominence on college campuses, revising Greek life’s alcohol policies is a start, but the blatant sexism does not stop there. Most sororities are not permitted to have men sleep over; instead, they are confined to common rooms as visitors. Sorority houses have varying times when they allow men in the house; however, fraternities do not deal with this problem. 
Right on trend, fraternities have no rules surrounding women guests regardless of timing or location. Essentially, a man can bring a woman into his own familiar environment, but this courtesy does not extend to the women living in the house next door. 
It is of utmost importance and urgency to change these rules and regulations surrounding women in Greek life. Sexism has a tight grasp on society and, clearly, the NPC; however, there is no reason why women in Greek life should suffer the consequences of these alarming and outdated rules. Women are not kids who need constant supervision or incapable beings who need men to hold them accountable. If the NPC can get behind this statement, then they are in desperate need of a new set of regulations.
