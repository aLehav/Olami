Earlier this month, it was uncovered that Facebook users’ privacy was breached by a third-party application: British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Since then, paranoid users have been deactivating their profiles in a nationwide #DeleteFacebook movement, and government leaders and private citizens alike have raised questions concerning the ethics behind Facebook’s handling of personal security. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is taking responsibility for the privacy breach to mitigate the backlash that has ensued. 
Amid all this controversy, it is discomforting to know that in a commercialized world, even our personal, private information is being used in the market; however, it would be foolish to overlook the immense benefits digital platforms already provide.
In the digital age, privacy is a minute concern for the teenage generation, the group tech giants are most interested in retaining. Thirty-seven percent of Instagram users are between the ages of 16 and 24, the highest of any other age group. Nearly 20 percent of Facebook users are also in this age group, with similar percentages for users up to 44 years old. 
Social media users often try to establish a balance between keeping their accounts private while also allowing public users to find and connect with them. Most users have a public profile picture, many making the names of the schools they attend and other basic factoids public. More “private” information is often only visible to friends whom they have connected with online. 
This is where the Cambridge Analytica scandal comes in: The company analyzed the profile data of millions of Facebook users after they consented by downloading an app that said their profile data would be used for “academic purposes.” But the crux of the scandal was that Cambridge Analytica was allegedly able to gain access to data of the app users’ friends as well, even though those friends never downloaded the app. 
This is, of course, a huge breach of trust and privacy, as Facebook itself admits. But a deeper analysis reveals the same could still happen to your account details today, just to a much smaller degree. The Facebook profile information that we want to keep private with the exception of our friends can still be transferred to non-friends with the touch of a button.

The entire idea of private Instagrams, for example, is meaningless because after you allow someone to follow your account and gain access to your photos and “private” information, you have no control over what that person does with your information. Anyone who follows your account can distribute to your information to anyone. 
What we can — and should be — objecting to is the storage of our data for monetary gain. We cannot be all that surprised that this takes place. In the age of print media, advertisers released unspecialized content to masses of potential consumers; now, buying personal data means that each advertisement is specific to a user’s interests. It is well-known that Google and Facebook store user data to create specifically targeted advertisements, and sell user information for advertising specificity.
For example, Amazon charges higher prices to customers whom they know are desperate to buy certain products. It’s a simple game of supply and demand, but thanks to our online presence, Amazon knows exactly what our demand is — and they can raise their price to just the right amount so we are forced to spend those extra dollars. 
We can ask our government to increase regulation of these tech giants, but it seems to be advocating just the opposite. Last year, the Trump administration removed the decades-old, bipartisan net neutrality agreement, which specifically barred internet providers from adjusting our streaming services to increase prices for consumers. 
The #DeleteFacebook movement, however, is a selfish response. It is a way of giving up and allowing Facebook and other tech giants to “regulate themselves.” In effect, it tells our government leaders that we are not interested in third-party regulation and that we would rather leave than see a solution to the problem. 
Deleting Facebook, as the hashtag encourages, would be foolish, as it fails to appreciate the many benefits of social media: maintaining connections worldwide, organizing events and uniting people through a common cause. 
Let’s not give up on social media because of this data breach. Let’s also not tell the government that we are willing to allow these giant tech companies to regulate themselves. Instead, let’s make use of social media’s countless benefits and pursue a fight to resolve the drawbacks.

What started as an exclusive network for Harvard students is now a billion-dollar company. And now, it’s in trouble — again — for exploiting its massive user base for information given without consent. Facebook is now embroiled in controversy regarding its providing of user data to the political data firm Cambridge Analytica to give to then-candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. And now, some Android users have noticed that Facebook has been furtively monitoring their text messages and phone calls, too. One Facebook user downloaded his Facebook data as a ZIP file and was shocked to find that Facebook had collected his call history, including the duration of phone calls, the identities of people he had called and those who had called him, along with the dates and times of incoming and outgoing phone calls going back for years. 
As just the latest example of users being exploited by Facebook, this scandal could be the breaking point: Maybe it’s time to delete Facebook. 
On Android and Facebook Lite devices, recent versions of Facebook Messenger explicitly request access to call logs and text message logs. That’s not so bad, even though many users might mistakenly opt-in if they misunderstand the purpose of the prompt. But here’s the kicker: According to Ars Technica, even if they didn’t opt in, Android and Facebook Lite users might have been unwittingly giving Facebook that information anyway. 
In a blog post, Facebook claimed that uploading call and text message logs has always been opt-in, even if, as Ars Technica points out, that narrative directly contradicts the experiences of Facebook users who found evidence of that data mining without their permission. It’s because, before the explicit request for permission for call and SMS logs instituted in 2016, the default installation of Facebook Messenger included an opt-in to give Facebook call and text message logs, and Facebook failed to notify users of this data collection. And even after Facebook instituted an express request for permission, that request did not ask for access to call logs or text message logs. Instead, Ars Technica reports that the platform gave users an “OK” button to approve “keeping all of your SMS messages in one place.”

By now, it’s clear that we really don’t know how much data we’re giving Facebook. The vagueness of privacy policies — and the fact that a fair few people actually read these policies, and even fewer understand them — has created an environment in which users blindly place confidence in Facebook’s benevolence. But even if we understand the policies that Facebook has made clear to us, the discovery that Facebook has been secretly harvesting our calls and text messages without permission is a clear indication that we should reconsider trusting them.
Our level of trust in Facebook to protect our privacy, when its business model centers on selling our information, is astounding. Facebook has power because it is ubiquitous; its accounts link to nearly every other interactive platform, including Yelp, Airbnb and Twitter. Users assume, then, that Facebook can’t be that bad, because it wouldn’t have over 2 billion users if that were the case. Young users in particular — users who have grown up in social media, sharing their thoughts, images and lives online — demonstrate considerable tolerance for privacy breaches, because they’re used to voluntarily giving up their privacy in exchange for social media interactivity. But Facebook has exploited this trust for too long. 
So let this be a wake-up call. If Facebook’s power lies in its ubiquity, then the financial sting of consumers leaving its platform might be the only significant motivator for Facebook to become truly transparent. Even if it isn’t, it will be a decisive show of consumer values that will influence the development of new platforms to instill a greater respect for consumer privacy.
Facebook brought connectivity to our lives; it allowed us to find long-lost classmates and stay in touch with old friends. It allowed us to, for the first time, begin to create our online lives and memories that we share with others. But the platform also brought social media addiction, unhealthy comparisons between ourselves and others and, of course, the chilling commodification of our personal information and identities.
If consumers continue to reward companies that breach their privacy, tech companies will only continue to mine our online identities for personal information that churns a massive profit when sold to consulting firms and advertising agencies. With Facebook, users have an opportunity to disrupt the New Age model of revenue building. If we collectively leave Facebook, we send the message that we will not accept platforms that secretly collect our personal information. More than that, we tell the world that we will not condone the distillation of our personhood into information regarding demographic characteristics, personality traits and interests that can be bought and sold. That powerful statement could change the way that social media platforms build and operate. 
Facebook users — there are 2 billion of us: Let’s make our voices heard. Sonali Seth is a senior majoring in policy, planning and development. “Point/Counterpoint” runs Wednesdays.

Love, Simon tells the story of Simon Spier, a suburban teenager living a “totally normal life,” with the exception of one big secret: Nobody knows he is gay. Based on the best-selling novel, Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, the movie explores Simon’s chaotic coming-out journey as he falls in love online with another closeted student from his school, who anonymously goes by Blue. However, when Simon is unexpectedly outed by another student at the school who found his correspondences with Blue, he’s forced to deal with the repercussions.
Nick Robinson (left), plays Simon Spier, a teenage boy who is struggling to come to terms with his sexuality. Katherine Langford (right), plays his supportive best friend, Leah Burke. Photo from IMDB.
Nick Robinson offers an incredible performance in his portrayal of Simon. From awkward encounters with straight friends to painful attempts at flirting with guys, Robinson’s perfect comedic timing captures the awkwardness of Simon’s tale. He simultaneously captures the emotional torment that accompanies hiding behind a facade for years, and the insecurity and self-doubt in a character struggling to admit his sexuality even to himself.
Director Greg Berlanti successfully fosters an extremely lighthearted and comedic atmosphere throughout the film, to complement the script written by Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker. Comedy played out perfectly in the film, particularly with one-liners and monologues delivered by Ms. Albright (Natasha Rothwell), the drama teacher. The audience roared with laughter with every joke, even applauding after several retorts to bullies from Ethan (Clark Moore), the school’s only openly gay student. Despite the serious subject matter, the movie never loses this sense of comedy.
The film’s original soundtrack, curated primarily by Jack Antonoff, the pop mastermind behind some of Taylor Swift and Lorde’s most successful songs, is deserving of praise. Currently the lead singer and songwriter of Bleachers and member of Fun., Antonoff helped write original songs for the film for singers Troye Sivan and MØ, as well as his own band, Bleachers. The film’s choice to include original music signals its creators’ understanding of both the story they are writing, as well as their intended audience. These artists are known for their uncanny ability to capture the nostalgic yearning that accompanies a life in suburbia, and these songs prove their continued ability to evoke a similar cinematic response. The songs fit perfectly into the movie, and nothing feels forced.
However, a few directing choices in the movie do seem strangely out of place with the spirit of the film, requiring the audience to suspend its sense of disbelief. For example, Simon’s separate conversations with his parents after coming out seem slightly overdramatized. Additionally, toward the end of the movie, a scene involves an extremely large number of students from the school cheering Simon on as he waits for Blue to reveal himself. In this surreal departure from the rest of the film, the audience must almost completely abandon reality to appreciate the ongoing scene.
Ultimately, however, Love, Simon is an important step forward in LGBTQ visibility for the film industry. Despite embracing a few stereotypical teen romance tropes, the movie effectively mixes LGBTQ themes with an extremely mainstream template. As far as approachability goes, Love, Simon offers something for everyone in the audience, unlike other niche movies that have been released in recent years. The movie is being distributed to many countries that did not show similar films like Moonlight and Call Me by Your Name, making the film somewhat innovative for the film industry, all while being admittedly ordinary. Love, Simon will certainly serve as a beacon of inspiration and relatability to LGBTQ youth around the world.

Rock musician Jack White has released his third solo studio album, Boarding House Reach, nearly four years after his previous solo release Lazaretto. Compared to 2012’s Blunderbuss and Lazaretto, which contained a traditional rock and roll/alternative sound and more twangy production, respectively, Boarding House Reach takes on a fusion of funky-electro and gospel influences. 
Jack White’s third studio album Boarding House Reach is more reflective than his previous work, with tracks that feature spoken word lyrics and a thoughtful, somber tone. Photo courtesy of Third Man Records.
Stylistically, Boarding House Reach is not unlike White’s previous solo albums, but White switches it up by incorporating vocal effects and spoken word tracks. Instead of focusing on an overall upheaval, White chose to make new thematic and lyrical choices on the album, reflecting on his observations of it. Perhaps for White, it’s not so much about changing his sound with each album, but about reflecting on new trials and tribulations in his life.
On almost the entirety of  Boarding House Reach’s 44 minutes and seven seconds, White attempts to impart wisdom on his listeners, and share his existential and philosophical realizations. His messages range from alluding to the Greek myth of Sisyphus and struggles with anxiety on “Over and Over and Over,” to urging listeners not to dress up their pets  on “Why Walk a Dog?” Elsewhere, White observes how people are missing out on experiencing the world due to an obsession with cell phones and technology, a message that shines through  on “Ezmerelda Steals the Show.”   
Even in songs that lack clear philosophical messages, White’s vocal delivery and choice to opt for spoken word poetry instead of traditional rhyme schemes prove that he’s really trying to speak out on this record. He also adopts a somewhat preachy tone throughout the album, with the spoken word style resembling sermons on songs like “Everything You’ve Ever Learned,”  “Abulia and Akrasia” and “Ezmerelda Steals the Show.” 
The songs that stand out the most are “Over and Over and Over,” “Corporation” and “Humoresque.” “Over and Over and Over” is one of the more traditional rock and roll songs of the album, but despite the grittier instrumentation, this track offers probably some of the most personal lyrics of the album. Lyrics like “And I’m punished for the passion / Only telling cause you’re asking” and “I think, therefore I die / Anxiety and I, rolling down a mountain” evidence this sentiment, using poetic devices to connect with the listener. 
“Corporation” is by far the most danceable track on Boarding House Reach. Although the instrumentation is quite catchy, White’s lyrics reveal a sign of the times: “Yeah, I’m thinking about starting a corporation. Who’s with me? Nowadays, that’s how you get adulation.”
The jazzy, piano-backed tune of “Humoresque” stands out from the rest of the album not only instrumentally, but also because it is the only track not written by White on the album. The song actually was written by Chicago mobster Al Capone while he was serving his sentence in Alcatraz, and White anonymously bid on the sheet music to use the music for himself. 
White’s implementation of newer techno sounds and effects on Boarding House Reach has more significance than just trying new things musically, serving as a fitting soundscape for his newer lyrical content. Throughout, he makes a profound statement about society and technology, in relation to his own perception of the world. In some ways, he does it more sneakily (behind catchy guitar riffs) and other times he directly says how he feels (in the mellow instrumentation of the spoken word recordings). But no matter his technique, on Boarding House Reach, White is heard loud and clear.

I have a love-hate relationship with Instagram. Since my series of unfortunate posts circa middle school, I’ve gone through periods of fervent use and periods of disillusionment with the platform. I’ve scrolled and stalked and scoured for hours, my self-worth rising and falling in tandem with the likes my photos garnered. Sometimes, I find Instagram — with its airbrushed web stars and tawdry aesthetics — endlessly demoralizing. Other times, I regard it as a modern haven for artists, curators and aficionados like myself to promote, sell and discover art. 
With its over 800 million users and counting, and as the premiere image-sharing app, it was perhaps inevitable that Instagram would alter the face of the art world. 
Direct sales through Instagram are rivaling private art sales, yet, simultaneously, auction houses and galleries are seeing their sales increase through heightened online engagement. Poets, calligraphers and cartoonists alike have achieved artistic prominence with surges in their comments and followers. Art institutions have even begun actively inviting participation through Instagram hashtags as a means of bolstering ticket sales. The phenomenon has resulted in an explosion of museums and exhibitions specifically designed to be Instagrammable in order to entice crazed crowds and cameras — including the nationally sensational Museum of Ice Cream and Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirrors.
I am personally guilty of staging photoshoots on the sidewalks of the Arts District and against the backdrop of priceless Mike Kelleys. I will even admit that I’ve metroed across Paris on a joint mission for museums and likes. (For evidence, follow me.)
However, the role of Instagram has been hotly contested in the art world in light of several instances where patrons accidentally destroyed art pieces in the process of taking the perfect selfie. Citing copyright considerations as well as the safety of the works, many galleries combat Instagram culture by banning photographic documentation altogether. But prohibiting photography restricts viewers from appreciating art the way they want and remediates a sense of cultural elitism wherein the institution decides that art can only be enjoyed in an orthodox manner. Most egregiously, this overlooks the potential of Instagram to introduce a new facet of artistic appreciation. 
While critics also argue that the culture of Instagram detracts from the art itself and fuels the fire of millennial narcissism, I argue that online sharing adds a new dimension to the experience of art — one that didn’t exist prior to the digital age. It allows viewers to have an active stake in the process of consuming art and recognizing its aesthetic value. It gives visitors greater agency over their experiences and provides an easy forum for museums to strengthen connections with patrons. And once an image has been digitally immortalized, it can be redistributed on a boundless geographic scale — what artist or art-lover would oppose that kind of publicity? 
Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
Sure, when I post a photo with the location tag “Hauser & Wirth Los Angeles” I’m thinking about how I look or what subtle filter to use. But no part of the Instagramming process minimizes my fervor for the art itself or the fact that I want to share it. 
Rather than resist technological changes, museums should embrace the dominance of Instagram culture as a way to disseminate art on a larger and larger scale. They should encourage self-expression on the part of their patrons and devise new ways to integrate social media into the museum-going experience, lest they become an obsolete pastime. 
The extravaganza and media maelstrom surrounding Kusama’s Infinity Mirrors makes her a true artist for the Instagram age because her show was designed to involve the observer in ways other galleries couldn’t: through photography sharing as well as in person. 
For the year or so that it toured the U.S., Kusama’s show became a cultural touchstone — how else would your followers know how voguish you are if you didn’t selfie amid her lights and phalluses?  Instagram cemented the show’s position at the forefront of destination art, generated exponentially growing, free advertising and commodified Kusama’s exhibits as once-in-a-lifetime artistic experiences. It’s difficult to say where she would be if she had banned photography in her exhibitions. But by harnessing the power of Instagram, Kusama became a household name, a true feat for a living contemporary artist.
Great art has always been about spectacle — Instagram is just changing the way we engage with it and, in turn, changing the market of art itself.

On Saturday, USC officially filled a basketball assistant coaching vacancy left by Tony Bland’s firing in January. Head coach Andy Enfield announced the hiring of Eric Mobley on the USC athletics website. Mobley previously coached on the local Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) circuit. 
“We are excited to add Eric to our coaching staff,” Enfield said in an official statement. “He brings to our program a wealth of playing and coaching experience at a variety of levels. He is an outstanding coach and a terrific person.” 
Mobley will replace Bland, who was arrested by the FBI on charges of bribery in September 2017. Mobley’s hire, however, did not come without its fair share of controversy. His two sons, Isaiah and Evan, are both high-profile recruits at Rancho Christian High School in Temecula, Calif. 247Sports lists Isaiah as a four-star prospect and Evan as a five-star. Many on social media regard the hire as a way to ensure both sons end up playing for USC.
The hire mirrors Missouri’s decision to bring on Michael Porter Sr. as an assistant coach before the 2017 season, and subsequently sign his son, five-star recruit Michael Porter Jr. Porter Jr. declared for the NBA Draft on Monday. 
This past season, Mobley coached Evan on the Compton Magic AAU 16U team, while Isaiah competed on the U17 team. According to USC, Mobley has coached AAU programs for over a decade. 
In Bland’s absence, Director of Scouting Martin Bahar served as interim assistant coach for the entirety of the 2017-18 season. Bahar will return to his previous role next season.

The USC football team continues to have physical practices as their Spring game on April 14 draws closer. On Tuesday, the Trojans dealt with lingering injuries while the ongoing quarterback competition intensified.
Injuries
Redshirt freshman defensive lineman Marlon Tuipulotu continued to work separately from the team as he recovers from a back injury from last season. 
Sophomore running back Vavae Malepeai took 1st and 2nd team reps in his return from a short absence. Meanwhile, junior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr., who is currently dealing with an AC sprain in his shoulder, was a limited participant. He was involved in positional drills that included route running, but did not have pads on and did not play in the scrimmages.

Quarterback Battle
Both quarterbacks had their highs and lows in practice. Redshirt freshman Jack Sears and redshirt sophomore Matt Fink showed athleticism in their ability to maneuver around the pocket but also missed some key throws to their receivers.
Quarterbacks coach Bryan Ellis stressed that while they are keeping many of the concepts they employed with former quarterback Sam Darnold, he does not want Sears and Fink to mimic everything from their predecessor.
“We want them to see and keep learning those concepts we’ve used but I don’t want them to watch Sam because Sam was his own different animal,” Ellis said. “They need to be the players that they are.”
Standouts
With now NFL-bound wide receiver Deontay Burnett’s departure and the Pittman Jr. injury, sophomore Josh Imatorbhebhe has been one of the bright spots for a suddenly thin wide receiving core. Running with the first and second-string offense, Imatorbhebhe showed explosion after a short catch and run as well as deep-threat ability, connecting with redshirt sophomore Holden Thomas on a deep ball down the right sideline. 
While head coach Clay Helton previously attached Imatorbhebhe’s success to a better understanding of the playbook, the former ESPN 300 recruit attributed his progression to an improved focus. 
“If I have to run a route, I’m making sure my pad level is low,” Imatorbhebhe said. “I’m getting out of my breaks quickly, and I’m not letting it get into my head if I drop a ball.”
His quarterbacks have taken notice of his progress. 
“[Imatorbhebhe] is a great athlete, and I can’t wait to see him on the field more,” Fink said.
On the defensive side of the ball, the senior duo of linebackers Porter Gustin and Cameron Smith stood out again as leaders both vocally and through their play. The duo basically lived in the backfield, and Gustin sacked redshirt freshman quarterback Jack Sears on back-to-back plays while Smith, playing in the “Mike” linebacker position once again in defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s system, called out defenses along with his solid play. 
Offensive Line
After finishing last season 71st in the country in sacks allowed with 30, both offensive line coach Neil Callaway and his players focused on one theme: toughness. 
Sophomore Andrew Vorhees, who started the final nine games at right guard last year, highlighted this, saying, “Our team, and my unit specifically, need to be tougher mentally and physically this year.” 
 The specific game that continues to haunt some of the Trojans and the offensive line in particular, is the Cotton Bowl, where USC allowed a season-high eight sacks. 
“[Ohio State was] the best defensive line we played all year and the game was an experience we need to learn from,” said sophomore Austin Jackson, a potential starting offensive tackle who appeared in all 14 games last season. 
With projected starting center senior Toa Lobendahn limited in spring practice, redshirt freshman Brett Neilon and freshman early enrollee Justin Dedich have earned high praise from both Callaway and Helton. Callaway mentioned their “punch and quickness of the line of scrimmage” and Helton praised their ability to “avoid assignment errors and not getting physically beaten.”
Entering next season, the USC coaching staff has the tough task of replacing seniors guard Viane Talamauvao and center Nico Falah on the offensive line. However, the unit returns three starters from last year, along with frequent contributors such as Jackson and redshirt junior offensive tackle Clayton Johnston.
Both are projected to take on starting roles in the fall.

After a hot first inning for the Trojans, the team managed to hold off the Cal State Fullerton Titans by a score of 3-1 to earn a win.

The Trojans entered the game with a four-game losing streak following losses to UC Irvine and Stanford. The Trojans struggled mightily in their series against Stanford scoring only 2 runs while giving up 34 in the process. Meanwhile, the Titans came into the game losing twice in their three game series against Long Beach State. 
The Trojans got off to a hot start, scoring three runs in the first inning. Junior first baseman Dylan Paulson hit a double into center field driving in 2 runs. Redshirt junior designated hitter Stephen Dubb continued the scoring in the first inning, hitting a single to left field driving in a run. In total, the Trojan bats were on fire in the first inning as they scored 3 runs on five hits.
On the mound, sophomore pitcher Austin Manning started his first game of the year. Before taking on the Titans, Manning had seven appearances during the season, however, all of them came in relief. Manning looked to be in complete control in the first inning as he retired the first three batters in the inning.
During the second inning, the Titans were able to get a hit off Manning, but left that runner in scoring position as they were also unable to put any runs on the board.
The third inning was much like the second for both teams. Sophomore center fielder Matthew Acosta managed to single for the Trojans, but the Trojans were unable to score Acosta. On the other end, while the Titans were able to get on base after Manning hit junior outfielder Mitchell Berryhill, they were unable to score any runs as the Trojans ended the inning with a double play.
Good fielding has been a trend for the Trojans all season long. The Trojans currently have the best fielding percentage in the country, making only 10 errors all season, according to NCAA statistics.
However, the Titans followed that double play with one of their own after sophomore right fielder Christian Moya hit a fly ball into right field and redshirt junior third baseman Angelo Armenta got thrown out at first as he was trying to run the bases. The Titans then managed to put one run on the board in the fourth inning as sophomore catcher Daniel Cope hit a sacrifice fly to score junior outfielder Ruben Cardenas who was already on third.
Manning allowed just one hit in the fifth inning in what would be his last inning on the mound, before being taken out in the sixth. He finished the game with five innings pitched, four strikeouts, four hits and no walks in his first start of the season.
In the sixth, Dubb singled up the middle and then advanced to second following a balk. However, he was left on second base as the Trojans were once again unable to send a runner home from scoring position. Junior pitcher Solomon Bates took the mound for the Trojans in the sixth inning. Going into the game, Bates had a 3.94 ERA on seven appearances on the season. Bates allowed just one hit in the sixth inning and kept the score at 3-1 heading into the seventh.
During the ninth inning, the Trojans managed to load the bases with Perez up to bat. However, he hit a hard grounder to short, which was fielded perfectly and prevented the Trojans from scoring any more runs. Sophomore closer Connor Lunn then went into the game for the Trojans and was able to see off the game for his seventh save on the year. Manning also took home his first win for the year.
After today’s game, the Trojans set their record at 12-9. The Trojans will look to extend their winning streak as they face off against Washington on Thursday night at Dedeaux Field.

Trevor Denton | Daily Trojan
A year ago, the hapless Rams finished 4-12 in their first season back in Los Angeles. 
Worse than their record, the team was downright dreadful to watch. Under then-head coach Jeff Fisher, rookie quarterback Jared Goff threw more interceptions than touchdowns, while running back Todd Gurley was limited to a dismal 3.2 yards per carry, after ripping through the league as a rookie in 2015. 
The offense possessed plenty of talent, but the coaching staff had no idea how to use it. It was more frustrating than watching your grandparents try to use an iPad. 
But sometimes a coaching change can make all the difference. Before this season, 31-year-old Sean McVay was hired to re-energize the Rams’ dormant offense, and he somehow accomplished much more. The Rams led the league in scoring in 2017 (29.9 points per game), after finishing last in that category in 2016. Gurley ended his sophomore slump with a 2,093 total yard, MVP-worthy campaign, while Goff looked like a potential franchise quarterback. 
The Rams made leaps and bounds in 2017, but they’ve managed to get even better this off-season. After acquiring elite defensive backs Marcus Peters and Aquib Talib a couple of weeks ago, Los Angeles inked All-Pro defensive tackle Ndamakung Suh to a one-year, $14 million deal on Monday. 
Under venerated coordinator Wade Phillips, the Rams’ defense was already among the league’s best. Now it’s downright terrifying for opposing offenses. With Suh, Talib and Peters, the team has an elite defense to complement its historically prolific offense. 
Phillips will be able to place line up Suh alongside reigning Defensive Player of the Year Aaron Donald, creating one of the best defensive fronts in history (at least in theory). Suh and Donald have similar skill sets — they can both stuff the run and also terrorize passers from the interior (the duo would have combined for 15.5 sacks in 2017), and both still have plenty of gas in the tank (Suh is 31, Donald is a spry 26). Being able to field both future Hall of Famers in the prime of their careers is borderline unfair. 
One of Suh’s major considerations when choosing a team in free agency, was going somewhere he could avoid being double-teamed every play. Therefore, it makes sense why he took a pay cut to join the Rams. By playing next to a fellow human wrecking crew in Donald, Suh will have a better chance of avoiding L.A. traffic than ever seeing a double-team from an opposing offensive line (NFC West quarterbacks Jimmy Garapolo’s and Russell Wilson’s lives just got a lot more complicated).

The Suh signing will understandably draw the most attention, but don’t underestimate the impact of Talib and Peters. Los Angeles fielded a middle of the pack secondary in 2017, giving up 217.2 yards per game through the air (12th in the league) and 54 completions over 20 yards (seventh most in the league). Their best defensive back Trumaine Johnson was set to become a free agent this offseason. Instead of resigning Johnson to a mega-deal, they let him walk and still managed to upgrade their secondary in stunning fashion. 
Talib is a 10-year veteran with five-straight Pro Bowl appearances, while Peters brings unmatched ball-hawking, upside at the position. He’s snagged an incredible 19 interceptions since joining the league in 2015, to go along with six forced fumbles and five recoveries. With Talib’s experience, you know exactly what you’re getting — with Peters, 25, the sky is the limit. 
The Rams are already having the best off-season of any team, but they may not even be finished just yet. Reports indicate L.A. could be in the runningmix to acquire Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., one of the best young players in the league. If that trade does indeed happen, all bets are off. The Rams would be fielding one of the most talented teams in league history, a year removed from finishing 11-5 and winning the NFC West by a wide margin. 
On paper, the team will be stacked with or without Beckham Jr. The only major question will be if McVay can handle so many polarizing personalities on one roster. Talib, Peters, Suh and Beckham Jr. (if they land him) are all controversial figures for different reasons. Having all four in the same locker room could be magical or destructive — just don’t expect much of a middle ground. 
Either way, the Rams enter the 2018 season as one of the most talented and exciting teams in recent memory. Not bad for a franchise that terribly fumbled its debut season in Los Angeles just two years ago.

A step into the underground level of Doheny Memorial Library transports visitors to a version of Lewis Carroll’s Wonderland in an art gallery that pays homage to the author’s writing and spirit. 
The underground level of Doheny Memorial Library is home to an art gallery about Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll. Tyson Gaskill | Daily Trojan
In 2000, USC alumnus George Cassady and his wife Linda Cassady donated 110 books related to the life and works of Lewis Carroll to USC libraries, the author best-known for his works Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. The Cassadys wanted students to be aware of the donated items and be able to use and study the collection. 
“We wanted to ensure that students knew about and used the collection … that it would be a collection that is alive and world-class … so we needed to grow that collection,” Linda Cassady said. 
To expand upon the existing collection, the Cassadys collaborated with USC Libraries to launch the annual Wonderland Awards in 2005. According to USC Libraries, the awards competition “encourages new scholarship and creative work related to [Carroll].”
Tyson Gaskill, the executive director of communications and events for USC Libraries, emphasized that the competition serves to spur interest in Carroll’s contributions to modern literature and pop culture. 
“I can’t even imagine how many results you would get from just typing in ‘down the rabbit hole’ — that phrase alone just seems to pop up everyday, everywhere you go,” Gaskill said. 
Gaskill said that though Carroll is mainly known for his contributions to fiction, he was also a polymath who exhibited his talents in diverse fields. On top of teaching mathematics at Oxford University, Carroll produced logical games, word puzzles and portrait photography.
Thus, the competition was also established as a multidisciplinary incentive for students to set fields they would not otherwise explore. 
“People’s imagination[s] [are] really broad,” Linda Cassady said. “They have had an opportunity to do what they would not normally do. A mathematician does art, a molecular biologist does puzzle games … Students also get to appreciate the work that other people do at the gallery.”
According to Linda Cassady, throughout the past 14 years, submissions have become increasingly radical and technological in nature. 
“The change has been that some of the pieces have gotten much more electronic,” Linda Cassady said. “So we have more incredibly detailed animation. We also have more teamwork, because when you are doing an animation, you need a writer, artist, programmer, etc.”
For example, last year’s first prize winners were USC students majoring in interactive media: Yiwen Dai, Kelsey Rice and Jung-Ho Sohn. The team wanted to introduce a distinctive project that utilized interactive media to the collection, which led them to experiment with augmented reality. 
Instead of a technological demonstration, the group wanted to create an interactive game piece based on coming of age as the main theme. 
“We wanted the piece to be technology that people can experience,” Dai said. “The core mechanic of this experience is that we are trying to create a simulation of growing up and reflecting on previous experiences.”
Linda Cassady said the artistic statement is crucial to convey the participant’s creative process and inspiration taken from Carroll’s collection. A well-crafted artistic statement bolsters the project’s complexity and helps the judges understand the entrants’ unique interpretations, she said. 
“[The Artistic statements] helps us understand what the person submitting the piece is moved by,” Linda Cassady said. “Sometimes it is quite ingenious … sometimes it is part of the discovery … The piece becomes much more complex and Carrollian as we see the hidden meaning in that work.”
According to Gaskill, the Wonderland competition has continued to expand, as submissions have increased in both volume and quality.
“Students are seeing what’s happened before and they are saying, ‘That is a really good idea. Now how about I take it to the next level?’” Gaskill said. “So they are being influenced by past competition submissions and taking them to new directions.”

Undergraduate Student Government President Austin Dunn addressed the USG Senate in his State of USG speech Tuesday. He spoke about the progress made by USG this year across all branches and how the organization has worked toward enhancing transparency, student wellness and diversity.

He noted the fall break resolution and dining hall take-out resolution passed by the senate as instances of USG working to improve health and wellness on campus. He also said that the Thirty-Second Thursday segments posted on USG’s Facebook page to inform students are an example of USG reaching out to the community.
The senate also passed a bylaw amendment proposed by Senator Katie Bolton and Co-Director of Service Student Assembly Alec Vandenberg which adds a new director of external affairs position to the advocacy branch of USG by a vote of 10-1. The position would promote political awareness and involvement among undergraduate students. A similar bylaw amendment was rejected by the senate six weeks ago due to concerns over partisan leanings potentially influencing the position.
The version that the senate passed Tuesday explicitly dealt with the issue of partisan bias. 
“The external affairs director shall strive to remove barriers to student political participation, absent any influence of personal political views,” the resolution stated. 
Senate aide Neal Sivadas, Parliamentarian Julianna Hrovat and Senators Joey Hall and Isabella Smith proposed a resolution to form a committee to examine how the transitional experiences of spring admits can be enhanced. Hall explained that the resolution is meant to comprehensively address broad issues for spring-admitted students at USC.
“This is a resolution regarding my consolidation of projects I have been working on for the spring-admit experience for the entire year,” Hall said. “It addresses things like housing, welcome week, orientation and advisement for all spring-admitted students.”
Hall read the resolution, which explains the composition and broad intentions of the task force, aloud.
“The Undergraduate Student Government of the University of Southern California does hereby resolve that a committee be formed consisting of both administration and spring-admitted students currently attending USC,” Hall read from the resolution, “… to create equal opportunity among all first-year students, regardless of admission date, specifically tailored to orientation, welcome week, housing, registration, and advisement.”
Hrovat cited various surveys conducted by USG which indicate that spring-admitted students, by in large, are unsatisfied not only with programs such as Welcome Week, but also with their broader experiences in making friends and integrating into the community. 
“97.1 percent of (spring-admitted) students attended an orientation session and only 27.5 (percent) of those students responded ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ to the statement, ‘I had enough time to familiarize myself with USC during orientation,’” Hrovat said.

With over 40 events this academic year, the USC chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers has made its mark helping to support Black students majoring in STEM fields at USC.

And that work was recognized on a national level — the USC chapter was named Best Medium Chapter of the Year at the National Society of Black Engineers Annual Convention in Pittsburgh last week. 
The USC chapter had also won Best Large Chapter of the Year in 2015, before they were redesignated to the Medium size category due to NSBE rule changes, according to USC NSBE Vice President Ellah Ipah. 
“Our chapter prides [itself] on making sure that we are putting on the best programming, that our programming is diverse, and we challenge ourselves to do that,” Ipah said. “For example, we put on our first Black Excellence Gala [this year] … We were able to get it sponsored by Google, and that was a really big deal because it was the first time that we had done anything of this nature and it had gotten a lot of attention from some of our vice deans and Dean within [Viterbi].”
Ipah credits the executive board and USC with helping the chapter reach its success.
“I think that our e-board is exceptional and they work very hard,” Ipah said. “USC has instilled that within us: to put our best foot forward always. And that shows in our programming and the leadership we have in our organization.”
To win the award, the chapter submitted documentation of the over 40 events it organized throughout the year in categories like inclusion and academic excellence, Ipah said. The chapter was also considered based on its participation in the national convention. With 30 USC attendees, they were one of the largest chapters in attendance, according to Ipah.
Ipah said that winning the award proves that USC NSBE is doing important work. 
“We spent all year really pushing people to come to [the convention] or join NSBE,” she said. “It can be a challenge sometimes to see value in that when we’ve got so many things going on … But when you’re able to put that magnitude behind the name, [and prove that] we’re putting on good programming, we’re a substantial force within our community, within our organization on a national level, it definitely encourages people to come and take us more seriously.”

Students gathered at Bovard Auditorium Tuesday to see members from rock band Young the Giant speak about their most recent album, Home of the Strange, as well as their opinions on current immigration issues.

The talk was organized by USC Speakers Committee, USC Service Student Assembly, USC International Student Assembly and USC Political Student Assembly. The event featured lead vocalist Sameer Gadhia, guitarist Jacob Tilley and bass guitarist Payam Doostzadeh of Young the Giant, and was moderated by USC Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni. 
Soni began the event by discussing current social issues, particularly racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and transphobia, which have been “grappled with very publicly over the last two years.”
“From the persecution [of] undocumented immigrants and refugees to the increase in civil rights challenges for LGBTQ … it has been a very challenging time for all of us who aspire to live up to our ideals of diversity, inclusion, equity and justice,” Soni said.
As the Dean of Religious Life, Soni said he has witnessed the impact these political issues have had on campus. According to Soni, government decisions have caused DACA students and staff to worry about their futures, and international students have been affected by the travel bans.
“We need musicians … who are politically engaged, spiritually astute, socially active,” Soni said. “Musicians who are voices for peace, reconciliation and justice … So we are very fortunate to spend this evening with Young the Giant.” 
During the event, Young the Giant members discussed their 2016 song “Amerika.” Unlike previous songs, “Amerika” delves into political issues and addresses themes like displacement. Band members discussed this shift in terms of the types of music the group has produced over time.
“We’ve been doing this for almost 10 years now, which is crazy,” Gadhia said. “And the first two albums, we were trying to establish ourselves. For this third record, we wanted to show a little more of who we were and pay homage to our parents because we wouldn’t have been here without them.” 
According to Gadhia, the group noticed the “undercurrent” of anger and division throughout the nation, which continued to grow following the 2016 presidential election. Gadhia said the group became more exposed to these social issues, and by creating music that touches on these topics, they hope to generate more conversation.
“I don’t necessarily think we are a political band,” Gadhia said. “I think all art, even if it’s not conscious, can give a political or social snapshot of that time. So this record for us I guess it could be considered as a political record, but in a lot of ways we’re just talking about what we want to talk about.” 
Doostzadeh said that “Amerika” was inspired by Franz Kafka’s incomplete first novel, regarding the current discussion on immigration. According to Doostzadeh, the novel is about a German child who sneaks into America to pursue the American Dream. 
“And every time he feels like he’s feeling comfortable, there is this strange feeling where everything also feels like it’s falling beneath him,” Doostzadeh said. “[It’s this] idea of the ‘in between,’ the place that doesn’t exist between where your family came from, where you might have come from, where you are now and the different cultural expectations and ideas of the American Dream.” 
Tilley ended the conversation with closing remarks about how he ultimately finds the motivation to pursue his passions and his aspirations for the band.
“We’re striving to be the band that we can be,” Tilley said. “We want to find passion projects and I think all of us are trying to find what the next 10 years look like in our careers and personal lives. What gives me hope is you guys. Sometimes I struggle to find it from within, but I just see you guys to find motivation.”
