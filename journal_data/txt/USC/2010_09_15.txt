Many critics have hailed Catfish, the reality thriller from Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, as a product of our time — a Hitchcockian tale that couldn’t exist without the Internet, social networks or the ability to dump digital videos onto hard drives until space runs out. Although that’s true, our time might be what eventually undoes Catfish as well.
As a clarification, the film has nothing to do with fish. At least not in the literal sense.
Candid camera · The film creates a story comprised of documentary-style footage, in the vein of films such as The Fourth Kind and Paranormal Activity, with likeable characters and a romantic storyline. - Photos courtesy of Rogue
In 2007, photographer Nev Schulman — co-director Ariel Schulman’s brother — received a painting of one of his pictures from an 8-year-old named Abby. Over the next few months, they become e-pen pals. He sent pictures and she sent her art which for an 8-year-old’s work is stunning. Through Facebook, he connects with her parents, brother and  older sister Megan. Then, things get interesting.
The relationship that develops between Megan and Nev is decidedly more adult. They speak for hours at a time over the phone and also exchange art. Megan paints pictures of Nev, which she says she rests on her chest while sleeping; Nev Photoshops Megan into a picture of himself naked from the waist up. They do lots of sexting. They’re in love.
Then one night while on a filmmaking trip to Vail, Colo., Joost and the Schulmans catch Megan in a lie. They travel to Michigan to meet her and discover —
Going on would spoil the movie.
The genius in Catfish lies in the psychological depths that the third act explores and even more so, how cleverly that third act unfolds. Schulman and Joost play on  the expectations the audience brings to the theater — preconceived notions of the perils of online dating and what happens in the dark during reality thrillers filmed on grainy hand-held cameras. Even as Mark Mothersbaugh’s plucky score bounces along, audience members sits perched on the edge of their seat.
Hitchcock would be proud.
But those audience expectations could be Catfish’s biggest obstacle. Walking out of the theater, the debate centers on one thing: Is it real?
The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity and The Fourth Kind share the blame. They were all  documentary-style horrors that purported themselves to be true. In the end, they weren’t, and the audience will suspect the same of Catfish.
If it’s a hoax, then Joost and the Schulmans are master magicians. They’re careful to show typos as Nev chats with Megan, or technical glitches, like when Ariel accidentally takes a still photo with his video camera during a crucial scene. More impressive, they balance the inherent humor of three guys working together and make the film as funny and lighthearted as it is suspenseful.
If it’s a hoax, Nev Schulman deserves an Oscar for bringing an endearing, honest character to life so successfully that it’s difficult to detect an ounce of affectation. He’s the perfect romantic hero for the film: handsome, good-natured and silly. In one scene, Nev forgets the camera’s presence and talks with his hand shoved down the front of his pants. In another, he wears his retainer while reading aloud a sexually explicit exchange of text messages before covering his head with his blanket, his voice cracking with embarrassment.
If it’s a hoax, these guys are better than anyone who’s come before them.
But if it’s not, then the three have managed to capture a moment between two people that starts fun and romantic and unexpectedly becomes sad and startling. Though its methodology is undeniably a product of our times, the mystery of Catfish and the revelation at the end is a timeless one.
The ultimate lesson of Catfish is that people occasionally come along and keep us on our toes. They make life more interesting, and make us better people for it. Wrapped into that is the grade-school lesson of “Don’t judge a book by it’s cover.”
To fully appreciate Catfish, don’t judge it by its predecessors. True or false, it’s a moving story and fantastically told.

Listeners will make a mistake if they experience this concept album in any other way than as one whole piece. These songs are not stand-alones; they are part of a story, one that is as dazzling as it is complex. Every single sound, every moment of silence, every interlude, every speech that Linkin Park chose to include in the record has a purpose. In fact, the only real way to listen to this record for the first time is in the utmost seclusion with headphones on full blast.
Newest creation · The recent release presents a detailed story about a nuclear war with tracks that also include brief audio excerpts. - Photo courtesy of Warner Brothers  
Even then, it is impossible to catch every masterful decision Linkin Park makes, which listeners will discover more and more with each play.
The record comes together so superbly that referring to it as a CD does it inadequate justice: It is a work of art. If you close your eyes for the duration of the record, the music will create an atmosphere that will give you chills.
A Thousand Suns is not meant to be played as background music. It deserves listeners’ full attention, and if they can make that commitment, the results will truly be worthwhile. Just one track in particular cannot be discussed for this reason — A Thousand Suns should not be torn apart in that manner, and it would be best if listeners had nothing spoiled for them so they can experience the album in the purest way possible.
A nuclear war is the backdrop to the record’s storyline, and it consequently deals with the destruction, fear, greed and changing relationships that such devastation could cause. The plot commences with a voiceover quoting a passage from the Bhagavad Gita — which is where the album’s title comes from — before the lyrical narrative begins to describe how the deaths of innocent people lead to war. It then turns to a challenge made by a character in the story to the opposing side, declaring that he is ready to face all challengers if they can keep up with him.
It is this moment where the record takes on an apocalyptic theme; and listeners can sense the anarchy in the music and lyrics.
Contrary to the anarchy, however, is the idea that compassion is necessary in life, which lead singer Chester Bennington communicates through his soulful vocals.
This feeling lingers as the subject then turns to refusing to let go of hope and resolving to never give up, even in the face of the nuclear holocaust. Of course, it is not easy to remain so calm in times of tragedy, as Bennington’s character verbally attacks another person for giving up and doing nothing to try to help the situation.
The plot changes to narrate a power struggle and how it is a scramble among the “wretches and kings” to see who will come out on top.
Following this event, a beautiful piano melody backs up a Martin Luther King Jr. speech about “wisdom, justice and love,” which is sure to send a chill down the listener’s spine. The record’s final messages deal with the tranquility immediately following the nuclear storm, seeking forgiveness for the actions taken and ultimately proclaiming life leaves us blind /  but love keeps us kind.
As for the music and lyrics, they are absolutely top-notch. Linkin Park clearly challenged itself in the making of this record and its effort pays off tremendously. Not only is the album extremely impressive, it is also quite brave because it goes against the usual formula for success. It features songs united and enhanced by each other as opposed to being separate tracks that fit right in on radio rotations.
Linkin Park is not the band it was in 2000 when its debut Hybrid Theory was released. In fact, it is not even the band it was in 2007 when Minutes to Midnight shocked longtime fans with genre change. With A Thousand Suns, Linkin Park creates its own genre that infuses reggae, pop, electronica, rap, hip-hop and alternative rock into a magnificently coherent piece.
Mike Shinoda (who also plays keyboards) has never spouted out better lyrics in his raps, and Chester Bennington proves he is one of the industry’s finest vocalists. The rest of the band Brad Delson (guitar), Dave “Phoenix” Farrell (bass), Rob Bourdon (drums) and Joe Hahn  (turntables/programming) has never sounded tighter.
Not everyone will like this record. If people allow 48 minutes of their time to listen to it in the proper fashion, however, they will at least be able to commend Linkin Park for a job well done. A Thousand Suns has broken all boundaries and in doing so has provided one of the most ambitious and enjoyable listening experiences in today’s music world.

There’s nothing like the written word. It pervades the back covers of novels, the glaring lights of electric billboards and the glossy fronts on magazines. Yet in an increasingly media-centered world, this love of reading and the written word is threatened.
But with the arrival of the Kindle, Nook and other electronic reading devices as well as upcoming film adaptations of novels, perhaps the written word will experience a revival.
Here to add to the preservation of this medium is the three-day event Festival de Flor Y Canto: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow, a meeting of Chicano and Latino writers and poets that opened Wednesday on the second floor of Doheny Library.
Organized by Tyson Gaskill and Barbara Robinson from USC Libraries and Maria-Elena Martínez from the history department, the Visions and Voices event is co-sponsored by USC’s El Centro Chicano and the Latino Student Assembly. Not only a celebration of appreciation toward the complex and mesmerizing craft of poetry, the festival also focuses on Chicano and Latino culture in the hopes of sharing it with the rest of campus.
With an eclectic mix of poets all under the same roof, the program is flooded with talent and pieces which will broaden the horizons of poetry fans and the rest of the student body alike.
The event started in 1973, when the first festival graced the USC campus and current festival organizer Michael Sedano worked as a photographer for the Daily Trojan. In the midst of writing a dissertation of Chicano and Latino literature, Sedano heard of the event, which piqued his interest and led him to attend — with camera in hand.
“I gave myself the job of documenting the festival … and then I went to work in private industry for 24 years and all that time those images were in my mind,” Sedano said.
Keeping the images from the 1973 festival in mind, Sedano decided to bring Flor Y Canto back to USC. Sedano said he was inspired to recreate the festival at USC to give current students the opportunity to see work from authors who attended the original festival more than three decades ago.
“Now is the right time to hold this festival because the original performers are getting advanced in age … they’re going to disappear soon,” Sedano said.
A large focus of Flor Y Canto is bridging the gap between this generation and the classic authors, Sedano said. The event will include a section for students to recite their works on Friday — an opportunity for unknown poets and authors to showcase their work alongside literature icons.
But the event does not limit itself to written works. Before putting the festival into motion, Sedano became interested in retrieving the video recordings of the 1973 festival. After a search through various universities for the recordings and dealing with copyright issues, Sedano finally acquired the footage, which will be included in a Doheny Library collection for the public to watch.
“They’re permanent, just like my photos,” Sedano said.
The central goal of the three-day festival is to ensure the lasting influence of writing — specifically Chicano and Latino literature, Sedano said.
“If people will come and share the poems that are being read this Thursday and Friday by contemporary young poets, they will see that the same aesthetics that motivate any writer or reader are present in Chicano and Latino literature,” Sedano said.
The event includes performances on Thursday by Danny Romero, Gloria E. Alvarez, Francisco Alarcón and Olga Garcia. Friday will mark the end of the event with visits from Ruben R. Mendoza, Karen Cordova, Sarah R. Garcia and John-Michael Rivera. The event also features an exhibition entitled Sueños by the Sea: Celebrating Los Festivales de Flor y Canto at USC, which features Sedano’s photographs from the original festival. The public can view this exhibit until Dec. 15.

Once a Blackberry user, I converted to the iPhone last spring and haven’t regretted it. The Internet is easier to use, the screen is larger and it automatically syncs with my iTunes, iCalendar, iPhoto and address book on my MacBook. My favorite feature of the iPhone, however, is the applications. The Pew Internet Project released a new study that found 24 percent of adults use mobile applications. Here are a few my favorite free applications:
Facebook
The Facebook mobile application enables users to be active and in touch with Facebook activity when away from their computers. My favorite feature of the application is the personalized push notifications, or text messages, that let you know when someone has written on your wall, tagged you in a photo or made a comment.
This way, cellphone users don’t waste their time or battery checking for updates. Images and videos take more time to load on the mobile application. It is easy, however, to update your status, search friends and read the newsfeed on the homepage of the application. “Places” is the newest feature of the mobile application; it allows you to check in wherever you are located and then tag friends who are with you.
Twitter
The mobile application for Twitter gives people the ability to instantly tweet their status, news and pictures from wherever they are located. The mobile application allows users access to all Twitter’s functions, including retweeting, searching, mentioning, etc. It is designed, however, for you to update your own live status. Live-tweeting enhances Twitter’s organic user base and adds to its credibility as a real-time resource.
Foursquare
Foursquare has a website; however, it can only be used to sign up for the mobile application. The location-based service is designed solely to be a mobile application. The first page of the application prompts you to check in at your current location by listing venues near you. When you check in, you can see who else is there, who the mayor — the person who has checked in to a location the most — is and if there are any tips for that venue including menu critiques, discounts, etc. When you check in, you have the option of sharing your location with your friends on Foursquare, Twitter and Facebook.
Project 365
This application is designed to help you make each day memorable by taking one photograph for every day of the year. The application is simply a blank calendar, and by selecting whatever day it is, you are transferred to the camera feature where you can take a picture, comment and upload it as the photo for that day.
Pandora
It’s personalized radio anytime, anywhere and it could not be more genius. It allows you to create new stations, change stations and like songs. A song, artist or album can be the basis of a station, which will play similar music.
The New York Times
I used to receive The New York Times general headline updates via e-mail, but the mobile application is much better because it allows me to personalize the content, save stories on the application and read full articles. It also allows you to receive text message notifications for alerts and stories. For people who normally read the news every day, using this application is a natural transition. For people who don’t read the news every day, however, making it a daily routine can be a challenge. Most news organizations have mobile applications, so download the one you know you’ll actively use.
iMapMyRun
I use this application every time I go running. It times you, uses GPS to track and record the distance you run, gives you your average speed, allows you to create new routes and saves your workouts so that you can review your fitness progress.
Yelp
The Yelp mobile application is a personalized, location-based database that helps you find stores and restaurants and read reviews. You can search for a specific business location,  find the closest and get directions. You can also search for a keyword, such as “grocery,” to find the nearest grocery stores or “Thai food,” to find the nearest Thai restaurants.
Most of these applications are available for all smartphones.

Some USC students are taking part in a long, ongoing effort in Los Angeles — making the city greener.
School of Architecture students will place a rolling grass hill installation next to Watt Hall tomorrow to take part in the fourth annual Park[ing] Day LA, a one-day event where parking spots are transformed into temporary green parks across Los Angeles.
Enoch Chow, coordinator of the Architecture Student Council, leads 16 architecture students who helped coordinate Park[ing] Day LA’s efforts at USC. This is the third year USC students participated in the event, two years of which Chow directed.
 Day LA. – James Watson | Daily Trojan “]There will be a large-scale grass hill installation for sitting and lounging on parking spot 15 next to the Watt Hall. The installation represents a “symbolic message for sustainability by taking over the public sphere,” Chow said.
The fourth-annual Park[ing] Day LA will have students, artists and community volunteers occupying metered parking spaces on the streets and transforming them into pocket-parks at more than 25 locations across Los Angeles.
Chow said he wanted to give  undergraduate students a taste of what it is like to work in a design firm. Chow decided to divide the 16-person staff into three teams for design, management and construction. It is also the first time students from all years are participating in coordinating the installation, rather than only senior and grad students.
“Don’t be passive,” Chow said. “I want young students to take the initiative with projects outside the curriculum.”
Chow said he saw seniors with more experience collaborate with younger undergraduates to share advice and ideas on engineering, budgeting and time management during the coordination of this project.
“I would like to pass it on and make it a traditional legacy for architecture students,” Chow said. “I know that I can be there for the younger students.”
The older architecture majors were able to provide technical advice and mentorship to younger students of the same major, Chow said.
The event will be held from noon to 4 p.m. Volunteers will come together to embrace the slogan “parks, not parking.” In the previous PDLA event, residents transformed asphalt parking spaces into grass patches, vegetable stands, small gardens and beach chairs.
USC urban planning students, along with community groups, architectural firms, churches and neighborhood councils, will host parking spots throughout the day and transform the urban concrete landscape. The event is meant to spark interaction among students, designers, companies and city governments about the way streets currently are used, according the PDLA website.
Last year, merchants and LA residents occupied the streets with picket fences, bookshelves, speakers, fans and even Wi-Fi portals, he added.
David Lai, a freshman majoring in architecture, heard about the Park[ing] Day LA event from his friends in the School of Architecture.
“Seeing green spots in L.A. that are normally concrete really visually inspires us design students,” Lai said. He also said he is trying to get a few more students to join him in the event.
The organizers of the PDLA event were inspired by the Rebar group in San Francisco, which transformed metered parking spots into small parks to make a public comment on the lack of quality open space in U.S. cities, according to the PDLA website. A similar festival is held in Miami.

Psychologists from USC, the University of Texas at Austin and Beijing Normal University recently have found that some of our understanding of memory retention is incorrect.
In a study published online on Sept. 9 in Science, researchers at these schools discovered that memory increases when similar patterns are repeated for strength rather than when multiple varying patterns are made.
The long-standing belief held by psychologists maintains that information is best remembered when attained or learned in varying contexts, which creates multiple patterns to remember the information.
Gui Xue, a research assistant  and professor of psychology at USC who worked on the project, said that while someone is studying an item, he or she has to process or re-activate the same pattern repeatedly in order to be able to better remember the information.
“If you create one pattern during the first learning and a different pattern during the second learning, you are going to remember worse,” Xue said.
Experiments were conducted using functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, which allowed the researchers to monitor the memory patterns used for recollection.
Subjects were given materials such as words, faces and novel texts and were asked to recall material at a later time.
“When the activation pattern is more consistent across repetitions, you are going to remember better,” Xue said.
The research is aimed at developing additional understanding of the “forgetting curve.”
This concept, developed by Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885, holds that memory decreases exponentially with time. The strength of one’s memory is determined by how long memory traces sustain.
Although this type of research does occur often, the researchers “developed new ideas — pattern similarity — and analysis techniques,” says study co-author Zhong-Lin Lu of USC, who holds the William M. Keck chair in cognitive neuroscience and is a professor of psychology and biomedical engineering.
As the research continues, Lu said the group is working toward a larger objective.
“One aim of our research is to find neural signatures that would allow us to predict whether and when people will forget learnt materials and refresh their memory before they forget,” Lu said.
This information could then be used to determine when review is necessary in order to sustain knowledge. Having the ability to measure retention would greatly improve disciplines that rely heavily on memorization, such as language study.
Xue, who received his Ph.D. in psychology from the Beijing Normal University, said the group’s main objective is to identify more beneficial methods of learning.
“Our goal is to try to find a scientific basis for effective learning,” he said.

USC was officially designated a safe community Wednesday morning by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre on Community Safety Promotion in a ceremony in front of Tommy Trojan.
Safety first · Paul Kells, president of Safe Communities Canada, gives a plaque recognizing USC as a safe community to Todd R. Dickey, senior vice president of administration. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
A WHO safe community designation indicates that a community has shown a strong network of collaboration that works toward the safety and wellness of its residents.
President C.L. Max Nikias, Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson and members of the U.S. National Safety Council and Safe Communities Canada were in attendance at the ceremony.
“It’s about personal safety, but it is much more than that. It is about helping each other to flourish; it’s about looking out for each other,” Nikias said. “I’m excited that now, on a global stage, with this official recognition our USC community has joined with other neighborhoods around the world.”
Donna Stein-Harris, director of the National Safety Council’s Safe Communities America efforts, spoke about USC’s place as a safety example for other universities.
“We know that USC is up to the task of sustaining this momentum for years to come,” Stein-Harris said. “The enthusiasm and inclusiveness is exemplary.”
Paul Kells, the founder and president of Safe Communities Canada, presented the university with a WHO flag and the official plaque designating the university as a safe community.
“You have truly engaged the community around you,” Kells said. “That is what is so magnificent, and that is actually the spirit and the framework that this will succeed with in the future.”

Flipping through TV channels, you can’t help but notice the dominance of celebrity coverage in the media. From their latest mishaps to their latest tantrums, the media is obsessed with reporting every aspect of the high life.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
But the other day I saw a celebrity on an unlikely channel: CNN. Angelina Jolie was talking about the Pakistani flood victims needing aid and other relief materials.
Celebrities advocating aid for natural disasters is nothing new. Sean Penn and George Clooney both campaigned heavily for Haitian earthquake victims while Scarlett Johansson was involved with Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.
The cynic in me initially scoffed at celebrity involvement in aid efforts. I assumed that they’re probably just trying to get favorable media coverage for themselves and gain more fans, and that it was all about their image in the public eye.
However, the optimist in me is starting to take over. How am I to know what exactly someone’s motive is in helping out natural disaster victims? Regardless of the reason behind doing such charity work, the fact remains that when celebrities get involved in relief efforts, the disaster itself gains coverage.
More coverage generally means more aid. More aid means a faster recovery for victims.
It’s obvious that fans care about what major projects their favorite stars are working on. Jolie’s current effort in Pakistan is helping spread awareness about the millions devastated by the floods to many who might not be following the news or reading the newspaper. Celebrities introduce global issues to an audience that might not normally be exposed to them.
Celebrities are also idols to many people — and how do people try to become like their idols? They copy them. It might only seem as though people are wearing the same clothes as their favorite superstar or eating at the same restaurant, but fans are just as likely to help out in their idol’s cause or philanthropy of choice.
This could mean a fan donating money to their favorite celebrity’s charity or even being so inspired that he flies down to a disaster area to volunteer.
That charity also spreads to college campuses, where there are many organizations that help aid efforts. Drives to raise money for food, clothes and other basic necessities following natural disasters such as the Haiti earthquake are common on campus. Colleges are natural hotbeds for such activism, so it should be no surprise at the large amount of relief effort shown here.
Opportunities to help out in natural disasters are easy to find on campuses but some people need a little bit of encouragement or inspiration to help out — and that inspiration can sometimes come from a celebrity they greatly admire.
It’s getting to the point where one expects celebrities to be support a cause. With such a large fan base, celebrities should be encouraged to use their broad spectrum of influence for beneficial causes. Their influence will help spread awareness about the world’s problems to new audiences and help bridge the gap between people in different nations.
Let’s hope celebrities continue to turn their large amount of media coverage into something positive.

Famous rock stars that serve as professors — those are our tuition dollars at work. And for good reason.
If you haven’t heard, rock musician Steve Miller has joined the USC faculty this semester to work with undergraduates in the popular music and music industry programs.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
When a university attracts acclaimed musicians such as Miller as  professors, it serves as a testament not only to the music school but also to the students that comprise it. Essentially, USC has the students Miller want to work with.
“Every time he comes into contact with students, he just comes away energized and wants to work with them on more of a sustained basis,” said Chris Sampson, associate dean of the Thornton School, to The New York Times.
On a larger scale, this is where USC students — and parents — can see the dividends of their tuition payments. USC’s ability to book talented professionals from all industries to serve as teachers and mentors is yet another sign of our unique academic standing among national universities.
Of course, it isn’t enough to just sit in on a lecture taught by an acclaimed professional in a given field. Though we have many resources at our disposal here on campus, the only way to take advantage of these opportunities is to reach out to professors the same way they reach out to us.
Just ask Peter Johnson, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance who plays the electric violin.
On top of being a member of a band on campus and having a Hollywood gig with Glee sensation Mark Salling, Johnson never hesitated to interact with Miller when he was a guest artist at USC in previous years.
“He’s pretty chill,” Johnson said. “He doesn’t instill nervousness. He really likes helping musicians.”
Johnson experienced firsthand what happens when you go out of your way to interact with a mentor — he performed with Miller last year during his concert at Bovard Auditorium.
These kinds of opportunities aren’t usually handed out. They require effort, persistence and drive on behalf of the students to take full advantage of USC’s premier strengths: professional learning and practical applications of what goes on in the classroom.
The obvious advantage is that, unlike other large universities, USC students don’t have to go too far to find these opportunities. Even staying five minutes after class to speak with a professor or guest speaker could get your foot in the door.
This is not to say that a one-on-one conversation with an admired professor or speaker will always end in a dream internship. But these mentors are paid to do what they do best — consult, advise and guide students toward their interests.
There are those, including some parents who foot the tuition bill, who suggest that the money going into a private college education might not produce benefits proportional to such a large expense. Andrew Hacker claimed in his Los Angeles Times op-ed, “College: Where the money goes,” that “Faculty stars may raise prestige, but they are often away from the classroom, having negotiated frequent paid leaves and smaller teaching loads — underwritten, of course, by tuition.”
That isn’t the case for many USC professors, including Miller, who not only provides critiques of his students but also frequently invites them to record with him in his Capital Records studio, according to USC News.
Although the discomfort of rising tuition is legitimate, it only scratches the surface of what’s at stake.
Trojan parents and students should not be misled — their tuition is an investment in a student’s ability to go the extra mile by interacting and networking with faculty and professionals unmatched by any other university. It’s an investment in the students’ professional growth and creativity — the best any parent can make.
No need to look further than the USC mission statement: “Our faculty are not simply teachers of the works of others but active contributors to what is taught, thought and practiced throughout the world.”
In time, perhaps we might add this statement: “Our students are not simply scholars of their respective majors but active participants in what they learn and contribute as the next generation of society’s leaders.”
Stephen Zelezny is a sophomore majoring in public relations. His column, “USC on the Move,” runs Thursdays.
I agree wholeheartedly with Vicki. Although I am sure that some students receive a variety of resources that may include faculty interaction, these claims are in no way substantial enough to support what you have said in this article. Hiring professors who are available and open to their students should be a requisite of all universities, not just of the expensive ones. And like Vicki has pointed out, interacting with faculty is more a byproduct of personal motivation than of tuition paid or salaries earned. It is also a little ridiculous to use one very limited example of faculty interaction and then make a general claim about USC as a whole–not all students are given these same opportunities. I read this and saw empty justifications for a problem that unfortunately affects many hardworking, frustrated students.
Interesting article, Stephen. 
I’m curious about your claim here though:
“…their tuition is an investment in a student’s ability to go the extra mile by interacting and networking with faculty and professionals unmatched by any other university.”
First, crucially, you have assumed that all students depend on their parents to foot the bill for college. Realistically, I would guess that many people are partially or fully responsible for financing their higher education.
Secondly, I agree that the cost of college in an investment in a person’s future, but the money itself ($50,000 a year) does not directly improve a student’s “ability” to interact with faculty. The desire to reach out and connect with professors and peers comes from personal motivation, not money.
Lastly, I am most concerned with your assertion that USC professors and faculty are “unmatched by any other university”. Even if you are writing an opinion piece, you can’t make claims that aren’t based in fact. There are numerous universities with excellent faculty, many comparable to that of ours and even some that are better, that cost the same or less than USC.

On Sept. 8, the Chevron gas station located on the corner of Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard closed shop to make way for construction of new luxury digs for USC students.
Alice Li | Daily Trojan
The Icon Company provides real estate self-proclaimed as “upscale mixed-use student housing … at top universities throughout California.” The Icon Company’s latest installment will be an apartment complex where the gas station once stood, finally providing the lap of luxury that ’SC students have longed for.
But wait, doesn’t USC already have two such complexes, one on either side of where Icon Plaza will be built?
Well, yes. Tuscany apartments was built a few short years ago while University Gateway opened its doors just this fall. Neither building is renting at full capacity, which is easily understandable given the one-two punch of a recession and the exorbitant price tags of the apartments.
We already have an excess of pricey apartments. What we do not have excess of are gas stations. Chevron was one of the closest to campus — tied with the ampm station on Vermont avenue and Exposition — and in its absence students will be forced to travel greater distances in search of fuel.
I considered Gateway a while back when I was still unsure of where to live the next time housing assignments rolled around. I was of course blown away by the luxe amenities and spacious rooms, but the price tag quickly brought me back to reality when we were casually told that our bill would total to roughly $12,000 for two semesters. Indulgence was simply too expensive for us (and about twice the cost of most university housing).
USC Housing certainly has its imperfections. Many of my friends were forced to turn to Tuscany or Gateway because their lottery times were such that the only options left were blocks away from campus, and they simply didn’t consider the distance feasible. Few among them actually chose these “finer” living arrangements before again trying their luck through USC Housing.
So what makes the future Icon Plaza so different — so much more splurge-worthy — than the rest? Icon has been advertised as glamorous, upscale — the high life. You can bet that the accompanying pricetag will be just as high. And if Gateway and Tuscany are already not fully occupied, how can The Icon Company be so sure that its venture will be more successful? True, the project’s plans probably didn’t take the recession into account, but shouldn’t the company consider a more reasonable set-up in lieu of its current lavish layout? If making money is its ultimate goal, then it seems in its best interest to edit its plans in accordance with the current economic climate.
The Icon Plaza website pitches the building through a 90210-esque lens, promising that students who choose the apartments will enjoy the “most coveted address” at USC. I’m still unclear on how this address — on the corner of Figueroa and Exposition — will be so much more exclusive than either Tuscany or Gateway (which are, incidentally, both located along Figueroa and less than half a mile in either direction of this “coveted” corner.)
In an obvious attempt to market the Icon Plaza as the ultimate utopia of living arrangements, the Icon Company seems to have forgotten that not too long ago — as recently as this fall, in fact — other housing corporations attempted to do the same, and that their success has been lukewarm at best. Desperately, the Gateway promotions and price cuts are routinely broadcast by sign-twirling men located on the corner of Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard, and on-campus bikers boasting swag upon signing and peddling the message to “Go Gateway.”
The Icon Company needs to re-evaluate its premises. True, its mission statement is to deliver the very best accommodations — but the very best by whose standards? Is the scale simply one of ascending opulence? It’s no secret that USC needs more housing closer to campus, but this won’t be a viable solution for the middle majority of its student body. The relative failure of Gateway should be proof enough that even if USC has been labeled the “University of Spoiled Children,” few people are quite so affluent or willing to pay that extra amount.
The company should reconfigure its plans and give students what they really want and, more importantly, need: modest, convenient and affordable housing.
Deepa Ramprasad is a sophomore majoring in public relations.
@Rob — Oh yes, arguing in favor of cheaper housing options clearly communicates being spoiled.
/sarcasm
If you will allow me to play the devils advocate, consider the fact that there are quite a few of wealthy individuals who do crave luxury living arrangements.  On the other hand, I agree with a lot of you who for obvious reasons believe that building, yet another, apartment complex does not do much for the morale of folks who do not feel comfortable driving a couple or simply a few miles away where the neighborhood might be considered hazardous to your health.lol…but in all seriousness.  I think that it is important to have townhall meetings or some kind of hearing to allow all stake holders to voice their opinions on what is built around this place.  With that said, if housing is too  high and you need a place to live.. email me to get the scoop on a nice place thats a block away from school…and best of all, you wont have to worry about gas stations or any other outrageous living costs.  call me at three two three three one three five two five seven!!
Are you only driving around your own neighborhood? No? Then just buy gas wherever it is you’re driving to!
Seriously, there are like 4 gas stations within 2 miles of the campus, and there is such a low precentage of people on campus with cars. I live in Los Angeles, and I choose not to bring my car to campus, and I only know a small handful of people who actually do have a car here. What we need is more Transit-Oriented Development, and for the Expo Line to open sooner. 
Also, while I agree that new housing should be cheaper, not in the style of Gateway or Tuscany, will you listen to yourself? “If making money is its ultimate goal, then it seems in its best interest to edit its plans in accordance with the current economic climate.” How in the wide world of sports does that make any sense? The thing about the current economic climate is that in a few years, it will be totally different. Meanwhile, the choices made about development now will be in place for probably 50 years at least.
There is already a glut of affordable housing options in the USC neighborhood.
No, it isn’t deluxe, or new.  LA City Housing rules make it virtually impossible to rehab a building properly, and most of the housing stock about USC is 40-100 years old, desperately in need of rebuilding or replacement.  So the only projects that pencil out are those who can navigate LA City, which means you will only get colossal “luxury” buildings.
I agree that there needs to be more affordable housing, which is what most of the article seems to be about.
The title and the whole thing about gas is ridiculously stupid though.  If you need gas, then you obviously have a vehicle…why can’t you drive one block down the street to the Chevron on MLK?  Oh man, it is 1 minute further away that is too much!  Or, as someone else said, there’s the 76 on Vermont and Adams and another Chevron further up Vermont.
Go to Icon Plaza’s website (http://www.fpmrealty.com/icon/iconatusc.html) and look at the building they show….last time I checked that wasn’t Doheny or Bovard.
They’re doing you a favor. That gas station was overpriced. It’s all about the 76 kitty corner to Ralphs!
“The company should reconfigure its plans and give students what they really want and, more importantly, need: modest, convenient and affordable housing.”
Finally someone said it.  Over half of USC students are on financial aid and many of them receive federal Pell Grants.  The last thing we need are more luxury apartments when the only affordable options are far-too limited USC housing and buildings run by slum lords like Nupac and the old Conquest.  I don’t need a building with a pool, gym and spa, or concierge service.  Just give me a usable, clean, non-luxury apartment.
A gas station is the worst use of space near a major university. The author seems to be extremely entitled. Not only does he assume that a majority of students drive, and thus need gas, he complains about a slightly longer drive. Where is the author driving? Surely not across campus. He’s probably driving further out, and thus could easily pick up gas on the way to and from the beach or the mall. 
And if the author thinks housing is too expensive, then the solution is to build more of it. Econ 101. As supply increases, but demand hold steady (same student base), prices fall. If the other luxury housing units aren’t full, then price drops will follow until they are at capacity.
Bottom line, USC needs the housing.  There simply isn’t enough housing in the area to house all the students.  USC knows this and developers know this, which is why we are getting an influx of new housing, such as Icon, or the other 7 story apartment complex that is under construction at roughly 27th and Figueroa (next to Taco Bell).   Most of these apartment complexes will be classified as “luxury” to gain a reputation and to try and build a demand.  However, supply and demand with all these new beds will decrease prices over time.  We have already seen Gateway lower prices and Tuscany did the same over summer.  While this was just slight increases as time goes on and new beds are built prices will continue to decrease. It will take time, it won’t be overnight, but it is increasing, not to mention that USC is in final review of plans for 5000 beds where the University Village/Cardinal Gardens/La Sorbonne/and Century are currently built that will be put in over 2 phases.
As for the gas station, this housing outweighs the gas station.  Not to mention there is a gas station to the north on Adams/Figueroa or there is the USC gas station that is just across the freeway.  There are also gas stations on 23/Hoover and Vermont/Adams, as well as the one mentioned on Vermont/Exposition.  Almost every way you would go away from campus there is a gas station, and there does not need to be one across the street.
You seem to say that USC students don’t deserve to be called “spoiled.” Yet you and your friends complain that a “few blocks” is too far to live from campus and you will “be forced to travel greater distances in search of fuel.” Being unwilling to spend 15 minutes riding a bike to campus or 5 minutes driving to get gas sounds pretty spoiled to me (and if you aren’t driving as far as another gas station, why are you driving in the first place?).

Last week the group Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP) said passing Proposition 19, which aims to legalize marijuana in the state of California, would enable police to focus on more pressing issues.
LEAP is a Massachusetts-based non-profit organization consisting of current and former police officers and other government and law enforcement agents opposed to the “War on Drugs.”
The group’s support of the measure stems from arguments claiming that existing drug laws actually facilitate availability of marijuana to youth and that government regulation and taxation, if implemented, would prove more effective means of reducing said availability.
Additionally, some 60 percent of the money going directly to violent drug cartels is from the illegal selling of marijuana, San Jose Police Chief Joseph McNamara said to the San Francisco Chronicle.
Support for the legalization of drugs is not commonly found in the realm of law enforcement.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the California Police Chiefs Association does not support Proposition 19. The association believes legalization would encourage marijuana use and subsequent criminal activity.
Fortunately for California’s voting population, these competing interests hold minimal influence come November 2, 2010. Passage of Proposition 19 depends only on a simple majority by California voters.
The Service Employees International Union also endorsed the marijuiana measure.

The Heisman Trophy Trust, following Reggie Bush’s decision to give up his Heisman Trophy, has decided against naming a replacement winner of the 2005 award.
“As a result of Reggie Bush’s decision to forfeit his title as Heisman winner of 2005, the Trustees have determined that there will be no Heisman Trophy winner for the year 2005,” a statement from the Trust read.
Due to the Trust’s decision, Vince Young, the 2005 runner-up, will not receive the award. Young, however, is unperturbed.
“I would not want to have it, and don’t want the trophy… 2005 Reggie Bush is the Heisman Trophy winner. Why would I want it?” Young told reporters on Wednesday.
College football players must be in compliance with NCAA rules to be eligible to receive the Heisman Trophy.
The NCAA deemed Bush ineligible for the 2005 season and hit USC hard with sanctions when it was discovered that Bush, along with basketball player O.J. Mayo, accepted lavish gifts from an outside agency during their time at USC.
The NCAA’s discoveries left the option open for the Trust to take away Bush’s award on account of his ineligibility in the 2005 season. Bush, however, did not give the Heismab Trust the chance by giving up his Heisman willingly on Tuesday.
This is the first time in its 75-year history that the Heisman Trophy has been returned by one of its recipients.

It has been a very interesting month for Internet giants. In the last 30 days, Facebook unveiled the geo-location game, Digg launched a new version of its site and Google launched its real-time Google Instant.
Now Twitter is joining the fray. Yesterday, the social and informational networking site unveiled its largest changes in years yesterday.
The new Twitter, which is currently only available to a handful of users – the actual site progressive over  the next few weeks –  splits the main page into two columns. The left column features the traditional Twitter feed, while the right offers an expanded look on tweets.
When a user clicks on a tweet, the tweeter’s profile, the tweet and any links show up in the right-hand column.
Although the actual Twitter website leads its competitors in terms of use, a large portion of users use third-party Twitter applications like Hootsuite and Tweetdeck, often on mobile platforms such as iPhones. While Twitter launched a recent in-house mobile app, according to its data  78 percent of users access it through the web browser version.
This redesign looks to be an attempt to raise that number and to win over third-party users.
In a way, it seems like Twitter is trying to be the new Google: A giant app developer instead of an app used on various platforms. Eliminating third-party developers could be a bad move; the developers helped Twitter grow into the giant it is today.
If Twitter’s ultimate goal is to cut out those middlemen, then it might lose some innovative ideas.
Overall, the new Twitter looks to be a very effective update to the networking site. It retains both the basic look and simplicity of the past design, while still providing plenty of new features that offer a wider experience on the website.
It seems to be easy and intuitive to use, and it affectively turns Twitter into a one stop location for media, instead of simply being a home to links to other sites.

Former USC star running back Reggie Bush beat the Heisman Trophy Trust to the punch Tuesday when he forfeited his 2005 Heisman Trophy. That same day, he released a statement peppered with public relations-friendly phrases.
Fallen · Bush’s Heisman forfeiture makes him the first award winner to ever have the honor recinded. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
Bush talked about how winning the Heisman was “a dream come true” and gave credit for winning the award to his teammates, coaches, fans and family.
What a good guy.
But the thing that everyone had been waiting to hear was buried near the end of the statement: an admission of guilt.
“I would like to begin the effort to turn a negative situation into a positive one by working with the Trustees to establish an educational program which will assist student-athletes and their families avoid the mistakes that I made,” Bush said in the statement.
In the last five years, Bush has rarely spoken in public about the allegations concerning his dealings with two prospective sports agents during his time at USC. Even when the NCAA found Bush to have taken part in the wrongdoing, he only said that he was “disappointed by [the] decision” and “disagreed with the findings.”
Finally, Bush got off his Heisman high horse and admitted to his mistakes. It confirmed what we all already knew. We just wanted to hear it from him.
After watching the Trojans limp through their first two victories because of the fallout from Bush’s actions, many fans have expressed the desire to see Bush tangibly punished. Over the last week, everyone has had an opinion about what should happen to Bush’s Heisman Trophy.
Bush chose to go with self-flagellation.
If Bush had manned up to his transgressions earlier, there might have been some honor in his forfeiture. But at this point, when he was probably just a Trustees’ meeting away from losing the trophy anyway, I can’t commend Bush for his actions.
Bush (or his P.R. people, at least) clearly made this move to try to help his injured image. Unfortunately for him, it’s too late.
Essentially, Bush has been blacklisted and removed from USC football history as if he never existed, à la George Orwell’s government in 1984. USC fans also want to pretend that he never existed because they have already lost so much at his expense. Glancing around the Coliseum during Saturday’s home opener, you would have been hard-pressed to find a single No. 5 jersey among the crowd.
So does Bush’s veiled admission of guilt help his image at all? Not a lick. For those that called Bush a cheater, this just confirms that sentiment.
But let’s set the record straight: Bush did not cheat the same way Barry Bonds did. He was the best college football player in 2005 and thus deserved to win that trophy.
The fact that he received improper benefits, however, reverses that. If USC has to pay in very real ways — scholarship reductions, postseason bans — then so should Bush.
Whether Bush chose to give the Heisman Trophy back or was stripped of it is irrelevant. USC made up its mind about Bush’s legacy when it chose to send his replica Heisman back. So did his fans when they chose to leave his jersey at home.
The question now turns to what happens to the Heisman Trophy itself.
The Trust has not said whether there will be no winner for that year or if the runner-up, Vince Young, will receive the award. (Although Young has already stated he would accept the award if it were offered to him.)
But does it really matter? Bush has already been embarrassed enough. He is the first winner of the Heisman to return the trophy and he is no longer welcome at the school he brought so much money and so many accolades to.
Bush will be out of luck if he’s looking for sympathy. Compared to what his university is going through, he’s getting off easy.
At the very least, USC can now move on with the reassurance that the man already known to be guilty has finally come to grips with it himself.
“Middle Ground” usually runs Tuesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Josh at jjovanel@usc.edu.
The only thing peppered about Reggie Bush is the how hot he was on the field for the Trojans. You know something, writers have a responsibility NOT TO INJECT their personal biases into their editorials, regardless of whether it’s an editorial. BE FAIR! Tell two sides. Why not go after the recruiters who entice talented BLACK football players to come to their schools, by dangling a car or new home or whatever over their heads? I know why, it’s easier to demonize a black man than it is to expose a white one! It’s terrible to think that all those ticket sales from all those years, from all those black football players running up and down the field, catching all those balls, making all those fans CREAM , has amounted to nothing but a BLACKLIST for the black player the moment a white man entices the black man to do wrong. As an editor, and a human, you’re one unevenhanded fool. The best thing the Daily Trojan can do is prevent someone like me from becoming EDITOR in CHEIF. My advice to you is to avoid getting your bubble popped. So when the GENIUS in me decides to open an HBCU in So. Cal and take all the black athlete students away from these cash cow schools, we’ll see how irrelevant we are to USC then. We’ll be crackin helmets en masse, and your ticket sales will be virtually non-existent! USC STILL NEEDS THE LIKES OF REGGIE BUSH TO THIS VERY DAY….CLOWNS
Josh: What do you base your writing on? Did you do a poll to find out whether the alumn base wanted an apology from Bush? I personally didn’t. It’s sad that all this happened and it will be best to put it to rest, bury the dead. You write as if you’re the king of the hill with omniscient divine prowess to divine. It seems you have much to learn in academics and real life.

Tracy Lawrence is a hard-core foodie who lives to eat — and is proud of it.
But Lawrence, a senior majoring in business administration, doesn’t just want to feed herself. She wants to feed others too, which is why she and fellow student Maggy Wahba created The Dish Dash, an online dining guide catering specifically to USC students.
Sweet deals · The Dish Dash offers exclusive discounts at a variety of food locations, including Syrup Desserts located on Spring Street. - Photo courtesy of The Dish Dash
The inspiration sparked from a scenario that Lawrence faced year after year: Students from across the country and world come to USC, excited about the school, but are soon disappointed by the city.
“As an Angeleno, it broke my heart to see that,” Lawrence said. “The transition to L.A. is so difficult for freshmen. They want to understand and feel [like a] part of the city, but L.A. is complex and dynamic. You really need to immerse yourself in it, instead of just getting lost in the USC bubble.”
Many students also have misconceptions about Los Angeles, Lawrence said. They think that to have a good time, they must travel to places that are either far away or expensive.
But Lawrence has made it her mission to dispel that false notion. She wants to show students the city by drawing them out of USC’s red-bricked walls and onto the streets of Downtown, the largely overlooked district just 10 minutes away from campus.
“People think Downtown is this empty financial district that is either expensive or ghetto,” Lawrence said.
But Downtown Los Angeles is slowly transforming. Outdated and vacant office buildings are being renovated into lofts and luxury apartments. New residents are settling down and creating a community. Investors and business people are starting to take notice, and they are building shops and restaurants around the new houses.
While interning at dineLA, a program that is in charge of the dineLA Restaurant Week, Lawrence had the opportunity to talk to several restaurateurs who expressed their desire to reach out to students. At the same time, many of Lawrence’s friends were seeking her advice on dining out.
“Friends always told me that I should write a food blog,” Lawrence said. “I thought, ‘Well I like food, but how can I share it with people I know?’ Then I thought about USC students and what they need in terms of dining. ”
In a natural progression of ideas and events, The Dish Dash was born. With all the changes taking place in Downtown, The Dish Dash steps in to spread the word on the two main interests of all college students: discounts and good food.
To Lawrence, food is the bridge between students and Downtown Los Angeles. The concept is simple: Seek out quality restaurants in Downtown, work with them to provide a deal for students, bring students to the restaurant and turn it into a hot spot. A win-win situation.
Lawrence’s vision took root in February 2009, but only took off the following fall semester during an entrepreneurship class where she proposed her project to Wahba, a senior majoring in business administration and psychology.
Wahba jumped right on board. As a fellow foodie, she shared Lawrence’s enthusiasm for bringing a customized, diverse dining experience to USC students.
“It’s exciting to be part of The Dish Dash,” Wahba said. “As a business student and someone who is interested in entrepreneurship, this is just the perfect thing to be involved in. But the best thing is being able to make a difference for students who I interact with daily.”
Several others have climbed on board as well —  all USC students whose common ground is a real enthusiasm for the university community. This passion is critical, because none of them, including Lawrence, are paid for their work. The initial investment money came out of their own pockets. Those involved say they do it for nothing but the pure pride and satisfaction of serving students through The Dish Dash.
“We are the prime explorers,” Lawrence said. “We call ourselves the ‘Downtown specialists.’ It’s our job to go to restaurants and try them out. If we like them, we invite them to The Dish Dash.”
Lawrence and her team look for two criteria before deciding to review a restaurant: reasonable prices and good quality.
“We only want the best of the best,” she said. “It’s our name on the line and we want restaurants that reflect us well.”
Because they are all still students, The Dish Dash team gets a leg up from other typical dining guides in that it understands student needs: what they want, where they can go, when they go and what their budget is. So far, responses from restaurants have been positive, Lawrence said. Most restaurants are looking for more business from students, and they know a primary way to lure them in is through discounts.
Another way The Dish Dash tries to foster a relationship between USC and Downtown Los Angeles is by offering a discounted catering service for student and faculty organizations.  
“We want to get students out, but also bring a lot of great options to campus,” Wahba said. “We just want to extend options for both sides, and we want The Dish Dash to be the go-to source for feeding people good, reasonably priced food.”
Barely four weeks have passed since the launch on Aug. 15, and The Dish Dash’s website already has had 6,000 views and 280 subscribers — and the figures continue to grow. The Dish Dash has eight partner restaurants: Katsuya, Starry Kitchen, Urban Noodle, Señor Fish, ESPN Zone, Bacaro LA, Cole’s: Originator of the French Dip and Homegirl Café. More deals are in the works, and The Dish Dash is open to any student’s comments or suggestions.
“I want to make The Dish Dash national and rule the world,” Lawrence said laughing, before adding more seriously, “Wherever there is a student who’s hungry, we want to help them.”
But USC students should first help themselves, she said, by putting away their cell phones and stepping away from Facebook. In the end, she said, it’s really not about the food. The food is just a supplement to a social situation.
“Go out,” Lawrence said. “Go out to the restaurants, explore your city, see the culture, see the art and enjoy the food and social atmosphere.”
El Cholo used to offer USC students with id a discount and McCormick and Smidt’s restaurant also had a happy hour discount of a burger, coke and fries for $5.00 so perhaps you should check them out and see if they are still offering deals to USC students.  Regards Kate Lane

Over the course of the last few weeks, the question of “Will he or won’t he?” has been the big elephant in Heritage Hall. The question revolves around former USC star running back Reggie Bush and his now-infamous 2005 Heisman Trophy.
The end · Former USC star running back Reggie Bush, seen here rushing in 2005, returned the Heisman Trophy he won with the Trojans that season on Tuesday, The move preceeded an anticipated decision on the matter by the Heisman Trust. - Daily Trojan file photo 
There were murmurs and increased speculation about whether Bush would lose his Heisman, but still the Heisman Trophy Trust had made no decision.
On Tuesday, the climax of this cat-and-mouse game finally came to a head-scratching halt when Bush announced he would concede his trophy, marking the first time in the prestigious award’s history that a recipient has given back the honor.
“For me, it was a dream come true. But I know that the Heisman is not mine alone,” Bush said in a statement. “Far from it. I know that my victory was made possible by the discipline and hard work of my teammates, the steady guidance of my coaches, the inspiration of the fans and the unconditional love of my family and friends. And I know that any young man fortunate enough to win the Heisman enters into a family of sorts. Each individual carries the legacy of the award and each one is entrusted with its good name.”
“I am determined to view this event as an opportunity to help others and to advance the values and mission of the Heisman Trophy Trust,” he said.
Bush’s role in the NCAA violations has contributed to the  stranglehold over the athletic program for the next two years, in which the Trojans face bowl ineligibility and a reduction of 30 scholarships.
The former Trojan running back’s off-field activities, however, pale in comparison to the actions of previous Heisman winners.
The Oklahoma Sooners’ running back Billy Sims the 1978 award winner, was so far in debt and back child support he sold his trophy to clear almost $33,000 from his name. Billy Cannon, the 1959 Heisman winner from Louisiana State University, spent nearly three years in prison for his role in a counterfeiting scheme in the early 1980s. And who can forget arguably the greatest running back in USC history, O.J. Simpson, whose reputation needs no introduction.
But none of these men or any of the individuals with whom they share the renowned honor has ever given back the award, or been forced to give it up — except Bush.
In regards to the matter, USC coach Lane Kiffin stated flatly that it didn’t affect his memories of the 2005 season.
“He doesn’t have to give it back,” Kiffin said. “This is his decision to do and I respect that. I don’t  think of that season any differently. I think it was a great year until the last 6 minutes of the game, when he were up 2 scores and gave it away. Other than that, I have good memories of that season.”
Kiffin also pointed out that Bush’s situation hasn’t affected the current team in any way, simply because of how much time has passed since the tailback attended USC.
“None of [the current team] was here when [Bush] was here,” Kiffin said. “So it’s not as big a deal to them as you might think. We didn’t even discuss it in the team meeting. The only reason I brought it up was so they weren’t surprised when [the media] asked them.”
Though it would not comment on whether the meeting was about Bush, the Trust was supposed to hold its monthly meeting Tuesday afternoon in New York City.
USC returned its copy of Bush’s Heisman Trophy to the Heisman Trophy Trust in July, shortly after the announcement of the NCAA sanctions against the school.
Though there is no way to erase the 1,740 rushing yards, 478 receiving yards and 18 touchdowns that Bush amassed during his junior season in 2005, his decision ends a drawn-out process that included himself, the university, and the Heisman Trust for months following the NCAA sanctions.
Dave, you wrote, “But none of these men or any of the individuals with whom they share the renowned honor has ever given back the award, or been forced to give it up — except Bush.”  The BIG difference between Bush and the others you mentioned is that Bush was an ineligible player during the season that he won the trophy.  He covered up his schemes and dealings with an agent and now he has to suffer the humiliation of giving the trophy back.  His weak response when returning it shows he has not taken personal responsibility for his actions and has no remorse for the damage he caused to his alma mater.  Yes, it was a great season to remember, but it was marred by one man’s lack of character.  May all who follow also remember our university’s motto, ““Let him bear the palm, who deserves it.”

If cities were alcoholic beverages, Los Angeles would be a mix of vodka and Red Bull — a potent dose of liquor hidden beneath the sugary-sweet sheen of a counterintuitive energy boost.
San Diego, just a few hours south, would be defined by its main boozy creation, one rooted in a working-class ethic that has been around millenniums longer than Red Bull’s wing-giving jolt: hand-crafted beer.
As far back as Ancient Egypt, humans have been fermenting grains to make alcoholic beer-like beverages and yet recipes are still constantly in flux.
After centuries of Belgian and German brewing traditions dominating world consumption, beer-lovers have recently been looking to the United States for guidance on how to push the boundaries of the craft.
This concept might seem weird for anyone who thinks of the ultra-yellow macro brews Budweiser and Miller Light as “traditional” American beers. But those willing to look beyond the 7-Eleven beer cooler will easily find that new availability of ingredients and the exploration of non-traditional brewing methods have made the last few decades some of the most innovative in beer history, with small-batch craft breweries slowly creeping into the mainstream breweries’ market share.
This feat is most surprising in the United States, where Prohibition eliminated our flourishing dark-beer culture and replaced it with watered-down, rice-infused drinks that maximized bootleggers’ profits but ruined our craving for craftsmanship.
Cities such as Portland, Ore., Denver and the aforementioned San Diego have been cultivating this return to experimentalism, primarily because of their blue-collar history and emerging DIY identity.
A shift is in progress in Los Angeles — a metropolis once better known for its Hollywood-fueled liquor scene than its young-but-earnest community of beer geeks. The last two years have seen the city’s appreciation for craft beer grow exponentially as a surge of gastropubs, alehouses, breweries and taverns have opened up from the Valley to the Westside to Downtown, joining the few stalwart beer institutions such as Father’s Office in Santa Monica and Lucky Baldwin’s in Pasadena.
This first round of new businesses — most of which opened during 2008 — led distant, car-fueled residents to neighborhood meeting points and slowly introduced our bland, mostly mainstream beer tastes to the multi-faceted world of hand-crafted beer.
In the last few months, however, another set of beer-centric establishments have opened across the city, taking advantage of L.A.’s newfound sense of exploration and widening the city’s beer horizons even more.
Pushing the gastropub concept another step toward the specialty bar, new hangouts such as West Hollywood’s Surly Goat, Burbank’s Tony’s Darts Away, Venice Beach’s Venice Ale House and Long Beach’s Congregation Ale House (full disclosure: I work there) are scaling down the food menu and offering a wider berth of more unique beers than ever.
The idea — Eagle Rock Brewery co-founder Jeremy Raub told the Los Angeles Times when he opened the brewery’s tasting room two years ago — is to “inspire Angelenos to dig themselves out of the domestic beer rut and dive into the wide world of craft brewing.”
To do this, the city’s alcohol consumers don’t necessarily have to swear off tall boys of Pabst Blue Ribbon, but instead alter their ideas of drinking in general. Long used in Los Angeles — especially by the city’s college students — as a way to encourage a party atmosphere, beer has the ability to be so much more.
If we stop drinking weak, urine-colored beer as a means to an end and start dabbling in more uncommon styles such as Saisons, Dopple Weizens and imperial red ales, beer becomes less about getting drunk as quickly as possible and more about appreciating taste and quality the way you would a fine wine.
Like many things in Los Angeles, however, this emerging beer scene has not been created autonomously. Because three of beer’s main four ingredients — malted barley, yeast and hops — cannot be grown in Southern California, local brewers are mostly reliant on out-of-state ingredients, many of which are available to brave home brewers through supply stores throughout town.
More importantly, because the city’s beer identity is still forming, Los Angeles does not yet have a hometown style.
Belgian, British and German beer styles are all international staples — think Hefenweizen, porters and golden ales — and even certain beer-producing cities in the states have gained recognition for their local brews (such as San Diego’s complex, ultra-bitter imperial IPAs and the Pacific Northwest’s emerging beer style, Cascade Dark Ale). But both brewers and outlets in Los Angeles have thus far been confined to recognizable tastes, no doubt in an effort to appeal to the majority of the city that has yet to acquire a palette for craft beer.
The new flock of bars sprouting up across the Greater Los Angeles area, however, is providing the crucial next step for those who envision this city as a diverse craft beer town.
With the focus of many of these restaurants and bars not on the gluttonous aspect of consuming beer, young brewmasters and bartenders are able to offer a range of local and international microbrews, many meant for sipping in specially branded glasses, not for chugging through a funnel attached to a hose.
There will always be a place in Los Angeles nightlife for vodka-Red Bulls and tall-can specials, but with the promising roots of good beer craftsmanship already making themselves manifest in this sprawling metropolis, it just doesn’t seem fair to subject your liver to the liquor-fueled decadence of yore.

Response to the op-ed
I wanted to correct some misinformation that was included in the Daily Trojan Op-Ed on Sept. 10 which indicated USC has a “free-speech zone.”  No such zone exists on campus.
The author also implies that the university does not respect free speech rights.  This too is false.  As stated in the 2010-2011 version of SCampus (the student guidebook):
“The university recognizes the crucial importance of preserving First Amendment rights and maintaining open communication and dialogue in the process of identifying and resolving problems which arise in the dynamics of life in a university community. The legitimate expression of differing opinions and concerns, including unpopular, controversial or dissident viewpoints, is an essential element of the academic process.”
She also incorrectly states that students must give the university two weeks’ notice in order to peacefully protest.  Once again, this is an incorrect assertion.
It is truly unfortunate that Ms. Wang paints such an inaccurate picture of the university’s strong support for the important concepts of free expression.  Just a few years ago, students at the university met with the administration to refine our policies and practices to ensure that student rights were protected.  These meetings included the Undergraduate Student Government, Graduate and Professional Student Senate, and other student organizations.  Our discussions resulted in the current policy, which preserves student rights and allows for peaceful expression and dissent.
I encourage all students to read the policy that can be found in the 2010-2011 SCampus (http://web-app.usc.edu/scampus/).

Correction: 9/14/10 – “Free speech at private colleges not so free” (Sept. 10) referenced a 20-foot free-speech zone around Tommy Trojan.  This zone was in fact abolished several years ago after a meeting between administrators and student representatives. The article also quoted an outdated section from SCampus, which has since changed to include a blanket free-speech policy for USC’s campus.
The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.
Free speech can help us to explain more compare to professional one. What you think about it?
Checkmate.
