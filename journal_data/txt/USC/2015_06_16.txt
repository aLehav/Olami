In the movie capital of the world, a popular outdoor movie series offering good music and good eats delivers a cinema experience fitting of its famous setting. The Eat See Hear series, hosted in neighborhoods throughout the Los Angeles area, re-imagined the idea of a drive-in movie by incorporating pre-show performances by live bands, a curated selection of food trucks and picnicking attendees. Created by Los Angeles-based Trailhead Marketing, Inc. founders Jeff and Sharon Sperber, the Eat See Hear series will run on Saturday nights for 19 consecutive weeks from May through September. The series was prominently featured in Curbed LA’s “2015 Guide to Los Angeles Outdoor Movie Screenings” and will include fan favorites such as Almost Famous, Zoolander, Back to the Future and the Breakfast Club.
“Our backgrounds are in experiential marketing and event marketing and production, so we created this series that brought together our different skillsets, coupled with what is quintessential to Los Angeles: movies, music and food trucks,” Sharon Sperber said.
This year’s venues include Santa Monica High School’s Memorial Greek Amphitheater, The Autry in Griffith Park, Centennial Square at Pasadena City Hall  and one show at La Cienega Park in Beverly Hills. During its first season, Fandango sponsored the Eat See Hear series, but this year, the program is partnering with Showtime, which is in its third year of sponsorship.
“When we started, we did 12 different venues over 17 weeks, and now we’re in four venues over 19 weeks,” Sharon Sperber said. “What we realized is that when we had 12 different locations, is that is was like going from L.A. to San Francisco to Chicago to New York to Boston . . . every market that makes up L.A. County is completely different. We really just created efficiencies of scale.”
The series offers viewers a high quality visual experience on a three-story high, 52-foot-wide image on a Harkness inflatable movie screen — boasted as the largest west of the Mississippi — with 15,000-30,000 lumens and state of the art line-array audio. The producers of the series utilize separate audio systems for the live music performance and the movie, including JBL VRX932 line array tops, VRX918 subs,and a 42,000 watt sound system.
This year, as some former outdoor movie options such as Grand Park have discontinued movie series, Eat See Hear now battles for the top spot with competitors Street Food Cinema, hosted by TIL Lifestyle Marketing, and Cinespia, in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.
“We really put together the highest quality production, and that’s what sets us apart . . . That and all of our events are 100 percent dog-friendly,” Sharon Sherber said. “We love dogs, and at the end of our season, a portion of our ticket sales goes to Best Friends Los Angeles Society and the No-Kill Los Angeles movement.”
Leashed canines of all kinds are welcomed to the event with a free biscuit, and water bowls are located around the venue.
Each week, Eat See Hear hosts a different set of L.A. food truck favorites, including options such as Peaches Smokehouse BBQ, Roll’n Lobster, The Pudding Truck, Coolhaus, Farmer’s Belly and Brasil Kiss. Highlights of the Peaches BBQ menu include the Fried Okra, the Southern Patty Melt with Pimento Cheese, and the “Redneck Nachos” (waffle fries topped with tangy pulled pork and seasoned sour cream).
Eat See Hear also offers music to listen to while attendees chow down. This season, Eat See Hear has hosted groups that include the Dark Furs, Dutch Party and Milo Bloom. On July 25, the series will host USC favorite The Neighbors, featuring senior Max Subar.
“We keep our finger on the pulse of what is going on in the music scene . . . We stay more on the indie side. It’s a little bit of our own taste,” Sharon Sherber said.
This fall, Eat See Hear will be expanding to Las Vegas, launching a nine-week series just outside of Vegas in Henderson, Nevada, beginning Labor Day weekend on Friday nights through November.
Jeff Sperber expressed plans to continue offering top-quality outdoor movie experiences in the future.
“We really just wanted to be best in class. This is a town that’s built on movies and music, and we wanted to be able to provide both of those in a way that nobody else in town is doing . . . It looks the way we wanted it to look, and it flows the way we wanted it to flow.”
Tickets are $12 for advance general admission, $14 at the door, $8 for children under 12 and free for children under 5.

Even if you aren’t a vegan, you can still enjoy some vegan treats. But who said the vegan treats have to always be unhealthy? Of course a double chocolate chip cookie is always delicious, but why not try a chocolate chip oatmeal cookie sweetened with dates and bananas? Or what about doughnuts that are not fried, but baked? They are more hardy and you do not feel like you are stuffing your face with sugar. Why not give them a try?  Here are some easy recipes you can whip together and impress your vegan friends – if you don’t eat them all first.
Double Chocolate Chip Cookies
Total time: 15 minutes
Makes 12 large cookies
Ingredients:
– 3⁄4 cup coconut oil
– 2 cups sugar (I used coconut palm sugar)
– 2 teaspoons vanilla
– 1 tablespoon flax seed, plus
– 1 teaspoon flax seed
– 1⁄2 cup almond milk
– 2 cups coconut flour
– 3⁄4 cup cocoa powder
– 1 teaspoon baking soda
– 1⁄2 teaspoon salt
– 1 1⁄2 cups vegan dark chocolate chips
Instructions:
1. Preheat oven 350  degrees Fahrenheit
2. Grind 1 tablespoon flax seed.
3. Add the almond milk. Blend for a few seconds. Let that rest for 15 minutes to allow the flax seeds to soak up the milk – this is essentially the “egg” of the recipe.
4. In another bowl mix your dry ingredients: flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.
5. Cream the sugar and oil for 5 minutes. (Creaming is blending the two ingredients with a high power blender. The sugar/oil combination is your leavening agent; therefore, the longer you cream, the “fluffier” your cookies will be.)
6. Add flax/milk mixture to your sugar/oil. Mix well.
7.   Add vanilla.
8. Slowly mix in dry ingredients.
9. Mix your chocolate chips.
10. Either oil or put parchment paper on your baking sheet. Make 12 cookies. Cook 10-12 minutes.

Healthy Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies
Total time: 15 minutes
Makes 12 cookies
Ingredients:
– 1 cup dates, packed (soaked for 10 minutes in warm water and then drained)
– 1 medium ripe banana
– 2 tablespoons all natural, salted almond butter or peanut butter
– 3/4 cup almond meal (ground from raw almonds)
– 3/4 cup gluten free rolled oats
–  Vegan chocolate chips
–  Sliced almonds
Instructions:
1. Add dates to a food processor and pulse until only small bits remain.
2. Add banana and almond butter and mix again until combined, scraping down the sides as needed.
3. Next, add the almond meal and rolled oats and pulse until a loose dough is formed. It will be kind of wet and sticky. I added a little more almond meal (until I could form the dough into balls), about ¼ cup.
4. At this point, you can add in 2 tablespoons of the chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of the sliced almonds. Then chill dough for 10 minutes and preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
5. Wet your hands (to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands) and scoop out 2 tablespoon amounts of cookie dough. Form dough into loose discs, then arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet. They won’t expand so pack them closer together.
6. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown and somewhat firm to the touch.
7. Remove and let set for a few minutes on the pan, then carefully transfer to a plate or cooling rack to cool. Enjoy!

Maple Glaze Doughnuts
Total time: 15 minutes
Makes 12
Ingredients:
– 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
– 1/2 cup stevia (or whatever sugar)
– 1 teaspoon salt
– 1 teaspoon baking powder
– 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
– 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (fresh grated is best!)
– 1 1/3 cup vanilla almond milk
– 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
– 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
– 1 teaspoon vanilla extract glaze:
– 3/4 cup sifted powdered sugar
– 2 tablespoons maple syrup
– 2 teaspoons maple extract
Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Mix together the milk and apple cider vinegar. Set aside.
3. Sift together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda and nutmeg in a large bowl.
4. Add the applesauce and vanilla to the soymilk mixture, and stir well.
5. Add the wet soymilk and applesauce mixture to the sifted dry mixture and stir. Do not overmix.
6. Put the batter into a plastic bag with the corner cut off to pipe it into your doughnut pan. Fill the pan to about 3/4 full in each doughnut.
7. Bake for 10-12 minutes. If you want to test it insert a toothpick and pull it out. If there are a few crumbles of cake on it or it is clean that’s fine. If it’s gooey let them bake a little longer. Let them cool in the pan for about 5 minutes and then pull them out. Let them cool for 5-10 minutes longer.
8. Sift the powdered sugar into a small bowl and stir in the maple syrup and the maple extract. You may want to add a teaspoon or so of soymilk to thin it out.
9. Once the doughnuts have cooled slightly you can dip them into the glaze. Make sure to get the excess off before flipping them right side up.

When it comes to food and drink, Argentines know what they like and they mostly stick to it.  While other international options can be found in the metropolis of Buenos Aires, it’s not like Los Angeles where you can easily find authentic cuisine from all corners of the world.  Instead of the wide variety you find in most big cities, there is a multitude of the Argentine staples, as I like to refer to them. When in B.A., you’ll never have a shortage of empañadas, pizza, parrilla, milanesa, choripan, bondiolas, ponchos, tartas, papas fritas, medialunas, alfajores, dulce de leche and, of course, ice cream.
When most people think of Argentina, however, the first thing they think of is good steak and wine. This is very true. No matter what form it is served in, all the meat I have had here has been incredible. The most traditional Argentine meal is parrilla, and when you come to Buenos Aires you will see all different types of parrilla-style restaurants, from hole-in-the wall family-run affairs to high-end  establishments. Either way, these restaurants are where you go for a big steak dinner. When you go to a parrilla, you typically order your choice of meat and the type of cut and then sides to share as a table. There are many different cuts of beef you can order, and while it comes down to personal preference it’s hard to go wrong. My favorites are bife de lomo and bife de chorizo ordered “a punto,” or medium. With these delicious steaks you cannot forget the chimichurri, a sauce made of finely-chopped parsley, minced garlic, olive oil, oregano and white vinegar.  The most common side dishes for parrilla are usually salad, papas fritas, chorizo and provoleta. Provoleta is one of the most unusual but delicious dishes. Essentially it is grilled cheese. Cooks place a block of cheese topped with herbs and sometimes pancetta and sun-dried tomatoes in a skillet and then on the grill.  It is served hot with a basket of bread that you use to scoop up the melted cheese. While it might sound basic, it is bound to get any cheese lover’s heart thumping.
Moving away from steaks but not meat options are many other favorite Argentine foods. Don’t worry about anything being spicy, the Argentines really don’t like spicy food, and it’s hard to come by. But you have a variety of other flavors in the dishes. There are milanesas, beef or chicken, cut in a large, thin slices, breaded and then baked.  They are often served “napolitano style,” with a slice of ham melted cheese and marinara sauce over top.
Then you have your most common street foods — choripan, bondiolas and ponchos.  Choripan is chorizo, a flavorful sausage that is grilled and served inside pan, a baguette. Bondiolas are served in the similar type of bread but instead of chorizo they have slices of beef.  These sandwich-like foods are often topped with chimichurri as well. Ponchos are hotdogs, just as we know them in the U.S., and are often topped with mayonnaise, chopped tomatoes and crispy potato flakes. Of these three my favorite is definitely the choripan, with extra chimichurri, please.
Empañadas are the go-to of Argentine cuisine if you want something easy, budget friendly and quick. They come in a variety of types but the most common are jamón y queso, pollo, carne and caprese. The empañadas at El Viejo Hornito, a restaurant kitty-corner from my house, have become a Sunday night fall back for me and my housemates when we aren’t in the mood to cook.  While we might be slightly biased, we think these are the best empañadas in our area because of their soft outer pastry and extremely flavorful and generously portioned filling.
If you’re not in the mood for empañadas something else you’ll also see a lot of are pizzerias.  The first time I had pizza in Argentina I was very surprised by what I got. It was unlike any pizza I’ve had in the U.S. Argentine pizzas tend to have thicker crust, less sauce, more cheese and are completely piled with toppings.  The layer of cheese is shockingly thick and typically accompanied by ham that is put over the sauce but under the cheese, shredded chicken, mushrooms and bell peppers and of course olives.  No matter what type of pizza you  order there will be a few whole, unpitted olives plopped on top.
If you’re craving something sweet you’re likely to come across something with dulce de leche. Argentines cannot get enough of dulce de leche, and they put it on everything from their medialunas (small sweet pastries that resemble croissants) for breakfast to just about every ice cream flavor, cake or cookie.  They have alfajores, two shortbread-like cookies with dulce de leche in between them that are often dipped in chocolate.  Also, just as much as Argentines love their DDL they love their ice cream. There might be as many ice cream parlors in this city as there are Starbucks in an American city. The most popular ice cream chain is Freddo, and you can find at least one in every neighborhood if not many more. The hype around ice cream is not an overreaction. The ice cream in Argentina is a hybrid of gelato and the ice cream that can be found in the U.S. It is very smooth and creamy and comes in a huge variety of chocolate, fruit and dulce de leche flavors. Yes, there is a whole DDL category.
Of course, with all of this eating you’ll need something to drink. Don’t expect water to be offered to you with your meal. That is one of the things I miss most about the U.S.  Here, you have to buy water if you want it, and that becomes a hassle. Often cheaper and more commonly offered than water are sodas or “gaseosas.”
If you want to kick it up a notch you can hardly go wrong with wine. Overall, wine is much cheaper here than in the U.S., but there is definitely a value spectrum, and you get what you pay for. When buying in the grocery stores, you can get a nice bottle of wine for anywhere between 50-80 pesos, which is roughly $5-8. Expect to pay much more at a restaurant for a nice bottle of wine, however. Aside from wine, Argentines love fernet, a liquor that is reminiscent of jager but much more herbal. It is served with coke and is one of the most popular drinks at bars.
I will miss Argentine food a lot but will be happy to be back at home surrounded by much more variety and, of course, spicy food.

What elevates a great player to superstardom is the intangibles — the things you can’t teach. They could have a great jump shot or a hot bat, but they’ll never be Michael Jordan or Babe Ruth without the qualities that made both of those athletes the best in the game. Sometimes you can identify this intangible quality as a player’s attitude, drive or strong mentality. But sometimes you can’t put your finger on what exactly it is that makes this player so important, as if his presence alone is enough to rally his team.
USC catcher Garrett Stubbs falls into the latter category of greatness. Garrett came to the plate so many times during the Lake Elsinore Regional when the game was on the line, and his coolness was reassuring. He seemed unfazed by the pressure and was so clutch throughout the entire weekend that he earned the title of Lake Elsinore Regional MVP.
Stubbs had a stellar performance behind the plate as well. There was never any doubt that Garrett could throw out a runner trying to steal second. And his pitchers never had to worry about a wild pitch or a passed ball getting by him. He won Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year for his work behind the plate.
Something about his presence at or behind the plate was so convincing in tight situations. Sure he had a great batting average and was a sparkplug on defense, but he had many other intangible qualities that made him invaluable.
Stubbs is at a slight disadvantage as he transitions into his professional baseball career. He was drafted in the eighth round of the MLB First Year Player Draft by the Houston Astros. After such a standout senior year, I can only imagine the reason he was not drafted sooner is his height. His 5’10”, 165-pound frame is considered short for professional sports, but especially for catchers, a position that requires girth. But being a catcher also requires the unteachable qualities, something Stubbs has in abundance.
Stubbs has racked up the awards this season. In addition to the ones already mentioned he was also named a first team All-American and earned ABCA/Rawlings Gold Glove honors. He is also a finalist for the Johnny Bench Award, the award given to college baseball’s best catcher. The winner will be announced on June 25, and I think Stubbs has a great chance to add another accolade to his growing collection.
Being drafted is the first step to a major league career, but it is hardly a guarantee of success. Unlike any other sport, players must first play in the minor league system before being called up to the majors, if they’re ever called up at all.
While 5’10” is certainly not an ideal height, it’s definitely not unheard of in the MLB. The MLB has seen players as short as 5’6”. When it comes down to it, Stubbs will need to rely on his special qualities to make it in the MLB. As a Houston native, I’ve been an Astros fan since birth, and now I have another reason to cheer on the ‘Stros. I look forward to the day I hear Stubbs’ name called at Minute Maid.

After just missing qualification for a Super Regional in the NCAA Tournament, eight Trojans were drafted in the Major League Baseball First Year Draft. The Trojans’ eight draft selections were the most in one draft for the program since 1999. Since the draft began in 1965, USC has seen 316 players drafted.
The first to be drafted was junior left-handed pitcher Tyler Gilbert, who was picked by the Philadelphia Phillies in the sixth round. He is the first Trojan — 11th overall — to be drafted by the Phillies since Wes Rachels in 1998.
Gilbert had the second-lowest ERA on the team. In his one year with the Trojans, Gilbert had a 5-2 record and 2.79 ERA in 67.2 innings pitched. He started six of his 22 appearances, striking out 66 batters — second most in the program. Gilbert came up big in postseason play, tallying up a save and a win. He earned the save in the 12-3 win against UC Santa Barbara and the 12-11 win against San Diego State.
Senior catcher Garrett Stubbs was drafted by the Houston Astros in the eighth round of the draft. Stubbs racked up a number of postseason honors; most notably, he is one of three finalists for the Johnny Bench Award, awarded to the nation’s top collegiate catcher. Stubbs is USC’s second finalist for the award; Jeff Clement won the award in 2005. The winner will be announced June 25th.
Stubbs also was named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year, First Team All-Pac-12 and was named catcher of the           Pac-12 All-Defensive Team. In the NCAA Regional, Stubbs led the team with a .563 batting average and caught all 38 innings in four games, earning the Lake Elsinore Regional MVP and All-Regional team honors. He also had a stellar regular season, starting 59 games. He threw out 52.8 percent of stealers, led the team with 20 stolen bases and was second on the team with a .346 batting average.
Junior left-handed pitcher Kyle Twomey was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 13th round.  He becomes the seventh Trojan drafted by the Cubs and the first since Mark Prior was drafted second overall in the 2001 draft. As the Saturday starter this season, Twomey finished with an 8-2 record in 16 starts, with 68 strikeouts in 93.2 innings. He threw the most innings and racked up a 2.88 ERA—the lowest of any starter. Additionally, he was named an All-Pac-12 honorable mention this season.
Junior right-handed pitcher Brent Wheatley was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the 17th round. Wheatley is the 17th Trojan to be drafted by the Athletics and the first since 2011 when Shane Boras was drafted in the 39th round in 2011. Wheatley started off the season as the Trojans’ Friday night ace, but eventually moved to the bullpen. He had nine starts in 17 appearances with a 4-4 record, 4.50 ERA and 63 strikeouts in 70 innings.
Senior second baseman Dante Flores was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 18th round. He is the 13th Trojan drafted by the White Sox and the third drafted in the last five years. As a four-year starter, Flores had a .304 batting average and drove in 43 runs — both third-highest on the team — in 59 games played. Flores was named an All-Pac-12 honorable mention.
Redshirt junior Bobby Stahel was drafted by the Colorado Rockies in the 20th round. He is only the third Trojan to be drafted by the Rockies. Stahel was second in the conference with a .376 batting average — 26th best average nationally. He also led the team with a .514 slugging percentage. Stahel earned First Team All-Pac-12 honors, ABCA All-West Region First Team and was a semifinalist for the Gregg Olson Award — awarded to the nation’s top breakout player.
Junior right-handed pitcher Kyle Davis was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 29th round. He is the 10th Trojan to be selected by the Blue Jays — the most recent being Bob Wheatley in 2014 in the 26th round. Davis, who was hampered by injuries this season, began in the bullpen and started the final four Friday games as the team’s ace. In his first start of the year, Davis pitched a complete game shutout against Stanford. In the Lake Elsinore Regional, Davis pitched a no-hitter through seven innings against Virginia. He had five starts in 20 games with a 3-3 record, 45 strikeouts and a 4.05 ERA in 53.1 innings.
The eighth and final Trojan drafted in 2015 was senior infielder Angelo La Bruna, who was drafted by the Washington Nationals in the 33rd round. He is the 11th Trojan drafted by the Nationals overall, with the last being pitcher Tommy Milone in the 10th round in 2008.  La Bruna started 22 games at shortstop and appeared in a total of 39 games. He had a .250 batting average. He only committed six errors all season and recorded 46 putouts. As a political science major, he was named to the Pac-12 All-Academic Second Team.
The non-seniors have a difficult decision to make, as they will have to decide between returning to USC for another season or signing a contract with their new teams.

For the first time since 2009, both the men’s and women’s track and field teams had top 10 finishes at the NCAA Track and Field Championships held in Eugene, Oregon, from June 10-13. The men’s team took fifth place and the women’s finished in seventh.
The men’s team saw success in both racing events and field events. Senior Conor McCullough destroyed the competition in the hammer throw, defeating his closest competitor by almost 17 feet. The senior earned All-American honors for his performance.
Debatably the most impressive Trojan performance of the weekend went to junior Andre De Grasse, who swept the 100m and 200m for the first time since Olympic medalist Walter Dix did it in 2007 for Florida State University.
De Grasse set a personal best with a time of 9.75. The run was spectacular and tied none other than Olympian Tyson Gay for the fastest time run at Hayward Field. De Grasse also won by a margin of .13 seconds, which is the largest margin since 2010.
De Grasse’s performance was not done there, though, as he moved on to the 200m. Becoming only the 21st person to ever win both races in the same season, he did so in historic fashion. De Grasse ran a 19.58 in the 200m which is not only the fastest time ever run by a collegiate athlete, it set the field record and is also the fastest any-conditions time for the year in the world.
In the relay event, De Grasse served as the second leg on the 4×100 relay that also featured senior BeeJay Lee, junior Just’N Thymes, and freshman Adoree’ Jackson. The team finished in fourth with a time of 38.75, the second-fastest time in school history.
Jackson, who competed in the long jump, is the first football player to also score in two events at the T&F championships since 2000.
De Grasse scored 21.5 points for the Trojans, the most by any athlete in 2015, and was the first USC athlete to lead the championship scoring since 1978. He earned 10 points each for his wins in the 100m and 200m and an additional 1.5 points for his role in the relay.
“It was just an unbelievable feeling,” De Grasse said in a press release. “I never thought that I could run that fast, but I just have to believe in myself, and now that I’ve run that fast, it’s changed my whole perspective on running.”
On the women’s side of the action, the relays were strong. The 4x100m relay team started the day with the team of freshman Dior Hall, freshman Ky Westbrook, junior Alexis Faulknor and freshman Deanna Hill. The team placed third with a time of 43.27, the second fastest time on the year for the quartet.
The final event, the 4x400m relay, vaulted the team from ninth overall in the competition to their finishing position of seventh. The women placed second in the race with a time of 3:29:97.
Tera Novy placed fourth in the discus throw for the women for the best finish in the event ever by a USC athlete.
With their two top-10 finishes, the track and field teams were able to place 24 athletes on the first-team All-American list in addition to eight second-team honorees, and four Trojans earning honorable mention. Ten members of the men’s team earned first-team honors and 14 members of the women’s, the second-highest total among the women’s teams. All-American status is based on the results at the NCAA Championships with the top eight finishers in an event earning first team status, 9-16 place earning second, and 17-24 earning honorable mention.

USC Libraries plans to debut its renovated website on July 1 in the hopes of updating old infrastructure and eliminating outdated information while optimizing user-friendliness.
Along with adding entirely new features to the USC Libraries’ website, the new design will make previously multi-variable tasks simpler by consolidating numerous usernames and passwords for different sections into a single login for multiple library services.
Hugh McHarg, associate dean for programs and planning of USC Libraries, said the consolidation would make it more user-friendly.
“One of the most significant new features that will be really useful to students is single sign-on for your library accounts. You’ll no longer need separate usernames and passwords for HOMER, interlibrary loan and other services,” McHarg said. “You’ll be able to use your USC email log-in to renew books, request interlibrary loans and take advantage of other services.”
The new layout is not entirely technical, as it introduces aesthetically-appealing site changes to help develop a better general navigation system through USC Libraries’ abundant resources.
Nathan Masters, manager of academic events and programming communication for USC Libraries, wrote on the website that the new features will make the libraries more accessible to students.
“A fresh visual design emphasizes our powerful search box — your portal to the wealth of library resources,” Masters wrote. “New features include a real-time library hours dashboard and tools to help you find and reserve our many study spaces.”
In addition to improving the website’s overall design, USC Libraries has emphasized adding useful material for students and researchers to the site, while clearing out old content and updating current features.
“If through the research and design process we learned that [current services] weren’t as accessible as they could be, we have moved them to areas of the site that make them easier to discover and, therefore, more useful and valuable to students,” McHarg said.
Beyond helping students find open study spaces, the new layout delineates specific features of these study areas: whether or not there is coffee nearby; if there are cellphone charging stations available; if there are printers, scanners and copiers available; how accessible the computers are; and which rooms are available to be reserved all fall within these new features.
With “positive student experience” at the forefront of USC Libraries’ goals, the new website layout will make the USC Libraries a premier tool for online and book research alike.
McHarg said that the primary purpose of restructuring USC Libraries’ online infrastructure is to make the library resources easier and more effective for students to use.
“[The goal] is to create the best possible digital environment for students to find and use the research materials they need to conduct their research and get their coursework done.”
The process of creating new content and databases for the reformatted website has included a multi-faceted approach to each aspect of the current website. Designers considered opinions from employees of the library as well as those of students.
“We began the process more than two years ago. It started with research, focus groups of students and faculty and assessments of the current state of research library sites,” McHarg said. “The research and preparation are really key, as the design follows from what we learned in the research phase through studying user personas, usability assessments and our annual surveys of USC students, faculty and staff.”
The ultimate goal of the website renovation project is to express to students the value of incorporating USC Libraries’ resources into the college research method.
“The libraries provide a tremendous number of resources for every school and every department on campus, and we want to make sure that our website makes it as easy as possible for you to make the best possible use of them all,” McHarg said.
Incorporating technology as a tool for website and library navigation has been an essential element of the reconstruction.
Masters encouraged students to utilize all of the improved features of the website. He also said students can access the details about the redesign on the website homepage and take a guided tour of the new features.

California residents will soon have to reduce their water usage by 25 percent, according to a plan proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown at the first meeting of “The California Conversation” series held last Tuesday at Town & Gown. The discussion was hosted by L.A. Times publisher and C.E.O., Austin Beutner.
The new plan would impose heavy taxes on citizens who use too much water during the crisis.
“You’re going to see it in your water bills,” Brown said.
The plan was proposed after several years of inadequate rainfall that forced California to deplete many of its river sites, including the Colorado River. Replacement sites have been difficult to locate.
“Most good river sites have been built,” Brown said. “[We] depend on snow melt and mother nature.”
Compounding the difficulties that California faces with the drought, Brown spoke broadly about the global warming crisis and its catastrophic effects on the world’s increasing temperature and changing currents.
“This is a crisis,” Brown said. “This is not a political problem. This is not Democrats or Republicans. This is about humans.”
California’s population over the last 50 years has boomed to the point that now 39 million people reside within the state. Brown noted this as another potential complication for the ongoing water crisis.
“We haven’t grown slowly,” Brown said. “We have not had time to reflect. We are part of a complex way of life.”
Brown urged the public to start using water wisely and more efficiently in their daily lives. At the same time, Brown noted that the government would begin implementing changes in both the residential and agricultural sectors to encourage water efficiency.
“We need as many changes as we can,” Brown said. “We need to adapt to whatever environment that we’re in.”
One of the changes that residential Californians would face in the coming years includes a conversion of grass lawns to eco-friendly ones that would lead to a 3 percent decrease in water use.
“We need to adjust humankind,” Brown said. “Animals change to be on nature’s side, and we will have to learn to do the same.”
Brown also talked about the long-term plans of his office to decrease the amount of water and pollution that California creates. Decreasing cars on the road by 50 percent and creating a 50 percent increase in renewable energy were some of the major changes he presented. Last week, state regulators announced historic cuts to farmers and others taking water from the Sacramento, San Joaquin and delta watersheds.
Technology played a large role in the discussion as Brown spoke about many of the projects that were currently underway to increase water efficiency as well as future hope for new research discoveries.
One current project is the Bay Delta Conservation Plan — a $25 billion venture that would divert water from the Sacramento River into the California Aqueduct.
This project comes in addition to the Central Valley Water Project that also diverts water from northern California in addition to providing dams and reservoirs in the southern California area.
In addition to the major projects instituted by the California state government, local water districts are also coming up with their own small-scale solutions to the water crisis. Brown suggested companies design streets around an aqueduct so rainwater would easily drain into it.
Despite acknowledging some advancements on the horizon, Brown remained pessimistic about the current state of technology in terms of the water.
“There are not a lot of new ideas right now,” he said.
In addition to speaking about the crisis, Brown also took questions the public submitted to the L.A. Times for the event. The first question came from a citizen who denounced the bullet train project as a waste of water and resources during a time of crisis. Brown stood by the project, however, claiming that it would be beneficial for the environment and create an energy-efficient means of travel.
“The roads are too crowded,” Brown said. “Trains can decrease car use.”
The second letter came from an elderly couple who believed that the new policy would create considerable strain to their already tight water budget. Brown stood by his policy as a “work in progress.”
“We can use water efficiently,” Brown said. “We’re going to stay the course and adjust if necessary.”
In his final words, Brown remained hopeful about southern California’s ability to adapt and change during the crisis.
“Water is more important than the economy. It’s more fundamental,” Brown said. “We got a lot to learn about adaptation and innovation. I’m confident we can be successful.”

Effective this fall, Student Affairs will begin covering security costs for all student events on the grounds that alleviating these costs will help campus organizations improve the quality of the experiences that they provide.
Every year, a portion of what students pay in tuition goes to student programming fees, which are used by Undergraduate Student Government special committees to host concerts, shows and other events on campus. When a student organization puts on an event, the organization is also responsible for the security fees, which include paying for DPS, LAPD and CSC, among other entities.
According to USG President Rini Sampath, this means that a large percentage of the money that organizations have in their annual budget is going directly to security costs, instead of being allocated to pay for creating better quality events and enhancing students’ experience.
Former USG president Andrew Menard and current USG president Rini Sampath met last semester with President C. L. Max Nikias to bring this concern to his attention. This past spring, Menard and Sampath discussed this issue with Vice Provost Michael Quick, who along with Ainsley Carry, vice provost for Student Affairs, approved the petition and accepted security costs into the Student Affairs budget.
“Students have complained about the quality of artists that we bring to a concert,” Sampath said. “But that’s one aspect of it … Security costs impact the quality of artists that we bring in, so the more we can take care of costs like these, the more chances we have of signing bigger artists.”
Judah Joseph, executive director of Concerts Committee, said that the security costs for Springfest this year totaled more than $16,000 dollars. Concerts Committee is also responsible for the Welcome Back Concert in August and Conquest during the fall semester. Joseph said he felt it was unnecessary for Concerts Committee to have to pay for security costs when they were already dealing with tight budgets.
“If our one event cost that much money just for security, then you can imagine what our annual security costs are,” Joseph said. “And now that those costs are alleviated from our own responsibility… that money can be much better used.”
Student Affairs officials said since their primary concern is the security of students, they will work hard to build these fees into their next year budget.
“Student safety continues to be one of our top priorities,” Monique Allard, assistant provost for Student Affairs said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Student Affairs will invest in supporting the cost of security costs this year and build those costs into a budget request for next year.”
Sampath said she was happy that the administration was so receptive to this idea.  She said that when the administration is informed of student concerns in a diplomatic way, they usually respond positively, and USG is looking forward to another year working together with Student Affairs in the hopes of improving the students’ experience at USC.
“I am especially impressed by Provost Quick’s leadership,” Sampath said. “I think that he is really ushering in a new era with how responding and how in touch he is with the students.”

On Aug. 1, 1966, former marine Charles Whitman armed himself with seven guns and more than 700 rounds of ammunition and went on a shooting spree, murdering 16 people in 90 minutes.  The Texas legislature decided this month that in August 2016, exactly 50 years after the incident, college students all over the Lone Star State will be permitted to similarly arm themselves while on campus. The state has seemingly adopted the idea that, according to State Representative Jonathan Stickland, “an armed society is a safe society.”
Yet despite this win for “Second Amendment rights,” pro-gun lobbying groups such as Students for Concealed Carry are still referring to these new laws as only a first step, and promise to finish the job in 2017. Students for Concealed Carry took particular umbrage with regulations that allowed public universities, like the UT schools, to designate particular parts of campus as gun-free zones and allow private universities to opt out entirely.
What these gun advocates do not understand about the legislative process is that compromise is necessary, especially on hot-button issues. Gun control is a heated, national debate and has been for decades. In this scenario, where the political left and right are firmly divided, even in Texas,  neither side is going to emerge with a clear victory. Moderate voters decide the majority of elections, so no state legislature will side conclusively on one side of an issue because of political retribution.
Furthermore, the Republicans in Texas who sponsored this measure have created a solution searching for a problem. There is no rash of campus violence sweeping Texas institutions of higher learning that more concealed weapons would stop. In fact, UT Chancellor Admiral William McRaven, a former Navy SEAL who commanded U.S. Special Forces during the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, has said that while he loves his guns, he does not want to bring them to colleges because guns will not make the campus safer.
McRaven has more experience in these matters than others in the debate. He’s been trained extensively to use a gun and has been shot. Most students in Texas have probably not undergone the same level of training that McRaven has as a SEAL. In a firefight, when adrenaline kicks in and heart rate increases, it becomes much harder to maintain the fine motor control necessary to safely and effectively operate a firearm. For that reason, police officers and military personnel train constantly, until muscle memory overrides human physiology. The requirements for a concealed carry permit in Texas — 21 years of age, no felony convictions and a four-hour course on gun safety — are woefully inadequate for preparing a person to handle a live shooter situation. Cops are trained to handle those situations. People with concealed weapons permits alone are not.
Texas legislators also don’t seem to understand how laws and criminality work. Representative Stickland told the New York Times, “the criminals aren’t going to obey the laws. It’s the responsible folks who we should be encouraging to protect themselves in the community they live in.” The representative is indeed correct; criminals don’t obey the law, and that’s what makes them criminals. But, arguing that “criminals won’t obey the law” is a terrible reason to oppose a law.  Just because a law will not be universally followed does not mean the law should not be put in placed and enforced to the fullest extent possible. The U.S. has laws against murder, but in 2013, there were 16,121 homicides in the U.S., 11,208 of which were from firearms, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Those murders do not mean that the U.S. should eliminate laws against murder. If Stickland is really worried that criminals are not obeying the law, he should write legislation to increase enforcement of current gun laws, rather than arm more people.
Legislators spent a good deal of time talking about personal responsibility, but “responsibility” and “college student” don’t always go hand in hand. From binge drinkers to excessive partiers to sleazy fraternities to rapists, American colleges contain pockets of irresponsible students. Introducing guns into this mix is a recipe for disaster.
Dan Morgan-Russell is a rising senior studying international relations, global economy.
Texas homicide rate (with 24/7 patrol by 826,000 CHL holders):  4.4
Texas campus homicide rate (gun-free zone):  0.14
Number of times safer it is to be on-campus than off-campus:  31
Idiots don’t know that they are idiots. You know you’re comparing state stats to campus stats don’t you?
Yes. And I’m even doing the division for you, so that you can see how much more dangerous it is in gunville than gunfreeville.
“On Aug. 1, 1966, former marine Charles Whitman armed himself with seven guns and more than 700 rounds of ammunition and went on a shooting spree, murdering 16 people in 90 minutes.”
Which begs the question: Would the laws in effect for the last four decades stop another Whitman from doing the same thing?
The answer, of course, is no, they wouldn’t.
Therefore, citing the Whitman case (and all others committed in “gun-free” zones) is meant only to incite knee-jerk, emotional, non-rational reactions from the public, because even stricter laws would not stop another lunatic from arming up and committing mayhem on a college campus.
Therefore, there is no justifiable reason for banning lawful, licensed carry of arms on campuses anywhere. “Because I don’t like it.” is not a justifiable reason.
If one wants a poster child of common core educations failure combined with illicit narcotic abuse portraying the  Hegelian Marxist fantasy of proposing failed solutions look no further than the childish uneducated immature article above…..
You neglect to mention that Charles Whitman was stopped through the efforts of other people who also had firearms on campus.  Without their help, the police would not have been able to get to him in the tower.  He is a great example of how “good guys” with guns on campus stopped a “bad guy” with a gun and prevented multiple murders.
Good point. Those guys running to get hunting rifles from the trunks of their cars saved lives, and sent a message to anyone else thinking of growing a brain tumor which might make them do something crazy.
Legislators allow guns in prisons, why should schools be any different?
Why should a free, peaceful people have arbitrary restrictions on where they may carry their possessions?
If your assertion that it takes a highly trained firearm handler to defend oneself properly was true then the wacko that just picks up a gun and starts shooting would be ineffective at killing people. There are schools all over this country that already allow guns on campus, none of the blood in the streets predictions have come true.
Did someone say “highly trained”? 
Training days for a Pastry Chef:  96
For Ringling Bros./B&B Clown College: 48
For pro Dog Walker Certificate: 4
For Concealed Gun Permit: 1
Your point is?
How is one day of training sufficient for someone who wants the authority to use deadly force? Clowns get 48 days’ training, and only carry seltzer water. Is my point.
How much training is required to be a wacko shooting up a place?
For a disproportionate number, it’s the same as for a CHL. That’s because so many spree shooters have actually been concealed carriers themselves.
Okay, you’re an idiot. You have no idea what you’re talking about.
A 2014 FBI report detailing 160 “active shooter” incidents found just one stopped by a citizen concealed carrier, but 16 of the shooters they list turn out to have been concealed carriers themselves. Adding 20 more incidents which gun guru John Lott insisted should be included, there are at least 18 concealed carriers among 143 age 21-and-over active shooters. That is 4 times the average prevalence of concealed carriers in the general population during the sample period (2000 – 2013). Concealed weapon licensure appears to be a significant risk factor for becoming an active/mass shooter.
There. Now you attempt to apply a false denominator: “b-b-b-but that’s out of 11 million law-abidin’ God-fearin’ freedom lovin’ patriotic snakey-flag-worshipin’ mostly older male white folk!!”
Tell us how often someone with a license to carry goes rogue. Authority to use deadly force does not apply only to those that are armed.
Quite a number of problems, misconceptions, ignorance, lack of info, etc., here.
(1) Armed citizens helped keep Whitman boxed in and limited his lanes of fire.
(2) “What these gun advocates do not understand about the legislative process is that compromise is necessary” – that all depends.  King Solomon comes to mind.
(3) “Furthermore, the Republicans in Texas who sponsored this measure have created a solution searching for a problem. There is no rash of campus violence sweeping Texas institutions of higher learning that more concealed weapons would stop.”  One would think one Virginia Tech would be enough.
(4) “In a firefight, when adrenaline kicks in and heart rate increases, it becomes much harder to maintain the fine motor control necessary to safely and effectively operate a firearm.”  Which is why one should to what, exactly, when you’re being fired upon and you don’t have a gun?
(5) “For that reason, police officers … train constantly, until muscle memory overrides human physiology.”  Utterly and completely false.
(6) “Texas legislators also don’t seem to understand how laws and criminality work.”  They are ahead of you, and by a long shot.  The point is, someone bent on murder is not going to be deterred by a law that says, “no guns allowed at the place you intend to murder people.”  “Arguing that “criminals won’t obey the law” is a terrible reason to oppose a law” – not if “the law” means leaving people defenseless at the mercy of a deranged gunman who is not deterred by the law.  “Those murders do not mean that the U.S. should eliminate laws against murder.”  Which is why no one is suggesting that.  What it does mean is that we prosecute those who murder – that is an effective, suppressive deterrent – a “gun free zone” is not.  That is the difference, and it is very, very simple.

On June 11, 2015, the real race of Rachel Dolezal, president of the Spokane, Washington, chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was exposed. The civil rights leader’s parents revealed that Dolezal has disguised herself as a black woman for 20 years, when in reality she was born Caucasian. The shocking revelation of Dolezal’s racial identity has sparked many debates. Did Dolezal pretend to be black so she would be more accepted and respected as a civil rights leader? Did she change her identity because she felt like the African American community was where she belonged?  Or does she have mental issues?
In addition to teaching as an adjunct professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington University, Dolezal has also advocated for equal rights and community development in Mississippi.  She had been carrying out social justice and advocacy work with a fake racial identity until very recently, however. Dolezal resigned from her NAACP position on June 15 due to allegations of misrepresentation of her race. She also stated in an interview on the Today show that she “identif[ies] as black.”
Rumors regarding Dolezal’s racial background have been around for some time, but a recently reported hate crime incited serious questions about Dolezal’s standing. Dolezal reported to have received a package with racist messages and death threats in the NAACP’s post office box. The postal workers reported that the package was neither time-stamped nor canceled, which raised suspicion of how the package was delivered. In response, Dolezal said she would never fabricate threat letters.
Dolezal’s father, Larry, explained to the press that Dolezal cut off communication with him and her mother a long time ago, not wanting them “visible in the Spokane area in her circle because [they] are Caucasian.” Furthermore,  Dolezal called Albert Wilkerson, a black male human rights volunteer, her father. In a picture posted on Spokane NAACP’s Facebook page, Wilkerson appears next to Dolezal, with the caption identifying Wilkerson as “President Dolezal’s father.”
Whether or not it’s understandable to fake one’s own race in order to connect with another race is up for debate; however, it would be fair to suggest that the world is becoming more open-minded to condone an activist’s work for people of different racial backgrounds, if the activist truly cares for their well-being. Moreover, a number of other white or half-white activists, such as Tricia Rose and Melissa Harris, have contributed to the empowerment of the black community without concealing their true ethnicity.
Honesty and integrity are two of the most important traits of a leader, and Dolezal has clearly failed to act upon them. It is difficult to follow a leader who lies about his or her true identity in an attempt to gain followers. Even though Dolezal’s contribution as an activist is considerable, her identity crisis puts years of her work in question. Some have gone as far to suggest that Dolezal has “Histrionic Personality Disorder,” in which subjects dramatically change their appearance and over-exaggerate their emotions to gain attention.
Dolezal’s fake identity not only makes her less trustworthy as a leader, but it can also potentially offend members of the African-American community. Race is a serious matter deeply connected to history and culture. To disguise oneself as a member of another race can be seen as putting on an ethnic costume without considering its historical and cultural implications.
Even so, Dolezal’s supporters continue to argue in her defense. One of her supporters asked on a social networking site that if Caitlyn Jenner can decide that she is a woman, why can’t Dolezal decide she is black? Well, she technically can, but the argument fails to acknowledge the legal way to change one’s ethnicity by submitting forms and waiting for approval by the law. One cannot simply “decide” to present oneself as black, especially while working for a cause as sensitive as civil rights. In the end, it’s all about what we can do for the community as a whole.

Good article, Khyati. To me and many others, Dolezal is a fake, a phony a fraud. Was her deception well-intended? Maybe. But even so, I can only feel pity for her and the psychological problems that compelled her to commit this bizarre imitation.
