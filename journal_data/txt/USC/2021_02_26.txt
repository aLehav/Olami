During a power outage near Dallas, Texas, Kaitelyn Haynes, a sophomore majoring in architecture, sat in her dark room, holding up a flashlight while doing her physics homework due later that week. Overwhelmed by freezing temperatures and inconsistent power, Haynes and many other students struggled to keep up with classwork while overcoming Winter Storm Uri.  
Beginning Feb. 13, Texas battled a winter storm that caused power outages, water shortages and over a dozen Texan deaths out of around 70 deaths caused by a storm that affected the entire nation. 
After about three days of on-and-off power, students are now dealing with catching up in school. Weather conditions have gotten better, with highs reaching the upper 70s compared to the 20-30 degree Fahrenheit weather that persisted throughout the third week of February. 
“We have power, heating, everything. We’re not really using the heat right now because the weather’s perfect, but a week ago, everything was completely different,” said Haynes, who lives in Los Angeles but had visited her family in Texas Feb. 15. “[If you went] outside, there was at least like two inches of snow everywhere. Wednesday was when [the power] was going off … every 45 minutes. Power would be on, power would be off. And that night is also when we lost water.” 
LeeAnna Villarreal, a sophomore majoring in journalism, also experienced these problems in Houston. Relying on a generator to power up only a couple of lights and heaters, Villarreal said she wore three layers of clothing in her house.
“It’s just so crazy that the freeze lasted for a couple of days and that even [on] the second day there was still snow.” Villarreal, who has lived in Texas her whole life, said. “That was really surprising … I think the inside of my house was maybe like [in] the 50s or 40s.”
Due to global warming, cold air — called the polar vortex — that usually circulated exclusively to the North Pole area has traveled south. Increased temperatures in the Arctic have weakened the jet streams, or winds, causing the sudden cold temperatures in the United States, according to CBS News.
According to The Guardian, high demand for electricity caused the power outages that almost caused the entire Texas power grid to fail. The winter storm hit Texas harder than the rest of the U.S. because its independent grid system prevents it from buying power from other states. 
Discrepancies of experiences also arose within Texas. According to USA Today, families of color in lower-income areas often do not have access to resources such as a car, funds for groceries or the ability to repair busted pipes quickly. In effect, these neighborhoods were hit the hardest and will take longer to recover from the storm. 
“I know people posting from Dallas [are saying] the low income neighborhoods did not have power the longest, but yet the higher income neighborhoods had power and were doing fine,” Villarreal said. “I just know there’s just a lot of frustration within my community.”
In addition to trying to remain safe, students like Haynes and Villareal have found it difficult to attend classes due to the power outages. Haynes said she had to choose which classes to skip and switch between all her devices to distribute her battery usage. Despite her situation, some of her professors have not accommodated her needs. 
“None of the professors were like, ‘Oh, reach out to me if you’re in Texas’… I just assumed if I’m in [this] situation I should tell my professor,” Haynes said. “It’s not like they’re going to change the curriculum to catch me up, so I just knew that it would be better to just tough it out and go to class [with] horrible [internet] connection than have to miss the class completely.”
Villarreal also said that, while professors have been understanding of the situation and allowing students to miss class, they still expected students to catch up soon.
“It was much worse after everything because I realized I have all this stuff I need to do, but during the storm I was kind of like, ‘There’s nothing I can do about it. I just have to figure it out when everything’s back to normal,’ but I think [my mental state] was definitely a lot worse right now and over the weekend, just like so much stress on me to get back to speed,” Villarreal said. 
However, sophomore Giulia Orsenigo, who is located in Houston, said her professors allowed her to have extensions on classwork. 
“All my professors [said], ‘Don’t worry, staying warm and being safe is more important right now,’ so they’re all really great, and they all gave me extensions on my assignments,” Orsenigo said.
Orsenigo, who is majoring in journalism and screenwriting, said she could not attend classes, not only because of the power outage, but also because she had to drive around in search of food. Food banks witnessed a surge in Texans who were in need of food and water following the freezing temperatures, according to The Guardian. 
“All our food spoiled so we were driving around trying to find somewhere to eat,” Orsenigo said. “We were in a Burger King line for three hours.” 
She said that staying optimistic was the hardest part of the situation, hearing that two million people were freezing in their homes. 
“I also kept thinking how fragile our whole structure of society is … it was honestly kind of apocalyptic going out there and like seeing all the lines at the fast food [restaurants] and everything was empty and closed,” Orsenigo said. “This is such a fragile structure that we have built our society on and I feel like climate change, which is kind of one of the reasons why this happened, [COVID-19], and everything, it’s just kind of brought to light how fragile it all is.”

Following the insurrection of the United States Capitol Jan. 6, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger delivered a speech denouncing then President Donald Trump and his Republican participants. Days later, Schwarzenegger said that day shattered U.S. ideals. 
The Trojan Democrats and College Republicans at USC (USC GOP) hosted a joint Zoom event Tuesday, moderated by a representative from both parties alongside Schwarzenegger, Chairman of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, to promote bipartisan unity and find common ground to move forward as a country. 
The “Common Ground” event, initiated by the Trojan Democrats after seeing Schwarzenegger’s speech, was put on to discuss unity of the country coming out of a period of incredible divisiveness, said Lee Schlosser, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and economics and international relations and the communication director of the Trojan Democrats. 
“We have our differences with the USC GOP and a lot of our priorities are different,” Schlosser said. “A lot of our policies are different, but at the end of the day, we’re still Americans. I don’t think anyone on either side wants to see more things like the insurrection happen again. It’s important that we see each other as brothers and sisters rather than political enemies.”
The Trojan Democrats and the USC GOP are two of the largest political parties on campus that work to promote the message of their respective parties. Aside from debates they both participate in each semester, the “Common Ground” event, which was held Feb. 23, was the first major event they collaborated on, as well as Schwarzenegger’s first public event since his virtual speech on Jan. 10.
“It has been such a polarizing four years, not even just these past few months, [with] Donald Trump not willing to give a peaceful transfer of power,” said Sydney Ross, a junior majoring in political science and vice president of the Trojan Democrats. “I think it’s been really prevalent on USC’s campus. I know a lot of students feel that way and I think we have to realize the Republican Party, although it may be changing, isn’t going anywhere. Therefore, if we want things to get done, we need to work with them and create common ground so that we can push forward really important issues that require bipartisan leadership.”
Ross said the goal of the event was to respectfully start a conversation about unity, bipartisan leadership, common objectives and depolarizing political affiliations on campus. 
Fran Pavley, the environmental policy director of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute, said she hopes this is the beginning of a discussion, rather than a one time event. 
“Governor Schwarzenegger particularly has always looked for bipartisan solutions to solving common problems in society,” Pavley said. “Things today are a lot more partisan than I ever remember growing up. I think this next generation in particular can really lead the way to a better, healthier and happier future.”
Pavley introduced Schwarzenegger talking about his unlikely rise to power as a Republican bodybuilder and actor in California, who went on to win the state over with his bipartisan environmental policies.
“I quickly realized that I had to be bipartisan in order to run and be effective as a governor,” Schwarzenegger said. “As a Republican governor, I have to talk to and serve both Republicans and Democrats.”
Schwarzenegger said that an important factor in his campaign was that he did not see the opposing party as an enemy, but as a supportive role to work with. He recalled the need for collaboration between Republicans and Democrats when passing important bills such as the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which was AB 32 at the time, and the After School Safety Act, which was Prop 49.
“My heart is with fixing problems and making California and [the United States] better, rather than just worrying about the parties,” Schwarzenegger said. “Even though I’m a Republican and believe in the Republican principles, I realized that we had to work together, and I knew this is the way to go and make people happy in California so they feel that I’m representing all of them.”
According to Schwarzenegger, laws that are passed with the support of both parties are more likely to be passed than when a singular party tries to implement an order. He encouraged the students involved with Trojan Democrats and USC GOP to find common goals and work towards innovative solutions to make the community better together.
“The problem that we have in [the United States] is that we exclude the other side as if with 50% of the brain power, you can win anything,” Schwarzenegger said. “Can you imagine that the Lakers go out and say they’re only going to play half of their players? They’re going to lose, lose, lose and lose. That is why we are falling behind in the United States … The only way we can make progress is by working together. Don’t think of someone who doesn’t think like you as the enemy.”
Schwarzenegger said that in regards to the events of the Jan. 6 insurrection, the people responsible should be held accountable, but the rest of the Republican party should not be villainized, and as a country we should try to find a way to work together and move forward.
“I feel that if the president succeeds, Americans are succeeding,” said Molly Davis, a sophomore majoring in public relations and the vice chair of the USC GOP, who was also co-moderating the event. “No matter the outcome of the election party-wise, I feel that it is important to wish our new administration success in the endeavors and in passing legislation that’s positive for the country.”
Following Schwartzenegger’s speech about unity and common ground between the parties, Davis and Sydney Brown, a sophomore majoring in political science, began co-moderating a Q&A session to get his opinion on the insurrection and unity of the country.
Schwarzenegger gave an anecdote about two students from USC who had gone before the Los Angeles City Council to present a case to have a 10-year-old ban of murals overturned and succeeded. He encouraged students to work together to have an impact on the community.
“The left and the right keep talking and talking, but they don’t create action — the action is in the middle,” Schwarzenegger said. “When the left and the right come together, that’s when they can create action and compromise.”

In response to the Black Lives Matter protests last summer following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the pandemic disproportionately affecting communities based on their race and economic status, and voter disenfranchisement leading up to the election, Camille Gear Rich wrote a memo proposing a mandatory “Race, Racism and the Law” course at the USC Gould School of Law.
Rich, a Gould professor of Law and Sociology, said she felt students would benefit from a better understanding of historical conversations about race and the law, and an opportunity to consider the contemporary effects of exclusion and marginalization. 
“Lawyers have a great deal of responsibility in structuring fair and honest arrangements in society,” Rich said. “When we decline to provide students with an opportunity to talk about race, they can develop a tunnel vision that makes them unable to properly serve their clients and, more broadly, to serve the cause of justice.”
Following phone calls with faculty, more drafts of the memo, and many subcommittee meetings, the course is expected to launch next spring and will be mandatory for all students, beginning with the Class of 2024. 
“My colleagues and I believe that the law school has an obligation to do more for our students in terms of preparing them for the legal world, in which they may encounter issues of race and racism that affect their ability to practice law and also affect the lives of their clients,” said Vice Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs Franita Tolson, one of the chairpersons of the subcommittee that developed the course.
Tolson said that she hopes this course will allow law students to confront issues about race and the law openly. While the law school already offers courses on race such as “Racial Ambiguity Blues” and “Critical Race Theory,” the “Race, Racism and the Law” course is the first to be offered as a requirement for graduation. Additionally, Tolson said the “Race, Racism and the Law” course takes a broader survey approach, as opposed to the specific and specialized courses offered in the past. The course will be offered for the first time in Spring 2022.
“We think it’s important for our students to understand all dimensions of racial issues, as opposed to just a specialized focus offered in some of the courses that we have in our curriculum now,” Tolson said.
According to Tolson, student involvement was key in the creation of this course. Martina Fouquet, a second-year law student and the student representative on the subcommittee tasked with establishing the “Race, Racism and the Law” course, was able to speak with her peers and colleagues and gather a sense of support among the student body. 
“A lot of law students can graduate law school with no context whatsoever as to how race and racism affects the application of law,” Fouquet said. “The course is used as a way to ensure that, on top of our doctrinal courses that we are all getting, we are also getting substantive knowledge and understanding of how race and racism affect the application of the law.”
Fouquet said she believes much of the law school curriculum involves courses on passing the bar exam. She hopes the “Race, Racism and the Law” requirement will lead students to apply the law in a way that will lead to adequate addressing of racial issues, regardless of the industry or practice law students go into.
“It’s sometimes unfortunate that while we might be prepared to pass the bar [exam], we might not be fully informed of how to really affect change in our societies, which I think is one of the biggest motivations for people coming to law school,” Fouquet said.
With USC Gould being the first Top 25 law school in the country to implement a requirement of this sort, Rich said she believes the course will attract and inspire students committed to racial justice and fairness and share an understanding of the consequences racism has had for the structure of American democracy.
“We felt that this foundational, cohesive course really provides an opportunity to compare the treatment of different racial groups across time and would really be a signature part of the USC education and a sign of our commitment to intelligently, meaningfully and rigorously discussing topics of race in the years to come,” Rich said.
As a trailblazer on implementing the race and law course requirement, Tolson said she hopes other schools follow suit and that the course normalizes discussions about race as a society.
“I think we have so much potential to do so many great things,” Tolson said. “It reflects well on this University where we are relative to our peers. We’re taking a leading role in this, influencing other schools to follow suit. We’ve heard from a number of other institutions who are also looking at instituting this type of class, and so it feels really, really good to be a trailblazer on this because it’s a really important issue.”

After a summer of protests and discussions about policing in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, the election of Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón — who campaigned as one of the country’s most progressive district attorneys — was a major victory for activists. Gascón promised significant changes to the criminal justice system, including the end of the death penalty in LA, the end of charging children as adults and the end of sentencing enhancements. But during his first few months in office, his policies received significant pushback, primarily from law enforcement officials and prosecutors.
However, various stakeholders, including DA Gascón, USC Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas and Skipp Townsend — the founder of the activist organization 2nd Call— came together in a Zoom panel to discuss a path forward Wednesday. The panel was hosted by the USC Executive Master of Leadership program, the USC Price Safe Communities Institute and the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association, and was moderated by Executive Master of Leadership Program Director Carol J. Geffner. 
Erroll Southers, the Director of the Safe Communities Institute, introduced the speakers, setting the tone for the discussion by quoting North Carolina Sheriff Hubert Peterkin, who said that law enforcement needs to say six words: “We are part of the problem.”
Thomas, who grew up in South L.A. and patrolled those same streets as an officer, echoed that sentiment, citing law enforcement’s history as slave patrols and enforcers of Black codes and Jim Crow laws. 
“All of those things that were designed to ensure that Black people ‘knew their place’ in American society were enforced by law enforcement,” Thomas said. “We have to own that. I’ve been in this profession 36 years, we have to own that legacy and we have to train to [address] it. Officers should be hired based upon awareness of these sensitivities and these cultural sensitivities.”
Gascón, a former police officer himself, spoke about his journey from part of the system to a force working to change it. 
“I readily admit that I was part of the system … I embraced a culture,” Gascón said. “What became very obvious to me as I grew up in the organization was that so much of what we were doing really wasn’t providing any more safety. To the contrary, I think it was creating more insecurity; it was certainly enhancing the racism that is embedded into the system, in that we  were socially and economically destroying our communities.”
Gascón said he realized that the system is not broken, but is working the way it was intended to when it was first designed. Reform, therefore, is inadequate, according to Gascón — during his campaign, he created initiatives to restructure and reimagine the system, including ending sentencing kids as adults, stopping sentence enhancements and removing the death penalty.
“The death penalty doesn’t work,” Gascon said. “It doesn’t work socially, economically and it certainly doesn’t provide any improvement for our community safety. But we do know that it [has] a very racist application, especially in L.A. County, [and] throughout the nation.”
When elected, Gascón immediately implemented the changes he campaigned on — and then received immediate pushback. The pushback, he said, is driven by underlying racism, economic interests and political power.
“We know that law enforcement, especially police unions, and, you know, prosecutors, unions, have for years, exerted a disproportionate amount of political influence in our legislative and our political system,” Gascon said. “We basically wanted to break away from that mold and really start hitting in a different direction.” 
Townsend spoke about how, in his activism, he’s seen people fight against movements that aim to get people home from jails and prisons because of fear. Those are the people fighting Gascón’s reforms, he said.
“There’s a fear of that individual coming home — not knowing where their mentality is, where their mindset is,” Townsend said.
Thomas also stressed that, while police need to change, every solution cannot be dropped at the foot of law enforcement. 
“Unless these other institutions are dealt with and actually reformed as well, it’s still not addressing the conditions in these communities,” Thomas said. “At the end, we’re still talking about a broken healthcare system, a broken educational system. We still haven’t dealt with community trauma, which is the root of a lot of the criminality that goes on.”
Hannah Findling, a master’s student studying public administration who attended the event, said that she was grateful for the event and hopes to see more discussions like this. 
“I think it’s really easy for those with privilege in our society, myself included, to be ignorant of so much of what happens around us,” Findling said. “And the publicity and emotion and everything that resulted from the death of George Floyd made it a topic that everyone needed to talk about … Social media has been a really powerful tool in raising awareness, but I think these more in depth discussions with community members are what really starts to lead to change.”

Musician, composer, artist and activist Jon Batiste brought his infectious joy, soulful voice and bright, playful energy when he joined the °1824 team of Universal Music Group for a virtual press conference Tuesday.
Attendees asked questions and heard the Louisiana native share stories of his creative process, general thoughts on music’s impact and how his musical upbringing informs his art. With each question, Batiste’s passionate sense of joy echoed as he proceeded to break out into song, to improvise on the grand piano he was sitting at or to blow into his piano flute.
Batiste has done everything from recording an entire album on New York City subway trains to composing Disney’s “Soul” soundtrack to musically directing “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” Now, he’s coming out with a new album “WE ARE” on March 19. 
When asked to describe the album, Batiste points out that, unlike his past work, “WE ARE” — which molds soul, jazz, R&B, rap and gospel together — is a “genreless … Black pop masterpiece.” 
The album doesn’t let genres and labels get in its way as it takes you on an emotional journey.
In its electrifying, gospel-inspired debut single “I Need You,” Batiste’s joyful rapping, high notes and instrumental breaks make you want to get up and dance, while “Cry,” the album’s second single, brings in a more somber tone that leads listeners to reflect on the ways they cope with hardship.
“It’s a novel,” Batiste said about his forthcoming album. “And if you close your eyes, it’s a movie.”
As for what got him into music in the first place, Batiste credits a lot of stuff, including his home city of New Orleans, his family (“The first step was really my dad being there and playing bass at the house”) and ever-changing environments.
“I was in a musical environment,” Batiste said. “I grew up in New Orleans, my father is a musician, I have uncles and cousins that are musicians and [New Orleans] is a very musical city. It’s a hub of Black culture and world culture colliding in ways that are influential and inspiring.” 
At 17, Batiste moved to New York and attended The Juilliard School, where he received both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in music and further expanded his musicality.
However, Batiste said he “never was someone who thought ‘I’m going to go and be a musician.’” 
“I always followed my curiosity,” Batiste said. “I was just pursuing things that inspired me and it kept leading me down the path to New Orleans to New York to putting my band together to touring around the world to being on TV and it just continued to build on itself.” 
Batiste also touched on the immense power and communal quality that music has that lets it spark emotion and empower people to advocate for social change.
“Music changes the way people’s emotions and thoughts happen,” Batiste said. “It makes it feel communal, when there’s music at barbeques, worship services, funerals. Music has always been a social glue — if you get people together and make them feel the same emotion at the same time, it’s a lot easier to have nuanced emotion and dialogue.” 
The artist proceeded to discuss the sensitivity creatives possess when working in their respective environments. No matter what is happening, Batiste said he manages to take in all his surroundings and lets them mold or shape his art. 
“There’s almost no choice in how the environment seeps into the work,” Batiste said. “If I’m writing something or if playing somewhere, the place that I’m in and the people that are there … the history of the place I’m in, the mic that I’m singing into, the instrument that I’m using or the shoes that I’m dancing in or whatever it is — it all goes into the work.” 
Born into a lineage of Black Louisiana musicians, Batiste continued to speak on the different ways that not just his environment and upbringing affected his work but also his Black identity. He candidly described how it has both helped and hurt his career and creative process and urged that, as a country, we need to undergo a “great unlearning” to properly acknowledge Black culture and creativity. 
“I’ve had both the good fortune of being born into a lineage of Black culture and being a leader in Black culture that has given me the opportunity to forward it and spread it and innovate,” Batiste said. “Then, I’ve also dealt with the stereotypical nature of  being viewed as a Black performer and put into a box based on someone else’s ignorance.”
“WE ARE” infuses all these experiences and stories into an eclectic, philosophical musical work that both toys with the concept of “genres” and causes listeners to reflect on their condition. It doesn’t have all the answers, but as Batiste points out, it will surely get you thinking. 
“A lot of times, we wait and we look around for the answer and we are,” Batiste said. “We look around for someone to save us, for someone to understand who we are. I look around at the times we’re in and that’s the question and that’s the answer. We are? We are. That’s it.” The album WE ARE will be out March 19 through Verve.

If you are looking for the perfect February anthem, look no further: released right in time for Black History Month and Valentine’s Day, “Brown Skin Brown Liquor” by Ronnie Quest, a senior majoring in music industry, is a romantic, R&B song that has garnered over 12,000 listens on Spotify, and 20,000 across all platforms in just two weeks. 
After having the phrase “brown skin brown liquor” stuck in his head, Quest built upon a beat created by his producer Natty Clxssic, a senior majoring in music composition at the University of California, Los Angeles, to produce the ultimate romantic, late-night anthem.
“You’re kind of supposed to feel like drunk [while listening to it],” Quest said. “Like you’re with somebody that you like and it’s a late night and you’re driving around downtown L.A.”
“Brown Skin Brown Liquor” was not Quest’s first music release. Quest has been releasing beats on SoundCloud since high school when he would make remixes and beats with his friends, such as “Let Me Get Your Email,” inspired by the high school boys’ attempts to get girls’ email. In collaboration with fellow musician and friend Dejohn Crosse, Quest also released the hip hop and rap song “Without Further Ado” during high school.
In Quest’s junior year of high school, a competing school made a diss track about his school, to which Quest and his friends responded with a diss track of their own.
“My friends [and I] remixed Drake’s ‘Back to Back’ making it ‘Gonna Beat Them Back to Back’ and we dropped that on SoundCloud,” Quest said. “It got like 5000 plays in one night and we thought we were the biggest thing on Earth.”
Quest’s musical upbringing goes back to his early years. His cultural and familial background was a great influence on his musical tastes. Quest’s father was in a rock band, and his mother played the piano. His mother’s Jamaican roots also led him to appreciate dancehall, reggae and Afrobeats. His friend’s older cousin, Baffour, also introduced him to a variety of African music from a very young age. Even Quest’s barber, one of the first people to ever believe in Quest’s musical aspirations, used to be a concert promoter in the industry. As such, Quest grew up in a highly musical environment, constantly surrounded by all different types of music.
“I was listening to everything. I was listening to jazz one day, heavy metal the next, Latin jazz and then disco the next day,” Quest said.
All of the different sounds he was exposed to laid a foundation for him to be interested in all different types of music, Quest said. It opened him up to sounds beyond what was available on the radio and gave him a more global perspective on music. In addition to all the different sounds Quest was exposed to, he took guitar, trumpet, percussion and piano lessons in his childhood, giving him a more solid musical education and foundation.
When Quest was in middle school, he discovered one of his first musical influences: Soulja Boy. After seeing Soulja Boy drop out of school at 16 and make millions off a song, a 12-year-old Quest realized he wanted to pursue that same goal with his music career.
“So my brain was like, ‘Alright, I’m going to learn how to make beats,’” Quest said. “‘I’m 12 now, that gives me four, five years to get my shit together so I can make a viral single, become a millionaire and drop out when I’m 16.’”
Quest also admired many other famous musicians and bands, such as Guns and Roses, Lil Wayne, Vybz Kartel and Dom Kennedy, for how they were able to communicate feelings and moods musically, which is what Quest himself aspires to accomplish today with his music as well.
“On a more elementary level, it’s really just about making you feel something,” Quest said.
Quest credits the Thornton School of Music, as where his immersion in music really took off. In his sophomore year, Quest was roommates with another musician, Pure Luxury. During that time, Pure Luxury was releasing music and blowing up as an artist. Quest and his other roommate Rod Henley, a senior majoring in business with a minor in music industry, stepped in to help manage and do public relations for Pure Luxury, which allowed Quest to apply the theories he learned in lectures to real-life situations.
“A music law class is all theoretical, unless you’re actually reading a contract,” Quest said. “Because my roommate at the time was just going crazy and blowing up, I was reading actual contracts. And I would walk back into my dorm from class like, ‘Oh shit, we’re doing this and this wrong, we should be doing it this way.’”
Being around Thornton students playing music and finding success in their art was a huge inspiration for Quest, and it drove him to explore his own musical ambitions.
“We’d always be working and bouncing off each other’s ideas and freestyling it in Cardinal Gardens and just having people come over and playing beats,” Henley said. “It was just kind of like this little music hub.” 
Quest’s experience managing public relations for Pure Luxury gave him a taste of real music industry work and gave him a special advantage as a new artist. From writing incredible lyrics and hooks to sending press releases to media outlets to promote his music, Quest’s knowledge about the music industry as a whole makes him a bit of a triple threat: writing, singing and marketing.
At USC, Quest was involved in many aspects of the music scene. He DJ-ed for GearFest — an annual musical event thrown by the Black Student Association — helped set up audio equipment for various events and performed at a few open mics around campus. 
However, his biggest claims to fame were the annual Thriller parties he threw off USC campus with Henley for two years. Quest and Henley would advertise the party to USC students as well as students from all over the L.A. area, including UCLA, Chapman University, Loyola Marymount University and California State University, Northridge. Each time, around 1,000 students attended, and Henley said he remembers these Thriller parties as some of his favorite memories with Quest.
In a seventh grade martial arts class, Quest met the person who would become his producer: Natty Clxssic. Clxssic grew up classically trained in piano before he started to create his own beats and instrumentals. After crossing paths with Quest going into college, Clxssic and Quest started an incredible working relationship and friendship.
“I saw that [Quest] had kind of an interesting sound, and he was someone I just wanted to work with,” Clxssic said. “I ended up reaching out, and we started this really good kind of working music duo.”
Quest and Clxssic are able to build off of each other’s creative talents and abilities, with Clxssic having an incredible ear for overall sound and Quest being able to freestyle “catchy melodies and hooks on the spot.” When the pair are in the studio together, the creative energy flows naturally, making it easy for the two to produce music.
“When I produce with [Quest], he usually gets some sort of creative energy out of me that comes from him,” Clxssic said. “I think we have mutual respect for each other as musicians, and he respects my decisions to the point where I have creativity or freedom as an artist, which I really appreciate. And I think I expect the same of him.” 
With their recent release, “Brown Skin Brown Liquor,” both Clxssic and Quest hope the songcan be a “February anthem,” relevant for both Valentine’s Day and Black History Month. Quest has plans to release a new R&B track in the next month titled “Independent,” which will only be one song in a tight line of releases planned out for the rest of the year with songs scheduled to release once a month. Quest even has plans to make the switch from R&B songs to more “dancehall summer vibes” he said.
“We have some exciting stuff coming out, especially for spring and summer,” Clxssic said. “Start looking out for more like Afrobeat kind of music, which is a whole other style of music that we haven’t really released yet.” 
Beyond “Brown Skin Brown Liquor,” Quest and Clxssic have plans to continue their working relationship and continue growing as artists together. Quest said he hopes to one day be able to support himself with his music, as well as to “create something that’s meaningful to people.” His ultimate goal is to accumulate a platform large enough to allow him to give back to his community. 
“If I could use [music] to change something and bring people together for a positive cause, I think that’s like the final end goal,” Quest said.

When it comes to food and trying new dishes, there is no place like Los Angeles — from tacos to udon to fried chicken, there is something to satisfy everyone’s cravings. With most restaurants offering takeout and delivery services, eating out and exploring the culinary scene has become easier than ever. 
Black History Month started as a way to celebrate and honor the accomplishments of African Americans whose history was not taught in school curriculum. To continue supporting Black businesses and celebrating Black culture beyond the month of February, here are a few Black-owned L.A. eateries for your consideration. 
Poppy + Rose
If there is one food L.A. takes seriously, it’s brunch, and at Poppy + Rose, there is no way you can go wrong no matter what you choose from the menu. A California-inspired American brunch restaurant, its accolades include ‘best breakfast in LA,’ ‘best chicken & waffles in LA’ and ‘best chicken sandwich in LA,’ among others.
I can personally vouch for its buttermilk fried chicken and waffle served with smoked honey butter and chives. The dish also surprisingly travels well during delivery. The fried chicken is juicy and crispy with a perfect texture that goes really well with the waffle. Having had the same dish at other L.A. brunch establishments, I can say this iteration of the dish is exceptional and is the perfect way to begin your day. 
To accompany the dish, I ordered a buttermilk biscuit and house chicken sausage. The house-made biscuit was everything a biscuit should be: crunchy and buttery with a texture that melts in your mouth. I couldn’t get enough of it and instantly devoured the entire thing. The chicken sausage, on the other hand, was not a highlight of the meal. It was a decent chicken sausage, but compared to the other dishes, did not hit the mark. 
Poppy + Rose is currently available for curbside pickup and delivery via Uber Eats, Postmates and ChowNow. 
ComfortLA
ComfortLA started as a late night, pop-up restaurant and distinguishes itself as “a clean approach to soul food.” The restaurant does so by serving southern cuisine through locally sourced, fresh, organic ingredients and healthy cooking methods. If you’re looking for comforting but healthy food, this is the place for you. 
I ordered the Dinner Special, which comes with five “Not Your Average Organic Fried Chicken Wings,” a piece of cornbread and a choice of two sides — I got mac and cheese and beans and rice. The chicken can also be modified according to your preferences. I got mine extra crispy with all drums. I also ordered the “Sweet Goodness,” a cornbread cake served with fresh strawberries. 
The cornbread was a bit dry and charred on the bottom, but was still firm and crumbly. The fried chicken was extra crispy — just as I had hoped — although a little dry, which might have been due to the delivery time. Still, they were delicious, especially with the sweet and spicy sauce that accompanied them. 
The sides were similarly good. ComfortLA’s mac and cheese might be a little light on the cheesy and creamy side, but it was still delicious and the first thing I finished on my plate. Their beans and rice were a little too smokey for my taste, but its flavors were still solid and rounded out the rest of the meal nicely. 
My favorite part of the meal was dessert: The strawberries were fresh and sweet and went very well with ComfortLA’s moist and crumbly cornbread cake, which was drizzled in a syrup that brought the entire dish together. The Dinner Special is very filling, and I had leftovers for the next day. 
Make sure you try their sauce with the wings; it makes all the difference. ComfortLA is currently serving food through curbside pickup and delivery via DoorDash, UberEats, GrubHub, ChowNow, Postmates and Seamless. 
Hilltop Coffee + Kitchen
A place for people to connect with each other and themselves, Hilltop is a cafe that offers breakfast and lunch items along with the usual coffee and pastry pickings. With three different locations to choose from, Issa Rae partnered with co-founders Ajay Relan and Yonnie Hagos for their Inglewood location.  
I decided to try their Black Rose Latte, a drink with rose, charcoal and in-house espresso that is available hot or cold and an açai bowl with granola, mixed berries, shaved coconuts and bananas. Never having tried anything with activated charcoal before, I was surprised at how well the flavors worked together to give a strong kick to the espresso. The generous serving of açai puree was freshly made and not overly sweet as it sometimes tends to be. The fruits added to the freshness and healthiness of the bowl, tying the entire dish together as a cool start to the morning. 
With a variety of drink and food selections, including beignets, waffles and drinks such as “Matcha-Chata” and “Almond Turmeric Latte,” I am already planning what to get on my next order. Hilltop Coffee + Kitchen is currently available through takeout and delivery via Postmates, GrubHub, Seamless, DoorDash and UberEats.
Hotville Chicken
Chances are you’ve already heard about this Nashville-style hot chicken that was brought to L.A. and is included on most places-to-eat lists, including the “2020 Los Angeles Times 101 Restaurant list” and Eater’s “38 Standout Dining Destinations in Los Angeles,” among others. Hotville Chicken is described as “a taste of Nashville, right here in LA,” and their spicy, hot chicken adds to the heat of the city. 
I ordered “the SHAW CHICKEN Sandwich,” which is served on a toasted brioche bun with a spicy spread topped with dill pickles (I got mine without pickles) with a side of seasoned crinkle fries and a side cup of Kaleslaw. There are four levels of heat to choose from, including “West Coast Plain Heat Level (0),” “Cali Mild Heat Level (3-4),” “Music City Medium Heat Level (7)” and “Nashville Hot Heat Level (12).” 
As someone who can handle spice, I am embarrassed to admit I chose the “Cali Mild Heat” to be safe, which was a good choice because after just one bite, I could feel my nose running and throat constricting. Between bites of food, I would come up for air with my entire body tingling with the spice, and yet, I couldn’t stop eating because the chicken and sandwich were just that good. The fries seasoned with spices were a great accompaniment to the sandwich but did nothing to help with the heat.
This is an absolutely must-try place whether you can take heat or not. My only suggestion is to think hard before choosing your spice level, keep a drink on hand and be prepared to cry a little through the pain of what is a phenomenal spicy chicken sandwich. Hotville Chicken is currently available for curbside pickup and delivery through Postmates.

Chances are, you’ve heard a song or two by the French electronic dance music duo Daft Punk at some point in your life. And if you think you haven’t, think again. 
Monday morning, I woke up to the music world in shock. News articles everywhere read “Daft Punk is over,” “Daft Punk announces breakup” and “French dance music duo split.” In disbelief, I’ve finally chosen to face the facts.
After a nearly three-decade-long run, Daft Punk is officially closing the book. Bringing 28 years of pure musical genius and legendary sound innovation to multiple genres across the music industry — from techno to pop to indie rock and hip hop — the electronic powerhouse duo has dropped the mic. 
I do admit, it’s always a challenge to see a legend go. 
Fans from all over the world, speaking different languages and from all walks of life, paid their respects and gathered in the comments of Daft Punk’s final farewell. Sharing fond memories and intimate stories, many thanked the pair for the love and life that their music provided them over the years.
“The wonderful thing about music and animation is that they can both travel across all borders, cultures, languages, generations and human races,” said Guy Manuel de Homem-Christo in an interview with Real Voices. 
There couldn’t be anything more true about that statement. As someone whose affinity for music goes beyond sound, I think Daft Punk accomplished what they set out to do in their years of practice.
Released Monday, the 8-minute video that broke the news titled “Epilogue,” excerpted from their 2006 film “Electroma,” features members Thomas Bangalter and de Homem-Christo walking away from the camera in silence. The announcement was not at all what I expected or how I would’ve imagined it to happen — but when it comes to Daft Punk, I think it’s fair to say one should expect the unexpected. 
Wind whistling softly in the background as they continue their strides ahead, in true robot fashion donning their gold and silver chrome helmets, the duo that changed music forever begin to part ways. Then, the silent whistle of still life is met by a beeping timer one member sets on the back of the other, and when the minute countdown is over, an explosion erupts. 
When it’s all said and done, the music begins to play and the screen goes black as we remember all that Daft Punk has given to the music world, fans and connoisseurs alike. From 1993 to 2021, the French pair Daft Punk left a legacy long in the making. 
Though I don’t recall the very first time I stumbled upon Daft Punk’s music, I can pretty confidently say the first song I ever heard from them was “Around the World.” Second to that, and the one most people immediately recognize was “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,” the anthem that echoed through my speakers for years and made Daft Punk a household name. 
With six Grammy wins and 12 nominations, I would say that Daft Punk has had an avant-garde, experimental, high-concept career — but one that has worked fruitfully in their favor (a rare occurrence for most). 
It isn’t every day that an international icon comes around. But when they do, people latch hold and some desire to emulate the talent they admire — attempting to replicate and reproduce Daft Punk’s sound in innovative ways. 
Beginning with their first collaboration in 1993 and the release of their first studio album, “Homework,” four years later in 1997, Daft Punk entered the music scene with a bang and changed it forever. Later achieving mainstream success, the pair have been deemed “genius” and “legendary” on multiple accounts. 
Now I’m not claiming to be a Daft Punk expert, but I have no doubt in saying their sound has influenced many artists’ music today. 
“Those guys are one of the reasons I make music, so I can’t even compare them to other people,” The Weeknd said about the duo in an interview with Variety. “Their branding and how seriously they take their craft and image and everything — they’re almost not even real.”
The Weeknd and Daft Punk collaborated in 2016 on the opening song of “Starboy” and the closing song of the album “I Feel It Coming.” The former came to be the duo’s first No. 1 hit track on Billboard’s Hot 100. 
From famously composing the soundtrack to “Tron: Legacy” in 2010 to creating yet another smash hit, this time with Pharrell Williams on “Get Lucky” in 2013, Daft Punk has seen a creatively successful and lucrative career.  
Though the helmet-wearing duo hasn’t released a new album since “Random Access Memories” in 2013, they have pushed boundaries of what it means to be an artist for decades. Resonating with three generations and impacting more to come, the enigmatic stars’ digital album sales have skyrocketed over 2,560% since their break up announcement. 
In essence, music is a very subjective experience for us all. Even if you have never listened to one of Daft Punk’s songs or if you’re a die hard fanatic yourself, there’s no telling otherwise how their music creates its own story for every listener. Each person is able to connect to their songs in different ways and associate them with different memories. And that’s the beautiful thing about their music — its universality and ability to impact and resonate with many. 
Though their time in the spotlight is coming to a close, Daft Punk’s music will always remain.

Veganism — the way of living that excludes all exploitation and cruelty to animals for food, clothing or any other purpose, according to the Vegan Society — has been gaining new followers. However, this now-popular diet wasn’t always this prominent. As few as 20 years ago, veganism was practically unheard of; in fact, the term “veganism” was only coined in 1944. The movement was originally tied to religion and philosophy, as its earliest supporters were religious sects and philosophers like Pythagoras. 
Today, the veganism movement is more closely tied to health, environmentalism and animal rights. While going vegan used to be thought of as losing a huge part of one’s life, it is now seen much more optimistically; veganism is about gaining a new lifestyle, full of enlightenment, harmony and health. 
Although it may be easy to dismiss the veganism movement as a fad, the statistics say otherwise. The majority of vegans are relatively young, showing the diet is only just emerging. Also, vegan foods are becoming much more popular. Most notably, the plant-based milk market is experiencing drastic growth. Plant-based milks, such as oat milk, are exploding in popularity, breaking into Starbucks and many grocery stores. 
The movement seems to be an ingrained element of society; it’s in magazines, lifestyle blogs and social media. According to a 2017 Report Buyer study, approximately 6% of the United States claim to consume this plant-based diet, a dramatic increase from 2016’s 0.5%. With this recent rise of veganism, popular food chains are offering up more plant-based options. Burger King has its famous Impossible Whopper and even KFC is testing out plant-based chicken. 
There are many reasons the rise of veganism is promising for the future.
First, meat production is extremely detrimental to the environment. Food production makes up a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. Of these emissions, 58% come from animal products. According to Earth Save’s Steve Boyan, creating one pound of hamburger meat is comparable to using a car for three weeks. In fact, meat agriculture produces more greenhouse gases than the world’s transportation, according to PETA. It uses an immense amount of water, creates lots of pollution and is the cause of much deforestation. 
Animal agriculture also brings pain to innocent sentient beings. The chicken industry practices chick culling, which is the killing of unwanted chicks. Chicks that are of no use to the factory, such as male chicks who cannot produce eggs, are put through a grinder days after birth. This happens to approximately seven billion male chicks a year. 
Veganism has several health benefits. Some people may be concerned that veganism is an unhealthy diet option because protein is an important part of the human diet. However, there are many alternatives to animal products that offer high amounts of protein. Vegans can achieve their daily protein intake through meat substitutes such as tofu, tempeh and chickpeas. Plant-based diets are also linked to reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and other health issues. 
Encouragingly, more and more people are becoming vegan. In Southern California, Los Angeles has its fair share of vegans. L.A. itself has 30 vegan restaurants. In the heart of L.A., many USC students are part of the vegan movement. Conscientious Living Organization for Veganism, Environmentalism & Reducetarianism, or CLOVER, is a conscientious living club at USC. They are active in the animal rights movement, participating in marches and visiting animal sanctuaries. 
Despite being thought of as scrawny and pretentious in the past, veganism has shed its old stereotypes. The diet is no longer unusual and is much more accessible than before. The recent trend in veganism promises a more environmental, ethical and healthy world.

This weekend the No. 1 USC women’s water polo team heads down to Tempe, Ariz. for the Arizona State Invitational where they will face off against No. 4 Arizona State University and No. 6 University of Michigan for two games apiece. 
Coming off a nearly two-week hiatus since their season-opening win against UC Irvine, the Trojans are hungry to show why they are at the very top of the Collegiate Water Polo Association polls.
On Friday morning, the Trojans will take on a blistering Sun Devils team that has won their first five games in dominating fashion. With their obliteration of Cal Baptist in last weekend’s two-game sweep, Arizona State has now upped their goal total to 84 on the season while only allowing 35 from their opponents. 
USC will look to record their 10th consecutive win against ASU (dating back to Feb. 2015), but doing so against a Sun Devils squad that is currently leading the nation in goals per game will be no small feat.
As they get ready for their first major outing of the year, head coach Marko Pintaric touched on Arizona State’s high-powered offense.
“They look like they have some new talent and their ability to score definitely improved,” Pintaric said. “They did train more consistently than any other team, and we see them as a very tough opponent. We will not be going into this weekend to relax, that is for sure.”
To finish off the tournament, the Trojans will face one of the better defensive teams in the country in the Michigan Wolverines. The Wolverines, like the Sun Devils, are coming into the weekend undefeated after giving up no more than seven goals in each of their first four contests. Their defensive dominance will be a tall task to overcome for senior utility Maud Megens and junior driver Grace Tehaney who combined for eight goals in their 12-7 win against UC Irvine. Michigan will be seeking their first win against USC in program history.
One of the key contributors in USC’s win against UCI was All-American senior goalie Holly Parker, who recorded nine key saves. In preparation for the upcoming games against Arizona State and Michigan, she noted how coronavirus has made their practices and time together all the more important.
“Being the best defensive team in the pool will help us move offensively,” Parker said. “But with [the coronavirus] and all these new regulations, it is very important that we take all the time we get together seriously so we can form that crucial foundation.
While USC’s roster is loaded with talent and coming into Tempe seeking big wins against two of the better teams in the country, there are still plenty of things they need to work on.
“At this point, we are worrying more about ourselves — core offense and core defense — than our opponents,” Pintaric said. “We want to improve those little things. In our game against Irvine we scored a lot of goals, but also had some bad defensive situations that created opportunities they luckily were not able to convert on.”
The Trojans will face the Sun Devils at 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. Friday and Saturday morning, respectively. They will end their weekend with a two-game battle against Michigan at 1 p.m. Saturday and 8 a.m. Sunday.

USC is slated to receive its next supply of vaccines for distribution next week and will be vaccinating on-campus employees starting March 1, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Thursday. 
Employees will be divided into three groups of descending priority to receive the vaccine as the supplies come in, based on their working conditions and frequency of in-person interactions.
The first group consists of workers who have remained on campus throughout the pandemic, including the CARE crew members that check identification at campus entrances, Department of Public Safety officers, Contemporary Services Corporation officers, and USC hotel employees.
The second priority group are employees coming back to campus who will be interacting with others in a limited capacity, such as faculty providing in-person instruction, researchers working with people, and campus facility employees.
The final group of employees are those coming back to campus who aren’t frequently interacting with others, such as faculty visiting their office and researchers working in labs. 
“We will work down through our vaccines, our employees on campus as quickly as possible,” Van Orman said. 
Surplus vaccines from this week were administered to individuals aged 65 and older living near the USC campus, according to an email sent to on-site employees. 
“We worked with our local community groups, our neighborhood council employees, to provide vaccines to individuals that were 65 and above that might not otherwise have an opportunity to be vaccinated,” Van Orman said. 
As of Wednesday, the Keck School of Medicine has distributed 30,000 vaccines and Student Health has distributed 2,729 first doses and 2,538 second doses, according to Van Orman. Both the University Park and the Health Sciences campuses currently house multiple vaccination sites, receiving vaccines depending on the supply of the state and county. 
Van Orman said she meets with Student Health teams to review their protocols for academic activities, which includes “a very rigorous process” of checking individuals in and out, providing supervision and wiping down chairs and equipment. 
“There’s a whole set of things that are in place to make sure that while people are here, even if someone were to be infectious during that period, their risk of spreading it to other people is really minimal,” Van Orman said. “That’s mainly through the facial covering, the physical distancing and the types of activities that are allowed.”
Van Orman recommends students still wear a mask, preferably two, and refrain from social gatherings. She advised students to wear either a surgical-quality mask or a cloth mask with multiple layers of protection. 
“I think it’s a great time for people to evaluate the quality of the facial coverings that they’re wearing,” Van Orman said. “If you breathe in and out and it moves with your breathing … you kind of feel that a seal is happening, that’s a good quality.”
Moving forward, on-campus access will be more controlled to prevent further spread, Van Orman said. Visitors will be required to check in and out, maintain a six foot distance, and wear facial coverings. 
Sixty students and nine employees tested positive for the coronavirus between Feb. 14 and Feb. 20. Both groups’ positive rates were below 1%. Two students were confirmed to have the coronavirus variant first detected in the U.K. and two other cases are under investigation, according to a statement provided to the Daily Trojan from L.A. Public Health and USC. 
“We are as a community, as a country, as a world [are] in a little bit of a race against time to get cases down, to stop transmission, to get people vaccinated before we have significant variant viruses that may not be as impacted by vaccines, for which people who’ve been previously infected may not have immunity, and which has the potential to be more transmissible,” Van Orman said. “It does make us want to really redouble efforts. At this point it’s really about continuing aggressive mitigation efforts.”
