Men’s basketball recruit J’Raan Brooks announced his decision to decommit from USC and reopen his commitment on Twitter last Friday afternoon. 
“Due to unforeseen circumstances stemming from the recent news that has come to light in regards to the Trojan basketball program — I have decided to reopen my commitment to examine other available options,” Brooks said in his tweet. “While USC is still very much a possibility, the uncertainty of their situation has led me to believe I should reassess my own.” 
Brooks, a 6-foot-8 forward from Seattle, becomes the first of head coach Andy Enfield’s three 2018 recruits to decommit from the program just three weeks after news broke of an FBI investigation of assistant coach Tony Bland and multiple other Power Five basketball schools.
While Brooks is staying away from USC for the time being, the Trojans are still an option for the four-star recruit in the future — if Enfield and the rest of his staff escape NCAA sanctions.
“I have nothing but the utmost respect for Coach Enfield, the rest of the staff, the school and fans of the program,” Brooks said. “However, I need to make sure what I do is best for my future, and ensure I am making an informed decision, while seeing how this process transpires.”
Brooks has been quiet regarding potential schools of interest since his announcement last weekend. Washington, a school just three miles north of where Brooks played high school ball at Garfield High, is in the hunt for Brooks, along with Pac-12 rivals Cal, Stanford and Washington State.
The rest of the 2018 class, four-star recruits Taeshon Cherry and Kevin Porter, remain committed to USC for the time being despite the allegations surrounding Bland, the Trojans’ head basketball recruiter.
Cherry, a 6-foot-8 forward from San Diego’s Saint Augustine High, decided to come to USC due to his close relationship with Bland.
“I have a good relationship with Tony and Enfield,” Cherry said in an interview with
Scout.com. “Their style of play really fits my style of play, and it’s a perfect fit for me.” 
Cherry is listed as ESPN’s 22nd-best player in the 2018 class and announced his commitment just days after Brooks.
Fellow Seattle resident Porter, a 6-foot-5 shooting guard from local Rainier Beach, remains committed to USC despite offers from UCLA, Memphis and Washington, among others.
For now, Enfield brings back most of his 2016-17 roster, along with three top 2017 recruits in Charles O’Bannon, Jr., Victor Uyaelunmo and Jordan Usher. But questions still remain for the Trojans come 2018 and beyond. Along with senior guards Jordan McLaughlin, Kurt Karis and Elijah Stewart, starting junior forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu are expected to leave school early to try their luck in next year’s NBA Draft.
With starting jobs up for grabs in 2018, USC could potentially land another recruit in Brooks’ place if he decides to forgo Enfield’s offer. Of ESPN’s top 100 recruits for 2018, just three have signed letters of intent. 
Along with local five-star center Bol Bol, USC is still in the hunt for No. 1 overall prospect R.J. Barrett and four-star prospects Elijah Weaver, Khavon Moore and Kamaka Hepa. Considering both Bol and Barrett have fielded offers from top-flight programs like Kentucky and Arizona, USC would be more likely to land Weaver, Moore and Hepa if Brooks elects to sign with another team.
If those targets aren’t interested, Enfield and company could potentially save that scholarship for a top player in the loaded 2019 class. While top overall recruit James Wiseman is likely to stay put in the southeast,
11th-ranked shooting guard Cassius Stanley from Sierra Canyon or 16th-ranked forward Onyeka Okongwu from Chino Hills could be drifting toward USC. 
Regardless of undecided recruits in 2018 and 2019, USC awaits the verdicts in the FBI investigations with fingers crossed. The Trojans open their season at home against Cal State Fullerton on Nov. 10.
Once someone decommits it is all over. There is no coming back. Enfield had to have some knowledge of what was
going on with Coach Bland  who sold out for a measly amount compared to his salary. Top recruits will not be coming
with probation/penalties very possible in the near future.

Oh yeah, something’s definitely different.
The past five seasons of Los Angeles Dodgers baseball have reaped five divisional titles and three trips to the NLCS. But in each of those postseason runs, something was undoubtedly missing from those teams, hindering their pursuit of World Series glory. Dodger squads of postseasons past lacked something — something you couldn’t quite put your finger on — a playoff magic of sorts that would lead to ultimate failure come October.
Over the past decade, Angelenos have witnessed the Dodgers strand runners in scoring position when a big hit was needed. When a strong inning of relief pitching was required of the bullpen, a Dodgers hurler would be sure to serve up a game-winning run to the opposition in devastating fashion. There’s been no shortage of postseason disappointment for L.A. fans over the past three decades.
But at the exact moment when Justin Turner launched a 3-run homer past the outfield wall in the bottom of the ninth on Sunday night, I concluded that this year’s Dodgers team is in fact, different. Turner’s walk-off blast, which gave his team a 2-0 lead in the NLCS against the reigning champion Chicago Cubs, came on the exact 29-year anniversary of Kirk Gibson’s legendary World Series home run in Game 1 of the 1988 Fall Classic. 
It doesn’t get more Hollywood than that. 
The Dodgers’ bullpen also performed heroically in Game 2, completely shutting down the Cubs lineup from the sixth inning on after starting pitcher Rich Hill delivered five frames of one-run baseball. Dodgers relievers combined for four innings of shutout, no-hit baseball: The only Cub to reach base was Anthony Rizzo, who was hit by a Kenley Jansen pitch in the top of the ninth inning. Through the opening two games of the NLCS, the L.A. bullpen has retired 24 of the 25 hitters faced. Chicago has yet to record a hit or walk against Dodger relievers in this series.
Jansen, in particular, has been automatic for the Dodgers, recording a save in Game 1 and a win in Game 2. Through 2.1 innings pitched against Chicago in the series, Jansen has struck out six and allowed only one hitter to reach base. Jansen is the finishing move that opposing teams never want to see the Dodgers resort to. 
“[The bullpen is] just executing pitches, and they’re ready when called upon and competing,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told the media following Game 2. 
Considering the Dodgers have been victim to bullpen meltdowns in past postseasons, it has been a refreshing sight to see Dodgers relievers locking things down in the early stages of the NLCS. Moving forward, Los Angeles must keep dialing up strong outings from the back end of its bullpen. 
Timely hitting and heroic pitching efforts are two
must-have elements for any team looking to make a title run in October. In their 5-0 start to this postseason, the Dodgers have put both aspects on display. And now, following Sunday’s magical win, Los Angeles is believing that the Commissioner’s Trophy could be coming to the southland for the first time in 29 years. 
The Dodgers’ postseason slogan in 2017 has been “This Team.” The slogan is appropriate, as it appears that this team could be the one to finally solve the championship puzzle for the Dodgers. It appeared so during the regular season, but through five games of postseason play, the Dodgers have confirmed that they have the championship attributes necessary to win a World Series title. 
“What’s different about this team?” Jansen said. “We all care about each other. It’s not about that one guy or this … every night it’s been someone [different] stepping up for us.”
Jansen’s sentiments about this Dodgerg team ring true. It’s been a different hero every night for Los Angeles all season long. The Dodgers have had 10 walk-off wins in 2017, coming from nine different players. 
The Dodgers’ collective efforts have brought them to the gates of baseball’s promised land. Two wins from a World Series berth and six wins away from ending a nearly three-decade title drought. This team will look to make another advance toward the Fall Classic Tuesday night in Chicago for Game 3. 
The Dodgers now leave the friendly confines of Chavez Ravine for those of Wrigley Field. Behind Yu Darvish, Los Angeles will look to take a stranglehold on this series and return home by the end of the week with the franchise’s first National League pennant since 1988. 
This team. This team is the one with all the potential to return World Series prosperity to the Dodger faithful.

Not too long ago, Chet Faker was running through the Australian awards circuit with his self-produced extended play “Built on Glass,” even taking home Best Male Artist at the 2014 ARIA Awards. In the wake of his success, however, the man behind the artist had a realization about himself and his alter ego.
“My whole life, I’ve had what I perceived to be very inconsistent tastes, moods, behaviors,” he said. “I spent a long time obsessing over that and trying to become one version of myself, but at certain point it was just like, ‘Maybe I am all these different versions.’”
Chet Faker was honest, but he wasn’t complete. To fix that, the creator reverted to making music under his birth name, Nick Murphy, with the intention of returning to his full creative vision. The most substantial project since this name change is  “Missing Link,” an EP that was released in May and has a darker, more menacing sound than his previous works.
“Life, I guess,” said Murphy, when asked about what caused the change in tone. “Growing up and being more comfortable with those dark energies, I think I shied away from that for a long time. There are some darker songs way back in the SoundCloud days, but I wasn’t particularly known for those. It’s kind of a return to some energies I had, and had been neglecting for a long time.” 
It doesn’t take long for Murphy to get back into that mindset on “Missing Link.” The first track “Your Time,” co-produced by KAYTRANADA, uses that brooding tone to its full extent, with the grim instrumental paralleling the desperation in his voice and lyrics.
“[‘Your Time’] was actually for [KAYTRANADA’s] album … but it didn’t end up on the record, it didn’t fit,” Murphy said about the collaboration. “This seemed like the last chance to put that song out, so that’s why it was up front on the record. It was like, ‘By the way, we’ve got this guy sitting here too.’”
Along with the change in tone, Murphy used his fresh start to venture into a new creative space — acting. The Los Angeles Music Video Festival, which took place in early October, saw the premiere of his short film “Missing Link,” meant to accompany the EP of the same title. It was Murphy’s first time acting, and he said the new medium was more genuine than he had expected.
“Authenticity is a huge thing for me, and I think I naively always considered acting as sort of faux, like you’re pretending,” Murphy said. “But it’s not really about that — it’s about bringing something that is real into the character, into the framework. Once I got into that, I found it really interesting.”
Tapping into the theme of embracing the multiple versions of himself, the film saw Murphy split between two personalities: the stoic, burdened man on a mission, and the man who is much more careful to live in the present. The former came naturally to him, but co-director Johann Rashid pushed Murphy to fully embrace the more liberated character.
“Anxiety is accessible for me,” Murphy said with a laugh. “The other one was hard at the beginning of the film, but it was a lot more fun to play with. This zen Nick, just being in the moment, and surrendering to whatever’s happening right now. It was actually quite good practice for me, to get out of the stress mode into another one.”
Instead of a plot with a beginning, middle and end to the storyline, Murphy said the film was originally intended to have a cyclical plot that looped back to the opening scene. The final version veered from that concept, but still saw a character searching for a beginning rather than finding resolution when it was all said and done. 
The real-life Nick Murphy still doesn’t know what his next move will be, but said that creating his visual work has already changed how he makes music, using a more collaborative approach rather than the do-it-all mentality he’s used to.
“This record I’m working on now, I’ve been working with Phil Weinrobe and Dave Harrington from Darkside,” Murphy said. “I’ve been working out of a studio more, and less from home. I think at this point, I know I can do everything myself … but let’s see how much I can give to the music, to the art. Working with other people, the art is bigger than you.”
Editor’s note: This post has been updated to include information about Murphy’s upcoming performance.

Last Saturday evening was the opening performance for Giuseppe Verdi’s Nabucco at the LA Opera. I’ve mentioned in my column before that opening night at the opera is my favorite time of year. Now that I work for the company, I get to experience every single opening night moving forward — and I can’t think of a better way to spend my evenings than at the opera house.
Since opera superstar Plácido Domingo was singing the title role, there was extra hype in the air prior to curtain. Everyone was practically pissing themselves in excitement over the thought of seeing Domingo perform live. And though the acclaimed Spanish tenor serves as general director of the company, he also performs with them often. But no matter how many times he graces the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion stage or stages abroad, audiences don’t seem to ever get sick of seeing him perform. In fact, the theater was almost filled to capacity, with both new faces and seasoned operaphiles in attendance. 
One of those operaphiles in the audience was my former high school voice teacher, Lynne. She tends to frequent the opera as much as I do, but this is the first time I had seen her in years. Knowing she’d be there, we made arrangements to grab a quick drink during the first intermission.
She ended up inviting me to the Founder’s Room in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, an exclusive dining room in the theater reserved for high-paying donors. I’d only been once before, years ago, and not by invitation from a donor — I went with a guy I was dating at the time, a singer for the company, during an after-show dinner that was hosted by the opera. There was something different about the air this time. Much more elite, more posh. Regardless, it was a wonderful opportunity to catch up with Lynne and discuss the happenings of our lives over the last two years. Each time we meet, I feel less like her student and more like a colleague, even a friend. It’s a refreshing feeling that I still need to get used to.

Over champagne and white chocolate-dipped biscotti, we mostly reflected on what I’ve been up to since we saw each other last. Our conversation started to get me thinking of 10 years ago, when I saw myself today. I thought of the person I used to be, a green 15-year-old dreaming to be an opera star. 
My life, surprisingly or unsurprisingly, is nowhere near where I thought I’d be. In the last 10 years, I’ve changed career paths four times, experienced numerous major depressive episodes, and have floated in and out of school. I mean, I’m almost 26 years old and I still haven’t earned my bachelor’s degree yet. 
And there is nothing wrong with moving at your own pace — in fact, I’m so grateful I took my sweet time figuring out who I want to be and where I want to end up. It’s absurd that society forces us to choose a major and long-term plan at only 18 years old. We can’t legally drink yet, but we’re expected to have our future plans in writing by the time we move into our dorm rooms freshman year.
However, this isn’t to say that I’m not satisfied with where my life is currently headed. I’m definitely happier since deciding to end my time as a stage performer. My only uncertainties arise when I’m around family — I’m still known as the “opera singer” amongst the extended Roshanian clan. 
Whenever I go to family functions and see estranged cousins or great-aunts and -uncles I haven’t seen since I was a teen, almost all of them ask me how the singing is going. 
I used to reply with a hint of embarrassment, not wanting to come off as a “failure” for having given up. Some will smile and nod politely, while others will cross lines and insist that I’m making a big mistake by not “pursuing my dream.” But I know I’m not making a mistake, because being an opera singer isn’t my dream anymore. I did love to sing at one point, and I’ll of course always love opera, but I never had the personality to make it as a divo. I’m much too neurotic and self-conscious to lead a life in the spotlight. 
Maybe that’s my own problem, but for now I’m much happier working behind-the-scenes on my computer.
It’s insane how many life revelations I had in my 15-minute, boozed-up conversation with Lynne during intermission. Though she may be a little sad that her most eager student is no longer pursuing a performance career, she’s still so proud of where I’ve ended up, in the way a mother is proud of her son. Even though I didn’t make it as singer, she told me that she’s glad I’ve maintained an interest in the art. And I am too. Regardless of the pressure we as young adults face to make critical decisions early, it’s never too late to change things up. I promise.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Last week, Undergraduate Student Government President Austin Dunn announced that the fall break proposal — a crucial element of his presidential platform — may be implemented as early as the 2020-21 school year. Fall break would come in the form of a two-day break during the eighth week of the fall semester.
According to Dunn, the proposal passed through USG, Graduate Student Government and the Academic and Faculty Senates, in addition to receiving President C. L. Max Nikias’ support, but awaits implementation. The 2020-21 school year is the earliest that this proposal could be implemented, as the committee responsible for establishing academic calendars does so three years in advance. But unfortunately, this does nothing for current students, many of whom will have graduated by the time the proposal is in effect. Furthermore, three years is a long time to wait for change that students have been fighting five years for, rightfully citing mental health concerns.
“Without a consolidated midterm schedule and the absence of a break, students soon begin to feel overwhelmed,” Dunn told the Daily Trojan.
As USC’s academic calendar currently stands, between the Labor Day weekend in September and Thanksgiving break near the end of November, students have 56 instructional days without any break. Additionally, all classes have their own schedules and syllabi, which can become overwhelming by the middle of the semester. Dunn cited substantially higher demand for counseling services at the Engemann Student Health Center between weeks 8 and 10, well known to the student body as midterm season. 
In recent years, USC has amplified its messaging around mindfulness and the importance of taking care of mental health. Indeed, studies like one conducted by eMenthe between 2013 and 2016 reveal how mental health can affect physical health. Others, like one by Columbia University’s National Center for Mental Health Checkups, demonstrate a correlation  between mental health and academic performance.
Among competitive, top-25 universities, USC has the longest academic semester, whereas schools like UC Berkeley, Georgetown University and Rice University each offer students at least three fewer days of instruction in the fall. Like other top-25 universities, USC affords its students quality educational resources and opportunities unique to elite institutions. But these resources and opportunities will be underutilized as students struggle from burnout, sleep deprivation, stress and anxiety. 
Poor mental health and physical exhaustion can affect the rates at which students pass classes or get the grades they need to qualify for prestigious internships and opportunities. If not out of concern for student well-being, the University must at the very least recognize how not helping its students take care of themselves could affect its reputation as a networking empire in the long run.
All prior attempts to pass fall break proposals ultimately ended in failure, primarily due to hesitation from the Faculty Senate, which has claimed that students would “take advantage” of fall break rather than rest. This argument is particularly difficult to understand — be it through getting ahead or catching up on work, or resting, the goal of fall break is for students to take advantage of the time they have to take care of themselves.
In either case, the success of this particular proposal marks a crucial step in the right direction. Due to the University’s rigid policies for planning academic calendars, according to Dunn, it is all that student government can offer at this time. But put simply, mental health is worth making exceptions for. If student health truly is a priority for the University, then this proposal must be enacted ahead of the 2020-21 academic year. Students who are presently enrolled in the University and are grappling with anxiety and plain exhaustion deserve fall break beginning next year. USC must recognize that mental health is an immediate issue, and one worth making compromises for in order to help students.
Fall break may not be a cure-all solution to the nationwide epidemic of anxiety and mental health struggles on college campuses. USC must invest more in its health center to offer wider access and shorter waiting times for counseling and other health-related services, and open up dialogue with teaching faculty and students to learn about student needs and potential compromises to help them both. But without a doubt, offering students a pocket of time to recollect themselves and breathe is the first step.
I would be in favor of a few extra days off if they were dedicated to helping others in need and worship and not just an excuse to party and sleep late.   My son, a double major with nearly perfect grades, has been working with the poor and impoverished  in Central America during his breaks from school for the last three years.  I wished more students gave back rather than take as it appears so many do these days.  While some party it up at Coachella, others bring hope and dignity to poor families in need.
As with many of the current opinion pieces in the DT, there seems to overwhelming sense of entitlement expressed over and over by what I assume are young women writers.  It’s hard to tell if these are in fact women as traditional Christian names have taken a back seat to call your kid whatever you like that seems to be the norm these days.
God Bless!
As someone who is a non-traditional student, getting my Bachelor’s degree for the first time at 43 years old, with over 22 years experience across multiple industries, I can state that I emphatically agree with this article, and disagree with Thekatman’s opinion.
A full-time job does not have assignments, presentations, homework, midterms, readings, exercises, career fair preparation, club activity expectations, sports team and coach expectations, in addition to managing work/life/exercise balance. Don’t even get me started if you have kids, pets or spouses. USC is a fantastic university, and I want to avail myself of the myriad resources and opportunities there. In order to do so, I need time. We all need the time. So while two days is not very much, it is important when you have so precious little in the first place.
Secondly, a job accrues time off the longer you are with the company. So, it’s not unusual to be able to take time off here and there, for whatever reason, and knowing that you accrue that time off is a tremendous peace of mind for those unexpected emergencies, illnesses, or injuries that occur because Life Happens.
Lastly, there has been a significant national reaction and THREAT to the well-being of so many students under the Trump Administration. False reports of a shooting, a threat to our immigrant students, hate crimes, etc. USC has been incredible in their quick and supportive response to this events, but the truth is, it’s a terribly stressful cultural environment for so many marginalized students.
I for one would gladly add two or three days to the end of my semester in order to feel like I had a sustainable load of time to plan out my semester in a smart way.
The views of the Faculty Senate are somewhat mischaracterized. We passed a resolution last year to support a Fall break. Thanks!
Paula Cannon,
Immediate Past President of the Academic Senate
Amazing how little these kids understand the real world. You think you have it tough now? If you cannot handle taking a full course load then don’t sign up for too many courses.  In the real world most companies don’t have a company holiday after New Years Day until Memorial Day. You don’t get Spring Break, Christmas Break in the normal corporate world.  
You can take a sick day at school and still complete the assignments if you do not have the emotional energy to go to classes.   Just remember that 2 days off doesn’t reduce the  umber of days of classes. Perhaps you did get 2 days off at the 8-10 week period, you’ll have to make the days up in Dec.
Friend, you don’t know what you’re talking about. Welcome to the real world, in which companies offer paid vacation leave. You’re a dumbass. Namaste
Your hateful is concerning and setting a bad example for someone who professes to be a USC student or alumni, and using the Lucasfilms moniker.  Try using your name and stop hiding behind an avatar and fake moniker if you’re going to slam someone for having a opinion that differs from yours.  You are the problem with this country.  You live and breathe hate for anyone who has differing opinion.  Isn’t that what Antifa is about?  BLM, BAMN, the BEI groups like the New Black Panther Party, communism, marxism?  
Though Paul Cannon and I have differing opinions, doesn’t mean that we make foul language slurs at each other.   As for the real world, university life is so much easier than the real world. Someday you’ll know about that.  While in school you have one goal to achieve.  Graduate with the best grades you can achieve and get a good job.  School isn’t any harder today than it was 10, 20 40, 60 years ago, just different.  If the load is too much for you guys, then take fewer classes.  You want 2-3 days off mid-Fall?  Fine, but know tha the work still has to be completed and that puts more work on you during the semester and might add those vacarion days to the end of the semester.
As for paid vacations, yes we do get them, and most companies only give new employees no matter their experience level 210 paid vacation days for the first 3 years, and you earn those vacation days on an hourly basis per pay period. You don’t them all at once.
Once in the work force you’ll come to realize that you don’t get 2-4 weeks off during the Christmas Break. We don’t get summers off. We don’t get Spring Break off. We don’t get Christmas Break off.  We don’t all get the federal holidays off except for a few.  You can’t call in sick just because you partied too much the night before.  You have to work, not laze around the office, factory, studio, wherever you work, just because you’re lazy that day.  .The real world is tough. University life is actually easy.  You should enjoy your life at university, but know that when graduation is complete, the real life begins.  Enjoy and Fight On.
I’m sorry to hear that you are employed in a position of such low status and have been so completely cowed by your “employer” (daddy?) that you can’t leave at will. I am neither a USC student nor an alumn. I work as a part-time mechanic and bicycle courier in Fullerton and my stepson graduated from ‘SC last spring. I really don’t see a problem with adjusting the fall schedule to give the kids a bit more time to relax. 
As for my moniker, you disgrace the feline world, Catboi.
You make my point 100% clear, that when liberals don’t have anything to say that’s positive and contributes to the conversation they resort to name calling. You have completely missed the message. That’s OK.
Point missed, catboi dissed, and my wife kissed. Today is like a novel’s pages. It’s in the books.
Mr. Lucas,
I’m gonna pray you find that bike or whatever else is missing in your life.
God Bless!

When I was a high school student, studying on the AP track at Ohio’s top public school, I heard two stories about plagiarism. First, that it is an accident a lot of the time. Second, that when it happens, you can get into serious trouble. In fact, I remember the perils of plagiarism being drilled into my head as early as elementary school. Throughout my education, we heard horror stories of students who plagiarized, who were caught, whose lives were turned around by one act of cheating. It felt like one of the worst things a student could do.
It didn’t matter to me that accidental and deliberate plagiarism are most of the time extremely different. When I learned that plagiarism often happens unintentionally, it became a constant fear that wheedled into my brain for almost all of high school. I was scared of a lot of things: failure, clearly, but also messing up — and to me those were completely disparate. Messing up connoted something more sinister: If failure is a result, then messing up is something rooted in a person’s character.
Worst of all, it seemed that failure was apparently something one could not predict; even despite hard work and being respectful to adults and being proactive, it could happen. And then what did that mean? Well, then, it must be the student’s fault. It must be because they are lazy. That they did not try hard enough. That they didn’t care. Or maybe, they were just never good enough in the first place.
Last week, The New York Times published a feature-length article about adolescent anxiety — “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering From Severe Anxiety?” — and I was reminded of mental health awareness’ meaning to me in the first place: high school. I felt my heart rate go up as I read the headline, only because the article seemed like something that would collect “laugh” emojis on Facebook, that would make the case for teenage anxiety without getting the point that these kids were real people instead of numbers within a growing social phenomenon. 
But unlike most articles written by adults about adolescents, this one surprised me. It focused on treatment rather than the symptoms of anxiety itself — humanizing what anxiety means to high school students, highlighting the hope that exists in learning how to unlearn rigorous self-standards. Like me, the main subject of the article,  whose name is Jake, feared failure. The article’s focus seemed to be the failures young people don’t see coming, but in retrospect, these little failures meant nothing. They were not a reflection of merit, or hard work, but of circumstance, high standards and a system that measured success but not its cost.
In high school, I suffered. I pushed myself far too hard. Still, it’s hard to look back and measure that hard work with anything but pride. I feel the lasting effects of the mindset I used to make it through: I’m still an over-achiever, I still overschedule my days until they are filled with internships and classes and extracurriculars. I wish I had sought out treatment sooner, that it’s okay to sit back and relax.
One thing about the Times’ article that did give me pause was the race of its teenage subjects. Almost all of them are white. Which makes sense because it’s profiling kids, specifically, who were sent to Mountain Valley, a center — according to the article — that “costs $910 a day.” I am not white, and as I wrote in my piece last week, mental health awareness across all races and ethnicities is paramount toward humanizing all people in general.
From my own experience, Asian American youth are imbued with a heavy need to emulate the “model minority” stereotype — fighting for success comes with an immense cost to our mental health. That does not mean it’s necessarily family-based pressure we are experiencing — the typical tiger-mom story — because that is a stereotype that in itself only makes the problem worse. Last year, I took an immigration class where we learned that — buying into the model minority stereotype — teachers themselves will expect more of Asian American students, adding pressure to their lives. Maybe this happened to me. But it’s also clear that I felt, for a long time, that I absolutely had to conform to the image the world wanted for me.
Some people use this stereotype to view our younger generation as inherently weak-minded; to be a trait of an older generation to characterize millennials as softened, or snowflakes, or what have you. But the thing about anxiety is that it is, at its best, a constant weight sitting in the back of one’s head; at its worst, it is utterly debilitating. Still, as more people become aware of adolescent anxiety, they are starting to realize that such an epidemic needs to be reckoned with instead of seen as a stereotype without a solution.

Throughout my whole life, I wanted to be extraordinary. I wanted to be successful and unique and seen that as that. Who doesn’t dream of bylines in national publications, their face on television, Forbes 30 under 30, or an offer from a renowned company?
We’d all be lying if we said we didn’t have some small desire to have that glory inside us somewhere.
Now that I’m graduating in May, I spend a lot of time thinking about what type of “legacy” I’ll be leaving behind.
Will it be for writing inspirational columns in the paper? Advocating for diversity and inclusion in journalism? Will it for be winning a startup contest? For running a successful blog with the right branding?
Sometimes on my darkest nights, I tell myself it’s nothing.
But, are we not more than titles and who we know and what we did over the summer?
For years, we stack our schedules with activities we know we don’t have time for. But we don’t quit these things because being overwhelmed is better than underachieving. We never stop talking about how tired or stressed we are. We skip class to work on homework for another class, go out when we don’t feel like it because we don’t want to feel left out. Then, we accidentally oversleep or forget important commitments, and then self-loathe for letting everybody down. And repeat.
Of course we are more than such superficial things. But, society simultaneously tells us to be ourselves and to enjoy these four years while stacking the pressure that somehow whatever we’re doing is not enough.
I knew something was wrong when I found myself feeling jealous of someone with an internship at a place I never even wanted to work at, but thought I did because everyone in my major wanted to work there.
If there’s anything that I’ve learned through my time in college, it is that chasing fleeting success is like drinking from a cup that will never quench my thirst.
Nothing will ever be never enough if I can’t appreciate life for what it is. If I get an accomplishment, it won’t feel like enough compared to someone else’s. There’s never time to revel in success because … that person already accomplished that two summers ago. There will always be more. And I will never feel like enough.
My heart breaks when I listen to people talk about how much they love life, how much beauty they see in people and the world around them. People who not only appreciate every little thing, but also have the hunger and immense joy and enthusiasm to serve this world and its people.
My heart breaks because I can’t see the world the same way these people do. At times, my happiness feels conditional. I only feel happy if I get that job, or that relationship, or that validation. How can we all be living in the same place, under the same God, and feel absolutely opposite feelings?
A quote from American author William Martin says that we should not ask our children to strive for extraordinary lives. He says while it may seem admirable, it is the way of foolishness.
Martin says, we should instead “find the wonder and the marvel of an ordinary life. Show them the joy of tasting tomatoes, apples and pears.
Show them how to cry when pets and people die.
Show them the infinite pleasure in the touch of a hand. And make the ordinary come alive for them. I know in time, the extraordinary will take care of itself.”
I used to tell my mom that the worst thing in the world to be is just like everybody else. To work a 9-5 and follow all the rules of society and then just die without leaving something epic and grand behind.
But now, I think the worst thing in the world is to not find beauty in simple things.
I don’t want to look back and think that I did not have time to enjoy anything because I was too busy feeling like I wasn’t doing the “right career moves” or talking to the “right people.” That would be such a life wasted.
Going against the current, I’m going to try worrying less every day about what my post-grad job is going to be or feeling jealous of those who appear happier or more successful.
I just want to focus on making the ordinary things feel special. I want to find joy in breathing in the beautiful southern California weather. In walking on our beautiful campus. On buying the same salad every Tuesday from Seeds. On taking the Metro line to Santa Monica.
If there’s any underclassmen or stressed senior reading this — ask yourself — how much of your schedule is filled with things that you actually want to do? How much of it is just things you’re doing to please someone or to impress people you don’t even like?
Success is different to everybody; what you want in life doesn’t have to be what everyone else wants. I’m not condoning a lack of ambition, but emphasizing the fact that it doesn’t have to be the be-all end-all.
Notice that the things that fill your heart with warmth are things that you did not have to look far to find: phone calls with your mom, surrounding yourself with people that make you feel seen, your favorite lavenders in a jar, midnight talks heart to hearts, singing in the car.
What if the only thing you left behind in your legacy was not a long list of accomplishments, but actual joy and love for life?
That sounds pretty extraordinary to me.
I love your writing and your authentic voice, Erika. You’ve created and share something you should be very, very proud of. Many people take a lifetime to learn how to express how they truly feel. Those epic communication skills will take you anywhere you want to go!
great read, cheers!
