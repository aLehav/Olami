The NFL and the NFL Alumni Association have come together to aid retired NFL players with neurological conditions with the help of the Doctors of USC.
The NFL Neurological Care Program, announced March 24, aims to improve the quality of life for retired players. Neurological specialists will be available to treat former players at five medical schools around the country.
Along with the Doctors of USC, the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Mount Sinai in New York, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and the University School of Medicine/Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis will have a team of neurological specialists trained to help retired players.
Jeffrey Victoroff, Associate Professor of Clinical Neurology, and Carol McCleary, Assistant Professor of Clinical Neurology, will lead the team of doctors from USC who will provide care for players under the league’s retirement plan.
Former players with medical coverage will use their own plans to receive treatment, whereas those without medical coverage can apply to the NFL Player Care Foundation for a grant.
“As long as they are still breathing, there is an opportunity for treatment and recovery,” George Martin, NFL Alumni Association executive director told NFL.com.
Martin testified before a Congressional committee in Washington about the neurological issues for retired players, thus prompting the creation of a program dedicated to helping those individuals.
“A lot of alumni are concerned that in the not-too-distant future they’ll forget where they parked their car as a precursor to larger problems,” Martin said.
The Doctors of USC, with about 500 physicians and specialists, place the same emphasis on quality of life as this program as they are dedicated to “providing the highest possible level of care and the best quality of life for patients” according to USCUniversityHospital.org.
The NFL Players Association is not currently involved with the program, but Martin said that the NFL Alumni Association will continue to reach out to the union.

The USC School of Pharmacy recently began a new Ph.D program in Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics (CXPT) designed to bridge the gap between experimentation and implementation in medicine.
The program, which is part of the Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy, arose because of a movement in the pharmacy community to better integrate research and clinical therapeutics. An interdisciplinary degree, the degree program aims to train graduate students as translational scientists who can cross connect between basic scientific discoveries and clinical applications.
“There is a national shortage of scientists who could really bridge clinical care of patients with basic science and investigation at the molecular level. This program is unique in that its goal is to train scientists who could be “bilingual” in both worlds,” said Dr. Annie Wong-Beringer, vice chair of the Titus Family Department, who led the development of this program.
The USC School of Pharmacy is the first on the West Coast to offer such a program. The program is different in that students work with human samples as well as patients in clinical trials.
As of now, there are only three students enrolled in the program and, as Wong-Beringer said, the program will most likely accept a maximum of only 10 students at a time.

Spring practice started on Tuesday and already several Trojan football players have injuries to deal with.
Saturday was the first day the team performed in full pads, and the full-contact practice got the best if some players. FB Stanley Havili injured his left shoulder, FB D.J. Shoemate suffered a left hamstring injury and RB Dillon Baxter hurt his right quad.
Other Trojans who suffered injuries Saturday include DT Hebron Fangupo (ankle), OT Matt Kalil (hip), OG Zack Heberer (ankle), LB Marquis Simmons (spine), S Ryan McMahon (stinger) and OT Martin Coleman (right ankle).
One injury that could persist well into the season is that of Marshall Jones, who suffered a cervical S spine injury. Jones sat out the majority of last season due to a neck injury. By the end of Saturday’s practic, he was in a brace and out of uniform.
On the upside, C Kristofer O’Dowd was back Saturday after leaving early from Thursday’s practice due to a mild knee sprain.

There are two things that hint at what kind of show Krod Mandoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire is. The first is the title, Krod Mandoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire. The second is that the principal villain is named Chancellor Donold David Dongalor.
Comedic sword · Krod Mandoon, which was produced for both Comedy Central and BBC Two, infuses fantasy with slapstick humor. - Photo courtesy of Comedy Central  
With that in mind, it would be foolish to expect any semblance of highbrow humor from the show. Krod Mandoon, a British-American comedy made for both Comedy Central and BBC Two, doesn’t rely on the dry, witty writing that is more characteristic of contemporary comedies.
Instead, the show only really works because of pockets of inspired slapstick and absurdist humor strewn throughout an otherwise uneven comedy series. The first season, now released on DVD with extra features and uncensored material, shows signs of a premise with genuine potential — the real issue is whether or not this potential will be reached as the show forges on into a second season.
The story follows the travels of Krod Mandoon (full name Krodford, of course) and his entourage of fellow freedom fighters as they struggle against the Chancellor of Hessemeel, Dongalor.
Superficially, the premise works as a sort of parody of “sword and sorcery” fantasy tales, with emphasis on swashbuckling heroes and romantic side stories. The characters are all humorous takes on fantasy caricatures; Krod, for instance, is meant to be the brave-hearted leader, but is instead constantly distracted and oftentimes insecure.
Aneka, his short-lived girlfriend, fills the role of romantic interest, but uses sex loosely and often as a means of operation instead of being loyal and strong of heart. Then there’s Zezelryck, a young warlock who also happens to be completely inept at actual sorcery, as well as Loquasto, Krod’s “slave” that has been freed many times over but does not grasp the concept of freedom.
Much of the series’ humor comes from the silliness of the characters, and as stupid as the entire premise may seem, it is sometimes difficult to stifle a laugh. An encounter with a vicious Cyclops, for instance, becomes undeniably funny when it turns out that he is bisexual.
The character of Zezelryck is also played well by comedian Kevin Hart. His blend of Chris Rock’s incredulity and Eddie Murphy’s awkward charm provide an amusing backdrop to the trials of the characters as they voyage through Hessemeel.
Most notable of all, however, is Matt Lucas’ borderline ridiculous portrayal of Chancellor Dongalor, a vain and unimpressive dictator. The voice of the character alone is enough to make you grin.
Unfortunately for the show, a solid sea of storytelling mediocrity surrounds the occasional flash of funny. It seems that one of the reasons for Krod Mandoon’s poor Nielsen ratings is the difficulty viewers have getting hooked on the characters or the plot.
There’s simply not enough to keep viewers hanging on for more. Even in the span of one episode, it somehow seems entirely acceptable to zone out for large stretches of time.
Largely sub-par performances have a lot to do with it. For all his good-guy appeal, Sean Maguire (Krod) doesn’t always execute in terms of comedic timing (and let’s be honest, being in Meet the Spartans probably hurt his acting chops).
And could there be any more of a stereotyped display of homosexuality on T.V., as with Marques Ray’s character of Bruce?  Well yes — the preening, sassed-up Bruce certainly makes the list of cringe-inducing portrayals of gays.
More than anything else, the show suffers from a sense of familiarity and predictability, relying on the same slapstick and farce that was so refined by the Monty Python comedy troupe.
In fact, show creator Peter A. Knight admits that Monty Python and the Holy Grail was one of the biggest influences for Krod, and it is immediately apparent. Sadly, sometimes imitation is not the greatest form of flattery, especially when the attempt is nowhere near as funny.
At the very least, however, the show’s brand of humor is original: In today’s post-modern age of constant cultural references that pass themselves off as comedy, it’s nice to see a show that at least tries to be funny with its own circumstances and plotlines. Maybe it’s not quite on the mark, but there are certainly worse shows on cable T.V. at any given moment.
The DVD’s so-called extras are only basic standards like behind-the-scenes footage and outtakes; all in all, it’s not exactly a boonto anyone’s personal collection.
That said, Krod Mandoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire is the equivalent of affordable light beer: easy to consume, generally tolerable and a good backup for when there’s nothing better. Maybe the show will grow better with age. And if not … well, it’s certainly not hurting anyone.

A ninth-inning USC comeback came up short when junior Joe De Pinto struck out with the bases loaded, and the Trojans lost the rubber game of a three-game Pac-10 series against the Oregon State Beavers, 4-3.
On base· Sophomore Alex Sherrod had two hits in Saturday’s series finale against the Oregon State Beavers and scored one of USC’s runs. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
In his first start of the season, the No. 21 Beavers’ Sam Gaviglio earned the victory, pitching five and one-third innings, giving up two runs on four hits and striking out four. Kraig Sitton, who struck out De Pinto to end the game, earned his second save of the season.
USC (14-14, 2-4) sophomore ace Andrew Triggs took the loss. He went seven innings, giving up three runs on six hits with six  strikeouts.
The Beavers (18-6, 2-1) jumped on the board quickly in the first inning on a rare two-run inside the park home run. After Adalberto Santos led off the game with a bunt single, Michael Miller hit a line drive toward the left field wall that got lost in the tarp. The umpires ruled that the ball was still in play, despite Trojan sophomore left fielder Matt Foat throwing his hands in the air to signify a ground-rule double. Miller continued to race around the bases until he touched home plate, giving Oregon State the early 2-0 advantage.
The Beavers tacked on another run in the frame on Carter Bell’s RBI groundout, giving OSU a 3-0 lead before USC came to bat. Triggs settled down, however, and shut down OSU for the rest of his outing.
USC began its attempt at a comeback in the bottom of the second inning, when senior Keith Castillo and sophomore Alex Sherrod, who both collected two hits on the afternoon, led off the inning with back-to-back singles. Senior Mike O’Neill drove in a run on an RBI groundout, and Sherrod scored later in the inning on a Gaviglio wild pitch, cutting the deficit to one.
The Trojans threatened again in the seventh inning, loading the bases with two outs, but sophomore Kevin Roundtree hit a hard groundout to first to end the rally.
After the Beavers added an insurance run in the top of the ninth, USC loaded the bases again in the bottom of the inning. Sophomore pinch hitter Garrett Houts worked a two-out walk to make the score 4-3, but Sitton struck out De Pinto on a 1-2 pitch to end the game and the series for the Trojans.
USC’s lone victory of the series was Friday’s 8-2 win. USC sophomore Ben Mount pitched six innings, allowing two runs, four hits and racking up seven strikeouts. OSU’s Tanner Robles took the loss for the Beavers, pitching four and one-third innings in front of a shaky defense that committed six errors.
After OSU cut the lead to 4-2 in the top half of the seventh, the Trojans responded with four runs in the bottom of the frame to put the game out of reach. USC sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa, who drove in four runs in the contest, hit his Pac-10-leading ninth homerun of the season in the frame.
Saturday’s defeat marked the second straight Pac-10 series the Trojans have lost this season. With the victory, OSU won its first series at Dedeaux Field since 2004.
The Trojans host Cal State Bakersfield on Wednesday at       6:30 p.m. before continuing conference play against California next weekend.

With injuries decimating the roster and a quarterback competition keeping the spring interesting, it was defense, not offense, that characterized this Saturday’s third football practice of the spring season.
Frontrunner · Sophomore Matt Barkley remains ahead of senior Mitch Mustain in USC coach Lane Kiffin’s quarterback competition. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
The practice, the Trojans’ first in full pads, gave the team its first real taste of full contact practice, which caused some injuries to freshman running back Dillon Baxter and fourth-year safety Marshall Jones.
“It was a very physical, very long practice, but guys need to learn to get hurt and continue to play,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.
Despite the injuries, the defensive unit took full advantage of practice to show its strength.
Senior cornerback Shareece Wright, who will be the most experienced member of the USC secondary, made his presence known during the team’s scrimmage by intercepting senior quarterback Mitch Mustain’s pass.
“I felt the route coming and just broke on the ball,” Wright said of his interception.
Wright’s performance on the practice field Saturday helped him continue to grow into his role as a defensive leader.
“I try my best to work with the younger guys and show leadership on the team,” Wright said. “It’s leading by example more than anything.”
Wright was not the only defender to take advantage of a mistake on Saturday.
One of Wright’s backfield-mates, junior cornerback T.J. Bryant, intercepted sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley’s pass into coverage in the endzone — giving both competitors for the starting quarterback role interceptions on the day.
“We had a couple of turnovers and I’m excited about that,” USC secondary coach Willie Mack Garza said. “Any time we can intercept the football and get it back for the offense and in position to score points, that’s a great play. We need to get more of them.”
Asked after practice which quarterback had the edge on the competition, Kiffin gave the slight edge to Barkley, but assured the media that the two competitors would continue to split reps in practice as they had last week.
“It’s real early, we’ll let both guys alternate in [the offense] and see where it goes,” Kiffin said.
Barkley, who started all but one of the Trojans games last season, continued to impress Kiffin with his handling of the scrimmage offense in the first three practices of the season.
“[The competition] is based on accuracy and handling of the offense — getting to your second and third reads,” Kiffin said.

As course registration approaches, many students are visiting their advisers’ offices for help choosing their courses for the upcoming semester. But for students pursuing multiple programs of study, that meeting is not always as effective as many think it should be.
Last week, the Undergraduate Student Government passed a resolution recommending that USC consider offering interdisciplinary advisers that could help students figure out how to best approach their double major or minor.
Gene Bickers, vice provost for undergraduate programs, said he thinks advising is an important issue and one that should be addressed.
“What USG is calling for is more sharing of information and more responsibility at the university level,” Bickers said. “And I think that is right on track … I think it is something that needs more attention.”
Under the current system, students who have majors in two different programs are assigned to two different advisers. The proposed interdisciplinary adviser would serve as a separate entity, overseeing students whose majors or minor fall in distinct departments.
“I think it would be a good resource,” said Caroline Jing, a sophomore majoring in public relations and international relations.
Advising across USC varies by department. For Annenberg students, for example, it is mandatory that you meet with your adviser at least once a semester. Marshall, meanwhile, only requires students to meet with an adviser during their freshman and senior years.
“It does get tricky,” said Heather Cartagena, assistant director of undergraduate programs. “It is the decision by those departments that [freshmen and seniors] are the most critical students … they do not have the resources to meet with all their students.”
For small schools like the Roski School of Fine Arts and the School of Theatre, there are only two advisers on staff because that is enough to serve the low number of students. Majors like biology and business administration have a large number of students and limited counseling staff.
In the past, one of the big obstacles for students pursuing multiple programs was that, with the varying advising systems, often information did not get passed from one adviser to another.
“We found that advisers from different departments and schools were creating completely separate advising records,” Bickers said. “There was not enough sharing of information.”
In 2007, a database was created to coordinate better communication between advisers, and since then measures to create more efficient communication between departments have continued to improve, Bickers said.
Every adviser has access to the database where they can relay information and send referrals and comments to each other. Each student has a profile listing their GPA, units completed, majors and minors.
Regulations are also implemented in the current system that help advisers maintain contact with other departments. For example, there is an audit after the fifth semester for students who have a double major. For the audit, advisers from each department are required to meet together to make sure a student is on path to graduate.
But, despite the efforts to foster open communication and effectiveness some students still find trouble navigating through their schedule.
“It would be interesting to see statistics showing how many students had to stay an extra semester because of poor planning,” said Christine Tung, a junior majoring in biology and philosophy.
As more students begin to find a second major or minor, methods of advisement efficiency are in question.
“It’s a timely thing to be talking about,” Bickers said. “It’s certainly something we will listen too.”

The university announced Friday that President Steven B. Sample, whose 19-year tenure as president concludes in August, will be this year’s commencement speaker.

Sample, who announced his decision to retire in November, will address more than 10,000 graduates May 14 at the 127th annual commencement ceremony. Previous commencement speakers include Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ted Koppel, Neil Armstrong and Bill Cosby.
John Callaghan, a professor who is organizing the annual commencement ceremony and is serving as the university marshal, said he believes commencement will be the best opportunity for Sample to say goodbye to the university.
“It will be the perfect occasion for him to address the students for the last time, and I am sure that he is very much looking forward to this opportunity,” Callaghan wrote in an e-mail. “But I am equally sure that he will feel considerable sadness after 19 years at the helm, when he has been so very close to so many students and their activities.”
Many USC seniors said they are also happy that Sample is getting a chance to speak to them for the last time, but some said they feel short-changed, since the commencement address is traditionally given by a high-profile figure from outside the university.
Justin Layman, a senior majoring in political science, said the announcement was definitely not what he expected.
“Last year, having Arnold Schwarzenegger was a big thing,” Layman said. “This is more of a safe pick.”
Layman also said, however, that he believes this was a good choice because Sample was one of the best presidents in USC’s history.
“This is the one case where I would be okay with not having a high-profile speaker,” Layman said. “Some people might feel robbed, but … in terms of USC, he is high-profile.”
Miho Aoki, a senior majoring in biology, said she is happy the university is honoring Sample but is disappointed the commencement speaker is not somebody unaffiliated with USC.
“I feel like we’re missing out on the whole commencement experience,” Aoki said. “As students, we don’t really have a say on who the commencement speaker is.”
Aoki said she believes the university should consider allowing students to give their input in the future.
Vanessa Kuroda, a senior majoring in electrical engineering, said she is excited for Sample’s commencement address because she has never heard him give a speech before.
“From what I’ve read about President Sample, he seems to be very inspiring,” Kuroda said. “I’m interested in what he has to say.”
Kuroda said she understands why seniors would be disappointed, but thinks this is a good chance for Sample to give his parting words.
Henry Ho, a senior majoring in biology and political science, said although he does not care much about the speaker, he is a little let down by the choice.
“Given that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the speaker last year, I guess I’m slightly disappointed,” Ho said. “But the commencement speaker isn’t a big deal for me.”
Despite slight disappointment, many seniors said they are glad to see the university honor Sample.
“I definitely think it’s great for the university because of the progress it has made under his presidency,” said Eloy Ledesma, a senior majoring in business administration. “The experience he has provided here has been invaluable and it is incomparable to other schools.”
For all of USC’s bragging about becoming a top school, the pride, (and well warranted), the excitement, how it is now more difficult to get into than ever, more applicants than ever, competing with big name schools and now top on lists, etc etc etc..and ‘global’, expanding, more international students, study abroad, etc. etc. etc., the choice of Sample as speaker for commencement is such a contradiction to that, it just seems so ’small town’ and ‘insular’ for where this school is now….yes, he is partly responsible for that, but have a special DAY to honor him, have a special WEEK for him, with tributes in his honor to give HIM the send off HE deserves..but commencement is for THE STUDENTS… no one is saying he has not done an amazing job and just about everyone recognizes that..so honor him at commencement, but not have him as the guest speaker, when most have heard him speak many times over at school through the years. And he is a wonderful speaker.. but this is the students day. If USC is indeed up there with the other famous world renown schools then why not have guest speakers on the level those schools have? Not just some ‘celeb’, but someone OUT THERE in the WORLD, outside of the school, who has accomplished things BEYOND USC, since the hope is that our graduates will have many accomplishments BEYOND USC..I think Sample has done an amazing job. I also think he should recognize this as a once in a lifetime event for the grads, and should have been a big man, and been willing to step aside and give them the send off they deserve. Or all the bragging, all the notices sent to homes and e-mails regarding how great USC has become, pale, if the class graduating, at what seems to be the height of that rise, can’t have a world renown speaker of note on their commencement day, as other top schools have. . It seems that everything at USC has GROWN, except in this area. This area has now, this year, gotten SMALLER…If there was a committee in charge of seeking out and booking a speaker for this special day they should all be replaced, as this was not only a huge oversight, a big mistake of judgment, but seems to be laziness, taking the low road, in the extreme. Or was it University POLITICS, which would be very sad as it is the graduates who suffer …The students have been encouraged to ‘go for it’ to think big, think global, expand themselves in their years at USC, just as the school has done.. and then they get the easiest choice to speak at their graduation…and the grads, who have worked so hard, and have been so committed to, and proud of, the greatness of their school, deserve better on THEIR very special day..not the President’s day, not the Alums day, not the UNIVERSITY POWERS THAT BE day, but THEIR day.
Just another day. Just another speech. Its Mr Sample again. Oh wait !!! I am graduating today …. I dont need to listen to this guy speak again…. He has his speech all mixed up .. He is reading last year’s commencement speech trying to pull of a Schwarzenegger.
What a nightmare … Its a special day for a lot of us. Dont rob us of a befitting farewell. Mr Sample is a well respected man, but not a Commencement Speaker.
And its USC … Live up to the name .. Make it Big.
Can we please have some national figure not affiliated to USC administration right now?? I am not trying anyway to demean President Sample, in fact he has been a one of the best president we had till now. But still i feel like being robbed of my right and its pretty disappointing.
I’ve been waiting forward to hear who our commencement speaker will be for this year. I’m pretty disappointed with who it’s going to be especially since we’ve had some high profile speakers in the past years. I’m not against the fact that Sample is speaking at our commencement, just that he IS our commencement speaker. We’re totally getting the short end of the stick and I totally feel like I’m being cheated especially since they had Schwarzenegger the year before.
I agree with all these other posts. We have work hard for this day… and paid enough to get us here.. we should have someone better..
there really is not anything else to say.
I love Sample.
BUT
This should be about US…not HIM.
we’ve earned that at least.
I’m not upset that Sample is speaking, just disappointed.  Let’s have Sample speak IN ADDITION to someone else!
yes…very disappointing indeed. no doubt president sample has been a huge influence on usc over the last couple decades and has had a positive effect on all our educations, but, again, like so many people have pointed out, he speaks at every graduation. we should have him speak, and someone else, a high-profile individual outside the university, just like in years past. in not doing so, the university is definitely short-changing it’s students and not allowing us to have the kind of graduation we have worked hard for four years to finally be able to attend.
USC..please have sample speak, AND someone else outside of the university!
I have to agree with the above comments.  While Sample has undeniably left his mark on our institution, this is a huge disappointment for the thousands of seniors who have spent their time at ‘SC.  It’s not about celebrity status or anything, it’s about receiving a message from an outside voice who may inspire us.  A commencement address by Sample seems to be more about the emperor leaving the throne to me.  Sample would have gotten his time to speak, and deservedly so, however, the class of 2010 will always remember a tinge of disappointment when they look back on May 14th.
This, in addition to all the construction that we have had to endure during our four years here….including the lack of a proper place for students to gather…..is extremely disappointing.
We as enrolled students are contributing to the growth and future of the school as well..and will continue to be asked to contribute monetarily to the school. Just today I was called about the senior gift. Rather ironic. If you want MORE of our money and more of our loyalty, at least give us an inspiring, memorable graduation.
Sad.  I love President Sample, but still pretty sad.  I’ve heard him speak about 5 times in the past, so that’s the only reason I want to hear someone else at my graduation.  I don’t think it would be changed, but  still very sad.  Oh well.  Goodbye USC. :(
You guys are the most whiny group of students. Do we always got to have some “rockstar celebrity” to speak at our commencement? 
It’s President Sample’s final farewell and you all lack the sensitivity to acknowledge that the 19 years he spent reshaping the “University of Second Choice” to a top-notch academic powerhouse is downright disrespectful. Sample left an indelible mark on this university, and started an era that USC has never experienced prior to his term.
Yes, we are wining, but for good reason. President Sample speaks at EVERY graduation. It would have been more appropriate to give him longer to speak for this graduation, while also still having an outside speaker. As a senior, I have talked to many of my friends and most everyone isn’t demanding we have a “rockstar celebrity” as you might think, we just want to hear from someone outside the university, someone we wouldn’t otherwise have a chance to hear speak. I’m certain none of us mean President Sample any disrespect and the work he did for the University was part of the reason many of us chose to come here, but we deserve a graduation speaker just like the classes before us and the classes after us.
Very true. This was supposed as an extra honour for President Sample, but instead this decision is demeaning for our year graduates.
Fred, I’m glad you’re happy with this decision.  That makes one of us.
This is a real disappointment.  I am going to try to contact the necessary individuals in order to get a real commencement speaker.
I am insanely disappointed. This is outrageous. Write John Callaghan if you are disappointed as well. This is the e-mail I wrote him.
“I understand that President Sample has been instrumental in shaping our great university and deserves a chance to speak at Commencement, but we as students–who have put in four long, hard years–deserve a proper commencement speaker. I do not know if I am more angry or entirely disappointed, but it is not a happy feeling.
Let President Sample speak; but please give us a real commencement speaker as well. We deserve it. That’s the honest truth
Please take these comments seriously as they are the feelings of a great majority of the graduating student body.”
I’m excited for the Steven B. Sample Commencement Ceremonies at the Steven B. Sample University of Southern Samplefornia, but I wish this university’s administration recognized that its students do not revere President Sample as Righteous Lord of All that is Wise and Great. He’s been a good president for USC, except for when he’s tried to make it all about him. This decision reeks of circular backscratching. It doesn’t bode well for USC that as Sample leaves, there isn’t a soul in the room to tell him that Commencement is not USC for “Coronation.”
This is disappointing. Not that it would not be worthwhile listening to Sample, but I was really looking forward to a  speech from a high-profile outsider for my Commencement. Gov. Schwarzenegger was an awesome choice. Really, they should rather have let Sample speak AND invited an external speaker as well. That might have become an event. Otherwise… no, just not interesting.
When I read the news this morning, I was disappointed. I’ve attended USC Commencement for the past two years. I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Iger deliver humorous and inspiring addresses. No doubt Sample will rise to the occasion…
HOWEVER, I saw Sample speak at both of those ceremonies and at various events around campus. Sample addresses the graduates every year at Commencement as he presides over the ceremony… I imagined he would do the same this year with a little longer address- his presidency does deserve to be recognized at graduation, but I don’t think giving him the main address is the way to do it. Sample as USC President has always been a main face at the graduation ceremony, making this pick altogether unimpressive.
This sounded like a lazy decision rather than an honoring one. It should be said that the disappointment is not in having Sample speak at graduation- that’s an honor- but it’s also a foregone conclusion as it happens every year in a smaller capacity.
Next year senior should be able to vote on their speaker.

Few USC graduates picture themselves ending up in prison, but that is exactly what happened to alumnus Justin Paperny, who became involved in unethical business practices and is returning to campus Monday to caution students against making the same mistakes he did.
Paperny, a former Trojan baseball player who graduated from USC in 1997 with a degree in psychology, was sent to federal prison in 2008 and served an 18-month term for crimes stemming from unethical business actions committed while working as a junior partner at UBS Wealth Management, a financial management firm in Century City.
This problem is not unique to Paperny.
Kenneth Merchant, Deloitte & Touche LLP chair in accountancy and professor of accounting, said at least one Leventhal School of Accounting graduate each year experiences problems associated with illegal business decisions.
“The worst is felonies, and then they’re getting sanctioned,” Merchant said. “It happens to at least one [former student] a year.”
Paperny, however, has decided to use his experience to help warn others.
Inspired to turn his life around by a fellow inmate, Paperny started a blog from prison in October 2008. Paperny would write blog entries and mail them to his mother, who would retype them and post them on the Internet. The blog became “Lessons from Prison,” which was published as a book in 2009 and is now required reading for business classes at several universities, including USC.
Paperny, who now tours the country to speak to business students, said he had never intended to become involved in illegal activity.
“My bad behavior, or unethical behavior, really started slowly. Nobody wakes up and says, ‘Today is the day I’m going to commit a white-collar crime and commit fraud,’” Paperny said. “I had this singular focus toward work and making money. I wasn’t able to discern the sort of person I was turning into.”
Paperny said he made his first unethical decision six or seven months into his career, when a senior broker advised him to pad his sales numbers so he could qualify for a $10,000 bonus.
“I can’t blame my senior brokers ­— I don’t blame anybody — but my senior brokers were teaching me the practical aspects,” he said. “I didn’t have enough patience or enough discipline at the time to decide there was a better way to do things. I knew it was wrong, but I figured the culture allowed it, so it must be OK.”
Arvind Bhambri, associate professor of management and organization at the Marshall School of Business, said, like Paperny, most people who become involved in illegal business dealings have no intention of doing so initially.
“People don’t set out to break the law,” Bhambri said. “It starts incrementally. It’s like riding a tiger, and you don’t know how to get off without getting eaten.”
Bhambri said it is vital that students who enter the business world have full awareness of what they are doing at all times.
“What I’ve found in my conversations [with former students] is that a lot of people will be engaged in unethical behavior, rationalizing it in their own mind, ‘This doesn’t benefit me, it’s for the company, if everyone else is doing it, it must be okay,’” he said. “And that’s a dangerous path. Just because something has been done a particular way before doesn’t make it right.”
Bhambri said USC business students discuss ethics in almost every course, and the university also offers a course strictly on ethical behavior.
“The debate that has gone on for a long time is whether we should have a separate course for ethics or if we should integrate it in [to all the courses]. We try to do it at both levels,” Bhambri said. “In the MBA program in particular, we try to get some exposure to ethics in the first couple of weeks.”
Nathan Lowenthal, a freshman majoring in business administration, is currently taking a philosophy course called the Professions and the Public Interest in American Life (PHIL141), taught by Professor Dallas Willard. Lowenthal said the class is a popular choice among business students.
“We talk about situations professionals are put in that require them to make tough ethical decisions,” he said.
Paperny said it is possible for students entering the business world to succeed while holding on to their morals, despite an environment that “tacitly approves” of unethical or even illegal practices that would benefit a company’s bottom line.
“I’m convinced you can,” he said. “You have got to be prepared to be different and know that it’s okay to say no to people.”
Paperny said the ability to make the right decision in tough situations requires daily effort.
“When I was a baseball player, I played every day and I got good. It’s no different being ethical. If you cultivate those habits daily and do it and not just talk about it — evaluate whether your words and actions correlate with the kind of person you want to become,” Paperny said. “When you practice doing the right thing, it will be so easy to make the right decision. But if you don’t cultivate those habits, it’s so easy to cross the line.”

The Office of Globalization has opened an office in Seoul, South Korea, the sixth of its international offices and the second to open this school year. USC hopes the new office will increase educational collaboration between Korea and the United States and provide new opportunities for USC students in Seoul.
USC Korea’s Opening Ceremony took place March 15, hosted by Vice Provost for Globalization Adam Powell and USC Trustee Yang Ho Cho, the only Korean national to be on a board of trustees at any major university in the United States.
The office will be directed by Steven Lee, a professor of East Asian languages and cultures. Lee said he sees great potential for USC to grow through its relationship with Korea.
“Korea has one of the fastest emerging economies in the world, and one of the world’s best-educated citizenry,” Lee said. “Consequently, Korea has become Asia’s hub for economic and education development. Capitalizing on these factors and extending on USC’s mission to offer opportunities for global education, Korea is an ideal place for USC.”
The goals of the new office in Korea include advancing research partnerships with foreign universities, prospective partners and government agencies; providing an increased amount of internships abroad for USC students; and identifying schools and students with the potential to assist in recruiting graduate and undergraduate students for USC.
According to Powell, USC has historically had a very strong relationship with Korea, hosting thousands of Korean students over the years — 873 currently. Korea is the third most-represented country at USC, behind only India and China, and the alumni association in South Korea has the largest membership of any foreign institution in that country.
USC Korea, the first U.S. university program to be approved as a nonprofit by the Korean government, represents the university’s increasing interest in Asia. Powell said Asian countries including China, Korea and India are of great interest to the USC faculty because of research and internship opportunities.
“We’re getting more interest from all departments each year in international partnerships and global research,” Powell said. “[Executive Vice President and Provost C. L. Max] Nikias asked me last year to double our programs in Asia — he believes it’s an essential investment in USC’s future, and so do the rest of the faculty.”
Of USC’s six current international offices, five are located in Asia and the next office slated to open will be in Mumbai, India. The other international office is in Mexico City.
Pei-Hsuan Chu, the director of the Taiwan Office in Taipei, which opened in 1998, said she thinks the university’s global push has been successful thus far.
“As far as I know, there is no school that is doing what we have been doing [in Taiwan],” Chu said. “No other university is as thoroughly involved in overseas education as we are; being on the ground allows local people to learn more about USC in their own language and their own culture.”
Pei’s sentiment is echoed by the faculty of the other international offices.
“Apart from Boston University, which has a local office mainly responsible for admissions, USC is the only university with a local office to not only manage admission procedures but also to assist with numerous events and activities in Hong Kong such as career placement and alumni relations,” said Sarah Lee, administrative and event officer for the Shanghai office.
The Mumbai office is scheduled to open late this summer and the university is hoping to launch another international office as soon as 2012, though the location has not yet been confirmed.
USC’s expansion into Asia also extends beyond the Korea office and the upcoming India office. In 2012, USC plans to open its Asia Global University campus, which will allow students to take USC courses in Korea.
“We live in an increasingly globalized world, and we’re trying to really invent what it is to be a global university,” Powell said. “Our network of international offices is a big part of that; we’re aiming to establish USC as a de facto capital of the Pacific Rim, a seamless hub of educational experience — national and international. That’s what our vision is here.”
Korea is a very corrupt communist country, why would we go there?
Please tell me you’re not an SC student, because you need to take some international relations or ethnic studies classes.

Students and faculty members are protesting the university’s decision to hire a controversial employment consulting firm that many think will influence the votes of USC University Hospital labor workers, who are scheduled to vote on whether to switch labor unions or forgo a union altogether in mid-May.
University Hospital labor workers say they are wary about USC’s decision to hire the Weissman Group, a consulting firm based in Ohio that workers say is notorious for its use of union-busting practices.
The group was hired by USC administrators and the hospital’s CEO, Michael Creem, shortly after labor workers announced in late September their decision to hold labor union elections.
“We actually got a memo that was leaked to us by some of the management staff that the Weissman Group had been hired as a consultant to help employees decide to vote ‘no union,’” said Michael Torres, a respiratory therapist at USC University Hospital. “We started noticing that managers were pulling in employees to meetings one-on-one, and they were asking them about their feelings, asking them about how they felt and what things could be improved.”
At the labor union election, which was originally scheduled for mid-April but postponed until mid-May, workers will have three options: stay with their current labor union, Service Employees International Union; opt for a new union, the National Union of Healthcare Workers; or choose to have no union. According to a statement from the USC University Hospital, the election will impact 686 staff members, including pharmacists, surgical technicians, physical therapists and other health care staff.
Voting “no union” would take away many of the rights workers have under unionization, such as free health care, free parking and wage negotiation.
“When the workers vote out the union, they become at-will employees,” Torres said. “They can be terminated without any prior notice at the whim of the boss, [USC University Hospital] can change their benefits at any time, they can lower their benefits at any time that management feels necessary because of the budget crisis or any other reason, or they can suspend their benefits [completely].”
Discontent with SEIU, the current union, began to grow after SEIU took over United Health Care Workers-West in January 2009 and shifted the union from local to international governance.
Workers say they’re getting less local representation, their grievances are not being handled in a timely manner and the accountability process has been turned upside down. Hospital workers decided to opt for a union election as soon as they were legally allowed to do so.
“As a result, all we’re trying to have now is a free and fair election so that the members at the facility can choose which union they want to represent them,” Torres said.
The presence of the Weissman Group, however, has left workers confused and angry.
“A lot of employees are frustrated, they’re kind of nervous because they’re not used to having managers or directors or supervisors pulling them into the office and talking to them about their feelings,” Torres said.
Torres said that since the Weissman Group was hired there has been pressure on employees to vote no union.
“Now employees are being purchased lunch. They’ll come to work and they’ll have cupcakes and cookies in their department,” Torres said. “All of a sudden, now the boss is the employees’ best friend.”
Higher-ups are not helping employees’ nerves by promising them incentives not guaranteed without union representation.
“They’re promising things they won’t put in writing,” Torres said. “I’ve been told by co-workers that they promised them that if they vote ‘no union,’ they’ll get tuition benefits that non-union employees at USC get. When employees ask to please put it in writing, they say, ‘Well, we can’t put that in writing.’”
Workers said they think the Weissman Group has been carefully training hospital supervisors on how to talk to the employees without crossing a line that would legally implicate them.
“They’re very careful to monitor conversations with the employees,” Torres said. “If at the end the employee opens up and starts speaking freely, they’ll say ‘Well, you know what, you should just vote no union.’”
The USC University Hospital released a statement saying, “We support our staff’s option to make their determination.” Officials did not comment further.
Some students at USC said they feel the university is not ensuring their workers’ rights and they are upset that university funds are being used to hire the Weissman consulting group.
“I’m so disappointed with the university for giving money to the Weissman Group,” said Elisabeth Gustafson, a junior majoring in history and member of Student Activists for A Beloved Community, a student organization that champions quality of life, health, equality and justice. “Our university is running like a corporation, it’s acting pompous and I’m so disappointed that we go to a school that would treat its workers this way.”
SABC member Elias Kohn, a sophomore majoring in sociology, agreed, adding that he favors a labor union for the USC University Hospital workers.
“The whole concept of the workers wanting to have a union that’s a little bit more grassroots, a little more local and not based in [Washington,] D.C. is something [we] agree with,” Kohn said.
Laura Pulido, a professor in American studies and union supporter, said this isn’t the first time USC has had issues with labor workers, though hiring the Weissman Group is unprecedented.
“To my knowledge, USC has never hired a union-busting firm,” Pulido wrote in an e-mail. “I believe they have in the past put pressure on workers through management in regards to union activity — but not quite like this. There is a long history of labor conflicts here at USC.”
USC’s SABC sent out a letter condemning the hiring of the Weissman Group and in support of workers’ rights to President Steven B. Sample, Executive Vice President and Provost C. L. Max Nikias, and Creem.
“If a lot of students knew that their money was going to a union-busting firm they’d be really disappointed because the students support the workers,” Gustafson said.
Though Torres said he was happy to receive widespread support from students on campus, he was upset at the administration’s handling of their upcoming election.
“It’s just very unfortunate that this union-busting campaign on behalf of USC has been driven because of their concern for profit,” Torres said.
The Weissman Group could not be reached for comment in time for publication.
I’m really surprised that people have the balls to say that they know what’s best for the workers at the hospital better than the workers themselves.  I think that if the people who have been in this story for years (the hospital workers) are overwhelmingly in favor of NUHW, then it’s probably safe to say that this union is the best choice for them.  You can speculate all you want as to what benefits the workers would gain if they voted out the union, but the fact is USC would be able to change or take away any benefits they’ve promised on a whim with no union to prevent this.  People like Diane posting on here should keep in mind that they’re arguing with people who have talked to hospital workers and union representatives about this conflict.
How about those workers who are in favor of NUHW, join NUHW, and those who don’t want to, can opt out? Why do we never see the pro-union liberals proposing the obvious, fair solution?
Oh yeah, now I remember, it’s because SOCIALISM DOESN’T WORK UNLESS YOU FORCE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. If half of the workers form a “club for lazy bums” who demand fewer hours and more pay for less work, and the other half outshine them, the union members will (rightly) be first in line whenever layoffs are proposed.
It’s ludicrous that a vote of 51% of workers can force the other 49% to submit their wages and their freedom to union bosses without their consent.
Hey Adam, if you actually read the article you would notice a worker by the name of Michael Torres being quoted. And another thing, the WORKERS decerted SEIU and the WORKERS signed petitions to join NUHW. And the Weissman Group does not give two sides of the argument, only one and that is: Don’t join a union. Students’ tuition fees are being spent on a union-busting firm and I find that disgusting. And DIane, you are just plain crazy…
It also mis-represented the issue and reported a few inaccurate facts. This all started because the employees were displeased with their Union, SEIU, and wanted them decertified. National Union of Healthcare Workers jumped on this opportunity. The workers did not invite them. The Weissman Group was hired not to “bust unions” or interfere with collective bargaining, but to help guide the university through the decertification process , and hopefully show USC a few practices that can avoid unionization. The decision is up to the workers…they get a secret ballot. Why not let them decide? I find it interesting that not a single worker is quoted in this article.
Adam you are correct in stating that the employees are displeased with their current union SEIU, anyone would be if you were paying dues and not getting representation.  California alone has 150,000 healthcare workers in their union at approximately $720 in annualy dues that comes out to $108,000,000 a year.  Of course the employees chose to stand up for themselves and elect a Union that will actively represent them.  NUHW was invited by the employees as a viable option for them as is their right.  USC unfortunately took advantage of the oppportunity to bring in a Union busting company to complicate things for the workers.  All the employees want is the right to elect their choice.  If you re-read the article you will see that Torres is quoted and he is an employee of USC University Hospital.  I do find it intresting that the Weisman Group was unavailable for comment.
No matter where you stand on the union issue, the Daily Trojan article (which was a news story, not an editorial or op-ed piece) did not have one sentence in it from a differing point of view.  I would hope that our journalism students would know that good reporting calls for at least providing both sides of the story…this did not have that.  Shame on the Daily Trojan for allowing an article like this to be printed.  
I hope that the teach-in being put together for April 13 will allow for a full discussion from all sides of the issue.  That would truly be a teach-in.
Lurid descriptions of the working conditions of farm workers are completely irrelevant to this discussion. The fact is (again) that USC employees enjoy generous benefits. There is, in fact, one enormous benefit that union workers do not have, and that is FREE tuition for their children or themselves, as well as 50% tuition for spouses and domestic partners, as well as tuition exchange scholarships at other schools for kids. So, for example, how does roughtly $38,000 a year in a free tax-free benefit sound to you? Also, if you work here 15 years your children will always have that benefit. If the hospital folks drop their union they get all these goodies. The difference in other benefits (health, retirement, etc.) is minimal at best, but probably leans in favor of USC. 
There’s your answer, Elias. And since unions as a whole, in this country, are contributing to our economic woes rather than solving them (SEIU has been AWFUL for California), I agree with Joe that I hope USC fights against them tooth and nail.
I find it interesting that we are making the “All unions are wonderful” versus “All unions are corrupt and destructive” argument again.  It is similar to the “laissez-faire capitalism is wonderful” and “laissez-faire capitalism is pure evil” argument.  Some unions are more good than bad, some are more bad than good.  In an ideal world workers would be appreciated and appropriately rewarded for their skills.  Ours is not an ideal world.  The questions we should be asking are how can we make workers lives better without unduly burdening the society at large.  Perhaps the threat of a union would be more effective with USC than the actual presence of a union for its workers.  A true partnership between workers and management would be most likely to succeed, which an academic environment has at least a chance of providing.
Hi Diane, I was hoping if you have some time if you could provide me with some sources to support your idea that union members on the whole gain by dropping their membership.
Any comprehensive study, personal contact, documented real wage increase/decrease and living standard conditions seem to disagree with what you said. The only fact I have seen is when free market policies are implemented the rich get extremely rich and the poor get poorer. The only exception to unions hurting its members is when a company closes down and relocates to where there are less protections (no union or weak enforcement, weak laws, or in other words your FREE MARKET prosperity claims only manifested in academic circles of rich elites and the actual “somewhat ignorant”). One of USC’s clothing manufacturers RUSSELL did this exact thing in Honduras, there was resistance throughout campuses in the US such as here at USC.  When the factory was reopened after a continental boycott of RUSSELL clothing by universities, the working conditions with a union, WITH HIGHER WAGES, AND BASIC HUMAN HEALTH PROTECTIONS opened. 
Despite your claims, the same thing is evident in California. Up in Bakersfield farm workers worked conditions that I cannot even fathom how their bodies operated week to week. After the United Farm Workers Union they still toil with extreme conditions, and unless you work in 120 degree heat 6 days a week 10 hours a day (without overtime pay) they work harder than you and probably everyone at USC. This said, after the UFW these conditions are less severe than they were, such as there being mandatory water on site and some protections from growers who simply did not pay their workers at the end of the week/month. To get that Union 4 workers were killed, one a 10 year old who the police beat to death. 
But again, if you know of any facts that provide any substance to your claims, I would be very curious to read them as I have not seen any to date which is one reason I do support workers choosing to unionize and disagree with hiring a corporation with students money to break up that act of self determination.
Workers have the right to organize and vote for a union.  For USC to pay an expensive consulting firm to break collective bargaining at USC’s hospital is outrageous and insulting.  I doubt USC would try tactics like these on workers on campus because it would be too visible to students, but I guess they think they can try to sneak it past the student body by doing it away from the main campus.
To say that non-union workers have better benefits on the university park campus is partially true, but that’s primarily because USC punishes workers for trying to have a voice in the workplace.  The unions on campus constantly struggle for more worker benefits.
So… one side is allowed to try and win the debate, but it’s an outrage for the other side to try and make their best case? Considering that its my tuition dollars the union thugs are demanding, I hope the university fights unionization with every iota of its determination.
Thank you for this well written article. To say it is difficult to get a job at USC, and ignoring getting a job anywhere is extremely difficult is a disingenuous comment. As an alumnus of USC, it is suprising that suddenly our students are ignorant and unable to see labor issues for what they are. Finally, it is a dodge to dismiss this article by claiming that workers don’t know what they are missing by being non-union.
The university provides excellent benefits to its non union workers. Why do you think it’s difficult to get a job here? It’s very competitive. This article (as well as the somewhat ignorant students who commented in it) entirely misses the point that the free market has provided great benefits to USC employees. Union workers, on the whole, stand to gain by dropping their union membership.

If you’ve ever seen Night at the Museum, then you might have an idea of what goes on the last Friday of every month at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London during their “Friday Late” event.
Wild-eyed and overcome with excitement, participants in the adults-only event scramble from one exhibit to another like children running from house to house in search of Twix on Halloween.
Themed “Playgrounds,” last month’s Friday Late event provided a night of interactive games centered on exploring the latest exhibitions after normal museum hours — it was a chance for me to unleash my inner child without feeling self-conscious.
Being a bit competitive and overzealous, I found myself scampering through the halls of the South Kensington Tube Station about two hours before the event in preparation for what lay ahead.
Ignoring the man jamming on his bass and signs pointing to the Science Museum, I somehow navigated my way through without getting sidetracked to the glass doors of the V&A museum, where my friends were patiently waiting for me.
After an hour of scoping out the lay of the land, we decided to break for dinner. Little did my friends and I know, however, that by the time we would get back — still well before start time — the main hall that stood empty just an hour earlier would be overflowing with people. The first rule when attending an event like this is to come early and stay late.
Evaluating the expanding crowds, we grabbed a leaflet with a listing of all the night’s events and earmarked the ones we wanted to go to. With only three and a half hours to cover the entire place, we made a beeline to our first game — Silent Relay.
Created by Berlin Invisible Playground, a group that specializes in making street games and audio adventures especially for Friday Late, Silent Relay offered participants the chance to “become an agent taking part in a carefully orchestrated operation through the depths of the museum,” according to the museum’s website.
By the time we got to the sign-up area, however, a long line was already snaking out the entrance. An overseer warned us it might take 30 more minutes before we got to play.
At 6:45 p.m., we figured we had to strategize if we wanted to make the rounds, so we broke up. Two of my fellow playmates hurried to grab tickets for the other events while I patiently waited for Silent Relay.
They came back with looks of disappointment. Less than half an hour after the event began, the tickets to two of the games had all been distributed. Not to be deterred, we plotted our next plan of action while continuing to wait in line.
When we finally got to the front desk, they informed us that we needed one more person to play. So we grabbed the first lone wolf behind us and invited her to join.
Iryna, dressed in a pantsuit and with her hair in a bun, had just gotten off of work. At 27, she was enjoying her second year of living in London while working her way up the corporate ladder.
After signing waivers and handing over I.D.s, we received an iPod and were ushered into a corner cubicle where two covert operatives christened us with code names — for 15 glorious minutes, I was Agent Buddha.
With a few cryptic directions and an official countdown, we pressed play on our iPods and were off.
Through earphones, a furtive voice prompted me to turn left past the Buddha statue. Guiding me back towards the main entrance, the instructions were quick, forcing me to move through the sculpture gallery at lightning pace.
The overwhelming masses of people and bumping techno music in the background made it difficult to keep up. Surrendering, I went back to the control center, only to find the rest of my gang looking as confused as I felt.
Although we never finished our secret mission, at least we had more time for the next game. With our newest member in tow, we raced to the Raphael room, where our next game was about to start.
Conformer, a trivia and body contortion game, required the addition of yet another player. With only one game down and less than half the night left, we eagerly looked around and recruited Ching, a Taiwanese girl on vacation.
As the clock counted down, we rushed to learn the game, which was a combination of Twister and Trivial Pursuit in the form of a race. After easily grabbing the lead with the correct answer of Washington D.C. (the question asked for the capital of the U.S.), we, Team Truth, won the game.
Rejoicing in a job well done, we were rewarded with the grand prize of an amazing, plastic … nametag.
Mission completed. Agent Buddha, signing off.

Clash of the Titans opens with images of constellations and a voice explaining how stories are written in the stars.
The revelation is both concise and seemingly profound; it marks the end of the movie’s overt poetry.
Greek life · Gemma Arterton (left) and Sam Worthington star in the remake of Clash of the Titans, a film based around the Greek myth of Perseus. - Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. 
On the surface, the remainder of Clash of the Titans looks just like any other action movie.
Like an archaeologist dusting ancient ruins, however, audience members can discover that Clash of the Titans is a simple commentary on contemporary American politics.
This movie is itself a sort of bastard child, just like the film’s protagonist, Perseus — born from a mortal woman after Zeus, disguised as the king, seduced her.
And the parentage of this remake is similarly conflicted. With equal ties to both the 1981 blockbuster of the same name from which it is loosely adapted and, of course, classical mythology, Clash of the Titans’ troubles origins are visible in the film.
Sam Worthington plays the demigod Perseus, but his performance is hardly a departure from his recent roles in Avatar and Terminator Salvation.
Worthington walks from here to there (with the occasional flight on a fantastic winged animal) to fight one battle after another.
Of course, he is obliged to make the occasional speech to inspire his companions. However, these little slurs of dialogue have little meaning because Worthington’s words fall on the ears of characters with too little backstory to survive until the movie’s end.
Two of the characters that do have lofty and well-established histories, however, are Zeus and Hades.
Liam Neeson plays the lightning bolt-wielding king of the gods, while Ralph Fiennes adds to his résumé of creepy roles with his portrayal of Hades, the sinister god of the underworld.
Neeson looks cool with his shimmering armor as he lounges atop Mount Olympus, and Fiennes does a fine job at contorting his back and having a generally nasty demeanor.
Unfortunately, these great actors are unable to make their characters interesting.
The two actors fail to convey the drama inherent in any kind of sibling rivalry. Perhaps these acting legends are simply too good, and in their lack of onscreen animosity is actually conveying how two divine brothers might actually interact. Even if that’s the case, however, it means little to a human viewing audience.
Gemma Arterton plays Io, Worthington’s love interest, who has the misfortune of being unable to age.
Her performance feels borrowed from the elven world of the Lord of the Rings franchise, and she is not given nearly enough screen time to do much with her role.
Similarly neglected is an oafish pair of hunters that join Worthington’s war party.
The missed comedic opportunities inherent to these characters represent yet another casualty of the seemingly endless cinematic battles.
Even with these acting problems, the movie is far from being uninteresting.
The story centers on Perseus, wronged and seeking revenge against the gods for the death of his family.
At the beginning of the movie, he denies his demigod status and insists on defeating the gods as a a human.
Eventually, he must come to terms with his special status and use it to his — and mankind’s — advantage.
Of course, this makes the outcomes of Perseus’ many confrontations with a number of monsters quite predictable, including his necessarily epic battle with the biggest, nastiest monster of them all, the Kraken.
His inner struggle is able to sustain the interests of the viewers, who actually have to watch as the sometimes dull skirmishes play out.
Why is Perseus’s inner struggle so compelling? Could there be a message beneath all the computer-generated special effects and inside a screenplay that seems too tired to care about its characters?
The answer is yes. Perseus despises the gods because they demand mankind pay homage to them and, thereby, empower them. In return, the deities bless and aid the weak human beings.
In one of the movie’s more compelling moments, Worthington emphatically claims men do not need to give their love to the gods because they share it with one another.
To empower mankind, Perseus must use the very weapons of the gods to defeat them.
If the situation sounds familiar, it’s most likely because the film is an intentional allegory of contemporary politics. Whether or not audiences choose to buy into the parallel doesn’t need to impact their experience.
In the movie, the powers that be want man’s payment of admiration, while refusing to have an open dialogue with those they supposedly love. Even though they suffer for their selfishness, Perseus cannot defeat them entirely.
Clash of the Titans is not a great movie. But like the stories found in the constellations in the film’s opening frames, a movie’s meaning can sometimes be the result of drawing a line from one dot to the next.
No matter what, Clash of the Titans is fun to look at; however, the viewer will have to work a little to make it anything more than a beautiful skyscape of shimmering light.
So, Perseus is a Tea Partier? I’m not buying it. The movie was great, though.

For the second tournament in a row, the No. 12 USC men’s golf team entered the final three holes of an event three pars away from victory.
And for the second straight tournament, the Trojans were unable to finish strong, playing the last three holes in a combined nine over par and slipping to third place at the Arizona State University Thunderbird Invitational in Tempe, Ariz.
“It’s extremely disappointing when we were in a position where we were in control,” junior Matt Giles said. “When you’re in that position, you really need to just keep making pars and birdies but unfortunately we didn’t do that.”
USC got as low as 17 under par in the third round before falling back to a 10 under par finish, three strokes behind tournament champion No. 3 Washington. The Huskies shot 16 under par on the final round and charged up from seventh place to win the title.
It wasn’t all bad news for the Trojans, however. Giles seemed to have returned to his All-American form from a season ago, posting his first top-five finish of the season.
“It’s all been coming together in the last few weeks and that’s exciting,” Giles said. “Now I’m looking to finish on a good note.”
Giles tied for third, shooting 70-68-69 to finish six under par for the tournament.
Sophomore Steve Lim led the field after two outstanding rounds on the opening day, recording 13 birdies and posting 68-65.
“I felt absolutely great. My putting and short game were absolutely phenomenal,” Lim said. “Everything was working.”
Lim struggled in the final round, however, shooting eight bogies and a double bogey to finish tied for eighth with a 75.
“I just couldn’t make any putts,” Lim said. “I just couldn’t finish at all. I couldn’t finish to help myself as an individual or the team.”
Freshman T.J. Vogel, who posted second-place finishes in the last two stroke play events, shot one under par for the tournament (69-71-72) and finished in a tie for 22nd.
Freshman Martin Trainer shot 71-74-70 to tie for 35th, while fellow freshman Stewart Hagestad had a rough week, posting                71-75-79 to finish 76th.
Redshirt junior Bo DeHuff competed as an individual and shot 69-76-71, good for a tie for 42nd.
The tournament also acted as a preview for the Pac-10 Championships, which will be held on the same Karsten Golf Course from April 26 to 28.
“It gives us an extra three competition rounds plus a practice round in order to prepare for [the championship],” Giles said. “We feel as though it’s a good course for us.”
All of the Pac-10 teams competed in the Thunderbird Invitational hosted by Arizona State. USC placed ahead of seven of its conference foes, finishing behind only Washington and No. 6 UCLA.
In spite of failing to close the deal on a victory for the second straight tournament, the Trojans’ third consecutive top-three finish has USC back into the national title picture.
“We’re much better now,” Lim said. “We’re at the top of the list. A couple months ago we had absolutely no chance [to win]. We’re on the right track.”
Giles agreed, saying that contending for tournament titles is a good sign.
“We feel as if we’ve really improved as a team and we’re giving ourselves opportunities, which is a great thing,” Giles said.
USC will tee it up on Sunday in the opening round of the Stanford Intercollegiate in Palo Alto, Calif.

Rivalries and crosstown showdowns aside, Saturday’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation clash between USC and UCLA had the makings of a match with enormous late-season implications.
Only one problem: The Bruins must not have woken up from the team-wide nap taken during their short trip from Westwood to South Los Angeles.
Upwards · In front of more than 1,000 fans, junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy and USC swept crosstown rivals UCLA at the Galen Center. - Gage Allard | Daily Trojan 
On a night that began with much anticipation, the 90 minutes of action ended as more of a coronation for USC’s three seniors (middle blocker Hunter Current, opposite hitter Jon Hackett and outside hitters Tyler Stevens and Matt Knutson) than a battle between teams looking to send the entire league a message. The No. 6 Trojans (13-9, 10-8) dismantled No. 7 UCLA (14-11, 9-9) in three quick, painless sets (30-26, 30-21, 30-23).
Anyone within earshot of the Trojans’ bench could easily hear sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli emphasizing throughout the match to his teammates that the night was about “not only sending a message to UCLA, but to every team.” And while in the heat of the battle those words can often seem more trivial than inspirational, USC’s rout of the Bruins was undeniably the most impressive message the team has sent all year.
What made the match so applause-worthy was the way in which the Cardinal and Gold stomped on its opponent, rather than who the opponent was. To be frank, it didn’t matter who USC was playing, no team was going to match the Trojans’ levels of energy and intensity.
In the first set, USC controlled the tempo early, jumping out in front 6-1 to force an early timeout from the Bruins’ bench.
From there, it was the offensive one-two punch of Ciarelli and junior setter Riley McKibbin that sent the highly spirited Galen Center crowd to its feet after a 30-26 victory (a margin of difference that would have been even greater if not for USC’s three net infractions). Ciarelli’s strength and power were on full display as he contributed a set-high nine kills, while McKibbin, true to his form, pitched in with 15 assists.
If the first set exemplified the team’s offensive fortitude, the second set was all about USC’s ability to capitalize on mistakes.
After an early ace and two kills from junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy, the Bruins unraveled at the first sign of trouble. Four costly errors, including two from the service line, put UCLA in an insurmountable hole at 20-13, a lead the Trojan attack made sure to maintain. USC would go on to win the second frame, 30-21, hitting .464 for the match.
It would have been hard to blame the Trojans if they had come out flat in the third set, but on a night where anything that could go right did go right, Troy and company would not let up. Behind Troy’s eight kills in the set, USC would go on to cruise to a final frame  score of 30-23 capped by an emphatic final kill from Current.
On the night, USC would hit a season high .423 hitting percentage, while sending its seniors out as the most successful Trojan volleyball players against UCLA in school history.
“The boys have been just doing a great job of coming together and playing as a unit,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “At this time of year, that is such a huge deal. Going forward, if we play as we did tonight, it is going to make it hard on any team we face in the future.”
While the Trojans concluded the home portion of their season schedule Saturday night, the team must not look into the future as it is set to face No. 1 Stanford and Pacific next Friday and Saturday.
Isn’t that four seniors, not three?

The USC women’s water polo team has turned away just about every opponent it has encountered this season.
In early-season revenge match against UCLA in the consolation final of the Stanford Invitational the Women of Troy dominated and earned a 13-3 win. In a UC Irvine Invitational championship matchup with then-No. 1 Stanford, the only team to beat USC this season — the Women of Troy (17-1, 4-0) came out firing in the first half and won 10-6.
Integral · Junior driver Joelle Bekhazi scored four goals in each of the Women of Troy’s two victories on Saturday, both career bests. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
It’s no surprise then that USC’s latest challenge wasn’t much of a challenge at all, as the Women of Troy dispatched two to McDonald’s Swim Stadium visitors on Saturday with ease, topping No. 19 Cal State Bakersfield and No. 10 Cal State Northridge, 18-4 and 18-6.
The 18 goals were a season-high. Junior driver Joelle Bekhazi led USC in the doubleheader, scoring a career-high four goals in each match, and junior two-meter Kristen Dronberger scored a career-high five against CSUN.
Senior goalie Tumua Anae totaled 20 saves while net-minding on the day. Anae extended her streak of double-digit save performances to nine consecutive matches. In the early game against Cal State Bakersfield, senior Kami Craig scored three goals in the first period to stake the Women of Troy out to an early 7-1 lead.
USC allowed just one goal in each period to the Roadrunners (13-17), taking a 13-2 lead at the half before closing out the game in the final two periods.
Against the Matadors                          (21-6), who entered the contest on a 10-match winning streak spanning more than a month, the Women of Troy had a tougher time.
Solid defense from Matador goalie Jillian Stapf helped CSUN challenge USC early on, as the Matadors come as close as 5-4 midway through the second period. But the Women of Troy took control of the match from there, responding with an 8-0 run. Bekhazi, who leads the team with 28 goals, and Dronberger, who has 12, each had a pair of goals during the spurt.
Ten Women of Troy players scored against Bakersfield, and freshman driver Constance Hiller put in her second goal of the season against Northridge to give USC 11 scorers for the day.
USC returns to the pool Saturday at Arizona State before a marquee matchup with UCLA at home on April 17.

Have you ever been really unlucky for a long period of time?
How about for almost four years?
And every time you were about to get on a positive run of some sort — every single time you started wondering if you were about to break your cold streak and snap out of it — you started getting unlucky again.
That’s pretty much the situation Chad Kreuter and the USC baseball team is in — according to Kreuter, at least.
The fourth-year coach won just about 50 percent of his games in his first three seasons at USC, leading many to expect he would be fired last May. But he wasn’t, and this season Kreuter’s team is .500 (14-14) again.
But it’s just a matter of luck to him, and he seems to think it will turn around, eventually.
“That’s baseball,” Kreuter said after the Trojans fell Saturday, striking out while down 4-3 with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the ninth.
“That’s baseball,” said Kreuter Thursday, after his team blew a chance to drive in a runner from second with the score tied 1-1 and two outs in the bottom of the ninth and then gave up three runs to visiting Oregon State in the top of the 10th. “We did what we needed to do, we just needed a break somewhere along the line and they ended up getting it in the 10th there.”
And there are more excuses too.
“Hey, we’ve had six games in conference, and four of those have come down to the last pitch,” Kreuter said after Saturday’s loss.
“We feel that we’re close,” Kreuter said. “But we’re not getting that big swing out of somebody in those situations. We need the team, the hitters, to make quality at-bats out of the at-bats they are having, and that starts with the very beginning.”
That might be true, but it also starts with you, Mr. Kreuter. There are a variety of reasons, undoubtedly. And by no means am I advocating fans to put the blame directly on Kreuter’s shoulders.
Private colleges have a significant disadvantage when it comes to college baseball. Every team, public or private, gets 11 scholarships they can distribute in any way they wish. For example, if a team had 21 players, they could give each player a half scholarship and one player a full scholarship.
USC has 35 players on its baseball roster. The school doesn’t release scholarship figures for its players, but it’s safe to assume the Trojans are splitting their scholarships pretty evenly among  players — with a few exceptions for star players and walk-ons.
Then think about a public school like Long Beach State. The Dirtbags have a reasonably good program, have been definite competitor to the Trojans in recent years and close to USC geographically.
Like USC, Long Beach has just 11 scholarships to offer players. But it also costs less to attend Long Beach — $35,000 less. In-state tuition at Long Beach State is around $3,500. Tuition at USC is around $38,500. And as a high school player from Southern California aims to be drafted by a professional baseball team and eventually make it to the major leagues, why would you ever pick USC?
But it isn’t a new development. Mike Gillespie — Kreuter’s father-in-law, in a weird twist — coached the Trojans under the same restrictions for 20 years and posted a .618 winning percentage and won a championship. And Kreuter’s four years at USC have been marked by an incredible loss of recruits to the Major League Baseball Draft. Kreuter, for a reason unfathomable to many close to the program, continues to recruit the best of the best high school prospects in the nation.
And they come. He’s a good recruiter. But, in the odd world that is college baseball, what he fails to realize is that those players will never actually end up attending USC.
Those players — like Jiovanni Mier in 2009, Tim Beckham in 2008 and countless others in the past few years — almost always end up being drafted in the first round and getting a gigantic signing bonus offer from an MLB team.
For a reference point, Mier got $1.4 million. Beckham got $6.15 million. They’re not coming to college.
There’s something wrong with the USC baseball program. Whatever it is — and, after covering the USC baseball team almost game-by-game for a season and a half, I have no idea how to fix it — Kreuter needs to change something about the way he’s running the team.
He can’t keep waiting, hoping or praying for luck to come around.
Because it won’t.

I’m not happy with the baseball program, but I will be out this weekend to see SC vs. Cal.
Yes so right. Must start to win more than one or two in a row. Kreuter is just not the man to do it with his lack of moves. The team should have swept Oregon St. with the good pitching all weekend.

The No. 4 USC men’s tennis team moved to the front of the Pac-10 conference with two very different types of wins over the weekend.
Big weekend · Senior Robert Farah won all four of his matches this weekend against tough Pac-10 competition including a tussle with Stanford’s Bradley Klahn in which Farah dropped the second set 6-1, but was able to win the third-set tiebreaker. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
With No. 9 UCLA losing 4-3 to No. 7 Stanford on Saturday, the Trojans (18-2, 4-0) remain the only undefeated team in conference play with two more Pac-10 matches left on the schedule.
On Saturday, USC hosted No. 17 California (10-6, 1-2) and defeated the Bears 6-1.
The Trojans started out quickly with wins at the top two doubles positions to take the match’s initial point.
The No. 8 team of senior Robert Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson played at the No. 1 position and defeated its counterparts from Berkeley 8-3, and at No. 2 sophomore Daniel Nguyen and freshman JT Sundling won 8-4.
During the singles portion, USC continued to rack up points as No. 1 Johnson, No. 83 Nguyen, and No. 123 Sundling easily kept their opponents at bay and clinched victories.
Soon after, No. 15 Farah defeated No. 71 Christopher Konigsfeldt 6-3, 6-4 to give USC a 5-0 match lead.
The Trojans split the remaining two matches, which went to third-set super tiebreaks.
No. 73 junior Jaak Poldma came up short at the       No. 3 position, but senior Jason McNaughton finished off the match with a victory over Riki McLachlan, making the most of his opportunity to contribute during conference play.
McNaughton has had an injury-plagued career as a Trojan and is relishing his opportunity to participate in conference play.
“It feels good to contribute to some good wins in the Pac-10 with a chance to win one of these Pac-10 titles,” McNaughton said.
On Friday, the Trojans entertained the large Marks Stadium crowd in a down-to-the-wire finish against No. 7 Stanford (12-5, 2-1).
USC beat Stanford 5-2 in a close match, which has come to be expected when the Trojans and Cardinal meet on the courts.
“We seem to have nine lives,” USC coach Peter Smith said in describing how his team pulled through another tightly-contested match against Stanford.
As with Cal, USC had some good performances from the top two doubles positions.
Farah and Johnson defeated No. 1 Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher 8-3, and Nguyen and Sundling defeated No. 31 Alex Clayton and Richard Wire 8-4.
At the No. 3 position, Poldma and junior Peter Lucassen were ahead in their match 7-4, before it was suspended when the doubles point was clinched after the completion of the first two matches.
The singles portion seemed almost a different match compared to the way the Trojans played in doubles.
To start off, Stanford was able to tie up the match score as Denis Lin defeated Lucassen 6-3, 6-4.
Johnson reclaimed the match lead — avenging a loss during the previous Stanford match to No. 45 Clayton — with a 6-3, 6-2 triumph.
In what Smith called the key performance of match, McNaughton defeated Greg Hirshman 6-4, 6-3.
Hirshman was previously undefeated at the No. 6 position, and McNaughton’s win propelled the Trojans to a 3-1 match lead with three three-set matches still being decided on the courts.
Poldma came up short in his match, tightening up the match score and ratcheting up the tension at Marks Stadium.
With the two remaining matches on the courts still in doubt, the large crowd was fixated on every point.
Nguyen pulled out the decisive victory, defeating Wire 7-5, 2-6, 6-3.
Nguyen has not been in such a crucial position often, but displayed maturity and poise to gain the fourth match point.
“I was happy to embrace the opportunity,” Nguyen said. “I was a little nervous, but it was good to clinch the match.”
Meanwhile, Farah and Klahn were locked in an intense battle. The match went back and forth as Farah and Klahn exchanged breaks to send the deciding third set into a tiebreak.
In the breaker, the struggle continued until Farah finally prevailed 7-6 (5), 1-6, 7-7 (8).
The Trojans’ success in close matches this season can be boiled down to one prevailing theme — experience.
“The team sees the bigger picture, they are very experienced and have lots of understanding of what it takes to win in these situations,” Smith said. “They have had success in close matches, which builds momentum and recall during the tough situations.”
With two more conference matches left in their dual match season, the Trojans understand the mindset necessary to achieve success and potentially win the Pac-10 title.
“We have to keep it going, and stay rested, healthy and hungry,” Smith said.

The Department of Public Safety is beginning to sound like a broken record.
Last week, the Daily Trojan reported that DPS officials plan to keep a weathered eye on the traffic problem areas near campus — mainly the McClintock Avenue and 34th Street intersection near Gate 5 — in order to reduce congestion and increase pedestrian safety.
Repeated pledges to control bicycle traffic last semester, however, yielded few results; many areas of campus still resemble poorly played games of Frogger. DPS has gone through many straits to clear up traffic on and near campus, including partnering with LAPD to issue tickets to rogue cyclists, impounding stray bikes and posting officers to monitor key intersections.
The fact remains that no matter how many times the university pledges to ramp up bike safety, campus is left in much the same condition as before — in need of sweeping traffic reform.
Though some have argued that the crux of campus congestion is motor vehicle traffic, cars and trucks are the exception on a campus largely closed off to thru traffic. For better or for worse, USC is a cyclist’s campus. A study conducted by the Student Health Center last spring found that there are anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 bicycles on campus at any point during the day, a number that will only increase as Los Angeles makes the push to become a more cyclist-friendly city. Plans to install a bicycle lane on Adams Boulevard highlight the city’s sway towards spokes and will only add to the number of bikes in the North University Park area.
Ultimately, most of the campus roadblocks are caused by student traffic, whether it be bike, skateboard, foot or the brave few who made it out of the ’80s in roller blades. DPS’s policies to curb the crowds have been largely ineffective, as problem areas have been dealt with superficially rather than at the source.
Posting an officer to the Gate 5 intersection is merely a Band-Aid on an issue that deserves more attention, just as bringing in LAPD officers sporadically last semester to issue tickets to cyclists was a quick (and faulty) fix. DPS has made threats to impound stray bikes and later admitted it didn’t have the storage facilities to back up these promises.
According to SCampus, bicyclists have free reign in traveling around campus, save for areas specifically restricted by signage and intersections. Rather than dealing with campus congestion on a case-to-case basis, the university needs to revisit its bike policy and decide whether the campus can support the growing number of wheels.
If USC is truly going to be a bike-accessible campus, then the university must make vast changes to accommodate its cyclist population — the first of which are installing more racks and exploring the idea of bike lanes on the main streets.
On the other hand, if bike lanes prove to be too costly and limited by the amount of space available, then USC needs to take a hard-line on its bike policy.
It’s time to address the cycling elephant in the room. On-campus traffic has become a formidable problem, and DPS is out of quick fixes. USC needs to spin the wheel.

Riding bikes to campus and riding bikes on campus are two separate issues.  The alternative to riding a bike on campus is to walk, also an environmentally friendly form of transportation.  What I would like to see is designated areas for pedestrians and for bikes.  Just today, I walked over to the Lot for lunch. There was a large group of elementary school students outside, blocking the sidewalk.  I went around, but a woman on a bike just rode right through them.  Luckily, no one was hurt.  It would protect the environment just as much if this woman had gotten off her bike and walked it.  I take public transportation as often as possible and plan to use the new Exposition line.  You could ban cars in a 10 mile radius around campus and I would be overjoyed.  I would ride my bike everyday, but I wouldn’t ride it on the sidewalks where there is a heavy concentration of pedestrians.
I find it sad that the “bike problem” means attacking a mode of transportation which is saving the campus and society at large untold sums of money. If all those now riding to class drove, it would be Carmageddon. There is way, way, too much of the USC campus and its surrounding road network (LA City property under the direct control of the LADOT) that totally turned over to the most expensive, dangerous, and polluting form of transportation one can use – the private automobile.
Bike facilities are DIRT CHEAP – paint, metal poles … what is so costly here? The planning documents will cost more than the “infrastructure” required to support cyclists in and around campus.
Training USC’s cyclists in proper cycling technique, CA law, etc. should become part of orientation for freshmen. The League of American Bicyclists teaches a course in the basics of riding a bike like a grown up, as does C.I.C.L.E. (a bike organization located in North East L.A.).
As the city’s largest (or one of the largest) employers, this isn’t just about students. Too many staff and faculty drive to campus as it is – clogging the roads, speeding away from the area once their day is over. The campus could do a lot to help local commerce by encouraging more people to bike, walk, or take transit to campus. USC’s  public policy team should be all over the task of traffic calming, car lane width reduction of removal, bus-only lanes, protected bikeways, etc. These benefit local residents as well!
Agreed.  Bike safety should be a part of freshman orientation.  As well as skateboard safety.  Imagine if all these bicyclists switched to skateboards!  Many would still bike against traffic.  Many would still blow through stop signs.
Other issues which might contribute the the problem at McClintock-Jefferson:  Too many traffic signs.  No bike lane coming out of USC.
Also, have USC, DPS and LAPD given up on getting students to walk bikes during the Walk Signal? Seems that way.  I see DPS riding their chariots and bicycles through the intersection all the time, during the Walk signal.

We should all wear woven hemp sandals and walk everywhere like Jesus did!!!!!
The riders of these bikes at USC and everywhere else are dangerous, careless and think that basic common decency and laws are above them.  Let’s stop them before they kill anyone else, imprison any more innocent motorists or damage any more cars.
We need to ban bicycles on USC’s campus.
“The riders of these bikes at USC and everywhere else are dangerous, careless and think that basic common decency and laws are above them.”
— I believe that most bicyclists aren’t dangerous.  They might be uninformed or misguided, but that doesn’t mean that they are careless or that they believe that decency and laws don’t need to be observed.
Your other statements are bombastic and over the top.
“We need to ban bicycles on USC’s campus.”
No, we don’t.  We can find a better solution.
I love to bike and would do a lot more of it if it were safer.  It is good for the environment, etc.  But the situation on campus is out of hand.  I walk across campus like a hunted animal.
Many campus have banned bikes.  I really don’t want to see that happen, but I also don’t want to get injured or killed.  I have posted some videos on Facebook under the USC group, “Motorists (and non-motorists) against bicycle nazism”   Unfortunate name.  You really can’t blame the students when the University has not made plans or provisions for proper traffic and parking.  However, bicyclists do not wear helmets, do not travel on the right side of the road, look at their phones, fail to yield to pedestrians and seem to have no clue.  How about an education program?  How about a few signs reminding people of the law?
The law doesn’t require bicyclists to wear helmets, but I agree that they should travel on the correct (right) side of the road.  That goes for anyone travelling on the road, including skateboarders and rollerbladers.  
When I’m around campus and see bicyclists texting or talking on the phone while riding, I get the feeling that either they don’t take safety seriously or they haven’t learned that this is illegal.
Agreed! 
I teach in the McClintock Building and in a classroom at the University Village, and that intersection of McClintock is treacherous, both for pedestrians and bike riders, who can be just as vulnerable in the event of an accident. Not to mention the rage that builds up in all of us after three-times-daily near misses. 
How about citizens’ arrests, documented by photos on our phones? $500 fines! That would be fun.
And then we can work on a reasonable new plan, which includes bike paths, separate from walkers.
Hi,
I really believe that a possible solution to the bike problem could be bike sharing on campus!
I have designed a system called CICLO and I presented the project in different occasions.
Now the file, with business plan and all the details is on the USC sustainability website, you can take a look at it here!

I hope that USC will go for it, because USC campus is a perfect place to start a bike sharing program that could be an example for LA, and  it would also integrate perfectly with the subway stops we’ll have within the year!
Let me know what you think!
Nicolo

With the arrival of warm spring weather, the purse pup is popping up again. Chihuahuas, pugs, terriers and other scantily furred little dogs won’t convulse to death if taken outdoors anymore, so their Los Angeles owners can once again sport them as accessories.
You don’t see people wearing kittens, parrots or hamsters. Dogs are unique as the primary element to many people’s fashion statements; they’re so beloved to man and lady that we have incorporated them into our wardrobes.
But what makes dogs so lovable? According to recent research, it’s because they remind us of ourselves.
Dogs mirror the qualities that make us human — differentiating themselves from other domesticated animals that have yet to wrestle the title of “man’s best friend” away from the paws of our canine companions.
A recent Associated Press-Petside.com poll found that 74 percent of participants were dog lovers, while only 41 percent were cat lovers.
Our infatuation with dogs is clearly visible around campus.
It’s been more than half a century since the death of George Tirebiter, the shaggy little mutt whom USC students once adopted off of the streets and made into our temporary mascot, yet he stands immortalized in statue form on Trousdale Parkway.
Further, strays who linger around campus are finding friends in the area. Students on 36th Street helped to collaboratively feed a one-eyed mixed-breed pit bull; in another outpouring of compassion, a female golden retriever lab was traded from house to house on Menlo Avenue, until students finally found her a home.

Dogs are the only species with such an obvious ability to know when they have upset humans, and feel bad about it — or, at least, to act as if they feel guilty. All dog owners are familiar with this: the sad face all teary and droopy-eyed, the tail between the legs and the apologetic whine.
In last month’s Scientific American Mind, the article “The Ethical Dog” discusses research showing that dogs really can tell right from wrong — that they truly know how to play fair.
Canids, including the house dog and undomesticated species like wolves and coyotes, actually give each other apologies. For example, when a dog accidentally bites another too hard during playtime, the guilty one will bow like a monk, stretching his paws out in front of him — a sign that he is sorry and would like to keep playing, according to the article’s authors, Marc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce. Dogs who don’t play fair are quickly ostracized by others.
The article further discusses findings that canids often roll onto their backs and let weaker dogs overpower them while they’re playing, allowing members of a pack to bond and ensuring that every dog gets to have some fun regardless of its size or strength.
Researchers have also shown that dogs, like humans, feel jealousy. In a 2008 University of Vienna study, trained dogs happily shook hands with experimenters without receiving a treat. But if experiments gave another dog a treat for doing the same thing, the original dog, having witnessed this, would cease to cooperate as though fed up with the injustice of the situation.
It is unclear why a blatant sense of right and wrong is limited to humans, canids and a few other species, but it does explain why humans and dogs get along so well. Clearly, we look for companions who are similar to us.
Even the popular belief that we purchase dogs that look like us has proved to be true. Last year, researchers at Bath Spa University in Britain asked subjects to pair pictures of humans with one of three different dog breeds — to guess which breed each person owned. The matches were right 50 to 60 percent of the time. They would have been correct only 30 percent of the time if it had been up to random selection, a Scientific American article last April pointed out.
So perhaps dog owners — especially in Los Angeles — are a bit narcissistic.
According to the Los Angeles Times data desk, the Chihuahua is the most common breed in the county, followed by Labrador retrievers, German shepherds, American pit bull terriers, poodles, cocker spaniels and then chow chows. Given what we now know about the tendencies of dog owners to purchase dogs that look like them, does this mean that a majority of L.A. residents look like Chihuahuas?
Let’s keep an eye out.  But for now, let’s agree that although our obsession with dogs might be a little vain, it is also a reflection of our empathy — the inability of USC students, for example, to let a stray dog stay stray.  We can’t help loving an animal who reciprocates that affection — a pet who cares about our desires and understands us, sort of.
