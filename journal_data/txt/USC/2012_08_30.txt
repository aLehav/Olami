For four seasons, USC coach Lane Kiffin and Hawai’i coach Norm Chow took the Trojans to new heights as offensive assistants under then-head coach Pete Carroll.

On Saturday, they will battle each other as head coaches for the very first time.
No. 1 USC begins its highly anticipated season at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Saturday against the Warriors, and one storyline leading into the game is the relationship between the two offensive-minded coaches. Chow was the offensive coordinator at USC from 2001-2004 and helped lead a resurgent USC back to national prominence. Kiffin served as receiver’s coach and as the passing game coordinator under Chow and maintains great respect for him.
“[Chow] really mentored [me and Washington head coach Steve Sarkisian],” Kiffin said. “[We] spent a lot of time with him, a lot of nights in old Heritage [Hall].”
Consequently, the Trojans are familiar with Chow’s offense, and the defensive players are aware of Chow’s history as well.
“We know Norm Chow’s a great coach,” redshirt sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard said. “I was looking at him as I grew up in middle school and high school when he was here, and [it’s] a great staff to be able to play against, a powerhouse offense like his.”
Kiffin acknowledged that the familiarity between the coaches might not be beneficial.
“If he’s going to be calling plays, which it sounds like he is, we’ve been exposed to him a lot,” Kiffin said. “But he’s also been exposed to us, too. So anytime you’ve played somebody, it works both ways.”
Chow is installing his pro-style offense at Hawai’i, where the run-and-shoot offense has been king for years. In addition, the Warriors will be breaking in several new starters.
Junior quarterback David Graves will make his third career start against the Trojans. Helping ease the transition, though, are his returning wide receivers: junior Billy Ray Stutzmann and senior Jeremiah Ostrowski. Stutzmann had just under 1,000 yards receiving last season, and Ostrowski scored five touchdowns. Senior safety T.J. McDonald is excited about the prospect of an aerial assault.
“The ball’s going to be in the air, and you want to make plays on the ball,” McDonald said. “We know our coach is going to put us in a greater position to make plays.”
Though the offensive side of the ball has gotten the majority of the headlines this offseason with the return of senior quarterback Matt Barkley, the defense returns eight starters to a unit that gave up just 17 passing touchdowns in 2011. However, the Trojans lost several key pieces, especially on the defensive line, and the team will be depending on younger players to step up their game.
“The beginning of training camp is always kind of slow,” Pullard said. “We’ve gotten way better since day one. We’re just progressing day by day and brushing up on our fundamentals.”
McDonald agreed with Pullard’s sentiments.
“We’ve been in this system for a while. We[‘ve] started to learn things,” McDonald said. “We start to ask questions that never would have came into our head before when we were younger… When those questions start coming up, you just start getting an overall feel for what’s going on.”
In terms of the offense, the Trojans are expected to put up some fireworks of their own in the season opener. Barkley returns after throwing a conference record 39 touchdowns in 2011, as do his star receivers, junior Robert Woods and sophomore Marqise Lee. Woods caught 111 passes last season, while Lee caught 73 balls as a freshman. Also returning in the backfield is senior Curtis McNeal, who ran for 1,005 yards last season. Junior Silas Redd joins the team after rushing for more than 1,200 yards last season at Penn State.
The Trojans figure to improve upon their 35.8 points per game average from last year. Hawai’i, meanwhile, gave up 29.1 points per game in 2011. Needless to say, the Trojans are expecting big things from a balanced offense this season, as is Redd himself.
“The offense can be more versatile now,” Redd said in regard to joining USC. “Not only with Matt [Barkley], but Robert [Woods] and Marqise [Lee] on the outside. So, if they want to bracket those guys, that leaves like six in the box, and that makes our job easier to run the ball.”
Saturday’s game begins at 4:30 p.m. at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The game will also be shown on Fox.

The USC Athletic Department and Trojan Pride co-hosted the second annual Fall Sports Rally at the Galen Center on Thursday night to celebrate Trojan athletics.

The rally, emceed by 2005 USC alumnus and Lost Angeles blogger Zack Jerome, was also a chance for fans to show their support for Trojan athletes.
“We’re here to celebrate our Trojan athletic teams as they prepare for battle this year,” Jerome said, “but we’re also here to celebrate … the students, athletes and fans who make USC more than a university — [they make] us a way of life.”
The event featured each of the fall athletic teams, from tennis to football, in a pep-rally style event designed to build excitement for the upcoming season. Students who attended chanted along with the spirit leaders, danced to the music of the USC marching band and many said they left feeling excited for USC sports.
“It was pretty spectacular,” said Stephanie Lu, a freshman majoring in biochemistry. “Now I’m excited to go and see [the teams] win.”
Aside from the athletic teams, entertainment for the evening included the USC Song Girls, Trojan Dance Force and “We Are Heroes,” season-four winners of America’s Best Dance Crew, and a rap from USC men’s basketball team member Renaldo Woolridge. He debuted his song “Fight On (We Play to Rise).”
As Woolridge began his performance, the court turned into a dance floor for student-athletes. Members of the basketball team and quarterback Matt Barkley danced together as Woolridge rapped, “What we do? / Fight on / fight on / fight on / we play to rock.”
The stars of the evening, though, were members of the football team, who are preparing for their Saturday game against Hawai’i.
When Jerome announced “the fuel behind the Trojan fire,” the crowd cheered, cardinal balloons fell from the rafters and football players back-flipped across the court.
“We’ve been waiting for this day for a long time,” safety and team captain T.J. McDonald said, addressing the audience. “We need you guys to support us on Saturday. You’re the 12th man on the field, and we need you.”
Students who attended the rally left feeling enthusiastic about the upcoming football season.
“Football wasn’t big in my high school, so it’s exciting to go to a school like USC where it’s so important,” said Gilles De Prevoisin IV, a freshman majoring in chemistry. “[This season] is going to be sick, especially with the team we have this year and the teams we’re up against.”
Kylie Morgan,  a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism, said she enjoyed watching the band and seeing the athletic teams.
“The football team was so spirited and the basketball team was cool. It was a lot of Trojan pride.”
According to Erica Fine, a member of Trojan Pride and an undeclared junior, the rally was only the beginning of Trojan Pride’s fall activities.
“We plan to advertise different games that are going on to try to get more people involved with the other fall sports, because they are just as important as football,” Fine said.
After attending the event, many students said the rally opened their eyes to the amount of sports teams USC has and are excited to go to many of the athletic teams’ games.
“I didn’t know we had a sand volleyball team,” said Hayden Buckley, a sophomore majoring in astronautical engineering. “It sounds so cool — I would go to see it.”
As for the football team, though, Fine said students should put on cardinal and gold, head to the student section and join in the USC football tradition Saturday.
“Get into the game,” Fine said. “The more you yell and scream and chant, the more fun it is and the more you embody the Trojan spirit.”

Nearly 100 students filled the Annenberg  School for Communication and Journalism’s lobby Thursday night to watch former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney accept the Republican Party’s presidential nomination.
Discussion · Margita Thompson, Alex Yebri, professor Gabriel Kahn and Dan Schnur participated in a panel following Romney’s convention speech. – Joanne Lin | Daily Trojan
 
A presentation and panel sponsored by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics followed the speech. Thursday was the finale of a three-day convention featuring various party leaders and prominent party members, including Clint Eastwood.
Typically, the Republican National Convention is a four-day event, but organizers chose to postpone the convention one day because of Hurricane Issac threatening coastal cities in Florida and Louisiana.
In his acceptance speech, Romney emphasized the importance of staying optimistic when facing a tough economy and threats overseas.
“We are a nation of immigrants. We are the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the ones who wanted a better life — the driven ones, the ones who woke up at night hearing that voice telling them that life in that place called America could be better,” Romney said.
Though Romney claims President Barack Obama’s policies and actions have not made America a better place, he admits he wanted the president to succeed for the sake of the country.
“I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed,” Romney said. “But his promises gave way to disappointment and division.”
Jerry Ting, a junior majoring in public relations, political science and philosophy, politics and law, said he supported Obama in 2008 but is disappointed by the president’s performance.
“It’s important to note that Bush did leave a big footprint and didn’t make things easy for Obama, but in hindsight Obama’s campaign was overhyped and his promise to bring about inspiring change was not kept,” Ting said.
According to Romney, Obama’s promises of hope and change made for powerful rhetoric rather than realistic solutions. Romney then explained his plan to create 12 million new jobs and the five steps he would take to make it happen.
Aaron Taxy, the president of the USC College Democrats, said he believes Obama should be elected for another term.
“Romney plans to slash and burn Medicare and has run a negative campaign with no substance,” he said. “Obama has lowered unemployment and is steering the country in the right direction.”
According to Romney, however, Democrats are not acting with as great a sense of urgency now as they did in 2008 because the President has not fulfilled the expectations of voters.
“You know there’s something wrong with the kind of job he’s done as president when the best feeling you had, was the day you voted for him,” Romney said.
Some students like Amy Gebert, a junior majoring in art history and political science, said though she is excited to vote in her first presidential election, she is more interested in voting for local initiatives than for presidential candidates.
“Local politics can impact your life and it’s important not just to vote in the presidential election but also in the smaller ones as well,” Gebert said.
The viewing at Annenberg was followed by a panel comprising Margita Thompson, former Bush for President Campaign 2000 press secretary in Calif.; Alex Yebri, President of USC Trojans for Mitt Romney; and Gabriel Kahn, an Annenberg professor. Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, moderated the panel.

Hundreds of janitors and union workers gathered in front of Bovard Auditorium and marched down Trousdale Parkway on Thursday afternoon to protest possible changes to their contracts and to make their voices heard as negotiations draw to a close.
“Justice for janitors” · A protest leader riles up the crowd of protesting janitors and service employees on Trousdale Parkway at the march and demonstration Thursday. – Mindy Curtis | Daily Trojan
USC’s janitors are contracted through an outside company, Aramark. The university’s current contract with Aramark ends Friday at midnight and workers said current negotiations for the renewed contract include improved health care benefits.
“Our priority is health insurance,” said David Mendoza, an Aramark-contracted employee who has been working on campus for 14 years. “They need to pay our complete insurance.”
According to Service Employees International Union member Raphael Leib, who led the rally and procession down Trousdale, workers hope the new contract will require a flat co-payment of $10 for most medical visits rather than a percentage of total medical costs. This change would also apply to their families.
“There are a lot of issues going on that affect us as working people,” Leib said. “Policies that affect working people affect their families as well.”
Sociology associate professor Veronica Terriquez, who has researched labor rights, said the janitor’s union has been instrumental in helping shape the fight for better working conditions throughout Los Angeles for the past 20 years, but there is a still a struggle for fair rights.
“I hope they get a fair contract and get what they deserve,” Terriquez said. “Health care is critical for people who do such hard work. It’s physically demanding and puts them in contact with dangerous chemicals.”
Jose Ramirez, who has been working on campus for 13 years, said the need for improved health care goes beyond just physical medical needs. He wants to see benefits comparable to those of other university employees.
“People get in accidents because of psychological pressure on the job,” he said. “We want to get the best we can for our workers. We’re trying to get the same coverage for medical, visual and dental insurance.”
Details of the new contract were not available to workers and union members at the time of the protest, but other complaints include consideration of salary and tuition benefits for children of Aramark-contracted janitors who work on-campus.
“We live check-by-check,” said Salvador Hernandez, who has been working on campus for 21 years. “USC can afford this program. Why are they going to strangle us [in negotiations]?”
Leib said part of the goal of protesting was to make the USC faculty and students more aware of their grievances.
“We’re members of the USC community,” he said. “We deserve the same respect.”
Several students attended the rally to show their support in the new contract negotiations.
“I talked to one of [the workers]. They have to work limited hours and don’t get health care,” said sophomore psychology major Mayra Morales. “It’s kind of unfair.”
Junior neuroscience major Samantha Castillo said she is concerned that workers will lose some of the rights and benefits they already have.
“I know they were cutting a lot,” she said. “I don’t want them to cut down on anything they already have.”
University administration could not be reached for comment at press time.
I’m an employee, not a student  or a student on scholarship. So don’t worry about me “taking” anything from you. I pay my student loans just like thousands of other working employees in this country. And as an employee I see first hand how the janitors and other “low skilled” workers are treated by students like yourself.  Even I have been on the unpleasant receiving end of a student’s entitled attitude, when my job is too help you.  Just remember that they are doing the job out of necessity to provide for themselves and their families. The least they can ask for is healthcare.
Where are those kids from SCALE who support Third World workers but not the ones that clean up the messes they make right here at SC?   Go back to San Marino you frauds!
You know, because janitors deserve to get sick, and their families deserve to not have medical care they can afford, and their kids don’t deserve to go to college.  The only thing they deserve is cleaning up after USC students own filth and rot.  It’s the Trojan way!
Skilled workers?  Well, it probably takes considerably more skill than sleeping through my business classes and facebooking through my GE’s, and my parents paid me a ton of money to do that!  But let’s get this fairness thing straight, the janitors mostly are brown-skinned, so of course they don’t deserve any rights or dignity.
If they all ready get the education package, then why are  they asking for it? Not all employees get this. Ask the people on the medical campus. Yet, you defend it as an entitlement. It’s not, even if you are a janitor.
Seems to me everyone is entitled to their opinion–even if you don’t like it. Sorry, but janitors are not considered to be skilled workers by anyone, other than yourself, apparently. This is not to say they do not work hard.
Maybe you are on scholarship–that means that someone other than you is paying for your education–this is a priviledge not a right. That someone is someone like me who contributes to USC–what do you contribute? Or, do you just take?
To the one who commented that the janitors are not skilled workers. When was the last time you cleaned a toilet after drunken students left it for them to clean up? When was the last time you worked for hours to clean a building only to have entitled students like yourself to come and start throwing your trash on the floor or even acknowledging they exist. These people work extremely hard without even a thank you.  I see these people everyday work, work, work without compliant and the least they can get from their employer is health care. You are attending one of the best schools in the country so please take advantage of your education ro expand your view of the world, or even yet expand your views on the people who work really hard so that you may attend a safe, clean campus. 
For the commenter Ann: As a USC benefit, all employees and their children receive an education package. Just like everyone else, they must apply through the proper channels and if accepted to USC, they may begin their education at USC. It’s not an entitlement if someone worked just as hard as the hundreds of other students that got accepted.
I am sorry, but part of being a “Skilled” worker is gettng the benefits that go with it.
Janitors are not skilled workers and they should not qualify for the exact same benefits that professors and administrators do. 
Where do you draw the line: That’s the negociation.
“They Can Afford it” 
This seems to be the new mantra of anyone and everyone who is looking for a handout from USC–from Armon Armstead’s lawsuit–“Into the Tens of Millions”, to the SAJE/UNIDOS stick-up for low cost housing to the tune of $20m, in exchange for okaying THE VILLAGE,  to the Janitors wanting a free USC education for their kids.
Where does this sense of entitlement come from? You have it–I want it.
 Pathetic.

If there’s an unspoken rule in this golden age of television, it’s that the truly great shows embrace moral ambiguity.
The Sopranos kicked things off with a sympathetic portrayal of mafia life and paved the way for mature, serialized storytelling like nothing the small screen had ever witnessed. From the cops and dealers of The Wire to the ad execs of Mad Men to the knights, nobles and bastards on Game of Thrones, the worlds in which these characters live and the systems by which they operate coerce them into compromising ethical positions.
The most obvious exception to the rule — and perhaps the best show on television because of it — is Breaking Bad. The story of high school chemistry teacher turned meth cook extraordinaire Walter White (played with consistent, Emmy-winning brilliance by Bryan Cranston) starts off by giving its lead character all the reason in the world to turn to a life of crime. After decades of professional disappointments, a cancer diagnosis renders him nearly terminally ill with no way to provide for his family.
But while serial killer Dexter can never escape his vengeful need to kill and the survivors on The Walking Dead are trapped in a zombie apocalypse, Walter is repeatedly given ways out of the meth business. He never opts to take them, and it’s his choices that make him a terrible person.
That’s the backbone of the show: Take a normal man and make him as black a villain as there’s ever been, not because of his circumstances but because of his actions. It’s up to each individual viewer to decide when he reaches the point of no return.
It sounds like a thrilling premise now, but when creator Vince Gilligan was pitching the idea, TV studios were less than enthusiastic. Over the summer, USC student Gus Bendinelli was given the opportunity to visit the set for several days of shooting and learned that in the beginning, “Sony Pictures expressed concerns over whether the show could even make it off the ground, or if its subject matter was accessible enough for mainstream audiences.”
“It was clear that Breaking Bad was something that had never been done on television before,” Bendinelli said.
Sure enough, for the first few seasons, the audience numbers were nothing special. But the ones who were watching were privy to one of television’s most compelling dramas, and the repeated accolades awarded to the actors secured Breaking Bad’s status as the best show nobody was watching.
As the quality only elevated over time — the score on MetaCritic.com climbed higher with each new batch of episodes — it became the show everyone knew they should be watching. Now, as it finishes up the first half of its fifth and final season, it’s reached new levels of popularity. With 3 million viewers, last Sunday’s episode was the series’ most watched.
Breaking Bad’s newfound popularity even justified an entire art show at Gallery 1988, a venue with exhibits inspired by pop culture landmarks. Dozens of pieces were on display and nearly all of them sold-out within days to fans willing to spend anywhere from $50 to $2,000 to get their hands on a piece of Breaking Bad memorabilia.
The show inspires that kind of cult-like devotion, with newcomers frequently burning through every episode in a matter of days and then finding themselves thoroughly unaccustomed to waiting an entire week for a new installment.
Yet that’s nothing compared to the season breaks, which would last upwards of a year while Gilligan and his writers decided what they wanted to do with the next phase of the story — sometimes meticulously planning every chapter so that episode titles link together to reveal future events.
The show mines every introduced concept for all that it’s worth, explores the consequences of every action in full and, as Bendinelli observed, “isn’t afraid to explore the depths of its characters,” no matter the dark reaches to which they lead.
Make no mistake — though Breaking Bad’s twisted, black sense of humor might contribute to its as title as one of the best shows on television, the pervading sense of dread and increasingly reprehensible actions of the characters make for a tense, soul-wrenching viewing experience.
“The writing pulls no punches,” Bendinelli said.
Here’s a show where every death means something, where characters choose to destroy themselves. No one’s watching for the happy endings. But once hooked, it’s impossible to turn away. To use an all too obvious metaphor: It’s addictive. But when the product is this pure, why fight it?
 
The last episode of the season airs Sunday on AMC at 10 p.m.

Little White Lies, writer-director Guillaume Canet’s ambitious follow-up to the Hitchcockian “whodunit” Tell No One, will certainly inspire discussion, although it might not warrant unabashed enthusiasm.

The film follows a group of Parisian friends who annually abscond to a seaside Cap Ferret home to escape the stresses of city life. But they are plagued with guilt during this year’s trip. While an interesting premise for a romantic comedy, or even a comedy-drama, the film attempts to incorporate too many genres for it to be truly successful.
Little White Lies opens with Ludo (Jean Dujardin) snorting coke at a club and leaving in the early hours of the morning only to be run down on his motorcycle by an oncoming truck. His friends gather to see him at the hospital in which he teeters between life and death. Ultimately, they choose not to cancel their yearly trip despite the tragedy, a decision that will disturb them throughout the film.
Max (Francois Cluzet), an obviously wealthy yet penny-pinching hotelier and restauranteur whose volatility and rage sets everyone on edge, funds the holiday. Another development adds to his hostility: His friend, Vincent (Benoit Magimel) has confessed his budding love for him. Vincent, who is married and has children, insists that he is not gay, which does nothing to calm Max, who launches into a homophobic tirade.
Other characters are just as troubled. Marion Cotillard makes an exceptional appearance as Marie, an anthropologist and former flame of Ludo, who has yet to find love in a sea of lovers. She is, above all, a free spirit who travels the world with little regard for those left behind.
Other miserables include Éric (Gilles Lellouche), a man unable to accept the end of a relationship, and Antoine (Laurent Lafitte), a man obsessed with his ex.
Canet has cited The Big Chill, a film about a group of baby boomers reunited by the suicide of a friend, as an inspiration. This is evident in a similar use of nostalgic songs by musicians like Credence Clearwater Revival, Janis Joplin and David Bowie.
But where The Big Chill heralded the ambivalent conformity of the activist Now Generation, Little White Lies does not strive to make any lasting social statements.
The film aimlessly attempts to include everything — comedy, drama, romance — in an effort to give the audience anything it might expect. Though an intriguing concept, the final product seems messy and overwrought rather than affecting.
As an indictment of no-longer-youthful urbanites, the film somewhat succeeds, but as a film, it has no sense of genre.
Little White Lies often focuses on silly and offensive comedy (Max’s homosexual rant) and overwrought melodrama. The film forgets the spectacular cast at its disposal, the actors capable of conveying more meaningful moments than the script allows.
Marie’s interaction with a sweet former flame, for example, allows us to briefly glimpse at the acutely observed story Little White Lies could be. To see an actress like Cotillard deliver such a nuanced performance in a film that never quite measures up to her talent is disheartening.
Additionally, the characters never inspire any sympathy in the audience. They are self-absorbed and out of touch from the moment they leave Ludo in the hospital until the final  condemnation from a seemingly random oysterman. They laze about in clubs and yell at each other, all the while forgetting the importance of friends and family in their hedonistic pursuits.
Max’s homophobia seems extremely unrealistic and dated in today’s world. Similar to many other characters, he seems like a relic. Perhaps the purpose of this film is to expose the elder generation’s obsession with youth, the selfishness of 30- and 40-somethings, or something in between, but it seems insincere and half-hearted somehow. The actors’ considerable talents are wasted on a script that gives them one-dimensional and deplorable characters as material.
Finally, there is a barrier between audience and character that seems exacerbated by the soundtrack. During moving moments, a swelling, overwrought score or song will play as if to tell us: “This is where you tear up.” It is a strange feeling, and it takes away some of the enjoyment from the film.
The runtime is also a meandering 2 1/2 hours, a lot of which seems unnecessary. The audience has no interest in these characters by the end of the film. Unfortunately, they never like or connect with them, either.
Therefore, that oysterman’s final monologue against the attitudes of the protagonists seems redundant.
The audience has known these things all along.

What does someone do when their act stalls? That’s the question asked about life and comedy in Sleepwalk with Me, and though the film offers something of an answer, the journey there  is just as plodding as its lead’s stand-up act.
Comic exposed · Mark Birbiglia co-stars in Sleepwalk with Me with Lauren Ambrose. The actor-director-screenwriter demonstrates superb visionary skills but fails to deliver a consistently strong performance. – | Photo courtesy of IFC Films
Adapted from comedian Mike Birbiglia’s one-man show, in turn inspired by Birbiglia’s own life, the film follows a fictional version of the comic at a changing period in his life. Co-written with This American Life host Ira Glass, the film puts its protagonist in a series of uncomfortable situations.
Matt (Birbiglia) is an aspiring comic whose career involves uncomfortable sets at comedy clubs to fill time between acts. He’s working as a bartender but thinks his career is going places despite reality. Meanwhile, his personal life is just as screwed up. His confidante, happy long-term girlfriend Abby (Lauren Ambrose), thinks their relationship is stalling and wants to get married. Matt’s own dysfunctional parents think he should do something with his life, but their constant bickering doesn’t inspire him with much hope.
To make matters worse, he’s developed a sleepwalking problem that often leaves him injured, and everyone else perplexed and concerned.
It’s a great set up for a character-driven dramedy, but Sleepwalk with Me never seems to get off the ground. And its faults lie solely with Birbiglia and Glass as screenwriters. The film lacks any sense of escalation or growth, and its lead never really clicks as an engaging protagonist.
Sleepwalk with Me revels in its awkwardness. Matt is, save for a few moments later in the film, horribly inept as a comic, and his sets fall flat both for characters in the movie and viewers. It’s hard to tell if the writers want to derive humor from this because it comes across as more uncomfortable than funny.
Matt fares much better in a few scenes near the beginning, before the stand-up becomes much of the focus. Some great early scenes in which he trades jokes with Abby are the film’s definite highlights. Birbiglia and Ambrose have a fun chemistry and their friendly banter adds weight to their romance.
But Matt’s problems also seem like Birbiglia’s problems as the lead actor. In those casual scenes, he’s engaging and charming. But when the film focuses on his growth and character development his charm wears off and he feels more irritating than sympathetic.
For such a protagonist-centric film, it’s hard to root for him.
Birbiglia fares much better as the film’s narrator, Matt, looking back at the events of the film. Directly addressing the camera or adding armchair commentary on his actions, he is forward, slightly sarcastic and much more engaging than the version of him caught up in the main plot. These moments have the momentum the rest of the film lacks.
When Matt’s personal life and his career stall, the movie does as well, despite the relatively short run time.
Brighter moments should occur when comedians Wyatt Cenac and Kristin Schaal pop in and out of the film, and although they never feel distracting, they don’t add much to the movie.
It’s not until the plot’s resolution that Sleepwalk with Me picks up, and since it’s the ending, it doesn’t help that much.
Despite the plot’s pitfalls, the story does allow Birbiglia to demonstrate his directing talents.
Birbiglia puts Matt in bright, tight angles when on stage, bringing out his nervousness with his act. The sleepwalking scenes — one standout of the film — definitely break up the plodding nature of the main story, with sepia-toned runs through fields and an action-packed race for Matt’s life.
Sleepwalk with Me does a fantastic job with its best elements. Birbiglia has proven an entertaining narrator and a creative, mood-setting director. But without much of a pulse to its story, the film mostly feels like a comedian mumbling through his act.

Nothing seems to attract more attention from the USC administration than bikes. Over the past several years, it has attempted to implement countless bike policies, including the most recent one designating bike lanes along Trousdale Parkway as part of the “We are Considerate. We are USC.” campaign.
The bike issue, however, is an exaggerated problem at USC. Though accidents do occur, the results are usually so minor they are inconsequential in the scope of everyday life.
Without stricter enforcement and knowledge of proper biking etiquette, the bike lanes serve as an inconvenience to bicyclists and pedestrians on campus and create confusion.
Rather than focus its efforts on implementing bike lanes, the administration should trust that students will exercise common sense and caution when biking on campus. In return, the student body should exercise caution when riding bikes.
Last year, USC attempted to establish No Bike Zones across campus during the most congested hours in terms of pedestrian and bicycle traffic. Students were required to walk their bikes near Tommy Trojan and the Lyon Center from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The only time students followed these restrictions, though, was when Dept. of Public Safety officers stood at intersections, enforcing the policy and threatening to hand out tickets for infractions.
If USC is aiming for rigid regulation, the administration should look to other cities with stricter approaches to bike safety. In Berlin, where biking is a common mode of transportation, sidewalks have been extended to include bike lanes and traffic lights have been installed at intersections specifically for bikers. All bikes have bells, which bicyclists ring when they approach pedestrians. They also have a system of enforcement: Minor biking infractions can cost more than $50.
At USC, there are now separate bike lanes, yet minimal enforcement. There is much less adherence to proper biking etiquette. The administration shouldn’t waver between Berlin-esque rules and a total lack of regulation, but should instead trust students to use their best judgment when biking. This requires the university to give students the freedom and trust they deserve and for students to take responsibility for their actions.
Students, as a result, could divert the energy invested in the bike debate toward issues more pertinent to student life, such as a fall break or an extended Thanksgiving vacation.
Bikes are a relatively frivolous matter in the day-to-day life of the average college student. They do help transport students from class to class or back to our dorms after a long night at Leavey Library, but students are not generally conscious of biking on and around campus.
Still, the administration continues to blow up the bike issue into a larger matter than it should be. Student Affairs has been quick to send emails regarding updates on the “We are Considerate.” campaign but has been more sparing in sending emails regarding other safety issues, such as armed robberies. The ongoing bike issue reveals how the priorities of the administration are not necessarily the priorities of the student body.
The best fix to USC’s bike problem is to take the magnifying glass away. Instead of implementing frivolous changes that seesaw between regulation and a lack thereof, the administration should give students the freedom to behave in the way we all know we can.

When I participated in the meeting in the spring about the new bicycle plan on campus, the proposal I had heard was that the bike lanes on Trousdale would have smooth pavement, while the pedestrian areas would have bricks or cobblestones, so that cyclists and pedestrians would automatically separate themselves.  When I was here over the summer, most of the pavement was torn up, so I assumed that they were going forward with this plan.
However, I see that in actuality, they have just redesigned the pavement in a way that does nothing to indicate the separated uses, and then applied a bit of paint as an afterthought.  If the proposal from the spring had been implemented, it seems that all the effort that goes into enforcement and awareness right now could have been directed to other issues.
However, it would seem like a waste to tear up all this pavement again just a few months after the last time it was replaced, so I suppose we’re stuck with the sub-optimal facilities at least for this current academic year.  Perhaps the metal barriers will start to be used, and the separation will work, but I’m not optimistic right now.
Maybe bikes are an issue.. but how about we prioritize. There are armed robberies and burglaries every week at and around USC. How about we focus on protecting USC students from violent felons before worrying about a biker being inconsiderate? Did we forget that two students got murdered just a few months ago?
We need to demand better from the administration in terms of safety. Stop cracking down on bikers and people partying, and instead put ALL of our DPS officers and resources into preventing violent crime. Enough of the excuses already. We pay 40,000 years and have a $3.3 BILLION dollar endowment. Use a fraction of that to protect our most valuable resource- our people.
I admit that I was walking down a bike lane earlier this week with a classmate and a DPS officer yelled at us and pointed to his left. It was literally, “HEY!” and him pointing. That honestly meant nothing to me as I had no clue why he was yelling or where he was pointing. When we got closer he yelled, “When I point like this it means get out of my bike lane!” Oh, there’s a bike lane now. That’s when we noticed the symbols of bikes and arrows painted on the ground and decided that the barriers that look like portable bike racks were, in fact, strange little barriers.
Now I’m sure the administration and fellow students will say I have no excuse for not knowing about the bike lanes because there were emails sent out. But I can tell you exactly why I didn’t read those emails: They weren’t addressed to me. They were addressed to bicyclists in terms of “bike lanes.” I’m a pedestrian and leave it to the bicyclists to know where they can ride and trust that they won’t run me over (now that’s not to say I don’t pay attention, but still). If the administration wants this all to work a little better, they should send a separate email announcing the new pedestrian walkways, too. This is a two-way street where the bicyclists are only half of the equation.
The school does spend way too much time on this issue and, I presume, way too much money dedicating DPS officers to its enforcement.
I would have to side with Administration in regards to this issue.  Administration cannot trust that bicycles will exercise common sense nor caution.  Simply for the reason that they have not, do not and will not exercise common sense nor caution.  Bicyclists fail to realize that they must abide by and are held to the same rules of the road as anyone who drives a vehicle.  However I would like Administration to consider increasing the 10 minutes allotted in between classes to 20 minutes.  Perhaps we wouldn’t need to race from one corner of campus to another.
Anyone who’s ever tried to cross Jefferson and Hoover at midday/walked on campus ever can testify to the fact that it’s an issue
“The administration should trust that students will exercise common sense and caution when biking on campus,”  but that’s the thing: they’ve shown again and again that they can’t be trusted to do so. Texting while on a bike is not an uncommon occurrence on campus. Same goes for bicyclists insisting on staying on their bike in areas congested with pedestrians, like in front of the Campus Center. Sometimes the pedestrians will be walking faster than the bike is going, but you still see people wobbling their tires unsteadily through the crowds. Where’s the common sense in that? And it’s not just bicyclists. Pedestrians are more free to text while mobile, but there are those who are so distracted (phone or no phone), they don’t notice they’re drifting in front of people. 
I do agree, though, that the bike lanes are not being as effective as they were intended to be. Some bicyclists completely ignore them, some pedestrians walk right down the middle of them. Those portable barriers are a mess and hardly recognizable as barriers at all. And sometimes bicyclists still have to walk their bike during peak hours even though they’re utilizing the bike lane. Those safety zones are only sometimes monitored so the inconsistency allows everyone to disregard the “rules” when they feel like it. 
Yes, there are other problems the administration could focus on, and yes the bike policies aren’t exactly the most sensical, but I don’t think the administration should be ignoring the bikes either. But they need to make some adjustments. There are great, aware, cautious bicyclists on campus, but they are overshadowed by those who are close to causing accidents, no matter how “inconsequential” they may be.
As a student, I totally disagree with this article. I think about bikes frequently as I worry about being mowed down by irresponsible riders who don’t follow regulations, or even worse, are talking on their cell phones and not paying attention to where they’re going. I know many of my peers also worry about this and other bike-related concerns. Since students have clearly demonstrated they don’t have the good judgement to ride their bikes in a safe manner, they shouldn’t be trusted to do so. I think the best solution would be to make campus a bike-free zone. Bikes are really only necessary for getting to and from campus from off-campus locations. Put guarded bike racks around the perimeter of campus for people to park at and make campus a pedestrian-only zone.

The installation of bike lanes along Trousdale Parkway is the university’s clever answer to USC’s ever-present bike safety problem. Installed at an optimal time — the beginning of a new school year — this is a solid first step toward a tangible solution to the hazards caused by the way students get around campus.
Robert Calcagno | Daily Trojan
Over the last few decades, as USC has transitioned from being a commuter campus to a more residential campus, students have turned to bikes as their choice of transportation. But the University Park Campus’ varied pathway sizes prove it was not designed to handle a lot of bike traffic.
Several proposed solutions to the problem of having too many bikes on campus are very unappealing — particularly those that would ban bike riding on campus — and reaching a compromise could allow pedestrians and cyclists to coexist on thoroughfares safely.
The current bike lanes, which could be effective in containing bike traffic and separating students from walking on the same path, already seem to have one problem. Though the university publicized the new bikes lanes thoroughly with emails and ads in the Daily Trojan, some parts of the lanes aren’t as clearly marked, as the medians are moveable and short. It’s easy for a pedestrian to accidentally wander into the area, even when Dept. of Public Safety officers are directing students to walk in the appropriate areas. It’s hard to tell right now if that will be a persistent problem or if longer barriers should be erected.
Otherwise, the lanes seem to work. As a former bicyclist on campus and a current walker, it’s easy to see that the lanes are wide enough for a cyclist to ride along Trousdale while keeping distracted drivers from mowing me over. Lanes similar to this one could be instituted in other areas of campus, possibly on streets like McClintock Avenue and other larger walkways, including Childs Way. Adding infrastructure that flexibly directs bike traffic can steadily alter the way cyclists and the general traffic flow move on campus.
With admitted exceptions, some Trojans are responsible bikers who follow the state’s laws for biking on public roads. Unfortunately, campus is a different place where students continuously break the law out of ignorance or disregard. Adding more structure to roads on campus will hopefully make bikers more aware of the rules they have to follow.
What else can the university do to get students to follow these rules, both on and off campus? This could include a well-designed regurgitation of L.A. and California biking laws presented to freshmen or students registering their bikes with DPS. Though it’s ultimately not the university’s responsibility to make sure students know how to ride a bike without breaking the law, it could help resolve a persistent problem on our campus.
This certainly isn’t a final solution to the bike problem, but it’s a good way to get the ball rolling. Main thoroughfares during rush hours are chaotic enough when massive quantities of pedestrians squeeze through areas in different directions, especially when those walking who aren’t in a hurry awkwardly block traffic to chat. Adding bikes to the mix has made congestion along USC’s busier walkways and intersections straight-up dangerous.
The Trousdale bike lane is the first physical change to campus to come from the “We are Considerate. We are USC.” campaign, and it’s a solid start to alleviating USC’s bike hazard problem.

Los Angelenos trying to get their live music fix this Labor Day weekend need to look no further than downtown LA, as the indie-centric FYF Fest returns to the Los Angeles State Historic Park this Saturday and Sunday.
Now in its ninth year, the festival is expanding to two consecutive days for the first time since moving to its current downtown location in 2009.
Although FYF has long been an ardent supporter of the Los Angeles punk scene, the lineup this year offers a wide variety of musical acts, including headliners ranging from French dream-pop outfit M83 to the worldly indie-rock band Beirut. Other top-billed acts include the newly reunited Swedish hardcore punk band Refused, Brooklyn noise-pop duo Sleigh Bells, indie-rock veterans The Faint and the psychedelic pop group Yeasayer.
Aside from the headliners, this year’s FYF boasts a strong undercard of up-and-coming acts drawn from a variety of locales and genres. Orange County’s own skate-punk group FIDLAR should put on one of the better shows of the weekend with their high-powered bursts of frenetic energy. Other highlights of the weekend include the San Francisco folk-rock duo Two Gallants, Cleveland noise-rock group Cloud Nothings and local punk band Joyce Manor.
For those looking for a quick break from the onslaught of music that the weekend will provide, the festival also includes a strong comedic lineup led by Arrested Development actor David Cross.
The festival grounds will include four stages of music and comedy, a vendor village, food trucks, two beer gardens and a VIP area.
Weekend passes are still available for $89 online at fyffest.com and at various record stores in the Los Angeles area.

Victor Wellington Peters, USC’s oldest alumnus who graduated in the class of 1924, died Aug. 12, according to USC News. He was 109.
After studying at the newly created University of California, Los Angeles campus for two years, Peters took a year off from school to build houses with his father in the nearby area. He returned to his studies in 1922 across town at USC and graduated with a bachelor degree in fine arts two years later.
Soon after, he earned a degree from Princeton’s Theological Seminary and embarked on a 13-year-long missionary trip to Seoul, Korea. There, he met and married his wife Ruth.
Peters returned to the United States during World War II and worked in Los Angeles for the remainder of his life. He was involved in a wide range of activities, which included working as a pastor at local churches, a teacher at Azusa College and an artist for an L.A. printing company.
In 2006, Peters gifted the letters he sent to his family while in Korea to USC’s Korean Heritage Library, where they were digitized and put online. He browsed through this library on his last trip to USC in 2010.
He is survived by four children, Grace, Margaret, Elona and Mel. He is also survived by eight grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.

Has anyone had the chance to see the Matt Barkley billboard on the intersection of Westwood Boulevard and Lindbrook Drive recently? No? Me neither. No one has.
This billboard, featuring Barkley looking to the sky, was painted over early Tuesday morning. All that remains is a black background.
As USC spokesperson Tim Tessalone told ESPN Los Angeles, USC does not agree nor were they involved with the decision to cover the billboard. While the advertisement appeared in UCLA territory, UCLA claims no responsibility for the cover-up either. Regardless of who made it, however, the decision is unjustified, and only caters to bad sportsmanship on the part of UCLA fans.
The erection of the billboard in Westwood was never meant to taunt the Bruins. As Craig Kelley, an associate athletic director for marketing at USC, told the Los Angeles Times, Westwood and Lindbrook was simply a favorable location.
“We chose the … [locations] … that would work best for us at the time based on what was available,” he said.
The billboard was part of an ad campaign that projected a positive message for all athletes, and was directed at everyone—not just UCLA. The campaign included another 29 billboards which were put up in the Los Angeles area—none of which were taken down or tampered with—and another advertisement is set to go up in Time’s Square this Saturday.
“It’s a positive,” said Kelley, about the billboard’s message. “That’s really what that board is about: Finishing what you start. That crosses all platforms and all schools.”
Since USC obviously did not deface their own billboard, the responsible party remains a mystery. Naturally, some suspect that this is retaliation by disgruntled UCLA fans for USC’s 50-0 manhandling of their team.
There has also been some speculation that the company who erected the billboard, Regency Outdoor Advertising, may have chosen to take it down. Despite being Trojan alumni and big time donors to the school, flaunting UCS’s superiority in front of potential customers may be poor business practice.
Whatever the case, no party but USC had the right to cover that billboard, and no one should have covered it.
There is no taunting or disrespect in that billboard. If that’s how you interpreted it, then you need to thicken your skin (yeah that’s right j & david). It’s a prime spot and was purely coincidental. If it was meant to taunt our rival, then a bombastic–50-0–would’ve been plastered on it. It was banter if that.
The billboard was distasteful at best and a NCAA violation at worst.  Just getting off sanctions we should know better than to do something so publicly stupid.  It’s surprising that the Athletic department was not more alarmed that an independent part had hijacked its name and likeness to post as taunts at UCLA’s campus.  If I were the A.D. heads would have rolled.
You are wrong. 
The billboard was clearly provocative and inappropriate. This shoving of USC in everyones face all  the time is unseemly at best and down right distastefull at worst.
Sometimes I long for the days when we let our actions do the talking and did not feel the need to huckster our school at every opportunity. Let’s take some of the for sale signs down and simply take pride in who we are and what we do without having to advertise ourselves 24/7. Frankly, I prefer the Sample way of doing things with a quiet rectitude in place of the in-your-face self serving self promoting dogma that characterizes the present administration.

During Saturday’s season opener against the Hawaii Warriors, USC will honor deceased All-Pro linebacker and former Trojan Junior Seau by distributing upwards of 80,000 wristbands in remembrance of his life and football career.
The wristbands say “Trojan Pride 55,” a reference to Seau’s jersey number while a member of USC’s football team.
Seau passed away this year on May 2 at the age of 43. His death was later confirmed as a suicide. An autopsy performed in August did not reveal any football related injuries to the brain.
Seau played at USC for two seasons, amassing 19 sacks in his junior year alone while playing for a 9-2-1 Trojan squad that defeated Michigan to win the 1989 Rose Bowl. He was the fifth pick in the first round of the 1990 NFL draft, selected by the San Diego Chargers. He played for the Chargers for 12 years before moving to the Miami Dolphins and eventually the New England Patriots. In all, Seau’s NFL career spanned 20 seasons. He was a six-time All-Pro selection and played in 12 Pro Bowls. He was inducted into USC’s ring of honor in 2008 and is also a member of San Diego’s ring of honor.
In addition to the free wristbands expected to be passed out Saturday, a new website, www.trojanpride55.com, in honor of Seau’s contributions on and off the field was recently launched. The site allows fans to post tweets about Seau and also donate money for investigating sports-related brain injuries.

When the number of scholarships allotted for a college football team is cut down by sanctions, as USC has experienced these past two seasons, it can be hard for special teams players like senior Kyle Negrete to earn one of those precious free rides through school — especially when there’s already a scholarship punter on the roster.
Directional punting · In 2011, Negrete placed 19 of his 39 punts inside the opponents’ 20-yard line without recording a touchback. – Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
Redshirt freshman punter Kris Albarado has held one of USC’s coveted 75 football scholarships since he arrived on campus last fall, and with the scholarship reductions caused by the team’s probation, it seemed unlikely that the Trojans would be able to give another one to a second punter.
But last week, USC coach Lane Kiffin announced that Negrete, who had been a walk-on since transferring from San Diego in 2010, had defied the odds. This season he will punt without having to pay a dime for his USC education.
It’s been an uphill battle for Negrete, whose father paid for his USC education as he effectively punted for free last year. Throughout this offseason, he had to battle Albarado for the starting punting job after the two were listed as co-starters in the spring.
“It’s fun to come into camp and have to compete,” Negrete said. “I love having the question mark. That’s what we sign up for as a Trojan.”
You won’t hear him complaining. Not after all he’s been through.
Before every practice and game, Negrete writes “5/17/02” on his left arm to commemorate his mother, Patty, who passed away on that date from breast cancer.
Since then, he has worked to honor her memory.
“Just seeing the way my mom battled, in the last couple weeks of her life … that’s something that really fuels me,” Negrete said. “The fire in my eyes when I’m out here working and training — that’s where that comes from.”
Even if Negrete doesn’t play a snap for the Trojans this season, he’s already accomplished enough off the field to make any mother proud.
Soon after Patty Negrete’s death, Kyle and his family founded the “Patty Project,” a nonprofit that pairs adult mentors with inner-city elementary school children near Fresno, Calif.
“Since I was young, I’ve been taught to give back, to feed the needy and serve the poor,” Negrete said. “It’s just a part of the way that I was raised, having that servant’s heart.”
While he was at San Diego, Negrete founded “Best Buddies,” a mentoring program for student-athletes to spend time with people with autism.
In 2010, he spent his winter break with quarterback Matt Barkley in Nigeria doing service work.
This past spring break, he and 15 of his teammates traveled to Haiti to build houses for those still recovering from the destructive earthquake that hit the island in January 2010.
Negrete says that the 16 Trojans who traveled were the leaders and core foundation of the team, and Barkley says that Negrete is included in that group of leaders.
“He’s a punter, but he does have a voice,” Barkley said. “He’s not always the center of attention on the field, but he carries himself in a manner as if he’s a starting linebacker or running back, because he has that kind of poise and character.”
In July, Negrete was one of 52 Football Bowl Subdivision athletes nominated for the Allstate AFCA Good Works Team, which honors college football players who are committed to making a difference in their communities. A committee will pare that list down to 11 award recipients in September.
“It’s fun to have that labeled with you because I think it’s a great award,” Negrete said. “[But] I don’t do the things that I do for recognition.”
Negrete hasn’t been nationally recognized yet for his work on the gridiron, but if he improves his numbers from last year, it’ll be hard for pundits to ignore him.
Last season, 19 of Negrete’s 39 punts pinned opponents within their own 20-yard lines, but not one went into the end zone for a touchback. That 19:0 ratio was the best of any punter in the nation.
His 40.1-yard average left something to be desired, though, and Albarado’s powerful leg threatened to take away the punting job in the offseason. Negrete worked to improve his leg strength in the offseason, and he’s confident that he’s the best man for the job, albeit a job the Trojans are hoping they won’t have to do too often.
When Kiffin announced that Negrete had earned a scholarship, he added that Negrete hadn’t yet sewn up the starting job.
“I had to earn my spot [two years ago], and that’s the same place that I’m at now,” Negrete said. “I love that stuff. That’s why we come here, and that’s why a lot of people don’t — because they don’t want to compete; they want everything to be handed to them. Here [at USC], you have to earn everything.”
No matter what happens this season, it’s safe to say Negrete has not only earned his scholarship but also the respect his teammates afford him as a leader on a team with no shortage of superstars.
“He’s done more around here than a number of our guys on scholarship,” Kiffin said.

USC coach Lane Kiffin announced Sunday that media members would no longer be allowed to report practice injuries of any sort, saying it put USC at a competitive disadvantage.
So the general public will no longer know which Trojans sat out practice, which ones appeared to be hurt or which ones spent their day on the trainer’s table getting back massages.
It’s debatable whether or not this decision will actually help USC. But there’s no question that it comes because of the extreme impact that injuries could have on the Trojans this year.
Thanks to the scholarship restrictions imposed on the team, they’ll run out onto the field for every game with 10 fewer scholarship players than their opponents.
That might not sound like a big deal, since the Trojans still have 75 talented players.
But if the injury bug bites the team, it could be a serious roadblock on the way to the BCS national championship — something Kiffin won’t want any opponents to know about until they’re standing opposite the Cardinal and Gold on game day.
Though Kiffin has taken great pains to limit live-tackling during practices because of reduced numbers, key USC players have still suffered injuries both in practice and games.
Senior quarterback Matt Barkley has suffered two injuries that caused him to miss two games in his college career — one at Washington in 2009 and another against Notre Dame in 2010. Both resulted in USC defeats.
Last season against Stanford, linebacker and leading tackler Dion Bailey was forced out of the game after sustaining a concussion with USC up 56-48 in the third overtime.
Three plays later, quarterback Andrew Luck lofted a touchdown pass right over linebacker Tre Madden — Bailey’s replacement — to tie the game and send it into triple overtime.
USC is ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press preseason poll, so naturally, there are plenty of reasons to expect a successful 2012 campaign from the Cardinal and Gold.
The squad’s defense improved in its second year under assistant head coach and defensive guru Monte Kiffin, allowing 23.6 points per game after giving up 26.7 points per game in 2010, and could take another step up in its third year in Kiffin’s intricate Tampa 2 system.
And of course, much has been said about the return of Barkley and top receivers Robert Woods and Marqise Lee, a trio that seems poised to break all of Troy’s passing and receiving records.
Unfortunately, there are some shallow areas with depth issues that could be exposed over the course of the season.
In 2010, USC’s rushing defense struggled without a marquee defender in the center of the defensive line, giving up an average of 4.4 yards per rush.
That number improved to 3.6 yards per rush in 2011 with the return of two-year senior starter Christian Tupou.
But with Tupou and first round draft pick Nick Perry gone from the defensive line, the Trojans have few upperclassmen defensive linemen on scholarship. Redshirt sophomore George Uko and redshirt freshman Antwaun Woods, the tabbed starters, are taking on increased roles this year.
If either of them goes down, concerns about USC’s rush defense could resurface.
And, even though the Trojan offensive line should function like a well-oiled machine with the return of four starters, Arizona State proved last season that a blitz-heavy scheme can force the unit into making mistakes — which disrupts Barkley and the entire offense.
Barkley’s 2011 Heisman campaign was essentially derailed after turning the ball over three times in a 43-22 loss to the Sun Devils, who collected two sacks and two interceptions against Barkley amid windy conditions at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Ariz.
The loss of All-American left tackle Matt Kalil to the NFL Draft won’t help hold back any of that defensive pressure.
In their first season back from bowl exile, the Trojans have an immense amount of pressure on them to succeed in what will serve as both Kiffin’s defining third season as head coach and the end to Barkley’s storied USC career.
Fair or not, with all the lofty preseason expectations heaped on the squad, success will be defined by earning a berth in the BCS championship game, which means at least one win over the Ducks.
Bumps and bruises are bound to accumulate over the season. How the Trojans respond to those setbacks will dictate how they perform.
Though the media won’t be allowed to report on injuries, Kiffin of course won’t be able to ignore their effects when his team steps onto the field.

Fans of the Pac-12 now have another way to watch their favorite schools compete — anytime, anywhere.
The Pac-12 Enterprises announced Wednesday that subscribers to their new television network will also be able to get the programming on mobile devices.
Depth concerns · Last year against Stanford, sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey suffered a concussion, costing USC’s defense a top tackler. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“Today is a game changer in our ability to deliver our content to Pac-12 fans,” said Gary Stevenson, the president of Pac-12 Enterprises, in a statement. “We look forward to putting this technology in the hands of more fans across the country as the college football season unfolds.”
Through the Pac-12 Now application, currently available on the iPad and available on the iPhone and Android operating systems in the next couple of months, customers receiving the station through their normal cable provider will be able to type in their subscription number on a mobile device and stream content.
“With Pac-12 Now for iPad, we are one step closer to achieving our goal of connecting fans with our live programming and feature content when and where they choose to access it,” Stevenson said.
Not all football fans can currently enjoy the network, though. The Pac-12 Networks are available through Cox, Bright House and Time Warner Cable; customers of Charter, DirecTV and Comcast are still without the station.
“We’re working as quickly as possible with our affiliate partners to expand the availability of Pac-12 Now,” Stevenson said.
The app’s first wave of programming will include the San Diego State at Washington and Nevada at California games. The station launched on Aug. 15 and is now available through USC cable on channel 12-1.
