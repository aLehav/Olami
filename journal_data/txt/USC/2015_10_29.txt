After suffering a tough one-goal loss at Pacific last weekend, the No. 3-ranked USC men’s water polo team will seek to rebound on the road at No. 4 Cal on Saturday morning.
The Trojans fell 8-7 to the Tigers on Oct. 25 in a tight game throughout. Pacific went ahead by two goals late in the fourth and while the Trojans pulled back within one on a Blake Edwards penalty shot, they were unable to equalize.
It was the Trojans’ first MPSF loss of the season – they had been 5-0 in division play prior to the match – as they fell one spot in the national rankings.
Edwards, who notched two goals in the match, leads the Trojans in scoring with 53 goals, and Grant Stein, also with two tallies, is next with 32. They are just a few of the potent options the Trojans have in their top-ranked offense that is averaging 15.8 goals per game. Goalkeeper McQuin Baron heads a strong USC defense that is second in the MPSF in defense, allowing just 5.55 goals per game.
“We’ve got to make sure – after [the loss to Pacific] – we don’t dwell on it,” Stein said. “We’ve got to be prepared for Cal this weekend. We’re not trying to focus on that loss. We’re trying to push forward and focus on what’s coming up in the future.”
The Bears also boast just one in-conference defeat, falling to tight-ranked UCLA in a close game. However, they came back the next day and beat Long Beach State 15-14 in double overtime.
“It’s going to be a really difficult game,” Edwards said. “They’re playing some really good water polo at the moment. We’re coming off a loss so everyone’s fired up, focused and excited.”
Cal is led by Johnny Hooper with 54 goals, followed by Odysseas Masmanidis with 45 tallies. The Bears have scored 297 goals while allowing just 168 by opponents; goalkeeper Lazar Andric is averaging 8.45 goals-against per game.
One key will be how USC fends off Cal’s potent counterattack.
“They’re one of the quickest teams in the league,” Stein said. “That’s a big part of it. It comes from focus on offense. No early, quick, stupid shots that we’ve done in the past — just making sure we know who’s guarding us so that we’re not surprised by their counterattack.”
Another is following the game plan, which the Trojans struggled to do at Pacific.
“Last week against Pacific we didn’t follow the game plan at all and we made too many errors,” Edwards said. “We need to go back to the basics, play good defense and be ready for their counterattack.”
Earlier this season, the Trojans defeated the Bears 12-7 in the third-place game of the NorCal Invitational behind 14 saves from McBaron.
“[McBaron} had a great game,” Stein said. “We had a slow start in that game, but as the game carried on we picked it up. We came out with a lot of fire and intensity.”
All-time, USC is 58-53-2 against Cal.
With these teams separated by just one spot in the rankings, the result of this game will have ramifications atop the MPSF standings.
This match caps off a three-game road trip for the Trojans, who will return home next week to take on UC Irvine.

The Environmental Student Assembly and the USC Schwarzenegger Institute hosted author and environmentalist Per Espen Stoknes Thursday afternoon for a conversation about how students can help address the problem of climate change.
Stoknes, an international award-winning author and psychologist, told USC students that the best ways they can raise public awareness about the prevalence of environmental changes is by personalizing the problem.  Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger echoed his remarks.
“We know we have to communicate in a way where people feel they can take part and make an impact in this environmental crusade,” Schwarzenegger said.
Schwarzenegger added that people shouldn’t rely on the federal government to spur this movement, but rather, localize the problem by focusing on visible examples like garbage on the streets, smog in the air and runoff in our oceans, would inspire more people to help.

“I think in California we did a great job of always including the people and making them aware,” Schwarzenegger said.
He enforced the idea that politicians need to portray climate problem as something we can all benefit, and even profit, from.
“We all, as people, really have to get together and have a movement going so that everyone personalizes this issue and does his or her share to get us toward a greener and more renewable future,” Schwarzenegger said.
Stoknes’s most recent book, What We Think About When We Try Not to Think About Global Warming, discusses segments of the population that largely disregard the mounting scientific evidence that supports global warming. Similarly, Stoknes’ lecture at USC expressed innovative ways that anyone who cares about this issue, including college students, can “change the narrative,” so that others can start seeing that helping the environment is not only beneficial for the world, but also to them.

In order to do this, Stoknes talked about creating a movement similar to that of Martin Luther King Jr., where African American citizens protested against centuries of systematic racism. Stoknes said that, like King’s fight, which he called “the idea of the century,” climate change needed to create a “dream,” in order to make change.
One of the ways Stoknes tries to shift public perspective on climate change is by creating a brighter view of the future. He said that people are often discouraged by the multitude of disheartening facts about the environment portrayed in the media and by academics, and that providing a positive outlook on the future would encourage more people to get involved.

“What we need is a better story about the future.” Stoknes said. “When 6 percent of Americans believe that global warming is a solvable problem, 94 percent believe that it is not solvable. And because they believe it’s not solvable, people try not to think about it. So if you are faced with hell, what do you do? We need to sell a dream, and we know what effect King’s had.”
Stoknes added that those who support further environmental legislation shouldn’t have to the defend their position, despite claims that the costs associated with improving carbon efficiency in factories would result to less U.S. manufacturing jobs and more outsourcing. Rather, Stoknes cited recent efforts in energy efficient countries such as Denmark that have experienced a 5 percent growth in the past decade as examples of another personal incentive to help — that it can be profitable.

“I would counter that by talking about the narrative of smarter growth,” Stoknes said. “Smart investors are moving money towards energy efficient solutions, and the story we need to tell people is how we’re building the cities of the future so that we can be just as, and if not more productive, while leaving a significantly smaller carbon footprint. California has recently shown the world that it is not only smart, but profitable.”
Stoknes, who discussed localizing the issue of climate change, said that bringing awareness to college campuses would influence students to take this “lifestyle” and promote it among their own peers. He said that the USC community, which has already fostered an ethos of caring for the local population, could promote environmental awareness by emphasizing simple tasks like recycling, posting pictures of trash on social media or even supplying biodegradable solo cups at parties.

“I love USC because they believe that they should have an influence not only on the future of Los Angeles and California, but the future of all of the world,” Schwarzenegger said. “This is why they reach out to institutions from all over the world to get spectacular speakers like Stoknes and have the most amount of foreign students of any university in America. We want to have students from China going to school here so when they go back, they can be future leaders, who can implement the things that we’ve prioritized here — like doing their part to help the environment. We know it’s a global economy now and we’re all in this together.”
Stoknes ended his presentation saying that if there is going to be meaningful change, there has to be more unified movement, and that in order to do so, the narrative has to be changed from images of droughts, flash flooding and melting icebergs, to facts about the progress we can all enjoy if we do our part to help.
“All of the climate change is displayed within the framing of catastrophe. And of much doom.” Stoknes said. “I think that it has caused a fatigue that has started the stereotype that these problems are too far and out of our control. But really, we all need to help more than ever.”

On Thursday morning, the Bedrosian Center of the Price School of Public Policy hosted former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino at Town and Gown for an installment of the Holt lecture series. Hosted by Bedrosian Center Director Raphael Bostic, the lecture covered Perino’s background as a press secretary, her thoughts on politics and the evolution of digital journalism.
Bostic started the event by describing Perino’s long résumé, including her roles as co-host of the Fox News show The Five, White House Press Secretary during the George W. Bush administration and New York Times best-selling author.
Perino used the first half of the lecture to discuss her background and comment on her experiences in the political and journalism worlds. Speaking of her time at the White House, she said she was comfortable with her role “behind the scenes” until former press secretary Tony Snow asked her to fill in when he was diagnosed with cancer. She said her role as press secretary taught her about “nobility in public service” and said that when working in any major institution, it is easy to acquire a large ego.
“When you work in any organization, but especially the White House, there is a risk that you can get a big head about it and form White House-itis,” Perino said.
Perino said she learned from her former Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr. to “realize the humility of public service” and that it was important to know that “you are working on behalf of the citizens of the United States of America.”
When speaking on her political experience, she described the large range of contacts she gained in Washington, including professional contacts across many national governmental departments, to fulfill her role as press secretary. Perino also highlighted her experiences with those across the political aisle as well, noting many Democratic connections she had made in Washington.
“I had friends from both sides of the aisle, It was a great career opportunity, which enhanced my life,” she said. “I never thought about myself as spokesperson for the Republican Party — absolutely not. I was spokesperson for the United States of America.”
Recalling a trip in which she traveled with President Bush to Iraq, Perino described an infamous situation in which a shoe was thrown at the president. During the chaos, she was hit in the eye with a boom pole resulting in a black eye. Upon her return to Air Force One, Perino said none of the press took her photo due to the respect they had developed for her during her tenure. Perino recalls their actions as those of great civility and an approach we should take in politics in general.
“Having that kind of relationship with the press, that they would protect you personally, is something that we should all strive to do,” she said. “We live in the greatest country in the world, and yes, we can have discussions and big debates, but we really need to start remembering that we are all pulling for the same thing. We may just have different ideas on how to get there.”
Perino mentioned the role of Twitter and social media in modern journalism. She described her experience with digital media as a “love-hate relationship.” Perino said the rise of digital media created a large change in the journalism field which produced an awkward yet worthwhile transition.
“I started as press secretary in 1995, and I worked [in Washington] through 2008, so I saw big change [in journalism.] When I first heard about Twitter I thought, ‘Oh God, I don’t need to do that, who has time for Twitter?’ I would always get frustrated that reporters would want to get the story out first and ask questions later.” she said. “The great thing about Twitter is that there is now a peer pressure check. I think that that is improving [journalism] and will continue to do so.”
Perino said her experience with Twitter made her more receptive to other forms of social media.
“Another example is Snapchat … the numbers of young people following the debates on Snapchat is in the tens of millions,” she said. “Because of my [prior] skepticism with Twitter, I’m trying to not be a Neanderthal when it comes to things like Snapchat.”
Kyle Abbott, a senior majoring in policy, planning and development, noted Perino’s ability to steer a conversation.
“I was really impressed with her ability to handle the Republican-Democrat dichotomy,” Abbott said. “I was also impressed with Perino’s ability to connect with everyone in the audience at the same time.”

Few people live and breathe football the way that Nick Pappas, former USC football player, coach and associate athletic director, did. Pappas, who passed away on Friday at the age of 99, left behind a long legacy of commitment to both the school and the sport.
Nicknamed “Mr. Trojan” for his unwavering passion for USC, Pappas embodied the qualities of a leader and a team player during his 59 years with the University, according to Sports Information Director Tim Tessalone.
“Nobody loved USC more or did more for the University and its athletic program, particularly its football team, than Nick,” Tessalone said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “His length of service to USC was amazing.”
Pappas was born in Seattle in 1916, and started his football career as a tailback for the Trojans in 1935, where for three years, he led the team in rushing under coach Howard Jones. After graduating from the University, he briefly played for the Hollywood Bears before returning to USC in 1939 to coach the freshman team.
Pappas’s dedication extended off the field and into his service overseas as a member of the Navy during World War II. During the Battle of Okinawa, he distinguished himself by earning a Silver Star for heroism in battle. In 1945, he received a Purple Heart after his destroyer, the USS Drexler, fell under attack by Japanese kamikaze pilots and sank into the Pacific. Pappas, who was blown into the water, swam into the burning wreckage of the ship to rescue two fellow sailors.
After the end of the war, Pappas spent several years as a pro football scout before returning to the University to scout for the Trojans. He was named an assistant coach under Jess Hill in 1953, a position that helped him lead the Trojans to the Rose Bowl in 1955.
Though Pappas worked to support the University while he was coaching there, he also took steps to ensure that its athletic programs would exist long after his tenure there was over. When he established the Trojan Club athletic booster organization in the late 1950s, it was unique among universities.
“He was an innovator,” Tessalone said. “He was well ahead of his time in establishing the Trojan Club, which became a model athletic fundraising program for universities throughout the nation.”
The Trojan Club survives today as the USC Trojan Boosters, a group dedicated to athletic fundraising that is focused on building relationships between the University and its donors. Though Pappas retired in 1981, he continued his work with the Trojan Club, raising endowment funds for the University until 2004. As a result, he was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997. Upon his retirement, he was the longest tenured employee at USC, for which he received USC’s Alumni Service Award.
The story of Pappas’s life crosses local, state and national borders, but it always comes back to football. In 1940, Pappas made his film debut as a stunt double for Pat O’Brien in the biopic Knute Rockne, All American, which memorialized the story of Notre Dame’s legendary coach and also featured Ronald Reagan in a starring role. Though brief, Pappas’s contribution was inspired by what he loved best: playing football.
Pappas is survived by his daughters, Lisa Widman and Mona Pappas, five grandchildren and many great-grandchildren. His wife of 66 years, Deedy, passed away in 2006, followed by his daughter Rene Arrobio in 2009. He will be missed by the USC community, which, according to Tessalone, would not be the same without the passion and effort that Pappas brought to the University.
“Everything that Nick did, he did it with USC’s best interest in mind,” Tessalone said. “There is only one Nick Pappas, and he will be deeply missed by everyone in the Trojan Family.”
It would have been nice to name the people in the picture with Coach McKay especially Nick Pappas.

USC unveiled a $270 million renovation plan for the Coliseum Thursday. The renovation, the first in 20 years, will be finished in time for the 2019 season.
The Coliseum has been a defining feature of USC and the greater Los Angeles Area since its construction in 1923.
In the summer of 2013, the Coliseum Commission and the Board of Directors for the California Science Center gave approval for the renovations.
Noteworthy renovations include entirely new seating, which will feature increased legroom and widened seats, handrails throughout the stadium, a new press box, suites, loge boxes, club seats, concourse, a club box, a Wi-Fi update and two additional large screens.
“This needed renovation to a stadium built in 1923 will ensure that the gameday experience gives all fans options to enjoy the stadium’s new amenities while recognizing the loyalty of our long-time fans,” said Athletic Director Pat Haden in a press release. “It also will provide our football team with a first-class facility and a home field advantage.”
Athletics will fund the renovations with capital gifts, events not affiliated with USC, donor-naming and sponsorship revenue.
By completing these renovations, USC is obligating its lease agreement with the state, Los Angeles County and the city of Los Angeles in which USC must invest $100 million by 2054.
With new, widened seats and increased legroom, the Coliseum’s capacity will decrease from 93,607 to 77,500.
This is not the first time in USC history that the Coliseum has been renovated. In 1993, the field was lowered; in 1994, the stadium was repaired following an earthquake; and in 1995, the press box was added.
“The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is a treasure not just for Los Angeles but for the state of California, and its renovation is long overdue,” said President C. L. Max Nikias in a press release. “We believe these renovations will strengthen the Coliseum’s reputation as one of the world’s great venues, and also will enhance our world-class athletic programs that utilize the Coliseum.”

After two days of negotiations, the Service Employees International Union, the labor union representing USC custodial staff, has reached an agreement about the workers’ labor contract with their employer, Aramark. USC service workers will be voting on whether or not to accept the terms of the new labor contract on Saturday at the SEIU headquarters.
The negotiations, which concluded Wednesday night after months of back-and-forth dialogue, had focused strictly on economic issues, such as workers’ wages and health care benefits, for the past several days. Janitors, represented by their union, are asking for wages at least $1.50 above the minimum wage, according to SEIU spokesman Edmundo Garcia. The terms of the new contract have not been released to the public.
Representatives from USC, which subcontracts its custodial staff through Aramark, were not present at the negotiations. Rallies on campus in August and earlier this week have urged the University to intervene by pressuring Aramark to meet the janitors’ demands, despite not being their direct employer.
The vote, which was originally set for Friday, was postponed in order to allow the maximum number of workers to attend, according to Garcia.
If workers decide to reject the terms of the contract, they will also take a vote to decide whether or not to go on strike. Garcia, however, told the Daily Trojan that he is hopeful for a positive and cooperative outcome.
Janitors have been negotiating with Aramark since their contract expired in June. According to Garcia, working without a contract is dangerous, because the workers lack a written guarantee of their wages and working conditions.
“Workers that have a contract are going to have fewer issues at the work site, because the parameters are set,” Garcia said. “There’s not an arbitrary, subjective decision-making by a supervisor. Everybody knows what they’re going to be getting – I think that’s fair.”

Carrying on tradition · Interim head coach Clay Helton became the eighth consecutive coach to win his debut at the Coliseum after the Trojans 42-24 rout of No. 3-ranked and Pac-12 South leader Utah last Saturday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
After snapping a two game losing streak at home to No. 3 Utah, the Trojans travel north to face NFL prospect Jared Goff and the Cal Golden Bears.
The Trojans improved to 4-3 with last week’s win, while the Bears have lost their last two games after beginning the season undefeated, dropping to 5-2.
The game will come down to a battle of the quarterbacks. USC is led by redshirt senior Cody Kessler while the Bears are led by Goff, a true junior.
Both are three year starters. Goff is 10th in the nation in passing yards per game with 323.6 and is tied for ninth in touchdown passes with 20. Kessler is 18th with 297.4 yards and tied for 11th with 18 touchdowns, respectively.
“It’s going to be very competitive obviously … but at the end of the day, I’ve known Jared for a while now,” Kessler said. “We’re good friends. We’re going to be buddies no matter what happens.”
Goff has completed 65.5 percent of his passes this season, throwing for 2,265 yards this season. Though Goff already has 20 touchdown passes this season, he has also thrown nine interceptions.
Five of those interceptions came in Cal’s first loss of the season when they fell 30-24. They went on to lose the following game to UCLA.
Despite Goff’s five interceptions, he kept his team in the game through the final drive, and the Bears almost went 6-0 before Josh Rosen and the Bruins handed them their first beatdown of the season.
Goff began the season as a Heisman hopeful and an NFL prospect, and though he is no longer in the running for the Heisman, he is still a top quarterback prospect.
“Unbelievable anticipatory thrower, in my opinion,” interim head coach Clay Helton said. “You can tell he’s been around that receiving corps for a while. They’re on the same page. He throws guys open. He has no fear. He is able to fit balls into tight windows. There’s two NFL quarterbacks on that field Saturday. It should be fun.”
Goff’s 20 touchdown passes are not only a result of his arm strength, but also of the talent at wide receiver.
Junior wide receiver Kenny Lawler has nine touchdowns on 39 receptions and 497 yards. His 6-foot-3 frame makes him a favorite in the red zone. Lawler is one of four Cal receivers with at least 400 yards this season.
Goff will face a Trojan defense that is coming off a record performance against No. 3 Utah. Freshman linebacker Cameron Smith intercepted Utah quarterback Travis Wilson three times.
Goff is typically an accurate passer with a lot of poise, but as he demonstrated against Utah, can get rattled and start making bad reads. The key for the defense will be to force Cal to run the ball and make Goff a non-factor.
After playing mainly on offense against Utah, sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson will switch back to defense against Cal.
“It will be a game-to-game plan in terms of how we use him,” Helton said. “Last week was more of a run-oriented offense we faced, but this week is a passing offense, so I anticipate him playing more on defense this weekend.”
On offense, Kessler will rely on his experience to lead his team past Cal. Though Goff’s 6-foot-5 stature and his arm strength make him a better quarterback on paper, Kessler’s poise in the pocket makes up for what he lacks in height.
Kessler leads an offense that has been greatly depleted by injury, especially on the offensive line and its wide receving corps.
Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster is fifth in the nation in receptions with 128.7 yards per game and has five games with over 100 yards.
There isn’t a lot of depth behind him, however, as junior Isaac Whitney is out indefinitely with a broken collarbone and Steven Mitchell Jr. is ruled as questionable with an ankle injury. Darreus Rogers has been upgraded to probable after recovering from a hamstring injury.
Kessler will need Smith-Schuster to continue making big plays and picking up yards after the catch, and he’ll need the run game to continue to be unstoppable. Justin Davis  and Tre Madden have been a dangerous one-two punch on the ground to complement Kessler and Smith-Schuster in the air.
If the Trojans click the way they did against Utah, the Goff and the Bears will have their hands full. Cal is a solid team, however, and will be eager to snap a two game losing streak at home.
Kick off is set for 12:30 p.m. at the California Memorial Stadium. It will be aired live on FOX.

Built Ford tough · Freshman outside hitter Alyse Ford has emerged as a force for the Women of Troy offense, averaging just under three kills per set. – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
The No. 1-ranked USC women’s volleyball team (22-0, 10-0 Pac-12) is back on the road this weekend, starting the second half of their conference schedule by visiting No. 5-ranked Washington (18-2, 8-2) on Friday in Seattle before heading over to the Palouse to face Washington State (14-8, 3-7) on Sunday.
The Women of Troy are the lone undefeated team in the nation and are off to the fourth best start in program history. However, head coach Mick Haley knows that winning streak will be put to the test against the Huskies and the Cougars.
“It’s a hard schedule this year going to the Pacific Northwest back to back. We just got back from Oregon, and now we’re off to Seattle,” Haley said. “And it’s always a trap game when you play Washington first and you go to Pullman second, so you really have to be on your game to win two on the road this weekend.”
After two road victories against the Oregon schools last week, USC will square off in a rematch against another top-5 opponent in Washington. The last time these two teams met, USC pulled out a thrilling 3-1 victory at the Galen Center and snapped the Huskies’ 13-match winning streak. Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio had 27 kills and three aces to lead USC in that match, while fellow senior Alicia Ogoms added 12 kills and six blocks.
Playing in Seattle has been a different story, however, as Alaska Airlines Arena has not been kind to the Women of Troy. USC has gone just 1-9 over the last 10 games in Seattle, dating back to 2004.
“They’re chomping at the bit to get back at us, and it’ll be their home match, so we’ll have to be really good,” Haley said. “I think this is probably going to be one of the more important matches of the year for both teams.”
Playing Washington State on Sunday will also be a challenge for USC, as the Cougars have pushed the Women of Troy to five sets in Pullman in each of the last two years.
“Washington State always plays well at home, and they always play us tough. We would expect nothing less than their best efforts,” Haley said.
Still, the Women of Troy lead the all-time series, 47-13, and have won 9 of the last 10 meetings.
The fast-paced Women of Troy offense will be headlined by the reigning Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week in Bricio, who leads USC with 5.07 kills per set and 0.76 aces per set. She has also found a formidable counterpart in freshman Alyse Ford, who has come on strong as of late. The 5-foot-10 pin hitter has strung together a number of impressive matches over the last three weeks and upped her season averages to 2.99 kills per set, second highest on the team, with a .299 hitting percentage.
On defense, USC will be led by Ogoms and junior libero Taylor Whittingham, both of whom lead the Pac-12 with 1.58 blocks per set and 5.11 digs per set, respectively.
Friday’s match against No. 5 Washington will tip off at 8 p.m. and will air on the Pac-12 Networks, while Sunday’s match against Washington State is set for 12:30 p.m.

The two sports that dictate the culture of most college athletic programs have always been — and always will be — football and men’s basketball.
At the University of Southern California, the history and tradition of the football program speaks for itself — 11 national titles, seven Heisman trophy winners and nearly 500 players selected in the NFL Draft. Clearly, a football powerhouse, though, that notion has been put into question as of late.
Then, on the other end of the spectrum, you have USC men’s basketball, whose season opener is right around the corner. When you’re speaking about the two respective programs’ histories over the past 25 years, you couldn’t have two more polar opposites. Not even the wide gap in the ideologies of the Democratic and Republican parties can trump the void between USC football and men’s basketball.
Since 1990, the Trojans’ football team has won two AP national championships and five Rose Bowls, and has finished at the top of the Pac-12 Conference an astounding nine times. At the other end, the men’s basketball team has won only one conference title, which came via its heroics in the 2009 Pac-10 Tournament
As a result, there exists a belief on campus that USC is not— and never will be — a basketball school, despite world-class facilities in the Galen Center and being located right in the center of one of America’s hotbeds of prep basketball.
To date, one of the greatest mysteries surrounding the USC athletics program has been how the school can have a dominant football team, yet have such a difficult time developing a premier basketball program. But history would likely have been much different had it not been for an unfortunate turn of events that took its toll on the program 25 years ago.
Rewind to 1990, when a promising young player, Ed O’Bannon, out of Artesia High School in the Los Angeles area, was catching the attention of every college coach in America as a blue-chip recruit, while on his way to becoming a McDonald’s High School All-American and national high school player of the year. In the running for O’Bannon’s services were UCLA, Nevada Las Vegas and USC, among many others.
At that time, the Trojans were led by legendary head coach George Raveling, who was recently selected for induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the 2015 class. Raveling made quite the splash when he took over for his predecessor, Stan Morrison, in 1986. The Trojans never had the “Fab Five,” but they did have the “Four Freshmen” in star young players Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble, Tom Lewis and Rich Grande.
After allegedly delivering an ultimatum to the group to decide in a timely manner whether they would be staying at USC or transferring, a threat that most of the players didn’t take seriously, Raveling proceeded to revoke the scholarships of every member of the “Four Freshmen” except Grande, who remained at USC.
Gathers and Kimble transferred to Loyola Marymount, and Lewis took his talents to Pepperdine. Everything, well, unraveled, after the loss of these young standouts.
Raveling endured four rough seasons, during which his teams finished with records well below  .500, that plummeted the Trojans to the bottom of what was then the Pac-10.
Though the first four years were tough for Raveling, he believed that his team was on the brink heading into the 1990-91 season, especially if it could acquire the 6-foot-8 O’Bannon.
Raveling had previously illustrated this idea to O’Bannon when he told the high school star that the Trojans were just one or two players away from becoming a national force.
In order to try to get a leg up on the other schools, Raveling enlisted the services of one of his best friends — sports marketing impresario Sonny Vaccaro, who allegedly had been steering prized recruits to his preferred college programs. Vacarro, however, refused to attempt to maneuver O’Bannon to Raveling and USC. O’Bannon eventually signed with USC’s crosstown rival UCLA, after originally committing to UNLV.
Then and there a curse was born, and it catalyzed a domino effect that would take its toll on the USC basketball program for years.
A few seasons after his brother’s commitment, Charles O’Bannon also elected to play for the Bruins after also considering USC. UCLA, powered by the O’Bannon brothers, went on to win the 1995 NCAA championship.
After losing both of the O’Bannon brothers, Raveling and the Trojans actually finished toward the top half of the then-Pac-10 with winning records for each of the next four seasons. But they were nowhere close to the pinnacle that Raveling had envisioned. As a result, the expected powerhouse of the future never came to fruition.
Prior to the 1994-95 season, the 57-year-old Raveling was severely injured in a car accident that would force his retirement from coaching. With that, an era that was supposed to encompass, perhaps, the program’s finest seasons, was over.
It has seemingly always been what could have been for the USC men’s basketball program. What if  Raveling had gotten one or both of the O’Bannons?
You could argue that Ed O’Bannon’s commitment to USC would have completely shifted the tectonic plate that is recruiting in Southern California, and it could have been the Trojans —not the Bruins — at the forefront of college basketball … both locally and nationally.

And here I thought the Galen Center was built for our Volleyball teams…
Southern California is no hotbed of prep basketball. It is in the Midwest and parts of the South . USC blew it when they didn’t hire Lute Olsen before he went to Arizona. They were also approached by the legendary Sam Gilbert first to lend his assistance to the basketball program, but refused to deal with him. You can’t be serious about the Galen Center being a world class venue. The fab four was really the two from Philadelphia, Gathers and Kimble. Lewis did nothing after he left, and Grande was mediocre at best.
Raveling would not have played the run and gun like Westhead at Loyola rendering Gathers and Kimble not able to reach the heights of their ability. AD Garrett ruined the last chance for the basketball program to prosper throwing the Coach Tim Floyd to the wolves and team under the bus to try and save sanctions on the football team.

Though Halloween will soon  be over, people can keep the ghostly holiday spirit alive long after Oct. 31 by picking up a copy of Stephen King’s newest collection of short stories: The Bazaar of Bad Dreams, out Nov. 3.
I have to admit, I never made it all the way through a Stephen King work until this summer. Prior to that, the only book by the world-renowned author I’d ever dared to read was The Shining, which I was forced to give up on after about 50 pages. I’ve always been very enamored by the horror genre, both in literature and movies. Unfortunately, reading or watching anything even remotely scary usually results in me lying awake at night imagining I’m hearing someone break into my apartment or witnessing some terrifying apparition. As a 15-year-old, when I sensed the utter suspense in King’s writing before anything even slightly frightening happened, I shoved the book onto the highest shelf on my bookcase where I couldn’t even see it.
This summer, I decided to give King another whirl. I’m a great fan of the movie Misery and was keen to read the book. Luckily, this time I made it to the end, and though profoundly disturbed, I was not disappointed. For anyone who has never read King, his writing is rich and steeped in detail. The novel made the film version seem tame in comparison. The book used words that didn’t need loud music or visual stimuli to truly petrify me, which was an astounding feat. King truly has the ability to build tension with the prowess of a clear master. As such, I expect his new collection will be nothing short of excellent. The book of stories are ones he has written throughout his career, some of which have been published, but many are new to readers. One of my favorite aspects is that each one is prefaced by a short passage by King explaining why he wrote the story and where his inspiration for it came from. As a writer myself, I love this detail, which allows readers to understand how the first idea sparked in the author’s brain and how the story came to life.
As for the stories themselves, they promise to be both provocative and chilling. In “Obits,” a newspaper columnist murders people through writing their obituaries. Some are wacky as well as ominous, such as “Mile 81,” about a carnivorous station wagon. Death is a prominent theme throughout the novel, not just as tropes of the horror genre but also as existential thoughts and commentary. For example, “Premium Harmony” takes readers through the perspective of the protagonist, Ray Burkett. King reveals Burkett’s thought processes as his wife dies of a heart attack and then his dog dies shortly afterward.
Similarly, in “Morality,” King explores concepts of conscience and death through a decrepit former reverend who asks his nurse to commit a sin for him. Never having been able to live a life of sin, he wishes to finally give up his innocence. Unable to walk or leave his house, he wants to experience sin through his nurse. The story highlights the nurse and her husband’s feelings of guilt. It also underlines the struggle between the desire for a better life and the morally questionable actions to achieve that ideal.
Some stories are downright creepy, such as “The Dune,” which is told in flashbacks from an old man who recounts canoeing to an island. The man finds a boy whose name is one of many written in the sand. These people later die in a series of freak accidents.
I am excited for the mixture of scary and more introspective stories in this collection. It seems as though it will bear all of King’s famed skill and suspense and will also prompt readers to consider some interesting questions about life, death, guilt and desire. So far, they have received largely positive reviews. I am often drawn to novels rather than short stories. With novels, it’s easier to immerse myself completely in another world and getting to know other characters in a way that only a novel can offer. Still, between juggling many different responsibilities, I can’t be the only one who struggles to find time to read novels for pleasure during school time. As such, short stories provide the perfect opportunity to experience wonderful writing and captivating plots, without having to commit a lot of time. Add to that the spirit and excitement surrounding Halloween, something Americans truly take to a new level, and this collection becomes the perfect way to read something quick, artfully crafted and, of course, completely frightening.

The long-awaited Weekender is finally here. A weekend full of meeting up with friends, exploring Berkeley and attending or watching the big football game against Cal requires some places to eat and drink. Here are a few fan favorites that range from breakfast and brunch to lunch, dinner and late-night places.
The Cheese Board Pizza Collective
This fan favorite is a must-go, best-pizza-all-around spot you won’t want to miss. The collective serves a specific pizza per day, offering vegetable options such as butternut squash, caramelized onion, mozzarella, Comte cheeses, thyme oil and fresh herbs. Everyone in Berkeley knows about this place for a reason. Its cozy shop, located on Shattuck Avenue, first opened as a cheese store in 1967, later opening up a pop-up pizza store in 1985. The Cheese Board is also a participant in Sunday Streets Berkeley, a street festival on Shattuck where the community joins together to listen to music, eat and get to know each other better. If you’re looking for an easy, quick meal, stop by The Cheese Board. You won’t regret it.
Angeline’s Louisiana Kitchen
Based in downtown Berkeley, this restaurant truly gives you the feel of southern hospitality. Specialties include the jambalaya, gumbo, shrimp creole, crawfish etoufee, hush puppies and beignets. The food is based on traditional Cajun and Creole cuisine, consisting of a mixture of rich sauces immersed in exotic herbs alongside rice, pasta and seafood. Go with friends and family to enjoy a great lunch or dinner on the first day you’re in town. Order the swamp water, half lemonade and half unsweetened iced tea, and if you’re not on a date ask them if they are serving the crawfish. You won’t find better fresh boiled Louisiana crawfish anywhere else.
La Note Restaurant Provencal
It’s gameday, now what? Sleep in and go to La Note for a charming French brunch. La Note serves an all-day brunch on Saturdays and Sundays, so be sure to head over there to order some of the regular pancakes topped with sour cream. Even better, share some of the tasty entrees with friends. Order pancakes or French toast and split the Cote Sud, two eggs sunny side up, spicy merguez sausage, homefries and toast with friends. It’s an amazing combination and will leave you satisfied.
Smoke’s Poutinerie
Famous for their catch phrase, “How do you like your poutine?” Smoke’s poutinerie offers the best late-night snack after all the 21-and-over’s have been drinking at the game. Come right after the football game ends to avoid any lines for the perfect fries, gravy and meat combo. It’s open on Fridays and Saturdays until 4 a.m. and Sunday to Tuesday midnight. I can assure you that you won’t regret coming here after a long day.
El Burro Picante
Who doesn’t crave Mexican food on game day? El Burro Picante is known for some of the best Mexican food in NorCal. If you’re too tired from the game and don’t want to stay out longer, use their online ordering system. They are open until midnight except for Sundays, when they close at 11 p.m.
Best bars to watch the game
For all of you who are 21 and up and don’t mind a high-energy rowdy crowd:
Albert’s Sports Lounge
Conveniently located near campus, Albert’s always has a high-energy crowd, great food and service. If football tickets are sold out or prices are too high and you want to catch the game elsewhere, consider coming to Albert’s with some friends.
Pappy’s Grill & Sports Bar
Be prepared to dance, drink and have a great time at Pappy’s Grill. Only a five-minute walk from campus, Pappy’s is the go-to for locals and Cal students. The All-American burger combination is a cheap option if you’re looking to get full easily for a good price. Just be prepared for the Cal decor — it’s everywhere. Pappy’s is an all-around a great place to watch the game on the  HD flat screen TV.

Escape Psycho Circus, organized by Insomniac Events, is now in its second year. The event promises to be one of the biggest Halloween festivals Southern California has ever seen. Sinister sights and rattling sounds seek to both scare and amaze attendees at the NOS Events Center Oct. 30 and 31.
Unlike most music festivals, Escape appears to be more of an overall experience than an average concert. It features labyrinth-like mazes, creepy yet beautiful physical art installations and a host of formidable performers who haunt the grounds. It fosters community among a wide array of people across the country who come together for two nights to let loose.
Certainly, the determining factor in attending Escape is the music. The grounds are going to be home to four stages, each decked out with its own theme and style of music. The Cannibals’ Tea Party, hosted by Richie Hawtin, brings in experimental electronic sounds that will certainly baffle audiences. The Ghouls’ Graveyard features trance and big room EDM with the likes of Blasterjaxx. On the first day, legends such as Paul Van Dyk and established names in the industry including Laidback Luke and Mat Zo will certainly deliver great shows. The Chopping Block promises to excite crowds with the sound of pure bass as trap superstars like Bro Safari, Party Favor and Crizzly perform. Meanwhile, dubstep acts such as Flux Pavilion and Excision are undoubtedly going to get blood pumping. Lastly, bringing in the main stage experience for Escape is the Slaughterhouse. It features some of the biggest and best names in the electronic scene today, including Martin Garrix, Showtek and Above & Beyond. Porter Robinson has also just been added.
Escape certainly has the place, the artists and the experience to potentially turn into one of the biggest festivals around. So for this Halloween, be prepared for the most awe-inspiring weekend of the year.

The stigma regarding those who hold non-violent drug-related offenses is rampant in California. Though under Proposition 47, these offenders have the opportunity for shorter sentences in prison, they are faced with greater issues once they are released from jail: being labeled as unproductive members of society, being unable to build careers and likely committing future thefts or violent acts of crime. Many of these offenders already have careers, yet end up falling into vulnerable situations in which they are sentenced for using or selling illegal substances. So perhaps Proposition 47 opponents, who assert that the bill releases reckless criminals back into society, fail to recognize that the problem lies not in the acquitted individuals but in the prison system itself. Even so, we cannot simply rely on the provisions listed in the bill to overturn the crimes, but, instead, the enforcement who overlook these cases to do so.
Clumping suspects who have committed heinous crimes with persons who have committed misdemeanors as felons is a gross dysfunction of the criminal justice system. Without adequate room to interpret the nature of drug-related offenses, first-time offenders have been instituted in the prison system, overcrowding has been rampant and those who needed help recovering from drug addictions have never received aid. It is silly to allow the overcrowding of our prison systems to persist when many prisoners have merely committed non-violent or low-level crimes.
Last year, however, this notion changed with California’s Proposition 47, a ballot initiative which lifted sentencing for drug possession by making six theft felonies into misdemeanors. But with this year’s reports of increased percentages in property crimes, motor vehicle thefts and violent crime, law enforcement officials are working to reverse the impacts of Proposition 47. In 2014, nearly 60 percent of Californians voted in favor of Proposition 47. At the same time, 27 percent were in opposition of the bill. Just a year later, original opponents of the bill are collaborating to amend the proposition by adding various senate and assembly bills. This year, drug-related offenses fell but there were increases in residential crimes against property.
Since the creation of the initiative, staunch opponents, such as Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, law enforcement officials and several county district attorney offices across California, have explained that the initiative has allowed a get-out-of-jail-free-card for criminals who deserve longer prison sentences. Indeed, the impact of the initiative is tangible. Law enforcement officials viewed the passage of Proposition 47 as a sign that voters were less interested in the incarceration of drug offenders and more interested in other crimes. Rather, voters wanted state funds to be allocated to other areas such as the K-12 educational system. California voters don’t want the state to build more prisons, but to ensure that those who are being imprisoned are being detained rightfully so.
Proposition 47 allows for the acquittal process for persons found using or selling illegal drugs to be determined on a case by case basis. Allowing the court system to do so has significantly decreased the number of prisoners in the state penitentiary system, which directly links to increased funding in other areas.
The fiscal impact statement for the initiative found that funding was to be reallocated to other programs in school truancy and dropout prevention, mental health, substance abuse treatment and victim services.
The issue, however, still remains. The provisions listed within Proposition 47 that allow non-violent drug-related offenders to reduce their prison sentencing — based on condition, since no one is automatically released from state prison due to Prop. 47 — has been wrongly accused of contributing to this year’s increase in property crime. But as San Francisco District Attorney and former Chief of Police George Gascon reminds us in the Los Angeles Times, it is not plausible for these offenses in property crime to be related to the release of prisoners under Proposition 47. This year, less than a quarter of the 43,000 prisoners were released from prison under the initiative. Additionally, it is wrong to assert that the initiative has solved the prison overcrowding issue, which has been perpetuated for decades. The effectiveness of the proposition hinges on the accuracy of risk assessments: pre-trial programs which assess the likelihood of the offender committing future crimes to fulfilling court case appointments and prioritizing jail bed space.
Harsher restrictions that lead to more jail time are not going to solve the problem. Rather, it is the people and their subsequent actions that will solve the problem.

Social media has lit up in the last 48 hours regarding the Campus Climate Resolution, and after taking some time to collect my thoughts, I’ve decided to weigh in as a member of the student body who cares about seeing change on this campus.
On the whole, the resolution is unquestionably a good thing. Discrimination is alive and well at USC. And this bill is a step in the right direction.
Providing increased funding for cultural resources as well as scholarships and fellowships is undoubtedly a good change. Some have expressed concerns about the cost, especially the eye-popping $100 million endowment target. Though I think this is ambitious, I also can think of nowhere better for endowed funds to go than directly toward student resources and undergraduate scholarships. Moreover, ensuring that there is a clear avenue for Title IX reporting is a good thing. Holding the University accountable for its analytics and reporting on diversity is a good thing. And requiring improvements on our recruiting, yield and retention of disadvantaged students are all good things.
I do have concerns regarding the resolution as well. First, with respect to funding, it’s hard for me to ever argue that dollars should ever get in the way of proper resources for students. But when USC continually underpays its employees, underfunds Student Affairs and hemorrhages talented, dedicated staff members at a rate so alarming that I don’t recognize a single face in Student Affairs from when I came here four years ago, I believe a larger conversation needs to be held. That’s not to say that expanding cultural resources or installing a vice dean in each school is by any means a bad thing — however, without a clear funding source and a larger conversation about student affairs funding in general, I am reticent to expect meaningful action by President C. L. Max Nikias or the Board of Trustees when the resolution is presented.
Second, the language of the resolution mandating enrollment of underrepresented populations to be competitive with peer institutions raises questions not because of the goal — which I wholly support — but because of its language. On any issue that runs tangent to affirmative action or admission quotas there are a litany of laws and Supreme Court decisions to consider. Granted, this is a complicated legal issue which and one that may be better left to the University’s General Counsel as this resolution moves up the chain of command. However, as it is such a complicated and semantic matter, I am more than willing to excuse the senators who wanted a little more time to research it.
And at the end of the day, I believe the majority of hesitation to this resolution comes down to semantics. And that’s OK. Semantics matter, and they aren’t a reason this resolution should never be passed. But they’re a reason it’s OK to tap the brakes and take a week or two to pore over the language. After all, this resolution is monumental. This resolution is making change at USC, and this resolution should be scrutinized. That’s a good thing. It means it matters.
On this note, a lot of criticism has been thrown at Undergraduate Student Government senators for opting to push a vote until their next meeting. This frustration is understandable — many are angry about the current state of affairs and excited about change. But so too is a desire on the part of the senators to make sure they agree wholeheartedly with every letter of a document they are permanently stamping their name and seal of approval on. A vote to push the bill is not a cold calculated filibuster, but rather a desire to perfect a resolution that will — hopefully — change USC for the better.
Finally, I would like to turn my attention to the calls for impeachment of both USG President Rini Sampath and the senators. I am frustrated by the complaints that the senators are elected unopposed. That’s true, but when students decry them for voting with their beliefs, they also indict every single undergraduate who decided not to run. Senators put in hundreds of hours a semester to make this University a better place, and a call to impeach them now is an admission that the rest of campus failed to take elections seriously in February.
Similarly, while I certainly didn’t appreciate President Sampath joining in on chants to impeach the senators Tuesday night, any calls for her impeachment are equally childish and unmerited. The student body was loud and clear in electing Sampath, and she has done nothing but advocate for students. It is refreshing, after watching the University administration use smoke, mirrors and town halls to create the illusion of change, to have our USG president take an issue head on and create policy rather than rhetoric.
In the coming weeks, our campus will be alight with conversation about the resolution, and rightfully so. It’s time to make change, but I am hopeful that the conversation will be constructive and civil rather than stubborn and held via Yik Yak. I look forward to the Senate drafting a version of the resolution they can pass and the student body backing them in that effort.

Well, friends, the college football machine rumbles on to Week 9. We’re quickly approaching that time of the year where the dust starts to settle and the playoff picture becomes clearer. It’s close, but we’re not there yet. We may be a little old to be trick-or-treating but at least we’ve still got plenty of time for surprising upsets and spooky matchups!
Georgia at No. 11 Florida (Spread: -5)
Our model has Florida favored in this matchup though this game has lost a bit of luster with Georgia running back Nick Chubb’s knee injury and the season-ending suspension of Florida’s quarterback Will Grier. Regardless, it’ll be a rivalry matchup with SEC conference championship implications. Florida is coming off a bye after a tough loss to LSU two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Georgia is trying to forget last year’s embarrassing 38-20 loss where Florida scored its first touchdown on a fake field goal attempt. Facing a tough Florida defense, it will certainly take a massive effort from quarterback Greyson Lambert to propel the Bulldogs to victory.
No. 9 Notre Dame at No. 21 Temple (Spread: 15)
The consensus matchup of the weekend features a team that’s not usually associated with marquee matchups: the Temple Owls. As one of only 12 remaining unbeaten FBS teams, Temple faces Notre Dame in arguably their biggest and toughest game of the season.
That being said, Vegas and our model predict that Notre Dame will blow out Temple. It’s true — Temple has a tough defense and a great running back in Jahad Thomas, but it’s hard to overlook their soft schedule. However, Notre Dame is coming off of a bye week and their game is on Halloween so you never know what might happen. And besides, who doesn’t love a good underdog story?
Interesting note: This will be the first ranked matchup in Temple’s history and the 212th ranked matchup for Notre Dame.
No. 12 Oklahoma State at Texas Tech (Spread: -9)
UPSET ALERT!
Our model has Texas Tech as a nine-point favorite while Vegas odds have Oklahoma State as a one-point favorite, but it’ll depend on how much fight is left in Texas Tech after a tough loss to Oklahoma last week.
Texas Tech has proven they can score on anyone (see TCU game), but it’s their defense that may lose them the game. Texas Tech’s defense has given up 561.5 yards per game this season, which means that there is no question Oklahoma State will be able to at least get some points on the board. Aside from somehow managing to keep up with Texas Tech’s scoring, the other key for Oklahoma State’s defense is to force turnovers and give their offense the opportunity to attack the Red Raider’s porous defense. This could be possible considering Oklahoma’s defense has only allowed 18.9 points per game this season.
Maybe Texas Tech will score a ridiculous number of points, maybe Oklahoma State will take advantage of Tech’s porous defense and be on its undefeated way. Who knows. Tune in to find out.
USC at California (Spread: -5.5)
It’s that special weekend of the college football season for USC football fans, the Weekender. This year, though, fans should be in for a more exciting game than in previous years. Though Cal has lost two straight since a 5-0 start, don’t expect them to roll over and play dead. On the other hand, USC pulled off its biggest win of the year against Utah, looking every bit like the explosive, talented team everyone thought we were in the preseason.
So I know what you’re thinking, after such a great performance last weekend, why does our model have Cal as the 5.5 point favorite? One possible explanation is that the Trojans and the Bears have similar offensive stats with 38.9 points per game and 492.0 total offensive yards and 37.9 points per game and 504.6 total offensive yards, respectively. The same goes for yards allowed with the Trojans allowing 395.4 yards and Cal allowing 420.3 yards. The first factor likely skewing our model in favor of Cal is their slightly lower turnover margin of 0.67 versus the Trojans of 1. Second, the large home field advantage biased in our model could also help explain why our prediction is the opposite of Vegas and ESPN.
However, if the Trojan defense can continue to make plays like they did against Utah and the offensive line can give Kessler enough breathing room, we think the Trojans can come away from the Weekender victorious and remain in the hunt for the Pac-12 Championship.

Two words: The. Weekender. Who’s ready? I know I’m ready to see our football team sock it to Cal this weekend, and I’m sure after that marvelous blowout win against Utah, everyone else is too. Whether it’s your first time going or your last, make sure you make some great memories and see why everyone praises the Weekender so much.
Something that’s often overlooked is the road trip portion of the Weekender. Anyone who has had a bad drive knows it can make or break the entire trip. There are a few simple ways to ensure that your road trip never takes a bad turn (see what I did there?). The easiest way is to not ride with a bunch of buzz-kills who “didn’t get a lot of sleep the night before,” so they’re just going to “nap most of the way there” so they “have energy for the game.” Just as important, however, is having a great playlist to listen to on the way to and from the game.
For this particular road trip, it’s important to get pumped going to the game. You should still be excited on the way back, but not too excited. Keeping the energy up is key, but if you still have enough energy to go balls-to-the-wall on the way back, you did the Weekender wrong.
I threw in some songs that will hopefully make your heart race just a little bit faster to build anticipation for the game. There are also some songs that are good to throw on during a road trip in general, and some classic sing-alongs and throwbacks that even the buzz-kills will participate in.
Remember, The Weekender only comes once a year, so you should make every moment as special as possible, especially jamming out to songs with your friends during what will hopefully be one of the greatest car rides of your life.

This week, in the heart of Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, I explored a local favorite, Café Dulce. I tasted a variety of the donuts they have to offer, all of which found a special place in my heart.
Because it is located in the Japanese Village Plaza, the little shop is surrounded by authentic Japanese restaurants and cafés. It’s adorned with red and white lanterns, creating a relaxing atmosphere for guests to enjoy good treats with good company. I do have to have one caveat, however: Cafe Dulce is not exclusively a donut shop, which is both good and bad. Though I wish there had been more donut options, it was also nice that they offered drinks and other foods to create a full meal. Though the shop did not have a large variety, I was extremely impressed with the donuts I tried from their limited selection.
The first donut I selected was a Fruity Pebbles donut hole, one of the two flavors Café Dulce offers, the other one being bacon. 
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
These donut holes are unlike the typical ones sold at generic donut shops. Instead of having a glazed frosting, they are topped with a thin layer of whipped cream and then their respective toppings. I’ll admit that eating multiple full-sized donuts in one day can be too much sugar — even though I do this all the time — but these mini donuts are nice for times when you want to treat yourself to something sweet but don’t want to feel guilty afterwards.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
The next donut that caught my attention was the Strawberry Cream donut, mostly because the strawberry on top was glimmering with a layer of edible glitter. Of course, I was overly excited to consume glitter in a way that would be socially acceptable, so I definitely enjoyed eating the rest of this donut, too. Though it didn’t eclipse every other donut I’ve ever had, I would still deem it a “good donut.”
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
And finally, I chose to try the Green Tea donut for my third and final treat to complement the Japanese ambiance in the plaza. This one was by far my favorite because of the contrast in the dry bread and the pleasant surprise of cream filling on the inside. I especially loved that you could taste the green tea flavor, but it wasn’t a try-hard like most of the recent matcha green tea recipes that have become popular recently.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan

Overall, I had a very pleasant experience tasting all of these unique donuts and relaxing in the Japanese Village Plaza. Now all I can say is, “Arigatō, Café Dulce!”
Café Dulce is located at 134 Japanese Village Plaza Mall, Los Angeles, CA 90012, and is open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. all week.
