Late last year, the Education Department announced its plan to implement policy changes in Title IX guidelines that are meant to shape how universities receiving public funding handle campus sexual assault. Among the most alarming changes are proposals to limit universities’ authority to investigate assaults off campus or school property, allow accused students to cross-examine survivors and establish a narrower, more stringent definition of sexual harassment. 
These proposed guideline changes are a dramatic contrast from those under the Obama-era Education Department. Back then, the department made significant efforts to support survivors by lowering evidentiary standards and putting greater pressure on universities to take sexual violence seriously. With changes taking effect soon, the Education Department is taking comments from constituents until Jan. 28. 
At this critical moment, it is crucial that USC speaks clearly to the student body about how these federal guideline changes would impact the University’s Title IX office and its treatment of students. 
Specifically, USC must develop a proactive campus education campaign to ensure that students know and understand USC’s policies on sexual misconduct and the current reporting process in the Trump era. The University must be transparent about its policies, plans and intentions. This includes hearing student voices through town halls and listening sessions and increasing engagement with student cultural assemblies that represent students who are disparately affected by sexual violence. 
Advocates of justice for sexual assault survivors have long spoken out against and demonstrated how proposals by the Trump Education Department’s proposals are damaging to survivors’ rights and safety, and the aforementioned proposed changes are no different. These policy changes will almost certainly discourage already jarringly low reporting rates. More than 90 percent of campus sexual assaults are unreported, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. And despite the Education Department’s misguided narrative of standing up for men victimized by purported “false accusers,” men are more likely to experience sexual violence themselves than be falsely accused of it. 
In other words, the University has a moral obligation to use its national influence to reject and speak out against these proposed changes. As an institution of higher learning, there is simply no excuse for USC to remain silent on a pressing issue that so vastly impacts the safety, dignity and health of its students. 
Research has shown that 34 percent of all survivors of campus rape in the United States are not able to graduate due to universities’ failure to provide adequate resources for survivors. In addition to rejecting the proposed changes, USC should also call upon its students to make their voices heard and directly submit comments to the Education Department about the proposals during the comment period.
But in addition to speaking out against these immoral policy proposals at the national level, the University must also speak directly to its students about the resources available to survivors. An AlcoholEdu course — or any online program to be thoughtlessly clicked through — simply will not suffice. 
USC must  engage more with residence halls, cultural assemblies, campus organizations, student government and departments to ensure that students know how to reach USC Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services, Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards and other campus groups that offer wide-ranging support and resources to survivors. 
Moreover, this outreach must involve more proactive listening to students and survivors about their needs and where the University should invest more funding and resources to meet these needs. For example, many students have demanded improved access to rape kits for years, as well as more expansive education about campus sexual violence prevention. 
Frankly, if any university ought to speak loud and clear and reject the Trump administration’s latest round of threats to survivors’ safety, it’s this one. In recent years, USC has been embroiled in multiple sexual misconduct scandals, including one involving a former campus gynecologist accused of assaulting hundreds of former patients for nearly three decades. The University’s rate of reported sexual assaults has also narrowly exceeded the national average in recent years, according to USC’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report.
As a result of these scandals, the University has lost trust and credibility among its most important stakeholders — its students. Now, USC must take the first step toward establishing trust by proactively working to advocate for survivors’ rights.

As California’s new governor Gavin Newsom takes control of the state’s most powerful seat, new laws spearheaded during outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration are starting to take flight. For the most part, these laws will have a positive effect on California and for Brown’s  gubernatorial legacy. 
Some of the important areas that received legislation include gun control, the state criminal justice system and inclusivity and diversity regarding gender.
Though there was not much federal change, California moved to increase gun control. Following many tragic mass shootings last year, like the Thousand Oaks shooting which occurred less than an hour away from USC campus, Brown’s most recent gun control legislation raises the minimum purchase age for rifles and shotguns to 21. Critics of this law argued that raising the age for semi-automatic rifles would do “depressingly little,” since the age limit remains 18 for those purchasing from unlicensed sellers.
Though it is much more difficult to police private, unlicensed gun sales, it is an oversight to insist that this legislation makes no difference. The Stoneman Douglas and Sandy Hook shootings are two of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history, and both cases involved a gunman under 21 who legally purchased a gun. According to a study on pre-attack behaviors of active shooters conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 2000 to 2013, most active shooters obtain their firearms legally. 
In addition to gun control, the criminal justice system saw changes for minors who are being tried in court. While citizens are guaranteed a right to trial by jury, minors should be provided additional protections due to age and the possibility of committing crimes in their adult lives. California’s new focus on rehabilitation of minors ensures justice for those who may be too young to understand the justice system. 
Previously, California did not have a minimum age to stand trial — children as young as 8 years old were tried in juvenile court and sent to probation camp. Now, there is an age minimum of 12 to stand trial for certain crimes. Rather than being sent to probation camp after delinquency court, minors will have the opportunity to go to mental health or dependency court, or partake in alternative services. Adult courts also have an age limit now. Those standing trial must be 16 or older to be tried as an adult. These new age limits set better standards for considering minors and may increase criminal justice efficiency.
Another new law requires publicly traded corporations to have women on their boards — at least one by the end of this year, with increasing proportion in following years. While this law has been met with fierce objection, there is no doubt that many qualified women are ready to join the boys’ club. It is not a question of skill, but of corporate willingness to promote equality and inclusion.
However, this new legislation seems to be more of a grand gesture than an assessment of the root of the issue. Groups like the California Chamber of Commerce are concerned about the displacement of current male board members. The Chamber believes that it is unfair to displace existing boards “solely on the basis of gender.” 
Despite collective qualms, this new legislation will push companies to rethink their interview and hiring processes for future decisions. It is much more difficult to regulate the companies’ internal functions than to require hiring that is just as much a public display of solidarity. To avoid the issue of displacement, corporations should consider expanding their boards.
Another new law that particularly affects our local community is higher protections for sidewalk vendors — this includes beloved downtown taco trucks, cotton candy carts and sidewalk sunglasses stands. This change may be overlooked in suburban spaces, but in highly urban communities like Los Angeles, this law is a positive change for many whose livelihoods rely on street vending.
Local legislation varies, but at least in Los Angeles, this statewide protection prohibits local governments from dictating where and how many vendors could sell their food and goods. There are some requirements, like minimum distance between vendors and necessary access points, such as fire hydrants. There are also a few locations that are off limits for overcrowding safety issues, like the Hollywood Walk of Fame and game days at Dodger Stadium. But now that street vending is legal, many people in the L.A. community are protected from unnecessary fines and other consequences.
While on the surface many of these laws seem to be grandiose, they do their best to address issues Californians have battled time and again. Despite the gridlock on federal reforms, California is moving in a direction that improves the criminal justice system, gender equality and local communities.

The new SCA scholarship was named in honor of Jon Chu, a graduate of the school. (Tucker Judkins / Daily Trojan)
USC boosters Karen Wong and Scott Lee recently endowed the Jon Chu Asian Pacific Alumni Association Cinematic Arts Scholarship, which provides financial aid for students working on media projects that portray aspects of the Asian Pacific culture. Wong and Lee named the scholarship in honor of Chu, an alumnus and the director of the 2018 film “Crazy Rich Asians.” 
According to Justin Wilson, the senior director of alumni relations at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, the scholarship with a $100,000 endowment will be awarded this semester and will continue to be awarded on an annual basis. SCA students whose projects focus on the representation of Asian Pacific culture are eligible for scholarship consideration.
Wong, a member of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee for the USC Alumni Association’s Board of Governors, first approached SCA dean Elizabeth Daley in February 2007 to establish an AAPA scholarship, which was recently renamed in honor of Chu.
“I don’t think pursuing a career in the entertainment industry is one of the career paths that Asian parents typically envision for their kids, so I was really impressed by his path,” Wong said.
Wong said the long term goal is for more people to donate to the endowment over time and to keep the scholarship growing in an effort to support students who are not recognized for their passions. The scholarship also seeks to encourage diversity and inclusion in the film industry.
“I hope that over time others will donate to the endowment to further the gift,” Lee said. 
Lee said that in years past, the film industry has not produced many films focusing on Asian American experiences and that these kinds of films were “not recognized or really supported.” 
Wong said that USC has been working hard to integrate diversity and inclusion on campus,  such as by incorporating more representation on the board.
“Our vision is for it to grow into a large endowment where multiple students engaged in a career path that will further this genre will be awarded,” Wong said.
Many students are inspired by Chu’s success story as he graduated from SCA in 2003. Freshman Ethan Soo, who is majoring in film production, said that the spotlight being shined on the lack of Asian American voices in the entertainment industry provides hope for many young USC film makers. 
“People like Jon Chu and Eugene Yang are my role models,” Soo said. “They’ve definitely been the pioneers of this new culture shift. It’s been great to see people who look similar to me and the fact that USC is helping to give Asian students a voice is fantastic.”

World Travel: Austin Maddox, a journalism fellow of the Center on Public Diplomacy, captures content on her phone for a video CPD plans to release this semester. (Amara Aguilar)
It’s a hot December day in New Delhi, India, and Amara Aguilar is in a room with a travel blogger, a few international ambassadors, various diplomats and a videogame designer, giving a lecture on making GIFs. 
Aguilar attended India’s first major conference in December on soft power, the use of cultural and economic influence to appeal to other countries, rather than the use of military power, which invited USC’s Center on Public Diplomacy as a primary academic partner. The two-day conference included panels, workshops and performances and brought together diplomats, scholars and experts from around the world.
Aguilar, an associate professor in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, kicked off the conference with her workshop: “Soft Power Through Digital Storytelling.” Aguilar, a CPD faculty fellow who conducts digital training for the Center, said her workshop aimed to empower individuals to share their country’s stories through social media.
“It was a really great trip overall,” said Aguilar. “[CPD] is always amazing to work with.” 
Participants in Aguilar’s workshop learned to make videos and GIFs that covered a wide range of topics like travel, tourism, literature and art and discussed the best ways to engage audiences visually.
“All of these topics are really important for people to be able to tell their stories, so other people can understand the country and the people of the country,” Aguilar said. “In your pocket you have your mobile device, which is a powerful tool to create really compelling content at little or no cost.”
Aguilar said CPD excels at recognizing the importance of social media and data as tools of public diplomacy, something not everyone has caught onto yet. 
Austin Maddox, a CPD student fellow, attended the conference as a video journalist and reported live from USC’s Instagram story. The first-year graduate student in the School of Journalism spent her time at the conference collecting B-roll and interviewing attendees for videos that CPD plans to release later this semester.
Of the people that Maddox interviewed, she said Gopi Kallayil, Google’s chief evangelist of brand marketing, stood out as a favorite. Part of Kallayil’s work aims to combine spirituality and technology through the practice of yoga.                         
“He’s brought yoga to 80 percent of all Google offices,” Maddox said. “I thought he was really cool and insightful … [his work] is something that I, personally, and I know a lot of my friends deal with in our lives; trying to maintain a center while still engaging in technology.”
Jay Wang, the director of CPD, spoke on a panel called “Public Diplomacy, Successes and Challenges in National Building.” Wang spoke about the importance of technology as a tool for public diplomacy, but also some of the challenges.
“We don’t have the playbook as we enter into this new era of how we engage with international publics,” Wang said. “Because the scale of change is so big, it presents a huge challenge for us to have a firm grasp of what’s happening in the technological field, and what are the implications for our practices.” 
Wang said one of CPD’s focuses is professional training and education, which Aguilar assists with often. While CPD has traveled to numerous countries, it will be holding its first international training session in Brussels next month, called “Technology, Storytelling & Public Diplomacy.” The workshop will focus on the integration of data and technology as tools of public diplomacy. 
Wang said the conference in New Delhi was significant because CPD had yet to travel to India. As a “leading academic center” in the field of public diplomacy, Wang said it was important for CPD to partner with India’s first conference on soft power. 
“On campus, many, I don’t think, really know the center exists, but the center’s work in this field is very well recognized in Washington D.C. and increasingly in many other countries,” Wang said.
Maddox said one of her goals for this semester as a student fellow is to engage USC students with CPD’s work. 
“[CPD] values the student perspective,” Maddox said. “[Public diplomacy] is something that young people around the world would be interested in. It just needs to be presented in a way that they can understand.”

Kursat Pekgoz published an instruction guide on his personal website that explains his views on affirmative action policy. (Mia Speier/Daily Trojan)
In an unprecedented move, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is using Title IX policy to investigate claims of discrimination against men. Over the past 15 months, USC doctoral student Kursat Pekgoz filed federal Title IX complaints against USC and two other universities for allegedly discriminating against male students. 
The department has opened up investigations into USC and two other universities. 
Pekgoz, who is pursuing his doctorate in English literature and is an assistant lecturer in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, alleges that certain efforts to support female students at USC, Yale and Princeton University, such as women-only and women-targeted scholarships and clubs, have resulted in discrimination against male students, according to a recent interview with NBC. 
Pekgoz declined to comment to the Daily Trojan. 
In February 2018, Pekgoz filed a complaint against Yale in which he alleged that the university violated Title IX on three accounts, according to a sample complaint made publicly available on Pekgoz’s personal website. 
Pekgoz claims that Yale violates Title IX policy by funding and sustaining programs that practice discrimination in their admission processes, scholarships that exclude on the basis of sex and campus spaces that are women-only. 
According to the Office for Civil Rights website, the Department of Education launched investigations in Yale in April 2018 and USC in January 2018. 
“Both complaints seek to abolish affirmative action for women in colleges, the University of Southern California and Yale University, in particular,” Pekgoz wrote in his guide. 
Pekgoz also published a “How To Abolish Affirmative Action For Women” guide online in an effort to demonstrate the ease of filing Title IX complaints. 
In his guide, Pekgoz wrote that any campus space, scholarship, award, training, event, conference or initiative that is available for only women may violate Title IX policies. 
Pekgoz also states that women’s studies programs might violate Title IX policy. 
“This [program] can be tricky,” Pekgoz wrote. “Does the program have no male faculty members? Does the program have no male students? Does the program have any scholarships which no male has ever received? If any question can be answered with a ‘yes,’ you should file a Title IX complaint.”
Pekgoz wrote in his guide that, although affirmative action policy on the basis of race is protected by past Supreme Court rulings, similar policy on the basis of sex is not justified. 
According to CBS Local, the DoEd has also opened up an investigation into Tulane University after receiving similar complaints regarding male discrimination. 
The DoEd has yet to disclose any new information regarding the open investigations.
“USC is committed to maintaining an environment that is free from discrimination and that encourages fair treatment of all students, faculty and staff, a value that is emphasized in university policies,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan.

A California judge condemned USC’s handling of sexual assault cases in a 3-0 ruling on Friday, referencing the expulsion of a former USC football player who was accused of raping a fellow student in October 2014. 
This ruling was made in light of controversial new rules that have been proposed by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, many of which enhance the rights of the accused. 
The decision overturns USC’s findings that the former athlete, referred to as John Doe in the case, had violated the University’s student code of conduct. 
The University’s disciplinary review process for the sexual assault case “failed to provide a fair hearing” for Doe, according to the case file. 
After Doe was accused of sexual assault by a student referred to as Jane Roe in the case, USC’s Title IX office conducted an investigation which resulted in Doe’s expulsion.
The ruling states that Doe will have the opportunity to question witnesses in front of a neutral fact-finder. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC wrote that its review process was “in compliance with its student conduct policies and with state and federal laws in place at the time of the investigation.” 
“When this case was investigated and at the time the Superior Court heard the petition, no case in California required a private university to conduct a live hearing or to permit the responding student to confront and cross examine either the complainant or witnesses,” USC wrote.
USC addressed the changing standards in the ways universities handle sexual assault cases and wrote that “USC will keep abreast of these evolving judicial interpretations and requirements.”
This is not the first time a court has ruled USC’s Title IX investigations as unfair. Last year, a judge ordered the University to pay $111,965 in legal fees to a student who was accused of sexual assault in 2016 after deeming USC’s disciplinary process to be biased. 
Both the 2014 and 2016 accused students are represented by lawyer Mark Hathaway. Hathaway did not respond to request for comment at the time of publication.

This semester, the entirely-student run Liquid Propulsion Lab team hopes to trial , a larger 3-D-printed engine. (Jan Fessl / Daily Trojan)
After months of designing, planning and spending, the USC Liquid Propulsion Lab fired the world’s first student-made 3-D-printed rocket engine a month ahead of schedule. 
The engine, named James, was made entirely on campus, a feat not accomplished before by any student group around the world, according to USC News. 
The parts constituting James were constructed at the USC Viterbi Center for Advanced Manufacturing and taken to USC’s machine shop for finishing. 
“The reason we chose this particular material is because it qualified with the temperature and pressure qualities that we needed,” said Nihar Patel, a second-year graduate student studying aerospace engineering and engineering management, as well as the designer on the larger Balerion engine.  
However, printing occurs after a long process of computer-automated design of each individual part. Computer-automated design allows engineers to create designs using vector-based graphics. The design for the smaller engine took nearly a semester. 
“[Printing] opens up a door to a vast majority of design that is not available with traditional [manufacturing] and it really opens up a designer’s creativity,” Patel said. 
While the printing process was tedious, Patel said it outshined traditional manufacturing in both time and cost efficiency. According to Patel, additive manufacturing allowed the student researchers to make small changes on their computer and begin a reprint immediately, while traditional processes could take months. 
“The additive manufacturing process allows to create a lot of components that are more complex,”  said Emily Dzurilla, a second-year graduate student studying astronautical engineering who assisted on the final design of the engine. “It also allows us to get them faster than traditional machining.” 
During the test, which took place in the Mojave Desert in November, the engine produced 600 pounds of thrust along with 725 pounds of pressure in its holding chamber. The engine is a liquid propulsion engine — the only kind that LPL crafts, which incorporates a more complex engine that allows for variable thrust and easily repeatable tests. 
In addition to James, LPL has also engineered 3-D printed engine Balerion, which can produce 2,250 pounds of thrust. Testing for the engine will occur in the spring. 
“[Balerion] is about two to three times bigger [than James] and can produce a max of 10 kilonewtons,” said German Padilla, the engine design engineer and a second-year graduate student studying astronautical engineering. 
Though LPL is relatively new on campus, it has experienced an increasing amount of notoriety due to its recent feats. Its work was presented at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Propulsion Conference over the summer. In October, the designs of the 3-D-printed engine were presented at the International Aeronautical Congress in Bremen, Germany. 
“The other day, we had SpaceX engineers come and tour the lab … we’re getting the attention from the big companies,” Padilla said. “It opens up a lot of connections and possibilities of future employment.” 
As the lab enters its fourth year, the LPL team plans to trial fire Balerion sometime in the spring, while simultaneously working on making testing of James more efficient. 
“We’re very focused on doing good work and setting really ambitious goals. We want to be able to produce the best engineers out of our lab,” Dzurilla said.

Freshman and spring admit Sarah Elmashat sits in her dorm room, a renovated lounge in Pardee Tower. (Tucker Judkins / Daily Trojan)
When spring admit and freshman human biology major Sarah Elmashat first learned she would be living in a renovated lounge in Pardee Tower, she was concerned because she didn’t know what the room looked like or what accommodations would be included.
“I was just worried because I didn’t have any information on what the set-up was going to be like, but moving in and seeing everything there and making it homey just made it feel a lot better,” Elmashat said. “There’s a lot of positives to it too. We have a bigger room than an average freshman in Pardee.” 
About 50 spring admits moved into renovated study lounges last week due to a lack of available on-campus housing, according to USC Housing. In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC Housing Senior Associate Director Christopher Ponsiglione said the housing office has received mainly positive comments from spring admits assigned to lounges so far. 
“Feedback from most students is that they are pleased with their Housing assignment, especially those that were assigned to traditionally high demand buildings like New/North and South Residential Colleges,” Ponsiglione said in the statement.
Freshman Nicole Liebeler, a spring admit majoring in law, history and culture, is situated in a Fluor Tower lounge. Liebeler said she also had concerns about what bathroom she would use and how much storage space would be available. 
Since moving in, Liebeler said she hasn’t experienced any problems with the accommodations. While the lounge doesn’t have closets or bureaus like traditional dorms, she said there are clothing racks and drawers for storage. 
“I’ve stayed in dorms in summer programs, and it just feels like one of those, which is totally fine for freshmen housing,”  Liebeler said. “I’ll only be in there for a semester. It’s convenient, and it’s in a good place so that’s what I’m really concerned about.” 
Ponsiglione also said that as other housing options become available, the spring admits will be moved into permanent housing. 
For the time being, however, some freshman residents are upset over the loss of their shared spaces. 
When freshman international relations and art history major Sophia Ceniza’s New North Residential College study lounge was converted into student housing, everyone on the floor lost their lounge.
“The lounge has become for everybody on my floor … this place for cultivating community where we all study, where we eat, where we talk, where we can spend social time together,”  Ceniza said. “It’s become a useful space for every single person on the floor, and so finding out our lounge is going to be taken away was kind of devastating for everyone.”
Freshman business administration major Sophie Antebi, who also lives on the third floor in New North, said she was sad to learn that the lounge would be converted into student housing.
“Obviously it’s upsetting to us that we lost our lounge because it was a nice community space for people to go do their homework or hang out,” Antebi said. “The only reason they took away our lounge is because there wasn’t enough student housing in other places to put people, so I think USC either needs more housing or shouldn’t admit too many students.” 
On Dec. 6, Ceniza wrote an email to USC Housing and New North Residential College explaining the significance of the lounge to the residents and asking for accommodations to replace the converted space. 
Ceniza and 19 other residents signed the email, which also said that other lounge spaces they had access to were “inadequate for studying and homework” because they didn’t have tables, desks or other seating arrangements. 
To fix this problem, Ponsiglione said USC Housing furnished the lounges to create communal study areas.
“Housing placed more study specific furniture in the many remaining lounges to work towards meeting the needs of the current residents,” Ponsiglione said. 
Ceniza also said that she and the girls on her floor think their communal bathroom will be overcrowded since more residents have to share the two working toilets and four showers. 
“I think a concern for a lot of girls and people in general [is that] you spend so much money to be able to utilize USC Housing,” Ceniza said. “At minimum it should provide things like a bathroom that’s not overcrowded and a lounge space where you can work.”

This year’s OWN IT Summit expects to have double the attendance of last year’s event, and will feature over 150 speakers, including “Orange is the New Black” actress Laverne Cox. (Luke Harold / Wikimedia Commons)
Fresh off the heels of 2018, dubbed by many as another “year of the woman,” students in USC OWN IT don’t plan on slowing that momentum down. The USC OWN IT Summit, which aims to “inspire the next generation of women,” will come to Bovard Auditorium with an expected 1,000 guests for its third year on Jan. 12. 
The event is entirely student-run and will feature keynote speaker Laverne Cox and 150 others. According to the OWN IT website, the organization helps connect the students of USC to inspiring female leaders with their annual event.
“Almost all of our speakers come free of charge, so they have to really want to be a part of this event,” said executive director Erica Wenger, a senior majoring in business administration. 
The eight-hour event will give attendees the opportunity to meet and network with recruiters and hear from renowned public figures from different fields.
“We’re being a lot more conscious of who we’re inviting to speak,”  Wenger said. “The mainstage speakers are going to be the ones that we all know their names, they’ve made massive progress in their specific industry or for one department in general.” 
All of those who attend will be able to hear from mainstage speakers and an array of breakout panelists, including Lara Parker, the senior editor of Buzzfeed and Sheri Bonner, the CEO and president of Planned Parenthood Pasadena and San Gabriel Valley.
“Yes, [the speakers] were older than we were, but they made it relatable for people our age and girls in college,”  said Stephanie Chang, a USC alumna who attended the event two years ago. “They made it really easy for USC college students to show up and get access to so many incredible women.” 
The event will cover a variety of topics ranging from career development to maintaining one’s mental health. 
“It’s a lot of what’s happening in the world right now,”  Wenger said. “You want to be talking about just your career development, but also family relationships, right? What about romantic relationships and career?” 
Guests will be able to attend discussions on these topics from sisters Erin Foster and Sara Foster, the heads of creatives for the dating app Bumble, as well as Jessica Jackley, the founder of the non-profit loan service Kiva, and her husband Reza Aslan, a prolific religious scholar and author. 
Students who plan on attending the event also expressed the value of networking and meeting other students.
“OWN IT is an opportunity to meet women who are evening the playing field, not only the entrepreneurial field but also simply as leaders of the changing world,”  said Angel Duan, a freshman majoring in business administration who plans on attending the event. “It’s not just the speakers that are doing that, it’s also the people who are going. These are the people who are going to be following into the speakers’ footsteps.”

USC football continued a trend of strong recruiting at the wide receiver position Saturday, earning verbal commits from five-star playmakers Bru McCoy and Kyle Ford. The two California products make it three straight years that the Trojans have reeled in a five-star receiver.
McCoy, a product of Mater Dei High School, won MaxPrep’s National Player of the Year Award and will join freshman Amon-Ra St. Brown, his high school teammate, in the Trojan receiving corps. He is 247 Sports’ seventh-ranked overall prospect, while Ford checks in at No. 29 in the composite rankings.
McCoy signed his letter of intent by the Early Signing Day deadline on Dec. 19. Ford, along with four-star wide receiver Puka Nacua and running back Jordan Wilmore, are hard commits to USC’s 2019 class. Including the hard commits and players who signed their letter of intent on Early Signing Day, USC has 22 incoming freshmen.
Four-star offensive tackle Jason Rodriguez is USC’s highest-rated signee of the early period and boasts a monstrous 6-foot-6, 326-pound frame. The Trojans also added three-star offensive guard Tilini Livai from Narbonne High School in Harbor City.
“We were really excited to get this young man and what he brings to the table with size,” head coach Clay Helton said of Rodriguez. “He’s one that could step in and help us with depth immediately.”
The leading signee early in the day was four-star cornerback Max Williams from Junipero Serra High School in Gardena. The second signee after three-star quarterback Kedon Slovis, Williams was not the only defensive back who signed with the Trojans. Three-star safety Briton Allen from IMG Academy in Florida will provide greater depth for a safety position that was depleted due to injuries in 2018, while three-star cornerback Trey Davis will come down from Washington to battle for playing time.
“One of the more special athletes, we thought, out of the city,” Helton said of Williams. “[He has] the ability to play corner or nickel and is very quick-twitch.”
The Trojans gained a pair of four-star tight ends with Jude Wolfe from St. John Bosco High School and Ethan Rae from Orange Lutheran High School. Both standing at least 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds, the duo present the team with a greater number of red zone options moving forward. Helton said that he thought both players are among the best in the country at their position. The team plans on using them as in-line tight ends because of their athleticism and ball skills, Helton said.
USC also added to its strongest position: wide receiver. Four-star Drake London from Moorpark should become a familiar face on campus as a two-sport recruit for both the football and basketball teams. Munir McClain, a three-star receiver from JSerra Catholic High School in San Juan Capistrano, will join his brother Abdul-Malik, who served as a freshman linebacker for the Trojans this season. Three-star running back Kenan Christon out of Madison High School in San Diego adds to a talented group of running backs.
Furthermore, the Trojans added three linebackers to an already solid group. The highlight of the trio is four-star Maninoa Tufono, who joins fellow Hawaiian freshman Palaie Gaoteote at inside linebacker. In addition, the Trojans secured three-star recruits Ralen Goforth from St. John Bosco and Stanley Ta’ufo’ou from Grace Brethren High School in Simi Valley.
Four-star Centennial defensive end Drake Jackson’s announcement that he would be committing to USC rather than Pac-12 South rival Arizona State marked a huge win for a Trojan defensive line that sought to replace departing senior linebacker Porter Gustin. Three-stars Nick Figueroa out of Riverside C.C. High School and Gino Quinones from St. Louis High School in Honolulu add depth at defensive end.
“[He has] one of the unique body types that is out there, kind of a hybrid outside linebacker and defensive end,” Helton said of Jackson. “He can stand up or put his hand on the ground, he’s a really unique pass rusher.”
Three-star defensive tackle Dejon Benton from Pittsburg High School rounds out the Trojans’ early class. USC’s 2019 class ranks 13th in the country following McCoy and Ford’s commitments, according to 247 Sports.

Sophomore middle blocker Sam Lewis led the Trojans with 87 blocks, 13 digs and 12 aces as a freshman last season. (Ling Luo / Daily Trojan)
Coming off an 8-20 season that saw two seven-game losing streaks, USC men’s volleyball hopes to make a statement early in the 2019 season. 
USC is carrying itself with the motto “Resurgence,” hoping to bounce back from the most overall losses and conference losses in a season for the team since 2005. However, season highlights included sweeping No. 3 UCLA in the last home game of the season and defeating No. 5 Pepperdine in a 3-1 match in the first round of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament. 
“Resurgence” was palpable in the team’s first game of the season in which it defeated Canada’s No. 3 team Alberta in a 3-1 match. Senior outside hitter Jack Wyett led the offense with 16 kills and a .560 hitting percentage, and senior outside hitter Ryan Moss contributed 12 kills. Sophomore setter Chris Hall filled the void left by graduating setter Gert Lisha, leading the offense with 34 assists.
“Last season did not meet the standard of excellence that we are used to at USC, not even close,” said head coach Jeff Nygaard. “All of us were disappointed and upset with how we performed. We have embraced the challenge of bouncing back in 2019. I believe we will.”
Nygaard is in his fourth year as head coach and holds a 29-53 overall record. He spent five seasons prior as the middle blockers and lead assistant coach.
The Trojans will return 14 players and add some new faces to the roster this season. Wyett will lead USC in both sides of the game. He finished last season with a .290 hitting percentage and led the team in overall digs with 151, earning All-MPSF first team honors and 2018 AVCA All-American honorable mention. In seven games, he boasted over 20 kills. 
“Jack carried a big load for us last year and delivered, and I expect it will be more of the same this year,” Nygaard said. “After gaining valuable training experience with the USA team this summer, he comes back more seasoned and physical and with higher expectations, from both himself and us.”
Sophomore middle blocker Sam Lewis will take on a leadership role on the Trojan squad after captaining the 2018 USA Volleyball Junior National Team. He finished the 2018 season as an MPSF All-Freshman selection with a .334 hitting percentage and team-high 87 blocks. Although he is currently recovering from a collapsed lung, Lewis’ National Team experience should carry the Trojans throughout the season once he recovers. 
Senior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso trailed Wyett last season with 275 kills and lead the team with 45 aces, ranking No. 10 nationally in aces. His crafty technique combined with Moss’ versatility at any position should give the Trojans an edge in the MPSF. 
The Trojans will add the 2018 National Player of the Year and All-CIF Division I Player of the Year in freshman outside hitter Brandon Browning. Browning will have to compete against Wyett and Grasso’s experience and leadership, but his experience playing two years on the USA Volleyball Youth National Team and tenacious effort could sneak him into the lineup. 
“Brandon is the real deal,” Nygaard said. “There is no mystery why he was so highly decorated in high school. He has no real weaknesses for a young player.”
USC will also become home to junior middle blocker and Santa Monica College transfer Vecas Lewin, as well as freshman setter Jameson McKibbin, who is following the steps of his two brothers, uncle and aunt to USC volleyball programs. 
The Men of Troy will head to Honolulu on Jan. 10 to kick off the Hawaiian Airlines Rainbow Warrior Classic against Concordia University.

It was a tale of two halves as an undermanned USC team relied on its defense and veteran leadership to defeat Stanford 77-66 and start Pac-12 play 2-0.
From the 3-point line to inside the paint, Bennie Boatwright was creating offense from everywhere in the second half. After foul trouble kept the senior forward out for much of the first half, Boatwright  attacked in the second, posting 15 of his 22 total points.
“Boatwright played exceptional basketball and he just gave us a calming influence on the offensive end,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “He played like an all-league player.”
USC needed Boatwright’s explosion after halftime as the second half couldn’t have been more different from the first for the Trojans. After allowing just 21 total first-half points, USC allowed 25 Stanford points within the first 10 minutes of the second half. Stanford shot 59 percent from the field and 8-for-18 from deep after halftime.  
“Stanford shoots the ball at such a high level and in the second half they made quite a few of them,” Enfield said.
USC failed to match Stanford’s high shooting level, as the Trojans shot just 4-for-15 from deep and kept the Cardinal in the game for much of the night. Despite struggling to make outside shots, Enfield could depend on the steady hand of junior forward Nick Rakocevic.
“Nick is playing great basketball. He’s really matured,” Enfield said.
“Great basketball” is an understatement for the level of play Rakocevic has been demonstrating since the team entered Pac-12 play.
Rakocevic scored a career-high 27 points to lead the Trojans to a win in their conference opener against California. That hot hand carried over as he then posted 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, making the junior a legitimate contender for Pac-12 Player of the Week. 
Soft hands on pick-and-roll dives and a few quick post moves helped the 6-foot-11 junior forward carry the Trojan offense to start the game. Proving to be a challenge for Stanford’s 6-foot-9 sophomore forward Oscar da Silva and too quick for the 7-foot center Josh Sharma, Rakocevic carried USC’s offense for much of the first half as he posted 12 of his 23 points in the first 10 minutes of the game.
Complementing the big man pairing of Boatwright and Rakocevic was senior point guard Derryck Thornton.
“[Thornton] really controlled the game the last 10, 11 minutes and that’s why we won,” Enfield said.
Thornton followed up on his career-high 12-assist night against California with another impressive outing as the Trojans’ floor general, dished out nine dimes to accompany his 13 points. The senior point guard has accounted for 21 assists in the Trojans’ first pair of conference games.
Offense wasn’t the only way Thornton dictated the game; he and junior guard Jonah Mathews set the tone on the defensive end, operating as the savvy upperclassmen at the top of the 2-3. Pesky defense and filling passing lanes led the upperclassmen duo to four steals and paved the way for 20 points off turnovers for the Trojans.
The Trojans entered conference play with a roster depleted due to injuries to star freshman guards Kevin Porter Jr. (quad) and Elijah Weaver (ankle), along with the transfer of sophomore wing Jordan Usher. But  strong veteran play has allowed USC undefeated two games into Pac-12 play.
The Trojans will head off to their first road game of conference play, as they square off against Oregon State on Jan. 10.

Senior guard and team captain Mariya Moore drives to the basket against Fresno State. (Josh Dunst / Daily Trojan)
Two Pac-12 teams battled for their first conference win on Sunday night at Haas Pavilion when No. 18 Cal defeated USC 66-59.
The Trojans, holding a 10-4 overall record and 0-3 conference record, left with two straight losses in Pac-12 play at Stanford and at home against crosstown rival UCLA. The Bruins also de
feated Cal in an overtime contest on Jan. 4. With this defeat in the books, the Women of Troy have also lost five straight games against Cal.
The Golden Bears pushed to an early lead with 3-pointers from guards freshman McKenzie Forbes, sophomore Kianna Smith and graduate student Receé Caldwell. Senior center Kristine Anigwe, the leading rebounder in the nation, controlled the battle down low against junior forward Kayla Overbeck, forcing her to the bench with two early fouls.  
Senior guard Mariya Moore led all scorers in the first quarter with 10 points, including a last-second 3-point shot from near half-court that trimmed Cal’s lead to 18-15. 
Moore, an All-American at Louisville before transferring to USC two seasons ago, tied the game 18-18 at the beginning of the second quarter after an and-one layup in transition with an assist from younger sister junior guard Minyon Moore. Junior center CJ West, junior forward Jaelyn Brown and Anigwe all dominated the low post for Cal, each scoring and contributing an offensive rebound. 
Mariya Moore continued to shoot well from the perimeter, keeping USC within one possession with under five minutes remaining. Redshirt freshman guard Shalexxus Aaron got on the board in the second quarter with a corner three.
Cal led the rebounding battle 19-11 at halftime, prompting USC head coach Mark Trakh to emphasize rebounding in a timeout halfway through the second quarter. 
Mariya Moore tied the game 29-29 with a near-half court 3-pointer to barely beat the shot clock with two minutes left in the half. But Cal finished the half on a 7-0 run that featured threes from Forbes and senior guard Asha Thomas, extending the lead to 36-29 at halftime.  
Mariya Moore led all scorers with 18 points — the most the Bears have allowed to one player in a half this season. 
The Bears doubled their lead in the first four minutes of the third quarter, forcing a USC timeout during a 15-4 run. Anigwe added another 8 points and five rebounds to her total.
Freshman forward Jillian Archer got on the board for the Trojans in the third quarter, and Mariya Moore hit two more threes to reach her season-high 24 points before the end of the frame.  
“I really didn’t know how many threes I had until after the game when the coach told me,” Mariya Moore said. “I’d rather have not scored if it means we won the game.”  
Cal’s 15-point lead was cutdown to 11 as Moore hit her seventh 3-pointer of the afternoon. Minyon Moore brought it to 7 points with a scoop layup, contributing to a 10-2 run for the Women of Troy to start the fourth quarter.
Anigwe fouled out with five minutes left in the game, finishing as Cal’s leading scorer with 21 points and 16 rebounds. The teams traded baskets as the game winded down. 
Mariya Moore converted two and-one layups in the last two minutes for the Trojans for a career-high 36 points, taking the deficit down to 4 points. However, with 27 seconds remaining, the Trojans were forced to foul and couldn’t secure the comeback. 
In 38 minutes of action, Mariya Moore finished with 36 points, five rebounds and five assists, finishing 7-14 from beyond the arc. 
“[Mariya] did a great job,” Minyon Moore said. “I’m sad we didn’t get the win with her career high. [But] I’m super pr

oud of her that she got back to her groove coming from Louisville. She looked how she’s always looked our whole lives.”
Even with an encouraging performance from Mariya Moore, the loss sticks out for the program. No other player scored more than 6 points, and USC trailed by as many as 18 points in the third quarter. The Women of Troy dug themselves a hole too deep to climb out of.
“If we can just fix the third quarters we can go up against anybody,” Mariya Moore said. “We’re going to continue to fight.”
The Women of Troy will return home to face Oregon at the Galen Center on Jan. 11.

Australian star Nicole Kidman underwent a complete physical transformation to star in Karyn Kusama’s new crime-thriller “Destroyer.” (Photo courtesy of IMDb)
A southern belle, a hard-boiled LAPD officer and the queen of Atlantis; these roles made up Oscar winner Nicole Kidman’s filmography in 2018. Kidman was ever-present on the silver screen this past year with roles in “Boy Erased,” “Aquaman” and now, “Destroyer.”
A neo-noir, heist, revenge and family drama all wrapped up in one, “Destroyer” was screened at Arclight Hollywood’s Cinerama Dome on Saturday followed by a Q&A with the dynamic Kidman herself. 
The very first image of the film is of Nicole Kidman’s stunning physical transformation —  the main thrust of not only the film’s ad campaign but of the film itself. All around her serene blue eyes, Kidman underwent an expertly executed hair and makeup transformation that turned her into a dilapidated shell of a woman who has clearly seen brighter days. 
Kidman, however, welcomed the transformation and chose to go deeper than the physical details of her character.
 “As an actor, I want to become different people,” Kidman said.  “It starts internally and then, once you understand the history and the life story of the character, how does that change the way you walk, move, your skin, your eyes, all of it.” 
Kidman morphed into Erin Bell, an aging cop whose past abruptly springs up on her. While decidedly living in perpetual solitude, the experienced agent must try to fix the fallout of her first undercover mission 17 years prior, when she got too involved with the group of bank robbers she had infiltrated. 
When asked how the role initially came to her, Kidman said, “[The role] didn’t come to me! … it was offered to another actress who decided not to do it. Because I knew [director] Karyn Kusama … I read the script and I said this is something I’d love to make with her.”
Kidman, who is no stranger to dark and dramatic films (“The Killing of a Sacred Deer” and “Eyes Wide Shut” to name a few), admitted that she has never taken on any role quite like Erin Bell. 
“It was a risk, I think, for [Kusama] to cast me in this because there’s nothing in the work I’ve done that would suggest I could do it. So I’m just grateful that she let me jump off the cliff and try.” 
Once the role was hers, Kidman — as she mentioned she does with all of her roles — found an intimate point of entry into the character. As the film progresses, a cathartic storyline emerges between detective Bell and her teenage daughter, who has also been affected by her mother’s decisive absence. Kidman elaborated on this important part of the film. 
“I could feel the damage in her, the pain, but the desire to try to heal the mistakes she’s made that have sabotaged her own life,” Kidman said. “I hope that the idea comes across that you can save or redirect your child’s life.” 
Throughout “Destroyer,” Kidman becomes a classic action star — driving, shooting, running and punching her way through her enemies. 
“The life is sucked out of Erin and she is barely hanging on,” Kidman said. “Yet when she has to fight, she finds this primal survival energy.” 
Kidman’s closing remarks touched on what she currently considers most important in her career and what ultimately compelled her to commit to Kusama’s film.
“I have this huge desire at this stage of my career to help female directors find their way, get their films made, and create more opportunities for them,” Kidman said. 
There was no shortage of applause for Kidman, who that night shined as a hero on and off the screen.

In one of the film’s best sequences, a retro sports bar is turned on its head as Zoey (Taylor Russel) accompanies a group of strangers through the building’s deadly traps.
The recent trend of turning other forms of entertainment into feature-length films has proven to be a largely unsuccessful venture (see: “Battleship,” “The Angry Birds Movie,” etc.)  While “Escape Room” isn’t great, it also isn’t the uninspired drivel that “The Emoji Movie” is. 
From director Adam Robitel, who graduated from USC’s School of Cinematic Arts in 2001, the film follows six strangers who each receive an invitation to participate in an escape room for a $10,000 prize. Of course, upon arrival, they quickly realize that the fun game they were about to play is actually a death trap complete with puzzles they must solve to escape.  
Each room the group encounters contains a creative set piece. The first is a waiting room-turned-oven that starts cooking its occupants alive, quickly followed by a tundra landscape in which the characters must avoid freezing to death. 
The standout room is an upside-down pool bar, where, as time progresses, parts of the floor (ceiling) drop out. The camera flips and rotates often in a set that’s filled with bright colors and retro set pieces, confusing viewers as much as the room confuses the characters. 
The pool bar scene also lends itself to some of the film’s best acting performances. Deborah Ann Woll, who plays a war veteran suffering from PTSD, stands out in particular. Her emotional dexterity throughout the scene brings life to her character, and she becomes a natural leader as she directs the others. 
The other actors in the film include Taylor Russell, a shy college student who becomes the obvious final girl; Tyler Labine, a cheery truck driver; Jay Ellis, an arrogant investment banker; Nik Dodani, a cliche gaming nerd and Logan Miller, a lonely grocery store stock boy. 
Each puzzle is designed around each character’s personal traumas, which eventually reveal the underlying connection between the seemingly random acquaintances. But because the puzzles require knowledge the audience lacks, viewers aren’t able to follow along with the escape room challenges themselves, which feels like a missed opportunity for an otherwise compelling concept. If Netflix makes another interactive film like “Bandersnatch,” an “Escape Room”-style movie where the viewer helps solve the puzzle feels like a natural fit. 
The film draws almost all of its plot from the “Saw” franchise —  like the Jigsaw Killer, the ostensible villain in “Escape Room” designs each puzzle to kill. This comparison is no more obvious than in the movie’s poster, which shows Russel with puzzle pieces missing from her skin. Likewise, Jigsaw’s trademark move was to cut a puzzle piece-shaped chunk out of his victims’ faces after he killed them. It isn’t so much a rip-off as it does draw inspiration, however, each puzzle is unique to the film and doesn’t merely imitate Jigsaw’s antics. 
The PG-13 movie also ditches the gore and fear of “Saw” and other horror films, and it barely qualifies as a horror film due to the lack of, well, horror. Viewers know exactly how a character will die as soon as the film reveals each room’s conceit — the film’s true thrill comes from the suspense of trying to solve the puzzle before time runs out. 
Still, that suspense is thrilling. The potential monotony of following six characters makes it hard to have much dimension at all, but the viewer cares just enough to root for them to make it to the next puzzle. 
Toward the end of the film, the audience learns who’s behind the deadly escape rooms, and it is a largely unsatisfying reveal. The monologue that serves as the reveal’s exposition makes it feel like screenwriters Bragi Schut and Maria Melnik were just looking for an easy reason that the clever conceit of the rest of the film exists at all. 
The ending also spends about 15 minutes (15 minutes too many) very obviously setting up a sequel — it’s a disappointing cap on an otherwise entertaining experience. Still, if “Escape Room” receives a sequel, the franchise has much to build on and improve. While the film’s visuals are stunning and the rooms are creative, the film could benefit from puzzles and storylines that challenge the audience as much as they do the characters.

Lifetime’s limited docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” pulls back the curtain on the famed R&B singer’s allegations of sexual violence and abuse. (Photo courtesy of Lifetime)
Last week’s premiere of the Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” brought back memories of the shameful ways in which our culture failed R. Kelly’s victims and how, by failing to hold him accountable, the black community continues to betray the victims of his manipulation to this day. 
Despite the online media outrage against R. Kelly as the docuseries premiered, per The Blast, his Spotify music streams skyrocketed. One cannot simply separate the music from the musician, especially when the music reflects his heinous actions. R. Kelly has used his music to lure black teenage girls with empty promises of future stardom. He has used his platform as an entertainer to force young girls into countless horrors. Had they occurred in any other country, Americans would deem such behavior barbaric. Had Kelly targeted any other race, national media would cry foul. 
 Robert Sylvester Kelly, otherwise known as R. Kelly, is an American monster.  In his late twenties, his predatory behavior was first brought to light when he illegally married then-15-year-old singer Aaliyah and ordered his tour manager to forge documents saying she was 18. After achieving initial fame, he was known to hang around high schools, where he would pick up students and take them to his studio for sex. 
Then, in 2002, at the height of his career, he filmed himself having sexual relations with a 14-year-old —  the niece of R&B singer Sparkle, with whom he often collaborated. Footage captured him peeing in the young girl’s mouth, yet he was acquitted of all charges. As a result of the verdict, those who denied he was a predator felt their beliefs were justified. His followers perpetuated the idea that his accusers were liars. And yet Kelly had the freedom to prowl once again. 
Perhaps the jury could not fathom that R. Kelly — an artist who had come to define the black musical lexicon —  could be a serial abuser. Or perhaps they didn’t care. Regardless, the impact of his acquittal was immediate. His musical talents triumphed his heinous acts and made him untouchable in the real world — the world where ‘Step in the Name of Love’ is played at every black family gathering and the songs he wrote for Michael Jackson have come to define his legacy. His fans’ unwavering support allows him to keep using social leverage to lure in girls as they provide economic support for him to sustain his predatory behavior. In 2017, Buzzfeed News revealed that R. Kelly has been housing teenage girls in his homes across the country, in what its survivors have described as a sex cult. 
It is imperative that society does their part in demanding justice, so serial abusers are not allowed to strike again. “Surviving R. Kelly” spoke not only of the horrible actions of the singer but also the epidemic he represents. 
However, R. Kelly’s freedom is not only due to his successful music career.  He represents a larger issue regarding young black females in America — nobody believes them and nobody cares when they are left to suffer.
 Since the years of slavery, young black girls have been regarded as more sexual than their white peers. The Center on Poverty and Inequality at the Georgetown Law School published a report titled, “Girlhood Interrupted: The Erase of Black Girls’ Childhood,” which stated that enslaved black children as young as two were often put to work and were severely punished for exhibiting childlike behavior. The paradigms of black femininity, which originated during this time, are still present in modern day society — that black women are aggressive, sexualized beings who exploit men. 
Last year, writer Adrienne Green wrote an essay in The Atlantic titled “How Black Girls Aren’t Presumed to Be Innocent,” in which a study proves that because adults in modern society view black children as less child-like, they thus see them as needing less protection. These harmful stereotypes have allowed for millions of young black girls to become victims of those who take advantage of a knowingly blind-eyed society. Predators use the harmful, false perception regarding the sexualization of Black children as an excuse to abuse them, while others shame the children after the abuse has occurred. The dismissal of predators such as R. Kelly not only shows young Black women that the world does not hear their pain or recognize their suffering — it also shows that the world simply does not care.
The sheer volume of victim blaming that has arisen from the conversations surrounding R. Kelly illustrates how far the Black community must come in its understanding of sexual assault. Accountability must be shifted away from the abused and onto the abuser. Constant dismissal makes the black community complicit in creating harmful environments and causes people to stay silent about their trauma. The Lifetime documentary turned a new page, fostering conversations that many were afraid of having. 
The calls for R. Kelly to be incarcerated have grown louder while he plans his own retaliation against the Lifetime documentary — a website to “expose” his alleged victims and survivors. In the future, monsters like R. Kelly should no longer be given success. This man preyed on girls he thought he could conquer, girls with parents he knew he could manipulate. He knew that he could get away with it, and, so far, he has. His persistence begs the question: How will we respond to the next R. Kelly?

Hollywood was in a good mood Sunday evening as the 76th Annual Golden Globes kicked off the 2019 award show season. Hosts “Killing Eve” star Sandra Oh and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” star Andy Samberg proved to be a formidable comedy duo for “Hollywood’s party of the year.”
The opening monologue featured one of Samberg’s signature acts, the “compliment roast,” in which he praises people in an insulting tone. 
In the vein of Samberg’s awkward and unexpected comedic style, Oh and Samberg delivered some of the strangest highlights of the evening as they poked fun at Ellen DeGeneres’ pizza-giving moment at the Academy Awards years ago by giving out flu shots to the audience. 
Political discussions were not as ubiquitous as in previous years; yet, stars still donned pins and bracelets to pay homage to the #TimesUp movement and used their platforms to push for diversity in Hollywood. Oh became the first Asian woman to host a major American award show and deemed the evening “a moment of change.” Referring to this year’s Globes nominations being the most diverse ever, Oh said, “trust me [this moment is] real because I see you … all these faces of change, and now, so will everyone else.” 
The first big prize of the night came in the animated film category. Usually dominated by Disney, Sony pulled out a win for its universally-lauded “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” which has received acclaim for its Afro-Latino protagonist. 
Although the evening did not see as many awards for “A Star is Born” as many fans had hoped, Lady Gaga and her co-writers were awarded Best Original Song for the chart-topping “Shallow.” She performs the song alongside director and co-star Bradley Cooper in his latest remake of  the classic Hollywood tale, which picked up no other awards for the night even though it was expected to sweep several categories. 
Netflix, however, nabbed some big wins throughout the evening, especially for the critically acclaimed “Roma,” which won Best Foreign Language Film, with its director Alfonso Cuarón taking home Best Director. 
Damien Chazelle’s latest film, “First Man,” pulled out a win last night in the Best Original Score category, despite the film’s absence from mainstream award show conversations.
One of the night’s most memorable events was Regina King taking home her first Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in “If Beale Street Could Talk.” In her speech, she vowed that everything she produces going forward would be composed of at least 50 percent women and challenged others to follow suit. The night was topped with Sandra Oh’s historic victory as the first person of Asian descent to win multiple Golden Globes, including a win as Best Actress in a Television Series Drama, making her the first woman of Asian descent to win the award since 1981.
As the evening went on, Mahershala Ali won Best Supporting actor for his role in “Green Book.” Ali was expected by most to take home the Golden Globe this year after the HFPA failed to recognize him for his Academy-Award winning role in 2016’s “Moonlight.” However, the film “Green Book” fared better than most expected, also taking home Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, despite widespread criticism that it contained a clichéd racial plot.
Other notable snubs included the Globes’ failure to recognize “Mary Poppins Returns,” “Vice” and Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman,” his most celebrated work in recent years.  
Then there were the true shocks of the night, such as Chuck Lorre’s “The Kominsky Method” winning Best Television Comedy Series over “The Good Place.” Perhaps the biggest upset of the night was “Bohemian Rhapsody” winning Best Motion Picture Drama, stunning critics and fans alike due to its association with its credited director and accused child abuser, Bryan Singer. The win left many people wondering how the HFPA could award that film over others like “A Star is Born,” and left others to ponder whether Hollywood has truly changed at all.   
 Despite all the shocking upsets, newcomers — often favored by the HFPA — made out well, such as Richard Madden who won for his role in the television series “Bodyguard.” 
Still, in all this, there was nothing about the ceremony itself to be remembered the next day. Perhaps, with all the controversy, scandals and purging Hollywood has been dealing with for the past two years, basic is exactly what they were looking for.
