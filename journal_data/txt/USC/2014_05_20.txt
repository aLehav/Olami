Redshirt junior quarterback Max Wittek intended to use his final two years of Football Bowl Subdivision eligibility as a college football player at a school other than USC, but failed to graduate this past spring, narrowing his window of opportunity to play in the fall.
After losing out to the Trojan’s current starting quarterback redshirt junior Cody Kessler in the Trojans’ 2013 campaign and not getting much playing time in 2014, Wittek made the decision to graduate with his degree and play his final two years of college football elsewhere.
Instead of graduating this past spring, however, Wittek will be graduating in December, which means that he will not be eligible to play in the fall at an FBS school and will be required to sit out a year per NCAA transfer rules. This will give Wittek only one year of remaining eligibility. Head coach Charlie Strong and Texas had halted their plans to bring in Wittek for an undisclosed reason earlier, though the reason can now be presumed to be Wittek’s eligibility to play in the fall.
If Wittek elected to drop down a level and transfer to a Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) school, he would keep two years of eligibility.
The 6-foot-4, 235 pound quarterback got his first opportunity for a start when former USC quarterback Matt Barkley dislocated his shoulder in the penultimate regular season game against UCLA in 2012.
Wittek will be most widely remembered by fans for guaranteeing a victory in that first start against the then-No. 1 Fighting Irish, and his failure to lead an offense stocked with talented offensive weapons to victory against Georgia Tech in the 2012 Sun Bowl. Windy conditions prevailed in El Paso and the Trojan offense was impotent with Wittek under center, with the quarterback completing a mere 14 of his 37 passes for 107 yards, USC’s lone touchdown, and three interceptions.
Like Barkley, Wittek was highly recruited out of Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California. The Contra Costa, California native grew up with former USC running back Silas Redd in Norwalk, Connecticut before moving back to California to play quarterback at Mater Dei. Other FBS schools who could potentially be in the market for Wittek’s services regardless of his lone year of remaining eligibility include Louisville and Pittsburgh.

Three former USC players were drafted and eight more were signed to free agent contracts earlier this month as one of the most exciting and unpredictable NFL Drafts in recent memory unfolded at Radio City Music Hall in New York.
Prepared for the pros · Wide receiver Marqise Lee was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
As expected, wide receiver Marqise Lee became the first USC player selected in the 2014 class when the Jacksonville Jaguars made him the 39th overall pick. Lee, who won the Biletnikoff Award after a record-breaking sophomore campaign, was seen as a surefire first round selection going into 2013. Instead, an injury-plagued and relatively unproductive season forced him into the second round. Going into this year’s draft, many still predicted Lee would land in the first round, rating him among the top four prospects at his position. Instead, five receivers were drafted ahead of him, including Sammy Watkins of Clemson and Brandin Cooks of Oregon State. Still, the Inglewood, Calif. native joins a team focused on retooling its offense, specifically through the air. The Jaguars shocked the world by drafting Central Florida quarterback Blake Bortles with the third overall pick, just two months after trading their previous franchise signal caller Blaine Gabbert.
For the Trojan faithful, the first two rounds of this year’s draft were eerily familiar. Both 2013 and 2014 saw former USC standouts slip out of the first round after disappointing play in their final collegiate seasons. Even more interestingly, both saw dynamic Trojan receivers selected at “bargain” values early in the second round. Last year, Robert Woods went to the Buffalo Bills with the 41st pick, a selection that many considered a steal after his excellent rookie season. It remains to be seen whether Lee can once again follow the model of his former teammate.
Lee and center Marcus Martin were invited to sit beside the stage at Radio City, where both anxiously waited for commissioner Roger Goodell to call their names. For Martin the wait would last into the third round, when he was finally selected by the San Francisco 49ers with the 70th overall pick. It was certainly not all bad news for Martin, who joins a team that has appeared in the NFC Championship game three years running. The Los Angeles native, who started each of his three seasons at USC and was named a Freshman All-American by the Sporting News in 2011, will have to fight for playing time on an experienced San Francisco offensive line.
The Trojans’ remaining selection was linebacker Devon Kennard, who landed with the New York Giants in the fifth round. Kennard was a versatile defender who also saw time at defensive end, allowing him to play significant amounts in each of his three seasons at USC. After a chest injury allowed him a medical redshirt in 2012, Kennard settled at outside linebacker last season and led his team with 13.5 tackles per loss.
Many other NFL hopefuls on the Trojans’ 2013 roster will still get an opportunity to continue at the next level. Defensive end Morgan Breslin, who missed the end of last season due to injury, will join Martin in San Francisco on a free agent contract. Kennard’s Giants added tight end Xavier Grimble, whose draft stock plummeted after a poor performance at USC’s Pro Day. Also headed to the NFC East are offensive tackle Kevin Graf, who signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, and running back Silas Redd. The Penn State transfer will return to the Beltway after joining the Washington Redskins. Defensive tackle George Uko signed with the New Orleans Saints, while safety Demetrius Wright is headed to the Miami Dolphins.
Former Trojan head coach Pete Carroll and the Seattle Seahawks offered contracts to safety Dion Bailey and guard John Martinez. In all, five of the 11 USC players headed to the next level will be playing for former Pac-12 head coaches: two to Carroll, two to Jim Harbaugh in San Francisco, and another to Chip Kelly in Philadelphia.

The No. 1 seeded USC men’s tennis team secured the NCAA Men’s Tennis Championship in dramatic fashion Tuesday against the No. 2 seeded Oklahoma Sooners at Dan Magill Tennis Complex in Athens, Georgia.  The Trojans, who lost the doubles point and fell behind early 2-0, charged back with the one-two punch of senior Ray Sarmiento and junior Yannick Hanfmann to pick up the championship, 4-2.

Sophomore Max de Vroome clinched the final point for the Trojans against Sooner Andrew Harris. The Netherlands native played an aggressive third set, approaching the net often and pushing Harris—and the Sooners’ national title hopes—against the wall.  In the final game of final set with de Vroome up three championship points, the Trojan sophomore showed signs of nerves in the face of massive pressure. On consecutive points, De Vroome hit two shots long from the baseline to put Harris in a position to force deuce. De Vroome recalled the moment in a postgame press conference.
“There’s so much going through your mind, but seeing your teammates and the coaches next to your court, they help you through. There’s no way I could have done it without them,” de Vroome said. “It’s just fighting for them.”
With the weight of a trophy squarely on his shoulders, the 6-foot-5 sophomore calmed himself at 40-30 and returned to the formula that had allowed him to dominate the third set: he served up a monster and approached the net, neutralizing Harris’ equally strong return with a lethal backhand volley down the ad side line to stun the 53rd-ranked Sooner and clinch the championship. The horns of the Trojan Marching Band blared “Conquest” into the warm evening air at Dan Magill Tennis Complex as De Vroome was mobbed by his exuberant teammates.
The championship did not come easy for the Trojans, who got off to a shaky start by losing the doubles point. In singles play, junior Roberto Quiroz suffered a tough loss to Oklahoma’s Dane Webb in line three, 6-1, 6-2 to give the Sooners a 2-0 lead. The Trojans’ fortunes would quickly change, however, as junior Yannick Hanfmann dismantled the No. 5 ranked player in the nation, opponent Guillermo Alcorta on line one, 7-5, 6-2, and Sarmiento wrapped up business on line two with a 6-4, 7-6(4) victory over No. 7 ranked Axel Alvarez.
Sarmiento began his match down 1-3 in the first set as Alvarez launched an offensive incorporating some brilliant shot making and improvisation.
“I dug myself a pretty big hole there at the beginning,” Sarmiento said. “But since day one coach has emphasized leaving it all out there on the court. Whatever happens, happens, I’m just competing my butt off.”
And something happened — Sarmiento raged back, stringing together multiple sets and service breaks to stun Alvarez 6-4 in the first set. The senior captain’s exceptional balance and footwork was on display throughout the final round, and as the match wore on, Alvarez looked at a loss as to how to compete with Sarmiento’s composure and devastatingly accurate shots.
Junior Eric Johnson put the Trojans up 3-2 with his 6-1, 7-6 victory at line five. The clinching match was a race between senior Michael Grant at line six, who held a 4-2 advantage in the third set of his match against Alex Ghilea, and sophomore de Vroome at line four.
Tuesday’s victory also marked USC head coach Peter Smith’s fifth NCAA title with the Trojans, his first four coming in a historic “four-peat” from 2009 to 2012. Smith, the 2012 ITA National Coach of the Year, was complimentary of the Oklahoma Sooners and their coach John Roddick, who on Tuesday was named the 2014 ITA National Coach of the Year.
“We had all played these guys a couple times,” Smith said. “We knew exactly who they were. Let me tell you something; John Roddick and Oklahoma Sooners were a class act out there.”
USC’s title was also a milestone for the Trojan family at large: it was the 100th NCAA team title for USC’s athletic program. The Trojans’ 84 Division I men’s team titles are the most in the nation.
UPDATE: Due to publishing deadlines, an abridged version of this article ran in the print edition of the Summer Trojan.
Congrats to the tennis team for a stirring victory. One question is what happened to
Johnny Wang the last part of the season? Fight On!

The Beverly Grove area is a dining destination for most seasoned Angelenos. Home to the historic 24-hour deli Canter’s and power-dinner staples such as A.O.C., Animal and Son of a Gun, this is not a training ground for culinary amateurs. Thankfully, Chef Adel Chagar is no amateur; his Moroccan deli concept, Chameau, was a huge hit with savvier locals. The couscous and duck bastilla were rave-worthy, and anyone who wanted a little Moroccan food in their life would find a refined iteration of the culture’s cuisine tucked away on Fairfax Avenue.
Finger lickin’ · Bird N Hand’s Harissa-spiced chicken wings are the perfect balance of a nice savory heat and sweetness. It pairs excellently with Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, which is sold by the can and served in a mason jar. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
It comes with a bit of surprise, then, that Chagar shuttered Chameau, renovated the restaurant, and tried his hand with the more glitzy Bird N Hand, which opened earlier this month. The new restaurant’s chicken-focused offerings and hip décor fit more snugly into the area’s overall dining landscape, and should be a welcome addition to the dining options on Fairfax Avenue.
Upon approaching the restaurant, the restaurant’s concept becomes immediately apparent — a large storefront window stands ajar, with the restaurant’s laid-back, porch-picnic ambiance seemingly spilling out onto the sidewalk. Pop art-inspired profiles of a rooster line the walls and attractive recessed lighting illuminates the main dining area. The chic-picnic concept is just in time for the warm California summer.
None of this would matter from a business standpoint if Chagar wasn’t putting equally good food to prop up his concept, and Bird N Hand, while slightly inconsistent, delivers the goods. The entrees use exclusively free-range chickens in a myriad of preparations, including flavored wings, chicken “tall boy” sandwiches, garlic lemon roasted chicken and, of course, the obligatory fried chicken.
Bird N Hand’s rendition of the classic American finger food is a master class in chicken wing execution. An order of spicy Harissa Wings arrives with four full wings (drumette and wing) to a basket, garnished with batons of celery and carrots. The wings themselves are healthily sized, significantly larger than the ones found at the typical Wing Stop or Buffalo Wild Wings. Size isn’t the only improvement here, though. The gently battered wings are dressed up with carefully concocted sauces.
The Harissa spiced wings have a restrained heat balanced with sweetness. The gentle kick of spice will make diners reach for a cold Pabst Blue Ribbon beer (sold by the can and served in bright blue mason jars). The wings themselves are incredibly juicy and packed with succulent meat, making four pieces a filling order for one — or order both the Harissa and Szechwan wings and share. The less spicy, yet equally tasty “Asian barbecue” sauce-laden Szechwan wing balances soy and sweetness and manages to stay from being too salty. It’s this type of thoughtful attention to detail and execution that elevates Bird N Hand from a mere dressed-up Wing Stop to a truly refined wing-eating experience.
The side dishes, however, reveal some cracks in Bird N Hand’s armor. Tater tots have a satisfying crunch and are an able replacement for French fries (which are also available), but a puzzling gnocchi and cheese dish is confused from concept to palate. On paper, gnocchi and cheese sounds like a brilliant reinvention of the traditional macaroni and cheese dish. It presents itself as such, replete with a baked panko breadcrumb topping. But the gnocchi is steeped in a cheese sauce that doesn’t add any nuttiness or appetizing textures, instead shrouding the palate with the funk of missed opportunity.
Another surprising side dish is the inclusion of waffles on the menu; but the execution here is top-notch. A quartered waffle arrives attractively arranged in a row on one of Bird N Hand’s ubiquitous baskets, and the textures employed by Chagar are evidence of a superior attention to detail. The waffle is crunchy and nutty on the outside and light and airy on the inside. They would be an excellent complement to the restaurant’s fried chicken.
Unfortunately for those seeking an upscale chicken-and-waffles experience at Bird N Hand, the fried chicken reveals a potential area for improvement; the meat is certainly succulent and moist, but the batter manifests in a cracker-crunchy shell, and the combination of the two elements is oddly disconcerting. The skin and meat seem to exist exclusive of one another, failing to create the textural synergy that is fundamentally expected of a solid fried chicken.
Things pick up with the “tall boy” sandwiches — the carbohydrate-laden bombs consist of a fried chicken thigh, Harissa mayonnaise, coleslaw and a hash brown served up on a pillowy brioche bun. They taste every bit as good as they sound, with the crunchiness of the chicken thigh and coleslaw playing excellently against their soft brioche vessels.
If some of the dishes seemed to stumble, Bird N Hand makes a marvelous landing at dessert. The bravely named Croissant Crack Pudding nearly undersells its addictive promise. What sounds too rich and too sweet at first glance is neatly restrained by a slightly bitter and deep, earthy dark chocolate and a masterfully executed bread pudding. Chagar again plays with a balance of texture, topping the soft bread pudding with a flaky croissant crust and rounding out the proceedings with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. The resultant dessert is a mind-bending ending to an incredibly solid meal.
Despite being surrounded by such culinary heavyweights in the Beverly Grove district, Bird N Hand can more than hold its own. Its casual concept pairs more-than-fair prices with execution worthy of upscale-dining. Chameau’s excellence was under-appreciated, but Chagar’s true winner might be the humble chicken dinner.

When Coldplay announced that its latest album would be entitled Ghost Stories, it was intriguing. After all, truly great ghost stories excite the imagination and keep people up at night. Coldplay’s Ghost Stories are not these kinds of stories. Unfortunately, the only person losing sleep in Ghost Stories is lead singer Chris Martin. At its best, the latest effort from the band is eminently listenable and emotionally evocative — but the vast majority of the tracks could also cure insomnia.
The album’s artwork — an image of two wings suspended over water — is better viewed from a distance, where it looks like the shape of a heart “consciously uncoupled” down the middle. Such heartbreak is the concept album’s thesis.
On first listen, you will want to love Ghost Stories. Because for all of its tragic, timeless (and tragically timeless) themes of heartbreak, for every cringe-worthy lyric Martin penned about estranged baby mama Gwyneth Paltrow (“And if you were to ask me / After all that we’ve been through / ‘Still believe in magic?’ / Yes, I do” on “Magic”), there’s a belief that the big “drop” is coming.
You will want to believe that the melancholy timbre that seems to open almost every track on the album will eventually blossom into a sonic boom of ominous electric guitar chords, cymbal crashes and Chris Martin straining his falsetto on a catchy chorus, like in 2000’s Parachutes. You will hope that Martin would find a way to muster a dry response to adversity, like in 2002’s A Rush of Blood to the Head, or signify triumph with the saccharine optimism of 2011’s Mylo Xyloto. Barring one completely unwelcome instance of the latter, there will be no such luck.
Ghost Stories opens with “Always In My Head,” where dreamy synthesizers cut in with muffled voices murmuring nothing in particular — it’s a shaky start, and that’s what the band wants to get across conceptually. “Another’s Arms” gives the band a bit more footing. Instead of Coldplay’s tried and true verse-chorus-verse structure, the chorus is replaced by angelic, wordless female vocals. It’s one of the more solid tracks on the album.
But it’s the haunting single “Midnight” that best sums up this album’s musical aesthetic. Martin’s delicate crooning is contrasted by an Auto-Tune effect that contributes harmony and creates a sleepy, droning-robot effect reminiscent of a downtempo Bon Iver. “Leave a light on,” Martin harmoniously pleads over a humming bass and sparse synth staccatos. The entire track builds up to a noticeably restrained climax, where Jon Harper’s synths busily drive the backbeat. Martin abruptly cuts the festivities short, transitioning out with his Auto-Tuned voice again.
In spite of the glacial pacing and deeply personal lyrics on much of the album, Ghost Stories is not above self-indulgent pop-rock pandering. The Avicii-assisted penultimate track, “A Sky Full of Stars,” thrusts forward with an uplifting barrage of piano chords that build up to the EDM producer’s trademark stadium-size synth riffs. It’s the closest thing to an uptempo track on this record — and it’s completely out of place on Ghost Stories.
“Magic,” a sparse, acoustic foot-tapper, is driven by a boom-bap drum loop and proves pretty listenable. It also happens to be peppered with some of the band’s most insufferably simplistic lyrics. Lines like “Call it magic / When I’m with you / And I just got broken / Broken into two” are elementary even by Coldplay standards. Luckily where the band fails in writing, Martin succeeds rhythmically and vocally by the virtue of his excellent falsetto.
If Coldplay’s intent was to be a vehicle for the troubled Martin on Ghost Stories, it succeeds — this is easily the band’s most personal work, which for Coldplay isn’t saying very much. An emotionally fractured Martin stumbles into a misty forest of uncertainty and, over the course of nine tracks, emerges with a guarded acceptance of his circumstances.
Against the bombast of Mylo Xyloto, it’s certainly good to hear the old stripped-down Coldplay with some emotional depth again. And yet there’s no range in tactical dynamics here to contrastively highlight the band’s use of restraint; everything seems withdrawn and pensive, and the lyrics lack a confessional quality which would have comfortably suited the overall thematic direction. Chris Martin’s lyrics aren’t so much nebulous or intriguing as they are flat-out generic; and maybe that’s the problem. The album comes off as a 42-minute exclusive mea culpa to the lead singer’s estranged wife — it also just happens to function on its own legs as a breakup album.
Thankfully for Coldplay, change is the only true constant. Just as Ghost Stories was a departure from Mylo Xyloto, it’s reassuring to think the next album will be another similarly huge departure. Let’s just hope — for everyone’s sake — that the next album doesn’t involve another breakup.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Saturday, May 17, and Monday, May 19. 
Crimes against a person
at 2:58 p.m. on May 17, two students reported that a non-USC male who lives at the same residence came into their rooms and slapped them both in the face without provocation. The male told DPS officers that he did in fact slap one of the students, but could not remember slapping the other. He admitted to suffering from mental health issues and per his own request was transferred to the California Hospital for psychiatric evaluation.
Crimes against property
at 4:48 p.m. on May 19, DPS responded to complaints that support beams within the parking garage at the Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity house had been spray painted with graffiti.
at 8:15 p.m. on May 19, a student reported he witnessed a suspect remove his laptop from his backpack at Starbucks while he was picking up his coffee from the counter. A second suspect held open the door for the first and they both fled with the computer. The student and a friend pursued them both and the suspect dropped the computer when the student caught up to him.

While most students were rushing to submit final papers and review for upcoming exams, Alejandra Cortez, a graduate student pursuing a master’s degree in social work, was working to improve local political participation in her community.

That’s just one of the many responsibilities now for the 24-year-old Los Angeles native, who just last month was elected onto the Board of Councilors for the L.A. neighborhood Cypress Park.
As a student of social work, Cortez has long held a desire to return to her neighborhood after graduating and make a positive difference.
“I’ve always had that mentality of going back to my community and changing it — of making it better,” she said.
Only two-and-a-half miles north of Downtown Los Angeles, Cypress Park is a predominantly Latino community with around 11,000 residents.
Its past has been negatively marked by gang-related activity, and Cortez recalled that in one of her social work classes at USC, a visiting LAPD officer showed a map of gang-related hot spots, and one of those areas was her very own Cypress Park.
“I’m sitting in my class going, ‘Wait — that’s where I live,’” Cortez said.
From then on, Cortez realized that her neighborhood required some drastic change. The question of how exactly she was going to do that, however, remained.
Her search ended this year when a friend told Cortez about the local Neighborhood Council, a nine-member board meant to advocate for the surrounding community. Cortez remarked that, like many in the area, she had never heard of it.
“Someone told me about the Neighborhood Council and I didn’t even know about it,” Cortez said. “But I started going to the [Neighborhood Council] meetings and realized it was a good way to start giving back to my community.”
After filing as a candidate, she went door-to-door and business-to-business, encouraging those within Cypress Park to get out and vote. All her hard work eventually paid off — in the April 26th election, Cortez garnered 113 votes, more than any other of the elected councilors.
In her first order of business, Cortez plans to change the trend of apathy toward local politics through encouraging both youth involvement and word-of-mouth campaigning.
“There’s a large population of youth in the community but they’re not aware of the [potential] resources,” she said. “I want to advocate for this community which doesn’t really have a voice.”
It can be easy to forget, however, that Cortez herself is also part of that young demographic. She often finds herself surprised that her dream to give back to the neighborhood has come true so soon.
“I always knew after I graduated that I wanted to give back to my community, but now it’s happened so fast,” Cortez said. “I wasn’t expecting the opportunity to do it so quickly.”
Nevertheless, the young politician is ready to hit the ground running. She has expressed interest in being vice president of the Council and envisions great potential in putting Cypress Park on the map.
“Within my district, a lot of the communities are up and rising,” Cortez said. “They went from being gang-related to the ‘place to be.’ [For Cypress Park] It’s about starting small — cleaning it up, making it more appealing to people, and using resources from within.”
With a two-year term ahead of her, Cortez just might have the time needed to see her vision through.
“It’s definitely a turning point and I’m excited to see where the community can go,” Cortez said.

Thousands of friends, family and guests of the 2014 graduating class gathered in front of Doheny Library last  Friday morning for the 131st Annual Commencement Ceremony.
Trojan send-off · Keynote speaker Marc Benioff challenged the class of 2014 to give back to others and break down barriers — both literal and figurative — from the outside world. Benioff is a ‘SC alumnus and current CEO of the cloud computing website salesforce.com. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Withstanding sweltering temperatures, the crowd stretched from the steps of Doheny back to Bovard Auditorium. President C.L. Max Nikias kicked off the ceremony by noting the tentative future that lie before the graduates.
“The class of 2014 are graduating into times of uncertainty … but what is uncertainty?” Nikias said. “Uncertainty is the beginning of a great adventure.”
Nikias stressed that no matter where life led the students, the USC family would be by their side.
“The Trojans always seize destiny,” Nikias said. “Remember: You do not go forward alone, but with the global Trojan family.”
Nearly 16,000 students earned diplomas on Friday, and Nikias also conferred six honorary degrees to preeminent leaders in his or her respective field, including entrepreneur and philanthropist Marc Benioff, CEO and founder of salesforce.com; USC trustee and founder of Public Storage B. Wayne Hughes; television executive producer and USC alumna Shonda L. Rhimes; Nobel laureate biologist and biochemist Phillip A. Sharp; mathematician and philanthropist James A. Simons and choreographer and dancer Twlya Tharp.
Much of the ceremony took on a theme of service — stressing the importance of giving back to the surrounding community and the world at large.
The Class of 2014 Valedictorian Jana Shapiro used her speech to reflect on the past four years, and stressed that the graduates should provide change and support no matter where life takes them.
“Let’s cultivate a Trojan culture of action and spread it wherever we go,” Shapiro said.
The ceremony’s keynote address was given by entrepreneur and philanthropist Mark Benioff, best known as the CEO and founder of the cloud computing website salesforce.com.
Benioff, a USC alumnus and trustee, reflected that after graduating from the university he took a job at Oracle Corporation, but after ten years felt lost and frustrated with his life.
“A decade went by and all of a sudden I felt kind of unmotivated, not energized, not very excited, not very inspired,” Benioff said.
He took a trip to south India with a friend of his, and during his journey he engaged with a guru who imparted wisdom on Benioff that would dictate the rest of his life.
“[She told us,] don’t forget to do something for others,” Benioff said. “I felt that I had found what I was looking for. She said that don’t forget — while we’re changing the world — don’t forget about others who are a little less well taken care of. “
That piece of advice stuck with Benioff, and it was something he stressed for the class of 2014. Referencing the university’s fencing from the outside community, he closed his speech by encouraging the graduates not to isolate themselves from those in need.
“We drove through some high fences and high gates [today] and we all know why — because only a few blocks from here are some of the most impoverished people in the world,” Benioff said.  “Don’t let those walls be a metaphor for your own life — get out there and do something for others.”

As the summer for students at the University of Southern California begins, the school year is still winding to an end for kids within the Los Angeles Unified School District. When I was in middle school and high school, those three months of summer break that laid ahead of me were ideal for spending all of my time outside in the warm weather or watching as many hours of Disney Channel as I could. But in City Hall and among officials at LAUSD, they are hoping that Los Angeles’ students’ summer schedules will be filled with more educational and career-focused activities than they have in the past.
Last week, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced the creation of the Summer of Learning program. The program, which is directed at both younger and older students, is a partnership between his office and LAUSD that aims to enhance their science, technology, engineering, arts and math skills, as well as provide them with job-readiness training, according to the Los Angeles Times. The program will be structured through both online and in-person classes. The program website went live yesterday, and sign-ups for those classes will begin June 6.
During the announcement of the new summer program, the mayor of the city with the nation’s second-largest school district said that it was imperative for students to be involved in a structured program, similar to school, over the summer. “We imagine that we all start at the starting line as equals, but we don’t. The Summer Learning program will seek to close a gap across the city, based on your ZIP code,” Garcetti said.
Based off of the number of students who receive free or reduced meals at LAUSD schools, more than 80 percent of the students eligible for this summer program come from low-income families. Many of the families cannot afford to send their students to expensive summer camps. Therefore, the Summer of Learning is an ideal opportunity to provide a summer camp experience to students while also incorporating educational institutions and using the city as the classroom. Mayor Garcetti said the program would include outings to classic Los Angeles spots, such as the Getty Center.
Though traditionally summer was viewed as a break from the rush of school, many are beginning to view these three untarnished months as an opportunity to catch up on, get ahead in and review lessons that are not given enough time during the regular school year. With these changes in the pace of the world and the extra demands being put on children, the new summer program offered to Los Angeles students is essential to keeping the city a bustling and educated one.
A summer program like this is also valuable because it aligns with the goals of the school district and larger goals of the city as a whole. The city has been debating and testing ways to close the digital gap between students from disadvantaged neighborhoods and more privileged areas for several years. The recent failings and setbacks from the iPad rollout in the beginning of the 2013-14 school year was part of this. With the digital aspect of the Summer of Learning program, however, students will receive digital badges to track their progression and successes. This will lead to more students using technology during their time off from school — a time that might have had certain students go without access to technological tools like some of their other counterparts.
According to the American Camp Association survey from 2011, 63 percent of parents who had students involved in camp and enrichment programs over the summer said that their child continued to participate in the activities they learned at camp. In the same vein, the more students involved in the Summer of Learning program learning key skills in the arts and sciences as well as picking up interviewing and cooking skills, the more young adults there will be in the city developing those skills year-round. Hopefully this will lead them down career paths, or even to lifelong passions and hobbies.
For a program like this to be successful, support from all sectors of the city has to be behind it.
Therefore when the city and mayor’s office begin offering summer programs for all students, the city must take heed. When investments in the future — through educating and nurturing Los Angeles students all year round — are made, then everyone has an obligation to make sure the program is working to its best ability, reaching out to as many students as possible and actually preparing the minds of the city’s future stakeholders for the coming years.

This past Sunday marked a special day in the lives of many young adults as they graduated from the graduate and undergraduate degree programs of thousands of accredited American higher education institutions. If you were unaware, you need only check Instagram newsfeeds for a bombardment of images of graduates celebrating their final moments of collegiate life. Watching the news, however, will demonstrate a much less positive aspect of this year’s graduating classes than the smiling #selfies on Facebook. A growing trend of liberal intolerance towards graduation speakers has cast a dark shadow on this year’s commencements and the future of higher education. Due to protests by both students and professors at several universities, many bright, knowledgeable and acclaimed leaders of the political and business worlds have opted not to appear at the graduations to which they were originally invited, or have been uninvited altogether.
Rather than debasing the speakers, as the protesters might hope, these actions largely discredit the universities, both in terms of their intellectual prestige and their professionalism. A student is clearly not ready to enter the professional world if they are willing to “protest the war in Iraq” by openly rejecting former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice from delivering a commencement address.
While Rice’s experiences as a minority woman with an illustrious career in American politics make her perfectly qualified to deliver an address to a liberal arts institution like Rutgers University, the protests caused Rice to decline her invitation to this year’s commencement. When these Rutgers students of the Class of 2014 were finishing their freshman year back in April 2011, however, the Rutgers University Programming Association paid $32,000 to bring Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi of “Jersey Shore” fame to campus to speak to students, according to the New York Post. While turning away the first female black Secretary of State when just three years ago they welcomed the first American to get trashed and arrested in a foreign country on television could certainly tarnish their reputation, these embarrassing decisions are becoming a trend.
Another big story of this year’s graduation controversies happened at Smith College, when commencement speaker Christine Lagarde announced that she would not be attending the institution’s graduation ceremony for similar reasons as Rice. Lagarde had been fervently protested by Smith faculty and students for her position as the International Money Fund (IMF) managing director, according to MSNBC. While Lagarde could potentially have given a powerful address, the professors and students at Smith condemned her as an individual due to her short-term association with the IMF.
Today’s students often take the greatest offense to the smallest of things. For instance, Sen. Michael Johnston, the commencement speaker for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, was protested by students because of a minor political standpoint he held — he “embraces a vision of education reform that relies heavily on test-based accountability while weakening the due process protections of teachers.” In spite of previous political decisions defending teachers, the graduate students at Harvard submitted a written proposal to have Johnston removed from the ceremony and to more scrupulously screen graduation speakers, according to the Washington Post. It is a wonder that, in this nation of polarizing issues and intellectual hostility, there remain any viable college speakers of importance at all. The commencement speaker at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, Sheryl WuDunn, even prefaced her address by saying, “Thank you for inviting me here, or rather thank you for not disinviting me.”
The New York Times and Los Angeles Times reported that similar situations occurred at Haverford College in Pennsylvania and Pasadena City College in California. Also in the news was the commencement speaker this year for the graduating class of the Oklahoma City Police Academy, who had been threatened by right-wing gun supporters for his position on gun ownership. Timothy Egan of The New York Times said, “the lefty thought police at Smith, Haverford and Rutgers share one thing with the knuckle-dragging hard right in Oklahoma: They’re afraid of hearing something that might spoil a view of the world they’ve already figured out.”
Though all of the uninvited or disheartened speakers this year hold controversial positions within America’s social, political, business and collegiate systems, the task that they were originally contacted to perform — the commencement address — is far from a propaganda technique. Rather, each and every one of these professionals would have offered advice to the students, families and faculty with tact. They would have tried to inspire the excited and scared former students, and they probably could have done so a bit more competently than Snooki, who gave Rutgers students this piece of advice: “Study hard, but party harder!”
