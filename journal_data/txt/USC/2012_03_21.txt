The Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism is launching One School, One Book, an initiative that aims to bring students, faculty and staff together as a community and will hold its first event on Thursday.
Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide was selected, and a discussion will be held Thursday by Henry Jenkins, the book’s author, and four of his graduate students.
The program looks to unify students and faculty by enabling them to read, interpret and discuss the contents of one book that highlights issues relevant to the school.
“It’s supposed to provide an opportunity for all Annenberg students to have a common experience of reading the same book,” Annenberg Associate Dean Abby Kaun said. “We select the book on [topics] we think are important and of interest to our students and to our faculty.”
A forum will be held for each book to allow students to engage with one another.
Annenberg intends to continue the program over the summer for entering and returning students.
“We’ll announce it to incoming students, so before they even get to the Annenberg school, they can be reading the book too,” Kaun said. “We’d love to have some sort of online discussion of the book even before students get here, and then what we hope to do is not just have one big event around the book, but to possibly have other programming connected to whatever the book is.”
Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide looks at how business, politics, education and religion are shaped by the ways people engage with popular culture.
“The book is structured around a series of case studies of media properties of Survivor, of American Idol, of The Matrix, of Harry Potter and of the presidential elections before 2008,” said author Henry Jenkins, a professor of communication, journalism and cinematic arts. “We’re trying to look at the relationship [between] old media and the new relationship consumers are forming to digital media, networking and communications.”
The book also aims to differentiate between old and new media and what the connection between both means.
“When we talk about new media and participatory culture, we’re talking about communications that more people can produce and share with each other,” Jenkins said. “Lots of new ideas diversify the culture, and those ideas often then get amplified and they get taken up by broadcast media, and that in the way is the intersection; it’s how our ideas fly from one to the other.”
Seems like popular media entertainment culture, such as television and movies.   Why not a subject related to communication (discussion of a subject) and/or  journalism (presentation of a subject)?   Just asking.

The Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to approve a redistricting plan that would move USC to the 9th District.
Los Angeles County requires district lines to be redrawn every 10 years. The area that will now be within the boundaries of District 9, which is represented by City Councilmember Jan Perry, includes the University Park Campus, University Village, Exposition Park and the Coliseum.
Thomas Sayles, senior vice president of university relations, said USC is satisfied with this change.
“The only request we made was that we be placed in a single district. We want to be treated like any other college in Los Angeles, and we are happy that we are now in one district,” Sayles said.
Sayles said, portions of USC were previously in both the 8th and 9th Districts.
City Councilmember Bernard C. Parks, who represents District 8, said USC’s request to be in one district was legitimate, but he disagrees with the overall redistricting decision. Parks also said he and other councilmembers have pledged to take legal action if Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa signs the redistricting proposal.
“I think [USC] is going to be a part of a legal battle,” Parks said. “These changes were made without any community input. None of this was requested by anyone in the 8th or 9th Districts.”
Parks said moving to District 9 might delay the university’s plans for expansion and renovation. He said USC’s current and future projects might not receive the same attention from District 9 officials as they did when situated in District 8.
“We have worked for three to four years on these projects,” Parks said. “Moving to a new district would be starting from scratch.”
“Parks said moving to District 9 might delay the university’s plans for expansion and renovation.”

By the second day of being uploaded to YouTube, Invisible Children’s 30-minute Kony 2012 video increased views by the millions and has totaled to more than 84 million as of Wednesday.
The video, released to raise awareness about child soldiers, was most watched by people under age 30 who heard about the video on the Internet, according to a Pew Research Center study.
Of the 58 percent of Millenials — those under the age of 30 — who said they heard about the video, 36 percent learned about the video through the Internet. In comparison, of the 50 percent of adults polled between the ages of 30 and 49 who said they heard about the video, 22 percent said they first learned about the video from Internet sources. Of those between 50 and 64, 12 percent first heard about the video through the Internet and of those 65 and older, only five percent first heard about the video through the Internet.
“Kony 2012 is a great case study of generational differences,” said Morley Winograd, a senior fellow at the Center on Communication Leadership and Policy at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism. “The Millennial generation is a group-oriented generation. They share things widely and enjoy doing so.”
The speed and low cost for consumers makes online media popular among Millenials, Winograd said.
Andrea Edoria, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism, said she uses the Internet every day as her primary news source.
“I don’t have a TV so I go on the Internet to get my news,” Edoria said. “Mostly, I’ll look at news networks like CNN, but also Twitter and Facebook.”
Stacy Huang, a sophomore majoring in psychology, said she also gets the majority of her news online.
“It’s easier to access than a newspaper,” Huang said. “Rather than wait for news, it comes right to me.”
Winograd said those who were born in the 50s, 60s and 70s have different values than millenials.
“Generation X and the baby boomer generation were raised very different,” Winograd said. “Generation X was raised with a loose style of parenting, and thus developed a ‘fend for themselves’ mentality, while boomers focused on personal values as they were maturing.”
This means those who were skeptical of the video at first were older. Baby boomers prefer to trust established sources and Generation X does not trust the group movements.
“You have Boomers saying, ‘No, no leave this to the experts already at work,’” Winograd said. “Then you have Generation X at the forefront of the pushback [against Kony 2012] skeptical of group activities and saying, ‘Where is my money going?’”
The Pew poll supports this, as it found two-thirds of the initial Twitter conversation supported the video against Kony. Winograd said the data shows how the Millennial generation, most active on Twitter, was quick to embrace the movement and offered the least skepticism toward it.
Faith Jessie, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism, chose to share the Kony 2012 link after watching the video and conducting her own research.
“I found out, like anyone else, on Facebook,” Jessie said. “The majority, though, shared the Kony 2012 video and went about their day,” Jessie said.
The skepticism of older generations is merited, Winograd said, because social media sacrifices fact-checking and editing in exchange for speech and instant access.
“There is a great danger that people will believe something is true because everyone else is sharing it,” Winograd said. “It creates an environment where conformity is cultivated as opposed to skepticism.”
Though the factuality of some information portrayed in Kony 2012 is hard to discern, the video raises awareness, Jessie said.
“Although [Kony 2012] isn’t 100 percent black and white, it still gave millions of people awareness on an issue they hadn’t heard about,” Jessie said.

Leaders in politics, communication and development from the United States and abroad participated in the Los Angeles Global Cities Initiative Conference to discuss the future of international cities like Los Angeles on Wednesday at the Davidson Conference Center.
During the conference, USC President C. L. Max Nikias emphasized Los Angeles’ current position as an important international center.
Global · Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa spoke about the future of Los Angeles and its role as a global city at a conference on Wednesday. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
“In the 1800s, Los Angeles was nothing but an outpost of the American West,” Nikias said in his opening remarks. “It was valued for its resources rather than cultural bravado. But now, this region is America’s new gateway to the world — physically, culturally and intellectually.”
Nikias said he expects USC and other institutions will be vital for the future prosperity in the region.
“Southern California promises the next gold rush — intellectually and culturally — because of the interplay between our prestigious institutions.”
At the event, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said universities like USC are integral for fueling the economic growth of cities.
“Our business schools can provide necessary market research, export strategies and business plans with local businesses,” he said.
Dick Drobnick, director of USC’s Center for International Business Education and Research, said USC will play a role in contributions to technological and entrepreneurial capital because companies benefit from the international cultural perspective of students and graduates.
“This is especially advantageous for international students’ collaboration with local companies,” Drobnick said.
At the conference, Nikias cited statistical evidence for USC’s recent impact on technology.
“There are currently 44 active business startups based on USC intellectual property which have brought in over $800 million of venture capital in the last decade,” he said.
Alden Mitchell, a sophomore majoring in economics and electrical engineering, said USC’s potential to spur growth stems from students’ enthusiasm. Mitchell is president of USC’s National Organization for Business and Engineering.
“USC has current and motivated students,” Mitchell said. “[NOBE] bridges the gap between Viterbi, Marshall and other disciplines to foster a culture and community of entrepreneurship at USC.”
Paralleling USC’s role in innovation and global awareness with the globalization of Los Angeles’ economy, Nikias closed with remarks about the future of USC and Los Angeles.
“My university is at the forefront of experimentation of ideas, a dynamic blend of arts and humanities. Our students are skilled world students in training,” he said. “We can offer renewal in the face of uncertainty: untold new opportunities for ourselves, our communities and our posterity.”

No. 5 USC men’s swimming and diving team (4-3, 2-3) prepares to compete in the 2012 NCAA Men’s Swimming and Diving Championships at the Weyerhauser Aquatics Center in Federal Way, Wash., Thursday thorugh Saturday.
USC hopes its abundance of talent, including sophomore All-Americans Vladimir Morozov and Dimitri Colupaev, junior Alex Lendrum and senior All-American Jeff Daniels, can help them improve from their fourth-place finish during this year’s Pac-12 championships and a seventh-place finish at last year’s NCAA championship.
Last year’s efforts marked the third-straight season of improvement for the Trojans, with eight different swimmers earning All-American honors.
USC has nine NCAA team titles, the last one coming in 1977, along with 112 individual NCAA event titles (94 individual, 18 relay), both ranking fourth nationally.
USC has at least one NCAA title each year for six of the past 11 seasons, but the last one came in 2007, with Larsen Jensen winning the 1650-yard  freestyle.
Prelims start at 12 p.m. each day, with finals beginning at 7 p.m.

Following an eighth-place finish at the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters Tournament last week, the USC men’s golf team looks for brighter prospects as it competes in the Barona Collegiate Cup on Thursday and Friday.
The tournament, held at Barona Creek Golf Course in Lakeside, Calif., will be hosted by San Diego State University and features 16 teams. Among the squads the Trojans will face are fellow Pac-12 rivals Arizona and Utah.

After a strong opening to the spring season, which featured back-to-back second-place finishes at the Hawaii Big Island Invitational and the San Diego Intercollegiate Classic, the Trojans have struggled to maintain such a start in recent play.
After a loss to Oregon at the Del Walker Match Play in Long Beach, Calif., in late February, the team finished eighth at the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters in Las Vegas.
Senior Steven Lim achieved the best individual result, finishing at 3-over-par 219 and tying for 11th place.
The standing marked the fourth top-13 finish of the season for Lim, who opened the final round with 12-straight pars, then shot a double bogey on the final hole that kept him from the top 10.
Sophomore Jeffrey Kang posted a team-best score of 1-over-par 73 on the final day, recording a 1-over-par on the front nine before coming in even on the back nine. Kang finished 32nd with a final score of 9-over-par 225.
Freshman Anthony Paolucci finished tied for 33rd at 10-over-par 226, sophomore Ramsey Sahyoun tied for 48th at 13-over-par 229, and junior Martin Trainer tied for 56th at 15-over-par 231.
Following the short, two-day tournament, the Trojans will have a week off before participating in the U.S. Intercollegiate Tournament at Stanford Golf Course in Palo Alto, Calif., March 30-April 1, where they will seek their second victory of the season.

USC has been home to national champions in almost every sport. The football team is a consistent winner and one of the most successful programs in the history of the sport. Baseball had its glory days under coach Rod Dedeaux.
There have been multiple Olympians coming from championship track and field teams. The Women of Troy basketball team won two titles consecutively in the 1980s.

The school recently added its newest varsity sport, women’s sand volleyball. Though it is easy to assume the team will be championship caliber right off the bat, it would be a disservice to put that sort of expectation on the Women of Troy.
Those championship teams named above? They weren’t always that great. No matter what the sport, a program takes time to develop.
The football team, which was started in 1888, played only two games in its inaugural campaign. The first year they played a full 10-game schedule was in 1905, and the team went 6-3-1. Solid, but hardly spectacular. In fact, USC football did not experience its first 10-win season until 1921, 33 seasons after the program was founded. The Trojans’ first national title came in 1928. It took 40 years for USC to win its first national championship. Not exactly a quick rise, honestly.
The baseball team, which has won 12 national titles, did not start keeping win-loss records until 1921, in which they finished 8-2. In 1923, the team finished 6-10. The Trojans won their first national title in 1948, a season in which they went 26-4. It took 27 seasons for the team to reach the top of the college baseball world, a surprisingly long time considering the success the Trojans have had since.
The Women of Troy basketball team was established in 1976. Led by Cheryl Miller, it won its first title in 1983 and another in 1984. Despite its quick rise to the top, the team has not won a title since 1984, showing how difficult it can be to not only start a program, but to sustain excellence over the years.
The USC women’s soccer team, which won the national title in 2007, hardly had a great start. In its first season in 1993, the squad went 2-15-2. Though the team is consistently a contender on the national level, it was not always so.
The men’s tennis team was established in 1924 and won its first title in 1946, and has not looked back since. But it took more than two decades to get started.
Perhaps the exceptions to the rule is the women’s water polo team. The team should, however, serve as the exception, not the rule. The women’s water polo team was started in 1995 and captured its first championship four seasons later in 1999.
USC has 114 national championships in men’s and women’s sports and is well on its way to more. The point, however, is not how many they have won, but rather how long it generally takes to win. It does not happen overnight; it often takes decades.
Though it is certainly easier now, given intense recruiting and great facilities on campus to attract prospects, it is unrealistic the women’s sand volleyball team will contend nationally right away.
Yes, this is the inaugural season for the sport around the entire NCAA. Every school, for all intents and purposes, is starting fresh. Somebody has to win the national championship; and that someone will have been playing for just as long as the other teams. Why not USC?
It is certainly possible. USC knows how to win. That cannot be overstated. But given the general process of building a national powerhouse in college sports, it is unreasonable to expect immediate national success and a national championship right off the bat.
Instead, it is realistic to do what all the other programs have done on campus: build and wait.
The best programs here took time to develop. There shouldn’t be any doubt that the program will be incredibly successful in the coming years, just don’t expect a perfect record in 2012.
Good things come to those who wait. Just ask the 114 championship teams that have banners and trophies displayed in Heritage Hall.

Have other schools previously fielded sand volleyball squads (even at the club level)?  If not, isn’t everyone starting at square one?  
I thought this was the inaugural season for NCAA sand volleyball.  USC should be as ready as anyone else to contend nationally (particularly with the participation of players from the elite indoor team).

After a long spring break trip to Hawaii, the Women of Troy get back to their home-pool today in a match against Long Beach State (7-10), the first of three games in a span of four days for USC.
The Women of Troy (12-3, 2-1), however, weren’t basking in the sun in the Aloha State — they were undergoing intense training sessions throughout the week.
Unstoppable · Sophomore goalie Flora Bolonyai has helped No. 3 USC to 12 wins in 15 games. As a freshman last season, she was an All-American honorable mention. - Adrian Hoffmann | Daily Trojan
“It was mostly to focus on what we haven’t been doing too well in games and to get in good shape,” sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist said. “It was a pretty hard training camp, so we’re ready now for the second half of the season.”
No. 3 USC kicks off the last month of the regular season against the 49ers, a team the Women of Troy defeated 11-3 on Feb. 25 in the UCI Invitational.
“It was a close game at the beginning, but then we got it together,” sophomore goalie Flora Bolonyai said. “I don’t think it should be a hard game this time.”
USC is 33-0 all-time against Long Beach State, which is lurking just outside the top-20 rankings.
“We’ve practiced a few things for them,” Gilchrist said. “Hopefully we can perfect those and keep getting better for our bigger games this weekend like [Arizona State] and Loyola.”
USC is tied with No. 4 Arizona State (18-3, 2-1) in second place in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation along with No. 5 California, a team the Sun Devils beat 10-7 in their home-pool.
The Women of Troy don’t think they’ll trip up in Tempe on Saturday like their rivals from Berkeley did.
“[Arizona State] has a good two-meter and a couple of good outside shooters,” Bolonyai said. “But I don’t think we should be afraid of them. If we play our game, we should win.”
Senior attacker Alicia Brightwell leads the Sun Devils and the MPSF in scoring with 2.84 goals per game.
“Hopefully we’ll be able to counter their attacks and come out with the win,” Gilchrist said. “We have to be fully prepared and just play our game.”
After facing off against the Sun Devils, the Women of Troy will fly back home to wrap up the weekend with a home match against Loyola Marymount University   (11-7) on Sunday.
USC is 22-0 all time against the Lions after beating them 8-6 last month at the UCI Invitational. The Lions are on a       four-game winning streak after clinching the LMU Invitational last week.
“[Loyola Marymount] gave us a really close game last time, so we have to be ready for them,” Gilchrist said. “We just need to make sure that we don’t stop playing. We can’t get too comfortable with a lead.”
The Women of Troy clash against Long Beach State at 5 p.m. at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, then play Arizona State on Saturday at noon on the road before returning home for the match against Loyola Marymount on Sunday at 1 p.m.

Over the weekend at the WonderCon 2012 comic book convention, IDW Publishing announced that the series Womanthology — which just put out a Kickstarter-funded 300-page graphic novel — is going to become an ongoing anthology series. The book, and the new series, is made up of stories, essays and comic-making tips from an all-female creative team.
It’s a great book and an exciting project — anthology series are rare these days — but it also comes at the same time of some unsettling controversy about sexism in mainstream comics.

When DC Comics started its New 52 relaunch of its main titles, the creative teams were short on female writers and artists.
Many popular female creators, such as Nicola Scott and Amanda Conner, were working on secret projects such as Earth 2 and Before Watchmen, but the initial announcement was met with questions and criticism.
Then there’s the depiction of women in comics. Some of the initial New 52 characters, such as Catwoman or Starfire, were heavily sexualized without any merit to the plot. This goes hand in hand with ongoing criticism of the appearance of female characters in comics, and it’s a bad mess for the industry.
There is an unfortunate mentality against women in comics. Comics are viewed as a male-centric medium. That is not true; there are a number of female creators as well as a strong female audience.
I’ve seen women eagerly talk about the latest issues of Captain America in comic book stores and enthusiastically buy tickets to WonderCon and Comic-Con. Yet the stereotypical image of the comic scene is a “no girls allowed” club, which hurts the industry and fans. This mentality alienates a large number of potential readers while belittling or dismissing women who already read comics.
Comics are steeped in the tradition of pulp magazines, horror novels, sci-fi B-movies and World War II patriotism. Sometimes they’re flat-out sensational, as in Frank Miller’s Sin City, and other times they are a slice of life, such as Harvey Pekar’s American Splendor.
But in the mainstream, that sensationalism tends to manifest itself in skimpy costumes for superheroines or sexually suggestive situations. Granted, the superhero genre has musclebound men on panel in skintight uniforms, but that never reaches the extent to which women are portrayed. It’s an attempt at titillation and often times is more distracting than appealing.
The sad thing is that this shouldn’t be an issue at all. Yes, there tend to be more men than women reading comics, but women are not a miniscule minority. But whether it’s companies or creators initiating this idea, there is still a strange delusion that it’s a boys’ club and women are an anomaly among readers.
Comics deserve a slap in the face. Women read and create comics and there shouldn’t be some great shock or awe over this. This doesn’t happen in any other medium: no one looks at TV and says that it isn’t a girls’ thing.
That, however, shouldn’t turn women away from comics. Dozens of books out there aren’t sexualized and amazing female creators are working on new books. The prolific and genre-hopping Becky Cloonan is bringing Brian Wood’s Conan series to life, while Fiona Staples just released Saga, her collaboration with Brian K. Vaughan, which looks to be one of the year’s best titles.
And it’s not to say that all guys reading comics are freaked out by women joining in — they aren’t. But this is a medium that has been socially marginalized throughout the last few decades and went through a sensational boom in the 1990s, when things had to be bigger, hotter and more extreme. Like it or not, comic book fans adopted parts of the stereotypical view non-readers have of comics.
Will things radically change? It’s not likely that every superhero costume will become modest — imagine Superman and Wonder Woman running around in baggy coveralls. The idea doesn’t really work, does it? But comics need to stop sexualizing female characters solely to be provocative. It doesn’t add to the story and is more of a distraction.
Titles like Womanthology amaze, both in terms of content and showcasing the multitude of female talent in comics. The new ongoing version of the anthology is going to be great. It’s just a shame that the perception of comics as a male’s medium persists.
But that perception is changing and looks to be near its breaking point.

Bully, directed by Lee Hirsch, examines the situations of kids who are bullied in school. What’s striking about the stories is not that the film’s anecdotes say something new about bullying, but that they enlighten the audience about its poignancy.
The documentary features Alex Libby, a 12-year-old student of East Middle School in Sioux City, Iowa. He’s been bullied since elementary school. His classmates constantly punch him, call him “fish face” and threaten him. His story is not necessarily the most significant, but it is the most representative of the message the film strives to put across: Seemingly harmless taunting isn’t harmless at all.
Victim · Much of Bully revolves around Alex Libby (above), who is constantly bullied by his peers. By illustrating the community’s lack of initative to speak up, the film hints at the subtly crucial difficulties of stopping violence. - Photo courtesy of The Weinstein Company
The film alternates between scenes of different families from various states around the country as they deal with bullying. Hirsch’s skill as a filmmaker is evidenced through the consistent narrative flow despite the film’s scope; each of the families’ problems  form a unified message and story.
One of the most important points of the film is that bullying is not just “kids being kids,” but is a real case of victims and victimizers. The film fails, however, to emphasize that the problem does not only lie in the aggressive behavior of the bullies but on the passivity of the bullied.
Alex is not to blame for the way other children treat him, but he has come to believe that the kind of interaction he has with his schoolmates is appropriate. When his parents approach him, he merely claims that his schoolmates are “messing around.”
Though the movie successfully proves that children — no matter how strong-willed — are often unable to deal with bullying on their own, it does not show how anyone else can really help. In fact, it is extraordinarily effective — perhaps in spite of itself — in simply portraying people’s frustrated attempts at making a difference.
An example is when Libby’s parents talk to the school’s vice principal. They tell her that Alex is being bullied intensely on the school bus. The vice principal’s reply: “I’ve been on that bus. They are just as good as gold.”
The audience knows, from the footage it has seen, that this is far from the truth. And viewers can’t help but boil with anger and frustration at their powerlessness. How do school administrators intervene without becoming overly intrusive? How does a child stand up for a bullied schoolmate without facing abuse himself? How does a parent help his bullied child if schools and police departments are unresponsive? The film isn’t a guideline to dealing with the problem, but a heart-wrenching expression of the problem itself.
Bully’s admirable attempt to make its audience empathize with the victims of bullying is aided by skillful cinematography, which is important. An ordinary school day, if beautifully rendered, can make viewers pay closer attention to the film as a whole — and in this case, what happens during that school day.
Hirsch was able to get footage of bullying in action because he made the clever choice to shoot with a Canon 5d Mark II, which to children would “look like a still photographic camera.” He also spent the whole school year shooting so that children would become used to it. It’s a strategy that works for the credibility of the film and even makes the audience wonder whether the bullies’ behavior was worse when the camera wasn’t present.
The film’s music is also well done; the score flows forward nonchalantly but sparkles with intermittently touching moments.
Bully is a reminder of the power of film. The film’s real strength is that it, if only temporarily, motivates viewers to get involved. Those who see the film might have already known about bullying, but sometimes people need to be reminded of why they should care.

USC should rethink its unrealistic parking rules. 
Have you ever gotten a parking ticket at USC? Or better yet, received more parking tickets from USC than from the Los Angeles Police Department? The USC parking enforcement regulations should be revised according to state law.
When the parking enforcement at a college campus is stricter than that of the government, we have an issue. Permit holders already pay a lot of money for their spots. To actively seek out more money from permit holders through parking fines is simply an abuse of power.
USC is very keen on making the rules vague and difficult to access.
For example, take the carpool spaces in the lots all over campus: Much of the first and second floors of the parking structures have red signs for carpool parking only. Why is this confusing? Because the sign is directly in front of one spot, yet has arrows pointing in both directions. Does this mean that we cannot park to the right or left of that spot? And if it does, how do we know how many spots down the line this even applies to? Apparently all of the spots in between signs, although unmarked, warrant citations.
On the USC Transportation website’s Parking Rules & Regulations page, the illegal parking section says that parking “in more than one space is not permitted regardless of duration.” What this rule does not state is that having a tire partially over the second yellow line — even just one centimeter — counts as parking in more than one spot and constitutes an expensive ticket.
The parking committee does not abide by California DMV laws that allow free meter parking on holidays. Rather, they charge at the meters 24/7 with no exceptions.
Furthermore, students who live on campus and have parking spots in the lot do not visit their cars daily. The fact that citations can be given repeatedly for the same offense when the driver has failed to see the first citation is absolutely ridiculous.
Overall, the parking enforcement system at USC is a ploy to make money off of its drivers. The parking committee seeks out payments whenever it can.
The USC administration should revise the parking regulations to make them fair and reasonable, rather than use them to take advantage of drivers.
Nicole Sneider
Junior, communication
I have a slightly different experience regarding being cited for parking violations. The two times I appealed the citations, I won. 
No action was taken and no fines levied.
Absolutely agree with the article. You nailed it on the head. I’ve considered running the citation officer over when I see them in structures.
As a permit holder, I am beyond frustrated. I’ve recieved a ticket for my tire being on the line, even though the spaces are so narrow that I had to pull in at an angle so the adjacent car doors can have room to open. I received a ticket for my permit being on the right side of my windshield instead of the left and and another for parking in PSx instead of Radisson when my designated lot was full. All of this is in one semester. I feel that the parking rules are ridiculous and a ploy to rip students off.
Why should a private university be bound by state laws regarding parking? That’s a retarded point to make.

What does the typical vegan look like? You might imagine a hemp-clad hippie or a willowy celebutante. In recent years, however, the vegan movement has gained some unusual participants, such as metal legend Ozzy Osbourne and former boxer Mike Tyson. There’s also a subset of body builders, the subject of a Jan. 4 article in The New York Times.
That’s not to say that veganism is anywhere near mainstream; even vegetarians often have a hard time ordering food at restaurants. Still, many activists are trying to make plant-based diets the default. In their mission to stop animal cruelty and environmental damage, organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and Last Chance for Animals promote strict veganism.

Giving up meat, eggs and dairy for a cause is noble. If you can do it, that’s great. Unfortunately, veganism is unrealistic for much of the population.
Animals rights and environmental organizations should recognize that many Americans lack the time, money and access to information on becoming vegan. If activists’ main goal is to reduce the overall consumption of animal products, they should encourage people to simply alter their diets — not subject them to a total renovation.
The media is full of vegan celebrities raving about the diet’s health results. Eight months after becoming a vegan, Tyson told Details magazine, “I get these explosions of energy. I don’t know how long they last, but they’re like explosions. So powerful.”
Plenty of students could use the occasional explosion of energy. But while a vegan diet is certainly healthier than the typical American meat-sweet diet — a diet based on red meat and refined grains — it’s not always the healthiest option. Vegans only reap the benefits if they get the diet right.
In a 2008 USA Today article, Keri Gans, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association, explained that many vegans switch right to vegetables and soymilk and wind up sick. A proper vegan diet consists of “a bountiful variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds and a few fortified products.”
The sad reality is that it’s usually costlier to get that healthy variety than to buy meat, bread and a few vegetables. The latter option might not be ideal, but it gets the job done at a lower cost.
The article goes on to mention that fortified food and supplement vitamins often aren’t available in conventional stores. It advises people outside of cities to order them online.
But not everyone can afford the additional cost of shipping, let alone the products themselves. And not everyone can afford to spend extra money on groceries in the first place.
There is also the issue of time. A vegan diet requires research. In an ideal world, we’d all be spending plenty of time educating ourselves about nutrition. But what if you’re taking five classes and writing a senior thesis? What if you’re a working mother with two children? Not everyone’s obligations and priorities make room for veganism. Good or bad, that’s the reality.
Personal experience has taught me that even if you buy the right products and do your homework, it’s still possible to fail. I spent a semester going nearly vegan — I ate eggs only one day a week. I researched obsessively, and as far as I know, I followed the rules. But it wasn’t meant to be: I got sick by the end of the semester. I didn’t recover until I succumbed to chicken nugget Tuesday.
Organizations that demand veganism from everyone — without regard for class, income and lifestyle — risk putting off people who might otherwise be happy to give up meat for a day or two.
From the outside, becoming vegan seems sort of like joining a secret club with a pledge process. You go through weeks of cravings and emerge with the glow of health and moral superiority. It’s no wonder so many people are reluctant to join.
But giving up animal products for one meal a day or one day a week is far less daunting.
When the entry fee is low, more people are likely to join. Isn’t it better to convince hundreds of people to adopt Meatless Mondays than to convince a handful of people to give up all animal products for life? Perhaps this approach is less ideologically pure, but when you’re looking out for animals’ well-being, numbers count.
The approach might even lure a few unexpected people into the full-on vegan lifestyle.

A animal has life. There is no difference between a animal and a human. I’ve been vegan for over 3 years and food is much more exiting. I love broccoli and spinach. There first thing I notice about veganism is that I have emotional stability and I am at peace with my self. Torture and death that animals go through cannot be described by these words. Murder is murder. Bottom line. The whole world will go vegan soon. The change to rights for all instead of just human rights. Peace out
WOW…when it comes down to having to research HOW to eat and it taking TIME to do it makes you wonder about society when we can use our RIDICULOUS cell phones like they are an appendage but cannot read a book about nutrition to become vegan??? First of all, we become instantly healthier, second–proof that it is healthy–yes just look at the athletes, and yes we are aiming to stop cruelty and save the environment. What do you mean EVERYONE cannot become vegans? FATALIST!!!!! This is sorely untrue. This article is ridiculous. It is CHEAPER to eat meat??? Have you seen the cookbook “Eat Vegan on $4 a Day” by Ellen Jaffe Jones???? Not only do I own a copy, I use the recipes frequently and it is proof that we eat cheaper than meat eaters!!! I feel sorry for the author of this article……………
I agree. The article attempts to use laziness as a valid excuse for not educating oneself about proper nutrition. That’s insane.
I’m curious why there is no link to the 2008 statement from the American Dietetic Association? Especially considering that their July 2009 stance is thus: “It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes”  Furthermore, there is an ever growing number of nutritional studies showing the advantages of a plant based diet. This has to factor in to one of the concerns raised about “cost”. Pay now with better food or pay later with bad health.
That leads me to discredit that notion that a plant based diet is expensive. My family is on a very small fixed income – We manage just fine with bulk foods such as beans, legumes, rice and fresh vegetables that are not all that expensive at all!  The processed vegan foods can be costly – But they are not a requirement to eating well. Whole foods are what will deliver the most quality nutrition at the lowest cost.
It’s also a misconception that vegans require many supplements. Honestly, I took more supplements while eating as an omnivore. Go to any GNC or “health food” store – most people buying vitamins are meat eaters.  If you eat well – meaning a wide variety of plants – You should have no need for any “supplements” save b12 which is not expensive and available everywhere.
I’m very certain that your failed health was not restored by eating nuggets. I suggest you research yet a bit more about the benefits and ease of a plant based diet: http://nutritionfacts.org/  Whatever your health issues were it’s highly doubtful that “nuggets” will be the cure.
But, at the end of the day, your family is left eating “beans, legumes, rice, and fresh vegetables.” I eat all those things in moderation in addition to animal flesh. I would say that I have a lot more variety and choice than you do.
Perhaps you do, but I would argue that leaving the meat out leaves far more room for a variety nutrient dense foods, fiber, and phytonutrients, etc. I don’t eat animal flesh because there’s no reason to as there are healthier foods to consume…
And if I were concerned only with health, I would consider examining your argument. However, I eat meat because it is pleasureful and I am a hedonistic being.
I would argue that superior health is directly related to “pleasure.”
And that is entirely within your rights. However, as I mentioned in my first comment, I value the pleasure that I derive from eating meat at roughly fifteen years of life.
Wow. You’re saying you’d give up 15 years of life to enjoy the taste of cooked corpse? To each his own, eh?
“Barely cooked” would be more accurate. :D
I  think it can be easy to go meatless or vegan. When you make a meal with meat, you usually have side dishes. So just leave out the meat! Simple. If you are used to casseroles with meat, just make it without the meat. Basically, start eating a variety of fruits, veg’s, breads, rice, pasta, salads, nuts. I personally still eat dairy and egg whites. I actually think it is cheaper too. Cans or frozen fruits and veg’s are cheap. If u can’t buy organic, just rinse items well. Beans are very satisfying too. I do this because I do not feel I have to kill an animal just to eat. God or the creator put all this in the earth’s soil for us and water. I believe every living creature has a right to a good long life. We should not take that away from them.
Okay, John’s ridiculous comments aside, back to the article.  I disagree that eating vegan is necessarily more expensive.  Good quality meat is very costly, if you want meat that is not full of antibiotics and hormones you will pay a premium for it.  A bag of dry beans, a bag of brown rice, and a bunch of vegetables don’t cost much by comparison, and the beans and rice will make many more meals than a one cut of the aforementioned meat.  Even if you don’t care about the antibiotics and hormones, meat is still more expensive than rice and beans. 
I do agree though that those who are just trying to improve their health can take a slower more moderate approach though, replacing a few meals at a time with vegan alternatives, using meat more sparingly by spreading it out in stir-fry dishes, replacing milk with a non-dairy alternative such as flax milk, almond milk, or hemp milk… taking just a few steps at a time will go a long way to improve health, without overwhelming the person.  Also, the knowledge that one doesn’t have to commit to “NEVER EVER having cheese (or meat, or ice cream… fill in the blank) again” leaves a person free to enjoy food, knowing that if they truly want whatever that non-vegan favorite is they can have it without guilt, just not that often. Of course I say this as one who chooses to eat “mostly vegan” for health reasons only, if I believed it was ethically wrong to use animals for food I probably would never want to make an exception.
I also agree that one should do a little research before attempting to go completely vegan.  Some vegans may not like this statement but there ARE some nutrients that are more difficult to obtain on a vegan diet, but if one is aware what they are and how to get them, one can be mindful and select those vegan foods that ARE good sources of those nutrients.  (For example, eating nutritional yeast, the only reliable vegan source of B12, or consuming foods fortified with B12).  Taking a gradual approach allows time for a person to learn these things while still obtaining the nutrients from the animal foods that still remain in their diets.
All that said, diet is a personal choice, and no one should force their preferred choice on another adult, ever.  Whether that is a vegan attempting to forcefully “convert” an omni, or an omni arguing with a vegan relentlessly as John has been doing.
LOL!  John is just playing with us. I bet he is a vegan and an active member of PETA!  Don’t play his game.
I hate peta and am not a vegan.
Vegans only try and convert people to veganism because they are cry babies about us eating meat. I have never met such an emotional bunch of idiots. The meat is here for us to eat. Thats all the animals are good for!
You can’t be serious.
I am 100% serious. I prefer meat in my freezer then the animals being alive walking around. They are no use to me alive.
Flawed logic. If no animals were alive, then you’d have nothing in your freezer. I would also suggest that you take an intro to ecology course…
I agree with breeding them and holding them captive to produce meat. I just mean that’s the only thing they are good for. My freezer is packed with their delicious relatives :)
The only thing they are good for? You obviously have more of a warped anthropocentric worldview than a fundamantal understanding of ecology. I also assume that you are grossly ignorant of the adverse economic and environmental externalities associated with the industries you support. Try opening your eyes a little, my simple-minded friend.
Many animal rights groups don’t promote only veganism, and they do recommend that people gradually reduce their animal product consumption because many people, before they try it, find the idea of eliminating animal products to be overwhelming. Before they try it. The reality is, once people go vegan, they quickly realize how easy it is and that their apprehension to try veganism was unfounded. Yes, its best to do some research. Information about vegan nutrition and animal rights is abundant on the internet, and all people have to do is redirect a fraction of the time they spend surfing the web towards learning about the suffering they contribute to with every meal. Or towards learning about how animal products destroy their health. 
Most vegans describe their dietary choices as, at most, inconvenient. Sure, you’re often limited to 2 items on the menu, or you have to create your own dish. But at home you can make anything. All of your favorite foods can be veganized, and more vegan substitutes appear in the grocery store everyday. The minor inconveniences that vegans endure are nothing compared to the lifetime of suffering that the animals endure. The minor inconveniences that vegans endure are nothing compared to years of chemotherapy, quadruple bypass surgery, heart attacks, strokes, auto-immune diseases, and the long list of ailments and life-threatening conditions people endure from eating animal products. The minor inconveniences that vegans endure are nothing compared to the animals that suffer habitat loss from deforestation to produce grazing land and grow grain to feed to livestock. Being vegan is really easy and has such far-reaching benefits. 
In terms of promoting reduction of animal products vs. elimination, both strategies have merit. For some people its too much to consider eliminating all animal products. But if we think about it from the animals’ perspective the picture is quite different. If it were our own species that was enslaved, mutilated without painkillers, confined, raped, had their newborns stolen, and murdered, would it be acceptable to suggest that people reduce their contribution towards these atrocities to 6 days per week instead of 7? If it were humans, would we promote less rape and murder because its easier to achieve than NO rape and murder? I doubt it. Besides, lets not underestimate people. We are perfectly capable of making dramatic changes when called for by basic rationality and logic.
Animal rights organizations could just mind their own business and not study what others eat.  I didn’t ask for any recommendations from them. I am not interested in lowering my consumption nor will I ever be. I am not concerned about animal rights or suffering. They are my food not my family or friends.  I support my food being fed so habitat loss is not my concern either. I will buy and support whatever I wish with my money. Peta and all other animal activists groups or even single animal activist people can bit my ass. What I do is my business and I will not change living how I like.
*Bite My Ass*
Haha. Why are you so reactionary and defensive? Calm down. “Animal rights groups shouldn’t study what others eat?” Why the hell not? Studying this is imperative to gain a knowledgable foothold on nutrition, food distribution, efficiency, and ethics. Perhaps you just deliberately choose to be ignorant.
Hey Guys, John has major issues and one is that he needs a lot of attention.  Let’s ignore him. He is totally ignorant, uneducated and illiterate. One positive note is that he has made me stronger in my vegan convictions and it is obvious that you are all passionate about your healthy, happy plant strong lifestyles.  Life is good.
I have been vegan for many years now and am in the best health of my life! No winter colds, no feeling tired after meals, and I eat a much more nutritious and balanced diet!  I’m a full time college and working student with very little time or money and that has no effect on me being able to afford nutritious vegan food.  Nutrition information is just a click away and so many cities hold annual Veg Fests and other events that offer information on making the switch.
I get the author’s stance on promoting a gradual transition into vegetarianism and veganism which some people need be it mentally or otherwise but I definitely made the switch “cold tofurkey” without any problems and again like I mentioned, taking 5 college classes, working 40 hours a week, maintaining a relationship, running a student organization, and more. So… again, if you were to go up to an activist and say “I don’t know if I can be vegan but I’d love to try vegetarianism 1 day a week” or something like this, they are not going to flip out on you!! I hear omnivores complain about vegans being preachy more than I’ve ever heard a vegan being preachy—and here, we see an omnivore being preachy! hahaha. The irony.
Anywho, veganism rocks. Oh, and PETA was at my campus recently promoting Meatless Mondays–not full-on veganism although they themselves were vegan. Case closed.
And in regards to the person who mentioned canine teeth, herbivores such as hippos and horses have canine teeth so that argument just has no hold.  
Also regarding taste, if the Internet weren’t so creepy I’d invite you to dinner because I make the most amazing food. We just had a MeatOut event at my school (national event promoting a plant-based diet) that served nothing but 100% vegan food to many omnivores who were pleasantly surprised.  I actually also own the book mentioned above “Eat Vegan on $4 a Day” by Ellen Jaffe Jones and you haven’t lived until you’ve tried the sweet potato muffins!
I could go on forever but these are my main thoughts.
I am amazed at the animosity between vegans and omnivores. It’s a choice people. No one is trying to brain wash anyone. I don’t have much money or time, but veganism works beautifully for me. I went to my local library and checked out The China Study. That led me to check out Forks Over Knives and the Engine 2 Diet. Easy peasy. No money, lots of info and it was easy to take in. The collaborators for those books and movies are some of the foremost experts in their fields. The 2 biggest experts were raised on farms, so grew up eating the Western diet. Check it out. And I seriously doubt anyone can get sick eating a vegan diet. And chicken nuggets??? Really??? They aren’t even in a food group!
Its vegan propaganda but whatever floats your boat. The research in them are biased and false tho.
Prove it
One journal article, one. You won’t even show us WHY it’s propaganda, or what the conflict of interest is that makes it biased.  Find one unbiased journal article proving that we are destined for an early grave and we’ll start taking you seriously.
It only makes sense for animal rights groups to push veganism. If they didn’t, they would kind of be hypocrites. A vegan diet can be expensive if all you’re buying is mock meats/cheeses, etc. There is nothing cheaper than rice, beans, fruits, and vegetables no matter where you are. 
A lot of beginners go through a detox phase. Its your body getting rid of all the toxins that its been consuming for so long. So thats why some people say that they get “sick”. But once your body is cleansed, you will feel so much better.
No one is demanding that veganism be done overnight, however it can be done.  Take the steps that feel right to you. Start out with vegan breakfasts, and then a week later turn your lunch vegan…and so on…
Veganism is very attainable. Just be sure to have a well balanced diet with lots of variety.
Veganism is not a healthy way of life. Its not a detox period, its your body adapting to a lifestyle not meant for it. There is no nasty toxins to get rid of so its not detox. Your body will never feel better, its not healthy to be vegan. Veganism is not for everyone nor will any dumb organization demand me eat as I don’t want to.
No organization is ‘demanding’ you to alter your purchasing habits, troll. Veganism is healthy if done properly. Just ask Brendan Brazier (triathlete) and some UFC Fighters among others…
You are the trolls. This is an article stating its not healthy nor is veganism for everyone. Oh you mean ask the people whom love steroids.
The article is an op-ed piece with no supporting information. Many of the comments here are earnest critiques of said article. You’re just here to troll, regurgiate your simple-minded views, and generally make yourself look foolish.
A. Provide sources for your claims, otherwise your argument is invalid and you are a troll, just as others have said. 
B. No one is forcing you to do anything. 
C. It’s becoming increasingly evident that you are a closed minded bigot who wishes to cling to ignorance and attack anything that threatens to make you look at the damage you cause to this planet and its inhabitants. 
Go ahead, reply, prove me right.
Not every organization demands people to immediately switch to a strict vegan diet.  Any vegan will tell you that Meat Free Mondays or a similar choice is far better than nothing.  We try to always support people and show people why, how, and how great being vegan can be.  They may make the decision today, tomorrow, or sometime far into the future, but we try to plant that seed for whenever it does happen.
It is sometimes difficult to be vegan; this is true.  But that’s part of why we need more people to do it.  The more people adhere to a vegan or vegetarian diet, the more demand for it goes up, and the more available it becomes.  This is our goal.  You can’t change one thing without changing another, and we’re working towards more than one goal here.
However, I strongly disagree with a couple of your points.  Getting a balanced vegan diet is NOT more expensive than the meat-sweet alternative.  I can buy enough vegetables to make a huge dishthat will last me at least 2 days for less than $8.  Being vegan is easy and incredibly affordable if you know what and how to cook.  If you don’t have time to cook, you’re still spending far more than the price of veggies on fast food.  This doesn’t even include the health costs.  In two years plus I’ve been vegan, I’ve had two colds, both of which were cured merely by loading up on oranges and veggies.  Period.  Before I became vegan, I was at the doctor every other month for some illness or flu, always having to pay for medications and doctor’s appointments.  A dollar extra per meal is definitely worth it when looking at hundreds of dollars in medical bills, plus the lost wages and time while you were sick.
Second, I highly doubt that “chicken nugget Tuesday” cured your vegan sickness.
John, are you enjoying pink slime?  Me thinks thou dost protest too much…perhaps you have a deeper issue to resolve. Vegans are kinder and gentler people. You should really give it a try. Amen brother.
There’s no pink slime, that is a myth. Vegan myth trying to make meat sound nasty. I have no issue to resolve and no vegans aren’t kinder people. They are mentally inbalanced. No I will not try that unhealthy lifestyle.
You don’t think pink slime actually exists? Wow. Okay, you lost all credibility on this forum.
WOW a vegan said I lost credibility when he doesn’t know sh-t about meat processing except what he heard from vegan propaganda. Go eat a carrot and leave the real men to eat what is meant to be eaten.
Haha. You say you don’t believe in mechanically separated meat and now you’re using ad hominem attacks because you have ZERO rational arguments on your behalf. Pathetic. You’re just a troll and not a very intelligent one.
I am speaking the truth Mrs. Frank. I have friends whom work for meat processing. There is no pink slime.
Please continue commenting John, you are further discrediting yourself with every word you type.
Really Vicki? Discrediting my word in every type? ROFL You vegans are the biggest idiots in the world. You think you know everything about nutrition and how meat is processed but alas you don’t know anything. You guys are just upset because I eat your precious animals and then lie to make it look like veganism is some magical life when if fact it sucks big time. I am not into eating just plants. They are sides to me. I eat them because I have to, to keep balance in my diet. Meat is far tastier.
John, the more you respond, the more foolish you look. Don’t you get it yet? Try formulating a coherent argument with supporting info for once instead of your childish ad hominem attacks and perhaps people might take you seriously for once.
All I have been doing is stating facts but the lack of meat to your brain makes it hard for you idiots to understand. Its ok I know veganism is a mental illness as well as an eating disorder.
John, you’re right.  Keep eating meat. In fact only eat meat. We don’t need you anymore.
no thanks Rob I will continue eating a balanced diet with meat and plants. The diet designed for humans. Eating one or the other is not the suitable diet for us.
You need to let us process all the journal articles, non biased and maturely delivered facts you have presented to us. Check back in a week, we’ll all be eating like you.
Yeah, Frank, John’s statements and even his poor grammar shout out his ignorance–pure waste of time to attempt communication with such.  “Against ignorance the gods themselves contend in vain.”  (Friedrich von Schiller)
John is clearly uneducated.  I am not a vegan myself, but I do limit animal products, and probably eat more “vegan” meals than non vegan meals.  I have nothing against omnivores and agree that being vegan may not be right for every person on the planet,  for example, I have a friend who cannot tolerate most beans and legumes, cannot tolerate wheat gluten, and is allergic to most nuts and seeds, she has numerous other food allergies as well.  A vegan diet for her would be a diet terribly low in protein.  
The reason I say John is uneducated is both because he so quickly dismisses any health benefit of a vegan diet despite the fact that eat this way has shown itself to be beneficial on many levels for many people.  The next reason is he doesn’t realize that “inbalanced” is not a word.  His own education was so UNBALANCED that it failed to cover basic English.
correction:  “despite the fact that *to* eat this way…”
Oh really? You seem very uneducated but that’s ok. There are plenty of health benefits in the way I eat as well. I do eat plenty of plant based foods with my meat. I do not just eat meat. Its called balanced diet which is the healthiest. But you guys believe what you want but I will always have meat with my meals. The only animals I love are my meat main dishes.
The us department of agriculture confirms it exists.  But they’re vegan propagandists I assume.
John is the token anti-vegan reactionary for this thread. Funny. He’s basically a parody that no one here really takes all that seriously. People like him make me even MORE glad to be vegan.
We have to stop letting it bother us.  He went off on a tyraid at first about how dumb and chemically imbalanced we all are and that we have an eating disorder.   My diet was very clean and I got lots of excersize when I was eating meat and dairy.  I went vegan and I feel better than I have since I was 12.  I don’t need an Internet bully to show me the effects of eating meat and dairy.  my original goal of going vegan was for a cleanse, but Ive felt so good for so long I’ll never go back.  No study, journal article or know-it-all is going to change that.
Maya: First of all, when you stated you got ill from being vegan and that “I didn’t recover until I succumbed to chicken nugget Tuesday,” you revealed a lot of information. Chicken nuggets? Out of all meat products out there you praise chicken nuggets as your savior? Have you ever looked how they are made? How many antibiotics and growth hormones are in chicken meat? What it sounds like, from a nutritional point of view, is that you were going through withdrawal symptoms. It usually takes at least a month to get all the crap from eating meat, and animal-derived products out of your system. During that time you don’t feel too good. But then… recovering alcoholics don’t feel too good either when they go through withdrawal, neither do individuals who give up smoking.
Second, going vegan is easy. And it doesn’t require a lot of research at all. Make sure you get a variety of veggies and fruit, and don’t forget lentils, beans, and nuts. There are plenty of starter books out there by now, if you want a book to guide you through this process.
Third, I am fighting for the life of sentient, intelligent souls who feel fear, pain, joy and pleasure just as much as we do. Why would I not promote this lifestyle? It is good for the animals, it is good for people, it is good for the planet. Win Win. Easy. Period.
Watch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKr4HZ7ukSE
Animals are hardly sentient and certainly not intelligent. I do not feel bad shooting them, cooking them, or eating them. I will always enjoy consuming them.
This article is a joke on several levels. It seems that the writer is overly-defensive about the vegan diet/lifestyle and seems genuinely alarmed about the activists that promote it. I’d also like to know which specific groups are ‘demanding’ people to become vegan. Also, it suggests that it’s too much work and research to become vegan. That’s a rather weak argument and it apologizes for laziness. First of all, everyone has a responsibility to educate themselves on proper nutrition in order to be healthy and not passively succumb to the standard American diet (if they want to truly enjoy good health). Perhaps that’s why vegans are often less deficient on nutrients than the general national population because they have educated themselves. And onto the costs: ordering vegetarian or vegan at a restaurant is often significantly less expensive than the standard meat-centered options. The only reason why meat and the standard American diet is ‘less expensive’ in some contexts is because we subsidize the hell out of it with our taxes and the true costs and externalities are not reflected in the price of the products. And lastly, you’re avoiding the medical costs often associated with eating animal products over many years of one’s life. This article is heavy on excuses and weak on content and supporting information.
Actually vegans are more deficient in nutrients and vitamins. Also most places do not cater to your unhealthy vegan diet unless you want a salad. I support them subsidizing meat.  There no medical issues associated with meat or animal products I am very healthy. Always have been.
John, provide some supporting info to support your claims or I’ll just view them as invalid. Glad you’re healthy, as am I (without meat and dairy of course). There are no medical issues associated with animal products? Really? Haha, please explain that one. That could be entertaining.
Its been proven for centuries there isn’t.

Prove it. So far, you’ve contributed nothing, my simple-minded friend. Just the same reactionary, child-like reactions…
Not sure about people lacking the “time and money” notion… A healthy vegan diet can be easy, enjoyable, and inexpensive. You know what’s none of those? Coronary bypass surgery. I go to school full-time and work-time, so I’m short on both money and time, and veganism works great for me. Easily the best decision I ever made. It’s a great feeling: knowing that ever day I am doing something positive for my health, for animals, and for the environment.
Coronoary bypass surgery is not from eating meat. Mainly from too much fried food or if you eat red meat constantly. Limit red meat to twice a week and leaner meats the other days. I have been to school and have taken several courses on nutrition.
Coronary
Screw the animal rights organizations. They can’t demand me to do crap,hell not even my government can demand me of anything. I will eat and purchase anything I want. Meat and animal products will always be in my home.
John, no one is forcing you to do anything, not even to forcefully change your mindset of being willfully ignorant. You say not even the government can demand you to do things yet in a post above you say you support the subsidization of meat. The government makes you pay taxes right? Try using logic for once. It works wonders…
I support my taxes going to subsidizing meat.
Aw, doing what the government tells you (such a good little bitch); you sound far more obedient than your previous post!
Because I support the meat industry.
Your lack of wit and education displayed by your responses is simply astounding.
The meat industry has played a major role in supporting this country throughout its history. I happily support it over many other industries, including everything related to saving animals or the environment.
Same here anonymous
Stop with defeatist attitude.  I went vegan on labor day, with barbecues hot dogs, and hamburgers all around me.  I was a typical meat-head “bodybuilder” who swore meat was a necessity.  I always hear people tried to go vegan but they got “sick” until they eat meat but they never specify A. What they were/weren’t eating or B. what “sickness” they had.  I currently have a cold, should I go buy a rotisserie chicken like I did last summer?  I know vegans who eat Oreo cookies all day, they’re obviosly not healthy and will get “sick” until they eat a “chicken” nugget.   The only thing I agree with is that there is a lack of information for new and curious vegans the rest of your article is just perpetuating nonsense.  Just because you had a bad experience the rest of the world will so don’t even try.  Animal rights groups should disband because YOU (the authority) on veganism has proven it doesn’t work.
My diet isnt the best but I’m learning.  I would never consider eating meat or dairy ever again.   
I’d rather spend more money on my food than spend money on medical bills.  Nutrition and diet are two things that even the busiest parent should make time for especially with obesity related ailments only effecting people at younger and younger ages. 
People on a budget can almost not afford to NOT go vegan.  The amount of empty calories and lack of nutritional value make a typical meat and dairy diet almost a false economy and don’t provide the proper nutrients for someone to sustain a healthy, sickness free lifestyle.  Penny wise pound foolish isn’t a mantra I want to associate with my health. I think most people can agree.
I never get sick as well and I eat meat and dairy. I never get a cold nor have expensive medical bills due to my lifestyle. I take 0 medications and I don’t get as much as a sniffle in the winter time. I have never been overweight, Overweight isn’t from meat anyways its from over-eating. Actually buying meat is inexpensive and a person on a budget can definately afford a balanced diet, not just a vegan diet.
Are there healthy meat eaters? Probably. This isn’t my argument, never was. This article, along with yourself are both trying to convince people (myself at least) who ARE healthier than they were when they had a BALANCED diet consisting of meat and dairy that being vegan is going to kill them.  Just because your health is awesome doesn’t mean there aren’t people out there who are struggling to eat meat and dairy in “healthy” portions. It has worked so well for so many people that your arguments are just irritating and dead-ended.  The ADA agrees that a well planned VEGAN diet is healthy for anyone.  If you’re healthy, great, I’m not talking to you. I’m trying to refute the argument that vegans can’t be healthy which is more or less the message of this crappy article.  You, nor this article have given any resources besides name calling and typical defensive stubborn meat eater b.s. for us peruse and be proven wrong.   I am a healthy Vegan, far healthier than when I ate well balanced diet with 5-7 hours of vigorous workouts a week.  In fact the increases to my well being were marginally better than when i quit smoking 2 years before quitting meat and dairy.  Good for you on being healthy, but my mood, stamina, sex-life, cholesterol, allergies and skin have all improved so i must being doing something right.
What Ellen said ^^^.   You said that the information isn’t out there for people to become educated and make the right choices, but it IS….now more than ever.  It’s a lifestyle change and takes education and research just like anything else a person approaches with which they aren’t familiar.  When it comes to college kids, I agree, it’s tough because the cafeteria foods in most places (at least where my daughter goes) doesn’t offer much beyond proteinless pasta dishes and a salad bar for vegan choices, so it may be more expensive for them to eat elsewhere.  Pressuring “society” into veganism is the only way to turn the tables of eating and buying animal products cheaper/easier because of demand and supply.
Its not anyones job to pressure someone into veganism. Its our choice and none of your business what we eat. Its cheap to eat meat and plants. Not costly for me at all to do so. I have no desire to turn tables from eating meat and animal products. Its a food choice, such as veganism is your choice.
Maya, what exactly was the magical ingredient you believe was in that chicken nugget that you believe you can’t survive without? Specifically.
Veganism ios not a healthy diet. I have known many whom tried it and got very ill. Its recommended a balanced diet with meat included for all your nutrients. Trust me you do not want to Go Vegan unless you want a trip to the emergency room.
Vegan is a healthy diet if done properly, as the vast majority of medical/scientific info suggests. Keep in mind that any diet can deficent it it’s unbalanced. John, you’re clueless…
So weird. I went vegan and haven’t seen an emergency room.  Even weirder is that most other vegans know havent been there either.
It is unfortunate that this article promotes so many myths and misunderstandings of veganism.  It is also unfortunate that you have such a narrow view of veganism.  Although you say, “Giving up meat, eggs and dairy for a cause is noble”, you have failed to consider that not everyone is a vegan for a “cause”.  I became vegan so that I could improve my health and spend less money on food.  The meat, dairy and processed foods I was buying were far more expensive than the food I now eat.  I am a busy single parent but I learned as I went.  We started out with Meatless Mondays and proceeded to vegetarianism and now to veganism.  We live in a small town where fancy vegan products are not accessible.  That’s fine because most of them are processed anyway and I don’t need to eat things like that.  In this day and age, anyone with a computer has all the information they need about being vegan at the click of a mouse.  If trying to live a healthier lifestyle on a budget also means that I am aiding in the cause of animal cruelty, then great!  From a scientific and economic standpoint, if the majority of North Americans were vegan, we would be able to grow enough food for ourselves and many other countries!  Animal products are an inefficient source of energy when you factor in the amount of energy required to get the food to your plate.
Meat dairy and eggs are cheap where I live. Doesn’t cause much at all. Regardless of the energy and such for meat to get to my plate, I will always eat meat and animal products. The environment will be fine and I will live happy. I am not concerned with animal cruelty, they are just products to me and delicious also its not a healthier lifestyle. You can be just as healthy if not more healthy eating a balanced diet with meat and plants. I am not concerned with growing food for other countries. Let them deal with their problems. I have food and so does my family so I am good with that. We aren’t starving anywhere around where I live. Even the homeless people get food from food banks and kitchens. I am all for America and thats all.
Basically, you’re saying that you’re a selfish moron with such a narrow worldview that you wish to not educate yourself and would rather be a misinformed internet bully (clap clap).
Really?  Veganism isn’t hard, or costly. I turned vegan in 1 day. Yep, 1 day. I did my research on the fly between looking after my parents and working a 45hour week. I’ve never been ill because of veganism. I’ve saved money, lost weight, gained energy. Once you learn what you can and can’t eat it’s easy! You are opened up to a world of tasty food and great community. I love my new life and diet and done properly, it’s suitable for everyone. And I’ll shout about it till the day I die, because people need to know.
Peace.
I understand how daunting the idea of going vegan can be but it isn’t about us. It’s about the animals first & foremost. Once you know, once you really know that animals should have the right to live their lives free of abuse & pain & torture & that animals are not ours to enslave then slaughter & eat then going vegan is the only answer. 
The author tried to go vegan for a semester but got sick. It is disappoiting when someone who has tried & failed then writes about how hard it is as if to justify their failure.
Being vegan is not moral superirity. It is about compassion, it is about kindness & it is about the animals.
Its about me. I am not concerned with the animals, they are my food.
You’re obviously not concerned about your intelligence either. It shows…
Because I believe in my right to eat meat I lack intelligence? Tell that to the billions of people whom feel the same as me? We are the majority Frank. We will always be the majority, people love meat, just face it. We subsidize it and market it by the tons :). Thats not even mentioning the local farmers and butcher shops.  America will atleast be forever meat eaters. The only place that might slack is India.
Wrong. I know some intelligent meat eaters who actually use some degree of reason to substantiate their opinions. I disagree with them, but unlike you, at least they can can discuss this on rational grounds instead of ad hominem fallacies. If billions of people “think like you do” then the world is in trouble. Majority versus minority is irrelevant to the discussion in the first place. Most people in this country claim to be Christians. Does that motivate me to join their ranks. No, it’s herd mentality and it has no bearing on this topic…
I do not care about animals. I like ripping their flesh apart. It makes me feel good. I enjoy shooting them, cooking them, and eating them.
I consider myself to be exceptionally compassionate.
I’ve been vegan for 3 years (vegetarian for many years before that), and I remember thinking it was going to be difficult, but it wasn’t at all. And it’s almost never difficult to find something at a restaurant. And it’s not difficult to get nutrition from a vegan lifestyle at all! I eat like absolute crap sometimes, but I got my physical results back last week, and all of my vitamin levels are normal, perfect cholesterol, perfect BP. Any healthy diet is about moderation, and researching how to eat vegan is so easy! The Internet abounds with vegans who want nothing more than to provide you with hundreds of delicious recipes, restaurant and product reviews, and nutrition tips. I should know, I’m one of them. When non-vegans find out I’m vegan, they almost always ask “what do you eat?” There’s a vast misconception that vegans eat nothing but twigs and granola, kale and tofu. So about a month ago, I launched a blog called What This Vegan Eats — I’m photographing and blogging everything I eat for a year so people can see what it’s really like (and how easy and awesome it is) to eat ethically. If you’re interested, you can check it out at whatthisveganeats.com. Maya, we’d love to have you back on team vegan, I’m happy to personally answer any questions you have if you’d like to give it another try!
“Animal rights groups shouldn’t push veganism”
Why not!!! Meat eating monsters bombard us with Propoganda in many forms on a continuous basis whether it be billboard, TV advertising or by some other form or forum. Brainwashing is why there are so many conditioned meat eaters and so few Vegans. Fortunately some humans are born not just to follow and these people reject what they were wrongly taught about animals being units, and opt for a lifestyle which projects far less cruelty on those unable to defend themselves.
Being vegan is easy,arguing with those clinging to fallacious notions and plane nonsense that somebody told their impressionable young brain to accept without question is what is hard.
Oh no! I’m a monster because I eat meat. What “plane” nonsense I must constantly spew.
You people just don’t get it. I would put in extra effort to eat meat because I enjoy ripping apart the almost-raw dead flesh of animals.
Wow. First off, to the poster about the canine teeth, you should do some research before you bother typing anything. Lots of herbivores have seriously big canines, here is a nice chart for you to check out: http://michaelbluejay.com/veg/natural.html
Secondly, I easily went vegan, it’s not hard and “vegan food” is just regular, natural food that you should be eating anyway! What did I do? I switched from dairy milk/cheese/yogurt to non-dairy versions and I stopped buying meat/seafood. What do I eat? Much more delicious food than I did before! Before it would be a piece of meat, a vegetable, and a starch made up a meal. Now I can get creative and have excellent, wholesome foods. Last night I had a Blue Mango burger (made from six ingredients: onions, black beans, spinach, rice, panko breadcrumbs and spices, that was easily better than any beef burger I’ve ever had. Salads, fruits, so many different and delicious soups (LOVE my crock pot!) and none of it ever makes me feel ill and bloated. My skin has cleared up since I stopped drinking dairy. 
Anyway, long story short, I love that I’m not killing innocent animals for no reason (we DO NOT NEED meat in our diets, as vegetarians and vegans who live years longer than carnivores have proven), and I get to feel healthier and eat more of a variety of foods.
My canine teeth happen to be exceptionally long and more curved than usual. Perhaps I’m simply more evolved than others.
I’m sorry that you feel bloated and ill from eating normal food. That has never happened to me. I also have perfectly clear skin. Yesterday, I had a hamburger made from beef that I ground myself. It was easily better than any “Blue Mango” burger that you pulled out of a box from your freezer. My mother got a crock pot when we were kids. She used it once and raved about it. My father and I took it outside and beat it with aluminum baseball bats and then threw it away. We don’t have one anymore.
Long story short, I do not feel bad about killing animals, which I do not consider to be “innocent” because they lack consciousness and the capability to made decisions. I also do not care whether I give up years of my life (which I do not expect to) from eating meat.
Yes you should be eating plants along with meat for balance. Non-dairy versions do not taste good. Meat is the most delicious part of my meals it cannot be replaced with plant based. Last night I had home-made beef hamburgers mixed with onion soup mix. That was delicious! No veggie burger is better then beef. I have tried a couple just to see what they taste like and I wanted to barf. I never feel ill or bloated with my meals either. My skin has always been clear and I consume dairy daily. There is a reason for the animals being killed in my house and its to supply me meat and there’s nothing wrong with it. Also vegetarians nor vegans live longer and its not proven. Some vegan doctors lying is not proof.  I am very healthy and feel excellent. Every vegan I have ever seen have problems and take suppliments or are very pale and lack of energy.
Where to begin? Oh yeah that has been said.  Eating vegan is a choice and unfortunately we are not taught proper nutrition in school.  Like any other change someone would make in their life they need to investigate it; when they do they will realize this is a simple healthy way to eat.  It need not be complicated.  I believe in the KISS system.  I have read Ellen Jaffe Jones book and it is a great place to start.  I also recommend Lindsay Nixon’s Happy Herbivore cookbooks.  I am a lousy cook and even I can do this.  I chose this diet for health reasons but after watching Earthlings I was appalled and how our meat comes to market.  Eat More Kale!
Yes we are taught proper nutrition in school.  Veganism is in no way a healthy way to eat.  Eat more meat! Earthlings was a sorry film. WOW they find one bad slaughter house and say they are all like that and all the staged animal entertainment footage. It was all staged to make it look bad.
Being taught the Four Food Groups (which was in effect industry-funded propaganda) in elementary school doesn’t qualify as being taught proper nutrition in school. A majorty of the medical community disagrees with you John, and so do I.
Why are schools teaching nutrition, anyway? Shouldn’t that be left to parents? Oh, no, that wouldn’t work—your agenda wouldn’t get forcefully pushed into homes if that happened.
I agree with you anonymous. Vegans have no clue about real nutrition.
“The sad reality is that it’s usually costlier to get that healthy variety than to buy meat, bread and a few vegetables. The latter option might not be ideal, but it gets the job done at a lower cost.”
This is very much NOT the case in my experience, and I’m bummed to see you propagating this misconception. I spend less money being vegan than I did as an omnivore. Also the only reason meat and dairy is relatively inexpensive is government subsidies. The true cost of veganism is MUCH cheaper than eating animal products.
I agree with the commenter that said you should have researched more, and interviewed some vegans, before writing this article.
“But not everyone can afford the additional cost of shipping, let alone the products themselves. And not everyone can afford to spend extra money on groceries in the first place.”
Lentils and rice are very affordable. Many of us vegans do not purchase faux animal products and have no difficulty staying on our limited budgets. In fact, one might even save a good bit of money at the market, as well as savings on medication and health care. All people need to eat healthy diets to have a healthy life; but with veganism, one gains the extra benefit of supporting non-violence, improving environmental health, and helping to feed the hungry. For ethical vegans, as I am, the main reason has nothing to do with what is easy or what is cheaper, but what is the right thing to do. Causing unnecessary suffering does not make for a peaceful life.
As an animal rights activist, I do pay attention to what Ms. Itah says about reducing consumption of things which require death and suffering to animals. We advocate for veganism, but understand that people take varying degrees of time to achieve a total plant-based diet. 
Anyone with a computer has all the resources in the world to become vegan. There are hundreds of wonderful sites and podcasts dedicated to vegan recipes, vegan products, and vegan living. All it really takes is the initiative to want to live a cruelty-free life.
Wow! I just want to balance things out by saying that (1) veganism can be a little time consuming, I will give you that, but, I am a mother of three that has managed to do enough research to stay healthy and provide nutritious meals for my family. (2) Vegetables and legumes are much cheaper than meat. My grocery bill is much smaller every week than it was when I was buying meat for all of our meals. And (3), at anonymous, I’m not sure where you have eaten your vegan meals, but the ones I have had in restaurants and the ones I produce at home have as much if not more flavor than the meat meals I use to make. My family and I were all carnivores before I decided to go vegan, and we all love the food we eat now! Oh, and I’m not sure how you came up with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes being ”unnatural”. Last time I checked they are all grown in NATURE.
At the end of the day, food made without animal flesh can never have the same texture, flavor, and other qualities that I enjoy when eating meat. Vegan food itself is not unnatural; however, the process of confining oneself to eating nothing but vegetables is.
Clearly you don’t know enough because we don’t eat only vegetables.
Meat eaters and vegans alike should both be eating vegetables, seeds, and nuts as part of a healthy diet.  Eating vegan would not be a huge “switch” if a meat eater was already eating healthy; rather, the diet excludes certain foods, then you add a vitamin (B12).
Or we can keep eating meat and vegetables and make no switch at all.
And leave out taking vitamin supplements, which are certainly the hallmark of an effective, natural vegan diet.
totally misinformed yet again.
Some might not take suppliments and are healthy on just plant based diet. But I have seen alot talk about taking a suppliment for this and that. Its cool if you don’t tho Rob, glad you are healthy as well.
You state that research is necessary to become a Vegan or Vegetarian —I agree. 
I also think you need to research more before you publish. Maybe interview a Vegan or two while you are at it. The fact is…being Vegan isn’t that hard and doesn’t require as much time as you think it might.
People should focus on saving animals if that’s what they want to do. I would rather give up fifteen years of my life than stop eating meat and other animal byproducts. Vegan food is disgusting, unstimulating, and unnatural. Humans have canine teeth for a reason; use them or at least shut up and let others do so in peace.
I agree.
Give up 15 years of your life then.  But keep in mind the last 5-6 won’t be very pleasant either. Forget the people who would care that you’re dead, anyone who relys on you, they aren’t important.  Your tastebuds, they’re in charge.   Eating plants is unnatural, weird. “put an apple and a bunny in a crib with a baby if he eats the bunny and plays with the apple I’ll eat my hat”   If you want to talk about the makeup of humans and what were equipped to eat, compare our canines to EVERY other meat eating animal (my teeth don’t look like my dogs).  Then, compare our digestive systems with meat eaters and vegetarian animals.  We’re far better equipped to handle plants than we are to tear through flesh.   We’re also the ONLY species who drinks milk after infancy AND the ONLY species who drinks the milk of another species.  I’m not a cow, I’m not an infant. That’s unnatural, go ask any other species that isn’t suffering from cancer, heart disease, diabetes and soaring obesity.
Until you know facts quit spouting out crap. Its not unhealthy to eat meat despite what you guys have been brainwashed to believe. Meat nor animal products causes none of those diseases. Go to college yourself and ya may learn something Rob.
John: I am a university professor and a VEGAN!! There is plenty of scientific research that shows that vegans are much healthier than meat eaters. There is not a single scientific article that shows otherwise. May I suggest that you educate yourself before spouting this utter nonsense?
Its false and biased research. No truth in it. There are plenty that say otherwise. Try google. I have educated myself.
I have 3 degrees including a PhD and yes, I’m a vegan. Your comment is invalid.
Wow. You must be so smart. You’ve spent your life living off other people’s money and not producing anything worthwhile for the world.
Are you retarded John?
Countless studies by credible universities and unbiased sources seem to disagree with you but who are we to argue with the one person obviously trolling this topic.  Studies aside, I personally went vegan and have yet to make a single trip to a doctor, hospital or mourge. In fact quite the contrary I feel better than I have in years.  Stop telling all these vegans, that have first hand experience they don’t feel better.  Troll.
I would love to see your canine teeth. Looking at my cats and dogs and then comparing my set of teeth to theirs kind of makes me laugh about your statement. If your canines work so well, why not give up on the use of silverware?
Also, as I have stated before, I am fighting for the life of sentient, intelligent beings. I will never shut up about it. But maybe you should, considering that you have forgotten civility in your discourse.
They may be sentient but they are not intelligent. They are not sentient when I cook them :). I make sure they are dead!
Why do gorillas have canine teeth?
Who cares. I am not a gorilla I am an omnivore human.
“… many Americans lack the time, money and access to information on becoming vegan.”  
First of all, being vegan is cheap.  If it’s not, you’re doing it wrong. The only expensive vegan foods are processed things that should be only a tiny part of your diet. 
The information is everywhere.  There is only a small percentage of people who don’t have access to the internet or the library at this point. 
As for time, that’s just rubbish.  EVERYONE should be taking more time to make (and learning to make) better nutritional choices.  You must — vegan or not.  If you only eat what you are fed by the mass media, advertising and subsidies, you will be a big fat idiot who is ill and on medication between age 40 and death.
And remember — a corpse doesn’t balance your diet. Those animal corpses aren’t cheap.  You are deluded if you think that.  
And dairy is from another species and is intended for a suckling calf.  Are you a suckling calf?  Do you hope to grow into a heifer?  I didn’t think so.  Get your calcium the same way the cows do — FROM PLANTS.  
Be a healthy vegan — go to the Produce Department and “eat the rainbow”.  Eating fruits & vegetables in a range of colours is a good start.  Buy some nuts, seeds & beans.  See?  Not that complicated.  
You can learn about tofu, Daiya cheese, nutritional yeast, etc, later as things move along.
Wow, I don’t know where to start with this, other than to shamelessly promote my book, “Eat Vegan on $4 Dollars a Day.” As a single working mom, all I wanted to do was get healthy meals on the table in a hurry for my 3 daughters. 
As an Emmy-winning TV investigative reporter and then Smith Barney financial consultant trying to dodge genes that gave mom, aunt and both sisters breast cancer plus most other preventable diseases, I got so tired seeing stories with 300 pound women loading carts with Twinkies saying “You can’t eat well on a budget.” I place in 5K races for my age group, I ran my first marathon last year. I was the fifth oldest woman to finish the Palm Beaches Marathon. I’m an AFAA certified personal trainer, RRCA certified running coach and volunteer high school cross country coach.
I’ve been eating this way most of the past 30 years. I didn’t get all the good genes. What’s inconvenient and expensive is watching relatives deal with a lifetime of heart disease, cancer and diabetes. What’s time consuming is getting your chest cracked open from heart disease, taking insulin every day and chemo. Research shows that a simple, cheap vegan diet as outlined in my book can reverse many diseases ala Bill Clinton and many more. 
Dodging family genes has been the investigative reporting job of my life. I sell nothing. I simply want my 3 girls to grow up in a world avoiding the pain and suffering I’ve seen. 
Please do the balanced reporting and research. When you understand there’s no money in broccoli and that most docs don’t take a single nutrition class in med school, then you understand why you have to be your own investigative reporter. 
My book is my publishers #1 seller and I speak all over about how much you can save at the store and by avoiding hospitals. Reviews have said every college student ought to use my book.
Its a shame you push your horrible vegan agenda on your kids. They don’t even get a say so. Veganism is a horrible unhealthy lifestyle. Yoyr should be ashamed abusing your children like that.
It’s a shame how misinformed you are.
It is you whom is misinformed Rob.
John, you’re either misinformed, or a troll, or both. GTFO
“JohnCommented Today at 4:11 PM (22 minutes ago) |
Marie we don’t get that from meat, Also we breed more meat eaters and trust me my kids wont be vegan or vegetarian.”
WOW did you learn to copy and paste on your own?? Good Job!! You are smarter then most vegans.
I would submit that the author of this article is thinking too small.
First, a move from a country that is mostly omnivores to one that is mostly vegan wouldn’t happen overnight.  As more and more people give up meat and animal products, grocery stores would start carrying more and more products that don’t use animal products; that will drive the price down as competition grows.  
Second, as more people switch their diets, the amount of information about it will grow and penetrate deeper into society.
This author’s argument against veganism is one that I hear often; it goes something like this:
“If everybody went vegan, we would be over run with cows, pigs and chickens.”
A very cursory look at this argument shows the flaws.  It’s self evident that it’s not an on and off switch.  As people convert their diets, meat and animals product manufacturers will lose their market and they will stop breeding cows pigs and chickens.
Thank god that won’t happen. Us meat eaters will always be the majority. It will be a cold day in hell before I become vegetarian or vegan.
It’s funny, I said that a few times before I went vegan.  People act like act like they like meat more than the next guy like its some kind of contest, makes me laugh.
I mean what I say. I will never give up meat.
you may be the majority for now… but what about after you all die of cancer or heart disease (or one of the hundreds of other illnesses that have been proven to be worsened by eating animal products) by 50 and vegans are living to be over 100?
Marie we don’t get that from meat, Also we breed more meat eaters and trust me my kids wont be vegan or vegetarian.

The Temper Trap has been in Los Angeles for the past two months recording its second album, The Temper Trap.
The self-titled album will have 12 new songs, first released in Australia and New Zealand on May 18. The U.S. will be able to purchase it on June 5.
The El Rey Theatre welcomed The Temper Trap and opening act PAPA to its stage this week on March 19 and 20.
PAPA had a decent set. It is not traditional to see a drummer play the part of a lead singer, but that was something special the band had going for them.
The Temper Trap, on the other hand, showcased a brilliant performance.
Surprisingly, the band played a great number of new songs, including its encore song, “Rabbit Hole,” which was recently released on Youtube.
The band also performed “Need Your Love,” which will be the first single off of the new album.
Generally at shows, a crowd looks forward to hearing more familiar songs from previous work, but it was still an enjoyable sneak peek of what the band has been working on this past year.
The Temper Trap weaved in several crowd favorites, including “Drum Song” and “Sweet Disposition,” which received a lot of cheering and high-pitched whistling.
Each member of the band does a great job of standing out in some way. For Dougy Mandagi, the lead vocalists, it’s how effortlessly he reaches high notes. For bassist Johnathon Aherne, it’s the way he grooves around as if his bass is an extension of himself.
The band has welcomed guitarist and keyboardist Joseph Greer as a permanent member. At the El Rey, he really put in an effort when playing the tambourine, instead of just standing there hitting it in a boring fashion.
The Temper Trap disappeared for a moment after gaining so much exposure from being featured in  the movie 500 Days of Summer and touring a lot, but the band seems to be continuing to stay out of the shadows.

Woody Allen’s upcoming film, which was once titled The Bop Decameron and was later changed to Nero Fiddled because the director feared the title would be too obscure for audiences, has received another title change.
The prolific director has now changed the title of his film to the much more conventional To Rome with Love.
This isn’t the first time the director has run into problems with titles. In fact, his Best Picture winner, Annie Hall, originally had a title of Anhedonia, which means “the inability to feel pleasure,” but was changed at the request of its studio, United Artists.
Woody Allen is coming off his most successful film to date with Midnight in Paris and a title such as To Rome with Love will likely attract more viewers when it is released on June 22.
The prolific director, who is known for filming in his hometown of New York, has chosen Europe as his destination for his past few films. This film follows in the tradition of his most recent films, such as Midnight in Paris and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, by including the city’s name in the title, further attesting that his European films are love letters to the cities they were filmed in.
In a press release, Sony Pictures Classics, who will be releasing the film, explained the title change.
“‘To Rome with Love was a name selected as an homage to the eternal city of Rome where the film was shot on location last summer. This will be used for its worldwide release. The film’s former title, Nero Fiddled, while an appropriate and humorous phrase in the U.S., is not a familiar expression overseas and many international territories preferred a more globally understood name.”
To Rome with Love is said to be divided into four separate vignettes, including American and Italian actors.
