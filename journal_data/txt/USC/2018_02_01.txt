On Wednesday evening,  the newest edition of Music@RushHour — a weekly concert series presented by USC Thornton School of Music — presented their classical guitar showcase to an intimate crowd of students, faculty and others at the Ramo Recital Hall.

The program was launched five years ago, and hosts events each week with  different themes. Previous events have included a classical string series and a jazz ensemble as well as more contemporary themes such as a cello and piano duet that featured LGBTQ composers. 
The musicians include a variety of Thornton graduate students as well as some talented undergraduates. Jaxon Williams, a doctoral student studying classical guitar, has directed and organized the event since Fall 2017. 
“It’s a good way for students to connect and relax during the madness of rush hour,” Williams said. “Oftentime in the school of music, students are separated by the kind of instrument they play and this gives them an opportunity to come together and meet other people.”
The first artist of the night was Josh Moore, a doctoral student studying classical guitar. He performed “A Fancy, P.6” by J. Dowland, “Prelúdio de Atenas” by A. G. Abril and “Capricho de Goya No.2 ‘Tal Para Cual’” by M. Castelnuovo-Tedesco. “Capricho de Goya No.2 ‘Tal Para Cual’” is a part of a series by Castelnuovo-Tedesco that is inspired by 24 pieces of art by Capricho de Goya. “Preludio de Atenas,” which translates to “Prelude to Athens,” is part of a trio of songs dedicated to different cities. 
Saro Babikian, a junior majoring in classical guitar and the second artist of the evening, performed “Tres Apuntes” by L. Brouwer, “Sonata K. 239” by D. Scarlatti and “El Ultimo Recuerdo” by  R. Dyens. “El Ultimo Recuerdo” incorporated the tremolo technique that gives the illusion of sustained sound. The tremolo accompanied the melody the entire time, giving the piece another dimension. 
Aaron Haas, a doctoral student studying classical guitar, was the final performer. He performed three of the four movements of “Sonata Romantica” by M. M. Ponce. 
“Ponce was a master imitator and was able to generate writing styles of different composers, but all of his pieces have a distinct Ponce element,” Haas said. “His work was very much his own despite his imitation.”
“Sonata Romantica” was inspired by Franz Schubert’s piano sonatas. Much like said sonatas, the first part, “Allegro non troppo,” was a classic three structured movement, the second part, “Adante,” was slower, while the third was an animated and faster dance movement. 
The theme of next Wednesday’s performance will be Super Piano Brothers, headlined by Wesley Chu, a doctoral candidate in musical arts who is the recipient of the USC International Artist Fellow. 
Chu is also the founder of a YouTube channel of the same name where he and collaborators compose and transcribe music from a wide variety of media, including video games. Next week’s performance will feature video game music for two pianos. 
“I want to make this about more than Thornton,” Williams said. “There’s people in every school that love video games. It’s a cool way for people to come in and blend all interests together.”
Music@RushHour occurs on select Wednesdays from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Ramo Recital Hall. The event is free and open to all.

Students at the USC School of Architecture were treated to a special Wednesday night screening of Ronit Bezalel’s 2014 film 70 Acres in Chicago, a documentary exploring the demolition of Cabrini-Green, a massive public housing complex in Chicago. The film opens with a clip of 15-year-old Raymond “Shaq” McDonald, and follows his journey through the years until he eventually launches his own dog-training business in high school. McDonald professes his love for Cabrini early on, along with many other residents; although the property was worse than dilapidated by the time of demolition due to years of neglect, the strong sense of community made the industrial walls feel like a home.
From left to right: Mark Pratt, Deidre Brewster, and Raymond McDonald were among many Cabrini-Green residents who protested demolition, but policymakers still opted to tear it down. Photo courtesy of Cristina Rutter.
Their sentiments weren’t enough to keep the housing complex above ground, however, as 1995 brought the beginning of the end for Cabrini. Situated in a prime location on the Near North Side, the value of the land drew too much attention from other parties, who decided to pursue more profitable alternatives. In addition, as the local economy sagged and residents struggled to pay the rent, Chicago Housing Authority didn’t have the money to make necessary repairs and instead resorted to boarding up vacated rooms, trying to remain as cheap as possible. Fierce protests ensued as Cabrini residents voiced their displeasure at being left out of the decision-making process, but their demands for the property to be renovated were ignored.
The aftermath was an equally ugly process, as many residents had few alternative housing options and even less time to figure it out. The place they used to call home was converted into a “mixed-income living community,” designed to integrate market-rate housing and affordable public housing into the same space. In an effort to appease former Cabrini residents, policymakers provided them with priority registration when it came time to apply for housing; however, strict, invasive requirements prohibited many from returning. In addition to yearly drug tests, Cabrini residents who wished to live in the mixed-income complex were subject to housing inspections, and anyone with a record of criminal history in their family would not be granted a spot.
Only a handful of Cabrini residents were able to return, with many dispersing to Chicago’s West and South Sides. Those who managed to secure residence found that their community was no longer the same; newcomers in the market-rate category were often suspicious of gatherings of public housing residents, and expected them to change their way of life to adapt to the new surroundings. When the idea of mixed-income housing was initially proposed, the belief was that living among middle-class families would inspire the former Cabrini residents to “improve” their own circumstances; however, resentment and misunderstanding often ruled instead.
But what is the role of the architect in similar instances of gentrification, and how can builders help prevent these situations from reoccurring in the future? The question was on the minds of many in the audience following the screening, and was raised in the Q&A session that concluded the event. Director Bezalel noted how the structural design of Cabrini-Green was less than appealing, promoting a cold, bleak atmosphere rather than that of a warm home. Professor Edward Dimendberg, who hosted the Q&A, also said the materials used and the high-rise formation were not the most sustainable, which only became more relevant as upkeep of the property became increasingly sporadic.
Above all, however, consensus arose in the room that designing for the sake of a good design wasn’t enough, especially when working on buildings intended for public housing. Keeping the needs of an individual community at the forefront of the blueprint is imperative, as well as using durable resources that will still be sufficient years after initial construction. Issues of gentrification are multi-faceted and not easily solved, but as architects begin to see their role in the equation and what they can do to help, the solution will hopefully grow clearer, and future sagas such as that of Cabrini-Green will grow less common.

When I was growing up, I enjoyed going with my parents to the local Hindu temple at their behest. I didn’t understand what religion was or what it meant to be a part of a particular religion. I understood Hinduism to be a collection of related stories — a fascinating, supernatural series like Magic Tree House or The Boxcar Children.
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Hinduism is a broad, diverse religion with no central doctrine. It features numerous spiritual texts, varied belief systems and hundreds of denominations centered around different gods.
My family wasn’t part of a specific denomination, but the main way we practiced the religion was through the Ramayana, a spiritual epic. It featured the story of Rama, a human incarnation of the god Vishnu, who must save his wife, Sita, from the 10-headed demon Ravana with the help of his brother Lakshmana.
My favorite character was Hanuman — a human-monkey demigod who helps Rama along the way. There are many stories about Hanuman throughout the Ramayana, but the one that always stuck with me was the tale of how he saved Lakshmana from a battle wound. A medic said he needed a specifc herb from a Himalayan mountain, and Hanuman — because of his extroardinary ability to leap all the way to said mountain — was tasked with bringing them the herb. When he arrives at the mountain, Hanuman can’t figure out which herb is the right one. So, with his godlike strength, he decides to bring the entire mountain back so the medic can pick out the right herb.
It was stories like these that made Hinduism fun for me as a child. It was Diwali, the major Indian holiday I associated with partying and gifts, that celebrated (in the tradition of Diwali that my family practiced) Rama’s safe return to his kingdom with his wife Sita. It was my family comparing me to Kumbhkaran when I would sleep in on Saturday mornings, because (along with my name being a part of his) Kumbhkaran was an enormous demon popular in the Ramayana because of a part of the story in which he went to sleep for six months before waking up.
From my point of view, the Ramayana wasn’t any different from the stories of Junie B. Jones or Encyclopedia Brown. In fact, the stories were even more engaging than the books I read, because my whole family was part of the experience, and we got to celebrate the characters’ birthdays and major events from the story.
When I got older and began to realize that what Hinduism meant to my parents and most of the people around me who practiced it was a belief in the existence of supernatural gods like Hanuman or demons like Kumbhkaran, I grew incredulous, and became less enthusiastic about going to the temple every week.
On top of that, I was growing up with an education and in a culture where my perception of religion in general was a negative one, associated with wars and violent conflicts, defined by governments who used their power to impose their religion on others.
So I became disillusioned with the idea of religion entirely. I would protest going to the temple, and refuse to participate in prayers or pay attention to the readings from the Ramayana.
My parents never tried to force religion on me heavily, which I appreciate now. Once I became less interested, they took me to the temple less often, until our visits eventually stopped.
For most of high school, I considered myself atheist and thought of religion as a negative institution in human culture.
That was until I discovered Harry Potter and the Sacred Text. I’ve been a devoted, obsessive fan of the Harry Potter series since I began reading it at the age of seven — so discovering a podcast that was based around meaningful conversations about Harry Potter trumped any qualms I had with it also being a podcast about spirituality and faith.
And the insightful, instructive commentary that co-hosts Vanessa Zoltan and Casper ter Kuile bring to each chapter of the Harry Potter series through themes like “forgiveness” and “vulnerability” were everything I didn’t realize I needed.
But they did it through spiritual practice — something I told myself I didn’t want to be associated with. They introduced methods used to read the Bible or the Torah like “sacred imagination,” where you read a passage from a text while imagining yourself in the passage, whether as an observer or as a major character, and thinking through the moral values and lessons you can take away from the experience, even if it’s a mundane paragraph in the text that appears unimportant.
I loved the meaning and moral value that the hosts found deep in the lines of a series I had adored for years, and applying the lessons found in the series to conversations about how we can live our lives day to day. The podcast quickly became something I looked forward to every week.
And the more I listened to it, the more I realized how similar what Kuile and Zoltan were doing with Harry Potter was to what my childhood spiritual practices did with the Ramayana. We were talking about fictional stories, and taking lessons and moral values from them to practice in our daily lives.
Until faith and belief in gods became a part of my understanding of it, I loved religion. Harry Potter and the Sacred Text never asks its listeners to believe that Hogwarts is real or that Harry is a divine being.
Because of Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, religion is no longer something I see as negative or harmful. Religion doesn’t have to be about believing in a god or following the rules of an established institutional religion.
Instead, I define religion for myself as any practice that you do regularly to establish and perform your morals and values — whether that’s through an established church or through reading a text like Harry Potter with intention.
Now, religion is something I aspire to. I haven’t quite found my personal sacred text yet (don’t worry, Harry Potter is definitely still in the running), but I hope to find something I can use to guide my moral compass sometime soon. And who knows? That sacred text might even end up becoming a podcast.

After a rough Week 3 of the first stage of the Overwatch League, the Los Angeles Gladiators defeated the Florida Mayhem by a score of 3-1. Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
The USC Esports club ventured to the Blizzard Arena in Burbank to enjoy a Wednesday night Overwatch League match between the Florida Mayhem and the hometown Los Angeles Gladiators.
Consisting of 12 teams hailing from six U.S. states and three foreign countries, the Overwatch League is the first major global esports league with city-based teams. Los Angeles is home to two teams: the Gladiators and the Valiant. Announced in 2016, the league has finally seen its inaugural season in 2018. 
The Overwatch League season spans from December through mid-August and operates on a stage basis. Over the course of the season, the 12 teams will participate in four stages consisting of 40 matches to record an overall record. In each stage, the teams record a stage record which determines the six teams that will compete in the stage playoffs for a $100,000 prize. The overall record, on the other hand, determines which teams will continue into the postseason. The championship playoffs, which will take place in July, will consist of six teams — three from each conference — who will compete for a $1 million prize.
The Gladiators dominated the match, clinching the victory by winning the first three of four maps. However, the shield was bested by the Mayhem in the fourth and final map of the match. The win improved their record to 3-4. Following a rough, winless week three of stage one, the Gladiators’ win was much needed. 
“I think it’s good for confidence,” Gladiators support player Benjamin “BigGoose” Isohanni said. “Even though the last two matches, we played well on the first one, but on the second one we had some communication issues so we aimed to fix those in today’s match.”
Following the match, the Gladiators traveled across Burbank to the Guildhall esports bar for a meet and greet with local collegiate esports programs. Organizations from USC, UCLA and UC Irvine were in attendance to take pictures, get autographs and chat with players and coaches. 
“It puts regular college students in touch with professional Overwatch,” Quiana Dang, the sponsorships manager of the USC Esports club and a freshman majoring in interactive media and games. “You don’t usually get a chance to actually meet the players … Here, you can actually converse with the players and have discussions about what it’s like to be a player. It’s a better chance to get players closer to the hopefuls in college.”
The booming professional gaming market has led universities to begin considering implementing esports teams into their athletic programs to serve as a method of entry for young players into the professional scene.
“For a college basketball player, [the college level] is a natural step,” Gladiators flex player Aaron “Bischu” Kim said. “I feel like [collegiate esports] are coming there, but people aren’t taking it as seriously. I definitely think there’s potential.”
In May 2016, the Pac-12 declared its plans to organize an esports league within the conference. Due to disagreements among schools and opposition from the presidents of Stanford and Colorado, the Pac-12 was not able to move forward with its objective.
Upset with the decision, 11 student leaders from schools in the Pac-12 founded the Pacific Alliance of Collegiate Gamers. The PACG includes teams from every Pac-12 school except the University of Washington. The organization plans to host esports events in a number of titles among the schools in the organization. 
The season will commence in the middle of February and conclude with a conference championship in April. The league will operate on a round-robin system for league play leading up to the playoffs. Similar to the OWL, the members of the PACG are optimistic for the future growth of their organization.
“Most of the esports leagues are not well organized enough,” said Eric Yu, captain of the USC PACG Hearthstone team and a sophomore majoring in computer science games. “That’s what [PACG] wants to try to implement.” 
Only time will determine the legitimacy of competitive gaming, but for now, the Overwatch League and the Pacific Alliance of Collegiate Gamers are taking huge steps forward in the esports world.

On Saturday, the Trojans will venture to Westwood for a fight against perennial rival UCLA. The Bruins (15-7, 6-4) stand in fourth place in the Pac-12, two games behind the second-place Trojans (17-6, 8-2) and three behind conference leader Arizona.
Coming in at 6’3” and 220 pounds, freshman shooting guard Jordan Usher is a force on the USC Trojans’ squad. Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
Like the Trojans, the Bruins faced a slew of bad press in the offseason. The team notoriously garnered the attention of national media after President Donald Trump intervened to coordinate the release of three freshmen who were arrested in China after shoplifting from three stores, including a Louis Vuitton store. One of those freshmen, forward LiAngelo Ball, has since left the team to play in Lithuania. The other two, forwards Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, remain at UCLA, but are suspended for the season.
After losing guard Lonzo Ball and TJ Leaf to the NBA Draft last spring, UCLA looked forward to its influx of frosh talent. Even without LiAngelo Ball, Riley and Hill, the Bruins still feature two of the best freshmen in the Pac-12. Kris Wilkes, a 6’8” guard, is second on the team in scoring (13.8 points per game) and rebounds (5.4 per game), and freshman guard Jaylen Hands, an athletic 6’3” guard, is fourth on the team in scoring (11.2 points per game) and assists (3.1 per game).
Now adding to the lineup sophomore guard Prince Ali, junior guard Aaron Holiday and senior center Thomas Welsh, UCLA has one of the most menacing offenses in the Pac-12. All five starters average nearly 10 points per game. Welsh, second in the conference in rebounding, averages a double-double. Holiday, who averages 19 points per game and 5.3 assists per game, ranks in the top five of the conference in each of those categories.
As a team, UCLA averages 83 points per game. They rank in the top half of the conference in every major offensive and defensive category. In other words, Saturday’s game will be USC’s toughest test thus far in conference play. 
Moreover, UCLA will have home court advantage. The Pauley Pavilion, one of college basketball’s most iconic venues, is always a hostile environment for visitors, and it is even worse for the Trojans.
Before USC games, UCLA fans of all ages flock to Pauley hours before tip-off to heckle the Trojans as they walk from the bus to the court.
“I don’t remember one pleasant time ever going to Pauley,” senior guard Elijah Stewart said “You pull up and there’s a big line of blue just waiting at your bus.”
A lot is at stake for both teams as they jockey for postseason positioning. Plus, the conference title is still at stake. Each team will face Arizona once this month. 
For UCLA, it will be sweet to earn a game in the standings against their crosstown rivals, but for USC, this game could be a statement. 
Although the Trojans have won six games in a row, their longest conference win-streak since 1992, all of those wins have come versus middle-of-the-road teams. A victory over Stanford, with whom USC split the season series 1-1, is USC’s best conference win. However, that isn’t saying much as the Cardinal stands in fifth place with a 5-4 record.
Winning at Pauley would boost the Trojans’ confidence and establish them as legitimate Pac-12 contenders before they embark on next week’s challenging road trip to Arizona.

Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
After a long wait, we’ve made it to America’s biggest weekend of the year — the television event that annually draws more viewers than presidential debates, inaugurations and State of the Union addresses. The New England Patriots face off against the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl, with Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick seeking their sixth championship since the turn of the century (and their third ring in four years).
But as we approach Sunday, I feel close to zero hype — and it’s not just because this is my nightmare Super Bowl matchup as a New York Giants fan. I’m simply getting sick of all these damn dynasties.
Let’s recap what has happened in the sporting world since the Pats’ trip to the Big Game last season: The Golden State Warriors lifted their second NBA title in their third consecutive trip to the Finals, the Pittsburgh Penguins successfully defended the Stanley Cup for the first time ever in the salary cap era and Alabama topped college football once again to win its fourth national championship of the decade.
Sportswriters love to preach, “appreciate greatness,” during runs of extended dominance. But let’s be honest — in the moment, greatness sucks. Who outside of Alabama, New England or the Bay Area has enjoyed the recent year-to-year repetition? We cherish sports for their unpredictability. Watching the same teams win it all every season eliminates one of the most central reasons why we tune in in the first place. It’s completely irrational, but excellence feels cheap when witnessed so regularly.
So of course, having said all of that, I’m here to tell you: Let’s appreciate the Patriots’ greatness when they (probably) bulldoze the Eagles in Minneapolis.
Because even when compared to their modern counterparts in Tuscaloosa, Pittsburgh or Oakland, the Pats’ preeminence is unprecedented. They will have appeared in eight of the last 17 Super Bowls, and New England last missed the AFC Championship game in 2011. I normally hate when people do this, but here goes: The last time Brady and company didn’t play for a Super Bowl berth, Michael Vick was quarterbacking the Eagles (and Carson Wentz was still a senior in high school). Brandon Moore’s ass hadn’t yet brought an end to Mark Sanchez and “the Sanchize” in New York. Marshawn Lynch had just upset New Orleans with his famous “Beast Quake” run — in Pete Carroll’s debut season with the Seahawks.
With a sixth championship on Sunday, the Patriots will move into a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl wins ever, having won every single title under owner Robert Kraft and the Belichick-Brady brain trust. It’s almost impossible to overstate how remarkable this feat would be in the context of professional football history. Only the San Francisco 49ers rival New England’s string of Lombardi Trophies in the early 21st century (the Niners won four Super Bowls between 1981 and 1990). 
But San Francisco achieved its dynasty thanks to many hands: Jerry Rice — the greatest wide receiver of all time — two of the best quarterbacks to ever play the game in Joe Montana and Steve Young and a pair of legendary coaches in Bill Walsh and George Seifert. No single regime has dominated professional football like Kraft, Belichick and Brady; never have 29 teams gotten such a thorough look at the same beast without exposing  their weaknesses.
When examined closely, this run of success blows the likes of Golden State, Alabama or Pittsburgh out of the water, thanks to one reason: history. Nick Saban was hailed as the greatest college football coach of all time after guiding his Crimson Tide to its fifth national championship in January, but Bear Bryant won six national titles in Tuscaloosa. The Warriors’ two rings and three consecutive trips to the NBA Finals pale in comparison to the Michael Jordan-era Chicago Bulls or the Los Angeles Lakers’ run under Phil Jackson. Back-to-back Stanley Cups are nice, but remember when Wayne Gretzky led the Edmonton Oilers to five championships in six years?
In other words, when it comes to other “dynasties” in modern sports, they are nothing we haven’t seen before. College football, the NBA and NHL have all had powerhouses under a single transcendent coach or player that won championships by the fistful. Meanwhile, the NFL hasn’t had one since the Green Bay Packers played in a 12-team league in the 1950s. With a win on Sunday, the 21st-Century Patriots will earn a title held by arguably no other franchise in any sport: the greatest team in history.
Obviously, this is no lock. After losing a perfect season to a 9-7 Giants team in Super Bowl XLII, Brady and company know better than anyone that everything could go wrong this weekend despite the odds. But if Philadelphia somehow manages to win its first Super Bowl in franchise history, toppling the New England dynasty while riding its backup quarterback, that would be the most exceptional achievement of all.

The summer of 2016 will always be one of the most memorable periods of my life — I graduated from high school, watched Hillary Clinton become the first female presidential nominee from a major political party and voted for the first time all in the span of two months. It was a time of joy and excitement for me, and for better or for worse, the news events I witnessed at this stage in my life exposed me to the real world and forced me to develop my own views. 
Around the same time Clinton won the nomination, a county judge in Santa Clara sentenced a male college student to a few months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. The assault had been witnessed by numerous people, and the assailant had confessed to his wrongdoing — nevertheless, the trial remained preoccupied with misogynistic questions about the survivor’s past, and infuriating reductions of the young man’s crime. 
Progress for women’s rights is often a give and take, an alternating rotation of triumph and frustration. No year singularly encapsulated this more than 2016, and as the aforementioned Brock Turner case returns to the public eye, 2018 promises to be another impactful one.
Circling back to Turner’s case, the sexism underlying the court’s treatment of his victim, in itself, wasn’t what made the case so upsetting to so many survivors and advocates; sexist speculation directed at female survivors is the norm rather than the exception. What distinguished this case was that it had met all criteria to appease the usual skeptics and satisfy the frankly ridiculous standards that sexual assault survivors must meet to be believed. And yet, despite this, the assault was still trivialized and the female victim’s voice and experience still marginalized — all with a six-month county jail sentence for Turner. 
Apparently listening to the pleas of Turner’s father that prison would be “a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action” (he was referring to the assault of the victim), the county judge, Aaron Persky, declined to sentence Turner to the six years in prison recommended by the district attorney. Instead, Persky sentenced Turner to six months in county jail. In Persky’s own words, he was concerned a long sentence “would have a severe impact” on Turner, a young white man whose actions had made a severe, perhaps lifelong impact on a young woman. 
Art by Joscelyn Stocks | Daily Trojan
I remember hearing about Persky for the first time that summer, as justified outrage over the Turner case unearthed his problematic history of leniency involving gang rape and child sexual abuse. At one point, he presided over a trial in which scantily clad photos of a sexual assault survivor were displayed before the jury, which only reinforces the sexist, age-old “asking for it” trope. And this week, Persky was made relevant once again when the Santa Clara County Superior Court announced that a petition to recall Persky had garnered enough signatures to be included on the California primary ballot. In other words, come June, Santa Clara County voters will decide Persky’s fate — and in doing so, could decide whether survivors past and future receive justice.
In many ways, the vote for Persky’s recall is taking place in a society vastly different from that of the People v. Turner. In the age of #MeToo, the bravery and sheer force of women speaking up for themselves and for each other has revamped the political climate into one that amplifies women’s voices and holds men accountable. Of course, there’s work to be done. But the results of Persky’s recall vote could be a crucial measure of how much progress we’ve made since 2016,  and the year that a man convicted of sexual assault was sentenced to six months for assaulting a young woman, the year that media identified him not as the purveyor of an unforgettable crime, but as a gifted swimmer, and withheld his mugshot from the public.
The national conversation around assault is evolving; the typical “both sides” language used by Persky himself in defending his decision is becoming increasingly tired, as we come to recognize that more often than not, the only evidence a survivor is capable of providing is their own testimony, and that testimony must be taken seriously. Survivors should not be forced to either conform to a perfect narrative or be disbelieved, dismissed and attacked; they should not undergo the stress and discomfort of reporting their assault only to be deprived of justice. That is the goal of survivors’ rights advocates, and Persky’s recall brings us one step closer to achieving this.
And yet, the Persky recall vote will function as more than a sign of the times. That we’re even voting to remove him sends a crucial message to survivors that we recognize their trauma, hear their voices and will fight for them. For all the survivors whose experiences have traumatized them into silence, for all the survivors who were forced to relive their trauma upon coming forward to report their experiences, for all the survivors who faced an Aaron Persky,  Santa Clara County voters hear you, believe you and are dedicated to building a legal system that recognizes your humanity and takes your experiences seriously.

Following four fraternity hazing deaths at various schools across the country in 2017 and an alleged on-campus sexual assault by a former UCLA Theta Delta Chi fraternity president, UCLA’s Interfraternity Council has imposed a ban on alcohol at all fraternity events. This ban began on Jan. 16 and will continue indefinitely. The accused UCLA student will appear in court on Feb. 5.
Meanwhile, USC has seen its fair share of alcohol-fueled sexual misconduct scandals similar to the one that prompted UCLA’s recent decision, and these scandals occur both inside and outside of Greek life. In 2013, USC’s Sigma Pi Epsilon chapter was banned for five years for a case of sexual misconduct. But USC has not gone so far as to forbid the possession and consumption of alcohol entirely, despite how the substance impairs judgment and too often leads to assaults, misconduct and situations that threaten student safety. USC’s Greek life suffers from a lack of  regulations on alcohol that adversely affect its members, most obviously those who are rushing or pledging.
In addressing alcohol consumption in fraternities, USC’s Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development code bans “forcing, coercing or permitting students to drink excessive amounts of liquids including alcohol, salt water, water, etc.” among 10 other forms of hazing. Though alcohol is included in this list, it is only unauthorized when in an excess. The only other mention of alcohol in the FSLD Membership Intake Guidelines is the prohibition of alcohol during the presentation of new members to the community. Alcohol is banned from University public spaces (without approval), locker rooms and from the mini-fridges of underage students in University housing, to name a few places. Fraternity houses are not included in the SCampus list of locations where alcohol is prohibited. But in a house with both overage and underage members, alcohol should not be present as well. 
One of the biggest fears in joining a fraternity is hazing, which the USC Hazing Policy explicitly bans. Despite this policy, traditions and practices endure — just under the cover of secrecy. Regulations on hazing are difficult to enforce because hazing is an activity, not a substance — its definition is significantly less clear than the definition of what constitutes alcohol. Regulating a physical substance like alcohol is simpler and more enforceable than a list of somewhat subjective practices that fall under USC’s definition of hazing.
Dealing with alcohol may help alleviate the brunt of hazing. UCLA has called it “a step in the right direction” for the long term, and they may be right. Sororities are a long-standing example of a relationship between a lack of alcohol and lower rates of member deaths and arrests. The National Panhellenic Conference maintains an alcohol-free guideline with the consequence of fines or sorority probation.
USC is implementing some restrictions regarding Greek life, but they offload the responsibility of protecting students by instead depriving them of the fraternity experience. In a 2017 letter, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry stated that freshmen are banned from rushing for  fraternities or sororities until they have 12 completed units, beginning this coming fall. While this is a protective measure for freshmen to ensure that they have time to adapt to college life before being overwhelmed by involvement, it does not address the deeper issue — fraternities are not regulated in several areas that negatively affect their members. Rather than banning freshmen from rushing for  fraternities, the University should create safeguards so that freshmen are not so consumed by Greek life that their academic and personal lives suffer. 
In addition to the four colleges that have experienced a member death from hazing, several other universities have taken to banning alcohol, including the University of Michigan and the University of Idaho. Some are even outright banning Greek life — a severe step that USC does not need. Instead, USC should consider controls in a variety of areas, and restrictions on alcohol may be the first step.

For the USC School of Cinematic Arts Undergraduate Student Council, Showcase could not be a more fitting title for its newly-launched digital magazine that went live on Tumblr last November, compiling students’ creative works and projects all onto one interactive platform.
The SCA Fall 2017 Undergraduate Student Council, including (from left to right) President Raphael Rosalen, Secretary TJ Ryan, Treasurer Alix Winschel and Vice President Felipe Vargas created the magazine. Photo courtesy of Raphael Rosalen.
“We began to realize that although there are amazing student works being created around the clock at SCA, there was really no central location to find them,” Showcase’s website states. “We were eager to create a platform for students to share the works they created during the semester with their peers in all divisions of SCA!”
Former SCA Undergraduate Student Council President Raphael Rosalen, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies, said that he has always been fascinated with the way that media affects society and defines the way humans think about themselves. Last September, in an effort to unite the undergraduate students within SCA as well as students of different majors, he and his team got right to work launching Showcase.
“We were always trying to find a project that could do that,” Rosalen said. “And we had an idea earlier last year to make a magazine and … we came up with this idea of creating a website for the magazine — kind of like a magazine in the format of a website — and we started imagining how that would look like.”
The council aims to release a new issue at the end of each semester. The inaugural edition features an array of different kinds of student content, including film, quizzes and interactive media. 
To garner more interest and publicity for the publication and provide a networking platform for SCA students, the council hosted a launch party in December once the first issue was published on their Tumblr site.
TJ Ryan, a sophomore majoring in film production, has been recently appointed SCA Undergraduate Student Council president for this semester. Ryan found the projects that students contributed to the first issue were not only creative but also impressive. 
“Personally, I think a favorite of mine was an animation project that the student did where she took different candies and animated them into these really interesting intricate patterns and movements,” Ryan said.
With its inaugural edition published, the council is anticipating a successful second issue this April. 
According to Ryan, the SCA major representatives within the council have the important job of reaching out to students in their specific major and seeking out projects for publication.

The USC Keck School of Medicine has appointed Hugo Rosen as the new Chair of the Department of Medicine. He will begin his new position on May 1.
Photo from Keck website.
As a clinical program-builder and translational, clinical and basic science researcher, Rosen is a physician-scientist from the University of Colorado, where he has served as the head of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology since 2005. 
He is known for the improvement and expansion of his department while at the University of Colorado, bringing in 45 new faculty members and raising his division to be one of the highest rated in the country.
Rosen plans to improve Keck by implementing the bench-to-bedside paradigm, in which scientists use their own research to aid their patients. He believes that the combination of the  Keck School, the Keck Medical Center of USC and Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center will help to accomplish this goal. 
“This is a pivotal juncture to promote the art and science of medicine, in Los Angeles and internationally, by training the next generation of leaders through comprehensive education, career development, transformative research and world-class patient care,” Rosen said in a USC News release.
With more than 180 peer-reviewed manuscripts detailing investigations into cellular and molecular underpinnings of innate and adaptive immune responses, Rosen looks forward to his new appointment.
“I’m deeply honored and thrilled to embrace this once-in-a-generation opportunity and the sacred responsibility of leading the Department of Medicine at USC,” Rosen said in the news release. “I’m impressed with the entire biomedical enterprise, the commitment to compassionate patient care and the institutional focus on innovation and convergence across multiple disciplines.”

The Debbie & Blake presidential ticket (left) debated against the Mai & Brianna presidential ticket (right) at Wallis Annenberg Hall Thursday. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Annenberg Media hosted the first Undergraduate Student Government presidential debate on Wednesday night at Wallis Annenberg Hall. USG Senators Debbie Lee and Blake Ackerman, candidates for president and vice president, debated against USG Director of External Affairs Mai Mizuno and Brianna Bozek, a junior majoring in business administration, who are also running for president and vice president.
The debate was moderated by Annenberg Media correspondent Brittany Hope. 
Lee began her opening statement by explaining why she and Ackerman are pursuing these offices. Lee and Ackerman have a history serving together prior to their time in the Senate, as they served as president and vice president at Beverly Hills High School together, each occupying both positions at different times.
“This year, Blake and I had the opportunity to serve as senators and while continuing through this term, we’ve realized that our heart and passion to serve all students and listen to their voices and needs extended far beyond our duties,” Lee said. 
In her opening statement, Mizuno cited the fact that she and Bozek had not served in student government prior to USC as positive traits, allowing them to have optimistic and different visions for their potential roles in USG. 
Mizuno also noted that she entered USC as a spring admit, and that these students, along with transfer students, deserve a greater voice in USG because they are often treated as “second-class Trojans.”
“Prior to coming to [USC], I had never been in student government before,” Mizuno said. “And I found this to be extremely beneficial because, like Brianna, I didn’t know what student government was. I just knew what it should be.”
While Mizuno has three years of experience in USG under her belt, Bozek has no student government experience. Bozek referred to their ticket multiple times during the debate as an “insider-outsider ticket.”
One of the major issues discussed at the debate was tuition hikes at USC and overall affordability of college costs for students. Lee advocated for a pragmatic and moderate approach.
“Something that I’ve learned during my year as a senator is that a tuition freeze is just impossible, but something that we can focus on is increasing transparency in regards to tuition,” Lee said. 
Ackerman broke down the specifics of how he and Lee view tuition. He also mentioned their idea for a resource that can help economically disadvantaged students navigate their financial  troubles.
“Debbie and I believe that tuition can be broken down into two parts, and that’s transparency and affordability,” Ackerman said. “To encourage more affordability, we want to propose an economic crisis response team for students that are food insecure or housing insecure to make sure they are getting what they need.”
Mizuno invoked her record of activism and advocacy regarding affordable tuition at USC, specifically the $2,000 tuition hike in the spring 2016 semester.
“When I started out at USC, I was an activist and tuition hikes were what I cared about,” Mizuno said. “I was out on Trousdale every single day protesting tuition hikes.”
Another topic at the debate was mental health and mental health resources on campus. Lee mentioned the inaccessibility of the Engemann Student Health Center and proposed a way to increase mental-health oriented spaces on campus.
“I think, also, one of the issues that we face with Engemann is that it’s simply a little far and a little out of the way for most students to access,” Lee said. “And that’s why Blake and I want to highlight the establishment of resident meditation spaces on campus.”
Bozek brought up a personal anecdote, saying that she has experienced the lack of resources allocated for mental health issues on campus.
“I think that we need more counselors, and even though that’s a really expensive solution to the problem, I think it can be done if we take the necessary prior steps,” Bozek said. “I’d love to see a state of mental health survey at USC to see where we’re at and what USC needs.”   
Another central topic in the debate was how to improve Greek life at USC. Ackerman noted a policy proposal on his ticket’s platform.
“Also on our platform are speed bumps for Greek Row,” Ackerman said. “We really want to ensure that safety on 28th Street is a big priority and we know that people drive fast on that street.”
Bozek advocated for more cooperation between students and the administration regarding Greek life.
“We would love to implement regular meetings between Greek life leaders, USG and administration in order to increase transparency on Greek-life sanctions and also to work with the community in order to better it as much as we can,” Bozek said. 
Other topics discussed at the debate included recent changes to the Norman Topping Fund, diversity on campus and the creation of a new USG Director position that would engage students in state and federal politics, a motion proposed earlier this week at a USG Senate meeting. 
The next presidential debate, called “The Inclusion Discussion,” will be on Tuesday at 7:45 p.m. at Wallis Annenberg Hall.

The Delta Tau Delta fraternity hosted a party Friday that featured a theme some considered offensive, according to multiple students who attended the party. 
The fraternity advertised the party as “Black Friday.” The Daily Trojan acquired photos showing a poster that said “For the Culture” on the side of the Delta Tau Delta house and a photo from inside the party, where the name “Jemimah” was spray painted on the side of a table.
Posters and graffiti from the Delta Tau Delta party on Friday, Jan. 26 depict phrases such as “For the Culture” and “Jemimah.” Photos obtained by the Daily Trojan.
Kelsey Hawkins, a sophomore majoring in lifespan health, went into the Delta Tau Delta house after seeing the posters outside. 
“It wasn’t anything too explicit — we were afraid we were going to walk in and see a scene like something from Dear White People, [and] that obviously wasn’t the case, but it was still really upsetting,” Hawkins said. 
Along with posters that indicated a race-based theme, the decorations and attire of the fraternity’s members allegedly perpetuated racial stereotypes, according to Hawkins and another student at the party who wished to remain anonymous. They both said that there was graffiti on the walls and that many of the fraternity’s members wore basketball jerseys. 
 
Photo obtained by the Daily Trojan.
However, multiple other sources saw nothing unusual at the party. 
Shreya Sridhara, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, attended the party and said that she perceived the theme to be referring to the black lights present in the house and not a reference to race. 
“They had these cool black light-esque lights swirling around, and they had smoke or fog machines that made cool patterns,” Sridhara said. 
Similarly, a Facebook event description for the party made no reference to race. 
“There will be mobs of people waiting outside trying to get in,” the description said. “The only difference is at DTD, we like to take Black Friday very literally. That means we’re blacking everything out from the windows to the walls. Come with your clothes blacked out and leave even more blacked out.”
Sridhara also said she remembers seeing writing on the walls, but does not remember what any of the writing said. 
Delta Tau Delta treasurer Mario Blanco said in a statement emailed to the Daily Trojan that the fraternity was unaware of any insensitive themes. 
“We have not received any reports, nor do we know of any culturally insensitive decorations or themes at our party on Jan. 26; however, if any elements were interpreted as being offensive, it was not our intent and we certainly apologize,” Blanco said in the statement. “Our fraternity places great value on cultural diversity and respect, so should any student become concerned about any of our events, we encourage them to reach out to our chapter at mjblanco98@gmail.com.”
However, Hawkins said that she believed the decorations were intentionally offensive. 
“You don’t have a ‘Black Friday’ party and put a ‘For the Culture’ sign outside and say that it was an accident,” Hawkins said. “Nothing like that in this day and age can be called an accident.”
The Interfraternity Council declined to comment on the party.
The allegations come amid a history of racially insensitive theme parties at college fraternities across America. 
In 2015, students at UCLA protested after students wore blackface and baggy clothes to a “Kanye Western”-themed party hosted by the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and Alpha Phi sorority, the Daily Bruin reported. 
Although there have not been other reports of such parties at USC in the past, according to a Daily Trojan article from 2015, then-USG president Rini Sampath reported that a fraternity member hurled a drink at her and shouted, “You Indian piece of sh-t!” while she was walking on the Row.

Walking down Jefferson Boulevard, Taco Window stands out among the other beautifully muraled walls with its freeform red, yellow and green chili pepper paintings and the mouth-watering scent of fresh tacos it emanates. 
Only two miles west of USC’s campus, Taco Window is exactly what its name implies — a small, fast-casual eatery comprised of two sliding glass windows dividing a painted brick wall, through which one can get a glimpse of chef Basile Bouhadida flipping fresh, homemade corn tortillas. Friendly and cheerful, he leans out the window and calls people over to pick up their orders, all while maintaining a positive attitude.
Bouhadida moved to Los Angeles six years ago from Northern France, and has since steeped himself in the city’s cultural cuisine: tacos. Taco Window opened near the end of 2017, fulfilling his culinary dream to own a restaurant. He brings a European touch to the various sauces and salsas that accompany his tacos and ceviche, keeping their overall flavors muted in order to highlight the boldly marinated meat.
Bouhadida’s menu features five tacos — fish, pork, chorizo, carne asada and grilled chicken as well as one white fish ceviche on tostada. Each taco is $2.50, and $20 can get you one of each along with the ceviche, as well as a side of chips and salsa. 
Basile Bouhadida, the chef behind Taco Window, moved to Los Angeles six years ago from France and opened up the shop in late 2017. Photo from Yelp.
One of the most popular tacos is the fish taco, served with a creamy jalapeño aioli. Each cut of white fish is battered and deep fried, but so light and fluffy that it is easy to overlook how the fish is almost bigger than the tortilla itself. With a single tostada and no rice, beans or other fillings, Bouhadida makes it very clear that the meat is the centerpiece of each taco. There is, of course, the option of adding chopped onion and cilantro on top, which adds another layer of flavor and texture to the taco. 
Though there are only a few menu items, each option contains plenty of surprises for the taste buds, and customers are tempted to try each taco for its individual flavors. The homemade chorizo taco comes as a surprise, as it is not dry as chorizo usually is. Instead, it is thick and mixed with red chili. The pork in the salsa verde taco has a vague American and Filipino influence, as the pulled pork is soaked in salsa using the same technique as cooking in BBQ sauce for a pulled pork sandwich or in liver sauce for the Filipino dish lechon. However, the grilled chicken taco lives up to its reputation — less deeply marinated and slightly on the dry side. 
The only dessert on the menu is a homemade churro, served in a crunchy white paper bag lettered with Taco Window’s typewriter-font logo. It also defies the Disneyland churro stereotype in sweetness; Basile downplays the sugar and cinnamon in favor of the inner texture of the churro, instead emulating the texture of a thick coconut flan. 
Taco Window is a worthwhile walk for the ambitious (or a relatively cheap Lyft for those who are in a rush), and though it is a bit pricier than the average taco truck, Basile’s flavors are singularly fresh and filling.

Deb Margolin, acclaimed performance artist and playwright, lead a playwriting workshop Wednesday afternoon at Joyce Cammilleri Hall in conjunction with USC Visions and Voices.
Actress and playwright Deb Margolin will lead two workshops on playwriting and performance on Wednesday and Friday as well as perform a solo rendition of 8 Stops on Thursday. Photo from USC Visions and Voices.
The event, which was capped at 20 attendees, gave Margolin the chance to converse with her audience and establish a rapport. Rather than mounting a platform and delivering a lecture, she directed everyone to sit together in a circle onstage, giving the event a more intimate, relaxed atmosphere.
Margolin began by reading a passage from a tattered horoscope book, which she had picked up while in line at a CVS drugstore the day before she was due to begin teaching at New York University’s graduate theatre program. Reading the passage had become a ritual for her before engaging in any activity related to theatre.
“‘Moon in Libra youngsters are quick-witted, clever individuals,’” Margolin read from the book. “‘Their artistic and musical talents will be used to teach and inspire others. Their students, in turn, gain far greater fame, to credit these individuals for the important role they play as teachers.’”
Margolin spoke passionately on the topic of how to draw writing material from real life. She recalled an anecdote where she was riding a bus and wrote down all the wild conspiracy theories that the woman sitting next to her was spewing, corroborating the aphorism that truth is stranger than fiction.   
“I wanted to spend such time as we have together to work on reminding ourselves about the clear and lasting relationship that we can always tap between the desire to create material for the theatre and the source from which such material comes and can always come,” Margolin said.
Margolin also stressed the importance of keeping a notebook within reach at all times, because writers are constantly observing the world around them and inspiration could strike at any moment.
“As artists, we are working all the time,” Margolin said. “The work does not go on when you sit at your typewriter or notebook. The work is constant, the work is going on all the time. As writers, we need to elevate our consciousness to the fact that life is our source, we belong to each other and we have collapsible boundaries.”
Margolin emphasized that everyone experiences writer’s block, but one need only become aware of the wealth of information that surrounds us daily (and nightly) to realize that there is no shortage of things to write about.
“It is your birthright, it’s not specific to you, every single person has this. There is no such thing as writer’s block,” Margolin said.
“Every night you go to sleep and you dream in rich, resonant imagery. What we need to do as writers, what I need to remind myself and what I need to remind you about, is getting obstacles to that source, the constant poet, out of the way.” 
After going around the circle and asking each participant their name and motivations for attending the workshop, Margolin then asked the audience to engage in an exercise called “Fill in the blank,” in which everyone completed a phrase that Margolin tossed out, such as: “I remember…” or “My relationship with God is like my relationship with…”
Margolin received the Obie Award for Sustained Excellence in Performance in 2000. She currently teaches playwriting and performance as an associate professor at Yale University. Margolin is scheduled for two more events this week; she will perform her one-woman show 8 Stops on Thursday evening and she will lead another workshop about performing on Friday afternoon.

Who else was furious that Bruno Mars won Best Album over Kendrick Lamar at the GRAMMY Awards this past Sunday?
After the rapper had already lost the coveted award twice, I was certain that the Grammys would follow the popular saying, “third time’s the charm,” and give Kendrick the highest honors. DAMN. was his most commercially successful album, as it received a double platinum in the United States and reached No. 1 on the Billboard’s Top 200 Albums of the Year. 
As I searched through the internet, I stumbled upon a tweet claiming the Grammys always goes with the “safest” pick when it comes to their awards. It was at this moment that I realized I would never find satisfaction if I continued to operate within a rigid set of expectations for my life.
Just as fans learn to face harsh realities when their favorite artists are not recognized, we each must learn how to face the harsh reality that life doesn’t always go as planned. The biggest problems that plague my life are the expectations I set for myself. I entertain ideas that certain events will happen in specific ways, and whenever a scenario doesn’t play out exactly how I wanted it to, I become more frustrated than I should be. This reaction can result from something as significant as rushing a friend’s fraternity to something as meaningless as mapping out the exact path I take to class.
I suppose one thing I should get in the habit of doing is thinking realistically. Usually, I’m so focused on trying to get things to happen my way that I don’t bother wondering what would happen if something happened differently.
For instance, when I transferred to USC, I hoped to maintain the same circle of friends I already had here in Southern California as I settled in. However, one of my friends advised me to create new social circles, suggesting that we may not be able to meet as frequently as I initially hoped. At the time, I misunderstood him and took this to be a passive-aggressive way to cut all connections with me. My mother later explained the reality of the situation and my friend’s wisdom in wanting me to find my own niche in the USC community. Blinded by my own selfishness, I completely overreacted.

Perhaps it was the long and arduous goal of transferring to USC that laid the foundation for my fixed set of expectations. I was so intent on transferring that I was unwilling to consider any alternative options. Although I had already been rejected during freshman admissions, I knew I wanted to attend this University. 
And yet, alternative outcomes are never as bad as you originally think. I was originally devastated that I did not get into USC as a high school senior, but being able to transfer as a sophomore ended up being the best path for me. As for how this lesson relates to the dashed hopes and dreams of music lovers, one must consider the various factors that go into decisions like the Grammys.
Looking back on this Sunday, I have come to accept that Bruno Mars appealed more to Grammy voters. 24K Magic was arguably his most successful album, and his other wins for Best Song and Best Record reflected this. He recently dropped the successful “Finesse (Remix)” earlier this year, and took it to the stage with Cardi B for one of the best performances of the night. Much like his previous album, Mars’ approach to 24K Magic was to take inspiration from musical artists of the past decades, which is what likely drew the attention of voters. When all things are considered, 24K Magic isn’t a bad album.
On the other hand, DAMN. wasn’t nearly as awe-inspiring as good kid, m.A.A.d. city or To Pimp a Butterfly. Even though the 2017 album contained some of Kendrick’s most mainstream songs (yes, even more so than “Swimming Pools”), it also has a structure and loose narrative that could seem strange to mainstream listeners. Additionally, Kendrick himself said that winning awards like the Grammys does not confirm his success, after Macklemore publicly apologized for receiving an award over him. I still wanted Kendrick to win because he deserves the award. But I’ve come to accept Mars’ win.
When comparing Lamar’s and Mars’ albums, it became easy for me to realize that this was not a situation in which DAMN. was so amazing that it needed to win Best Album. It is much more complicated than that; award shows do not make decisions on objective quality alone. I guess I still have to learn to not have such rigid hopes because, as I heard Bono annonce Bruno Mars’ name, I thought, “Alright, this isn’t nearly as inexcusable as To Pimp a Butterfly losing to 1989.”

After a successful trip up north where the women’s basketball team secured two wins against Washington and Washington State, the Trojans return home to play crosstown nemesis UCLA twice. 
Junior guard Sadie Edwards goes up for a layup against Stanford last week. Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan
The team will play the first matchup at Pauley Pavilion on Friday before returning home for a second matchup at Galen Center next Monday. The Trojans now stand at 15-6 with a 5-5 Pac-12 conference record after their sweep in Washington. 
UCLA is ranked No. 9 in the most recent rankings and has a 17-4 record with an 8-2 conference record. Since losing against Oregon on Jan. 7, they have won their previous six games against the likes of Utah, Colorado, Stanford, California, Washington and Washington State. UCLA boasts an impressive record of 8-2 at Pauley Pavilion and an equally impressive 7-2 on the road. 
“It’s a rivalry,” senior forward Kristen Simon said of the USC-UCLA rivalry. “A lot of the people on UCLA I grew up with, I played [in] high school with. So it’s a fun game, but it’s just another game for us. Just the intensity of [the rivalry], the crowd’s into it, it’s fun. It’s a fun game because the intensity is just a little bit higher since it’s a rivalry.” 
UCLA is led by a trio of guards Jordin Canada and Kennedy Burke and forward Monique Billings. Canada is the team’s leading scorer at 15.6 points per game but she also contributes in other areas: 3.7 rebounds, 6.3 assists and an intimidating 3.3 steals per game. Billings averages 14.6 points to go along with 9.6 rebounds, 1.1 steals and 1.6 blocks, while Burke brings a versatile defensive game averaging two steals and one block coupled with a modest 10.8 scoring average. 
UCLA also sports a deep and well-balanced team capable of shouldering the load alongside their leading scorers. Guards Japreece Dean and Kelli Hayes are threatening shooters with a shooting average of 37.1 percent and a 35.7 percent from deep respectively; both of their 3-point percentages climb to an identical 38.2 percent against conference opponents. Forwards Lajahna Drummer and Michaela Onyenwere are also bench contributors who can score. Drummer also averages 6.8 rebounds per game. 
“They’re just so athletic, they play so hard and Cori Close does a great job,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “They play together, they get up and down the court, their transition is really good. [Canada] is one of the top players in the country and [Billings] is one of the top post in the country. They’re talented and loaded and they play hard, so it’s going to be a challenge, but it’s going to be fun going up against one of the top teams in the country.”

USC will have its hands full against a loaded UCLA squad that is capable of scoring a lot and playing great defense. One of the keys to watch for in these two matchups will be rebounding, as UCLA’s starting frontcourt of Billings and Drummer averages a combined 16.4 rebounds. USC will look for a total team effort on the glass spearheaded by Simon, who grabbed a total of 27 rebounds against the Washington teams. Other keys will be defense and turnovers. Both USC and UCLA excel on the defensive end of the floor in disrupting offensive flow and limiting the number of buckets scored, and capitalizing on turnovers could be key to taking the game. 
“For us, it’s our intensity, bringing our intensity, bringing our defense, everything starts for us on defense, everything that we do good is on defense,” Simon said. “So [we have to] make sure we bring our defensive intensity there.” 
Trahk knows his team will need to bring some hustle in order to beat UCLA.
“We gotta get back in transition,” coach Trakh said. “We gotta limit their offensive rebounding and we gotta limit turnovers.Those are the three most important things.” 
An intriguing matchup to note between these two teams will be between USC’s sophomore guard Minyon Moore and Canada — both are electrifying lead guards with similar playing styles and a knack for stealing the ball. Moore relies on her quickness and speed to exploit openings in defense and attack if the space opens up, but is a willing passer and gets her teammates involved often. Canada also has great speed, loves attacking the paint with craftiness and finesse and is an adept passer who sets up teammates with great precision. 
“I just think [Moore and Canada] are athletic, they both defend, they both get up and down the floor, they both run their teams,” Trakh said. “So it will be an interesting matchup for sure.”
The Trojans will visit Pauley Pavilion Friday at 8 p.m. before hosting the Bruins Monday at 6 p.m. Both games can be watched live on Pac-12 Network.
“It’s going to be a great rivalry,” Trakh said. “It’s for bragging rights for a year so we’re going to be going at each other in the game. It’s going to be a lot of fun!”

The No. 13 USC men’s volleyball team prepares for a two-game road trip in Illinois this upcoming weekend.

Having lost five-straight games and coming off of a three-set sweep to No. 1 Long Beach State, USC faces another tough challenge, with No. 8 Lewis and No. 7 Loyola-Chicago up next. 
After starting their season with three consecutive losses, Lewis has been on a roll, winning five straight games, including an impressive 3-1 win over then-No. 9 Cal State Northridge. Lewis’ best player as of late has been redshirt freshman middle blocker TJ Murray, the reigning MIVA Defensive Player of the Week. Murray had a combined 14 blocks and 21 kills while hitting .647 and .667 in the Flyers’ recent two wins over Cal State Northridge and No. 14 UC Santa Barbara. 
Loyola has been equally hot, winning its last four matches with only two dropped sets in that span. The Ramblers’ last three wins have all been over AVCA top 25 teams, including UC Santa Barbara and Cal State Northridge as well. 
This will be the fifth all-time match between Loyola and USC, as the Ramblers seek their first-ever win over the Trojans. 
This weekend, the USC men’s volleyball team will have to play confidently in order to come away with two wins. Offensively, they will rely heavily on redshirt junior outside hitter Jack Wyett, who is leading the team with 107 kills. 
Fellow junior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso will hopefully continue his aggressive attacking and increase his already growing number of service aces. Additionally, junior outside hitter Ryan Moss will be a contributor offensively, as he has been all season with a remarkable hitting percentage. 
The Trojans will also need to rely on outstanding freshman middle blocker Sam Lewis. Lewis has the highest hitting percentage on the team by a significant margin (0.383) and he will look to continue to play with that momentum. Redshirt junior Connor Inlow will be another threat in the middle blocker position. 
Of course, none of this offensive game would be possible without the setting duo of redshirt senior Gert Lisha and freshman Chris Hall. Lisha currently averages 6.14 assists per set, while Hall is averaging 8.95. Holding down the defensive game, junior libero Matt Douglas will continue to create opportunities for the offense and remain a solid presence on the court, alongside freshman libero Cole Paxson.
Though USC’s record is not pretty (3-5), the Trojans still remain ranked in the top 15 largely because of their brutal schedule; five of their first eight games have been against top 10 teams, and all but the season opener have been on the road. If the Trojans can pull off at least one upset, they should be prepared for a strong February, with four home games and two in nearby Malibu and Westwood.

One year ago, the concept of playing in a Super Bowl was far from Nelson Agholor’s mind. After turning in a second consecutive season that fell short of the expectations that come with being a first-round NFL draft pick, Agholor was not only worried about his team’s success but also his job security.
Wide receiver Nelson Agholor shined at USC from 2012-14. Daily Trojan file photo.
A notoriously difficult place to play professional sports, Philadelphia caused Agholor to bear the brunt of the frustration felt by the city’s sports fans following back-to-back 7-9 seasons and a playoff drought that had entered its third year. 
Playing as an outside receiver rather than in the slot where he had succeeded greatly as one in a long line of star Trojan wideouts, Nelson struggled, catching only 59 of 114 passes thrown his way (a less than stellar 51.8 percent catch rate) for 648 yards and three scores. Making matters worse, Nelson was eventually benched for a game late in the 2016 season by head coach Doug Pederson.
After an underwhelming beginning to his NFL career, there was speculation that he would be a part of a planned overhaul with the Eagles to boost them into playoff contention. Despite fan expectations, Agholor was not only retained for the 2017 season but also moved back into his natural slot position after the Eagles traded receiver Jordan Matthews to the Bills in August. Adding outside playmakers Torrey Smith and Alshon Jeffery further freed up the former Trojan to focus on regaining strength as a slot weapon. That is exactly what Agholor became in 2017 — a weapon.
More than doubling his career totals across the board, Agholor turned in one of the best bounce-back performances of any player in the NFL this season. Going from an afterthought on the outside to a dynamic slot receiver, Agholor caught 62 passes for 768 yards and eight touchdowns in 2017. In an offense that boasts talents like Jeffery, running back Jay Ajayi and tight end Zach Ertz, Agholor has established himself as one of the absolute key pieces.
While Nelson is no stranger to having weight on his shoulders, from single-handedly leading his high school Berkeley Prep to its first state finals run in school history to countless primetime Pac-12 games at the Coliseum, he will certainly be looking forward to the incomparable spectacle dubbed “The Big Game.”
This year, Agholor will be the sole USC alumnus to participate in the Super Bowl. Sixty Trojans have previously competed in the game, which is the third most of any school according to NFL.com. 
Three Trojans, current USC Athletic Director and former Steelers receiver Lynn Swann (1976), Raiders running back Marcus Allen (1984) and Seahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith (2014) went on to capture Super Bowl MVP awards for their performances. Agholor will look to join that group on Sunday.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
On Monday, USC announced a new naming rights deal for the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with United Airlines, signing over the name of the historic sporting venue in exchange for $69 million.
 At base level, this is a simple argument. The deal is an easy way to make cash, and we all know USC loves cash.
 But look at the optics. Look at what we’re going to be calling the Coliseum — this hallowed landmark, the home of two Olympic Games (and soon to be a third in 2028) from now on: the United Airlines Memorial Coliseum. Yuck.
 First off, they literally replaced “Los Angeles” with “United Airlines.” That just sounds pathetic, and honestly, nobody will ever say the words, “What a great game we saw at the United Airlines Memorial Coliseum last night!” I wouldn’t say those words even if United paid me a royalty every time I uttered their company’s name.
 Second, of all the airlines out there, it is United, a company best-known for always coming through with that clutch, three-hour flight delay and for dragging screaming passengers off of planes. Lord help us if they ever overbook games at the Coliseum.
 In all seriousness, this decision boiled down to USC putting profits over tradition, sacrificing history to make a few bucks. Immediate reactions on social media were, as expected, not so popular. But University president C. L. Max Nikias felt proud enough to post not one, not two, but three pictures on his Instagram account from Monday’s groundbreaking ceremony of a $270 million renovation project at the Coliseum, where he also announced the naming rights deal.
 “L.A. Coliseum was one of the few classy stadiums with no corporate name left,” one commenter responded. “Too bad.”
 That is true. We’re used to referring to stadiums by their corporate names by now — STAPLES Center, Petco Park, Levi’s Stadium. That’s why these companies break the bank to have their names in big letters: It is an advertising tool that is almost guaranteed to gain attention.
 But there is something to be said about keeping a stadium’s traditional name. Usually, these are historical sporting venues that a casual fan might know: Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Yankee Stadium in New York, Fenway Park in Boston, Wrigley Field in Chicago, Lambeau Field in Green Bay, the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
 Before the San Francisco 49ers moved to Levi’s Stadium, they played for decades at Candlestick Park, a stadium located on Candlestick Point, known for its windy, bone-chilling and terrible conditions, but also for hosting the 49ers dynasty of the 1980s that featured multiple Super Bowl runs, as well as the infamous 1989 World Series between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland A’s that was interrupted by the Loma Prieta Earthquake. Its name endeared itself so deeply with San Francisco residents that after two highly criticized naming rights deals, residents voted for a proposition to restrict the team’s ability to sell its naming rights.
 “It was a dump,” former 49ers wide receiver Dwight Clark once said of Candlestick Park, “but it was our dump.”
 Compared to other, newer college football stadiums, the Coliseum might, too, be considered “a dump.” The seats are old and rusty, the concourse looks corroded and — speaking for a friend here — the press box needs an upgrade (read: air conditioning!). So, this $270 million makeover is necessary.
 “If we’re not changing and moving forward, then we’re stagnant and other schools will pass us up and we won’t be relevant in terms of our facilities,” Athletic Director Lynn Swann said. “There’s a need for change every step of the way.”
 Swann also added that United’s partnership was key to funding the renovations, which adds to the conundrum. At a school like USC, where boosters and alumni almost always stand behind tradition and legacy, is selling the name of the historic Coliseum worth it to maintain and renovate that piece of tradition?
 Sadly, in this day and age, where everything must be modern, sleek and state-of-the-art, the answer is yes. Despite the fact that “Los Angeles” is literally being removed from the name, the fact that the sponsor is my least favorite airline and the fact that no one will ever call the stadium by its new official name, this deal is a necessary evil for USC to undergo.
 Just remember, though, that the Coliseum should,  and will, always remain just that — the Coliseum. It is forever and ever “our dump.” It belongs to us, not to an airline company.
