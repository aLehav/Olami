The men’s swimming team is preparing to compete in this week’s Pac-12 Swimming and Diving Championships, in an effort to improve on last year’s performance. 
Though USC didn’t win last year’s championships, individual athletes showed promising abilities. Then-freshman Chris O’Grady placed second in the 100-yard breaststroke and broke the USC school record in the 200-yard breaststroke. In men’s diving, then-junior George Korovin won first place in platform diving, while then-freshman Shangfei Wang took third in 1-meter diving. 
This year, the Pac-12 Championships are held in Federal Way, Washington. Men’s diving kicked off on Wednesday with a win by freshman Laurent Gosselin-Paradis, who ended the day as the 1-meter diving champion. On Thursday, Korovin took first in the 3-meter event, while Gosselin-Paradis took second place. Diving competitions closed out on Friday with Gosselin-Paradis winning platform, and USC swept the men’s diving events for the first time since 1999.
This week sees the start of men’s swimming, which will last from March 1-4. The Trojans will look to perform well in the relays, the 500-yard freestyle, the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke, and the 200-yard backstroke, all of which they placed highly in last year.
Graduate student Jackson Odgers, who will be competing in the 100-yard and 200-yard butterfly and the 200-yard individual medley, is excited for his last chance at the Pac-12 Championships.
“The last time around, it’s a little bit special, [I’m] excited to give everything I got compared to last year,” Odgers said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We ended up placing super well compared to the years prior. And this year, we’re hoping to build off of that and try to keep moving up the scoreboard.”
Senior sprint and middle distance freestyler Max Saunders is also enthusiastic about the Pac-12s. 
“This is potentially my last Pac-12,” Saunders said. “So I’m just [saying to myself,] ‘Last one fast one.’ It’s not my first time doing this, so I’m gonna try to have fun and lead by example, hype people up.”
Saunders will swim in the 50-yard, 100-yard, and 200-yard freestyle races, as well as the freestyle relays. In terms of the team, Saunders and Odgers both emphasized the new talent coming in.
“One of the most fun parts is seeing how all of our newcomers do because it’s their first time at a college meet and they always impress themselves and blow themselves away with the times they can do,” Odgers said. “And I think as a team, feeding off of each other’s energy is what really gets you to go fast at these championship meets.”
Saunders noted that the team has been more energetic this year, too.
“The positivity on the pool deck has been a lot better,” Saunders said. “Just a lot of camaraderie, a lot more than it’s been in the past couple years, which is extremely exciting.”
Though he’s happy to compete, Saunders remains realistic about USC’s chances to win the Pac-12s, which they have not won since 2015. 
“We’ll definitely have some individual guys really causing some problems for some bigger teams at the moment, but on the[a] more team scale I don’t think we’ll be that close[know],” Saunders said.
Individual performances in the Pac-12 Championships help determine who will move on to the NCAA National Championships, which Odgers is looking to compete in.
“On a personal level, the chance to qualify for national championships is what excites me the most, especially in my final season. That’s going to be a tall order, but it’s gonna be fun to try to do it,” Odgers said.
Saunders is also optimistic about the swimmers’ chances of moving on to the NCAAs this year, but especially for future years.
“[We’re in this] transition phase where we had a lot of talent last year that moved on. Some of the younger guys really stepped up this year, and we got some great talent coming in next year,” Saunders said. “As someone who’s in their last year of swimming, I’m extremely hopeful for the future and excited to see what a lot of these guys are going to do [this] week and beyond.”
The team will look to replicate their title-winning success from 2015 as they head to Washington Wednesday to race in the Pac-12 Championships.

The Trojans eked out a 68-65 double-overtime win against Washington State Saturday afternoon. After their victory against Washington Thursday night, the Trojans wrapped up the regular season with a sweep of the Washington schools before they head into postseason play. 
After the first quarter, the Trojans were just 4-18 from the field, shooting 22.2%. During the second quarter, their shooting woes continued and at halftime, they were just 6-34 from the field and shooting 7.1% from beyond the arc. On the other end of the floor, Washington State seemed to make everything they threw at the basket, shooting well over 50% from the field. 
“The way we came into the game, we were just not ready,” said graduate forward Kadi Sissoko in a postgame press conference. “We knew before the game that it was gonna  be a dogfight, so we had to wake up and I knew we was capable of doing better than this.”
Coming out of halftime, the Trojans remained resilient and battled through, using their defensive efficiency to balance out their struggles on offense. The Trojans held the lead for just 2 minutes of play while the Cougars maintained the lead for over 39 minutes. 
“Credit to our players, they decided who we are and what we are is gonna be to ‘give it our best effort,’” said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb in a postgame conference. “[There] was a togetherness, a toughness. It was unreal.”
The Trojans came alive in the fourth quarter, making 6 of their 10 field goal attempts, including 8 free throws while holding Washington State to 9 points. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Trojans were down by 12 points and, despite surges by USC throughout the second half, the Cougars seemed to never fold. However, the Trojans used a 7-point run to start the fourth quarter, successfully pursuing a comeback that would end with redshirt freshman guard Taylor Bigby scoring 3 straight points to send the game to overtime. 
In the first period of overtime, the Trojans found themselves down by 3 points with just over a minute and a half left to play. No more than 30 seconds later, graduate guard Okako Adika splashed a 3-pointer to send the game to yet another overtime, where the Trojans would eventually prevail over the Cougars, outscoring them 8-5 in the second period of overtime. 
Throughout the season, the Trojans have consistently looked to their senior leadership, consisting of Sissoko, graduate guard Destiny Littleton and graduate guard Rokia Doumbia, who had 18, 14 and 13 points respectively in Sunday’s game. 
“Having a lot of transfers and seniors who are mature enough to know what it takes to win a game and what it means to not do the little things, such as when things are not going great,” Doumbia said in a postgame conference. 
Sophomore forward Rayah Marshall had 7 points, and Bigby came off the bench and tacked on 11 more points.
“Bigby is essentially our only freshman,” Gottlieb said. “Sometimes her minutes go up and her minutes go down, [but] she’s committed to this group because of these leaders, because of the older players.”
Marshall had 3 blocks in today’s game, bringing her season total to 89. She now sits in third place for the most amount of blocks by a Trojan in a single season. In the past seven games, Marshall has recorded an average of 4.57 blocks per game and now has at least 1 block in 49 consecutive games. 
One other factor that played a significant role in today’s game was the home crowd that surrounded the Trojans and cheered them on to victory. 
“It’s amazing,” Sissoko said. “I love the atmosphere. I love Galen Center.”
USC forced 23 turnovers, marking the 28th time this year that the Trojans’ opponents have had 10 or more turnovers. The Trojans also had 12 steals against the Cougars, which makes it the 12th game this year in which they have had double-digit steals. As the Trojans look forward to the Pac-12 tournament, which starts next week and goes from March 1-5 in Las Vegas, they will look to continue playing with their defensive efficiency that is made up of forcing turnovers and creating steals. 
USC will play against Oregon State in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament March 1 at 8:30 p.m.

The spring season is heating up as No. 24 women’s tennis prepares to host its crosstown rival this morning. The game was originally planned for Friday, but got postponed due to rain. The last time USC and UCLA faced off, the Trojans snapped a 5-game losing streak against the Bruins to conclude the 2022 regular season. Head Coach Alison Swain and the 6-2 Trojans are  looking to sustain their newfound success Monday morning. 
“We love playing at home, it’s so fun. We love our fans, our stadium [and] the atmosphere here,” Swain said. “[The] UCLA rivalry match is one of the most motivating matches in the regular season … I think the girls will bring their best, competitive selves.” 
Earlier this month, the Trojans traveled to the Lone Star State for their first contest against a top-25 opponent. The then-undefeated No. 8 Texas Longhorns revealed themselves to be the Trojans’ adversaries thus far. Texas’ No. 79 ranked sophomore Sabina Zeynalova led the Longhorns’ sweeping 6-1 victory in a straight-set win over USC’s No. 43 ranked redshirt sophomore Snow Han.
Despite the loss, the Trojans returned to California equipped to demonstrate resilience and willpower on the court. USC shut out UC Santa Barbara 7-0 to finish off a month-long stretch of away games.
“We’ve had a pretty long training block in February which has been really nice for us,” Swain said. “The girls have been working really hard, we’ve been focused a lot on our first four shots in singles, in particular, and our serve return, since Texas. I think that helped us against Santa Barbara.”
The Trojans continue to incorporate the lessons learned from the Texas matchup into their future game plans. Swain’s need to “dig in and put scoreboard pressure on the board.” A USC player in the lead must stay focused to extend it, Swain said, and a deficit must “keep the score close and fight for some momentum.”
UCLA experienced a shaky start to the season. In January, they shut out Loyola Marymount yet struggled to win matches in South Florida against No. 4 Iowa State and Florida International. On the West Coast, they encountered a series of canceled matches at UC Berkeley and St. Mary’s. 
Growing pains and lack of courttime are worth noting, but the Bruins will enter Friday with two straight victories and a will to return to their historically successful style of play. 
USC boasts a slew of ITA-ranked players. No. 4 freshman Madison Sieg was recognized as Pac-12 Player of the Week on the home-opening weekend. Since then, she has continued to impress by tallying 7 straight wins and dropping just one set this spring. 
“Everybody needs to be the leader of their court,” Swain said. “Certainly having somebody — like [Sieg] — come in [and] have the success she’s had on her court, in terms of her record, allows everyone else to have a little more confidence.”
USC also has No. 24 ranked senior Eryn Cayetano, another proven leader in this star-studded lineup, No. 111 ranked redshirt sophomore McKenna Koenig and No. 124 ranked freshman Emma Charney. In doubles, the Trojans compete with two top-ranked pairs: No. 19 ranked junior Naomi Cheong and Han and No. 29 ranked Cayento and Sieg.
The Bruins have two ranked players of their own: No. 57 ranked freshman Fangran Tian and No. 64 ranked sophomore Ava Catanzarite. 
Another singles player to look out for is unranked freshman Anne-Christine Lutkemeyer. Lutkemeyer defeated Charney to earn the Singles Title at the Women of Troy Invite. She also earned her first clinching win in the Bruin’s most recent match against CSU Northridge.
In doubles, USC will face UCLA’s most recognizable duo: No. 6  ranked sophomore Kimmi Hance and sophomore Elise Wagle. 
“We feel really good about our doubles play and UCLA has strong doubles too,” Swain said. “The energy and intensity of the doubles play — if we can set a standard there — [will] set the standard for the rest of the match.” 
The USC-UCLA rivalry will continue Monday at 10 a.m. at Marks Stadium.

The NHL trade deadline is looming, with all club-to-club transactions having to be completed by 3 p.m. EST on March 3.
This is the time of the season when teams clear up any confusion about what they’re hoping to achieve. Top teams will usually offload some of their future picks or prospects for guys who can make an immediate impact while bottom-tier squads will do the opposite, positioning themselves to have a more advantageous draft position or increased salary cap space. 
This season’s deadline is even more intriguing than usual, with one prospect being touted as a generational talent and waiting in the wings to be drafted first overall: Connor Bedard. The 17-year-old Canadian sensation is the best prospect since Connor McDavid, who was selected first overall by the Edmonton Oilers in 2015 and has already claimed two league MVP awards.
The phenom has a laundry list of accolades, but one of the most impressive has to be making Team Canada’s roster for the 2022 World Junior Championships as a 16-year-old. To put this accomplishment into perspective, the last two players to make the roster at that age are McDavid in 2014 and Sidney Crosby in 2004. Oh by the way, “The Great One” Wayne Gretzky did it too.
So with all the teams at the bottom of the rankings salivating over the possibility of drafting Bedard, let’s talk about some deals they made to improve their chances.
Rangers acquire Vladimir Tarasenko from the Blues.
Back on Feb. 9, the New York Rangers made a splash by sending forward Sammy Blais, defenseman Hunter Skinner, a 2023 first-rounder and a 2024 fourth-rounder to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for forward Vladimir Tarasenko and defenseman Niko Mikkola. 
The intention of both sides in this deal is clear: The Rangers have their sights set on the Stanley Cup and the Blues have fully entered a rebuild. New York wanted to reinforce their offense with another lethal scorer and Tarasenko provided that spark immediately. The veteran got his first goal in the Ranger Blue just one night after the deal, notching one in New York’s 6-3 win over the Seattle Kraken. 
The 31-year-old is in his 11th season and has surpassed the 30-goal mark in six of those. He also gives some playoff experience to a team looking to make a run in the postseason, as Tarasenko led the Blues to a Championship in a thrilling seven-game series against the Bruins in 2019.
The transaction sets the Blues on a different path, in which they hope to rebuild in order to raise another banner in the future. Tarasenko was the face of the franchise for the last decade and beloved by the fan base. However he is set to be a free agent this summer and St. Louis couldn’t afford to not cash in. 
While the two players joining the Blues are not the most exciting prospects, an extra first-round pick is always valuable and St. Louis was put in a tough bargaining position.
Bruins receive Dmitri Orlov from the Capitals.
More recently, a three-way trade went down between the Boston Bruins, Washington Capitals and Minnesota Wild. The Bruins received defenseman Dmitri Orlov and forward Garnet Hathaway; the Capitals acquired forward Craig Smith, a 2023 first-round pick, a 2024 third-rounder and a 2025 second-rounder; and the Wild got themselves a 2023 fifth-round pick.
Boston is surely all smiles after this deal. The team holding the NHL’s best record was able to fortify their blue line without giving up any of their top prospects. The Bruins are so good that anything short of hoisting the Cup would be a disappointment, especially now that they have improved their chances,boasting arguably the most depth in the NHL at defense. Orlov playing in a crew that already consists of Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm will be a nightmare for opposing offenses.
The Capitals on the other hand, despite still within reach of a playoff spot, announced themselves as sellers and were able to get a solid haul for a player of Orlov’s caliber. The first-rounder this year should allow them to get a promising prospect in this year’s deep class and the 2025 second-rounder could become very valuable as the Bruins’ core is aging.
The Wild played a minor role, getting another draft pick in exchange for taking on 25% of Orlov’s salary.
Those are two blockbusters that pushed existing championship hopefuls a little closer and helped some lesser teams prepare to reload. A key name to watch is Chicago Blackhawks right winger Patrick Kane, with rumors swirling of him heading to New York to join Tarasenko. The future Hall of Famer could very well be dealt by the time you’re reading this, and just know that whoever lands him is getting a stud.

As February draws to a close, Sony fans were met with a livestream packed with exciting announcements for gamers to look forward to in 2023. Thursday’s February 2023 Sony State of Play may not have announced many new titles, but fans were met with new dates and information to look forward to in the anticipated titles to come. Here are some notable highlights from the event. 
PlayStation VR2 will be receiving five new titles
Released on Feb. 22, the PlayStation VR2 was sorely lacking in one thing that makes a console great: games. Though Sony is no stranger to neglecting their consoles in terms of exclusive titles (cough, PS5, cough), they were sure to inform fans of five new games coming to their latest VR experience. 
“The Foglands” is a roguelike first-person shooter game with a charming steampunk aesthetic and is the first new game announced to join the PlayStation VR2. Keeping with the FPS theme, “Synapse,” a title resembling the popular game “SUPERHOT” with a gravity-manipulating twist, and “Journey to Foundation,” another interactive title based on Isaac Asimov’s book series “Foundation,” were both promised to be joining the lineup of VR games. 
In addition to the FPS games, “Green Hell” is coming to PlayStation VR2 with its realistic survival gameplay, now from the PlayStation VR2 point of view. The final game announced for PlayStation VR2 was the award-winning “Before Your Eyes,” a heart-wrenching indie experience in which the player lives through their deceased character’s memories in the blink of an eye. Overall, those who purchased Sony’s newest VR console have plenty to look forward to in 2023.
“Tchia” announces its release date
Though this island-oriented sandbox is mostly shrouded in mystery, “Tchia” has been announced to be released in mid-March. In this new tropical open-world game, players will be given full reign of their experience as they explore the New Caledonia-inspired island. Though the developers have put an emphasis on their realistic physics and laid-back gameplay, there is a story to be uncovered as players take control of the young Tchia in her journey to rescue her father. PlayStation fans can enjoy this new title on March 21 and discover what the island has to offer.
“Goodbye Volcano High,” coming to PS4 and PS5 in June
“Goodbye Volcano High” is an indie cinematic narrative piece, ready to lead the player through its tale of a high school transitional period shrouded in change, melancholy and love. Follow the characters as they find themselves in one of the most uncertain times of their lives: their senior year of high school. With rhythm game elements and an engrossing story, “Goodbye Volcano High” will be joining the PlayStation family June 15. 
“Baldur’s Gate III” will join the PS5 lineup in August 2023
Calling all Dungeons & Dragons fans! The previously assumed PC-exclusive fantasy RPG game “Baldur’s Gate III” is coming to console. The long-anticipated game from Larian Studios is joining the PlayStation 5 lineup, offering a whole new audience of fans the Forgotten Realms experience. In an engaging story of sacrifice, betrayal, friendship and the quest for ultimate power, players determine their own destiny through unique character creation, conquest and crucial decision-making. Fans with a PlayStation 5 can expect to enjoy this long-awaited title on Aug. 31.
“Street Fighter 6” announces new playable characters
As “Street Fighter 6” gears up for its highly-anticipated June 2 release, fans of the series have enjoyed periodical announcements of the characters that will grade their screens in the new installment. In the trailer that played during the State of Play, three characters were announced to be joining the substantial lineup of fighters. Zangief, the iconic massive Russian wrestler, was the first announced, along with the ever-lovable British bombshell Cammy. Both characters hail from previous editions of the “Street Fighter” series, so fans are ecstatic to see their return to the new game. 
In addition to the old faces, a new character named Lily is also joining the fight, a descendant of the Thunderfoot Tribe — the same tribe as T. Hawk, another classic “Street Fighter” character. With all these new characters to look forward to, there is no doubt fans are excited to see “Street Fighter 6” debut on PlayStation consoles in June.

At the end of the action-packed trailer, Capcom also teased a demo soon to come, further hyping up “Resident Evil” fans. Though no date was specified for this demo, one can expect that it’s soon to come given the game is releasing within a month.

When we still lived in the Bay Area, my family and I often went to Half Moon Bay. By age five, when I could remember most things for long enough, the hour-long drive was familiar, almost dreamlike. West through the 580, veering into Route 92, through steep-ledged roads etched into the sides of valleys, past quaint pumpkin patches and Christmas tree farms; and at once the ocean reveals herself — silent and mighty, stretching ever wide over the horizon.
My parents had frequented this spot for dates. That was back in the noughties, when they wore matching chic shades, probably from T.J. Maxx, and when my mother felt young enough to wear her neon peach-red leather coat. Then there was me: The beach at Half Moon Bay was the first one I ever saw after I was born, my mother told me. I’d torn myself out of her and my father’s hands, straight for the roaring ocean, screaming. I was stupid, soaked — but free. As the day grew old and wind cut into our cheeks, we huddled together, mother, father and I, watching the sun slowly sink below the water — and family felt warmer than the heaps of layers we’d worn to prevent exactly this sort of thing. But it didn’t really matter.
Then life came and went, and two years ago — the last time I’d gone — it was just my mother and I, looking over that same sun setting over the laughing couples and the swaying ships and the unspoken deafening absence of the person we’d been forced to leave behind.
But in another way, it felt right to have my mother behind the wheel and myself in the passenger seat, taking the ritual drive to Half Moon Bay, basking in what is and what could have been. In the silence of the car, in the crashing of the waves, in the cawing of the seagulls, there was a feeling that it was just us. It was utopia.
On Jan. 23, a gunman killed seven people in the neighborhood, in two separate shootings, with a legally obtained firearm — allegedly over a $100 repair bill. Somehow, it was one of the less devastating shootings to come out of the news that week.
I felt the urge to text my mother. She’d seen it too. The deaths, the arrests, the thoughts and prayers. Neither of us knew what to say. So we didn’t say anything at all.
As we grow older, our sacred places grow desecrated. At playgrounds, we remember the running and the piercing screams of joy, but we also notice the rust growing on the welding. At beaches, our first concern becomes not the roaring sea in front of us, but the Sisyphian task of finding parking in a gentrified beachfront. As early as in elementary school, we find in classrooms not spaces for learning and growth, but bloodstains, bullet holes and hurriedly censored bookshelves. And for many — Black, Indigenous people and people of color, APIA, LGBTQIA, the “other” in a sea of “us” — innocence was never given to us from the start.
As a journalist, I understood it to be my duty to confront these desecrations day after day after day, and to reveal them to the world. I resorted to devouring the news, convinced that one thing after another was in utter ruin and chaos, horrified at the reality unfolding on my screen but unable to look away. But at some point, I had to force myself to realize: Enough is enough.
I just want to live.
I write because I just want to live. And that means preserving, if not the little sanctity left in the places and the people I love, then the memory of how it used to be or a dream of how it could be. Utopia is not feasible, nor will it ever be feasible, but we might as well try. For at least thousands of years, we’ve depended on a notion of utopia to even survive, to have the strength to press onward. Now is no different.
Over Presidents’ Day weekend, I went again with my mother. We walked, as we always do, to the enormous tree that guards the yawning cliffside. It splits at the roots into two thick branches, each stretching out for a little then giving way to gravity and drooping at the end. It’s always been there, that tree — it’s been there so long there’s a well-trodden path cutting through the split, darting for a bench nearby. I walked the path through the roots; I pressed my hand on the old bark. And I was reminded, again, of the constant in my life that is Half Moon Bay — whose roots are older than memory, but whose leaves still sway and fall and grow anew.

What happens if you build one of the fastest cars in the world then hand the reins over to a twenty-something year old with pride to protect and an innate urge for speed? Find out in the fifth season of Netflix docuseries, “Formula 1: Drive to Survive.” This season, released Feb. 24, follows 10 teams, 20 drivers and cars with top speeds well over 200 mph in the perfect storm of high stakes and bruised egos. This docuseries covers the intense dramatics of Formula 1 through the eyes of the drivers, team principals and racing experts.
Twenty-two rounds of official races around the world took place during the 2022 Formula 1 season. From the lavish street circuit in Monaco to the Abu Dhabi Marina circuit, Formula 1 is not a sport confined to a single space. There are just 20 drivers in all of Formula 1 racing and climbing the ranks to those coveted seats on the grid is a grueling experience. It is a small and selective circle, meaning a driver’s biggest rival might double as their childhood best friend, and one’s teammate is their fiercest competitor. Each pair of teammates across the grid drive cars identical to each other. If one teammate is slower than the other, it is because of their driving, not because their cars are any different. The entertaining intricacies and fragile power dynamic within the sport is what “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” thrives on. The show captures the rise and fall of beloved drivers, and the behind-the-scenes look at the politics of the sport.
The previous season of “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” saw the reigning seven-time World Champion and Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton lose to Red Bull’s Max Verstappen during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. After so many years of Mercedes being five steps ahead of every other competitor, the Red Bull win disrupted the hierarchy of teams. The dominant reign of Red Bull took center stage in season five of “Formula 1: Drive to Survive.” 
The Red Bull team quickly learned that when you take the top spot you also take ownership of the target on your back. With big moments throughout the 2022 season, “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” skipped over the key battle between Ferrari and Red Bull that characterized the start of the season. Once Red Bull had Ferrari in their rearview mirror of the championship race, there was little Ferrari could do to stay in the fight. However, the spar between Charles Leclerc and Verstappen was largely disregarded. For the beginning of the season, Leclerc looked like he was on track to win his first World Championship title. While team strategy and engine failures got the best of his wins, the helplessness of a talented driver stuck in a downward spiraling season was one of the most compelling storylines of the season notably missing from “Formula 1: Drive to Survive.”
The show also spent too much time focusing on the contention between team principals. The fighting between Christian Horner, team principal for Red Bull, and Toto Wolff, team principal for Mercedes, largely felt like a redundant pissing contest, just as it has for the past four seasons. Furthermore, focusing on the politics of the sport such as breaching the budget cap or the porpoising of cars, is not nearly as intriguing as the driving itself. 
Season five of “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” also covered the appropriately nicknamed “silly season” of Formula 1. The time over the summer break is when drivers try to secure their spot on the grid for the next season. The 2022 “silly season” kicked off with the retirement announcement of Sebastian Vettel. Vettel, who is a four-time World Champion and former driver at Red Bull, Ferrari and Aston Martin, announced his departure in July of 2022. The open seat at Aston Martin was filled by Fernando Alonso leaving a spot open at Alpine. Alpine then turned to French driver Pierre Gasly, who had previously been a part of Alpha Tauri. The most shocking turn of events was McLaren signing young Oscar Piastri to be their second driver — essentially kicking veteran Daniel Ricciardo out of Formula 1. Ricciardo spent the remainder of the season scrambling to find a spot on the grid, reverting back to his original team, Red Bull, as their third — or reserve — driver. For 2023, Ricciardo will essentially be a benchwarmer if Verstappen or Sergio Perez can’t race. 
A behind-the-scenes look at the “silly season” in Formula 1 is something “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” adds another layer of depth to. While fans saw this all play out on social media in real time, it is much more dynamic in the show. The show allows viewers to hear the conversations that happened behind closed doors and see the unpolished reactions of drivers before they compose themselves for the press.
Despite the speed and selfishness needed to win, there are moments where there is an accident so bad everything stops. Moments such as the 2022 Silverstone Grand Prix made the roar of each engine disappear and the cheers from fans halted by stunned silence. The Silverstone race, which was covered in “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” was the crash that flipped the car of Zhou Guanyu. The car turned multiple times until he was stuck sideways between two barriers with no way of getting out.
When crashes occur, the drivers no longer care about the name of the car they drive nor their order in the race. It is one of the times so frightening that humanity transcends any competitive spirit and suddenly the millions watching are just hoping the driver in the crash will live. In this case, Guanyu was able to walk out of the car and suffered little to no serious injuries. Retelling this moment highlights the oft-forgotten point that each time a driver steps into their car, there is a possibility that their lives will be taken by a split-second crash. Moments like the Guanyu crash make the “Drive to Survive” title that much more literal. 
Formula 1 is not a sport someone can fully grasp after watching one race, and maybe not even after a full season of the renowned Netflix show. The intricacies of the sport are highlighted in “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” as it portrays how far a driver is willing to go in chasing the checkered flag, answering the question: “How far do they need to drive to survive?”

Once a month I become a crazy bitch (I can say that, you can’t!). Premenstrual syndrome is no secret to anyone with a period, but the ways that we alleviate, approach and talk about it have normalized the impact to one’s physical and mental health. Sadly, this is to be expected.
Over the past few years, I would like to think that the confidence I so strongly held as a child has been reborn and become higher than ever and my coping skills have become more robust. Most of the time, I float through life with a pretty strong ability to withstand any blows or stressors, large or small. However, the one week a month when the hormones that course through my bloodstream prepare to release the home for a child that will not be there, I become nearly unrecognizable — even to myself. My moods become a sin graph on which the peaks have risen but the lows have remained, making those low lows all that more jarring. 
Oh, and the pain. The unbearable cramping has halted my life in one way or another since I was 16. They had a restroom for those on their period at my high school, with heating pads to match. By the time I was a senior, the nurses knew my name. One day during my junior year of high school, I spent a total of 30 minutes at school: 10 trying to withhold myself from vomiting from pain in math class and 20 waiting to be told I could return home to splay out on the couch for eight hours until the pain subsided. Diet and exercise have perhaps helped a little, but, for half of the month, I still pop Advil like candy (at a doctor’s discretion), continually surprised it hasn’t given me an ulcer yet. 
PMS affects up to 75% of the period-having population. Its nastier cousin, PMDD, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder, is a mood disorder that affects 3 to 8% of women. However, anecdotally, whenever this mood disorder is brought up to doctors, they suggest an SSRI to stabilize moods. It seems unnecessary to suggest a mood stabilizer when the instability of the mood is only one week out of a month. Why isn’t there another way? It seems that a mood disorder that can affect half of the population, those with a uterus, is not worth proper assessment. A phenomenon that, at its weakest, afflicts more than 3.9 billion people is met with a shoulder shrug and few recommendations other than to pop more pills, from SSRIs to birth control, that often come with a hoard of additional side effects. 
Female healthcare historically leaves much to be desired. This does not stop with PMS and PMDD. 
Birth control has a laundry list of symptoms or possible detrimental effects, ranging from weight gain and acne to blood clots and increased blood pressure. Many people I know have said they felt like an entirely different person after getting off of birth control. Yet, the most effective non-hormonal, non-invasive form of birth control is a copper-lined wishbone that gets shoved inside you with a pain comparable to childbirth, due to the contraction (loosening of the cervix) that it induces. While men receive local anesthesia for vasectomies, women are often, at most, given a pill to soften their cervix, two Advil and a wish of good luck for IUD insertion. Maybe numbing cream if we’re  lucky. 
This further extends to areas of the body that contribute to female pleasure. Patients with issues in their clitoris are often overlooked due to misogynistic misconceptions of the female body, as “nearly 1 in 4 had clitoral adhesions, which occur when the hood of the clitoris sticks to the glans and can lead to irritation, pain and decreased sexual pleasure,” according to the New York Times. There are countless ads on television for medication to aid with erectile dysfunction. Meanwhile, doctors treat the clitoris as something to be overlooked — something many of us are all too familiar with. 
The lack of options for alleviating PMS and period symptoms is astonishingly low. There is an incredible discrepancy between male and female health care. It is assumed that the female body has an increased tolerance for menstrual pain, due to its frequency. Its frequency, however, does not denounce its inherent crippling discomfort, something seemingly often forgotten. Forgotten, sometimes, even by ourselves, until day 21 finds us back in that painful place once again.

After moving to Hawaii when she was six, Kim Sieberg left many of her childhood memories behind in a small apartment in Franklin, Massachusetts. But between her mom’s immaculate photo albums and nostalgic conversations with her older sister, things start to float back: a dining table, a stuffed rabbit, a box of strawberries.
In her Roski exhibition, “from what can be remembered,” Kim, a junior majoring in art, recalls her childhood home by its spatial form: White yarn wraps around old photos, with Kim’s body cut out to represent the fuzzy differences between the known and unknown. Recreations of home videos are projected onto the walls of the Fine Arts Gallery. Colorful foam letters dot the furniture, bringing a childlike wonder to the exhibition.
“from what can be remembered” started with Kim returning to Massachusetts in 2019 with her family, hoping to feel the connection she had been missing.
“I was like, ‘oh my gosh, I’m going to remember so many things and all these places are going to bring me so many memories and I’ll have like this feeling of being home,’” Kim said. “And that never really happened. I got there and was like, ‘I’ve seen a photo of this place, but it’s not how I remember it feeling.’ And I guess that kind of feeling is what I’m trying to express in my exhibition.”
Most of the concrete memories Kim does have of Massachusetts are with her sister, who is a year and a half older.
“I would basically stick around her and do whatever she was interested in,” Kim said. “She is a creative writer and I’m an artist, so what we used to do as kids was she would write these cute little books and I would do the little illustrations in them.”
While the exhibition focuses on the physical space of the apartment, Kim’s tight knit family dynamic shines through. Kim’s older sister Lauren Sieberg, a graduate student at Chapman University, echoed Kim’s experiences growing up.
“Our family tried to really cultivate the importance of story and creation and art that manifested in the form of creating these silly little stories,” Lauren said. “It was like, ‘You’re my person. You’re gonna do one thing and I’ll do the other.’ There was no other person for it … Why would I choose someone else when I have Kim?”
Lauren, who is earning master’s degrees in English and creative writing, praised Kim for opening up about her family through the exhibition.
“Truly, I am so proud of her, in part because I know it’s very hard to create things focused around topics that are so close to you and so vulnerable and personal,” Lauren said. “Oftentimes those can be the ideas that you want to just lock up tight in your chest and not show anybody, but simultaneously those ideas end up being the things that you really want to explore and work through.”
The white yarn around her photos is reminiscent of Kim’s past projects where she used a technique called punch needling — a method for embroidery that uses tight loops of yarn.
“[Punch needling] is this very repetitive process, and it’s very intentional and time consuming,” Kim said. “It makes me feel a lot of attachment towards what I’m working on, especially if it has these very powerful themes of family.”
Kim wants to mirror the love and care her family has shown her through her yarn work.
“My family has truly been there through everything, from heartbreak to falling down the stairs and injuring my knee,” Kim said. “There’s this quality to yarn where you have to work really hard to make it into a form that you want, but also there’s still this fragile nature to it that is really interesting.”
Roski Arts Photo Laboratory Technician Jon Wingo noted that the multimedia aspects of “from what can be remembered” play to Kim’s strengths.
“Kim’s a fantastic artist and she’s multidisciplinary,” Wingo said. “A lot of her illustration work is pretty awesome. You can see the back of her computer has a lot of her own design work of really cute illustrations and stickers, but also Kim’s a great photographer … When I think of her work, I think of primarily her last photographic project that she did last semester where she was doing self portraiture where she was using a mechanical camera, lighting it herself and performing in front of the camera at the same time, which is incredibly difficult.”
Kim hopes that “from what can be remembered” proves that home can be found anywhere, as long as you’re surrounded by the people you love.
“The exhibition is like this grand love letter to how I was raised, and all the sacrifices and memories and the way that I grew up,” Kim said. “Most of those memories that were made in that apartment in the end are because of my family and with my family.” 
“from what can be remembered” is available for viewing until Mar. 8 at the Roski Fine Arts Gallery.
