USC wide receiver Brice Butler, who originally planned to transfer following the spring semester, will stay at USC, the school announced Monday.
“We are pleased with Brice’s decision to continue his development as a student-athlete at USC,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said in a statement.
Butler, who announced his intention to transfer via Twitter on Jan. 26, did not participate in spring practice despite remaining in school.
Coming to USC as a highly touted four-star recruit, according to Rivals.com, Butler, caught just nine passes for 112 yards and one touchdown as a sophomore in 2010, playing behind fellow receivers Brandon Carswell, Ronald Johnson and Robert Woods.
He will be forced to compete with returners De’Von Flournoy Kyle Prater, Carswell and Woods, as well as incoming freshmen Victor Blackwell and George Farmer for playing time.
