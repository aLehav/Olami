This week, like many of the past seven weeks, I went to class, I went to work, I had a few cups of coffees in between (Coffee Bean #regrets), and I asked myself what the meaning of my life was. Looking back a few episodes in this telenovela I call my life, I was celebrating my new job dressing the stars. I thought I had finally made it. But then the question hit me that besides the paycheck that I was getting out of it and the allure that working with famous people had, what was really calling me to this career?
While I continued to have a one-on-one Oprah-level intervention with myself, I realized that perhaps it was the pressure to “have my life together” (and an Instagram-worthy one at that) that drove me to want to be in such a glamorous industry. Now, I want to be clear; I am not coming for anyone that works in the limelight. I wouldn’t be working towards a degree in entertainment public relations if it wasn’t something that I was passionate about. No tea, no shade, just lemonade. *snaps fingers in a “Z” formation*
It’s just that when I really looked into my future, I didn’t want to come to the end and have people’s main remarks at my funeral be, “Wow, that chick really knew how to slay an outfit” or “That girl, her bank account was poppin’.” I want people to remember me for all the causes that I care about, for all the compassion and kindness I carry in my heart, and for the lives I touch. I want people to see my life for the quality of the picture, not the quantity of likes. But in order for others to see that, I have to first start seeing what matters through that lens. 
I think every student – especially all us seniors out here – has experienced a sort of “young life” crisis at some point. It could be something as little as dealing with your first C in a class to something like switching your major late in the game, or maybe going through a more personal hardship. If you’re anything like me, you may have already experienced multiple. Lucky us. 
I think the honest truth is that all of us 18 to 22-year-old people going through this process we call “higher education” come out a little different than we came in. Of course there is the $60,000 per year worth of “perspective and knowledge” we gain, but I also think we all are forced to come face-to-face with worry like never before in our lives. 
It was just last year when I learned what a W4 was, opened a savings account, and really started asking myself what I wanted to do for the rest of my life that would A) bring me some semblance of joy and B) bring me some food, clothes, and shelter. And in the mix of all that worry and questioning, I think I got a little too caught up in the latter like I’m sure many of us do. 
So to get to the somewhat drawn-out point now, don’t let that fear of having a life that just looks good on paper make you settle for something that doesn’t feel good – something that doesn’t fulfill your soul, your passions, your true values. Queue corny yet inspirational statement: Wouldn’t you rather find those answers now than live with the regret that you never had the courage to even question it later?

The prosecution rested its case Friday in the trial of Alejandra Guerrero, who has been charged with the murder of USC graduate student Xinran Ji. 
Jurors heard several rounds of testimony, starting with a forensic expert who confirmed that red stains found on a baseball bat believed to be the murder weapon were a perfect match for the victim’s blood. Mei Ling Cabral Robinson, who works for the Los Angeles Police Department’s Forensic Science Division, also testified that bloodstains found on a pair of jeans worn by Guerrero the night of the murder matched Ji’s DNA profile. 
DNA from the handle of the bat, however, turned up inconclusive results due to a lack of testable evidence. 
Prosecutors also presented screenshots of Guerrero’s Facebook messages leading up to the night of the murder, which were retrieved with a search warrant. The messages specifically referenced “flocking,” a term that Guerrero used to describe robbing, and established a motive for Ji’s murder. Guerrero admitted to LAPD detectives that the group she was with that night was driving around looking for someone to “flock,” according to the Los Angeles Times. 
The Facebook testimony had been redacted due to several objections from the defense, which claimed that the full transcript of the messages contained a “racial overtone that would inflame the jury’s passions” and unfairly bias jurors against Guerrero. Language such as the word “n—-r” was removed, as well as references to previous altercations that Guerrero had had. 
Ji, an engineering student from China, was killed in July 2014 while walking to his off-campus apartment. Three others are also charged with the homicide, but Jonathan DelCarmen, Alberto Ochoa and Andrew Garcia will be tried separately from Guerrero. 
The trial will resume Tuesday morning, when the defense will present its case to the jury. 
This article is part of an ongoing series covering Guerrero’s trial. You can find previous reporting from the Daily Trojan here and here.

A student was robbed at gunpoint in the early hours of Friday morning on the 1200 block of West Adams Boulevard, approximately a mile off-campus near the north end of Ellendale Place and Ralph’s grocery store.
The victim arrived home alone just after 2 a.m. when a man and a woman approached her as she was walking up to the front gate of her house. A USC Uber had dropped the student off just a few houses down on Magnolia and Adams Boulevard.
The pair, who were crouching behind a car near the house as the student arrived, drew a gun and demanded any cash on her person.
“It looked like they were just waiting for someone to come down the street,” the victim said, who asked to remain anonymous because the robbery was at her personal residence.
When she told them she didn’t have any cash, they then made her walk with them to three different ATM machines at gas stations along Vermont Avenue. They went up to Washington Boulevard and Vermont, just under a mile from the initial robbery point.  The couple eventually escaped with $400 in cash from the student’s account.
The Los Angeles Police Department and the Department of Public Safety are currently investigating the incident, and no one has been detained in relation to the crime, according to DPS. They are in the process of reviewing nearby security footage.
The victim described the pair as being in a relationship and wearing all black. Both were in their early 20’s. The 1st suspect was described as a 5’10,” thin black male with braces. The 2nd suspect was 5’3”, black female of average weight with her hair in a bun.
DPS said the robbery is not believed to be related to a string of robberies that occurred last weekend on both the 3000th block of Figueroa Street and 28th Street. In those incidents, a group of four men physically assaulted and robbed two students, attempted to rob a third and physical assaulted a fourth.
Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article contained the victim’s name. After publication, she decided she no longer wanted her name in the piece because of privacy reasons.

During my first week at USC, several things made me reaffirm my admiration for this university. Firstly, I was was in awe by students’ ability to avoid collisions while rushing to class, regardless of their choice of transportation: skateboard, bike, or even hoverboard. I can’t even text and chew gum at the same time without walking into a plant (which happened to me yesterday), so I truly do not understand how an entire campus mobilizes on wheels.  
Secondly, I think it’s cool how we have a cupcake vending machine. Like seriously. That thing is worthy of a Nobel Prize. 
Lastly, and most importantly, I found that the people at USC are remarkable. When I was meeting new people in my first week, I always enjoyed the surprised looks I received from strangers when I told them that I am from Russia. The conversation was always the same: they asked me where I’m from, I say I’m from Moscow, their eyes widen, and then they ask me how I learned my English. I would explain that I was born in Los Angeles, but I moved back to Moscow when I was seven where I attended an English-speaking, international school. 
I recognize that the questions that follow my brief introduction are what I value most in my interactions with USC students. Oftentimes people would ask me about my stance on the political and social situation in Russia. Someone might want to hear my opinion on the Russian arts. As a comparative literature major, this question makes me do a little dance, as I get to go on a ridiculously long tangent about how awesome Russian literature is. (To those of you who have asked me about the arts, I apologize if I accidentally put you to sleep).
These questions signify to me the type of open-minded characters I get to share the halls with.  When I am approached with a question, my respect for the person who asks drastically increases. I appreciate people’s needs to satisfy their cultural curiosity. Our world is so rich and vast that there is no possible way for a single human being to absorb the knowledge, traditions, cuisines, etc. of every single community that prevails on this planet. For this reason, I profoundly see the need to keep asking questions. 
I also feel that by asking questions, I get to break certain unpleasant stereotypes about my country. Yes, Russia has a drinking age, and no, children are not breastfed vodka. 
Questions allow me to give a more accurate portrayal of where I come from and who I am. I admire that USC students have proven to be a curious bunch.
Elizabeth Kirillova is a freshman majoring in comparative literature.

A short-list of musicians trending as we officially enter fall.
Courtesy of Caroline Feda
SHELLS – The London beauty recently released her third single “Jailbird,” celebrating female inner strength. Her lyrics are exceptionally potent which proves that the single is more than just another throw away pop song. These are combined with catchy production, that will have you leaving the song on repeat. With an EP on the horizon, SHELLS is someone you want to keep on your radar.

Moses Sumney – The R&B/Folk/Pop singer has been trending in the blogosphere for the past year, however just recently it seems he has been hitting his stride. His new track “Lonely World” reveals the the complex dimensions of his music. In this song, he transforms a quiet lullaby into a kaleidoscope of bass and synth, creating a musical metaphor for loneliness. For more new music, Sumney’s EP “Lamentations” is now available on iTunes.

Jerry Folk – Hailing from Oslo, Norway, the 19-year-old producer/DJ has developed a significant fan base on SoundCloud from his infectious remixes of hits by Chromeo, Oh Wonder, and ZZ Ward. However, recently Folk has been topping the charts with original material such as his latest song, “Life Under Water.” The track exemplifies his ability to blend indie, electronic, and R&B to create an entirely new sound that we will hopefully be getting more of in coming months.

Daya – After dropping her latest single “Cool,” the 17-year-old singer songwriter has fans old and new eager for the release of her debut album Sit Still, Look Pretty. However, until its arrival on October 7th, this catchy preview is sure to satisfy. The song shows that Daya has begun to stray from the bubblegum pop music that launched to her to fame and delving into more complex emotional themes. The production on her new single is equally mature and is sure to attract an older audience.

Bishop Briggs – The songstress that brought you the Spring/Summer hit “River” is back with new material. Her new single “Be Your Love” is filled with haunting vocals and a catchy drum track that are reminiscent of her previous hit, but transforms into its own unique sound. Her ability to blend dark and upbeat sounds has allowed Briggs to accumulate a number of hit singles over her career. Hopefully, this latest release is a hint at an upcoming album so be on the lookout this fall.

Senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers is having a stellar campaign thus far, ranking second on the team with 19 receptions. The Daily Trojan sat down with him to talk about his life, football and other random factoids.
Q: How do you feel about playing your final games in the Coliseum as a senior?
A: I feel good. I’m ready to go out and showcase for my last time.
Q: What’s the mood been like in the locker room after a disappointing start to the season?
A: Basically the guys are more focused and ready to play. We just have a chip on our shoulder right now and we are trying to do the best we can for Coach Helton and the team.
Q: You’ve learned from some great receivers such as Marqise Lee and Nelson Agholor. Now that you’re a senior, how do you view your role as a leader?
A: Basically just teaching the young guys, because once we leave, it’s up to them. It’s their team and they gotta come out and represent USC and do it the way we did it.
Q: You’ve played under three head coaches in four years. Do you feel like the program is finally in a place of stability as you prepare to exit?
A: Yeah I can say that. Coach Helton is a great guy, great coach and a player’s coach. Everyone loves him: players, fans and it takes time to get a program rolling. I feel like right now we are still trying to put together the pieces of the puzzle, and once we get it all rolling, everything is going to be great.
Q: What has it been like having to adjust to a new philosophy nearly every year of your career? 
A: It’s been a challenge, but it shows you that I can adjust to any system. It’s a lot of hard work going under three head coaches and basically trying to learn each playbook, but once I get the concept down, it becomes easy. It’s the same thing as playing anywhere else; you just have to work hard and focus on what you gotta do, and everything falls into place.
Q: As a receiver how do you feel about the switch from Max Browne to Sam Darnold?
A: Max Browne is a great player and a great guy. Sam Darnold is too. It wasn’t my decision; it was the coach’s decision. But I feel like we gotta do what’s best for the team, and you know Sam Darnold has done a great job.
Q: You’re currently in the midst of your best statistical year. What’s been the key to your play this season?
A: Just going out and having more fun. Not thinking so much. My last year, not going out there and thinking about what’s next, just living in the moment every time and just focusing game by game. Just enjoying the moment, because these are moments I can never get back, so I just go out there and try not to think about it too much and just play my game.
Q: What did it mean for you to attend USC and play the last four years close to your hometown (Compton, CA)?
A: It means a lot. I feel like I would be doing something wrong if I didn’t come to my hometown school. Playing for USC is a blessing for me and my family. It’s close to home, so my family can come to all my games, because probably once I leave USC, ain’t no telling where I’m gonna go from there. It’s an honor to play at this school, all of the traditions and things like that. I take it very seriously.
Q: Speaking of your hometown, what was your environment like growing up?
A: Not so much of the nice neighborhoods, a lot of gangs going on. It was up to me to choose my path. And I chose to go to school, go to class and get good grades so that I could come to a four-year college, get a degree and hopefully get my family out of here and go somewhere where everything is more happy and things are better.
Q: Who were the people that influenced you to follow that path?
A: My mom, my dad, a couple of my uncles and my siblings. I just try to do it for them. My sister has her degree from Fresno State, and I’m trying to follow in her footsteps. I’d be the second one in my family to get their degree. It’s just something my mom preaches a lot to us, and she’s very happy for me.
Q: How has your upbringing influenced you as both a person and a player?
A: I just try to keep a positive vibe all the time, a great attitude. I feel thankful that I’m here everyday: to go to school, to play football for USC and to be around great people like my teammates. Stay out of trouble and things like that. Take advantage of it everyday, and I just thank God that I’m still alive and doing something that I love to do.
Q: Looking back, what’s been your favorite memory as a Trojan?
A: I would have to say catching the Hail Mary pass my sophomore year in the Coliseum against Oregon State. Catching a Hail Mary is something that doesn’t happen very often, and me being able to say I caught one in the Coliseum is something that I can keep forever. It was just an amazing moment. Plus we won the game. I was just stoked that that happened. A lot of people can’t say they’ve caught a Hail Mary in the Coliseum.

Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanSun’s out · An Environmental Core member holds up a sign near Tommy Trojan to protest the administration’s response to their Go Solar campaign.
Several dozen students gathered at Tommy Trojan Thursday afternoon to demand that USC do more to generate solar power on campus. Students brandished signs with slogans like “I’m disappointed, USC” and “10% solar NOW” while circling Hahn Plaza and chanting in unison. 
The rally, which was organized by the Environmental Core under the USC Program Board’s Environmental Student Assembly, was the fourth hosted by the club in the last 12 months. The ESA aids the University’s environmental student groups in promoting sustainable living at USC, and one facet of its programming is the USC Go Solar campaign, which included Thursday’s rally. 
Ethan Bialick, who co-directed the Environmental Core before graduating from USC last year, founded the campaign in 2014 with the goal of making USC generate 10 percent of its electricity from solar panels. The club organized three rallies at USC regarding this issue last year, and was able to get 150 signatures on a petition demanding the installation of solar panels on campus.
Zachary Manta, director of the Environmental Core and sustainability advisor to the Undergraduate Student Government, said that he sees the lack of solar energy use on campus as a serious issue.
“This campus, which has 292 days of the sun in a year, doesn’t have any form of on-campus solar generation,” Manta said. “We at USC contribute around 55,000 tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year through our tremendous energy usage.”
Manta said that people are doing very little to mitigate the generation of carbon dioxide through electricity use and are not doing enough to generate energy that is renewable and carbon-free. The Environmental Core has approached solar companies and consultants to develop proposals for installing solar panels on the Galen Center. According to Manta, however, for many years the administration was unresponsive to the club’s requests. 
“We have had a lot of difficulties getting any sort of meetings with the administration, with the energy director or any statement from President Nikias regarding this,” Manta said.
USC announced its Sustainability 2020 plan in November 2015, which provided a framework toward creating a more sustainable school. The plan aims to provide long-term, cost-effective solutions for issues such as water conservation and diversion of waste at USC, which will ultimately reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve energy. However, Manta said that it does not do enough to address the issue of solar energy specifically.
“We think it ought to be a lot more ambitious when we think about solar generation on campus,” Manta said.
Sarah Berry, an undeclared sophomore and leader of the Go Solar campaign, said that her personal background drove her to join the Environmental Core freshman year in order to create change on campus, which she said can’t happen without the help of the administration.
“Coming from the Midwest, I thought California would have a bunch of environmental groups, but I was kind of struck by the fact that there wasn’t much going on at USC, especially at the administrative level,” Berry said.
Berry said that the research the Environmental Core brought to USC from places like Solar City solar consultants has not been heard, and their proposals have been rejected. This was the reason club members started organizing the solar rallies. 
“We want USC to follow the Sustainability 2020 plan and start implementing it,” Berry said.
This strategy might be working. Manta said that administrators at USC are starting to pay attention to the rallies, supporting the Environmental Core’s initiative and considering moving forward with USC’s energy projects.
“We got a lot of emails and a lot of phone calls,” Manta said. “The administrators are seeing that there are students willing [to take on] this initiative, and it is not purely their energy or financial decision.”
Emily Wan, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience who attended the rally, said that she appreciated the efforts of the Environmental Core and thought they will be effective in creating change. Wan signed the petition for the Go Solar campaign and encouraged students to get involved in making a difference.
“I think that a lot of resources are being wasted in the United States,” Wan said. “We need to speak up, and the club is doing a great job at that.”
Part of the problem may be that USC gets its power from the LADWP. The LADWP doesn’t offer net metering to anyone.
Since the costs for solar installations have become more affordable due to the lower manufacturing costs of the equipment, “Tax incentives” and other monetary gains, the main factor limiting solar power to be viable option for a many building owners the amount of available roof top space to produce enough kilowatts for the project to have a reasonable ROI.

Photo courtesy of Hollie BowersTo the rescue · Hollie Bowers says that she acted on instinct to help the victim of an accident. She will be honored for her actions on Friday.
On Jan. 5, 2015, Hollie Bowers was driving home from school on State Route 91 when she spotted a driver who appeared to be drunk coming up behind her. Just as she began to dial 911, she had to swerve into another lane to avoid being hit. 
A few moments later, she watched as the driver hit a motorcyclist and sent him flying into the air. Bowers slammed on her brakes to avoid running the man over. 
Rather than continuing to drive or simply being a witness, Bowers decided to assist the man until the paramedics arrived. 
Bowers’ actions that day earned her the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Courageous Citizen Award, which District Attorney Jackie Lacey presents to her in a ceremony later today. 
Bowers, a senior majoring in public relations, is among four Southern California residents to be honored for their acts of selflessness this year, who are nominated by deputy district attorneys and selected by a committee. 
“Ms. Bowers was chosen for her immediate response to someone in need,” said Sarah Ardalani, a public information officer for the DA’s office. “She remained with the victim during the whole incident, was willing to testify in court and served as a support for the victim’s wife from the time of the crime to the sentencing hearing.”
For Bowers, however, her actions that day were not motivated by a desire to appear heroic. 
“[Helping him] was my first instinct,” Bowers said. “I didn’t think twice about it. My first instinct was to be with him and talk to him because I wouldn’t want to be alone.” 
When the motorcyclist, Jerry Frey, was hit, Bowers ran to him and started asking him questions to keep him awake until the paramedics arrived. She called his wife to inform her of the accident and to ask questions about his insurance.
“I told him over and over that I would not leave him,” Bowers said. “I held his hand and he squeezed mine out of pain.” 
When the paramedics arrived, Bowers made sure to stay with Frey until he was taken to the hospital. 
However, 17 days after the accident, Frey passed away — a fact that Bowers said was difficult to process.
“Hearing that he passed away made my heart ache for his family,” Bowers said, “[The award] is bittersweet but it is an honor.”
Bianca McCovy, Bowers’ boss at Icon Plaza, said that Bowers exhibits courage not just in high-profile cases such as the accident that she witnessed, but in her everyday life.
“When she found a resident passed out in an elevator room, Hollie immediately contacted the proper authorities and stayed with the resident until the authorities arrived,” McCovy said. “The resident later stated how glad she was that Hollie had acted so quickly and calmly during that situation. Hollie is a person that our residents and staff count on to do the right thing.”
Despite these assessments by those who know her, however, Bowers continued to insist that she was simply doing what was necessary — but that now, she places a greater value on the meaning of courage when making decisions.
“I never thought about what I did as courageous,” Bowers said. “I thought it was just something that should be done. Reflecting on this award and what it means in my life, I think it has redefined the word ‘courage’ for me and made it something that is of huge value.”
Great story, better person.  Proud she is a Trojan.

Alexandra Ting | Daily TrojanA series of fortunate events · Students work out the “mind-body connection” at a Mental Health Awareness Month event on Oct. 3.
A series of events this month will focus on making students more aware of how prevalent mental illnesses are on college campuses and providing guidance to students in need of mental health support.
Mental Health Awareness Month, hosted by the USC Academic Culture Assembly throughout the month of October, started last year and has returned in 2016 after generating positive feedback from the student body. 
“The theme for this year is self-care and community care, because we are trying to advocate our students to take care of themselves and to take care of the community as well,” said Luis Vidalon-Suzuki, executive director of the Academic Culture Assembly.
Vidalon-Suzuki said that Mental Health Awareness Month intends to spark conversations among students through a series of seminars and student workshops. The Academic Culture Assembly  plans to host a mental health resource fair on Halloween, and has created a mental health resource guide for students to utilize when considering the issue on campus.
“Before this, there was not a centralized location where students could go to for mental health resources,” Vidalon-Suzuki said. “This guide informs students who are in need of help. We [also] passed a resolution through the USG Senate to require those mental health resources to be on all course syllabi.”
While the Academic Culture Assembly is the main host of the program, it is collaborating with other organizations and assemblies to provide more diverse events to students. 
For example, the Asian Pacific American Student Services and International Student Assembly are teaming up to provide a workshop in which students can make their own personal stress balls. Furthermore, the Health Sciences Education Program is hosting an event, “Slam Down the Stigmas,” in which students do slam poetry regarding mental health issues and the stigma surrounding them.
“We find that students have a very high rate of depression and other forms of mental health illnesses,” Vidalon-Suzuki said. “The fact that we don’t talk about them or the resources are underfunded is a problem. We want to tackle these issues with different perspectives, which is why we collaborated with other assemblies and program boards.”
Vidalon-Suzuki said he hoped that by bringing these taboo subjects into a public forum for discussion, students would actively be involved in conversations about how to combat mental illnesses. 
To start off these conversations, the Academic Culture Assembly invited acclaimed poet Rupi Kaur to campus for a live reading and book signing on Sept. 29. 
Kaur’s poetry tackles difficult topics including destruction and healing, and her empowering message parallels the lessons that the Academic Culture Assembly hopes to teach students this month. 
Students, however, expressed both positive responses and concerns. Alex Luu, a junior majoring in animation and digital arts, said that he agreed with the concept of the programming series but did not think Rupi Kaur was a good choice as a program opener. 
“Kaur did bring light to some issues that aren’t normally talked about,” Luu said. “However, I feel her poetry … fails to address the ‘bigger picture,’ the ‘why’ she is doing her work.”
Nash Iyer, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, said that he liked the more creative format of the programs offered this month, and hoped that other students would take something away from these events that they can use in their everyday lives. 
“This program is a good step in the right direction, because a lot of times words that describe mental illnesses are used as derogatory terms to mean bad or stupid,” Iyer said. “But we definitely need more ways to spread awareness, because most people aren’t super motivated to come to talks.”
—mental health issues and the stigma surrounding them—
You would be amazed how many colleges and universities tolerate voicing that prejudice. It is a frightening number to say the least.

Active shooter incidents have been rising in frequency for the past 15 years, according to a recent FBI report, culminating in 23 college campus shootings in 2015. 
However, the Associated Press found that active shooter training remains inconsistent in college campuses. In the aftermath of the June murder-suicide on UCLA’s campus, Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Austin Dunn is working on implementing active shooter training for students at USC. 
Dunn hopes to create an interactive online program that all incoming freshmen would undergo, similar to AlcoholEDU. The move comes in response to conversations Dunn had with UCLA students following the campus shooting that left a professor dead.
“There were even students who kept their composure who were at a loss for what to do,” Dunn said. “It might seem like common sense, but in times of crisis, sometimes you lose that. I think with something like this, this allows us to provide students with at least an idea of options for what to do.”
The current Safety Training page of the DPS website consists of a video titled “Run. Hide. Fight.” The video, by the Ready Houston program, simulates an active shooter event, featuring graphic imagery of people screaming and being gunned down.
“It’s very in-your-face and abrasive,” Dunn said of the video. “I can’t use this particular company, because that’s super triggering, and we have to think of students’ mental health.”
The video cautions people to prepare a plan in case of an active shooter, to escape if possible, hide if evacuation is not possible and confront the shooter only as a last resort.
“The latter half of that video is actually super educational and helps you put in perspective the options you have in a situation like that, so it’s something that students don’t naturally think about on their own, and it’s something we want to put in their minds,” Dunn said.
In order to instill these principles in students, however, Dunn said he recognizes that any training must be sensitive to students’ mental health.
“Although I think that is effective in some ways, I did realize that I have to take in consideration, as brutal as this may seem, there are students on our campus that are already at risk, and we don’t want this training simultaneously serving in a way that it might be putting the idea of becoming an active shooter in some students’ heads,” Dunn said. “When there’s 19,000 students, I’m unaware of where everybody is at mentally.”
As of now, additional training provided by DPS beyond the video is focused on faculty and staff. In the hour-long presentation, DPS officers go over various safety apps and discuss previous violent situations that have occurred on campus. No further training is available for students, but DPS is working on reformatting that training to be accessible to students through Trojans Alert. 
“As the UCLA shooting came up, and then the Orlando shooting came up, there was more of an uptick of requests for this training,” DPS Training Coordinator Sgt. Pablo Ayala said. “In regards to the administration, I know they’re open, and they want the student body to be safe. That’s their priority, and that’s been expressed to me on several occasions. President Nikias is a real proponent of safety, and whatever he can do to keep this campus safe, he’s going to do.”
Dunn and Ayala have discussed the issue together from various angles, including student safety, mental health and student need, to identify potential obstacles to implementation. 
Dunn plans to receive feedback from student leaders when he introduces the resolution for active shooter training at next week’s USG Senate meeting.

A USC professor is among 22 finalists for the National Book Award for his work chronicling the effects of the Vietnam War. 
Viet Thanh Nguyen, an associate professor of English and American studies and ethnicity at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction this year for his debut novel The Sympathizer, which explores Vietnamese American identity in the wake of the war. 
However, his nominated piece for the National Book award, Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War, is a work of nonfiction. 
In this piece, Nguyen recounts the stories of American and Vietnamese people who were impacted by the war, but doesn’t limit himself to just these two sides — he also writes about Laotians, Cambodians, South Koreans and Southeast Asian-Americans.
Nguyen, who was born in Vietnam but raised in the United States during the war between the two countries, writes about the experiences of people living on opposing sides of the conflict. 
According to The New York Times, Nguyen called Nothing Ever Dies a nonfiction companion to The Sympathizer. 
The National Book Award is administered each year in four categories: fiction, nonfiction, poetry and young people’s literature. 
Winners, who will be announced on Nov. 16 in New York City, receive a prize of $10,000.
