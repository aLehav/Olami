The USC men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams begin their seasons this weekend with high expectations.
The men finished last season tied for seventh in the country, while the women finished in fifth place. The Trojans are led by senior Jack Ostler and junior Alex Lendrum, both of whom were among the Pac-10’s best in their events last season. The Women of Troy, meanwhile, are led by captain seniors Katinka Hosszu, Amanda Smith and Victoria Ishimatsu, all of whom were All-Americans last season. Hosszu, who was the NCAA Swimmer of the Year last season, took home three individual titles at last season’s NCAA championships.
Sophomore Vladimir Morozov set the USC record in the 50-meter freestyle last season as a freshman and looks to be one of the top 100-meter backstroke swimmers in the Pac-12. Also returning to the team is senior Jeff Daniels, who along with Morozov helped obtain the fastest 200-meter freestyle relay in school history. The men won three titles at the Pac-10 championships last season. In total, six school records were set last season, and this season could provide more.
On the women’s side, 18 upperclassmen return to one of the nation’s elite squads. Led by Hosszu, Smith, and Ishimatsu, the Women of Troy broke 12 school records in 2010. Hosszu was an All American in five different events and won several medals in the European Short Course Championships. Smith, a transfer from the University of Indiana, looks to set personal bests in the 200-yard freestyle and 1650-yard freestyle, among other events.
The men open against a CSU Bakersfield team that has quite a few stars of their own. Led by Peter Bardessono, the squad boasts seven swimmers who rank in the top 25 in their respective events. The Trojans, meanwhile, return 15 upperclassman to a squad that finished the season ranked in the top 10 in the country.
The women open up against Washington State, a team that went 6-2 last season outside of major tournaments but finished near the bottom at the Pac-10 championships. They return Anne Kenney and Kelsey Bruggman, both of whom had strong showings at the conference tournament.
The men’s swimming and diving team has not won a national title since 1977, when it won four in a row. They have won nine championships overall. The women’s team has one title to its credit that it won in 1997.

For the USC women’s soccer team, its darkest days might be gone just in time for the squad’s final home stand of the season.
The Women of Troy, fresh off their first Pac-12 victory of the season at Washington, return home to take on Arizona State and Arizona this weekend at McAllister Field, in what will be the final games several members of the team will play on their home turf.
Last hurrah · Senior defender Ashley Freyer looks to lead USC to its first home victory of the year in the last homestand of her career. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan
“For us seniors, we’ve wanted to win all season,” senior forward/defender Ashley Freyer said. “For a lot of us, this is the last time we’re going to play competitive soccer in front of families and fans. We want to win and put everything out on the field. We’d love to end it all on a good note.”
USC will celebrate Senior Day on Sunday against the Wildcats — a festivity that will likely be made more enjoyable by a victory Friday afternoon against the Sun Devils.
“We won last week, but this is a whole different week,” Freyer said. “We’ve got to prepare for Friday and take care of business then before we worry about anything else.”
Like USC, both Arizona State and Arizona have undergone some growing pains in 2011. The Sun Devils are 2-4 in the Pac-12, and the Wildcats enter the weekend tied with the Women of Troy with just one conference victory apiece.
“We can’t focus on other team’s records, really,” Schloemer said. “It’s just about us. We haven’t played up to our expectations either, so we’re just going to come out and play whoever we face as tough as we can.”
Players also insist last weekend’s victory has loosened the team in time for the home stretch of the regular season.
“It’s a big relief to get that first one out of the way,” Freyer said. “It came way later than we expected, but we finally got some bounces to go our way and it turned out well for us.
Schloemer added that improvement has already been evident in the wake of the slump-busting win.
“We celebrated like we’d won the World Cup when we beat [Washington],” Schloemer said. “Because of that weight being gone, we have a lot of confidence going into this weekend’s games. We had probably one of the best Tuesday-Wednesday practices that we’ve had all season, which is very promising.”
USC can still finish with a winning record in the Pac-12 if the team wins its final five games, beginning with Arizona State and Arizona this weekend. Of USC’s five remaining opponents, only two have a winning record.
The Women of Troy take on Arizona State on Friday at 3 p.m. and Arizona at 1 p.m. on Sunday for Senior Day and Fan Appreciation Day.

After one go-round through the gauntlet of the Pac-12, the Women of Troy are alone atop the conference standings.
The No. 3 USC women’s volleyball team (15-3, 10-1) has recovered from a loss to then-No. 8 UCLA in its conference opener at Galen Center, stringing together 10 consecutive wins — the first time since its national championship season in 2003.
That feat is even more impressive as Pac-12 teams occupy five of the top seven spots in the American Volleyball Coaches Association poll.

“We couldn’t have started the first half [of conference play] any worse, and we couldn’t have finished it any better,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “When you have six matches on the road in the first half and you’re able to win all six, that’s a very big deal.”
Entering the second half of conference play, USC understands it must not look ahead to its final game of the season just yet against UCLA in Westwood.
“I think you have to take [matches] one at a time, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say we circled the last game against UCLA,” Haley said. “We’d like to give a much better effort [next time].”
Haley, however, has remained even-keeled.
“All of our matches are important, of course,” Haley said.  “All of them will serve as a challenge for our team to get better for [the NCAA tournament].”
This weekend, the Women of Troy will kick off the second half of conference play against Utah and Colorado, both of which are unranked.
But at this point, USC isn’t taking any opponent lightly.
“We’re making sure that our focus is on [every match] because we don’t want to relax in any way,” senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter said. “We have a lot of things we can still improve on.”
The Utes (8-12, 3-8) and Buffaloes (5-14, 0-11) will be looking for revenge this weekend after they were swept by USC on their respective home courts in their first matchup this season.
“This is the second half, and it’s a little bit more difficult because those teams are going to be a little bit more confident,” Haley said. “Every team is going to give their very best effort against us now.”
Utah has won two of its past four games, a sign of hope for a team that seems to have struggled adjusting to the competitive nature of Pac-12 volleyball in its first year in the conference.
But the Utes do seem to have a statistical advantage in their middle defense. The Utes are third in the conference with 3.04 blocks per set, while the Women of Troy are averaging just 1.98, which ranks ninth in the conference.
“We’re doing some different things on defense now,” Haley said. “We’re not really smooth at the transition part of that yet, so we’re trying to see if we can clean that up.”
The Buffs are still looking for their first conference win, as they rank at the bottom of the conference in nearly every statistical category.
“Colorado wasn’t at full strength when we played them last time,” Haley said. “I think they’ll be better this time.”
The Buffs are led by outside hitter Kerra Schroeder, who ranks seventh in the Pac-12 with 4.06 kills per set.
Even though this weekend’s matches might not be the most highly anticipated contests left on their schedule, the Women of Troy realize every game counts the same in the standings.
“Every team is going to get so much better in the second half,” Jupiter said. “We have to make sure that we do the same.”

For now, a sense of normalcy has returned for the No. 2 USC men’s water polo.
Following a narrow 9-8 win at then-No. 2 California on Saturday, the Trojans climbed from No. 4 to No. 2 in the polls.
Riding a three-game winning streak, USC (12-2, 3-0) hopes to continue its upward climb as it faces No. 5 UC Santa Barbara at McDonald’s Swim Stadium at noon Sunday.

“It’s good to move up in the ranks for sure,” senior goalie Joel Dennerley said. “We would like to be number one, but at this point in the season it doesn’t matter; we just hope to be there by the end of the year.”
This game will be the first time the Gauchos (12-6, 0-1) face the Trojans this season. The two teams, however, are familiar foes. USC has a 59-12-2 all-time record against UC Santa Barbara and has won the last 41 games against the Gauchos, including three wins last season by scores of 7-6, 13-9 and 10-2.
Regardless of the winning streak, the Trojans insist they’re not overlooking anyone.
“From past experience, they’re a tough team,” Dennerley said. “They have some dangerous lefties who are pretty good shooters, they have a pretty good goalie and a couple of experienced shooters. At their pool they are going to be fired up to play us and they are going to take it to us in every area so we need to be ready.”
Though it is keeping an eye on the competition, USC has proven to be a tough team to beat this season in its own right. The Trojans have outscored its opponents 171-65 and hold the top defensive record in the conference with an average of 4.6 goals-against per game.
“We’d like the defensive end to keep it below four goals a game,” Dennerley said. “A few of the tough games we give up more goals and that’s not ideal. Offensively, we are producing solid amounts of goals and we hope to continue that throughout the season.”
Now three games removed from their two back-to-back losses in the SoCal tournament, the Trojans have had time to improve and build back their confidence.
“We played with a good amount of excitement and we played a team game [against Cal],” senior driver Peter Kurzeka said. “We have two losses and all these other teams have three, so I think we are in a good place.”
The victory against Cal, which won sophomore driver Jeremy Davie his first MPSF Player of the Week honors, proved valuable in keeping the Trojans’ momentum alive.
“[Winning MPSF Player of the Week] was pretty cool, I haven’t done that before,” Davie said. “I’m pretty honored with it, especially after the caliber of players on our team that have won it before. To be recognized with them is pretty sweet.”
With the harrowing victory against the Golden Bears behind them, the Trojans will face off against the Gauchos, looking to improve upon their newly formed three-game winning streak and reach the top of the rankings once again.
“We showed great desire towards the end of game against Cal to seal a victory, so hopefully the boys continue that on Sunday,” Dennerley said.

Six years ago, No. 9 Notre Dame hosted No. 1 USC in one of the most memorable contests in recent college football memory — a game remembered simply as the “Bush Push.”
Though the Irish fell in a heartbreaking 34-31 defeat, many viewed the game as evidence of Notre Dame’s imminent return to football prominence. First-year Irish coach Charlie Weis seemed to have the program rapidly moving in the right direction and, with the departure of quarterback Matt Leinart and tailback Reggie Bush after the 2005 season and USC coach Pete Carroll’s continued flirtation with the NFL, the end of a tumultuous four-game losing streak to USC was in sight.
Well, not exactly.
Carroll delayed the inevitable departure four more years until 2010 when Weis was also ousted, signaling the end of a period of Irish befuddlement in the form of an eight-game losing streak with a 24.5-point average margin of defeat.
Just a few months later, USC was placed on probation, banned from bowl appearances for two years and, most importantly, stripped of 20 scholarships over a two-year period.
Under Irish coach Brian Kelly and Trojans coach Lane Kiffin, a new chapter of the rivalry is unfolding, as the two will be inextricably connected throughout their respective tenures.
Kelly won the first battle between the two, a gritty 20-16 Irish victory that snapped eight years of turmoil and returned the Jeweled Shillelagh to Notre Dame for the first time since the Bob Davie era.
Detractors are quick to point out the Trojans were without their starting quarterback and right tackle in the 20-16 loss. Notre Dame, however, was even thinner in numbers, with a freshman backup quarterback, and backups at running back, tight end, nose guard and linebacker.
Lost in the argument amid all the injuries is the important point that Kelly and defensive coordinator Bob Diaco bamboozled a talented Trojan offense and its coach, who was hired more for his ability to out-scheme a defense than for his previous track record, which includes a 5-15 mark with the Oakland Raiders and a 7-6 slate in his only season with the University of Tennessee.
The 16 Trojan points were the direct result of four Tommy Rees turnovers in Notre Dame territory. Despite an average starting field position at the 23-yard line following the four turnovers, the Irish defense surrendered only three field goals and a touchdown.
The Notre Dame-USC battle is always a barometer used to determine where each program stands, and last year’s Irish victory suggests a shift in momentum in the rivalry.
With a gargantuan opportunity in this year’s contest, Saturday marks the biggest game for Notre Dame since that fateful October day six years ago. Only this time, the program is much closer to returning to elite status than it was in 2005.
Despite consecutive losses to begin this season, Kelly’s plan is working. Players are becoming more comfortable in his system and his recruiting, specifically on the defensive side, has provided this year’s unit with depth, not to mention present and future playmakers.
While USC is hampered by a scholarship limit, Notre Dame has had the opportunity to reel in its second consecutive top-10 class, and this weekend will go a long way toward attaining that goal, as the Irish host 17 elite prospects on official visits and many more on unofficial visits.
What happens if Notre Dame loses?
Well, the rest of the college football world will roll its proverbial eyes and quip that it’s simply another false alarm on the “Return to Glory” claim. Some prospects might not buy into the plan Kelly is preaching.
And if the Irish win?
The Trojan fan base becomes further disgruntled with Kiffin’s performance, Notre Dame’s slim BCS hopes become a bit less slim, and a crop of the most talented high school prospects in the country, many of whom are USC targets, get a front-row seat in an electric atmosphere to the continuation of a new streak in the storied rivalry.
 
Andrew Owens is the associate sports editor for the Notre Dame Observer. 
I remember listening to the 1966 game on a shortwave radio in Turkey – I was in the service. ND won  51-0, and legend has it that after the game the SC coach (I can’t remember his name) said “I’ll never lose to that Armenian bastard (Parseghian) again.”  And he didn’t. The next year he showed up in South Bend with O.J. Simpson. I’ve never seen the like before or since. 27-7 if memory serves. 
Undergraduate humor – a sign that said “Trojans won’t last a period.”

Unless I’ve been sleeping under a rock for the last decade, the question of who still holds a grasp on the coveted “Jeweled Shillelagh” heading into USC and Notre Dame’s prime time showdown tomorrow night, requires little to no thought: USC.
There’s no bias here or jaded sense of entitlement, the numbers, the wins, the undeniable dominance speaks for itself. Slice it and dice it anyway you’d like, aside from a rain-soaked 20-16 victory that required more than one fortuitous bounce — a wide open Ronald Johnson dropping what would have been a go-ahead touchdown in the final minutes or starting quarterback Matt Barkley sidelined for the only time in collegiate career because of a knee injury — the Fighting Irish haven’t even been playing on the same field as the Trojans since about the end of the Clinton administration.
Harsh as that might be, heading into last year’s literal and figurative Turkey drop at the Coliseum, USC held an eight-game win streak over Notre Dame. And outside of the historic “Bush Push” in 2005, most of those contests were decided before the bands even took the field for their halftime performances.
Look no further than the 44-13 snoozer of 2002, Matt Leinart’s  41-10 pre-Heisman coronation in 2004, the 38-0 Mark Sanchez coming out party in 2007 and the 38-3 Thanksgiving laugher in 2008.
I know statistics don’t always tell the story, but a margin of 24.5 points per game during that span doesn’t require a lifeline for explanation.
One win does not suddenly shift the balance of power in the swinging pendulum that defines this rivalry.
Joe Montana’s green jersey heroics in 1977 didn’t wash away the Trojans’ eight wins from 1974-1982, nor did USC’s 1996 victory suddenly alleviate the damage left by Notre Dame during the previous 11 years. So, why is this current quandary any different?
There is no denying the job Brian Kelly has done in his second year at the helm of the Fighting Irish program. He has quickly restored the crown jewel of the university, which was a mighty task given the lack of life support his predecessors Charlie Weis and Tyrone Willingham provided the program.
But, perhaps the more important question is not who has the bigger fingerprint smudge on the rivalry keep sake, but what this game means for two schools caught between the crossroads of what was and what currently is.
Aside from South Bend hosting a night game for the first time since Lou Holtz was calling plays on the Notre Dame sidelines, this game has a rare air about it none of us have felt for some time.
For a rivalry that began on Dec. 4, 1926 thanks to the chatty wives of USC Athletic Director Gwynn Wilson and famed Irish coach Knute Rockne, the annual matchup stretching more than 2,000 miles has sadly gone from riveting to mundane in the last handful of years.
From NCAA sanctions to coaching changes to unfulfilled expectations, two of the country’s powerhouse programs have been reduced to national afterthoughts in recent years.
Forgotten nowadays are historic chapters like Rod Sherman’s remarkable catch to help the Trojans knock off a No. 1 Irish team in 1964, or the unprecedented ties of 1936 and 1968, or the 24-point comeback by USC at the Coliseum in 1974 en route to a 55-24 victory or Irish kicker John Carney’s game-winning field goal as time expired in the closest game ever between the two in 1986.
Though these moments have been forever etched in the lore that holds this rivalry together, the battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh these days has been overshadowed by off-the-field drama and on-the-field disappointments.
Both schools can play the “I’m better” routine until their fan bases go red in the face, but the real joy should come in knowing the rivalry as we once knew it is back tomorrow night because slowly but surely both programs are making strides in the right direction at the same time.
That isn’t to say what we will witness on the foot-high grass Saturday night are two teams battling for national supremacy. Both teams still have plenty of issues to address, from Tommy Rees’ growing pains to the tailback carousel currently taking place in USC’s backfield.
So, on the surface it’s a standard nonconference matchup between fringe top 25 teams, but for those who have witnessed the highest of highs and lowest of lows in this storied rivalry, 2011 serves as the resurrection point. With a nationally televised performance highlighted by pro prospects Robert Woods, Matt Barkley, Michael Floyd and Manti Te’o, there is no debate that the pride of this historic series will certainly be on display this weekend.
It’s the kind of clash, Pat Haden, Lynn Swann, Howard Jones, Frank Leahy, Paul Hornung, Joe Theisman and Tim Brown would all sit back and smile about.
So let me rephrase my opening thought. We all are the real winners from this year’s USC-Notre Dame rivalry game.
Whether you bleed blue and gold or cardinal and gold, the real jewel trophy we all can get our hands on, is a rivalry restored.

Yes, USC was without Mat Barkley and Tyron Smith last year, and ND beat them with all of their key players healthy. Oh wait, except Dayne Crist, Armando Allen, Kyle Rudolph, and Theo Riddick, just those guys though. 
 So both teams had inexperienced quarterbacks playing in that game. Oh wait, USC had a 5th year senior who was the consensus #1 QB recruit in the country in 2006 in Mitch Mustain, and ND had a true freshman making his third ever start in Tommy Rees.
Then again, if Ronald Johnson caught that pass USC would have won. Well if Harrison Smith hadn’t slipped and fallen down it might have been intercepted. Can you really say which part of that play is more of a fluke?  
And Te’o’s hit on Marc Tyler earlier in that possession was a fumble, not an incomplete pass.
I agree with your well written article.  This rivalry is about so much more than football supremacy.  It is a game with GREAT history, equally GREAT players and fans, two GREAT bands, and the kind of color that is unmatched in college football.  There are many great rivalries, but few with the rich history of this match-up.  Here’s to another great game!!!  GO IRISH!!
Don’t worry about foot-high grass.  The consensus is that ND is now the more talented team.  If anything, we want the field to play faster, not slower.  Bring it.
Good piece. The fact that neither team is currently a factor on the national scene is not important. 
Notre Dame v. Southern California is just as important as Southern California v. Notre Dame. 
May it be cold and windy and rainy and may the warriors leave their hearts on the field and may their uniforms be muddy and a little bloody and may they all remember tomorrow night and may all the potential recruits at the game leave the stadium stunned at what they have seen and heard.
Liked the spirit of the article, I think it will be a great game. Go Irish!
Well, Trojans, it’s that time again.  Players, it is time to kiss your mamas goodbye, lie to your girlfriends, and check your weapons.  It’s USC against Notre Dame.

Junior tailback Curtis McNeal remembers growing up, watching some of USC’s biggest players — Reggie Bush, Matt Leinart, Mike Williams — play in what was arguably college football’s greatest rivalry.
Bounce back · Junior defensive end Nick Perry (pictured here last year against Notre Dame) and the USC defense will look to slow down Notre Dame quarterback Tommy Rees and wide receiver Michael Floyd on Saturday. Last year, despite losing, the Trojans held the Fighting Irish to 20 points at home. - Daily Trojan file photo
One day, he dreamed of doing the same.
“You always want to play on the biggest stage,” McNeal said. “And this is one of the biggest stages that college football has to offer. I’m excited and looking forward to it.”
The USC-Notre Dame rivalry stretches back to 1926 and the teams will square off for 83rd time Saturday night in South Bend, Ind. For just the 10th time in the history, however, neither the Trojans nor the Fighting Irish are ranked in the Associated Press top-25.
The buildup to the meeting might not have the same flair as it did four years ago, but the matchup has not deterred the players one bit from focusing on the task at hand.
“Because it’s Notre Dame, there will be a lot of hype surrounding it,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “[But] we’re ready, we’re prepared and we’re focused.”
And USC will need to be focused.
Notre Dame enters on a four-game winning streak after dropping its first two contests of the season to South Florida and Michigan. In their four wins, the Fighting Irish have averaged almost 36 points per contest, limiting opponents to just 17 points per game.
Defensively, Notre Dame features junior linebacker Manti Te’o, one of the top linebackers in the country. Te’o, who USC heavily recruited in 2009, leads the Fighting Irish defense with 59 tackles and four sacks. Along with Te’o, cornerbacks Robert Blanton and Gary Gray anchor a secondary that has six interceptions on the season.
“Notre Dame is a very good team,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley said. “They’re very talented on defense. They have an experienced group of seniors who know what they’re doing.”
Though Notre Dame’s defense boasts a veteran group, USC’s offense, led by Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, average 30 points per game and almost 431 yards per contest. The play of freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee has given the Trojans another weapon on the perimeter besides Woods.
Lee did suffer a shoulder injury last Thursday at California and was forced to leave the game in the second quarter. Nonetheless, the Inglewood, Calif., native plans to play. Lee’s injury isn’t the only USC health concern, as senior tailback Marc Tyler dislocated his left shoulder against Cal. Tyler, however, practiced this week and stated earlier he is willing to play even if he reinjures his shoulder. The coaching staff, however, has its hesitations.
“It says a lot about Marc to make that statement,” Kiffin said. “It says a lot about his dedication to this program with all that he’s been through. But it’s our job as coaches to make sure that we’re doing it in the best interest for the whole season.”
Should Tyler not be able to go, McNeal would likely get the starting nod with freshman tailback George Farmer getting more carries than usual as well.
“I was a little nervous in my first game, but I feel I’m a little bit more comfortable now,” said Farmer, who ran the ball four times for four yards against Cal. “Coming into Notre Dame, I’m ready to do a little bit more than last week.”
On the other side of the ball, the Trojans’ defense is also hurting. Redshirt freshman cornerback Anthony Brown broke his ankle last week against Cal and was ruled out for the season and sophomore cornerback Torin Harris is still recovering from a shoulder injury. With the secondary in shambles, junior cornerback Isiah Wiley, a junior college transfer, could get the start opposite Robey.
Wiley played significant snaps for the first time last week against the Golden Bears, but despite his inexperience, Robey believes he’s ready.
“I’m excited to see what’s going to happen,” Robey said. “He’s been working hard and doing all the right things to go out on Saturday to [do well].”
The defense, which forced five turnovers against Cal, will have its hands full trying to slow down Notre Dame’s quarterback-wide receiver combination of Tommy Rees and Michael Floyd. Rees has thrown for more than 1500 yards and 14 touchdowns, while Floyd has notched 639 yards receiving and four touchdowns this season.
“They have great chemistry between each other,” Robey said. “Floyd is a great athlete — an NFL receiver. I’m expecting to see a little bit of everything from him. Rees is a great player and you got to give respect to him. I know they’re ready.”
With the hype that surrounds two of the most storied programs in college football history, the coaching staff understands it cannot let such a young, inexperienced team get distracted.
“I think because of our age and because we’re so young, the last thing you want to do is build it up too much,” Kiffin said. “It comes down to playing well and not adding too much pressure.”
Even the players understand it comes down to the game and not the speculation and media attention off the field.
“We need to match Notre Dame’s intensity, outplay them and outhustle them,” Robey said. “They’re a good team. They’re fundamentally sound. But at the end of the day, it’ll come down to who wants it more.”
Kickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. and the game will be televised on NBC.
 
GO IRISH! BEAT TROJANS!
Hope everyone has a safe trip to South Bend and has a great time, but I want everyone at USC going home disappointed. Go Irish!

Andrew Pritikin received his degree in physical therapy from USC in 2008, after working several years as a self defense instructor, office manager and industrial salesman. He now serves as clinical director of the Bauerfeind Performance Center in Santa Monica, which works with a variety of professional athletes and will work in the Olympic Village for the London 2012 Games.
On Saturday, he will speak at the first Youth Summit for the Foundation for Second Chances, a non-profit organization devoted to helping underserved children. The Youth Summit, which will be held at USC, was created to inspire Los Angeles area high school students to actively plan for their futures.
 
Daily Trojan: What are you going to talk about at the Youth Summit?
Andrew Pritikin: We’re going to  be speaking to kids who are interested in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, who play sports and who are interested in doing physical therapy as a profession. We’re going to talk about basic types of injuries that they see on television at college games. We’ll explain what happened to the injured athletes.
 
DT: Why are you reaching out to these children?
Pritikin: I used to teach a sports injury class at Santa Monica Community College. Then I was able to reach the kids at a level when they were in their decision-making process of what they wanted to do. The step beyond that is to help other kids at a high school level and let them know there is a profession out there that allows them to work with sports at a high level.
 
DT: What do you most remember from your time at USC?
Pritikin: It was a lot of work, but just knowing that I was at the No. 1 school in the country gave me the assurance that I was learning for the best by the best. One professor, Dr. Cheryl Resnik, taught a professional development class that focused on how important it was to have ethics of equally high standards as the manual skill I was learning.
 
DT: What are you really proud of?
Pritikin: I work with a lot of professional [mixed martial arts] fighters, so the therapy I do with them is very intense. I’m happy to say that I make a number of them whimper. When you put those guys in pain, you know you’re doing something right.
 
DT: What kind of technology do you use in your line of work?
Pritikin: We use sports motion analysis. High speed video cameras at multiple angles are used to biomechanically access athletes’ motion to find the defects and compensations. This has been around for a good number of years. Something else we’re using now that’s more advanced is what’s called the MediLogic system. It is a wireless insole system where we have the athletes either walk, run or move in a lateral motion. We’re able to get pressure readings on each insole to see exactly how they’re landing, what their foot is doing, how it’s moving and the proper custom insoles that are needed for that particular athlete. It’s wireless so there’s nothing that encumbers them, so they can do their natural motion without any issue.
 
DT: What kind of clients do you see?
Pritikin: I am working with some 14-year-old swimmers who are looking forward to going to the Olympics in five years. I’m working with tennis pros who want to go to the Olympics next year. I’m working with the US Olympic Committee, going to explain what we do here because this company will be working in London. I’m lucky to work with the US Olympic Committee where this company will be, inside the Olympic Village at the London Games.
 
DT: What will you do at the London Olympics?
Pritikin: I get to run the PolyClinics — a clinic for all the countries that need treatment. Whatever comes up, you’ll treat it. It’s great. I’m a sports physical therapist, and it’s truly the most you can really do. Next to working with professional athletes every day — the Olympics is really the biggest thing you can do. It’s great. I’m very excited.

Since sixth grade, Leanne Gutierrez, a sophomore majoring in public relations, has been drinking coffee to stay up to do homework. She now drinks three to four cups each day. Were coffee prices to rise, Gutierrez said she would feel the effects.

“[Price increases] would really affect me, especially since I’m a student,” Gutierrez said. “I have a limited income.”
This situation could quickly become a reality, as experts and big corporations, including Starbucks, warn that climate change and other factors pose a significant threat to the supply of coffee and chocolate, a trend already leading some companies to raise prices.
“There are changes in climate, but also in [land distribution] and drought trends,” said Roger Clemens, a former USC professor and chief scientific officer at ET Horn, a distributor of raw materials and ingredients.
In response to declining production, several supermarket coffee companies, including Maxwell House and Folgers, increased prices by more than 25 percent between 2010 and 2011.
Many students said they would not alter their coffee drinking habits as a result of raised prices.
“I personally don’t think it would affect me,” said Tiffany Chang, a senior majoring in biological sciences. “If I had to pay more, I’d still drink it because I need coffee.”
Another threat to coffee beans is a disease killing insects that pollinate the crop, Clemens said.
“We call it colony collapse,” he said. “If you don’t have the insect population, you can’t get the plants pollinated.”
Another highly demanded product, chocolate, might become much more expensive, according to a report from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. According to the report, the supply of cocoa could plummet because of rising temperatures in West Africa.
As many would with coffee, students would continue to find ways to eat chocolate in the case of a shortage or price hike.
“I wouldn’t eat less chocolate,” said Emily Frank, a sophomore majoring in business. “I love chocolate.”
With population expected to increase from 7 billion to 9 billion in the next 30 years, countries will have to consider the trade-offs between producing coffee and essential food items, Clemens said.
“You will see a tremendous change in agriculture and coffee is one of those crops that is going to change,” Clemens said. “Do you want to grow coffee, or do you want to grow lettuce or fruits, or the foods that can actually supply nutrition?”
The correlation between climate and a 25 percent increase in coffee prices is unfounded.  A better conclusion lies in the profit margin for big business.  Let’s not fool ourselves.
An interesting thought about the how the climatic change is having an effect on coffee production.  The consequences to the coffee farmers could affect them substantially.  I’m pleased that many are prepared to accept the higher price, as that will continue to help the coffee farmers for the time being.

At least 20 students plan to take part in the Occupy Los Angeles protest on Saturday.
Navtej Singh, director of special projects for College Democrats, is organizing a group to attend the rally. He said at least 15 students attended the rally with him last Saturday.

“College Democrats isn’t sponsoring the event in particular, but we wanted people to give people a way to attend,” Singh said.
College Democrats also plans to hold an Occupy USC rally in front of Tommy Trojan Monday at noon.
Alexandra Howland, a junior majoring in international relations and fine arts, said she has taken an active role in the movement because she was taken with the cause.
“The cause is always something I’ve always been very passionate about, but had not really known that it was a real tangible thing that people were talking about,” Howland said. “I’ve always been sort of an activist, always been very outspoken in political issues.”
College Democrats Membership Director Alex Van Roekel attended an Occupy L.A. rally Saturday with fellow club members.
“There were nine or 10 of us,” said Van Roekel, a junior majoring in political science and economics. “We just decided to check it out and show our support.”
While some students attend the protests to bring attention to the cause, Howland is doing more. She focuses on sustainable living teaching at the protests so protestors can stay for extended periods of time by helping to start gardens to grow food.
“The occupation itself is a sort of a claim of land,” Howland said. “We’re here, we want change. We’re not going anywhere — we’re setting up for months.”
Howland also works to help educate protesters. She brought professors from other universities to the protests to educate people about the reasons behind the movement.
Howland credits her International Relations classes for giving her background information on the movement, but was motivated by political ideals.
“My IR classes have definitely helped me know the factual side of things, like the federal reserve,” Howland said. “IR has definitely helped, but it isn’t the reason why I’m doing this — it’s just something I’m passionate about.”
The Occupy Wall Street movement, which began Sept. 17 in New York City, lead to the Occupy L.A. movement and other protests and rallies in major cities around country and world.
Occupy Wall Street’s website says the movement is “fighting back against the corrosive power of major banks and multinational corporations over the democratic process, and the role of Wall Street in creating an economic collapse that has caused the greatest recession in generations.”
“[Protesters in the Occupy movement want to] make people uncomfortable and to let them know we’re here, and what’s happening is not acceptable,” Howland said. “We’re no longer accepting how they’re treating us and what they’re turning our country into.”
Howland said the issues the movement addresses are especially relevant to students.
“It affects us more than anyone,” Howland said. “Students these days are graduating with an equivalent of a mortgage in debt, and there are no jobs for them when they graduate. Our generation is so apathetic about everything, which is one of our biggest downfalls, and this is finally an opportunity to end that and our false consciousness about what’s going on.”
The movement leaders have said Occupy protests are non-partisan, although many recognize it has predominately liberal ideals and goals.
“In a way, it’s a liberal response to the Tea Party,” Van Roekel said. “It’s just people tired of not getting their fair share.”
A desire for an ongoing movement has kept Howland from starting an “Occupy USC,” she said. Howland said she was interested in seeing a committed, long-term group of protesters.
“A lot of times, especially in L.A., things tend to be a trend. I don’t want like the Woodstock experience,” Howland said. “It sort of feels like Woodstock, but it’s a global revolution.”
Some find the Occupy movement protesters to be meritless because they lack demands, but Howland said demands can often restrict this type of protest.
“We’re not [making] demands because creating demands and a list of things is asking someone with greater authority to change for us,” Howland said. “Of course there’s always going to be a governmental leader, but there needs to be a sort of equality [in the process].”
Participants, however, are quick to recognize that, without demands, the movement will not be able to sustain itself.
“It’s definitely a hindrance to not have any specific demands, but in a way, it’s why it became a worldwide movement,” Van Roekel said. “Eventually it’s going to need to start filing itself down.”
For now, Howland has no intention of giving up anytime soon.
“[Students] are so apathetic and so unaware, and some people are just thinking about new technology or what’s happening over the weekend, or football games.” Howland said. “It’s such a big movement and to not be a part of it is such a waste.”
Occupy Wall Street is one of the most ridiculous protest movements in American history. Seriously – go on youtube right now and look at some of the interviews people have done with the OWS protesters – the message is completely incoherent. Their phrase “we are the 99%” is actually quite apt because 99% of these activists don’t have the slightest clue what they are even protesting.
This “occupy” protest is quite misguided.  The financial services industry can only function according tot the rules voted on by your Congress.  If you dont like the banking system then you should be protesting in front of the Capitol Building.  Congress passed the laws that allowed the financial meltdown tomhappen, and greedy folks who could not afford the home they were purchasing want a bailout.  When will you folks realize that government should not bail you out because of your poor  decision making?  Why arent you folks protesting in front of the White House?  Our President has done a terrible job so far.  Spent ,ore money than all Presidents combined and wants to spend more.  Where is the money going to come from?  It doesn’t grow on trees.
I know that there is an urge of young people to join a cause that is greater than themselves, but is the “Occupy” cause greater than the individual students? Is the point of the protesters bigger than USC? Thus far the “Occupy” events are populated with a wide variety of people with very different goals, but they all have one thing in common – free time. For USC students there are many on campus and off campus activities that area a better use of time.

The USC cross-country team looks to follow up last week’s impressive second place at the Titan Invitational on the Cal State Fullerton campus, the last non-championship race of the season this weekend.
The 5k race will begin at 5:00 p.m. today on the Cal State Fullerton campus. This is the first night race this season, as the majority of collegiate races are run in the mornings. Seven USC athletes will run this weekend: Francesca Adamski, Shelby Buckley, Anna Burger, Austin Lundin, Jessica Lundin, Erin Matranga and Kelly Owen. This race, however, will serve mainly as a tune-up before the Pac-12 championships, which are scheduled for Oct. 29 in Tempe, Ariz.
“Our goal is to keep improving and stay healthy during these last few weeks of the season,” USC coach Tom Walsh said. “The freshmen have done a great job of pacing themselves through this season.”
Last week’s performance at the Northridge Invitational was a well-deserved boost in the team’s morale, with USC placing second overall and freshman Erica Capellino taking third among the competitors. She was followed by Shelby Buckley in 11th place, Erin Robinson and Kira Soderstrom in 19th and 20th, respectively, Katie DeYoung in 22nd and Jaclyn Walles, Shannon Byrne, and Kelly Owen in 27th, 29th and 33rd. Austin Lundin placed 52nd, while Erin Matranga, Jessica Lundin and Anna Burger came in 58th, 63rd and 87th, respectively.
“I was very pleased that our fifth runner finished the race ahead of everyone else’s fifth runner. Erica Capellino led the way with a strong effort in her first 6k race as a [Woman of Troy],” Walsh said. “I thought Erin Robinson, Kira Soderstrom and Katie DeYoung all pushed hard in the middle of the race, and really battled against the other runners around them. This helped us close the gap between our first and fifth runner, which is very important in a cross country race.”
Last week’s performance at the Northridge Invitational might be a good predictor of the team’s potential at the Pac-12 championships, as both are 6k races. The distance is a problem for many schools, as collegiate cross-country races are typically five kilometers in length. USC’s runners, however, tend to perform well at longer distances.
Walsh said that after careful consideration of last week’s race, as well as overall performance, the seven girls who will run in the Pac-12 championships are Shelby Buckley, Shannon Byrne, Erica Capellino, Katie DeYoung, Erin Robinson, Kira Soderstrom and Jackie Walles. Five of the seven girls selected for the championship race are freshman, but Walsh believes the young team will be an advantage in the long run.
“This is a positive because they will gain the necessary experience to eventually score well in the conference championships,” Walsh said. “I [won’t say anything else] other than that USC will come and run our best race of the season in Tempe.”

The USC women’s golf team, still seeking its first tournament victory, concludes the fall season this weekend as it participates in the Pac-12/SEC Challenge in Knoxville, Tenn., starting today through Sunday.
After notching an eighth-place finish in the Fall Mason Rudolph Preview to begin the season, the Women of Troy recorded a sixth place finish in last weekend’s Stanford Intercollegiate at Palo Alto, Calif.
The team has seen up and down performances from its starting five, as consistency has been difficult to achieve. After starting strong and faltering down the stretch in the Fall Preview, the Women of Troy maintained a steadier pace during the Stanford tournament, reaching a high position of fourth place before concluding at sixth.
The Women of Troy finished the tournament with a final score of even par 852, ten strokes behind the Bruins. Senior Lisa McCloskey led all USC players, finishing tied for 10th at 2-under 211. Sophomore Rachel Morris improved consistently throughout the three rounds, placing 16th at even 213. Freshman Doris Chen, who notched an impressive 4-under 67 in her first round, finished tied for 20th at 1-over 214 in her debut tournament, along with senior Inah Park. Highly touted freshman Kristen Park recorded the best scores among all USC players and finished tied for 4th at 6-under 207, but played as an individual and hence did not see her scores count toward the team’s total.
While the quick turnaround already makes this tournament a challenge for the Women of Troy, the team is additionally beset by the absence of star sophomore Sophia Popov, who injured her wrist and bowed out of the tournament on Saturday. USC coach Andrea Gaston confirmed that Popov’s injury is a case of tendinitis, and she did not travel with the team to Knoxville.
While the Women of Troy, who won four tournaments en route to another top-five NCAA finish last year, have not yet fulfilled their lofty expectations, Gaston has stressed the need to be optimistic and focused.
“Obviously, finishing eighth and sixth are not the results we wanted, and we know that there are certain aspects of the game that require improvement,” Gaston said. “However, the potential and talent level of the players are very high, and it’s just a matter of time before we pull through and start playing up to our expectations.”
Additionally, Gaston placed a particular emphasis on the presence of freshmen Chen and Kristen Park, both of whom have posted strong performances throughout the first two tournaments.
“We have two very, very good freshmen on our team,” Gaston said. “This situation is especially harder for them because the transition to college life is never easy, and being members of the team only adds to that challenge. Despite that, we’ve seen what they’re capable of, and all of the players will have considerable time to work on their individual games for the spring.”
Following the SEC Challenge, the Women of Troy will enjoy a long break before beginning the spring season with the 2012 Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge, held in Palos Verdes, Calif. in mid-February.

The Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s Southwest Regional Championships kicked off on Thursday in San Diego, Calif. in what is shaping up to be an action-packed event featuring 81 participants in the women’s singles bracket and 39 teams in the women’s doubles bracket. Six Women of Troy are competing in the tournament, which runs through Oct. 23.
Junior Danielle Lao is the defending singles champion and entered the tournament as the top overall seed. She remains undaunted, however, by the prospect of attempting to repeat as singles champion.
“The only pressure here is to really just go out and compete well,” Lao said.
Lao isn’t the only ranked player from USC in the singles bracket. Sophomore Kaitlyn Christian is the No. 5 seed, freshman Zoe Scandalis is No. 10 seed and senior Alison Ramos is the No. 13 seed. Freshmen Gabrielle DeSimone and Sabrina Santamaria round out the participants for the Women of Troy. USC coach Richard Gallien offered some sound advice for each member of his team.
“You just want to keep getting better at competing,” Gallien said. “It’s always easy to say we want to get better in the running game or you want to get better in the passing game, but the object for us is to continue to become better and more consistent competitors.”
In the doubles bracket, Christian and Santamaria are ranked as No. 2 duo, Ramos and Scandalis are the No. 9 seed, and Lao is teamed up with DeSimone as the No. 12 seed. Ramos was part of the championship-winning tandem in last year’s event, but Valeria Pulido, her partner in 2010, is currently playing in the Pan-American games. Ramos, however, remains confident in her new partner’s abilities.
“I feel really comfortable with [Scandalis],” Ramos said. “Our games really compliment each other. Zoe is an awesome doubles player so we’ll see [what happens].”
As for her outlook on the singles bracket, Ramos is eager to improve on her finish in the 2010 Southwest Regionals.
“I feel like I’ve improved a lot mentally and physically,” Ramos said. “I’m in much better shape than I was last year. I’m more focused, and excited to play.”
All six members of the Women of Troy will be careful not to underestimate any of their opponents. To make a run at a title, however, Gallien knows who USC’s toughest challengers will likely be.
“It usually comes down to us and UCLA,” Gallien said. “Arizona State has an excellent team. Arizona is much improved. I think it’s going to be a nasty weekend with a lot of upsets.”
The three freshmen in the field — Scandalis, DeSimone and Santamaria — are looking to successfully navigate through their second tournament as members of the USC tennis team.
Coach Gallien has been impressed with the group of newcomers thus far, and understands the learning curve they face while growing accustomed to a new level of competition.
“[The freshmen] are used to winning from their junior tennis days,” Gallien said. “They look at this as the next step in their own success. They’re taking it in stride. For the first time, as a college freshmen, you’re playing in tournaments where you might play somebody who is four years older than you are.”
As for his expectations for the entire Women of Troy team at the Southwest Regional Championships, Gallien has a goal in mind.
“If we’re able to get someone into the finals in singles or doubles, that would be a very good finish,” Gallien said.

Fans had waited for months. Then, on Oct. 11, it happened — the cinematic event of the month. Marvel released the teaser trailer for The Avengers. Directed by Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly), The Avengers features Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow joining forces to fight evil. Though the film does not come out until May 2012, fans’ imaginations have been running wild since Iron Man domestically raked in more than $318 million this year.
The Avengers has been in the works since 2008, and Marvel has taken an unconventional approach to creating the film. All of the heroes, besides Hawk Eye and Black Widow, have had their own movies — Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger came out this summer.
If you stayed through the credits for the movies, you might recall a series of kickers that involved Samuel L. Jackson appearing to say something cryptic and badass. Or in the case of Thor, the not-so-dead villain Loki gets psyched about the Cosmic Cube (the most powerful artifact in the Marvel universe). For those unfamiliar with the source material, Jackson’s character is Nick Fury, an ageless spymaster. He’s also crossed multiple high-grossing franchises to bring our heroes together for one epic battle. The financial cost of this strategy is momentous — Marvel puts a lot of stock and money in America’s love of superheroes.
Since Batman and Superman were brought to life in the late ’30s, superheroes have dug their way into pop culture and all forms of entertainment. Even more so, they have ingrained themselves in the American psyche.
Mythology pervades virtually all cultures. The Greeks had Zeus and Odysseus; the Norse had Odin and Baldur; and the Irish had Lug Lámfada and the Mórrígan. Apart from the Native Americans’ religions, however, America has never had its own mythos. Characters such as Johnny Appleseed and Briar Rabbit emerged in folklore, but Johnny Appleseed wasn’t exactly leveling buildings and taking down Nazis to plant his apple trees.
It seems we created our own Odysseus and Hercules with Batman and Superman. Like their fictional identities, they also appeared at a time when we needed them. Captain America, for example, appeared during World War II, a time when Americans needed a figure to rally behind as they took on Nazis. Captain America also came at a time we perceive as more sincere and patriotic, and many critics and film buffs praised the 2011 film for retaining these authentic qualities. Snarkiness is better left to Tony Stark from the Iron Man series, a Cold War-era hero. The Cold War influences were later equated with terrorism for the 2008 film, but the switch-up worked.
Looking at our superheroes also tells us about ourselves; all mythological heroes embody what the culture sees as its virtues. For the Greeks, it was intelligence, strength and honor. In America, among the most honored qualities is self-determination. It’s the ability to watch your parents die in front of you or escape an exploding planet and not need years of therapy. Underneath the silly costumes, American mythical heroes are strong, rugged, independent and very manly. Fittingly, their villains range from brainy mad scientists like Lex Luthor to the effete trickster Loki.
At the same time, just appearing in a comic book does not make one a mythical superhero. Eric from The Crow, later filmed in 1994 with the late Brandon Lee, is invincible and determined to get the bad guys. But few would consider him a superhero; he acts out of personal vengeance, not justice — he’s just too dark. To look at some comic book characters objectively, V from Alan Moore’s V for Vendetta is a crazy terrorist, Frank Castle as the Punisher is an unrelenting murderer and Eric is a manic depressive zombie. Though they might have heroic qualities, they don’t fall in line with the “All-American Way.”
America had its thirst for superhero films revived with 2000’s surprise hit X-Men, although we have had superheroes onscreen since the early ’40s. Our heroes have changed with the times, however. Batman was campy in the Adam West 1966 film. In Christopher Nolan’s 2005  Batman Begins, he is brooding and tortured, but he is still a force of good against evil, even if his antics attract many of the crazies to Gotham. It is a characterization that seems more realistic to the more cynical modern audiences of today. At the same time, he is still a fighter for justice and protecting the common people  — just more obviously affected by his parents’ brutal death and his confrontations with psychotic killers.
This summer The Avengers will be an amalgamation of different films. But it is far from the culmination of the superhero genre. The genre still has adventures in parody to discover, as with the beautifully biting Kick-Ass in 2010. In the future, look out for sequels to Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, as well as the upcoming blockbusters The Amazing Spiderman, Man of Steel and The Dark Knight Rises.

For a thriller, Margin Call shows very little action and climax.
Margin Call is a realistic investigation into the behind-the-scenes turmoil that bubbles inside the pot of an unnamed Wall Street financial titan — the last simmer before disaster boils over.
The film is set in a 24-hour window before the cusp of the 2008 financial crisis. Anyone who’s read the news since then knows what happens: large financial institutions collapse, stock markets crash and global economic recession reminiscent of the Great Depression strikes — no surprises there.
Pre-meltdown · Zachary Quinto and Penn Badgley portray investment bankers caught in the middle of swift-developing revelations regarding the country’s reeling financial markets in 2008, which goes on to collapse. - Photo courtesy of Roadside Attractions
Written and directed by J.C. Chandor, the film leaves the explanation of financial mumbo-jumbo and the investment lexicon to documentaries like Inside Job. This isn’t really a movie about the economic zeitgeist; it’s a human story, a chilling and insightful picture of human greed and guilt.
The movie starts slow and calm, like the eye of a storm before the worst hits. Guys in business suits hunch over their desks, staring intently into screens twitching with numbers and graphs. And then risk analyst Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) is called in by the human relations department for a talk, in which he is terminated with no explanation.
As Dale leaves the office, he encounters his junior analyst Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto, also one of the film’s producers) and slips a USB flash drive into his hand, requesting that Sullivan decrypt some figures he had been studying. Dale’s last words as the elevator door closed in his face: “Be careful.”
Sullivan, once a rocket scientist with a degree from MIT, manages to decode the files, unleashing information about the perilous, unsalvageable financial state of investment firms. It is almost midnight, but he calls his boss, who calls his boss, who calls his boss, who calls his boss. Helicopters chop in, and meetings after meetings ensue. No one sleeps.
The nature of the simplistic plot doesn’t leave much room for beautiful cinematography, steamy romance or action-packed car chases.
Most of the scenes take place behind closed office doors. The writing isn’t anything deep or revolutionary, but much of the thrills here are layered between subtle expressions and business language (other than a smattering of Oh my gods, F-ck mes and F-ck yous).
The entire film is about an organized panic to embellish a wreck that would inevitably stink up the financial world. The only way to make out of it alive is for this group of fiscal chess players to screw others over first, by convincing other companies to buy their spoiled goods at an attractive discounted rate.
Chandor, whose father worked for Merrill Lynch for nearly 40 years, shows a strong fundamental understanding of the personalities and interests of Wall Street figures.
Margin Call delineates a series of different characters and their reactions: the apprehensive junior analyst (Penn Badgley) who binge-drinks and sobs on the toilet; the morally conflicted trading-floor head (Kevin Spacey) who weeps for his dying dog while laying off 80 percent of his staff; his agitated British second-in-command (Paul Bettany) with the 2.5 million salary figure; the ruthless top executive (Simon Baker) who swiftly orders a cover-up; and the eerily calm CEO (Jeremy Irons) who coolly dines on steak and wine while his underlings frantically trick other companies into purchasing the worthless assets.
There is no judgment or condemnation. There are no villains, just fallible greed and ambition. It isn’t clear who the main character is, as there is no protagonist or antagonist.
Each character is allowed a sympathetic and honest representation. The camera reveals the expressions of each Wall Street player, capturing every nervous twitch, stunned brow raise and still trepidation as they grapple with the terrible realization that this is big.
Some intense, expressive moments, however, are slipped in between inert scenes, such as when Sullivan looks out the taxi window at the glittering, bustling Manhattan night and whispers, “Look at those people walking on the streets. They have no idea what’s going to happen, do they?”
Or when CEO John Tuld chews medium-rare steak in the sun-soaked backdrop of city skyscrapers and excuses his unethical decision with a placid, “It’s just money. It’s made up. Just pieces of paper so we don’t have to kill each other for something to eat.”
You don’t need an MBA to understand the drama unfolding in this movie. Margin Call’s exposure of this battle for survival and financial security is nothing new to the audience, and perhaps that’s the greatest feat of this film: the recognition that Wall Street is just a classic dog-eat-dog world.

Bombay Beach sounds like an exotic city south of Mumbai, India, filled with dancing, colors and lots of music.
The real Bombay Beach is not that place.
Desolate town · Featuring real and fictional sequences, Bombay Beach explores the essence of the now-isolated community and its people, highlighting the banal and surreal elements of life in the town. - Photo courtesy of Bombay Beach Film
 
In the middle of the 20th century, Bombay Beach, Calif., was a common destination for American families. With a gorgeous shore and a small-town feel, tourists flocked to the destination searching for paradise.
But the Bombay Beach of 1950 has disappeared. In its wake lies a desolate community with a total population of 295, most of which lives in small trailers minutes away from the sparkling beach that taunts the viewer of what it used to be.
It’s surprising to learn that Bombay Beach — celebrated music video director Alma Har’el’s first documentary — is the first film to really depict what exactly is going on in this small town.
Bombay Beach is a rare film; it’s not about political struggles or oil disasters or a financial meltdown. In parts, the subjects break out into dance to music by Beirut and Bob Dylan — sometimes choreographed, sometimes not.
This is exactly the kind of eccentric film the director wanted to create.
Not that it was particularly easy. Har’el said the difficulty of the production lies in her absence of a crew or plan.
“For four or five months, I’d drive down to Bombay Beach every day,” she said. “I was alone and I didn’t have a schedule or plan. I was completely by myself.”
Though some might see a lack of crew as a liability, Har’el channeled the absence into an advantage. Alone, Har’el managed to gain the trust of the Bombay Beach community quickly.
“I tried to develop a relationship with them,” she said. “I was always trying to get what you think is beautiful without pushing them too much.”
According to Har’el, the film’s subjects were very open people and were thirsty for some creativity.
“I think it’s rather boring over there so it’s something that they seemed to be very excited about from the start,” Har’el said.
The cooperation of the people in Bombay Beach is evident; each person is extremely open and shows every inch of their lives no matter how sad nor how happy.
Har’el’s cinematography is one of the film’s strongest elements. Bombay Beach is full of natural beauty; desert mounds, beaches, even the impoverished trailers manage to look stunning against the gorgeous sunset they experience each night. Each shot looks like a moving painting, illustrating the rugged beauty of the town and the people who inhabit it.
Har’el started as a photographer before directing music videos, and stumbled upon Bombay Beach while filming a video for Beirut.
Incredibly popular in the photography world because of its natural beauty, the town ended up being the perfect setting for Har’el’s first feature.
“I was curious about the lives there and I immediately thought I could use the landscape and atmosphere,” she said. “It fascinated me that all these people go there to photograph.”
Har’el’s journey to create Bombay Beach began when she started to think about the people of Bombay Beach, which prompted her to use Mike Parrish, a young boy from the town, in Beirut’s “Concubine” video.
“I loved the video so much that I decided to go back and continue a story,” Har’el said.
Parrish led Har’el to his family, a family dealing with bipolar disorder, poverty and a criminal record whose story was begging to be told.
But Har’el’s storytelling methods are not exactly ordinary.
Though many documentaries follow a certain structure involving interviews, archive footage and a dramatic orchestra score, Bombay Beach forgoes these stereotypaical aspects.
“I’m not too crazy about the talking head format,” Har’el said. “I didn’t want it to be informative or educational.”
Instead, Har’el’s intention was to “capture a certain motion and a mood [that people have] when they’re part of a world that’s small and at the same time special to them.”
“Talking heads,” as she calls them, can be tempting to use. To combat  the cliché and keep her vision in place, Har’el maintained a unique plan.
“I’d film the [interviews] badly,” she laughed. “I didn’t want to be tempted to use it. I didn’t even give myself that option. I just had to find a creative way to weave that into the story.”
Some might see Bombay Beach as a town of limitations, but Har’el believes the limitations sometimes create that specialness.
“I was trying to capture something else, a more child-like view when things are clear to you and you wonder what’s the reality outside of where you live,” Har’el said.
Mission accomplished.

The prosecutors in the Scott Dekraai case announced last Friday they are seeking the death penalty as Dekraai’s punishment for killing nine people in a Seal Beach salon.
I do not look upon this tragic event simply. How could one person kill not only the mother of his eight-year-old son, but other innocent people? I’m torn between demanding an eye for an eye and demanding we value human life as something we cannot take from one another.
Rather than decide our feelings about the death on a purely emotional level, we should instead examine how much the death penalty costs. It’s clear the costs are greater than the potential benefits — which are already limited.
The death penalty costs a lot more than most realize. When we consider cases like Troy Davis’, where the line between guilty and innocent is more muddled than pronounced, it’s easy to see the death penalty is not only costly but ineffective.
Taxpayers have paid more than $250 million for California’s executions, as compared to the $47,000 cost to keep an inmate in jail for life without parole, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. This stark fiscal contrast raises a few questions, but the most important one is whether we are willing to continue spending this much to kill someone.
The death penalty is a moral issue on which many have struggled to fully come to a conclusion. But, supporting spending any money on a person rightfully guilty of murder is something the government should not support. It’s unnecessary, it’s vacuous and it’s simply wasteful spending.
Continuing to enforce the death penalty is ineffective because it doesn’t factor in the chance of wrongly accusing someone of a crime. In Dekraai’s case, this does not apply because he was seen committing the murders. But in many cases, the level of guilt upon those convicted can’t be categorized into a binary, yet it is so often done. Again, think of Troy Davis. The Innocence Project website reports 17 death row inmates have been exonerated through DNA testing.
In the grand scheme of things, 17 lives seems small compared to how many people die every day. But 17 lives that were consciously taken away seems far more grave than a life lost because of natural causes or other variables.
The death penalty is a complicated punishment. We can’t sentence people to death and merely hope it was the right thing to do.
The monumental costs of the death penalty outweigh its supposed positives. The only reward the death penalty allows is revenge, and although my heart goes out to the victims of the shooting, I can’t bring myself to partake in blind revenge.
 
Mellissa Linton is a sophomore majoring in English. Her counterpoint runs Fridays. 
All I got out of this article is once we decide someone is guilty of a capital crime – we need to execute the perp that same day. The capital punishment is not what is expensive – it is the circus we indulge in around the crime that is ridiculously expensive – both financially and emotionally.
Those of us who have actually lost a family member to violence should be the decision makers when it comes to whether the death penalty is a fitting punishment for the culprit. The op-ed author glibly writes “although my heart goes out to the victims of the shooting, I can’t bring myself to partake in blind revenge.” Typical, as anti-death penalty advocates are always more concerned for the perpetrators than they are for the victims. Seeing as how this op-ed writer is not  experiencing the rending anguish of instantly and unexpectedly losing a family member (a parent or a sibling) to a violent rampage, it’s unsurprising that she can’t understand the bitter emotional and psychological torture of such a loss. Anyway, who said revenge is wrong? Oh, that’s right — the “compassionate” folk who are more concerned for the perps than for the victims.
When I read your figures, I was appalled enough to write my opinion here. There’s no way the financial figures that you cite are correct: 
Taxpayers have paid more than $250 million for California’s executions, as compared to the $47,000 cost to keep an inmate in jail for life without parole, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. 
You need  to breakdown the statistics correctly. I know the cost of maintaining ONE prisoner hovers from $30,000 to $50,000 a year. You multiply that out for the number of death row prisoners and the number of years they’re all stuck and you have a figure in the hundreds of millions. $250 million is probably the cost of feeding, housing, and watching over the death row prisoners for the duration of the time they live. 
If you keep someone in prison for life, not only is it taxing for the victim’s loved ones — it taxes us the people as well. So if some guy goes on a killing rampage, it makes sense for taxpayers to house this man and pay for this accommodations when that money can go to better uses publicly? It does not make moral or fiscal sense to me at all. 
Do you know how much tax money the State of California spends to maintain the prison system?
The California death penalty system costs taxpayers $114 million per year beyond the costs of keeping convicts locked up for life.
Taxpayers have paid more than $250 million for each of the state’s executions.
Death row inmates in the U.S. typically spend over a decade awaiting execution. Some prisoners have been on death row for well over 20 years
The length of time that U.S. inmates spend on death row has gotten increasingly longer in recent years, and raises questions about the constitutionality of this added punishment. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not addressed this issue, it has been cited as a serious concern by death penalty experts in the U.S. and by courts outside the U.S. Shortening the time on death row would be difficult without either a significant allocation of new resources or a risky curtailment of necessary reviews.
In conclusion .. DO WE want to spend tax payers money and have this guy alive for the next 20 years?
The death penalty should not take more than 10 years from conviction to execution. All prisoners can have the governor set them free. The governor cannot bring the dead back to life.

The death penalty debate came to the forefront of public discourse in the last few months with controversial court cases such as Troy Davis’. Last week’s Seal Beach massacre is a reminder that heinous crimes that show utter disregard for human life merit capital punishment in certain cases.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
Last week Scott Dekraai walked into a beauty salon in nearby Seal Beach with three handguns and murdered whoever came into his line of sight, notably his ex-wife and the mother of his young son. Eight people died, including a man who was sitting in his car outside of the salon.
The evidence against Dekraai is undeniable. The fact he had threatened his wife before the shooting and walked in with body armor on proves this was not a sudden mental break.
The rampage was a premeditated, callous act and his intent was to kill. If he is found guilty, death is the most suitable penalty. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas agreed when he announced last Friday prosecutors would seek the death penalty against Dekraai.
Though there is no conclusive statistical data regarding whether the existence and implementation of capital punishment is a deterrent of violent crime, if just one person were deterred from carrying out a similar crime by the execution of someone like Dekraai, it would be worth it.
Another common argument against the death penalty is that the state could potentially be killing someone who has been wrongfully convicted.
This is a valid point, as there have been a significant number of death row inmates exonerated since 1973 — 138 as of October 2010 — after evidence of their innocence was produced, according to DealthPenaltyInfo.org.
Many of these cases, however, had doubts to begin with. In cases such as Troy Davis’ — who many still purport to have been innocent at the time of his execution — there were no eyewitnesses, shaky DNA evidence and as the evidence was circumstantial at best.
But in cases such as Dekraai’s, such conclusive evidence removes doubts about his guilt.
When the evidence provides no gray areas or doubts in brutal crimes, the punishment should fit the crime.
Death is a powerful thing, something that should not be underestimated. Just as the deaths of Dekraai’s victims will forever impact those that knew and loved them, the death of Dekraai could leave a lasting impression of our intolerance of evil and our respect and reverence for human life.
 
Sarah Cueva is a sophomore majoring in political science. Her point runs Fridays. 
The death penalty must be reserved by the state to show that some behavior is so far from the mainstream that it must kill the perpetrator. It is not cheap and should no be. One good reason to keep the death penalty and to execute the guilty is to insure that they do not go free. Jails can be escaped. Governors can commute sentences. Death has no escape – until the resurrection.
As someone who normally savages your usually inane, stupid, and insulting articles, this was a pleasant surprise. I disagree with you, but I will respect your opinion, because it is presented with the reasons you believe that. You should try this more often.

In a bizarre incident Wednesday afternoon in Zanesville, Ohio, 56 exotic animals including wolves, monkeys, bears and 18 Bengal tigers were set free from a private reserve and subsequently either shot or tranquilized by police. The animals were let out of their pens by Terry Thompson, 62, who died in an apparent suicide after freeing the animals.
Thompson was released just weeks earlier from federal prison for illegal firearm possession. Officials in Zanesville had previously received and investigated complaints from residents regarding the animal farm. However, they couldn’t take any action since Thompson had the proper permits for keeping the animals. Furthermore, the laws in Ohio regulating exotic animal ownership only apply to instances where the animals are put up to the public for possible compensation.
Sadly, many of the animals were killed in order to protect the safety of town residents. According to The New York Times, one of the sheriffs in charge of the situation said they were unprepared to deal with large animals and did not normally carry tranquilizer darts, so their only choice to protect the public was to shoot.
The killing of the animals — 49 in total, some of which were endangered — led to the outrage of animal rights groups and  the general public. Just six animals consisting of three lions, a grizzly bear and two monkeys were tranquilized and sent to be quarantined at the Columbus Zoo.
There were no human attacks or injuries reported.
