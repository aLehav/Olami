Last Wednesday, doctors at the Keck School of Medicine of USC became the first medical practitioners in Southern California to implant the CardioMEMS Heart Failure System in a patient since it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
CardioMEMS is small wireless device placed in a recipient’s pulmonary artery that enables those suffering from heart disease to independently track and monitor their illness.
Dr. David Shavelle, associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, implanted the device in 71-year-old Alfredo Delatorre of La Puente, California. Shavelle, who called the device a “game changer,” told PR Newswire that traditional methods of monitoring heart disease can be unreliable in predicting future incidents compared to CardioMEMS.
“Before this device, we made medication changes based upon a patient’s symptoms and changes in their weight. Changes in pressures within the heart often occur prior to the onset of a patient’s symptoms,” Shavelle told PR Newswire.
The CardioMEMS system, designed by St. Jude Medical, requires minimally invasive surgery.
A special pillow embedded with a transmitter allows patients to log daily readings of their blood pressure and heart data. Both patients and physicians can access these readings electronically through a secure website.
A heart failure team at Keck will be responsible for monitoring Delatorre’s CardioMEMS. The team includes USC associate professors of clinical medicine Dr. Luanda Grazette, Dr. Michael Fong and Dr. Andrew Yoon, as well as the founder of USC’s Center for Body Computing, Dr. Leslie Saxon.
Using the CardioMEMS system, doctors at USC can assess changes in pressure within Dellatorre’s heart in real time.
The successful implantation at Keck could bring about more widespread use of the CardioMEMS system. Proponents believe the device will have significant effects, such as easing patient-doctor communication and preventing future illness.
“The device is designed to reduce readmissions to the hospital and empower patients to be involved in their own health information,” a PRNewswire press release stated.
CardioMEMS was approved by the FDA after clinical trials showed a 30 percent reduction in hospital readmission for heart disease patients. Shavelle served on the FDA panel investigating the treatment.
Shavelle and the Keck school were selected to perform the first operation because of their familiarity with CardioMEMS.
“I have a ton of experience with this technology,” Shavelle said.
According to the American Heart Association, heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the United States and claims more than 380,000 American lives per year. Heart failure can be related to genetic factors such as abnormal heart valves, as well as more general health issues like high blood pressure and diabetes.
Delatorre, the recipient of the implant, has suffered from heart failure for more than 10 years. He was raised in a small Mexican town where he only had access to home remedies. In a statement to the press, he expressed how lucky he felt to receive the groundbreaking treatment.
“Now I have this new invention,” Delatorre told PR Newswire. “It’s like a gift to my body. It’s like winning the lottery, but it’s better because this is a life.”

The prosecution’s case against Javier Bolden, charged with two counts of murder in the 2012 killings of graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu, resumed at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in downtown Los Angeles Monday morning.
According to testimony given during the trial, early in the morning of April 11, 2012, Ming Qu and Ying Wu were heading back home from an evening with friends. At about 1 a.m. they were both shot and killed while double-parked in a 2003 BMW to the northwest of campus in an apparent robbery attempt.
Last week, prosecutors showed a video of Bolden bragging to a fellow inmate in prison about the killings.
During Monday’s proceedings, Deputy District Attorney Daniel Akemon called several witnesses to the stand to testify about what they observed. Two were male residents of the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue.
Giovanny Ordoñez, one of the witnesses for the prosecution, said he heard what sounded like a loud firecracker explosion followed by shattering glass outside of his residence. He then described walking toward the front of his home and peeking through the blinds to see outside.
Ordoñez said he watched from his window as the male victim, Qu, crawled out from his vehicle and onto Ordoñez’s neighbor’s porch. Ordoñez said he left his residence to help Qu, who Ordoñez said was out of breath and choking on his own blood. Ordoñez then called emergency services.
Euri Maldonado, another witness, testified that he was driving southbound on Raymond Avenue from 27th Street while the BMW was double parked on the west side of the street.
Maldonado said that moments after parking his car and entering his residence, he heard two consecutive gunshots and the sound of glass shattering. He then looked outside his second floor balcony and testified seeing two people surrounding the victims’ BMW who then ran southbound.
Maldonado said that he was unable to see the faces of the running people, but called 911 and went to help the victims. He told the court that he saw the male victim crawl up to the porch of a neighbor’s house and attempt to knock for help.
Both witnesses testified that they approached the BMW to provide Wu with help. They described Wu as crouched on the front passenger seat with her hands covering her face and said she was unresponsive.
LAPD Officer Ricardo Hernandez, who at the time of the incident was assigned to the Southwest Division, testified about his response to the 911 call. Officer Hernandez said he arrived at the scene a few minutes after the emergency call requests. He explained how imperative it was to get Wu and Qu to the hospital and escorted the ambulances to the California Hospital Medical Center. At the hospital, Hernandez said Wu was declared dead and Qu was taken in for surgery and then declared dead.
After reaching a deal with the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, Bryan Barnes, the other suspect in the case, pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and was consequently sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison.
Bolden and Barnes were charged with the murders in May 2012. The families of the slain students filed a wrongful death lawsuit against USC seeking damages, but the case was dismissed in February 2013 on insufficient legal grounds.
Since the 2012 killings, USC has increased its security measures, adding 60 security cameras and additional neighborhood security ambassadors in the surrounding area. After the 2012 Halloween shooting, other new policies included restricting campus access from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and adding security checkpoints for access into campus.
Additional security measures were implemented this fall after the murder of Xinran Ji, a graduate student who was killed this summer on July 24 on his walk home from campus. The university increased its nighttime patrols, enhanced its video monitoring program and has said it would maintain the number of security ambassadors so their numbers will remain constant year round. Previously, they decreased during the summer time.

On Tuesday, Oct. 14, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an executive directive on water conservation to address the increasing severity of the drought in California.
Leakage · Facilities management waters lawns before 7 a.m. to reduce water waste from evaporation as part of USC’s sustainability program. — Mac McDonough | Daily Trojan
 
The directive outlined three main goals: reduce fresh water use by 20 percent by 2017, reduce the Department of Water and Power’s purchase of imported water by 50 percent by 2024, and create an integrated water strategy.
California has been severely affected by the recent drought. Lawmakers have reached a new water bond deal that will be on the Nov. 4 ballot for voters, and Gov. Jerry Brown has requested Californians to reduce their water consumption by 20 percent, according to the Sacramento Bee.
According to the USC Sustainability Office website, USC has significantly reduced water consumption on campus since 2007.
There are currently several water conservation programs at USC. One of these programs, Facilities Management Services’s campus-wide water management system, is designed to reduce water usage. One measure of this system is watering the grass before 7 a.m. to minimize evaporative loss. Moisture sensors monitor the soil to manage irrigation schedules. In addition, Auxiliary Services has installed low-flow showerheads, toilets and efficient washing machines in on-campus housing.
Along with these environmentally friendly measures, there are multiple environmentally-oriented student groups on campus. The Environmental Student Assembly, a branch of Undergraduate Student Government, is one such group focused on environmental and sustainable initiatives.
ESA will soon be launching a university-wide campaign to cut water consumption. The implications of the fountains, pressure washing of sidewalks, and sprinkler use will be addressed.
USC has also formed a “Water Conservation Task Force,” of which Shawn Rhoads, Executive Director of ESA, is a member. “Some objectives of the task force include establishing an accurate water consumption baseline, a reduction target for consumption, and an educational campaign,” he said in an email.
Yet there is still concern over USC’s water consumption when it comes to lawn and plant watering and the numerous fountains on campus.
“ESA believes that the university has a long way to go in terms of water conservation. We hope to voice our opinions and concerns through the Water Conservation Task Force,” Rhoads stated in an email.
There are 29 USC fountains and counting, as there will be a new one built in the USC Village set to be finished in 2017 according to USC News.
“I think the one thing a lot of people forget about the fountains is that they’re using fresh water,” said Jinny Choi, the director of university outreach for ESA. “It’s water that, without the chemicals, could have been used.”
She said that the university places importance on the aesthetic appeal of campus through the numerous lawns, plants and fountains on campus.
“One of the biggest complaints is that we have to pay USC to turn off their sprinklers and fountains whenever we have an event going on, which is really weird because we have to pay them to conserve water,” Choi said. “We’re using so much water for the aesthetic view.”
Choi hopes to see a community across all organizations on campus advocate for more sustainable practices.
“You can’t just dump the responsibility onto one organization,” Choi said. “This is a leading university and as a university that’s in Southern California, I think we should be more aware of our geographic problems and community.”
Editor’s note: story has been updated to include more information from members of the Environmental Student Assembly.

On Monday, the Speakers Committee hosted two former cast members from MTV’s The Buried Life for a talk and meet and greet in the Seeley G. Mudd building on Monday evening.
Do something · Ben Nemtin and Dave Lingwood of the MTV show The Buried Life talk to students on campus on Monday. Students at the event shared what they hoped to achieve from their bucket lists. — Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The Buried Life was a hit reality documentary series that followed four friends originally from Canada — Ben Nemtin, Jonnie Penn, Duncan Penn and Dave Lingwood — as they traveled across North America to mark 100 things off their collective bucket list. As they journeyed in a purple bus named Penelope to complete their list, the four guys also helped strangers they met along the way to achieve their goals and encouraged others to make their own bucket lists, asking each person the show’s tagline question, “What do you want to do before you die?”
The series ran for two seasons from January 2010 to November 2010 and received positive reviews and a nomination for VH1’s Do Something TV Show Award. The four cast members went on to release a New York Times bestseller, What Do You Want to Do Before You Die?
Former cast members Dave Lingwood and Ben Nemtin came to USC to speak about their experiences on the show, answer questions and offer tips on how USC students can achieve their own goals from their bucket lists. According to Speakers Committee director Amanda Schmitt, the members of The Buried Life contacted Program Board about their interest in putting on the event at USC.
Lingwood and Nemtin spent the majority of their presentation discussing details of their adventures as well as their sources of inspiration. After the presentation, they invited audience members to share items on their bucket lists.
Lingwood and Nemtin shared personal stories that originally inspired the four to make a documentary of a road trip across Canada in 2006. Nemtin talked about his struggle to find a passion as a kinesiology major while in college. Lingwood similarly spoke of his inspiration, which he joked was about losing the weight he gained from college and thus, making a huge lifestyle change.
“At that point, we sort of all came together and thought about the things we wanted to do in our lives,” Nemtin said.
By reaching out to local companies and sponsors, they were able to get funds to buy camera equipment and a vehicle, allowing them to document a two-week road trip across North America. They managed to cross off a variety of random things from their bucket list in their native Canada and the United States, including becoming a knight for a day and making the front page of a newspaper.
Eventually they captured the attention of MTV, who offered to make their adventures into a reality documentary series. They started pulling off more and more ambitious feats. From crashing the red carpet to partying at the Playboy Mansion and even playing the basketball with President Barack Obama, the four guys did it while having a moral conscience. They helped both people who reached out to them as well as strangers they randomly met with some of their personal dreams. The Buried Life members were able to buy a truck for a homeless man, reunite an estranged father and son and even give a girl a prosthetic arm.
Lingwood and Nemtin encouraged audience members have big goals.
“Be audacious. Mediocre goals are one of the most competitive places to be. Think about audacious goals because no one is doing that. So statistically, you have a higher chance of getting that one than shooting for mediocre goals,” Nemtin said.
Lea Fang, event co-chair for the Speakers Committee, felt the event was a memorable experience.
“I hadn’t seen The Buried Life before but Dave [Lingwood] and Ben [Nemtin] were hilarious and now I’m inspired to not only watch the show, but also to start working on my own bucket list,” Fang said.
The Buried Life members closed the event by telling the audience about a contest they’re hosting, the winner of which would then be able to take a friend and tour around the world with them. They challenged the audience to send in videos of themselves achieving items on their own bucket lists as part of the contest.

Indie English singer-songwriters can be very likeable. Sentimentality, sensuality and fluffiness are sellable; adding an accent to the equation only elevates the product. It’s easily digestible, but can it register as anything more significant than fodder for pop radio?
Blurring lines · Ben Howard’s new album incorporates the heaviness of the blues to his already-present folk elements of narrative and delicacy. — Courtesy of Ben Howard Music
Being likeable is easy, but conveying meaning and doing it with finesse is an infinitely more challenging endeavor. And it’s a problem that plagues indie folk artist Ben Howard on his second record, “I Forget Where We Were.”
“Has the world gone mad? Or is it me?” Howard implores on “Small Things,” the album’s first song. The lyrics feel like the thesis for a long monologue in which Howard attempts to find his footing and collect his thoughts — to gather the pieces so that he might be able to remember where he was and, hopefully in the process, how he got there.
I Forget Where We Were as an album is brooding and dark, at least relative to the singer’s previous repertoire. Howard’s first album, Every Kingdom, was released three years ago and featured many sappy, pop-folk love songs that easily put him in the same conversation as Ed Sheeran. This second release is much, much different. It’s not what someone would play in a bubble bath; it’s not something someone would necessarily swoon over. It’s something smoldering, something that’s been lit on fire and is slightly smoking, fighting to stay aflame. It’s something that drowns the listener.
On this record, Howard offers a melancholy and palpable vulnerability, which differs vastly from the kind of quirky insecurity typically demonstrated by singer-songwriters. Howard’s most well-known single, “Only Love,” from his first LP features him cheerfully singing, “I’ll be yours to keep / A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep,” and promising his only love shelter, love and security. Howard doesn’t compromise his vivid imagery on the new LP, but instead indicates that sometimes things do go awry and, with perhaps unintentional irony, that love isn’t all that it’s made out to be in songs.
The album has the heaviness of the blues but the narrative and delicacy of folk, the genre to which Howard is most often tethered. Howard’s voice is stronger this time and can feel as viscous as slowly oozing honey while simultaneously effortlessly wispy. There’s definite growth with this album, and though Howard doesn’t achieve it flawlessly on each track, his deep yearning to say something that will resonate is admirable. I Forget Where We Were casts Howard in a different light, one that’s more profound.
The album’s title song, “I Forget Where We Were” has the singer’s voice swelling with straining passion and tumbling softly into a gentle whisper as tumultuously as a crashing wave. The pulsating emotions Howard conveys over a twanging guitar offer a vulnerability that’s raw and poignant. The song builds to a climax with cinematic ease and slowly drops off like a sigh.
Perhaps an obvious indication that Howard has evaded the folk-pop trap is the length of each song. Typically pop songs have a pattern in which the chorus, verse, refrains and bridge are churned out and regurgitated to a point that stops just short of annoyingly formulaic. All but one of Howard’s songs run longer than four minutes, with several five- and six-minute tracks and the album’s longest, “End of the Affair,” in 7:46. The length allows Howard a freedom to showcase his skilled instrumentation and composition while establishing tone and emotion without lyrics.
“End of the Affair,” in addition to being the album’s longest track, is also its standout track. It slowly dissects a breakup with poignant and tortured lamentation both sonically and thematically. What begins as a simple acoustic showcase of Howard’s tremendous, trembling voice builds steadily over the course of four minutes into an orchestral release. As the song crescendos, Howard begins to bellow “What the hell?” underneath the roar until he fades out and lets an unexpected electric guitar communicate his grief.
I Forget Where We Were is a brave step away from the benign but vacant indie folk that is so easy to replicate. It strives to make bold statements, to explore failure and tap into more intricate and personal tales. Moreover, its more complex instrumentation abets Howard’s folk narration and adds a layer of depth to his message.
The album is not without its lapses, but its ambition might give Howard more credibility than other safe, charming but unmemorable English singer-songwriters. With I Forget Where We Were, Howard demonstrates a more realized potential, and his execution of its message suggests that we can expect yet more development and growth to come.

Life in a Walk is comprised of footage from a trip Roth took with his father to walk the historic Camino de Santiago in Portugal and Spain. After his father was diagnosed with prostate cancer, Roth realized that he wanted to take the time to truly hear his father’s life story. During the two-week trek, Roth simply asked his father questions and learned about his life.
“Our relationship went back to that childlike fascination of a child with their parent … I asked everything that I wanted answered,” Roth said.
This personal documentary might seem like a far cry from Roth’s usual work in sports commentary, but it’s precisely his sports experience that led to Roth’s fascination with storytelling.
Roth’s own story begins with his position as quarterback coach and video assistant on then-head coach Pete Carroll’s staff from 2005 until 2009. During his final coaching season, he wrote his first book, From PA to LA, while simultaneously completing his master’s degree from the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
“I wondered if [Carroll and other coaches] remembered the details of their early coaching years, and decided to write From PA to LA in order to capture everything about my own last year of coaching,” Roth said.
In addition to detailing Roth’s last year as a coach, From PA to LA served a secondary purpose of launching him into his new career of storytelling. Roth’s post-coaching successes show that he certainly defies the stereotype of the one-dimensional football jock. Win Forever: Live, Work, and Play Like a Champion, a book he co-authored with Carroll, became a New York Times bestseller. He’s worked as a football analyst for multiple sports networks and produced the Emmy-nominated Elite 11 Quarterback Competition. But amid this impressive portfolio, it was his newest work, Life in a Walk, that impacted Roth the most.
“I’ve never been more moved by a project than this documentary because it’s about someone I really care about … I’ve gotten the most satisfaction from the response from people of all generations, from all across the globe,” Roth said.
All of Roth’s different projects share one commonality: They’re primarily driven by his passion for storytelling. It was a combination of this passion for storytelling and Roth’s strong belief in prioritizing his loved ones that originally motivated Life in a Walk. Roth’s main goal for Life in a Walk, however, isn’t merely to share his father’s story, but to encourage viewers to listen to the stories of their own family members.
Roth hopes that viewers are inspired to “just hit pause and spend time with people they care about.” On the Camino de Santiago, he connected with his father because there were “no distractions, no phone, and no friends, just time. We were just putting one foot in front of the other.”
The Camino de Santiago wasn’t Roth’s first major overseas exploration, or even his first trip with his father. Roth recently sailed around Cape Horn in South America, and previously spent three weeks in India with his father, who shares his sense of adventure.
“My curiosity of the exploration of the unknown drives me the most, but I also like to build up ideas,” Roth said.
Roth’s desire to encourage others to spend time with their own loved ones contributed to his decision to raise funding for the documentary’s post-production costs through crowdfunding site Indiegogo.
According to Roth, using the crowdfunding site allows him to “touch a variety of people,” since contributions are flexible.
Rewards for participation feature ways for people to spend time with their loved ones, ranging from simply “Watch With One You Love,” which includes digital access to the film, to two VIP tickets to the Pac-12 championship game.
Currently, the project has raised approximately $28,365 out of its $50,000 goal, with contributions from 195 different funders. Several funders have left comments on the project’s page, praising the film not only for its story, but for its challenge to prioritize family and friends.
“What I hope happens is that the conversation [about spending time with loved ones] continues, and people get uncomfortable and ask, ‘Am I spending time with the people I love?’” Roth said.
Roth mentioned that he wished that he’d realized the importance of spending quality time with family earlier in his life, which further motivated him share his own story of his journey with his father. In light of this, Roth offered some words of wisdom to USC students:
“I challenge the USC community to recognize the importance of developing relationships and connecting with parents,” Roth said. “It’s definitely worth it.”

When I began cooking for myself in high school, my goal was to create uncomplicated homemade food inspired by my favorite restaurant dishes. I was shocked to discover that almost everything, including store-bought staples such as cereal and bread, was more healthy and flavorful when made from scratch. Candy was one of a handful of items, though, I never fussed with that. I expected it to be time-consuming, tedious and just as indulgent as the individually wrapped alternative. These recipes for homemade chocolate bark and peanut butter cups showed me how wrong I was.
No tricks, all treat · One benefit to making candy from scratch is the ability to know and control the ingredients that go into the confections. — Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
Both items are incredibly easy and fun to make, exceeding their processed counterparts in both taste and texture. The best part is that you can control exactly what goes into them, eliminating the long, indecipherable lists of ingredients that accompany most candy bars.
The chocolate bark is dangerously addictive and comes together in just three steps. Simply melt the chocolate, spread it out on foil and sprinkle it with whatever you have on hand. Tangy dried apricots and cherries and roasted almonds make for a festive Halloween treat, but chocolate pairs well with just about any topping.
My miniature peanut butter cups will convert even the most loyal Reese’s fans. The peanut butter center is tender and silky smooth, enrobed in real dark chocolate and crowned with flaky sea salt. Even though the addition of salt may sound strange, do not skip this step; a tiny sprinkle really accentuates the chocolate’s flavor. Though it was Halloween that encouraged me to make these confections for the first time, they’re sure to become part of my regular rotation.
 
Chocolate Bark with Almonds, Dried Apricots and Cherries 
• 8 ounces dark chocolate, coarsely chopped (about 2 cups)
• ¼ teaspoon flaky sea salt
• ¼ cup roasted almonds, coarsely chopped
• ¼ cup dried apricots and cherries, finely chopped
 
Total: 20 min, plus 1½ hours to chill. Makes about 2 cups.
 
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spread almonds on a baking sheet and roast until dark brown and fragrant, about 5-to-7 minutes. Allow the almonds to cool before chopping them.
2. Place a piece of foil over a baking sheet or another flat surface. Fill a medium pot a quarter full with water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Place chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl over the boiling water and stir continuously until melted. Alternatively, melt chocolate in microwave in 10-second intervals, stirring after each interval until smooth.
3. Spread the chocolate into an even 10-by-8 inch rectangle on the foil. Sprinkle with sea salt, almonds and dried apricots and cherries. Place the bark in the refrigerator until set, about 1½ hours. Break up the bark and store it in an airtight container in a cool place or in the refrigerator.
 
Sugar Rush · Dark chocolate peanut butter cups and chocolate bark with almonds, dried apricots and cherries provide a sweet alternative to the frights and delights of Halloween. They are surprisingly easy to prepare and they are a healthier alternative to store-bought candies. — Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups
For optimum flavor, it is important to use high-quality chocolate and peanut butter. Trader Joe’s offers excellent options at affordable prices. The amount of powdered sugar you will need for the peanut butter mixture varies based on the natural oiliness of the peanut butter. The mixture should be firm enough to roll into a ball without sticking to your hands.
 
• 7 ounces dark chocolate, coarsely chopped (about 1¾ cups)
• ¾ cup creamy salted peanut butter
• 1 tablespoon honey
• 1 tablespoon powdered sugar
• ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
• Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling
 
Total: 45 min, plus 30 min chilling. Makes about 18 mini cups.
 
1. Place paper or foil liners in mini muffin tins. The tins help the cups hold their shape, but if you do not have a muffin pan, arrange the cups on a baking sheet.
2. Fill a medium pot a quarter full with water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Place chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl over boiling water and stir continuously until melted. Alternatively, melt chocolate in microwave in 10-second interval, stirring after each interval until smooth.
3. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of chocolate in each muffin liner and tilt the liner so the chocolate coats the bottom and sides. Repeat with remaining papers.
4. Mix peanut butter, honey, powdered sugar and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. The mixture should be stiff enough for you to handle without it sticking to your fingers. Scoop out a teaspoon of filling and roll it into a ball. Place a ball in the center of each liner. Cover the peanut butter balls with another teaspoonful of melted chocolate. Sprinkle the cups with a pinch of flaky sea salt.
5. Place the peanut butter cups in the refrigerator until set, about 30 minutes. Store the cups in an airtight container in a cool place or in the refrigerator.

USC is located right in the movie capital of the world, Los Angeles and the presence of the prestigious USC School of Cinematic Arts only hammers home this point. With the nexus of the whole industry being here in Los Angeles, the city has been called the most photographed city in the world. But the relationship between the film industry and the city is more complex one than first meets the eye. The 2003 documentary Los Angeles Plays Itself examines that relationship in an exhaustive, relentless video essay comprised of hundreds of clips from movies based in Los Angeles, ranging from multi-million-dollar blockbusters to obscure C-movies. It is a must watch for any hardcore film fan, especially those who live and interact with Los Angeles on a daily basis, but until this week it has only been available to watch on bootlegged DVDs and grainy illegal streams online and at the occasional art house cinema generous enough to show it. On Tuesday, Oct. 21, it will finally be released on digitally remastered DVD, allowing it to reach a wide audience for the first time and pose to them the poignant questions it has been asking for a decade.
Passion project · Director Thom Andersen spent four years compiling and ordering more than 200 clips to create his almost three-hour opus, Los Angeles Plays Itself. The clips form a complex collage of the world’s film capital. – Courtesy of Cinema Guild
So, what took so long? The tangled web of copyright law was the culprit in this case. The film runs for a hefty 170 minutes and is almost entirely comprised of clips from commercially-produced motion pictures. The studios that produced these motion pictures typically employ teams of lawyers to dissect the use of any bit of their movies for potential copyright infringement. Despite this potential for disaster, the Cinema Guild took the plunge this year, and the DVD is primed for release without any rumblings from the studios that struck fear into the film’s creator Thom Andersen for so many years.
It was worth the wait. The film is a tour-de-force. The 200-plus clips flow effortlessly over Encke King’s narration as he covers topics as varied as architecture, geography and even the usage of the acronym “L.A.” instead of the words “Los Angeles.” When the film begins, the clips just start rolling by one after the other. There is little introduction, just a title card and the parade of clips, each accompanied by a small piece of white text declaring the clip’s film and year of release. It takes a little while to gain one’s bearings, as the stream is relentless. But once the viewer has gotten used to the breakneck rhythm of the film, its genius begins to become clear.
Andersen, who attended the USC School of Cinema-Television in the ’60s, spent four years putting together the clips for the exhaustive film, and the time invested shows throughout. Sure, the most iconic L.A. films  — such as Chinatown, Blade Runner, and L.A. Confidential, appear in generous portions throughout, but just as much screen-time is dedicated to obscure films like Timestalkers and Out of Bounds. It gives the sense that Andersen left no stone unturned in his search to lift the mask that Hollywood has created for Los Angeles in the public consciousness.
In the opening portion of the film, King draws the parallel that while people look for narrative in documentaries, we should also look for documentary material in narrative fiction films. It is hard to do while watching one film because the director works so hard at navigating the viewer towards his intended path for the story, but, spliced up and overlaid like this, the way the settings have been used comes into much clearer focus. While watching Blade Runner, the Bradbury Building blends in as one of many shadowy sets in Ridley Scott’s dystopian vision for 2019 Los Angeles. But seeing the iconic building appear in 1940s noir pictures and 1980s lawyer flicks next to the futuristic Runner brings out information about Los Angeles from these films which the original directors could not have imagined their film’s contained.
The sheer variety of ways the same city has been depicted in film is mind-boggling, much so that it is difficult to picture the sheer scale of them. The city and its surrounding areas have been used to depict downtown Chicago, a lake in the Swiss Alps and rice fields in China. The terrain is so varied and the landmarks obscure enough that filmmakers have been able to use it for just about everything. As Andersen points out, however, this versatility has caused Los Angeles to almost appear as a generic city, since it has been used to depict so many other ones. This marginalization through overexposure is the weird contradiction at the center of Andersen’s argument. And it is the one he is combatting the most with his barrage of clips. Like a sort of flipbook, all the muddled depictions of the city blend together into a haze, and the common denominator uniting all the clips, Los Angeles. comes to the forefront. The city is the actual star of the film. Though King’s narration focuses on the city’s depictions — mostly negative observations — the city’s versatility as a character is what the viewer is left with, and this is the ultimate rabbit that Andersen pulled out of his hat with this manic symphony of a film.

For the second straight week, a USC football player was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week. Redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen took home the honor last week, and redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler received the award Monday after his record-breaking performance against Colorado on Saturday.
Move over, Matt · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler broke former teammate Matt Barkley’s passing touchdown record on Saturday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Kessler led the team to victory behind his seven passing touchdowns, setting a new school record, one that had previously been held by former USC quarterback Matt Barkley. Barkley threw six touchdowns on four separate occasions. Kessler’s seven touchdowns also tied the Pac-12 record for most touchdowns in a game. Kessler threw for 319 yards while efficiently completing 19-26 passes — all in just three quarters of work.
Kessler could have exited after the first quarter and still had an impressive day. He led the Trojans to a 28-0 lead after 15 minutes, throwing two touchdowns to junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor and one each to freshman receiver JuJu Smith and freshman tight end Bryce Dixon.
He also tied a school record with five first-half touchdown passes, adding another one to Dixon.
The onslaught through the air did not stop at halftime, as USC came out firing to add to Kessler’s big day. Early in the second half, Kessler threw his sixth touchdown on a 75-yard score to Agholor who finished the day with 128 yards along with his three scores.
Kessler finished his day in the third quarter after his seventh touchdown pass to redshirt freshman receiver Steven Mitchell. His completion percentage of 69.5 percent currently ranks ahead of Barkley’s all-time USC season record of 69.1 percent. This percentage also has Kessler ranked sixth in the nation.
This is Kessler’s third career Pac-12 Player of the Week award. His first came following last season’s upset against Stanford and his second was earlier this year against Fresno State when he threw for a career-high 394 yards in a 52-13 rout.
Kessler and the Trojans face the 19th-ranked Utah Utes on Saturday.

USC’s women’s tennis team swept the title matches at the ITA Southwest Regional Championships on Monday.
Senior Zoë Scandalis, who is ranked No. 15 in the nation, shone in her hometown of San Diego, not dropping a single set en route to bringing home the singles crown.
Scandalous · Senior Zoë Scandalis took home the individual title at the ITA Regionals after her opponent withdrew from competition. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Scandalis represents the third USC player in the last five years to win the singles title but did so in unorthodox fashion. After defeating players from Hawai’i, LMU, SDSU, UCLA and her own teammate, freshman Meredith Xepoleas, in the semifinals, Scandalis earned herself a spot in the championship match against Pepperdine’s No. 20 Lorraine Guillermo.
Guillermo had beaten opponents from SDSU, UCLA, Grand Canyon, Hawai’i and USC (junior Giuliana Olmos) to pave her way to the championship. Though Guillermo had proven herself a worthy opponent, she withdrew from the title match due to illness and forfeited the championship to Scandalis.
With the title, Scandalis, who went 23-11 in singles play last year, punched her ticket to the ITA National Indoor Collegiate Championships in Flushing, New York, at the beginning of November. It will be Scandalis’ third time competing at ITA National Indoors. In 2012, she fell to Tennessee’s Brynn Boren, who later transferred to USC, in the first round.
Scandalis benefited from Guillermo pulling out of the singles match, but the Pepperdine player gave it her all in the doubles match earlier that day against a USC squad.
Freshman Gabby Smith was paired up with Olmos for the first time, and the duo had great success together.
Olmos, the more experienced of the two, said it was difficult adjusting to a new partner.
“It was hard at the beginning,” Olmos said. “We were just trying to play the way we did in practice in the tournament and just trying to transfer that. I think the first couple of rounds were a little harder because we were just getting used to each other’s style and our personalities blending together. We get along really well on the court so that helps out a lot.”
Though Olmos said the first few rounds were the hardest, the scores don’t show it — the duo beat opponents 8-4, 8-3 and 8-3 in the first three rounds after a bye.
In the semifinals, the format shifted from one eight-game set to two six-game sets. This change didn’t shake the Women of Troy at all, though. Smith and Olmos went up against their own teammates, senior Gabriella DeSimone and Xepoleas, in the semifinals. The match was much tighter than any of the previous ones for Smith and Olmos, and they eventually prevailed in a third-set tiebreak, 6-1, 6-7 (4), 1-0 (10-8).
This set up a final clash between the Women of Troy and the Pepperdine squad of Guillermo and Apichaya Runglerdkriangkrai, in which USC came out on top after two extremely close sets, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (1).
Olmos said her chemistry with Smith helped lift them in the title match.
“I think it was really helpful that we’re always really, really positive,” Olmos said. “Even if one of us starts dropping and not playing as well, we’re able to pick the other one up and help the other one really play better and make sure we stay really positive and on track.”
This year marked the first time that the Women of Troy have swept the ITA Regional Tournament since 2010, when then-sophomore Danielle Lao won the singles title and Valeria Pulido and Alison Ramos won the doubles championship.
Though Olmos, Scandalis and Smith stole the show at the tournament, a number of other Women of Troy were in the mix as well.
USC had six players in singles competition, and all but one made it to the quarterfinals of the tournament. Because five of the six quarterfinalists were Women of Troy, four of them were pitted against each other. Scandalis was the only USC player who was matched up against someone from another school: UCLA’s Kaitlin Ray.
Before falling to her teammate Scandalis, Xepoleas worked her way through the previous four rounds, highlighted by a win over UCLA’s Kyle McPhillips, who’s ranked No. 27 in the nation. She beat out her teammate, sophomore Zoë Katz, in straight sets in the quarters, before falling to Scandalis in the semis.
Meanwhile, No. 38 Olmos beat her own doubles partner, Smith, in the quarterfinals. It was a tight match, with Olmos coming out on top, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, before falling to Guillermo in the semis.
Olmos had a tough time playing against Smith in singles after building such a camaraderie in doubles competition together.
“It was definitely very weird because it was a tournament,” Olmos said. “We play each other in practice all the time and it’s really, not playful, but there’s not a lot of stress. But during changeovers we wanted to talk to each other, but we had to stay really serious. It was very competitive, but we also tried to be very civil to each other, because we’re teammates, really good friends off the court and doubles partners.”
Of the three USC doubles teams to enter competition, two of them made it all the way to the semifinals and were forced to face off against each other.
Next up for the Women of Troy is the Kramer Club Intercollegiate in Palos Verdes, California, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 2.

Former USC running back LenDale White made headlines Saturday for tweeting inflammatory remarks about USC Athletic Director Pat Haden. According to White, who was on the sidelines for Saturday’s win over Colorado, when the former Tennessee Titans running back tried to enter the tunnel following the game he was escorted out of the Coliseum by security.
White had been vocal on Twitter in his criticism of the USC coaching staff during the Trojans’ win over Arizona, but the retired NFL player told Gary Klein of the Los Angeles Times that he and Haden had made amends following the Arizona game, which resulted in his visit to the Coliseum on Saturday. Upon being escorted out of the Coliseum after the Trojans’ victory over Colorado, however, White took to Twitter and blasted USC’s athletic director, calling Haden a “coward” and saying that “USC should fire [his] punk a–,” a tweet he later deleted. USC Sports Information Director Tim Tessalone denied Haden’s involvement in White’s removal from the tunnel, but White stood by his comments.
My problem isn’t with the fact that White was escorted out; I’m sure whoever had White removed from the Coliseum tunnel has his or her reasons for not letting the controversial former tailback into the locker room, not the least of which were probably his various remarks about the team’s leadership in the previous week.
My problem is with White’s tweet after he was kicked out, when he said, “…I’m truly embarrassed to b[sic] a #TROJAN I’ve done Wayy[sic] to[sic] much to b[sic] treated like that.” This tweet is still on White’s account, but the reasoning for insisting on this remains unclear. White gets a modest public relations boost and a fleeting wisp of relevance, only to probably sink into post-NFL obscurity once again.
To be fair, the former red zone tailback amassed 52 rushing touchdowns in 541 carries during his time at USC (a pretty ridiculous stat, if you think about it), and did great things for some historically talented USC offenses. It only takes watching a tape of him bowl between the tackles and completely overwhelm defenders en route to pay dirt to make me long for the Pete Carroll era.
But White’s exemplary play in his time at USC doesn’t give him leeway to start trashing the coaching staff one week and then expect to be welcomed into the locker room the next. It certainly doesn’t give him the right to play the victim and rail against the university that ultimately gave him the national-level exposure that landed him a job in the NFL in the first place.
It’s this lack of self-awareness and sense of entitlement that can become a major problem with giving high-profile athletes a public platform. Instead of acting with grace and giving back to the university in a meaningful way, White insists on stirring up headlines and creating more drama for a football program that’s frankly had enough soap opera plotlines and negative ESPN headlines this season.
A former player who calls for the current coach to be fired, as White did after the Arizona game and the Colorado game (both USC victories, I might add), has no place in that team’s locker room, no matter how many touchdowns he had. In a game where team chemistry and “buying in” is paramount, White seems unaware of the fact that his comments and outspokenness are the reason why he shouldn’t be allowed into USC’s locker room.
LenDale White remains one of the finest running backs in USC’s storied tailback lineage. That will never change. What I hope will change is White’s attitude about his contributions to USC. Being “embarrassed” to be a Trojan should never be a sentiment expressed by a member of the Trojan Family, especially over such a minor personal slight. If anything, White’s boorish, self-pitying reaction to this situation is the greater embarrassment.

Let’s turn this around just a tad shall we. Mr. White states that he’s “embarrassed” to be a Trojan. Him 1 Trojans 0. Now, how many Trojans are embarrassed to call him one of our own? I think the final score would be vastly lopsided. It seems getting older does not necessarily mean growing up in his case.

The Trojans stayed at the top of the Pac-12 South standings behind redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler’s record-breaking seven-touchdown pass performance at the Coliseum on Saturday.
Dixon it up · Freshman tight end Bryce Dixon had a breakout game against Colorado on Saturday, catching two touchdown passes. Dixon previously had one score this year, in the season’s first game against Fresno State. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
With Kessler setting a new school record for passing touchdowns in a single game, breaking the previous mark of six set four times by Matt Barkley, USC (5-2, 4-1 Pac-12) took care of business against unranked Colorado (2-5, 0-4) with a 56-28 win. The victory moved USC up two spots to No. 20 on this week’s AP Poll.
Though the Trojans were 20-point favorites against the Buffaloes, head coach Steve Sarkisian was pleased with his team’s performance.
“We were good in the second half,” Sarkisian said. “But I think we can do better.”
Staying Healthy 
Another benefit of the big win was that Sarkisian was able to give some of the veteran players on the team some rest in the second half, leaving the younger players more playing time to develop their skills against a Pac-12 opponent.
Junior defensive end Leonard Williams, who has been the subject of injury troubles that resulted in him missing the majority of practice last week, took 54 reps in Saturday’s game, compared to the 94 he played the week before against Arizona.
Sarkisian was happy that freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith got some special teams experience, taking the second-most snaps on the team in that unit. Smith caught four passes for 104 total yards and a touchdown against the Buffs.
“JuJu [Smith] brings a great attitude and mentality every day to practice,” Sarkisian said. “It showed on Saturday.”
As for injuries, Sarkisian said that senior safety Gerald Bowman is healthy to play against Utah, and that freshman cornerback/wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson will manage the hip flexor injury that he suffered against Arizona throughout the week.
LenDale White Scuffle 
Following Saturday’s game, news surfaced that Athletic Director Pat Haden allegedly had former USC running back LenDale White escorted out of the Coliseum.
After the incident, 29-year-old White took action on Twitter, where he called Haden a coward, in addition to asking for his job.
Sarkisian said that he had spoken to Haden but not White about the incident, and Haden gave him an abbreviated account of what happened.
“They had a discussion on the field and then went their separate ways,” Sarkisian said.
Preparing for Utah 
The Trojans will now spend the week preparing for No. 19 Utah in a game with important implications for the Pac-12 South standings and the national rankings.
The Utes (5-1, 2-1) come into the game with some momentum. Utah defeated Oregon State in Corvallis, Oregon on Thursday night by a score of 29-23.
In addition to having the extra time for rest and preparation, Utah will host the Trojans in a late-night, potentially cold-weather game, conditions that USC players are not accustomed to.
Utah does have a controversy at the quarterback position looming, however, as head coach Kyle Whittingham has gone back and forth between starter Travis Wilson and backup Kendal Thompson in the past three games.
It remains unclear which one of them will be tapped to take the reins of the offense against the Trojans on Saturday night.
USC’s tilt with the Utes will kick off at 7 p.m. and will be televised on Fox Sports 1.

In a bold move that echoes a tech-utopian fantasy, Apple and Facebook are now telling their female employees: “We will pay to freeze your eggs.” Facebook has recently begun covering the costly procedure as part of its insurance benefits, and Apple plans to offer its package deal starting in January. The seemingly generous offer has its perks but also poses a paradox.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
 
Instead of empowering women by freeing them from the ticking of their biological clocks, egg freezing only gives the illusion of autonomy while postponing childbearing to a later time. Reconciling motherhood and a career doesn’t get much easier if the only option these offers put forth is simply not to have a baby yet.
For many college students who will enter the workforce in a few years, the option might prompt the nonchalant response, “Why not?” As one New Yorker writer, Rebecca Mead, put it, “Better an iBaby than no baby at all.”
In Slate, Chavi Eve Karkowsky, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in New York City, argued in defense of egg freezing. “When asked about delayed child-bearing in many studies, the two factors that come up again and again are financial stability and the availability of an appropriate partner,” Karkowsky said. “[The latter] is the one that I think creates the egg-freezing push. At some point, while dating, and waiting, and having hearts broken (or yes, breaking hearts), many women want to start working with what they have, and not waiting for the right XY chromosome carrier to come around.”
It’s progressive that new technology can create such options that cater to single women, but if it’s an alternative that doesn’t provide a better solution to juggling both motherhood and a job, it doesn’t seem like the best idea. Egg freezing is an option because proponents believe that when nature’s deadlines are subverted, the prospects of motherhood — be it finding a suitable partner or securing that job promotion — get better. That’s not the case when the fight is pitted against Mother Nature herself. A woman who forgoes childbearing in her twenties or thirties in order to focus on her career might actually find that the demands of that job in her forties make motherhood seem even more daunting. Add to that the exhausting changes that come with middle age, and the issues compound. It’s a case of delusional fancy to pretend that a woman’s decision to bear children will become entirely her own if she just gets the chance to postpone. Cultural, professional, financial and biological pressures will always be present.
Proposing egg freezing as a solution is a naïve notion that follows a conviction that forward-thinking companies like Apple and Facebook take pride in — there’s always a solution to every problem or an answer to every question if only the right algorithm is found. Unfortunately, reconciliation of professional success and motherhood is a code that can’t be cracked quite so easily. Rather than an issue of time, this struggle to balance is a product of policies in the corporate world that make it harder on women to be mothers and hold jobs at the same time.
The fact that egg freezing is even available shows a lack of policy reform that made it even a need for young women to contemplate whether or not to go through with such a procedure. The limited availability of subsidized care for preschool children and the rigidity of corporate cultures that don’t enable flexible hours for parents of young children are just a few factors that need to change to make career and family more compatible.

Last week, tech giant Apple announced that it would seek to adopt a new policy offering to pay for female employees to freeze their eggs as part of their health care packages, something Facebook started this year in an attempt to recruit more women to their male-majority staff.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
Though this new procedural coverage seems generous at face value, the implicit message requires closer analysis — and it isn’t pretty.
“We want to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families,” Apple said in a statement.
The idea of freezing a woman’s eggs was first proposed as a means to provide cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with a way to combat possible infertility. After the American Society of Reproductive Medicine made the decision to lift the “experimental” label off the procedure in October 2012, demand skyrocketed.
And the reason, of course, is not surprising. By giving women the option to freeze their eggs when they are young and healthy, they are no longer forced to bend to the societal norm of choosing between prioritizing family life over a career. The generous offer in terms of cost is also a perk. Under Facebook’s plan, female employees would be covered for treatments up to $20,000.
Supporters of this move argue that this decision ultimately gives women the best of both worlds — the option to postpone their familial ambitions, if any, in pursuit of furthering their career paths. Though the added benefit appears generous on its face, the implicit message it sends to women in the workforce is less so: Hold off on motherhood instead of your career because you clearly can’t do both.
Anyone who knows the demographics of the tech industry understands that major tech firms — Apple and Facebook included — are predominantly male. In fact, Apple’s most recent statistics, released last August, found that 70 percent of the company’s employees are male, with its leadership roles composed of 72 percent men and their technical positions with 80 percent men. Though the attempt to close Silicon Valley’s gender gap by giving women the choice to stave off their familial goals can be perceived as laudable, the implicit repercussions this decision can have are far more troubling.
The problem arises when this opportunity turns into an expectation, and the expectation turns into a demand; by encouraging women to put motherhood on hold to be able to focus on their careers, these companies begin to imply that women are simply incapable of doing both, especially at the same time. Suddenly, the long-held practice of refusing to hire a woman on the basis that she might decide to have a family transforms into bypassing women for jobs because she won’t take the option of forestalling a family life, should that option be available. Such a stigma is not only archaic, but also inherently detrimental.
Decisions about one’s career and familial aspirations are important and incredibly private. Despite the potential perks that employers can provide to help with this decision-making process, they ultimately have no place in it. Wherever a woman’s focus lies — be it career, family or both — her employer should have no say in it. As well intentioned as this new proposal might be, it fails to recognize that women don’t need to give up a full family life to build a successful career.
