The USC Auto Club held its second annual auto show on Sunday along Trousdale Parkway featuring 61 cars ranging manufactured between 1965 and 2015.
The event attracted hundreds of people throughout the day.
The event was planned over the course of six months and was held in conjunction with Reach Out Worldwide, a disaster-relief charity created by late actor Paul Walker. The event also served as an act of remembrance for Auto Club member Wing Hay Tang and Matt Edmondson, who both passed away this year. The event was sponsored by Fiat, Motor Village of Los Angeles and Pep Boys.
“It’s insane; this show is 10 times better than last year’s,” said Gerilynn Eierman, president of USC Auto Club. “We have more cars, more variety and there’s a better turnout. I never thought it would be this big. It’s been a really rewarding experience.”
Club members worked with several university organizations to put on the show, including the Dept. of Public Safety and USC hospitality. The event featured cars from America and Germany to Japan and Italy, including an original and extremely rare, full-competition Shelby Cobra.
“It raced in England and the United States and set track records in New Hampshire and West Virginia in the late ’60s,” said owner of the Shelby Cobra, Anthony Boosalis. “I saw my first Cobra about 25 years ago and fell in love with the styling. Eleven years ago, I met the president of a local Cobra club and he helped me find one. It’s a wonderful opportunity to have my car here on the Trojan campus.”
Jason Perls Miller, a graduate student at the Leventhal School of Accounting, also featured his 1970 Ford Mustang convertible, the lowest produced convertible ever made by the manufacturer.
“My mom got the Mustang in 1971 with about 1500 miles on it, and it’s been in the family ever since,” he said. “In 2009, I restored it. It’s going to take a lot for me to sell it — too many memories.”
The club was founded in 2012 by Aaron Bajor, a junior majoring in business administration. Made up of only a few students in its beginning stages, the club’s membership has grown to 575 students and alumni.
“When I came to USC, since it’s in L.A., which is the car culture of the West Coast, I was really disappointed to see that there wasn’t a community for that,” Bajor said. “I wanted to create an organization in the community that would bring together car enthusiasts and have some outlet for us to come together on a casual, recreational basis. At the end of the day, it’s about having a family.”
The club holds open-door meetings for its executive board every other week, where they discuss potential events and activities. They also watch an episode of the show Top Gear every week and go out to dinner afterward. There is also a Facebook group where members make posts about anything from car recommendations to questions about repairs.
“We’ll have events with guest speakers from the auto industry, we’ve gotten people internships, we go to car shows, we might go to the race track,” Bajor said. “It’s really what people make out of it. I’m just glad to see how much it’s grown — it’s come a long way.”

USC’s Model United Nations hosted their third annual Southern California Model United Nations conference over the past weekend for high school delegates. A total of around 180 delegates from 15 high schools attended the conference with most hailing from Southern California or the L.A. metropolitan area and a few from the San Francisco Bay Area. The conference was held at the Von Kleismend Center and offered a range of activities for the high school students.
The conference’s theme was global security and privacy with an emphasis on technology and ethics in society. MUNSC featured eight scenarios and a total of 11 committees. There were two general assemblies —the disarmament and security committee and economic and social committee. The conference also had three joint crisis committees, which had high schoolers working on both sides of a conflict. These committees included the 1983 U.S. and Soviet Union cabinets, The Troubles with the British and Irish Republican cabinets, and the upcoming 2016 election between the DNC and RNC. Other scenarios explored during the conference included the League of Nations during the Italo-Abyssinian War and even the futuristic issue of space colonization and interstellar politics.
Shikhar Gupta, secretary general of MUNSC and the conference, helped organize the event. According to his invitation address to the high school students on SCMUN’s website, SCMUN was uniquely designed to have a range of crisis committees as well as nontraditional roles such as corporation and press roles. In doing so, MUNSC was meant to mimic college-level conferences to challenge the high school students.
Drew Schmidt, president of MUNSC and the director general for the high school conference, expressed his enthusiasm for the growing conference as well the opportunities it contained for the high school students.
“[SCMUN] is going really well for being so young in its infancy,” he said. “It takes a while to earn the trust of the high schools. A lot of the time, because they’re going to spend money on it, they want to go to the [conferences] they’ve always gone to so getting new high schools to choose to come to MUNSC is our biggest challenge but it’s really fun to be on the forefront of something new.”
According to Schmidt, the conference was designed to challenge the high school students in their ability to improvise and make fast decisions.
“Our conference is very crisis-oriented,” he said. “We love helping the high schoolers develop the skills to think on their feet. There’s no substitute to learn how to speak in front of other people.”
Max Hill, a sophomore majoring in international relations, and Brian Walsh, a sophomore majoring in accounting, both joined MUNSC recently and helped out in the 1983 U.S. and Soviet Union joint crisis committee.
“We’ve been putting the delegates through different scenarios and guiding them throughout the process to see what responses they have for our updates,” Hill said. “It took a very different turn from history, though — they ended up nuking each other. But it was very fun because we mix reality up a bit.”
Claire Catlin, a junior at Palos Verdes High School, was part of the Republican Party for the joint crisis committee that imitated the 2016 election cycle. She imitated the role of Ben Carson.
“They had actual news that was polls and rumors,” she said. “It wasn’t super structured, and it was more debate style. The committees weren’t super big so we could actually get work with other delegates.”
Catlin is in her first year of participating in Model UN at her high school.
“I like Model UN as a whole because there’s a lot of debating and you get to learn a lot of information you wouldn’t normally [learn],” she said. “I didn’t know a lot about the election process beforehand. And I’m voting in the next election so this has been really helpful.”
According to Schmidt, the next school year will be an exciting year for MUNSC because not only will they host another high school conference, they will also host a college conference called TrojanMUN for intercollegiate delegates. As for away conferences, the organization plans to travel to universities all over the nation, including Columbia University, Georgetown University, UC Santa Barbara, McGill University, Princeton University, UC Berkeley and UCLA.
“We earned a lot of awards this year from our travel team and just generally showed up on everybody’s radar on the east coast, where [MUN] is a well-established hobby and sport,” Schmidt said.
For the next MUNSC, Schmidt hopes to expand the number of attending delegates to be 250 to 300 high school students.
Schmidt said the experience he’s gathered from participating in Model UN has been invaluable and hopes the experience for high school students will be similar as they learn impromptu speaking.

Five USC students plan to launch the bike-share program, Ryde, on campus this upcoming fall semester.
Ryde allows students to use bikes located all over campus. Ryde is controlled by an app where users can pay by use or through subscription. The app allows users to locate bikes near them and also reserve a bike when they are on the way to receive it. The team is also developing a feature that allows the bike to lock itself after use or when left idle.
The Ryde team includes Pranav Sudesh, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering; Ashan Marla, a freshman majoring in computer science; Caroline Zhong, a senior majoring in international relations (global business); Jon Koehmstedt, a junior majoring in computer science; and Spencer Pearlman, a freshman majoring in business cinematic arts.
The team has received help from Paul Orlando, an adjunct professor who runs the USC Incubator, during their program’s development.
According to Sudesh, Ryde will improve student transportation on campus.
“You don’t have to worry about owning a bike [or] maintaining it, but it’s always there when you need it,” Sudesh said.
Sudesh said bike sharing can help free up space on campus.
“Administration is not so pleased with the number of bikes on campus,” Sudesh said. “Bike sharing has a lot more potential than just giving out free bikes, because … it’s pretty easy for people to share 100 bikes.  On the other side, you’re removing 200 bikes from campus, because all of those people, instead of owning their own bike[s] … are sharing a system that declutters the area.”
Ryde was a finalist in the USC New Venture Seed Competition and is still waiting to hear back on who won. Ryde also participated in Startup Equinox and and a SparkSC event: Arts, Grooves and Food.
Marla said Ryde will begin in fall 2015.
“We’re aiming to roll out a soft launch in this coming fall,” Marla said. “We will be somewhere supplying somewhere between 10 to 20 bikes and just seeing whether USC is ready for bike sharing and whether this bike-sharing system that we’ve developed [can] work on campus. We also want to see how students react to it, because at the end of the day, this is for the students.”
The bike share program also worked with USG to create a plan to implement the sharing system that targets future freshmen.
Marla said USG’s help has been important for program development.
“USG has been the leading advocacy for Ryde up until now and we’re here and we’re going to be launching as a result of them supporting us so much,” Marla said
Marla said Ryde could possibly branch to other campuses if the USC system is successful
“We’re first trying to see ‘does USC respond well to it’,” Marla said. “We’re trying to really tailor … [this] service to the Trojans [but] later on if it works, awesome, that’s something we can share with a lot more people, but right now our focus is just enhancing and making it optional for a USC student just to hop on a bike.”
Great work, Ryde. Make us proud and bring bike-sharing to USC.

High school students across California attended the Young Women’s Political and Civic Leadership Program at the Radisson Hotel at USC on Saturday where they listened to keynote speakers discuss the importance of women taking on leadership positions in politics, government and public affairs.
The event was presented by the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Women’s Student Assembly, Political Student Assembly, Arsalyn Program of the Ludwick Family Foundation, Junior State of America, California YMCA Youth and Government, California Women Lead and Alliance Patti & Peter Neuwirth Leadership Academy. Representatives from the Los Angeles Times, the Los Angeles Community College District Board and the Price School of Public Policy were in attendance.
Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, kicked off the event by giving a brief opening statement to the students and by introducing two USC student leaders and co-moderators for specific panels, in the realm of politics: Sarah Dhanaphatana, news editor of the Daily Trojan, and Camille Patrick, a junior majoring in business and cinematic arts. During the introduction, Dhanaphatana and Patrick explained the importance of the event and encouraged the young high school students in attendance to take action to bridge the gender inequality present in politics.
Dhanaphatana explained there must be a shift of discourse when it comes to talking about women in politics. She said that individuals must change the question from “Are women capable of fulfilling a role in politics?” to “Yes, women are capable; now what steps will they take to successfully shape politics?”
Following that introduction was a brief panel featuring Kyle Finck, the section lead for the High School Insider of the Los Angeles Times, and Suzy Jack, vice president of projects of the Los Angeles Times and USC alumna, provided the young women with advice on how to kick-start their careers in politics at a young age.
The next panel featured Mayor Lindsey P. Horvath of the city of West Hollywood, where she discussed the challenges she faced as a woman in the political realm. She recognized that many women do not feel confident in the political arena, and she encouraged them to reverse that stigma.
At the end of her speech, Horvath gave out her phone number so that the girls could reach out to her.
Guest speakers also included Mona Pasquil, former deputy lieutenant governor for California.
In the afternoon, USC students participated in a panel where they provided the young women with networking tips.
Jordan Fowler, Undergraduate Student Government vice president, told the girls about the importance of staying true to themselves.
“It is so important to remain confident,” she said. “You are all so amazing and leaders in companies can learn as much from you as much as you can learn from them.”
Shyann Murphy, executive co-director of the Women’s Student Assembly, spoke to the girls about failure.
“Failures are going to happen, but it is through failure that we learn most from,” she said.
Murphy also addressed the importance of getting involved.
“Really jump in and get involved as much as possible and find something that you are truly passionate about,” she said.
Fowler said that these events are important to empower women to step up and take on leadership roles.
“I was really shy when I was growing up, and it is so important for young girls to constantly be encouraged. Growing up, if I would not have had people telling me to get out of my comfort zone, I definitely would not be where I am now,” she said.
Rini Sampath, USG president, talked about the reception after the event where the girls had the opportunity to network.
“These girls are so talented and they benefit a lot by hearing from college students,” Sampath said.
Sampath said that the program throughout the years have given her the opportunity to meet young women and hear about their journeys to positions of leadership.
“Last year, I met a young girl at the reception of this same event and we kept in touch,” she said. “She ran to be president of her class and won.”

The USC baseball team split the first two games of their weekend series against the Oregon State Beavers, winning handily on Friday night but losing in walk-off fashion on Saturday afternoon.
The Trojans (30-11, 11-6 Pac-12) benefitted from great starts in each game, as both Tyler Gilbert and Kyle Twomey turned in seven complete innings and allowed three runs or less in their respective starts.
On Friday, USC backed Gilbert with an offensive outburst, defeating the Beavers 11-3 after falling behind to an early 1-0 deficit. After Oregon State got on the board with a solo home run in the bottom of the third, the Trojans responded quickly, putting up two runs in the top of the fourth with RBI singles from Timmy Robinson and Blake Lacey.
They added two more in the top of the fifth against Beavers ace Andrew Moore, who entered the game with a sparkling 0.68 ERA in conference play. He proved to be only human against USC, however, as the Trojans tagged him with six runs on nine hits through only 6.1 innings of work.
After chasing Moore from the game in the seventh, USC tacked on seven more runs in the seventh and eighth innings to bust the game wide open. Gilbert lasted until the bottom of the eighth for the Trojans, but the Beavers rallied for two runs in the inning to end his night.
USC’s 11 runs on 13 hits were more than enough to give Gilbert and the Trojans the win in the first game of the series. This proved crucial on Saturday, as the Beavers showed exactly why it is so hard to play on their home field.
In the second game of the series, the Trojans fell into an early hole, as starter Kyle Twomey yielded runs in the first and third innings. After the shaky start, Twomey settled in nicely, turning in seven innings of two-run ball on only four hits.
The Trojans came back in the top of the sixth on four straight singles, including RBIs from Timmy Robinson and Dante Flores, but they were unable to break the tie, even with base runners in the seventh, eighth and ninth innings.
Relief pitcher Marc Huberman held the Beavers in check in the eighth inning of the 2-2 game, but Oregon State proved too much for the Trojan bullpen in the bottom of the ninth. After Huberman allowed a leadoff walk and a sacrafice bunt to move the runner to second, reliever Kyle Davis came in to try to send the game to extra innings.
He was unable to do so, however, as Billy King singled through the right side to plate the winning run in walk-off fashion for the hometown Beavers, winning 3-2.
This week, Trojans will host Cal State Fullerton at Dedeaux Field on Tuesday night, then travel to Salt Lake City for a three-game set this weekend against the University of Utah.

This last week of school marks the end of my sophomore year, or the halfway point in college. Everyone uses different events to signify milestones in their lives. For me, USC athletics has been that marker. Like any crazy Trojan fan, I remember exactly where I was and what was happening for the biggest moments of USC sports while I have been alive.
As irrational and insane as that sounds, that is the beauty of sports. We identify with teams and connect to them on a visceral level. Our spirits rise with big wins over rivals and deep runs into the postseason. They fall with inept coaching decisions and  no-shows in big games.
So, it’s only natural that when reflecting on the first two years at USC, sports play a major role in that process.
After all, I’ve been a fan for more than three quarters of my life thus far. It started pretty early on.
I remember watching Mike Williams make unbelievable one-handed grabs against Oregon State during one of my first Coliseum experiences. I remember watching Carson Palmer light up Notre Dame on a Saturday night while I was sitting in the basement of a synagogue in Chicago. Then the Trojans played Iowa in the Orange Bowl and withstood a kickoff return for a touchdown to start the game, as they came back and obliterated the Hawkeyes and started their streak of dominance over the Big Ten. I was hooked.
I remember the fourth-and-9 to Dwayne Jarrett and the subsequent Bush Push on a Saturday afternoon in mid-October. USC’s 66-19 victory over UCLA also happened to be during my sister’s bat mitzvah, which is the Jewish rite of passage into adulthood. USC’s heartbreaking loss to Texas was one of the first days of second semester of fifth grade. Needless to say, I didn’t go to school the next day.
I remember touring a new middle school in the fall of 2006. My mind wasn’t on the place, but instead trying to find my dad who was listening to USC’s matchup against Oregon State. USC lost 33-31 after John David Booty’s pass was tipped, followed by another school tour with another tipped pass and loss, this time to UCLA. Therefore, I was pretty wary of school tours at that point.
I remember sitting at my friend’s house, he was a UCLA fan, and forcing him to watch Daniel Hackett locking up Kevin Durant as USC upset Texas in the NCAA tournament and almost beat North Carolina in the next round until Taj Gibson went out with five fouls. I thought that was the start of a powerhouse for USC basketball. I was wrong.
I also remember the low points. I remember where I was on a Sunday morning when the news came out that USC was sacrificing the basketball team by imposing sanctions on themselves. I remember USC coming so close to upsetting Michigan State in the NCAA tournament, but losing in the final two minutes.
I remember USC getting blown out by Oregon on Halloween, which was the beginning of the end of the Carroll era. It wasn’t until a few weeks later, when Jim Harbaugh went for two and stuck the proverbial fork in Pete Carroll’s tenure at USC, that I realized dynasties don’t last forever.
I thought Lane Kiffin might be able to keep the party going, but it turns out winning is just a little bit harder than Pete Carroll made it seem. The same could be said about Kevin O’Neill and Tim Floyd.
All these memories have one thing in common. I grew up thinking USC was infallible, that continued excellence was guaranteed, and that nobody would ever challenge USC’s dominance of the Pac-10.
By high school, I realized all of these things were false. I should have listened to my dad and uncle when they said to cherish the championships because greatness doesn’t last forever. Yet, as an eternal optimist I thought that maybe fortunes would change when I moved to the student section.
With the exception of the incredible upset victory over Stanford, the first two years of my time at USC have been marred by mediocrity in football and basketball. Four and five-loss seasons just don’t cut it at ’SC for football, and neither do two or three-win seasons in the Pac-12 for basketball.
If these sound like the lamentations of a spoiled fan, it’s because they are. I was spoiled by Pete Carroll and Rose Bowls galore. That became an annual expectation, and one I hope the Trojans get back to soon enough.
Outside the context of athletics, USC is the greatest school in the world to attend anyway. The classes are great, the students are always happy, the weather is even better, and there is nothing quite like the Trojan family. That being said, it feels like something is missing. That something is national titles.
USC fans aren’t content with  third-place finishes and the occasional victory over a rival. We want excellence, all the time. Plain and simple. Though the last two years have taught me what it means to be a true fan by sticking with the basketball and football team through leaner times, I’d rather have victories.
Hopefully, Steve Sarkisian and Andy Enfield can turn the fortunes of their respective programs around and again compete for national titles and tournament berths on an annual basis. That would make the final two years of college that much sweeter.

The USC men’s tennis squad will head into the NCAA tournament as conference champions. The team took down UCLA and Stanford last week in Ojai en route to its first Pac-12 Championship since 2012.
USC automatically advanced directly to the semifinals of the Pac-12 Championship thanks to its No. 2 seed and Stanford, as the No. 1 seed, advanced directly to the semifinals as well. UCLA and California, the No. 3 and No. 4 seeds respectively, didn’t have to play until the quarterfinals. The first two matchups of the tournament were No. 5 Oregon against No. 8 Arizona and No. 6 Washington against No. 7 Utah.
During the first round on Wednesday, both of the higher seeds won their matchups. Oregon defeated Arizona by a score of 4-1 and Washington shut out Utah 4-0. The next day, both Oregon and Washington were knocked out of the tournament by their fellow opponents. California squeezed by Oregon 4-3 while UCLA swept Washington 4-0.
With the win on Thursday, UCLA was set to play USC on Friday in the semifinals.  The Trojans made quick work of the Bruins, eliminating them from the tournament with a 4-1 victory. The match began strong for the Trojans when seniors Yannick Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz, who are ranked No. 3 by the ITA in doubles play, completely shut down the Bruin pairing of Mackenzie McDonald and Martin Redlicki with a score of 8-0.  The Trojans secured the double point soon after when the pairing of junior Max de Vroome and senior Eric Johnson defeated Joseph Di Giulio and Karue Sell by a score of 8-2.
The Trojans carried their momentum into singles play, capturing the first singles point when sophomore Nick Crystal defeated Di Giulio 6-2, 6-1. Then, McDonald defeated No. 11-ranked Hanfmann 6-3, 6-4 to give UCLA what would turn out to be its lone match point.  Senior Jonny Wang put the Trojans back in the win column when he took down Sell by a score of 6-4, 7-6 (1).  De Vroome punched the ticket to the final for the Trojans after coming back from a first set loss to win his match against Austin Rapp in three sets with a score of 6-7, 6-1, 6-3.  Quiroz’s match against Redlicki and Johnson’s battle with Dennis Mkrtchian were suspended following De Vroome’s victory.
Stanford ended Cal’s tournament by beating them 4-1 in the semifinals, so the stage was set for a showdown final between No. 1 Stanford and No. 2 USC. A few weeks earlier, Stanford had taken down USC 4-3. USC also had beaten Stanford earlier in the year during a non-conference match-up by a score of 6-1, however.
The Trojans struck first in doubles play, with Crystal and freshman Thibault Forget claiming an 8-2 victory over Nolan Paige and David Wilczynski.  Stanford fought back, tying the doubles score 1-1 when the No. 13-ranked pairing of John Morrissey and Robert Stineman bested Hanfmann and Quiroz 8-6. The deciding match went to Stanford when Tom Fawcett and Maciek Romanowicz took down de Vroome and Johnson by a score of 8-5.
With Stanford winning the doubles point, the Trojans knew that they had to win at least four of their six singles matches to win the Pac-12 Championship.  Wang was the first Trojan to help contribute to those four wins, beating Paige by a score of 6-2 two sets in a row to give the Trojans their first match point. Quiroz then put the Trojans on top 2-1 with a two set (6-4, 6-4) victory over Wilczynski.  The Trojans wouldn’t enjoy that lead for long as Stanford’s David Hsu knotted the score at 2-2 shortly after when he took down De Vroome 7-5, 6-4.  Fawcett then gave Stanford a 3-2 lead when he came back from a first set loss to defeat Hanfmann by a score of 2-6, 6-1, 6-2.
With the pressure on them, both Johnson and Crystal needed to win their matches for a Trojans victory while Stanford only needed one of their two remaining players, Romanowicz and Morrissey, to win their match to clinch the Pac-12 Championship.  Crystal kept the Trojans alive by defeating Romanowicz in two sets by a score of 7-6, 6-4.  Thus, the Pac-12 Championship came down to Johnson’s match with Morrissey.  The match went to three sets, and it was Johnson who had the stronger final set, ultimately winning the match 6-2, 4-6, 6-2.  The victory gave the Trojans both a come-from-behind 4-3 win over Stanford and the Trojans the title of 2015 Pac-12 Champions.
With the victory, the No. 8-ranked Trojans also earned the automatic qualifier from the Pac-12 into the NCAA Tournament, where the Trojans will try to reach the final goal of winning their sixth national championship in seven years. The Trojans will begin their journey during the NCAA First and Second Rounds, which will be held May 8 and 9.

In an epic five-set thriller with 2,000 fans on hand at the Galen Center, the No. 8 men’s volleyball team advanced to the semifinals of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament with a victory over No. 6 BYU Saturday.
The win served as sweet revenge for the Trojans, who were eliminated by BYU in Provo last season during the MPSF tournament.
“I think it’s the biggest one,” sophomore middle blocker Andy Benesh said when asked where the win ranks in his career at USC. “We lost last year at BYU in Provo in three, and it’s playoff time. To win in five, it’s huge.”
The Trojans went back and forth each of the five sets. The Trojans won the first set 25-17, BYU evened it up with a 25-20 win in the second set, USC took the third set 25-22 and BYU stayed alive with a 25-23 win in the fourth set.
But the Trojans got the final, decisive answer in the seesaw battle. In the fifth set, the Trojans built up a 14-11 lead and had three match points to close out the victory. BYU climbed back to 14-13, and it looked like the fifth set might need to go past the 15-point mark for a team to win by two.
But junior outside hitter Alex Slaught killed the final point, his 21st kill of the match, closing out a 25-17, 20-25, 25-22, 23-25, 15-13 win.
Slaught’s 21 kills led the match for the Trojans. Freshman outside hitter Larry Tuileta had 18 and senior opposite Cristian Rivera added 14. Middle blockers Benesh and senior Robert Feathers contributed seven and six respectively. Senior setter Micah Christenson, who assisted on 59 kills on the night, also killed five of his own points.
Benesh said the key for the Trojans this time around was on serving and passing. Though BYU had one more ace and six fewer service errors, he said they were still able to put on a lot of pressure from the service line and handle BYU’s pressure.
“I thought on serving and passing, we won that battle,” he said. “We really controlled the match.”
Benesh added that while the team struggled to some degree hitting, different guys were still able to push through all match. The Trojans hit for only .231, below their season average of .269, but they were able to hold the Cougars to only .196.
“People [were] persevering through some hard times in that match,” he said. “I know Alex Slaught was getting really mad at himself but he came up huge, especially in that fifth set.”
The Trojans outblocked the Cougars, recording 13.5 team blocks to only 11 from BYU. Defensively, junior libero Brooks Varni led the way with 16 digs, with Tuileta recording 15 and Christenson adding 13.
Earlier in the season, the Trojans had a similarly dramatic win over BYU, though on a much smaller stage. When BYU came to the Galen Center on Feb. 12 for a two-game trip, USC took the first match in five sets. The Trojans dropped both of the first two sets, but staged a comeback and won the next three, which included a nail-biter of a fifth set (20-25, 21-25, 25-16, 25-23, 16-14).
That win propelled USC back into sole possession of first place in the MPSF standings, but the roughest stretch of the season for the Trojans immediately followed. USC dropped the second match against BYU in four sets (25-20, 25-19, 23-25, 25-19), then lost their next three conference matches, as well as four of their next five.
But now, the Trojans have won eight of their last nine matches, with seven of those wins coming against conference opponents.
The match was also the 10th time the Trojans have gone the distance in a match. USC is now 8-2 in those five-set matches.
“Going into [the fifth set], I knew this is our time,” coach Bill Ferguson said. “The first thing I told them was nobody’s been in more five-set matches this year than us and nobody’s won more five-set matches than us.”
The Trojans will take on No. 2 UC Irvine, the top seed in the MPSF tournament, in the semifinals this Thursday. Irvine took down the Trojans in five sets after dropping the first two sets (20-25, 18-25, 25-19, 25-17, 15-13) at the Galen Center the last time these two teams played on March 3. However, when USC visited Irvine, which will play host to the semifinal, on Jan. 23, the Trojans were victorious in five sets (28-30, 25-17,    21-25, 25-23,15-13).
“Irvine’s an unbelievable team, we’re going to have our hands full,” Ferguson said. “But we are going to be in Irvine, and that’s in the heart of Trojan nation, so it’s a place that we’re comfortable playing.”
The Trojans and the Anteaters are set to start at 7:30 p.m. on April 30. The winner will earn the chance to play for the MPSF’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament on May 2.

Avengers: Age of Ultron has already begun its all-out assault on the box office. It broke $200 million with lightning speed. This has been accomplished — despite the film only being released in the United States on Friday — by releasing the film early in 44 territories around the world. To put it plainly, the film’s success in the United States is only a fraction of the overall equation for big money films.
To find another, perhaps more striking, example of this phenomenon, one has to look no further than this weekend’s box office returns. Furious 7, the adrenaline-soaked car extravaganza has become the fifth highest-grossing movie of all time with a total worldwide gross of $1.32 billion, only $20 million away from surpassing the final Harry Potter movie. Furious 7 has exceeded all expectations, but domestically it has only done really well, sitting at 36th place with $320 million. The domestic gross has only accounted for 24 percent of the overall success of the film.
This is why one can see film series such as Pirates of the Caribbean and Transformers continue on despite relatively disappointing recent domestic performances. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides earned a 33 percent Rotten Tomatoes score and grossed only — “only” is being used in a very relative sense here — $241 million domestically (That is less than My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Maleficent). Worldwide? On Stranger Tides is the fifteenth highest-grossing film of all time at $1.04 billion. Transformers: Age of Extinction’s is a similar story. Last year’s robot-centric “Age of” movie earned 18 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, a 91st domestic ranking with $245 million domestic, but came in at 11th all-time worldwide at $1.09 billion. At 23 percent and 24 percent respectively, those films depended on the U.S. for a fraction of their success.
The big change here is China. The Chinese box office has exploded in recent years. Age of Extinction was, until this last week when Furious 7 passed it, the highest grossing movie ever in China at $320 million. That is $75 million more than it made in the U.S. representing and representing a huge chunk of its worldwide profits. Now, it must be said that, due to China’s strict rules governing its film business, only a fraction of those dollars make it back to the studios who produced the films (Some estimates are as low as 27 cents on the dollar). This, however, is not a deterrent for the studios. Studios are making a strong push into China and Age of Ultron, which will open there on May 12, will be the next movie to push into that market. But, what seems like a forgone conclusion in the states may not be as clear-cut in the foreign market. Ultron might very well fall short of Furious 7 in some areas of the world. In China for example, the only non-Chinese movies to break into the all-time top 10 are James Cameron’s two world beaters Avatar and Titanic, the newly crowned Furious 7 and two Transformers movies. This signals a different sort of market overseas, one that is not governed by our basic assumptions about the stranglehold of superhero movies. For example, Iron Man 3, which made serious waves two years ago for its specific targeting of the Chinese market with added extra scenes and input from Chinese studios, only reached 15th all-time.
O.K., James Cameron’s two box office juggernauts — still the only two films to break $2 billion worldwide — are freaks of nature, Cameron made a deal with some box office demon from whom he gained the power to basically print money with his films. Those anomalies aside, the worldwide market is extremely difficult to predict. At first glance, it seems as if the oft-repeated criticism that big blockbuster films appeal to the least common denominator is only magnified overseas. This line of thinking is straightforward. When films are being translated into other languages and shown to people of different cultures then the most basic story lines will appeal as they will apply to the most people’s perspectives. Essentially, cars flying from one building to another or robot aliens punching robot dinosaurs is a universal language.
This would suggest that the biggest and stupidest films would do the most damage worldwide. And, to a certain extent, this holds true. Furious 7 just became the non James Cameron-directed movie to break a billion overseas and, as previously mentioned, Furious 7 and Age of Extinction are one and two in China’s all-time box office. This theory becomes murkier when one scrolls down the all-time overseas box-office list, however, and sees oddities such as two Ice Age sequels and Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland in the top 20. Clearly things are not so simple overseas. For one reason or another, an animated ground sloth can grab the attention of children worldwide and tilt the box office scales in one direction or another.
So, make no mistake; Age of Ultron will ravage the box office like a bunch of 13th century Mongol horsemen. The first Avengers raked in the third-highest ever box office, and the overseas market has only grown in the last three years. Furious 7 stands no chance against Ultron in the U.S. market, Ultron will likely at least match, if not surpass, its predecessor’s robust $623 million domestic performance. But, overseas, Furious 7 might actually put up quite the fight. It is a testament to whatever strange Cameron-like lightning that Furious 7 has caught in its bottle that this is even the case, but this is a realistic possibility in the landscape in which we live in. Ultron is already a fifth of the way to Furious’s billion with China and Japan still to begin. But a billion dollars is still a billion dollars. There is a reason why only three films have ever reached that benchmark.
Whatever happens, the overseas competition between these two films will be the sort of big stupid underdog behemoth versus even more colossal behemoth battle that would likely bludgeon its way to an impressive overseas box office of its own right.

This past weekend, one of the biggest — if not the biggest — country music festivals took place right in our backyard in Indio, California. The Stagecoach country music festival featured a star-studded lineup to satisfy attendees both young and old.
In addition to the music, the festival boasted a dance hall, giant-sized versions of games such as Jenga and various corporate sponsors. Despite displaying the big corporate names and logos throughout the festival, Stagecoach seems to have made the right decision. Each and every one of the sponsor booths were packed all throughout the festival.
Because Stagecoach is held at the same location as Coachella, one can’t help but make comparisons. The festival grounds were definitely reminiscent of stylish, hipster Coachella. It all seemed familiar, yet couldn’t be more different. What used to be the Sahara tent hosting the biggest names in EDM is now the Palomino stage hosting a variety of acts ranging from Logan Brill to Gregg Allman. Two large outdoor stages at Coachella were replaced with one Toyota Mane Stage with pun intended. This stage featured the festival’s biggest headliners and had seated viewing areas in the back with a bring-your-own-chairs policy. Stagecoach was also considerate enough to leave ample time in between the headliners’ sets to travel over to the other stages as well as to fill up on beer and barbeque. The biggest difference, however, was the family-friendly environment of Stagecoach. It was certainly a different mood, which was very fitting for the festival.
Stagecoach featured a variety of performers throughout the three days. Headliners Tim McGraw, Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton dished out their greatest hits at the Mane Stage to those waving their beers up in the front, and those in lawn chairs with their families in the back. On the opposite end of the festival, the blues guitarists Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill and Frank Beard of ZZ Top packed the Palomino tent to overflowing capacity. In fact, festival-goers had to stand outside the tent to get a glimpse of this incredible trio and their trademark beards.
One standout artist was definitely Jake Owen on the Mane Stage on Friday. Though he had some questionable remixing of hip-hop songs into the country genre, he was definitely having the time of his life on stage. It was evident in his expression, in the way he walked, in the way he played and in the way he sang his music. His smile was non-stop, and his energy roused the crowd more than any other act of the night. Not only was he energetic, but he was also personable with a shout-out to his “mom somewhere out there,” asking his crowd to take good care of her. He even made a trip into the pit to high-five his fans within the first three songs of his set. Though it was the veteran country singer’s first appearance at Stagecoach since its inception in 2007, it will definitely not be his last.
Saturday’s incredible lineup had Dierks Bentley on the Mane Stage just before Lambert. In the middle of his set, he changed it up a little to give a breath of fresh air from non-stop country with his rendition of OneRepublic’s “Counting Stars.” He talked about his 1994 Chevy pickup truck from when he first left for Nashville, which inspired the song “I Hold On.” It was an all-around solid performance from a great artist. Lambert closed out the stage with a well-planned set. It started off with a video of her song, “Somethin’ Bad,” and then another video highlighting the fastest women in sports before she appeared on stage to sing “Fastest Girl in Town.” The clever setup was only the beginning of a set list of songs everybody knew the lyrics to. The hits in her albums did not disappoint as she closed off the second day of Stagecoach.
Sunday featured up-and-coming acts such as Logan Brill, and the most solid Mane Stage lineup of the weekend. The Swon Brother, Jerrod Neimann and The Band Perry preceded a much-awaited performance by Shelton to close out the three-day music festival with more than 200,000 attendees.

On April 16, TIME magazine published its annual “100 Most Influential People In the World.” This year, the covers featured entertainers Kanye West and Bradley Cooper, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, ballet dancer Misty Copeland and news anchor Jorge Ramos. The other 95 honorees include innovators in their respective fields. With a rise of the media’s influence, the terms “popular” and “influential” are being used interchangeably. These two terms, however, are not synonymous. As time goes on, some people’s relevancy on the list will remain questionable. This list put forth by TIME is a proponent of celebrity culture, which glorifies celebrities’ true impact on society.
The list is divided into five sections: titans, pioneers, artists, leaders and icons. TIME stated its criterion for choosing their 100 most influential people each year, saying, “Every year we hope the list will introduce you to influential people you might not have met before. And encourage you to find out more about them.” The magazine, however, also places a well-known celebrity on the cover. These already popular celebrities do not need to be “reintroduced to the public.” TIME also stated that the magazine readership only selects one person, while the magazine selects all other public figures. This collection of honorees indicates what the magazine deems influential as opposed to what the rest of the world does.
Though a majority of the figures on this list are already very well known to the public, it is important to see what others offer in their respective fields to make strides in social justice. Some lesser-known people include feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian, who redefines norms in an area dominated by men. Sarkeesian regularly vocalizes her concern with the  gaming industry, since it falsely depicts the gaming population as more male than female. Without TIME magazine’s recognition, Sarkeesian’s criticism of gender inequality would not be as pertinent in this digital age. The magazine needs to highlight more people like Sarkeesian instead of celebrities like 2014 honoree Miley Cyrus who has not actually inspired substantive change in the world.
Sarkeesian is also one of the 40 women holding a spot on the TIME magazine list this year. In past years, there have been 35 to 40 women on the list. Even though this is an increase, it is still not an accurate representation of the impact female figures have on society.
Also notable are the essays attached to each honoree’s feature. They are almost all penned by other public figures, but if the honorees actually have an immense impact on society, then these essays should be written by regular people. Education activist and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafazai was nominated for the third time this year. Her essay was written by a 16-year-old refugee in Jordan, detailing why Yousafazai is her hero in a place where there is such dim hope. TIME should refine its list by having people tell more of these stories instead of showing six degrees of separation between celebrities.
Ultimately, a new list must be put forward which highlights public figures who strive to better the world and not their own public image. This list should exclusively highlight people, some lesser known, that are questioning norms in their fields. TIME, going forward, should offer a way to put forth a new list, reflecting people who are actually influential.

Dr. Mehmet Oz has drawn recent criticism from others in the scientific community for his unwavering stance on the need to label genetically modified organisms. But he is not alone. Opposition to GMOs finds steadfast, bipartisan consensus in the United States, with a supermajority of Americans consistently expressing their skepticism towards the altered crops. Perhaps America, where diabetes and obesity are prominent diseases, it is heartening to see the public rallying against what it believes to be an affront to health and the food system. Many of the claims deployed by anti-GMO activists, however, are scientifically unfounded, based entirely on anecdotal evidence for which the details are shady, at best. Though there is certainly reason to believe that the corporate cultures of big agricultural companies like Monsanto are of ethical questionability, the consensus on GMOs themselves — the scientific consensus, that is -— posits safety and necessity. As we confront the challenges of a ballooning global population, a loss of arable land, and the effects of climate change, it is important that we use the technologies available to ensure the viability and nutrition of our crops for decades to come.
Scientists first began to develop GMOs — organisms engineered through the combination of genetic material from biologically different parent species — in the 1970s, with genetically modified potatoes, corn and cotton introduced on the market in the mid-1990s.  These early genetically modified crops included genes from a bacterium capable of producing its own insecticide, such that when inserted into the genome of a potato, that potato too would become toxic to insects. Researchers saw great potential for the creation of crops capable of withstanding drought, blight, extreme cold and high salinity. Such feats could yield the elimination of harsh pesticides and fertilizers.
But with this new wave of science came widespread concern over the essentially boundless capacity of scientists to re-engineer life. Opponents have focused their worries primarily on the human health impacts, for which no scientific studies have concluded adverse causalities. Despite this, activists frequently tout a controversial 2012 paper published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology that linked genetically modified corn to cancerous tumors in rats. The journal retracted the paper in 2013 due to weak evidence and poor research methods.
Many in the anti-GMO camp would be quick to label this retraction as just another tactic of the large-scale conspiracy headed by Big Ag to suppress the science tying GMOs to poor health. But even if such a scheme were capable of manipulating the boards of the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Medical Association, the European Commission and England’s Royal Society of Medicine — all of which have concluded a benign, even beneficial impact of GMOs on health — it seems implausible that Big Ag would also be responsible for the verdicts drawn in thousands of independent studies by scientists — that is — GMOs are not dangerous.
Despite the science, many companies have fueled baseless rumors on GMOs by committing to their elimination from store shelves. Whole Foods and Trader Joes are two such companies. Arguably, their decision constitutes a business-savvy pandering to populist misunderstandings. That’s fine. It certainly isn’t the first time business has profited from public ignorance. The problem is that by rejecting GMOs, these companies — which emphasize consumer and environmental health — suggest that GMOs are a threat to these values.
In actuality, GMOs have proven extremely effective at supporting health, particularly in some of the world’s poorest regions. In Southeast Asia, where vitamin A deficiency causes half a million children to go blind (and often die) each year, Golden Rice — a rice strain modified to produce vitamin A — has helped diminish the problem. Elsewhere in the developing world, the use of GMOs will be essential in ensuring that burgeoning populations have access to the needed calories, nutrients and minerals to sustain adequate health.
Meanwhile, on the home front, the GMO war seems a misplaced effort. In a country where obesity, heart disease, overconsumption of refined sugars and an epidemic of inactivity are very real issues, it seems our time could be better spent fighting health hazards for which there is actually a scientific mandate.

Thanks for the laugh,Austin, perhaps comedic writing is in the future for you?
and what of the excessive amount of added roundup to our already heavily laced diets?  regardless of the saftey or not of gmo’s more and more toxins is not acceptable.  when they create a gmo plants that is healthy and can be grown completely organically without added toxins inside or out, then… we can say yes, until then, its no no no to gmo’s
You’re probably talking about glyphosate. Do you believe that glyphosate is applied everyday on the same field?
Enough glyphosate is used so that it has been found in mothers’ breast milk and in our urine.
Where are the studies about this phenomenon? I tried searching PubMed but no studies about the phenomenon appear.
Instead of informing the public Reagan spreads corporate propaganda.
He naively states or believes that there are “thousands of independent studies by scientists” on GMOs failing to understand that we live in a corporatist nation/world, where the medical-pharma-gmo-junk food-federal-industrial complex or cartel rules (read Ghislaine Lanctôt’s “The Medical Mafia,” Marcia Angell’s “The Truth about the Drug Companies” or Peter Gøtzsche’s “Deadly Medicines and Organised Crime”). If you want to know about the industry-government collusion read thru this piece and study the numerous references – google or bing “Tougher Supplement Regulation: A Necessity Or Politics?” Almost all GMO studies are conducted by scientists with conflict of interests, a common feature in medical research.
Reagan is merely another unwitting (or witting?) mouthpiece of the corporate propaganda culture.
Even anti-GMO organic corporations spread their own version of corporate propaganda.
This is a very good article, but I want to point out a needed correction; Golden Rice hasn’t been released to the public yet, so it hasn’t had an impact. I believe it will be a real lifesaver, but only when and IF it’s released and accepted by the people who need it.
Yes, I think that they are holding back trying to get the yield up. The worst thing that they could do is release it prematurely with a lower yield, and feed the non GMO folks more Ammo.
Exactly!
Good luck with that,since they haven’t even been able to produce one variety!
I can’t be sure, but it sounds as if you’re being snarky. Do you actually hope that Golden Rice doesn’t get a chance to help people? At least one variety has been produced. It exists. It just isn’t high yielding enough to substitute for current varieties.  If you’re against Golden Rice, why?

The ‘Golden Rice’ – An Exercise in How Not to Do Science
ISIS-TWN Sustainable Science Audit #1 Evaluating science and technology for sustainability and social accountability
ISIS believes science as much as scientists should be socially and ecologically accountable, and has launched a sustainable science audit project jointly with the Third World NetworkSee also The Golden Rice Scandal UnfoldsThe ‘golden rice’ – a GM rice engineered to produce pro-Vitamin A – is being offered to the Third World as cure for widespread vitamin A deficiency.The audit uncovers fundamental deficiencies in all aspects, from the scientific/social rationale to the science and technology involved. It is being promoted in order to salvage a morally as well as financially bankrupt agricultural biotech industry.The scientific/social rationalization for the project exposes a reductionist self-serving scientific paradigm that fails to see the world beyond its own narrow confines. The ‘golden rice’ is a useless application. Some 70 patents have already been filed on the GM genes and constructs used in making the ‘golden rice’. It is a drain on public resources and a major obstruction to the implementation of sustainable agriculture that can provide the real solutions to world hunger and malnutrition.‘Golden rice’ is not a ‘second generation’ GM crop as has been claimed. It involves standard first generation technology, and carries some of the worst features in terms of hazards to health and biodiversity. Rockefeller Foundation, the major funder of the project by far has withdrawn support from it. The project should be abandoned altogether.Key Words: ‘Golden rice’, vitamin A deficiency, Green Revolution, sustainable science, GM technology, gene patents, GM constructs
A gift-horse for the poor
A report in Financial Times states that the creators of ‘golden rice’ have struck ‘a ground-breaking deal’ with corporate giant AstraZeneca to give Third World farmers free access to the grain while allowing it to be commercially exploited in the developed world. The company will oversee the production of stable GM line(s) and patenting, and take the lines through field trials and commercial approval. While farmers in developed countries will have to pay royalties, those in the Third World earning less than US$10 000 will not. But will Third World farmers be allowed to save the seeds for replanting? It did not say.This ‘golden rice’, not yet available, is already worth its weight in diamonds. The project was funded from four sources of public finance totaling US$100 million: the philanthropic Rockefeller Foundation, whose mission is to support scientific research that specifically benefit the poor, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the European Community Biotech Program and the Swiss Federal Office for Education and Science.The announcement failed to mention that there are already 70 patent claims on the genes, DNA sequences, and gene constructs used to make the golden rice. Will the cost of paying royalties for the previous 70 patent claims be added to the cost of the golden rice? Which of the royalties on the seventy-odd patents would the Third World farmers be absolved from paying? Rockefeller Foundation, the major funder by far, has reportedly abandoned the project to ” shift its agricultural funding focus to support research that will have a more direct benefit to subsistence farmers”
The scientific/social rationale is fallacious
Many have commented on the absurdity of offering ‘golden rice’ as the cure for vitamin A deficiency when there are plenty of alternative, infinitely cheaper sources of vitamin A or pro-vitamin A, such as green vegetables and unpolished rice, which would be rich in other essential vitamins and minerals besides. To offer the poor and malnourished a high-tech ‘golden rice’ tied up in multiple patents, that has cost US$100 million to produce and may cost as much to develop, is worse than telling them to eat cake.‘Golden rice’ was engineered to produce pro-vitamin A or b-carotene (the substance that makes carrots orange) in the endosperm, i.e., the part of the rice grain that remains after it has been polished. The scientific paper started with a review of the literature to rationalize why such GM rice is needed and of benefit for the Third World. The paper was accompanied by an unusually long news feature entitled, ‘The Green Revolution Strikes Gold’, which reinforced the rationalization for the project, explaining the remarkable feat of technology involved and stated that the scientists intend to make the ‘golden rice’ “freely available to the farmers who need it most.” The last sentence in this glowing report, however, gave the game away: “One can only hope that this application of plant genetic engineering to ameliorate human misery without regard to short-term profit will restore this technology to political acceptability.
“What were the reasons for the scientists to embark on the project? It is important to know, as these reasons may have been used to persuade funders to support the project in the first place, and funders ought to bear as much of the responsibility.”GOLDEN RICE IS A FARCE! !!
The “miracle” cure has been “coming soon” for a decade and a half! Jonathan Matthews reports
Charles Margulis of the Centre for Environmental Health has been following the GMO golden rice project for many years and has kept a collection of quotes (listed below), documenting a decade and a half’s worth of failed promises of the crop’s imminent arrival. This has made him wonder whether golden rice should be considered vaporware – something that’s announced with great fanfare to the media and the public but which never actually becomes available.
Patrick Moore offered a glass of glyphosateThe most recent fanfare comes from Patrick Moore (right) – now notorious for the interview in which he refused to drink the Roundup herbicide he claims is safe to drink by the quart! – with his Allow Golden Rice Now campaign. The name of the campaign is itself a lie – the “Now” implies that golden rice is already available for use and that it is a proven “cure” for Vitamin A Deficiency, so all we have to do is remove any unnecessary obstacles. But none of this is true. 
Despite the cover of TIME magazine proclaiming a decade and a half ago, “This rice could save a million kids a year” and the project having been launched as far back as 1985, golden rice still is not ready, as is clear from the revealing collection of quotes below.
And it’s important to emphasise that this delay is entirely down to over-promising and failure to deliver and not, as the likes of Patrick Moore like to claim, due to pushback from golden rice’s critics. The New York Times reporter Amy Harmon, who has reported sympathetically on golden rice, confirms that she has never seen any convincing evidence activism has significantly delayed the production of Golden Rice.
Meanwhile in the Philippines, one of the main target countries for golden rice, dramatic declines in Vitamin A deficiency have been achieved using already available non-GMO methods. And as the final quote below from UNICEF makes plain, methods of tackling VAD have been available throughout the period in which we have been told to imminently expect the arrival of golden rice. 
Imagine if all the multi-million dollar budgets and PR energy that have been lavished on golden rice had gone instead into making these simple proven approaches more widely available. How many children’s lives could have been dramatically improved or saved?
As the World Food Prize winner Hans Herren has lamented, “We already know today that most of the problems that are to be addressed via golden rice and other GMOs can be resolved in a matter of days, with the right political will.”
Finally, this excellent video shows how people in the Philippines are responding critically to golden rice. 
Isn’t it about time politicians and the mainstream media started listening to voices like theirs, rather than to GMO lobbyists like Patrick Moore and their vaporware promises?

Quotes on GMO Golden Rice: 15 years of failure
Collected by Charles Margulis (@kvetchinguru on Twitter) – edits/additions by GMWatch
Aug 2000
AstraZeneca [now Syngenta] speculates that it “could have vitamin A rice in farmers’ fields as early as 2003.”
Nov 2000
“If everything goes well, within two to three years, golden rice varieties will be made available free to farmers earning less than $10,000 a year from the crop.”
Feb 2003
“When Golden Rice finally gets a commercial release in 2007, it will come free to all those in the developing countries who earn less than $10,000 a year.”
2005
“Before the second generation of golden rice [the first never emerged] is commercially produced, it must first be approved by the countries where it is to be planted, which could take several more years.”
“Syngenta is making the rice available for free to research centres across Asia, who will, if they are given the go-ahead by their governments, begin field trials – probably within the next five years.”
2008
“Golden rice is likely to be permitted between years 2011 and 2012 should field tests yield positive results.”
“It was supposed to prevent blindness and death from vitamin A deficiency in millions of children. But almost a decade after its invention, golden rice is still stuck in the lab… The first field trial of golden rice in Asia started only this month. Its potential to prevent the ravages of vitamin A deficiency has yet to be tested, and even by the most optimistic projections, no farmer will plant the rice before 2011.”
2013
“Scientists say they have seen the future of genetically modified foods… In a few months, golden rice – normal rice that has been genetically modified to provide vitamin A to counter blindness and other diseases in children in the developing world – will be given to farmers in the Philippines for planting in paddy fields. Thirty years after scientists first revealed they had created the world’s first GM crop, hopes that their potential to ease global malnutrition problems may be realised at last.”
“This article [see quote above] was amended on 13 March 2013. Originally it said that golden rice would be given to farmers in the Philippines “in a few months”. It is still undergoing a registration process and may not be released until next year at the earliest.”
2014
“The first round of MLTs [multi-location field trials] was conducted … in 2012-13 to assess how well this version of Golden Rice would perform in different locations in the Philippines. Preliminary results were mixed… The initial results indicate that more research is needed, with greater focus on increasing yield… the developments described above will result in a delay in the timeline.”
“Golden Rice will only be made broadly available to farmers and consumers if it is: (a) successfully developed into rice varieties that retain the same yield, pest resistance, and grain quality – agronomic and eating traits acceptable to farmers and consumers – as current popular rice varieties; (b) deemed safe and approved by national regulators; and (c) shown to improve vitamin A status under community conditions.”
UNICEF (2001)
“Delivery of two high-dose vitamin A capsules a year to children under five prevents vitamin A deficiency.” http://gmwatch(dot)org/index(dot)php/news/archive/2015-articles/16043-golden-rice-is-it-vaporware
