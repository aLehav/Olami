The Good, the Bad, the Weird really moves. Oozing style from every frame, Kim Jee-woon’s Korean western starts with a thrilling train robbery in Japanese-occupied China and rarely slows down. Here is a film that understands the simple pleasure of a moving camera and moving characters.

Kim’s movie is an absurd, gorgeous mash-up of Western and Eastern iconography: deadeye Koreans in cowboy hats, Chinese ghost towns and a roaring Gatling gun.
Bounty hunter Du-won (Jung Woo-sung), “the Good,” forms an uneasy partnership with “the Weird,” Tae-goo (Song Kang-ho), an amoral bandit looking for a legendary Chinese treasure trove. “The Bad,” gang leader Chang-yi (Lee Byung-hun), seeks both the map to the treasure and revenge on Tae-goo.
Almost inevitably, the good character becomes lost against his more engaging counterparts. Byung-hun — tragically best known to Americans for his turn as evil ninja Storm Shadow in G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra — plays Chang-yi over the top, with a vicious style to match his menacing and carefully put together hairdo. Dressed in black from head to toe and never without a cold sneer, Chang-yi epitomizes the tone and style of Kim’s movie: cool on a plane that most pastiche pieces never quite reach. The chubby, crazy-eyed Kang-ho, who has played variations of “the Weird” in films like Bong Joon-ho’s The Host or Park Chan-wook’s Thirst, steals his scenes with an effortlessness that has defined his career.
One thing to appreciate about Kim’s films compared to other Korean action movies is his almost-American obsession with the power of the gun. His excellent A Bittersweet Life riffed on the normally martial arts-based Korean gangster genre by letting its protagonist bring a gun to a knife fight. The Good, the Bad, the Weird takes his fetish to a further extreme, seriously challenging the classic Golan-Globus American action movies from the Reagan era for the “most bullets expended over 120 minutes” world record.
Kim calls The Good, the Bad, the Weird an “Oriental western,” an emerging subgenre pioneered by Asian directors with roots in Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood pictures. Takashi Miike made a truly bizarre take on Akira Kurosawa’s western-inspired Yojimbo in Sukiyaki Western Django, but where that film felt like homage without much new to say, Kim’s version really strives to reinvent the classically American genre with the sensibilities of a modern Korean action movie.
The Japanese occupation of Northern China in the ’30s is as close as East Asia gets to a Wild West. In focusing on Korean immigrants fighting Japanese soldiers, Chinese bandits and each other, The Good, the Bad, the Weird is ripe for political analysis, but Kim’s film is so stylized and frantic that it resists such readings.
Even just 80 years removed from that dark history, still very much an open wound on the collective East Asian psyche, Kim’s Manchuria feels like a mythic setting, a world as far removed from reality as the Texas-Mexico border in Leone or Sam Peckinpah’s films.
The production design deserves special mention — the film was made inexpensively by American standards but the worlds it creates through digital effects and traditional sets flow together almost seamlessly into a fantastic vision of a ’30s China that never existed.
Kim’s reference-heavy old-becomes-new style demands comparison to the last decade of Quentin Tarantino’s work; the director even uses Chingon’s “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood” and some Ennio Morricone samples to the same effect Tarantino uses in his Kill Bill movies. Kim cares much less about dialogue than the often self-indulgent QT, and The Good, the Bad, the Weird feels much leaner than Tarantino’s bloated recent work.
Putting plot and character second to action finally catches up to Kim in a final showdown predicated on some poorly telegraphed plot twists, which carries less dramatic heft than it could otherwise, but the film earns a rare pass in putting style over substance.
The plot also sags terribly when it slows down even briefly, but while such pauses are necessary for any coherent action picture, Kim fails to handle them in an interesting manner.
As in his previous work, Kim’s senses as an action director are strangely flawed. The staging becomes so cluttered and the camera becomes so delirious with movement that scenes sometimes lose their sense of direction. A climactic desert chase featuring dozens of pursuers after the heroes runs so long and features so many changes of direction by the camera and characters that trying to follow it logically becomes an exercise in frustration.
But individual images from Kim’s relentless bombardment of action choreography stand out as better than their sum — try and find a cooler moment in any action movie this year than the rifle-bearing Du-won turning his horse around and riding into the pursuing Japanese army.

I got the title for my Internet-themed column from ex-Senator Ted Stevens’ comments on net neutrality. In 2006, Stevens mixed up the words “Internet” and “e-mail,” and then gave an incorrect account of how e-mail traffic works, saying that “[the Internet is] not a big truck — it’s a series of tubes.”
It seemed at the time like nothing more than a humorous insight into how little the people in charge of Internet regulation actually knew about the web, but it had a larger implication — the marginalization of the Internet and online culture in general.
At the time that Stevens made those remarks, social media had not yet broken into Tweet-mania, ownership of Internet-enabled phones was limited to Wall Street’s finest and many people still did not recognize the power of the Internet. As a fan of the Internet and Internet culture, this left me a little jaded.
Since I started writing this column, I’ve seen the Internet go from being perceived as a passing trend to being recognized as a major part of life. Whereas a few years ago being tech-savvy was considered geeky and looked down on, now it is a skill everyone either has or is gaining through everyday life. Why the change, and what does this mean for us?
Part of this shift is simply because of the technological boom of the last few years. Laptops became sleeker and more convenient. Smart phones suddenly gave the Internet an ultra-portable system.
Facebook and Twitter exploded in popularity, getting people, who normally would not use the Internet to connect with others, to go online. Add in the rise of media sites like YouTube and Hulu and the Internet suddenly became unavoidable.
The boom made the Internet so mainstream that it is now ingrained in everyday life.
There is a great quote from the television show Leverage: “Age of the geek, baby.” And the way online resources are being used today, it certainly applies.
People use e-mail more than snail mail — it is quick, easy and there is less chance of paper cuts. In business, the Internet has streamlined communication, organization and productivity.
More and more companies are using its resources as part of their business models, and some of the largest companies in the last decade are ones that work within the field, such as Google and Amazon.
Even politics have been shaped by the Internet, and politicians now embrace it as a means to success. President Obama’s campaign was a turning point for online political activism, allowing a localized center to organize rallies, raise money and communicate on a national level with ease. Now it is the model for every 21st century campaign, with every candidate focusing heavily on their online division.
The Internet, as the old saying goes, has made the world smaller. We are interconnected at a level unheard of in recent times. A simple video posted online can spread instantly and create a new meme or create a global protest against some act of brutality.
Recently, the Internet became a tool for a task that would have been unheard of a few years ago — running a country. Stranded in New York by the ash cloud covering Europe, Norway’s Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg was able to electronically govern his nation through his iPad. While he might not have been physically interacting with his staff, he still had full access and communication with them — all through the Internet.
This rise of Internet legitimacy puts us in an interesting spot. We are a part of a generation that grew up at the same time as the Internet. All of the big trends that have emerged happened as we came into adulthood and the next generation will already have these in place.
Whether this is a good or bad thing is up in the air, but they will be a whole new kind of technological user, with different habits and understandings of the Internet.
It is clear now that the web isn’t some fad or passing trend. It is tied to business, communication and our daily lives. The Internet is already an institution, and it is here to stay. It’s more than a series of tubes, Ted Stevens, it’s our lives.

Upon hearing that Peter Buffett — son of American investor Warren Buffett — wrote a motivational book entitled Life is What You Make It, your first question might be: What hard life experiences did the son of a billionaire go through that would inspire him to write a self-help book? The answer, in short, is none.
After growing up modestly in Omaha, Neb., Buffett attended Stanford — thanks to a recommendation letter from the publisher of The Washington Post — before dropping out to pursue a career in music.
Now a composer with numerous television scores — two of which earned him Emmys — and a solo album under his belt, Buffett decied to share his experience.
It must first be noted that this book is wrongly being touted as appropriate for teenagers and college-age adults.
Because most of Life Is What You Make It is a handbook for affluent parents who do not want to raise spoiled kids, the book instead speaks to members of the upper middle class who have or are considering having children.
When Buffett is not giving unsupported child-rearing advice, he is abundantly extolling the wonderful upbringing he received from his parents.
This seems dishonest, however, since he fails to mention the fact that in 1977 his parents stopped living together — though remained married until his mother’s death in 2004 — and in 2006, his father re-married to the woman with whom he had been living since the 1977 separation.
Furthermore, there is no mention of Warren’s having disowned Peter’s adopted daughter, artist Nicole Buffett (the child of his first wife), after she appeared in the documentary The One Percent, which was about the country’s gap between rich and poor.
Nevertheless, Buffett’s book talks a great deal about his inspirational upbringing, which he thinks other parents should emulate.
For instance, as a child, his family often hosted exchange students from multiple countries. His mother was an active member of his education, often sitting in on his classes just so she could be involved. She even took him to what he considered to be the “bad” and “poor” parts of Omaha so that he could see that these people had “the same blood running through their veins and love in their hearts.”
Buffett does not seem to understand how lucky he was that his family could afford to have extra visitors staying in the house for fun. Nor does he realize that most parents want to be involved in their children’s lives but simply can’t because they work one or more jobs.
Again and again Buffett repeats his tenet that we should do what makes us happy in life and not be concerned about the paycheck.
Clearly this is because he never had to be concerned about the paycheck. Even if he never received a large trust fund, he certainly never had to be concerned about having food or shelter.
Thankfully, Peter does admit he is not perfect.
One of the biggest mistakes he  says he ever made in life was buying a house that was too big. Not that he ended up on the streets because of it — it was just another experience he had to learn from.
Like most of his mistakes, experiences and lessons, the general population can only hope in another lifetime to experience them.
If your last name is Gates, or you come from similar wealth and plan on raising children, then this book is for you. You will learn how to teach your children the value of a dollar and how to let them follow their dreams.
For Buffett, it seems one of the worst things a parent can do is force his or her child to be a lawyer or doctor. The child probably wants to be an artist and you should let him or her do that, unless of course your name is Nicole Buffett and then you will be disowned.
But if you fall under the heading of middle class, your time is best spent reading elsewhere.
Despite his parent’s best efforts, Peter Buffett is just another spoiled rich kid with a publishing deal.

When booking acts for its less-than-coveted Tuesday evening slots, The Echo apparently holds itself to less rigid standards of lineup cohesiveness. And though it might be hard to draw a line of best fit between France’s Tahiti Boy and the Palmtree Family, British rock outfit 22-20s and former-film-actress-turned-consummate-live-musician Juliette Lewis, Tuesday’s show at The Echo exhibited an organic progression from one act to the next that no one could have expected.
Other sister · Juliette Lewis headlined The Echo Tuesday over France’s Tahiti Boy and the Palmtree Family and England’s 22-20s. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Though the four members of Tahiti Boy and the Palmtree Family began their set more than half an hour after doors opened at 8:30 p.m., they played most of their songs to a crowd that — although visibly receptive to the group’s performance —  still had a lot of bulking up left to do. By the end of the night, the tiny Echo Park venue would be packed to capacity with Juliette Lewis fans of all kinds, but most of those fans had yet to show up when the four started their whimsical rock set.
But the band embraced the intimacy of its performance; electric pianist and vocalist Tahiti Boy — he appears to go by nothing else — sat contentedly on an upturned milk crate for the duration of the group’s set, and members of the group individually engaged the audience, mouthing pleas to implore various acts of audience participation like clapping.
A high point in the set came when the entire band moved to the front of the stage to lead the audience in a rousing few lines of mob vocals. Despite clear unfamiliarity on the part of the audience with any of the group’s material, it was a credit to the band and its onstage charisma that more than a few people in the crowd were clearly doing their best to learn the lyrics on the spot.
English four-piece 22-20s, 75 percent of which elected to go the leather jacket route when dressing for the night’s performance, took the stage a quarter after 10 p.m. to greet a significantly larger crowd.
Headed up by singer-guitarist Martin Trimble, 22-20s is currently touring the United States in support of its recently released live EP, Latest Heartbreak. In its current manifestation, the band retains three members predating its dissolution in 2006: Trimble, drummer James Irving and bassist Glen Bartup.
Powerful, aggressive string work characterized 22-20s’ entire set. Trimble, Bartup and guitarist Dan Hare’s arrangement — clustered close together near the front of the stage — contributed to the sensation that the band was leading a charge against the audience, actively seeking to flatten the concertgoers with its deafening wall of sound.
The set’s loud parts were loud, the soft parts were also loud, and by the end of 22-20s’ performance, anyone with sense was frightened by Bartup’s bass guitar. But the group’s power was far from unrestrained. On the contrary, 22-20s presented one of the most controlled sets that has probably ever graced The Echo. Sometimes Irving’s percussion even felt incidental to the driving pace set by the two guitar parts and Bartup’s reverb-heavy bass lines.
Despite Trimble’s curt frontman persona — a shame, given his knee-weakening patently British inflection — 22-20s’ incredible sonic power spoke for itself.
By the time headliner Juliette Lewis took the stage, The Echo was probably only one or two heads away from drawing the attention of the local fire marshal.
Lewis, at one time best known for her roles in films like What’s Eating Gilbert Grape and The Other Sister, is now a rocker, through and through. Though no longer a part of The Licks since 2009, she now performs and records with an inconsequential backup band called The New Romantiques.
In her incredibly high-energy set, Lewis wove through songs that, with a few announced exceptions, were familiar to her dedicated, feather headdress-wearing fan base.
Sporting skin-tight satin bellbottoms and some sort of shawl that resembled a freshly slain raven, Lewis tore through more than an hour worth of material, all the while thrashing around on stage like a Greek oracle on a wicked drug trip.
Though established fans probably knew precisely what to expect when they came out to The Echo Tuesday night, concertgoers unfamiliar with Lewis’ music were probably caught off guard to hear the former film star’s vocals, staggeringly powerful and surprisingly controlled.
In every respect, Lewis showed herself to be a consummate musician. For all her ethereal, Stevie Nicks-esque posturings, Lewis was as far from out of it: By whispering suggestions between songs that prompted her bandmates to adjust the frets on their guitars or start drumming their bongos with fingertips rather than maracas, Lewis let slip her intense consciousness of all aspects of her stage performance and revealed herself to be, if not a control freak, an exacting perfectionist, at the very least.
Lewis’ interactions with the sizeable crowd was indicative of the singer’s deep affection for her fans. Constantly leaning into the front rows — she leapt onto the floor at one point and put herself at the mercy of the throngs of rabid fans who seemed thrilled to just be dancing with her — and exaggerating each word of her vivid musical narratives with her pouty, expressive lips, Lewis’ set was very much for the fans.
In a surprise for the ages, The Echo’s unlikely Tuesday lineup — bringing together as it did three acts from three different nations playing three different subgenres of rock — made for a nice musical interlude.

One of the most simultaneously frustrating yet promising aspects of USC is that it is a school perpetually under construction.
Construction is underway at seemingly every turn of the campus. Given all the upheaval in the last four years, orange cones and yellow tape should be the official crest of the graduating class of 2010.
It’s nearly impossible to catalogue all the changes made during that time span. The athletic department alone has been yanked in every direction.
Up went the Galen Center. Down came self-imposed sanctions. Out went Pete Carroll. And still hovering somewhere in the air are the NCAA’s findings on USC and a possible punishment.
Change is almost always unwelcome in sports, especially when things are going well. No one on the home team wants to see the star player leave or the coach take a new job.
Even for seniors who have learned to adapt to the school’s radical transformations, the thought of the uncertainty brought about by graduation is intimidating. I have learned in my time here that reform will go on, no matter our attitude toward it. But if you concede a lack of control to a dynamic world, you’ll at least get an amazing ride.
Coming from a small private high school outside Washington, D.C., I knew I wanted to make a big change in my life. Most of my classmates went to liberal arts schools, whose football teams’ existence was either ironic or for performance art. Coming to USC would either be an incredible experience or an unmitigated disaster.
But it never takes long for a freshman to see how everything is evolving because this is a communal experience. My favorite example of this was packing into the student section of the Galen Center for the men’s basketball team’s first game in the new arena. The Trojans lost that game, but fans chanted the name “O.J. Mayo,” even though the program’s alleged savior was only a high school senior at the time.
I wonder if the fans would have shown him the same adulation if they knew what kind of mark he would leave on the school just two years later.
Working for the Daily Trojan has been the best exercise in coping with uncertainty. As a writer, you are beholden to the facts, and the universe does not care about your deadline.
The games that are close, changing until the last minute, are the most frustrating but also the most memorable. Last fall at Notre Dame, I remember frantically leading a pack of sportswriters running down the stadium stairs to get onto the field for the end of the game. All the while I wondered, “What the hell am I going to write?”
But even in the most frantic times, there’s a brief moment of lucidity where you get to sit back and just watch. If you remember this instead of panicking during hectic times, you’ll get to see something incredible.
Of course, everyone handles change differently. Given the job market, many are understandably apprehensive of leaving the cocoon. But right now, I don’t like to think of myself as unemployed; “unrestricted free agent” is a more apt term.
The best lesson that USC sports have provided is that reform is best embraced as a team.
The Daily Trojan has given me a group of friends, especially in the sports department, undergoing the same daily struggle that I face. I can only hope everyone else has a group that can even compare to the one I have had for the last four years.
People ask constantly about what the school will be like in the future. USC has torn down so much of what used to be — in some manners, it’s hardly recognizable. But I can’t wait to see what the school starts up in the future.
Thinking about all of this took me back to Pete Carroll’s last press conference. Addressing a legion of diehards who only wanted to keep the status quo, he articulated why everyone had to move forward.
“I know that our fans want to know why it can’t keep on going,” Carroll said. “It can’t keep on going because of this opportunity that just came up.”
I like to think a similar sentiment applies to the class of 2010. We can’t keep on going here forever, but there’s an exciting opportunity waiting.
Even if we can’t see it right now.

Terrific article. And welcome, indeed, to the real world full of idiots like the two previous commenters, who can’t string together a post, much less an article of this calibre. Remember that for every opportunity, there’s two layabout know-nothings standing in your way. Godspeed to you and stay strong.
Are you writing about the athletic department… or the DT… or the university construction… or your experiences over the last 4 years? “Change” is a horrible topic to espouse on. And if you are going to anyway, don’t switch from topic to topic every sentence like you do you here. Being abstract and esoteric (like mentioned above) does not make “good” writing.
Your esoteric wriitng does nt resonate to the masses.  Need to be less abstract and obtuse.  Never sure where you are going with your stories or what you are really saying!

USC coach Jovan Vavic and the USC women’s water polo team enter this weekend’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation postseason play ranked second in the nation. After spending the previous two months as the country’s top team, the amount of pressure on their shoulders hasn’t changed — for better or worse.
Big test  · Senior utility Forel Davies and the Women of Troy will be faced with a tough MPSF tournament when they travel to Spieker Aquatic Center on UCLA’s campus. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
When now-No. 1 Stanford topped the Women of Troy 7-6 in overtime Saturday, the Cardinal knocked USC from its perch atop the water polo world. The Women of Troy had won 19 consecutive matches before the game. But the players still expect their opponents to approach them as if they had never lost.
“We’ve been a target throughout the season and will remain one,” said senior two-meter Kami Craig, the team captain. “I believe we’ll stand up to that challenge.”
The Women of Troy — defending MPSF champions — will make the short trip to UCLA’s Spieker Aquatic Center from Friday through Sunday. The opening round in the eight-team tournament will pit them against seventh-seeded San Diego State in a 10 a.m. Friday match-up. A win in that game would propel them into the semifinals against either No. 3 seed California or No. 6 seed San Jose State on Saturday. The championship game will be held Sunday, and the winner will get an automatic bid to the NCAA championships.
Vavic made clear that his team did not execute its game plan against Stanford, as the Trojans squandered many opportunities to put the Cardinal away. Vavic told his players that they were neither outcoached nor bested by a more talented squad — they were just unfocused and unprepared for Stanford’s intensity.
“Our overall focus on the game was bad,” Craig said. “We need to be better on transition defense. Offensively, we need to finish opportunities when we create them. They came out with more intensity this time because they wanted to impress their fans on their Senior Day.”
Although the Cardinal and Women of Troy draw much of the attention in the MPSF tournament, there are other teams hungry to knock off these two behemoths. The No. 13 Aztecs competed with USC in March but fell 9-4; the Women of Troy outscored Cal 17-9 in two matches and San Jose State 13-6 in February but couldn’t blow either team out.
“We can’t overlook anyone — Cal, Hawai’i, UCLA,” Craig said. “When it comes down to it, it’s anyone’s games. Teams have nothing to lose, so they go for it.”

The USC women’s golf team will compete in Indiana from May 6 to 8 in an attempt to qualify for its 13th consecutive NCAA championship appearance.
The team must place in the top eight at the NCAA Championships Central Regional at the Otter Creek Golf Course in Columbia, Ind., in order to advance. In the last four years, the No. 4 Women of Troy have had three victories and a third place finish at their regional competition, and they look to continue that streak of success this year.

Leading the team is sophomore Jennifer Song, the No. 2 golfer in the country, who was named to the All-Pac-10 first team last week. Song finished third at last week’s Pac-10 championship and is looking to close her college career with a national championship. Song plans to turn pro after the season.
She is on pace to break her own USC record for single season scoring average, shooting more than half a stroke better than she did as a freshman, and she already holds the USC record for most career rounds in the 60s, with 14. Song has six top-10 finishes in seven tournaments this year, as well as two victories. She said she thinks that she is in good shape to compete this week.
“Putting and short game-wise, I’ve never been better,” Song said.
Junior Lizette Salas, who was also named to the All-Pac-10 first team, has had four top-six finishes this season. Salas, the No. 16 golfer in the country, is looking for her second victory of the season this week on the way to the national championship.
Senior Belen Mozo, who was named to the Pac-10 honorable mention team, is competing in her fourth and final NCAA regional tournament. Having been a part of two previous regional victories and last season’s third place finish, Mozo is well aware of the pressure on the team but thinks the team is ready.
“We need these ups and downs, and last week’s [ fourth place] finish at the Pac-10 championships was definitely a down, because then we practice things we don’t when we win” Mozo said.
Freshman Cyna Rodriguez is competing in her first regional tournament. She was also named to the honorable mention All-Pac-10 team in her first season at USC, and looks to continue contributing throughout the remainder of the postseason, having had her best finish of the season at the Pac-10 championships.
Rounding out the Women of Troy’s roster this week is sophomore Inah Park. Though she has not competed since the Bruin Wave Invitational in early March, she earned the roster spot over seniors Caroline Kim and Stefanie Endstrasser through competitions in practice.
Though the Women of Troy have to travel to their regional, they’ll be hitting familiar competition. Joining USC in Indiana is No. 2 Arizona State, whom the Women of Troy have battled all year, No. 7 Purdue, No. 13 Michigan State, No. 14 Georgia and No. 16 Denver.
“I think it’ll be a good regional,” said USC coach Andrea Gaston. “The second tier of teams there is strong.”
With a top-eight finish out of 24, the Women of Troy will advance to the NCAA national championship tournament, held at the Country Club of Landfall in Wilmington, N.C., for the chance to compete for their third national title in a decade.

For members of the USC track and field team, the meet the Trojans have been waiting for all season has finally arrived.
The Trojans will face off against UCLA on Saturday at Drake Stadium in Westwood, Calif., in the 77th annual dual meet, with the USC men’s team leading the series 41-35, while the women’s team is at a 5-21 deficit.
The two teams will go head-to-head for the first time since USC swept the dual meet last year at the Katherine B. Loker Stadium.
In last year’s edition of the dual meet, the Trojans topped the Bruins in both the women’s and men’s events.
“Our expectation coming into the season is to win the dual meet,” USC coach Ron Allice said at the outset of the outdoor season. “Everything we do is building up to that meet.”
Last season, the dual meet between USC and UCLA turned out to be the deciding factor in the Gauntlet Trophy, the annual all-sport competition between USC and UCLA. Several Trojans will try to build on strong performances at last year’s dual meet, while others attempt to rebound from tough appearances. Senior Ahmad Rashad will look to make up for his false start and disqualification in last year’s 100-meter dash.
Senior Nate Anderson and sophomores Duane Walker and Joey Hughes will return to the dual meet after helping clinch last year’s contest as members of the men’s 4×400-meter relay team.
For the USC women, junior Zsofia Erdelyi will try and duplicate her terrific performance from 2009, where she won the women’s 5,000-meter and 1,500-meter runs.
USC is also hoping for strong races from season-long stalwarts like senior hurdler Shalina Clarke and senior sprinter Elizabeth Olear, both of whom have posted times in their respective events that rank among the best in the nation.
For USC, the meet will be a chance to prove its strength before heading into what Allice termed “championship time.”
Following the dual meet, the Trojans will compete in the Pac-10 championships and the NCAA championships to close out the 2010 track season.

The regular season might be over, but the USC women’s tennis team is not satisfied ending the season just yet.
Despite losing a few crucial matches, the No. 20 Women of Troy (13-9, 5-3) remain poised as they prepare for their 19th consecutive appearance in the NCAA women’s tennis championships next month.
“For these next few weeks, we’re just trying to get in the best shape possible by doing extra fitness and building our level of confidence,” junior Cristala Andrews said.
Last year, the Women of Troy finished 21-3 overall and went undefeated in Pac-10 play. But the former USC’s No. 1 doubles team graduated from their roster in 2009, and this year proved to be a different story for the Women of Troy.
Though USC began the season notched as the No. 9 seed, USC’s ranking bounced around frequently hitting its lowest at No. 21 in the latter part of the season.
Throughout the season, USC battled trying to figure out the best possible doubles lineup. Overall this season, USC was 13-1 when the Trojans won the doubles point and 0-8 when losing the doubles point in dual-match play.
“This season, we struggled to create a strong doubles line up, causing us to lose the doubles point a lot,” said junior Maria Sanchez.
Sanchez is nationally ranked No. 3 in singles with a 19-3 singles record this season.
“We lost so many of our toughest matches where the doubles point could have made the difference,” Sanchez said.
USC lost three of its matches by 4-3 to some of its biggest Pac-10 foes: Arizona State, UCLA and Stanford. If the Trojans had won the doubles point against all of those teams, their season might have had a different feeling.
“So far, we haven’t had the results we were expecting to get, but we know that we are a very talented team,” freshman Valeria Pulido said. “Right now we see the NCAA competition as a challenge, as well as a chance to really prove ourselves.”
For now, USC has its doubles lineup secured and ready to compete at the NCAA’s.
Sanchez and freshman Danielle Lao, who are also ranked nationally at No. 65 in this week’s Intercollegiate Tennis Assocation rankings, lead the way at the top doubles position. At No. 2 is sophomore Alison Ramos and Pulido, followed by the No. 3 duo of senior Sarah Fansler and junior Lyndsay Kinstler.
“We’re just going to head into our matches with a clean slate, forgetting about previous disappointing matches,” Sanchez said. “We have to go in playing with a lot of energy and knowing we are the better team.”
The NCAA tournament begins May 14 with regional play, after which teams move on to Athens, Ga., from the round of 16 on.

Playing on one of the toughest fields in the country in hot and dry desert conditions, the No. 10 USC men’s golf team finished in third place at this week’s Pac-10 championships in Tempe, Ariz.
Consistent · Junior Matthew Giles finished the Pac-10 tournament at 8-under-par, good enough to finish in a tie for 10th place. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
The Trojans closed with a strong final round of four under par Wednesday, helping them jump up two places on the leader board after entering the day in fifth.
USC, which ended the week at 24 under-par, finished well back of newly crowned Pac-10 champion                     No. 4 Washington (-37) and runner up No. 3 Stanford (-34).
“It’s kind of a similar story to the last few events,” junior Matthew Giles said. “Close [to winning] but just not quite there right now. But it’s coming around.”
Eric Mina of California won the individual Pac-10 championship with a four round total of 16 under par.
Giles led the Trojans, shooting a consistent 68-70-70-68 to finish the tournament at eight under par, good for a tie for 10th place.
“I played pretty solidly all week and hit the ball quite well,” Giles said.
Freshman T.J. Vogel had a great start to the tournament, sitting in fifth place after his opening three rounds of 65-70-67. Vogel struggled in Wednesday’s final round, however, shooting 78 and falling into a tie for 16th at 4 under par.
“He played great leading up to today,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “He got off to a rough start today and couldn’t recover. But he’ll bounce back. He’s too good not to.”
Freshman Sam Smith, playing in his first tournament for USC in nearly two months, performed well, carding 68-74-71-69 to finish tied for 20th at two under par.
“He put up some good rounds for us,” Giles said. “Especially today, when we really needed it.”
Sophomore Steve Lim finished one shot behind Smith, shooting 69-69-73-72 and putting him in a tie for 26th.
Freshman Martin Trainer shot 70-66-78-70 to finish at even par for the tournament and tied for 28th place.
“It was perfect scoring conditions,” Trainer said of the course and the weather. “I’m hitting the ball so much better than I’m scoring right now. I really should be doing a lot better.”
Stewart Hagestad, the fourth freshman competing for a young USC squad at the tournament, struggled with his game and shot 74-81-75-72 to finish in 59th place at 18-over-par.
USC will tee it up next in one of six NCAA Regional Championships to be held May 20 to 22.
If they finish among the top five teams in their region, the Trojans will play for the national championship June 1 to 6 in Chattanooga, Tenn.
“We just need to be more consistent,” Trainer said. “We have the game to be the best team in the country.”
Last season, USC lost to Michigan in the quarterfinals of match play at the NCAA championship.
“We probably haven’t been good enough to win a bunch of times,” Zambri said about his team this season. “But we have two of the biggest and best events left, and we’re getting better all the time, so we’ve got a chance to win a national title still.”

The 2010 college baseball regular season ends May 30 for USC. If the Trojans want to play ball in June, they’ll have to find their stride and turn things around.
Doing so will not be easy.
Matching up · Sophomore Chad Smith and the USC pitching staff have struggled to keep pace with the rest of the Pac-10 this season. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
USC (17-23, 3-12) is in last place in the conference, and eight games behind the leader, Arizona State. The Trojans have just 12 conference games remaining on their schedule to make up the deficit.
Tomorrow No. 17 Arizona comes to Dedeaux Field for a three-game series. The Wildcats are 28-11 on the season and 8-7 in the stacked Pac-10 conference.
They trail the Sun Devils by three games.
Every game the Trojans plays for the rest of the season — 20 in all — will come against a team that currently has a winning overall record.
The Trojans have three conference series remaining after this weekend’s games against Arizona. They play at No. 5 UCLA (30-7, 7-5) on May 14 to 16 and at Washington State (21-15, 5-7) on May 21 to 23.
USC closes the regular season at home against Washington (21-19, 5-7) on May 28 to 30.
The Trojans travel to Irvine on Tuesday to take on the Anteaters (24-14). The two teams will meet again 21 days later at Dedeaux Field.
UCI has won 10 of the last 11 matchups between the two teams dating back to 2004.
The Trojans will host Utah in a nonconference series at Dedeaux Field on May 7 to 9. The Utes are 19-18, and will be well-tested after a three-game series against No. 11 TCU.
Utah leads the all-time series 6-0, with the last game being played at Dedeaux Field in 1971.
The Trojans host Long Beach State (19-18) three days after the Utah series concludes. USC beat the Dirtbags 10-5 on March 2.
The last nonconference series of the year will be against New Mexico State, a two-game series on May 18 to 19. The Aggies are 31-12-1, and have lost just twice since March 20.
USC will have to rely on the bats of two sophomores, infielders Ricky Oropesa and Matt Foat, and junior infielder Joe De Pinto.
Oropesa leads the team in home runs (11) and RBI (40), with Foat second in RBI (30). De Pinto leads the team in runs scored, with 36.
Together, the trio has scored 90 runs ­— accounting for just over 42 percent of USC’s total run production for the season.
On the hill, USC has had its share of struggles. Sophomore starter Ben Mount has been solid for most of the season, pitching to a 3-3 record and a 3.38 ERA.
But sophomore starter Andrew Triggs has had a tough season. He’s 1-7 with a 4.38 ERA. Senior starter Kevin Couture is 2-2 with an ERA of 7.63.
USC’s team ERA is third worst in the conference, and opponents are hitting .289 against Trojan pitching — the second highest average in the Pac-10.
Three of the four conference teams remaining on the schedule — UCLA, Arizona and Washington State — have higher team batting averages and lower team ERAs.
Only Washington is ranked lower than USC in both categories.
The season ends this weekend realistically unless the team can sweep Arizona. That only keeps them alive for the next challenge. Need to change coaches on June 1st and begin a real search for someone who can turn this program around to where it was in the early 2000’s.

After claiming a share of the Pac-10 regular season title and winning the Pac-10 tournament crown, the No. 5 USC men’s tennis team has one more goal to accomplish — repeat as NCAA champions.
Defenders · Freshman J.T. Sundling, who won the Pac-10 Invitational Singles Tournament last week, will try to help the Trojans win a second straight NCAA championship. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
All season, the Trojans have been geared to prepare for the NCAA Championships, which begin May 14th. The Trojans (19-3, 5-1) will be hosting the first two rounds, and the rest of the tournament will be played in Athens, Ga.
The USC’s men’s tennis team is hoping to capture its 18th national title in program history.
Following a lengthy season, being physically fit is often the element that separates the winners and the losers.
“It’s easy to get motivated for such a big tournament,” said junior Jaak Poldma. “The physical part is most important. The key to winning is being healthy and being ready to play. Last year we did so great, we didn’t have injuries, and we were ready for each match.”
In an effort to better understand the environment surrounding the championships, the Trojans scheduled a trip to Georgia during spring break, which is even more crucial as USC could potentially face Georgia in the round of 16.
“That’s why we went there, to gain familiarity,” said USC coach Peter Smith of the 4-2 victory over the Bulldogs which broke Georgia’s 71-home match win streak. “To know how the courts play and have that recall during the NCAAs.”
With all of the time off between the Pac-10 championships and the start of the NCAA tournament, the team has to focus on honing the necessary skills for success.
“It’s training camp,” Smith said. “[The players] are preparing for finals in the classroom, and they have to prepare for finals on the court.  It’s time to sharpen the tools, coach them well and improve on the things we need to improve on: conditioning, fitness and doubles.”
The players understand that proper preparation depends on using all of the time that they have wisely.
“A lot is up to us in how we use our time,” Poldma said. “With the mental part, we have a little break, and we can come back more motivated and use the time off to get healthy.”
With the experience from last season, Smith felt that the three keys to capturing the title last season were “character, leadership and doubles.”
The doubles point has been a key factor throughout the season.
Whenever USC won the doubles point, they went on to win the match, but whenever they lost the initial point, the Trojans ended up falling short.
Last season proved to be a breakthrough as Smith won his first national championship as coach of the Trojans.
The experience of winning the title has the Trojans determined to defend their title.
“This year, we are a little more prepared,” said sophomore Steve Johnson. “We now know what it takes to win again. We’re going to do what we need to do as a team to prepare.”

Redshirt junior linebacker Jordan Campbell was nearly dismissed from the football team Tuesday by USC coach Lane Kiffin as a response to an undisclosed rules violation.
No one from the team would comment on the specifics of Campbell’s transgressions, but Kiffin did say that Campbell was not arrested.
“Something came up. It’s something we heard something about. We’re in the position we’re always in. Deciding if it’s accurate,” Kiffin said at practice.
A departure from the team would follow Campbell’s suspension from the team last winter for amassing too many negative points — penalties for missing class or tutoring sessions.
Campbell has seen little playing time during his football career at USC. During the 2009 campaign, he appeared in only two contests, collecting nine tackles overall as a fill-in from the bench.
Nevertheless, his absence from the team would further dilute a thin corps of linebackers. Frankie Telfort is dealing with a heart condition that will prohibit him from playing, sophomore Jarvis Jones suffered a potentially career-ending neck injury and Uona Kaveinga transferred to BYU.
That said, Campbell’s particular linebacker position received a boost when Kiffin announced this week that Chris Galippo will move to the strongside position.
Kiffin will announce a complete depth chart Friday.

A quick glance at the track list for B.o.B’s debut album, B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray, might seem as if the Decatur, Ga., rapper was simply using his widespread connections in an attempt to increase sales.
The record features prominent mainstream artists — T.I., Lupe Fiasco, Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo, Hayley Williams of Paramore and Eminem — with B.o.B, born Bobby Ray Simmons, performing only four solo songs.
After listening to all the tracks, however, it becomes apparent that B.o.B has more than enough talent to succeed on his own and could even reach the same level of status as some of the featured artists. The guest spots almost seem like afterthoughts compared to B.o.B’s impressive rhyming, singing and lyrical abilities.
B.o.B has often been compared to fellow Georgian rapper Andre 3000 of Outkast because of his similar voice and flow delivery. But from the album’s opener, “Don’t Let Me Fall,” B.o.B proves that he’s a unique artist. He seamlessly switches between melodic singing and quick-fire rapping, a trend that stays consistent throughout much of the album. The 21-year-old artist also plays guitar and keyboards on many of the songs, further demonstrating his versatility and boldness as a performer.
While The Adventures of Bobby Ray pushes the boundaries of hip-hop by creating a unique blend of genres, some of his songs lean toward the cheesy side of the popular music spectrum.
For instance, the chorus of “Airplanes,” sung by Williams, sounds as if it could easily fit on the soundtrack of a lower-rate Disney television musical. Despite the corny nature of the song, B.o.B still manages to provide thought-provoking lyricism about what his life would be like without the rap genre.
Further demonstrating B.o.B’s incredible versatility is the more boastful “Bet I,” featuring fellow Atlanta rappers T.I. and Playboy Tre.
This song — in addition to the uncontrollably catchy “Nothin’ On You” and the aforementioned “Airplanes” — is one of B.o.B’s songs that has been receiving heavy radio play lately.
The fact that these three singles are almost equally as popular but vary so greatly in style is yet another testament to B.o.B’s musical abilities.
“Nothin’ On You” is a love song with a smooth, soaring R&B hook; “Airplanes” is a mid-tempo, emotional song; and “Bet I” is a Southern rap anthem. Despite their differences, the songs are all highlighted by B.o.B’s recognizable rhymes and ability to craft catchy, enjoyable songs.
B.o.B’s ability is also apparent on many of the album’s less familiar songs. On “The Kids,” a song that features a Vampire Weekend sample, he shows his serious side with lyrics such as We’re trapped inside a matrix / Forced to play our hands / We’re filled with so much hatred / The kids don’t stand a chance.
In addition to “The Kids,” songs such as “Magic” featuring Rivers Cuomo, “Past My Shades” featuring Lupe Fiasco and “Fame” are all nearly as catchy as the album’s first three singles and could easily be future hits.
On songs like “Ghost In the Machine” and “Lovelier Than You,” however, B.o.B drops his rapping almost completely in an attempt to demonstrate his guitar and vocal abilities. There’s no question that B.o.B is a talented singer, but his primarily vocal songs are not nearly as impressive as the songs in which he shows off his natural rhyming abilities. “Ghost In The Machine,” a nearly five-minute-long ballad, gets a bit repetitive and boring about halfway through. Similarly, the lyrics on “Lovelier Than You” sound far too similar to “Nothin’ On You” and B.o.B’s acoustic strumming is not that impressive. 
Overall, B.o.B establishes himself as an incredibly talented artist on The Adventures of Bobby Ray. The songs greatly vary in style and content, and though his debut album may be filled with popular artists and unavoidably catchy singles, B.o.B has proven that he’ll be able to succeed on his own in the future.

Sampling each delectable 21 Choices flavor. Stargazing from the rooftop of Bovard. These are just a few of the adventures USC students can take
But what if a student were to organize these goals and fashion a schedule to achieve them? Undergrads at USC would do well to create a bucket list for their college years to ensure that they maximize their university experience.
Deb Berman | Daily Trojan
“I believe in goal setting because it creates a positive frame of mind,” said David McAlpine, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism and neuroscience. “A lot of people leave college life with regret. I don’t want to graduate and wish I would’ve made time to visit the Hollywood sign or take pictures on the walk of fame.”
Up next on David’s list: To visit Downtown’s 24-hour IHOP, where USC students can procrastinate their studies with the best kind of indulgence ­— pancakes.
Some argue that being enslaved to a bucket list prevents individuals from taking real pleasure in their experiences or living spontaneously. But harboring a checklist mentality can actually amp up a person’s carpe diem attitude.
Seeing your goals committed to paper — or computer screen — can have a sobering effect. It seems that when one recognizes his ambitions to get an internship or earn an A on that next midterm, the prospect of spending another 30 minutes perusing — rather, stalking — your acquaintance’s Facebook photos becomes considerably less appealing.
And not all intentions on a bucket list should be so solemn. It can be valuable to spice up your academic and career goals by challenging yourself to buy a lottery ticket on a whim or watch a Dodgers baseball game with friends from nosebleed seats. You could even up the ante by doing these things on a school night — an act of rebellion against nagging parents and 8 a.m. lectures.
Even by pursuing frivolous goals such as these, USC students have the opportunity to experience enjoyment from accomplishing their ambitions. Weighed down by the trappings of homework, extracurricular activities and internships, it can be a challenge for students to pause during the semester and reflect upon the quality of each day.
It is difficult enough to find time to breathe, sleep or eat a meal not prepared at Everybody’s Kitchen, which makes it nearly impossible to assess whether undergrads are making good use of these four years to live abundantly. By managing goals in a quantitative way with a bucket list, students can ensure that they will relish the experiences that are of highest priority.
Achieving small goals not only adds to the enjoyment of each day, it also provides students with long-term health benefits.
In a study performed by the Society for Public Health Education, doctors found that individuals who maintain a list of specific, achievable feats as well as pipeline dreams are more likely to perform higher than those who do not set goals at all or consume themselves with vague intentions, such as “to succeed.”
Furthermore, the process of executing these goals releases endorphins, “the happy hormone,” in the brain and can also improve cardiovascular health.
Graduating seniors and freshmen alike can experience the benefits of a bucket list, as it encourages students to cherish moments with friends and keep a balanced perspective about what is truly important ­— just a hint, it’s not our grade point averages.
“Obviously there’s stuff that I wish I did,” said Lindsey Farmer, a senior studying cinema-television production. “But in just living and enjoying my time at USC, I’ve had experiences that I would’ve never imagined and achieved goals I never would’ve thought to put on a list.
Even if you haven’t kept a bucket list for your undergrad years, there are other ways to ensure that your life as a college student is enriched with diverse experience.
Take time each day to do something that scares you, and be brave enough to laugh it off when the day approaches you with unexpected challenges.
Kelsey Clark is a sophomore majoring in print journalism.

Illegal means illegal
I’m writing in response to the article written by Angad Singh on April 26, titled “Immigration Debate Needs Humanization.” Singh wrote: “No one is illegal. A human cannot be illegal.” He went on to write, “We have to understand the plight of illegal immigrants entering our state,” and that “amnesty should be granted to the present illegal immigrants.” To say I found his article offensive would be an understatement.
My great grandfather came to this country legally. He came through Ellis Island, submitted his paperwork, and the only English he knew was “Hey mister, ya gotta job?” Like most Americans, he struggled during the Great Depression to provide for his family, but he managed to do so ethically — without cutting other people in line. He never took a dime of welfare and still sent all three of his children to college. He was grateful to America, the land of opportunity. He was a man of integrity and had a work ethic.
Similarly, my neighbor back in San Diego is sponsoring his brother, his wife and three children from Vietnam. They waited seven years to come here, making a lot of personal sacrifices to do so. And while there are thousands, if not millions, around the world who are still waiting in line to come here, Singh thinks rewarding current illegal immigrants with amnesty is an acceptable solution. This idea is anything but fair.
Singh wrote, “Are [illegal immigrants] really doing the wrong thing in trying to provide basic necessities for their families and provide better lives for their children?” My answer to this is, “Yes, if they are cutting other people in line to come here.”
Since when did one human being’s right to provide for his family take precedence over another human being’s right to provide for his family?
Is stealing an apple from one person’s hungry child to feed another person’s hungry child wrong?
Of course.
To disagree with the law recently passed in Arizona is one thing, but to defend the criminals — yes, criminals — who cut other hard-working human beings in line for entrance to this country is ridiculous. And while I also disagree with several phrasings in the recently passed Arizona immigration bill SB 1070, to make the jump from disagreeing with this bill to supporting illegal immigration is absurd.
I support legal immigration — if you take the time to come to America legally. But if you sneak across the border, you are trespassing. You are a criminal. And you deserve to be punished.
Yes, illegal immigrants are not commodities — they are human beings. But so are those who they cut in line.
Blake Spencer
Sophomore, business administration
The government made a huge mistake allowing this problem to continue to fester for years.. Arizona had to do something to protect it’s LEGAL citizens/Americans..One only has to spend some time there to see what they are up against, the crime, the kidnappings, the murders, the drugs that are all out of control. About 70% of Arizonans ( dems and repubs!) are for it. About 65% of all Americans in this country (legally), are also for it. It is time for us to stop bending over backwards, protecting the ILLEGAL (illegal means you have broken the law, OUR laws..),  immigrants and start protecting us, the citizens of this country, especially in crime ridden places like L.A. that have illegal immigrant gangland murders every day , of innocent children,  hit and run murders, rapes, kidnappings, you name it..we are going through similar problems that Arizona is having..so when is enough, enough!? I am asked to show my Driver’s License many times through the week when doing transactions, at stores, banks, if a tail light is out, etc. I do it gladly. Why is it too much to ask of EVERYONE, no matter what race, color or creed, to also have to display some sort of I.D.?   This is racial profiling? If I have to show my I. D.,  shouldn’t it be the same for ALL? For there to be ‘justice for all”? Why me, and not everyone else too? Heck, if I have to show my I.D. and I AM an American, what do we call it if illegals DON’T  have to show anything because that is not politically correct…But I do?? Let’s come up with some politically correct name for that kind of ‘profiling”…Americans have to show I.D. but illegals don’t and shouldn’t have to because we are worried it might be perceived as racial profiling..give me a break!

Ras, one of the main reasons Mexico is “pathetic” is because of NAFTA and our continued ratification of it. This act has crippled the agricultural business in Mexico and made life there terrible. It makes me livid when I hear people complain about how Mexicans are crossing the border to simply escape their own, self-made third world country. The US does need significant immigration reform for fisical reasons, but until quit adhering to NAFTA, we have absolutely no right to condemn people who flee to the US to seek a better life.
The main issue is Mexico is so pathetic even Mexicans do not want to live in it. Mexico is allowing it’s 3rd world problems to spill over the border. I thought Latino Pride actually meant something but it seems to mean “run away to another country”
It’s not just about -waiting- either, it’s about following the law and meeting up to the standards America sets. We expect immigrants to share our basic values — hard work and personal responsibility, tolerance for other races and religions, respect for women, and respect for the rule of law — and the screening process is a way of making sure that we only allow immigration from people willing to adopt the American way of life. (This doesn’t exclude anyone, because of course, anyone can adopt these values if they want to.)
Illegal aliens, by definition, do not share all of our values… at least not “respect for the rule of law”. They are all criminals and it is no surprise that so many of them turn to violence, theft, drug dealing, and other crimes after arriving. To give them the gift of citizenship that so many others are waiting and WORKING to earn is a great injustice and sends a terrible signal. It says to the world, if you break our laws and manage to stay hidden long enough, we’ll give you the greatest gift in the world for free. If you follow the rules and adhere to our values, though… good luck!
Rob, you’re missing the point of Blake’s article. It’s not a matter of cutting down time for those trying to enter the country legally. It’s a matter of fairness. By granting amnesty to current illegals, you are rewarding them for sneaking across the border and breaking the law. Maybe cutting in line isn’t the right phrase. Rewarding illegal behavior is more along the right lines.
My intent was indeed to critique that bit of terminology (used 4 times in the article) rather than disagree with the entire article.
Will giving illegal immigrants amnesty affect the length of time it takes other people to legally immigrate? Probably not, so only in a very abstract sense is anyone “cutting in line.”

The current economic climate has affected many students financially and emotionally. Because numerous students focus exclusively on financial security, they pursue careers they think will provide financial cushion, rather than careers they are passionate about.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
At the Marshall School of Business, many students think the most successful people at their school are those who get offers from investment banks, not those who have an excellent overall college experience.
I’m very happy for those who pursue investment banking if they are passionate about their chosen career. Unfortunately, many of them simply go into that career path because of the perception of “big bucks,” and plan to get out of their career as soon as they make enough money.
As a whole, many in our generation seem to be more focused on monetary compensation and not what they truly want for their lives.
As a teenager, I thought I was on the road to success; I was awarded a franchise from a major restaurant chain and found great success at a young age. I was very happy at the beginning because I was making six figures, driving a posh car and buying designer clothes without asking my parents for any money.
Soon, my addiction to money began to take a toll on my life. I came to think that life was all about becoming a millionaire, and would judge people based on their net worth rather than their character.
I began to work longer hours to make more money — I even ended up skipping my brother’s graduation. As a result, my personal relationships were almost destroyed.
Money took over my life, while my feelings and passions were no longer part of me. The situation was intensified in the microscope of Los Angeles where I was surrounded by people who believed that superficial pursuits are the only important ones.
My life changed when I went to a restaurant and saw one of my classmates who struggled financially but looked so much happier than I felt; I was just a money-making robot with no feelings.
I recently asked Emilio Diez-Barroso, a member of the board of directors at Summit Entertainment about his definition of success. He didn’t say that it could be defined as making more money. Instead, he said that for him success means having “the moment of miracle” or self-discovery. I couldn’t believe that one of the world’s most influential and successful business leaders defines success as having time for self-discovery.
After graduating from college, he joined his family’s Televisa and Univision empire, but he left the empire to follow his passion. The result: Not only is he successful in the business world but also has fulfilling personal relationships. 
The biggest mistake we make is letting money become who we are. Unconsciously, we make many decisions based on how much we have, not who we have become. Making less money doesn’t mean one should feel powerless and unhappy. If we let money define every aspect of ourselves, we will never have true happiness.
In less than a month, the graduating class of 2010 will go into the real world, but many are uneasy about their future.
We should look back and remember the day we got the acceptance letter to ’SC? We felt we owned the whole world and knew what our dreams and passions were. Where are your dreams and passions now?
They’re trying to survive somewhere in ourselves, but we could be neglecting them while stressing ourselves over future financial prosperity. Instead, we should take a step back to reacquaint ourselves with the importance of our ambitions.
Our passions might not give us financial security, but our names are not money; we are human beings whose passions and dreams define who we are.

Perry,  From the leadership you provided in class, I am not surprised at the philosophy you present in this article.  I have always said the happiest, and most successful people I know are those who have a passion for their work.  For those who don’t understand that (some of the other comments above) they will as they grow older and gain more experience.
you made six figures as a teenager?! WTF? So were u selling coke and illegal firearms from the back of that restaurant franchise? Good article, but I find it hard to swallow a teenager running a business could be making 6 figures. And im surprised that the author hasnt made the most obvious argument: Only if you do what you love and are passionate about it can you become really good at it, and that way you are likely to make a lot of moeny. As for all the marshall kids who want to go into investment banking….jeez are some of them stupid.
I bet if the economy were good and those Wall St. fat-cats didn’t get caught with their hands on the cookie jar you wouldn’t have written this article.
Perry, wonderful article and I wholeheartedly agree.
This is a really powerful article Perry.
You should feel proud that this was published on the Daily Trojan.
A nice one.
Wonderful article!
Perry, this is such a good article. Major props to you for getting this published.

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that consumers are finally spending money on more than just basic material goods again. It’s been two years since retailers, restaurants and other merchants made significant profits. Women are starting to splurge on cute shoes, families are celebrating birthdays at their favorites restaurants and couples are opting to improve their homes.
As a direct result of increased spending, employers are beginning to recall laid-off workers or hire new people. While it’s often hard to make heads or tails of the convoluted business jargon regarding sales, profits and markets, recent news seems to indicate there will be more happy people.
It’s important to keep in mind that the recent upturn is only in its early stages and much improvement is needed in the economy. California, one of the states most affected by the economic downturn, is not showing signs of improvement just yet.
Even so, the pattern is encouraging news for current laid-off workers and those entering the job market.
Upon reading this Wall Street Journal article, I began to wonder how the economic downturn has affected the decisions seniors are making regarding their future.
According to Andrew Starsiak, a senior majoring in biological sciences, the recession has not affected his immediate career path decisions. After graduation, Starsiak plans to work at a biological research firm in order to gain experience in that field. Though he hopes to continue his education within a few years, Starsiak is focusing on finding a job. He said the poor economic situation has not turned him away from that objective.
“The job market is like the tide. It will go in and out all through life. If you start using it as an excuse, you are already giving up on your goal,” he said.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
Similarly, Avi Kushlan, a senior majoring in communication who hopes to work as a director of video operations for an NFL team or a major college program, said he intends to enter the workforce following graduation, no matter what the economic situation.
“[I want to work in] anything with the word ‘grunt work’ in the description,” he said. “Internships, low-level assistants or anything similar that matches the skills I already have and provides me with the opportunity to take it to the next level.”
And if all else fails, we’ve got a great alumni base and Trojan Family on which to fall back.
“I got my job through USC’s career posting from the USC’s career website,” said Jason Finkelstein, a senior majoring in public relations. “They wanted to hire someone right out of USC because of their familiarity and satisfaction with USC students in the past.”
The news of the economic downturn has made it increasingly obvious that it’s difficult to predict the ebb and flow of the market; forecasts of the job market had predicted a much bleaker outlook than the current trend suggests.  Surely, seniors will benefit greatly by graduating during the beginning of the upward trend.
But if anything, this serves as a reminder that the job market is all about timing.  Rather than deciding to switch majors or add on additional academic pursuits for the sole purpose of increasing one’s job prospects, we should seek to pursue subjects that we are passionate about.
We can’t control the timing of the economy, but we can control what we choose to explore in our time here at USC.
Here’s to congratulating the class of 2010 and hoping that the future graduating classes will be able to catch a ride on the economic upswing.

This article is part of the Daily Trojan‘s supplement issue, “If you build it, will they come?” This semester’s supplement focused on the impact of the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center and University Gateway apartment complex, both of which will open this fall.
From the editors:
With the opening of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on the horizon, USC officials should be commended for taking a major step toward creating a residential culture on campus.
John Park | Daily Trojan
But this is only the first step, and we hope administrators don’t consider the job finished — or even halfway complete.
Administrators say the new building will make the University Park Campus a destination for students at night and on weekends — something it has never been before. But many of the restaurants will not be open on the weekend, and much of the building itself seems designed to impress visitors and potential applicants rather than provide functional space for current students.
We recognize that alumni, prospective students, administrators and faculty all needed upgraded facilities and a place to congregate, but we worry that without a true student union, comparisons of USC to schools like UCLA and Stanford will ring hollow to students.
To create a true and permanent residential atmosphere on campus, the campus center must be just one part of a broader plan to improve all aspects of student life.
To really pull students to campus would require large and dedicated student lounges, game rooms and an array of food options that are diverse and open late.
In addition, the overused Lyon Center is constantly packed, and students deserve the same state-of-the-art recreational facility that so many other top universities boast.
The field space and basketball/tennis court areas badly need upgrading too because intramural sports deserve the same quality of fields and facilities that the varsity program enjoys.
USC must work to guarantee housing to more of its undergraduate population, preferably on or next to campus. The university has already outlined a housing proposal as part of its Master Plan, and we hope the school moves quickly to implement this important vision. It’s not enough to let private developers seize the market for student housing — and charge premium prices.
We hope administrators recognize that this is a Herculean task requiring coordination and input from the entire Trojan community, especially current students.
USC should create a plan for reaching its goal of creating a residential university, so that all the different elements of the university can be working toward this end together. Perhaps a committee of students, faculty and top administrators — including our new president, C. L. Max Nikias — could create this plan.
Nikias’ leadership in particular will be crucial. He will become president at a crucial time in USC’s history, when its student life experience is badly trying to catch up to the school’s elite national reputation. We hope Nikias recognizes the challenge that’s ahead and acts swiftly to set USC on a path toward becoming a true residential university.

This article is part of the Daily Trojan‘s supplement issue, “If you build it, will they come?” This semester’s supplement focused on the impact of the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center and University Gateway apartment complex, both of which will open this fall.
Katherine Lewin thought she had found the perfect housing solution.
Leon Russo | Daily Trojan
Lewin, a freshman majoring in communication, wanted to live somewhere that was safe and convenient, and the new University Gateway apartments seemed like the perfect solution.
But her decision came at a high price.
“It’s way too expensive,” Lewin said. “I never would have gotten away with it if it wasn’t so close to campus.”
Lewin had to lobby her parents to convince them that the $1,170 a month they would pay for her spot in a two-bedroom apartment was worth it. They agreed to let her live in Gateway only because of its security and close proximity to campus, she said.
Gateway, the new housing complex on the corner of Figueroa Street and Jefferson Boulevard, is the latest high-end housing project to spring up near USC’s campus. As the number of students coming from far away has grown, the demand for convenient housing has increased, and housing developers have been working to give students options that will serve their needs.
Gateway certainly does succeed in increasing the number of housing options near campus. But with its going monthly rate of $1,064 per bed, Gateway also succeeds in perpetuating the trend that has been painfully visible in the campus area for years — safe, convenient and well-kept housing is available, but only to those willing to pay.
Six years ago, CDI Management bought several properties on 30th and 29th streets and turned those buildings into The Mirage, The Spot, The Pointe and The Place, all well-equipped, high-priced housing options. Westar Housing also owns a number of high-priced, luxury complexes around campus, including Chez Ronnee, Habitat Soozee and Tuscany, which opened four years ago near the intersection of Exposition Boulevard and Figueroa Street.
“We’ll rent to any student who wants to rent,” said Charlie Haggard, Westar’s chief operating officer. “But our target market is people who are looking for higher end.”
These luxury housing complexes offer students many benefits — from fitness centers and study rooms to enhanced security and easy access to campus. But many students find themselves forced to choose between affordable housing and the amenities offered by Gateway and its high-class counterparts, often sacrificing comfort and safety to save money or, conversely, sacrificing their paychecks for the sake of an enviable living situation.
Jarod Wunneburger, a senior majoring in sociology, has lived in USC Housing for three years. For his senior year, he was hoping to find his own room close to campus, but those requirements left him with few options.
“It was eye-opening to realize that if you want to be in one of the nicer apartments, it’s easily going to be two grand,” he said.
This luxury housing trend has developed largely because the number of students living near USC has grown faster than the number of beds available through USC Housing. Though the university recently expanded its offerings enough to guarantee two years in USC Housing to freshmen, its 6,800 beds sell out every year, and there is a long way to go before USC can guarantee housing for everyone.
Because demand for safe, comfortable housing exceeds what USC can provide, students must look elsewhere. And often, the options that offer safety and comfort are not cheap.
Keenan Cheung, director of USC Housing, said the university is working to eventually be able to guarantee housing for four years, but until then, USC has little say in trying to reverse the high-class housing trend.
“You have to realize that these places are for profit,” Cheung said. “They’re a little different model than we are … Our job is to supply what is needed for the student.”
Though some students have suggested that USC should step in to control the rising prices of off-campus housing, Cheung said there is little the school can do.
But the university hopes the Master Plan, once it gets underway, will help solve the housing problem.
The first phase of the Master Plan, which is currently awaiting city approval, involves razing and reconstructing the University Village, Cardinal Gardens and Century apartments. Ultimately, the Master Plan would add 5,200 beds to the USC area.
And even if those added housing options end up being more upscale than other area options, USC’s Associate Senior Vice President for Real Estate and Asset Management, Kristina Raspe, said the new units will be priced according to USC’s existing model.
Still, not all of those 5,200 new beds will be owned by USC. In determining the number of beds to add, the Master Plan includes non-USC owned housing complexes that meet certain standards — places like Gateway.
“The Master Plan definitely takes into consideration the building of Gateway,” Raspe said. “It was part of the planning process and is in line with the university’s plan for growth.”
Even if the Master Plan does help alleviate the pressure on the USC-area housing market, the project will not break ground until at least May 2012.
In the meantime, many students are left to choose between quality and affordability, and some say this has affected their time at USC.
“If you can’t afford the housing around USC, it definitely hurts your college experience,” Wunneburger said. “You definitely lose out on being part of the Trojan Family.”
Laura Cueva contributed to this report.
Moving a few miles away from campus for my senior year was the best financial decision I ever made–I went from paying $1,200 a month for a tiny, freezing cold studio apt on 30th st to paying $750 a month to share a 2 bedroom apt in Echo Park with gorgeous hardwood floors, high ceilings and an awesome location in an eclectic neighborhood…also, the 200 bus runs from my corner all the way to USC (it only takes 20 minutes or so, well worth the $1.50 bus fare)

This article is part of the Daily Trojan‘s supplement issue, “If you build it, will they come?” This semester’s supplement focused on the impact of the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center and University Gateway apartment complex, both of which will open this fall.
On a Friday in April, four Daily Trojan staffers took a tour of the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center, which is scheduled to open in August. The building offers an array of venues new to USC’s campus, and administrators hope it becomes a destination for students during the week, at night and on weekends. Here’s one student’s take on the places in the campus center most likely to help reach that goal.
The Ballroom
The Ballroom is enormous. Our tour guide boasted that it can seat 1,200 students, and administrators have touted its flexibility. It can be used for concerts, plays, lectures, parties and formal dinners. It can also be divided into smaller sections for conferences and meetings. Student groups will be able to reserve this room. I imagine it will end up being a cross between Town and Gown and Bovard Auditorium.
Traditions
For students, Traditions is clearly the premiere attraction in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. It’s built like a sports bar, with booths facing a long bar and flat screen televisions lining the walls. The bar will also serve food and unlike in the past, the new Traditions will be open to anyone, even those under 21. Like at The Lab, students who are drinking will be required to show I.D. Given Traddies’ new hours — open until at least 2 a.m. on weekends — I could easily see it becoming a go-to hangout for students wanting to grab a bite or a drink, watch the game or just relax.
Tommy’s Place
Tommy’s Place is connected to Traditions. It’s is a performance/hangout venue about twice the size of Ground Zero Café, and will be a great place for concerts, comedy sketches, readings, etc. It also has a huge screen that can broadcast live television, and we’re told Tommy’s will transform into a theater to watch away football games. There will also be pool tables. Combined with Traditions, Tommy’s seems like a great place for students to gather, but like everything else in the campus center I would have thought it’d be bigger, considering how many students will likely be using it.
The Trojan Family Room is the cornerstone of the campus center, the first thing you see when you enter the main doors. It seems, however, to be targeted least toward current students. It’s a large, circular room with fancy furniture and flashy memorabilia, but few televisions. The nearby concierge booth also struck me as strange. The Trojan Family Room seems like a way to sell USC to alumni and prospective students, who must walk by this room to reach the admissions center on the second floor. But I doubt many current students will hang out here.
Moreton Fig Restaurant
Moreton Fig Restaurant is the new Upstairs Commons. If you weren’t around for Upstairs Commons, you missed out: It was a sprawling upscale restaurant where students could use dining dollars. Moreton Fig is in the same mold, but in a more intimate setting. Tight booths and wide windows dot the room; it has access to a patio seating area and it has a bar. But, like the food court, it seems much too small for USC’s huge student body and Trojan Family. We didn’t get a peek at the menu, but it likely won’t be cheap.
The Food Court
The food court is a wide open space next to a large outdoor courtyard. It will house Wahoo’s Fish Taco, Carl’s Jr., a small version of California Pizza Kitchen, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and one other restaurant to be announced soon. There’s also a marketplace similar to the one in The Lot. The food court is surprisingly small and I found myself wondering if it could accommodate the lunch rush. But an array of flat screen televisions means it could be a great place to grab a bite and watch the game. Take-out windows that are accessible from the courtyard also mean students will be able to order food after the food court is closed.

This article is part of the Daily Trojan‘s supplement issue, “If you build it, will they come?” This semester’s supplement focused on the impact of the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center and University Gateway apartment complex, both of which will open this fall.
In his eight semesters at USC, Fabian Salas, a senior majoring in accounting, spent a lot of time exploring Los Angeles. He spent little time, however, exploring his own campus.
“There have been semesters where I was working weekends at Leavey [Library], but most of the time I would just not be around campus if I didn’t have to be because the campus is always pretty dead,” Salas said. “When I didn’t have to work, I knew I would have a better time going out to other places in L.A.”

Salas is not the only one who feels this way. For years, students looking for weekend entertainment have had to look elsewhere — campus has been a virtual ghost town on weekends. But with the opening of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, that could be about to change.
Administrators hope the addition of the campus center this fall will finally create a central, on-campus destination that students have been missing since the closing of the Norman Topping Student Center and Commons in 2008. When it opens, the campus center will include meeting rooms, performance venues and food options, and will hopefully host a number of student organizations’ events.
“I really believe this building will transform the word ‘community’ at USC,” said Jason Cruz, project coordinator for the campus center. “[It] will become the hub of activity, and I think people will start saying, ‘Meet me at the campus center.’”
For the past two years, student organizations have relied solely on Bovard Auditorium, Ground Zero Café and classroom lecture halls to host events and performances, and some have found it difficult to find an appropriate venue.
Alexa Ekman, president of the USC College Republicans, said finding a venue for events has been very challenging. Ekman tried to book a room three months in advance for the group’s biggest event of the year, Teach-in to Oppose Obama’s Radical Transformation of America, but had to settle for a room in Taper Hall instead.
Ekman said it is disappointing to bring important guest speakers to campus only to have them greeted with a classroom lecture hall, rather than a more welcoming venue.
“It’s fine to have regular meetings in classrooms or smaller settings, but when you have a nice speaker, guests who donate to your club and people who travel to see your event, you want to host it in a really nice environment,” she said.
According to Heather Larabee, assistant dean of students and director of Campus Activities, the campus center will make it much easier for organizations that have had trouble finding venues to host events on campus.
Aja Heisler, director of external communications for the USC College Democrats, said the group is excited because the campus center will offer neutral venues.
“Usually we can find a venue, but last weekend we held something at the USC Hillel Center. That could have possibly been misleading to people because our events are in no way associated with religion, they were just nice enough to let us borrow the area,” Heisler said.
Cristina Pandol, executive director of Women and Youth Supporting Each Other, has also run into issues because of the lack of space on campus.
“We had to hold our self-defense event in Exposition Park, and, being outdoors, we were nervous it would rain,” Pandol said. “With about 150 people, it’s not like we could have just used a classroom.”
Students will be able to reserve meeting rooms, The Forum and Tommy’s Place for free, while the Ballroom will cost money, said Heidi Ippolito, scheduling production manager for the SCheduling Office. Student organizations will also be allowed to utilize the Ballroom for one event for free, except staffing charges.
The campus center will also offer more than 30 meeting rooms for students and will have lounges on every floor.
Visions and Voices currently holds a number of events in Bovard Auditorium, but the addition of the campus center will be beneficial since events can now be held in the Ballroom or The Forum, according to Mary Megowan, program assistant for Visions and Voices.
The Ballroom can accommodate nearly 1,200 people, and can be divided into four sections depending on the number of guests attending the event, according to Bailey.
For some organizations, like USC Spectrum, The Forum offers a much more intimate space.
“We like doing events in Doheny [Memorial Library] because you feel like you really get to be in the same space as the guest speaker, and The Forum will be very similar to that,” said Dane Martens, interim director of USC Spectrum.
Student organizations, such as Program Board, are excited to utilize Tommy’s Place because they believe the venue will help attract more students.
Tommy’s Place offers its own distinct feel with a stage for performances, two pool tables and televisions that can be used by students and faculty for away  games.
Adjacent to Tommy’s Place will be the new and improved Traditions, which will be available for all students to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. For those over 21, Traddies will still serve alcohol.
“Our goal is for this area to be one big space. You can watch a live performance at Tommy’s and grab a drink at the bar if you’re over 21,” Cruz said. “The Greek Row is a popular place and we want this to be another option.”
KSCR radio station will also broadcast from new facilities adjacent to Tommy’s Place.
According to Karl Nickenig, KSCR’s incoming general manager, the station hopes to host a live show every Friday from its new location in the campus center.
“I hope it brings more awareness of the local band scene to the overall student body,” Nickenig said.
In addition to live performances, the campus center will host a wide variety of food options, including California Pizza Kitchen, Carl’s Junior, Wahoo’s Fish Taco, a marketplace, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and Moreton Fig, according to Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality.
Klinger said dining options will be available on the weekends, but the hours of operation will depend on student usage.
Many at USC hope the campus center will provide a common gathering place for students.
“You should feel comfortable here, and that’s the goal of this place — to have all of the communities of the university come together in one location,” Bailey said. “Like a community center, the campus center will bring all the facets of USC together.”

This article is part of the Daily Trojan‘s supplement issue, “If you build it, will they come?” This semester’s supplement focused on the impact of the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center and University Gateway apartment complex, both of which will open this fall.
USC’s reputation and the quality of its student body have made unparalleled strides in the last 15 years — and the campus social scene could finally be ready to catch up.

When the Ronald Tutor Campus Center opens its doors in August, it will represent the first serious attempt to change a culture whose social heart is often on The Row or at the Coliseum, but rarely on campus. Administrators and students are hoping the building will have a major impact on USC’s social scene, creating a permanent residential atmosphere on campus for the first time.
But the building is not targeted exclusively at students, and the allocation of the campus center’s space, along with the hours its rooms and restaurants will be open, leave questions about whether it can meet administrator’s lofty goals.
“A residential community is not just beds and pillows,” said Patrick Bailey, the Student Affairs administrator charged with overseeing the new building. “The campus center is one of the biggest first steps the university is making in really welcoming students to stay on campus after hours [and] on the weekends.”
Bailey and others involved in the project hope the new building will draw students to campus even when they don’t have class. The building will be open from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m., seven days a week. A new Traditions bar with seating and televisions is tucked into the basement next to a large performance venue, Tommy’s Place, which also has pool tables.
“To change a culture, it takes four years,” Bailey said. “You have to go through each class.”
In a way, the campus center represents the midway point of USC’s long transition from a commuter school to a true residential university. If the last decade was marked by a dramatic change in the student population — SAT scores that rival Stanford’s, students who hail from across the country and world, an unprecedented ascension in the U.S. News & World Report rankings — the next decade will be shaped by physical changes.
The massive University Gateway apartments and campus center buildings will open in the fall. USC’s Master Plan, the school’s road map for expansion north of Jefferson Boulevard over the next 30 years, calls for razing the University Village, Cardinal Gardens and Century; building new housing and retail space; and turning Jefferson into a pedestrian walkway. And by next year, a new light rail along Exposition Boulevard should be operating.
Of all these physical changes, the campus center will have the quickest and most dramatic impact on student life. But unlike campus centers at other schools, the Ronald Tutor Campus Center was not designed solely for students.
The campus center’s anchor is not a student lounge but is instead the Trojan Family Room, a meeting area that also serves as a showcase of Trojan memorabilia. Upscale furniture and a concierge booth greet alumni, current Trojans and prospective students, who can walk upstairs to the admissions office on the second floor.
There is no movie theater — like in UC San Diego’s massive Price Center — and no bowling alley, like the one on the top of The George Washington University’s student center. There are several student lounges, but most are smaller rooms more conducive to studying than watching a football game.
This will make it harder for the campus center to impact student life as much as administrators hope. But students say that just having a central place to hang out, relax, meet friends or study will be a huge boost for the campus experience.
“[USC is] a college community, but it’s a college community with a lot of people living in apartments Downtown, living off campus and a lot of people who come to campus just for classes,” said John Legittino, who was an Undergraduate Student Government spokesperson in 2009 and graduated the same year.
And although Jenny Novak, the incoming president of the Graduate and Professional Student Senate, said the center likely would “not be enough to draw me in on weekends,” she said it will give graduate students an easy, central meeting place on campus.
The administrators in charge of the campus center acknowledge that it was never meant to be tailored entirely toward students. Faculty, incoming students, alumni and administrators all had little space to interact and mingle, and the campus center was designed to be an upgrade for all of these groups.
Denzil Suite, associate vice president for Student Affairs, said this won’t come at a cost to students. The building is meant to be flexible. Suite highlighted the building’s 30 meeting rooms — some of which can hold hundreds of people — that student groups can reserve without paying a deposit.
“If someone wants to have a small, intimate poetry reading, you can have that, and if you want to have a large fundraising dinner for your organization, you can do that, too,” he said.
Indeed, the campus center’s success might hinge on whether students are tempted onto campus by the venue’s programming. Student Affairs has planned a slate of activities and events to keep those rooms busy.
This fall, the Undergraduate Student Government, GPSS, Program Board and the University Residential Student Community will each host a Thursday evening event in Tommy’s Place once a month. “Friday Night Fix” will feature recurring performances by the Second City comedy group Upright Citizens Brigade. College band night and other concerts dot the venues’ calendars. And, during football games and other sporting events, the enormous projection screen in Tommy’s Place will extend for students to watch the action.
Still, many parts of the campus center will close on the weekends. Traditions will sell food and stay open until 2 a.m., and Lemonade, a restaurant new to USC that has several locations in Los Angeles, will also have extended weekend hours. But the five restaurants in the center’s main food court — including Carl’s Jr., California Pizza Kitchen and Wahoo’s Fish Taco — will have hours similar to The Lot, where venues close at 7 or 8 p.m. and are closed on weekends (with the exception of Baja Fresh).
Those hours could be extended depending on student demand, and some food court restaurants might eventually stay open on the weekend, said USC Hospitality Director Kris Klinger.
“As students speak with their feet and their money, we will determine what will be open and when,” he said.
Students aren’t the only ones excited about the campus center’s potential impact. President of the Faculty Alex Capron, a professor at the Gould School of Law and Keck School of Medicine, has made what he calls a “living university” road map his goal. The idea is to encourage interactions between faculty members and students outside the classroom, and Capron believes the campus center has the potential to be an intellectual hub.
If students and professors take advantage of the campus center by holding meetings and socializing, Capron said, the center could become a natural gathering place and an incentive for faculty to live closer to campus.
“[Those interactions] really ought to take place by people being together in an environment that fosters intellectual exchanges,” Capron said.
When the building opens it will mark the first part of a broader plan to improve student life on campus. The recreational facilities need upgrading, Bailey acknowledged; so does the student health center, Suite said.
But for now, Bailey thinks the new building’s impact could be immense.
“The building is a game changer,” he said.

International investigative journalist, Oprah Winfrey Show correspondent and USC graduate Lisa Ling will speak to students tonight, sharing stories from her career, which has sent her all over the world to reveal unknown and often controversial stories to the American public.
Around the world · Lisa Ling’s journalism career has taken her to a wide variety of locations including Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Colombia. - Photo courtesy of Berit Elam 
Ling’s appearance is sponsored by the Women’s Student Assembly and will be held at 7:30 p.m. in SGM 123.
Berit Elam, executive director of the WSA, said the group chose to bring Ling to campus because it feel that hearing about Ling’s experiences will influence students in a positive way.
“She is a really excellent example of a woman working in a challenging field,” Elam said. “She’s not afraid to be empowered with the way she approaches her job.”
Ling’s career took off at the age of 16, when she was selected to be one of four hosts on Scratch, a nationally syndicated teen magazine show based in Sacramento.
Only two years later, Ling became a reporter for Channel One News; the job gave her the opportunity to cover stories like the war in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan. While working for Channel One, she gave reports from more than 20 countries, but still found time to attend and graduate from USC.
In 1999, Ling became a host on The View, which has received multiple Emmy nominations for outstanding talk show.
She left the show in 2002, however, to resume her international reporting career.
In 2002, Ling became the first female host of National Geographic Explorer. With National Geographic, she has covered controversial stories such as the drug war in Colombia, notorious gangs and U.S. prison culture
But some of Ling’s most famous stories came after she took a job as a special correspondent for The Oprah Winfrey Show. As an investigative reporter for the show, Ling gave reports on issues such as gang rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and bride burning in India.
“Her whole career has been devoted to revealing cases of female disparity and other mistreatment of humans throughout the world,” Elam said. “She tries to highlight things that aren’t brought to America’s attention very often and that we may not even know about.”
Elam said she thinks Ling will appeal to students for several reasons.
“She is a very strong speaker; she really relates to the audience and she has such amazing stories to tell,” Elam said. “Her whole job is being able to share the powerful things she has learned, so I know it will definitely be a captivating event.”
Many students said they are excited that Ling is coming to campus and are planning to attend the event.
“I loved her work on The View,” said Tricia Dong, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business). “She always had a lot of good points that made me think. I would definitely go to this event because I think that she is an influential woman in the broadcasting industry.”
Nikki Nathan, a sophomore majoring in economics and math, echoed Dong’s enthusiasm.
“She’s really interesting. I see her on Oprah a lot and she has a bunch of cool projects. I think she would be a fascinating person to go watch,” Nathan said.
Some students said they are also interested in hearing Ling talk about her sister, Laura, who was detained in North Korea with fellow journalist Euna Lee. The two were working on a story about female trafficking there in March 2009 when they were arrested and convicted on charges of illegally entering North Korea.
After talks between former President Bill Clinton and Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the two journalists were released in August 2009. During and after this ordeal, Ling helped raise public awareness for Laura’s situation and also served as her sister’s moral support.
“I would be interested to see if she would talk about her sister’s situation after she was arrested in North Korea,” Nathan said.
Elam said that she expects the event, which the WSA has been planning since before winter break, to be filled to capacity.
Some students, however, said their workloads this week will make attending the event a challenge.
“I’ve heard of her, but to be honest, I probably wouldn’t go. This is a really busy week for me,” said Nick Palacio, a sophomore majoring in English.
That is the lamest last quote ever. Oh, Nick, or rather, oh Alyssa.

USC communication professor Gordon Stables is looking to revolutionize traditional debate.
Stables, who teaches a course called Advocacy in Public Diplomacy: Argumentation and Debate (PUBD 509) is the coach of the Trojan Debate Squad. He debated in high school and again in college, and after becoming a faculty member in 2002, began coaching the debate team at USC.

Since he began debating, Stables said he has noticed the world of debate shift.
“A lot of how we deliberate and engage today is through social media,” Stables said.
So, starting next year, Stables plans to host what he calls the first video debate tournament.
Debaters will record videos of their speeches and rebuttals and will post the videos on a website Stables calls “VBate.” USC is the first university in America to work with the VBate video platform.
Stables is also looking to integrate Twitter into debates, experimenting with having students make their point in three or four tweets.
The initiative is new and open to improvement, Stables said.
“The year one mission is experimentation. We are encouraging students to give feedback on the social media site so that we can improve,” Stables said.
The initiative has seen some resistance, Stables said, because of what he calls a fear of the “paperless debate.”
Stables said there are people who argue that something is lost in a digital, paperless debate or that debating within Twitter’s mandated 140-character frame might limit what would be said in a traditional debate.
He emphasized, however, that there is no desire to replace any form of traditional debate.
“We are not trying to replace the old debates with technological debates; we’re just trying to complement them,” Stables said.
The main goal of this initiative, though, is to make debate accessible to more people.
“What we’re realizing is that the traditional paradigm of competitive high level debate isn’t for everyone because it requires a lot of time and energy for people to do,” said Anna Li, a member of the Trojan Debate Squad and the program coordinator for the digital initiative.
Stephanie Scott, captain of the Trojan Debate Squad, emphasized the importance of appealing to the general public to get interested in debate and highlighted additional benefits of online debate.
“Debate can be very expensive as it requires traveling,” Scott said. “Online debate allows you to talk to people who you wouldn’t normally talk to. Any way that debate can become more useful to the public is good.”
The VBate website and other pieces of the digital initiative run simultaneously with other projects Stables and his team are working on.
One such project is the USC Neighborhood Debate League. Sponsored by University Neighborhood Outreach and the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, the program helps train high school debaters and holds debate tournaments at five local high schools.

One family is changing the study of neuroscience at USC.
Trustee David Dornsife and his wife Dana have donated a total of $21 million to neuroscience endeavors at USC. Most recently, they donated $6 million to the Brain and Creativity Institute, a research program within the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
The donation will be used to fund a new building for the institute. The building will be about 12,000 square feet and is being designed by Michael Maltzan, one of the architects who helped design the Walt Disney Concert Hall. It will let the institute house all the researchers’ resources in one location for the first time.
“Their latest gift will create a state-of-the-art facility for the Brain and Creativity Institute, including an auditorium that can be used for academic purposes and as a performance space,” said Howard Gillman, dean of the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences. “This is important, given the special nature of the scientific work being done at the institute.”
The new facility will be located next to the Dana and David Dornsife Cognitive Neuroscience Imaging Center and will become a place for research in early brain development, emotions, consciousness, aging, education and learning. The building will offer new laboratory space, a conference center and a state-of-the-art auditorium.
Researchers who work at the Brain and Creativity Institute said they hope the new building will facilitate collaboration and communication.
“I’m hoping the facility will have a new space or conference area for us to perform our psychophysiology tests,” said Savio Wong, a postdoctoral research associate. “It would be very convenient to have the new facility next to the imaging center so we don’t have to travel very far to communicate with other researchers.”
Mary Helen Immordino-Yang, assistant professor of psychology at the Brain and Creativity Institute, echoed this sentiment. “The fact that the facility will foster a group of scholars from biological, socio-cultural and psychological aspects is a unique endeavor that will bring new ideas to the institute in the future.”
This is not the first time the Dornsifes have donated to brain research at USC.
The Dornsifes have had a significant impact on the university, beginning with David’s parents, Harold and Ester Dornsife, who were generous USC alumni contributors.
“In the 1980s, USC wanted to ensure that we were on the cutting edge of research in the evolving field of neuroscience,” Gillman said. “We were successful in this regard because of the support of people such as Harold and Ester Dornsife, whose previous contributions to the Seeley G. Mudd Building helped create a facility that enhanced science education at USC, and whose commitment to neuroscience led to the construction of the Hedco Neuroscience Building.”
David and Dana Dornsife endowed two chairs in memory of Harold and Ester and donated a lead gift to establish the Dana and David Dornsife Cognitive Neuroscience Imaging Center in the USC College.
David Dornsife has served on the Board of Trustees since 2002. He is the chairman of the board of the Herrick Corporation and the GILLIG Corporation. He is chairman of the board of the USC Brain and Creativity Institute and a 1965 graduate of the Marshall School of Business at USC.
Dana Dornsife is the co-founder of Axiom Design, Inc., a lighting design and home automation consulting firm. She is on the Board of Directors of Global Healing, which provides modern health care in developing countries, and on the board of the USC-Huntington Institute for Advanced Studies.

It might seem unlikely, but for the past three years, the senior class valedictorian has come from the Viterbi School of Engineering.
First in line  · Liana Ching, a senior majoring in chemical engineering, is this year’s valedictorian. She will deliver a speech at commencement. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
The extensive math and science demanded by Viterbi’s curriculum is enough to scare many people away, but this year’s valedictorian, Liana Ching, embraced the challenge.
Ching, a senior majoring in chemical engineering, earned an overall 3.98 grade point average, which — combined with her extracurricular activities, post- graduation plans and an essay — won her the honor of 2010 valedictorian.
“In a way, I’m being asked to represent the achievements of the class of 2010,” Ching said. “It’s taking kind of a long time I would say for the gravity of that to sink in.”
Ching was among 18 seniors invited to submit an application for valedictorian in the beginning of March. Each candidate has a 3.98 grade point average or above and a transcript without any B’s, said Gene Bickers, vice provost for undergraduate programs.
“We try to make sure that we go over every student who’s eligible,” Bickers said. “I’m glad I don’t have to make the selection because they’re all amazing students.”
In addition to Ching’s chemical engineering major, she has an emphasis in environmental engineering and a minor in forensics and criminality. Ching will spend this summer in Oregon working on air pollution for Intel’s Logic Technology Developmental group and then will attend Stanford University in the fall to pursue a master’s degree in environmental engineering.
At USC, Ching has been project manager of Engineers Without Borders, an organization in which students travel to developing countries and facilitate the building of a necessity for the community, for the past few years. She has focused on constructing a water system in Honduras since her freshman year.
“The big challenge is just getting it all done, getting all the work done on time and still having time to get to do other things,” she said.
Ching also played on the women’s club soccer team and several intramural sports, represented Viterbi as a student ambassador and participated in the Society of Women Engineers, among other organizations.
“Liana is very special,” said Louise Yates, dean of Viterbi admissions and student affairs. “She’s also someone who’s been incredibly involved … She doesn’t sleep, I don’t think.”
Ching attended a small private high school in San Diego, which she said jumpstarted her education and placed her ahead in math before she was a freshman at USC. Looking for a bigger school, Ching chose USC for its vibrant community.
“When I came to college, I actually wanted to let myself not have the grade be the ultimate goal in my courses,” Ching said.
With the hefty requirement of 132 units for a chemical engineering major, Ching focused on learning the material and understanding the concepts, which consequently produced good grades, she said.
Viterbi gave her a sense of place, Ching said, and made her feel like the faculty and staff knew each student by name.
“It’s awesome because it’s almost like another small university within the university,” Ching said. “It’s like that small-school feel with all of the resources of a larger school.”
Ching, who studied in Rome during the summer 2008 as part of a study abroad program specifically designed for engineering students, said she is grateful for the opportunities USC afforded her.
“I’m going to miss being a student here and having ridiculous perks and having access to tons of activities without even trying,” Ching said. “I’ve really gotten to explore new things here.”
Ching said that, more than anything, she is grateful for the help she has received along the way. 
“I think that every stage of life kind of builds on the ones before it,” Ching said. “And I’ve definitely had all the support that I could have asked for.”
How inspiring!  I teach a prerequisite for a highly competitive program (3.8 GPA required).  I try to stress that students who ask questions on the material do better than students who ask questions about their grades (which is true) – if you actually learn the material, the A’s will come.   I will be mentioning your success this semester.
Awesome to see a Parker graduate earn this honor.  All of your friends in San Diego are proud of you.  Maybe your time in the Viterbi Science Center helped with this road…
CONGRATULATIONS!
What an inspiring story. Congratulations!
Congratualations Liana!!!

My hat goes off to you. You achieved a 3.98 in a difficult major; Viterbi is putative for having the lowest average GPA (its academics are that rigorous and competitive) among its students; and you’re going to perhaps the most competitive university, Stanford, for graduate studies. Please don’t turn into a Stanford-snob during football games.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate passed the new administration’s 2010-2011 budget Tuesday night with eight “aye”s and zero “nay”s.
The budget that passed was $25,000 less than the budget presented at last week’s USG meeting. USG officials discovered last week that they were receiving $25,000 less from the carry-over fund — money left over from the 2008-2009 administration — than they had anticipated.
Past USG administrations have received about $25,000 from the carry-over fund after passing their budgets and have had to amend their budgets accordingly. This year, the administration assumed they would also get about $25,000 and factored it into their budget, only to find out that the money was not there because of an accounting error made during the 2008-2009 administration.
On Tuesday, the proper amendments were made to the budget that had been presented last week to account for the $25,000 difference.
The budget could still change, however.
This summer, the university’s Board of Trustees will vote on USG’s proposed $1 increase to the student programming fee. If that increase comes through, USG will be able to use the budget it had proposed at last week’s meeting.
Although the current instability of the budget could cause difficulties for other committees and branches of USG, Treasurer Brian Anderson assures them that it will not be too big of a difference.
Anderson said he is advising committees to plan based on the budget passed Tuesday, but to be aware that their budget could change if the programming fee increase is approved.
“We communicated that there might be increases, but we tell them not to plan for it until it is approved,” Anderson said. “The extra $25,000 will be spread over the entire organization, so their budgets will only increase at most a couple percentage points.”
Members of USG said they are hoping the programming fee increase goes through.
“The [budget] increase would have been nice, but the financial committee will approve what they think is right,” said Genevieve Flores, director of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Assembly.
The Board of Trustees will reconvene for their summer quarter meeting, so USG will know if it has been approved before school starts. The dollar increase is already reflected on students’ Oasis accounts, however.
“We’re not sure if it’s a mistake,” Anderson said. “Student Affairs approved it, so it seems good. It just has to go to the Board of Trustees.”
