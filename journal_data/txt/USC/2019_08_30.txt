Practice is over at Howard Jones Field for the USC football team. One by one, Trojans are filing off the grass, each carrying their beat up pads and sweat-drenched jerseys in one hand. A glance at almost any player will quickly reveal the signs that practice ended 35 minutes late — faces covered in sweat, pads seeming to weigh more than they really do, slow trots toward the gate that deposits them onto McClintock Avenue, closing the book on the third-to-last practice before the season opener against Fresno State. 
Something doesn’t quite fit. It’s the gears of a machine firing; split seconds later, the sound of pigskin colliding and sticking like glue to bare hands. It doesn’t make sense, everyone has checked out. But way in the back, past the far sideline of the practice field, it’s there, and it’s constant, and that football isn’t getting grass stains any time soon. 
Did someone say practice is over? Don’t tell Amon-Ra St. Brown. He might hear you, but he sure won’t care. 
The 6-foot-1, 195-pound sophomore wide receiver is still at work, pumping his arms through the air to mimic a route, just yards away from the robot quarterback firing passes at what seems like dangerous speeds. Suddenly, he shoots his arms up to trap the football between his hands like a vacuum. Ten, 20, 30 reps, zero drops. He reels in the last one, and he’s finally done. Right?
Wrong. St. Brown seeks the assistance of a real quarterback, and, with his back turned to the passer, only catches sight of the football at the last second before two fully outstretched arms reel it in. Ten, 15 of those. Twenty minutes have passed since the second-to-last Trojan took part in any real drills, and St. Brown is on his back as if knocked to the ground by three cornerbacks, swallowing up any ball in his vicinity, whether or not multiple hands are required. 
When he’s done, St. Brown heads for the exit, his lack of sweat giving off the impression that he hasn’t worked out in three days. That couldn’t be further from the truth.
In reality, this shouldn’t surprise anyone. St. Brown’s been this way his whole life. The youngest of three children, he’s continuing a family tradition of wide receiving excellence.
“Being the youngest, I always had to push a little extra harder to beat them in whatever it was,” St. Brown said of his two older brothers. “Whether it was pickup basketball, playing football outside, catch around, they were always a step faster than me because they were older.”
The eldest of the three St. Brown children, Equanimeous, is a wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers. The middle child, Osiris, is a senior wideout at Stanford. 
Most children placed in Amon-Ra’s position would feel the weight of inevitably enormous expectations. Not this one, though — that sort of thing just doesn’t affect St. Brown. 
“I never feel pressure for anything,” he said. “The only pressure you have is the pressure you put on yourself.” 
It’s not pressure but competition that makes St. Brown go. Sophomore quarterback JT Daniels has known and played with St. Brown since they were both in seventh grade, and while Trojan fans are just getting familiar with the high achieving wideout, it’s nothing new for USC’s signal-caller. 
“He’s competitive in everything he does,” Daniels said, recalling a time when St. Brown nearly broke a controller after his long-time quarterback beat him in FIFA. “No matter if it’s fashion, Madden, [NBA] 2K — everything.”
Competition is inherent with St. Brown; he lives off it, feeds off it, moves because of it. Competing against his brothers played a big role in developing that mindset, but one doesn’t have to look outside his family to find another driving source of his competitive nature. 
Amon-Ra, Osiris and Equanimeous are the sons of one of the most successful bodybuilders of the 1980s: three-time Mr. World and two-time Mr. Universe John Brown. 
Naturally, Brown had each of his three sons hitting the gym around the time most kids were getting acclimated to second grade. 
“I think I was seven years old when I started lifting,” St. Brown said. “Lifting was innate in us because he pushed that in us really early on. So I think we really got the edge on other kids growing up, being stronger than them, because obviously our dad was a weightlifter. He pushed us in the weight room, so just being stronger than the kid in front of us really helped us growing up.” 
Is that around the time St. Brown began to dominate on the gridiron? After all, bench pressing 135 pounds at age 8 would figure to separate him from kids who likely first saw the inside of a gym around 12. 
His quarterback isn’t so sure. He thinks St. Brown’s been on a different level for quite a bit longer. 
“Probably since birth,” Daniels said. “He’s always been Amon.”
John Brown is a tough father who wants nothing but the best for his three similarly-aged kids who all play the same sport at a high level. There are comparisons to be drawn between the St. Browns and the infamous Ball family, but the youngest receiver doesn’t see it that way. 
“When we’re all on the football field or in the weight room, when he’s training us, he’s our coach, he’s really tough,” St. Brown said. “But then outside of that he’s a really loving father, and he’s going to be just a normal father, have fun with us, joke around … [people] kind of see us in that same way, but I think we’re two kind of different families.”
St. Brown’s father has been training his children in the weight room and guiding their diet for years, and Daniels has seen the effects of Brown’s influence first hand. 
“He wasn’t even tired after the first [fall] practice,” Daniels said. “He ran four and a half miles. That’s like, sprinting. Two and a half hours, he ran four and a half miles, and it was like nothing for him.”
St. Brown’s physical fitness has helped him become one of the Pac-12’s best receivers after just one year at the collegiate level. A five-star product out of Anaheim, St. Brown led the Trojans with 60 receptions in 2018, piling up 750 yards and three touchdowns on the season.
He’s doing everything he can to bring USC back to the top of the college football stratosphere. St. Brown came to USC with the intention of winning games and picking up a few Heismans along the way, so don’t expect him to take any prisoners this year. After all, this is Amon-Ra St. Brown — whose father added “St.” to his kids’ last names and named his youngest after one of the most important Egyptian gods. He is destined for greatness.
The trilingual sophomore, just as fluent in German and French as he is in dominating on Saturdays, is carving his own path and doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon. Equanimeous and Osiris motivate him to be better, but Amon-Ra’s plans are far greater than surpassing those two. 
If you ever run into St. Brown around campus, ask him who holds the throne between him and his brothers. He’ll give you the same answer that any youngest child would give but few would actually believe: 
“You’re looking at him right now.”
You might be skeptical at first, but the look in his eyes as he delivers those six words should tell you all you need to know.
St. Brown doesn’t just believe it. He knows it. And he’s ready to prove it.

Following a disappointing 5-7 season that left USC football with far more questions than answers, the Trojans are gearing up for one of the more pivotal seasons in recent program history. The following will determine the outcome of USC’s 2019 season — for better or worse.  
Team MVP: Sophomore quarterback JT Daniels
The No. 3 quarterback recruit in the class of 2018 had an inconsistent freshman season at USC. Despite an unimpressive 14-10 touchdown to interception ratio, Daniels posted a respectable 59.5% completion percentage and showed flashes of excellence by going 17-26 with 241 yards and three touchdowns against Washington State and 37-51 with 349 yards and no interceptions against Notre Dame. The talent is clearly there, but the questionable play-calling from former offensive coordinator Tee Martin seemed to prevent Daniels from getting into any sort of rhythm. Look for new offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s quarterback-friendly Air Raid offense to elevate Daniels’ game to new levels and carry the Trojan offense in 2019.
Best position group: Wide receivers
Incoming sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown (60 receptions), redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns (eight total touchdowns) and senior Michael Pittman Jr. (68.9 receiving yards per game) made for one of the best receiving corps in the Pac-12 last season. That unit should only get stronger this fall. After landing the No. 3 receiver recruit in Kyle Ford, two-sport standout and four-star prospect Drake London, and three-star Munir McClain, USC’s strongest position group is a Bru McCoy eligibility away from immediately becoming one of the best receiving units in the nation. When raving about his ability to pick up yards after the catch, head coach Clay Helton referred to St. Brown as “one of the best [wide receivers] in the country.” That should only draw attention away from the Trojans’ other potent options and allow Harrell to exploit overmatched defensive backs all season. With several legitimate weapons at the position, a step forward from Daniels combined with Harrell’s pass-heavy offense could make for a dominant Trojan receiving corps in the fall — especially if McCoy can contribute.   
Best newcomer: Freshman cornerback Chris Steele
Until USC receives word on McCoy’s status and receiver Kyle Ford gets fully healthy, the freshman cornerback transfer from the University of Florida is the highest-rated incoming Trojan playing this fall per 247Sports. After a chaotic past year which saw 2019’s No. 5-ranked cornerback commit to USC and transfer to two schools before returning to Southern Cal, the 6-foot-1 freshman has impressed his new coaching staff with his ability in fall camp. Many believe Steele still needs time to familiarize himself with USC’s defense, but Trojan coaches have remarked that Steele seems especially comfortable in practice after spending the entire spring in Gainesville. Meanwhile, the Trojans’ inexperience in the secondary has opened up a door for the newly-cleared Steele to slide into a starting role, and his athleticism should help him become an immediate difference-maker.
Most likely to break out: Sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin
Griffin will be counted upon to play a huge role in an alarmingly thin and inexperienced secondary for USC. After an injury-riddled freshman season and an offseason of slow recovery and rehab, Griffin is itching to get back on the field and show Trojan fans why he was the No. 4-ranked cornerback prospect in 2018’s recruiting class. Griffin, who has made a full recovery from offseason shoulder surgery, has impressed the coaching staff with numerous interceptions in fall camp and seems to be the Trojans’ most (and perhaps only) reliable corner heading into the season. All signs point toward Griffin establishing himself as an elite cornerback in USC’s most questionable position group in 2019.
Most important game: Week 4 vs. Utah
USC’s Week 4 tilt with the Utes at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum could be pivotal for the Trojans in several ways. For starters, it will decide if USC can push past the first six games of the schedule, which includes tough home matchups against Stanford and Utah and two extremely challenging road bouts against Washington and Notre Dame. If USC can take care of business against a Utah team that helped destroy its Pac-12 Championship aspirations last season, it will be in a much better position heading into the second half of its schedule. It would also go a long way in cooling the hot seat of head coach Clay Helton. Most importantly, the winner of the Pac-12 South could very well be determined by this matchup.

After an offseason filled with uncertainty, USC football once again finds itself preparing for another season. Following the unmitigated disaster of last year’s 5-7 season, expectations for the team are less certain than they have been in nearly two decades. 
With a new offensive coordinator in Graham Harrell and a roster that looks very different from that of last season, pinning down exactly what type of team the Trojans will be this year is a tough task. The first step toward finding out comes Saturday when the Trojans take on a Fresno State team that finished 12-2 and ranked No. 18 nationally at the end of last season.
TROJAN OFFENSE VS BULLDOG DEFENSE
Harrell has brought an entirely new offensive philosophy to USC, a spread passing game more akin to the Air Raid offenses prevalent across the college football landscape than to the pro-style offense USC has always employed. The offense will look to make things easier for the quarterback, simplifying route combinations and allowing for quicker reads.
USC’s wide receiving corps should also contribute greatly to making life easier for sophomore quarterback JT Daniels. Senior Michael Pittman Jr. looks primed to be one of the nation’s top receivers, while savvy route runner redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns and uber-gifted sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown also return as starters. 
The Trojans’ receiving depth does not end there — they also welcome back dangerous playmakers like sophomore Devon Williams and redshirt junior Velus Jones Jr. and have added talented freshmen like Munir McClain and Drake London.
However, this is not a pure Air Raid offense like that employed by head coach Mike Leach at Washington State. Harrell and Helton have both been clear about their intent to pound the ball on the ground as well — the run game doesn’t seem like it’s going to be an afterthought.
Expect both junior Stephen Carr and redshirt junior Vavae Malepeai to get significant reps at running back, and redshirt freshman running back Markese Stepp has had a phenomenal offseason. It’s possible for any of the three to lead the backfield in touches.
USC’s offensive line is one of the team’s biggest question marks this season, and the Fresno State front should offer a test to start the year. Although they ranked among the worst teams in the nation in sack rate, the Bulldogs were stout against the run last year, allowing the 30th-fewest rushing yards per game and the second-fewest rushing touchdowns.
The Bulldogs’ front seven is led by senior middle linebacker Mykal Walker, who was named to the All-Mountain West First Team last season. Behind him is a secondary in transition. The Bulldogs lost two starters there, yet their talented returners in the defensive backfield still make the unit Fresno State’s best defensive asset. Senior safety Juju Hughes and defensive back Jaron Bryant are both playmakers who made the Thorpe Award preseason watch list. The battle between that secondary and USC’s receivers should be one of the most entertaining matchups of the night.
TROJAN OFFENSE VS BULLDOG DEFENSE
Both of these units will be hard to pin down until we see them in action. Fresno State’s passing offense was one of the most efficient in the country last season, but quarterback Marcus McMaryion is gone, along with two of his top three receivers. The reins of the offense are now in the hands of senior quarterback Jorge Reyna, who has just 12 career pass attempts.
The Trojan secondary, although talented, is just as inexperienced — cornerbacks sophomore Olaijah Griffin and redshirt freshman Isaac Taylor-Stuart will be starting for the first time in their young careers, and safeties redshirt junior Isaiah Pola-Mao and sophomore Talanoa Hufanga have just seven starts between them. 
On the ground, Fresno State should be a middle-of-the-pack unit. Lead back junior Ronnie Rivers was effective last season — averaging a healthy 5.6 yards per game and scoring 10 touchdowns — yet he only accrued 132 carries. With the uncertainty surrounding the Bulldogs’ passing offense, don’t be too surprised to see them lean further on the run game this week then they did last year.
PREDICTION: 35-17, USC
Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Trojans, the raw talent on the roster should be more than enough to overcome a Fresno State team that lost most of its best performers from last year. The story would be different if this was last year’s Bulldog squad, but it isn’t. Expect the deficiencies of the Trojan roster to show — hiccups from Daniels, offensive line miscues and secondary blunders are likely to be noticeable Saturday. Even still, the talent of the new-look Trojans and their new direction as a team will likely be enough to overwhelm Fresno State.
