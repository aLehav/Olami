Sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey, senior center Khaled Holmes, senior defensive end Wes Horton and sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard were named to the preseason watch list for the Rotary Lombardi Award, the Rotary Club of Houston announced Monday afternoon.
The award is presented each year to the best lineman or linebacker in college football. Last year’s winner was Boston College linebacker Luke Kuechly, who selected by the Carolina Panthers in the top-10 of last April’s NFL draft.
If any of the four Trojans were to win the award, he would be the first USC player to do so and the first Pac-12 player since Arizona State’s Terrell Suggs in 2002.
As freshmen last season, Bailey and Pullard led the team in tackles with 81. Holmes and Horton have also provided steady leadership in recent years. Starting seven games in 2011 as a fourth-year junior, Horton finished with 22 tackles, along with four sacks.

The preseason accolades keep growing for sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey. The Lakewood, Calif., native has now been named to the watch list for the Butkus Award, the Butkus Foundation announced Monday.
The list is made up of 51 candidates for the award, which annually honors the nation’s top linebacker.
A season ago, Bailey finished with 81 tackles, two sacks and two interceptions, while being named Pac-12 Freshman Defensive Player of the Year. Bailey and fellow freshman linebacker Hayes Pullard were the first freshmen to lead USC in tackling since records were first kept in 1954. So far this offseason, he’s been named to the watch lists for the Chuck Bednarik and Bronko Nagurski Awards, which are both given to the top defensive player in all of college football.
Semifinalists for the Butkus Award will be announced on Oct. 22 and finalists unveiled on Nov. 20. Winners will be notified on, or before, Dec. 4, according to the release.
