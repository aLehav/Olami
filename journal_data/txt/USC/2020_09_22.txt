USC maintains a strong commitment to religious life, declaring in its mission statement that it is “pluralistic, welcoming outstanding men and women of every race, creed and background.” It also claims that it strives to teach students “moral discernment, understanding of self, and respect and appreciation for others.”
However, this summer’s events paint a far more complex picture. In July, a Muslim professor sued the University alleging religious harassment. In the wake of calls for the impeachment of former Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Rose Ritch, many Jewish organizations felt under attack.
In striving for religious inclusion and justice, USC must teach students to respect and appreciate world religions. To this end, the University should mandate a religious diversity course requirement for graduation.
Most American adults know little to nothing about world religions. A 2019 Pew Research Center questionnaire found that the average respondent answered less than half of the questions about world religions correctly. Had Pew included more questions about non-Christian world religions, this already-failing score would have likely been even worse; the average respondent correctly answered only a third of the questions for that category.
Underlying these abysmal results are gaping holes in the learning process. Religious education in the United States, both informal and formal, has routinely failed to present a fair and balanced narrative of world religions.
Most people learn about religion through their community or religious institution, which often projects their own values and worldview. Too often, they succumb to religious chauvinism, convinced of the superiority of their own worldview and incapable of critiquing their own. 
For example, many young evangelical Christians end up internalizing misconceptions, such as “morality only exists within the Bible.” Of course, this problem isn’t localized to one specific faith tradition; many religious communities tend to espouse similar assertions.
People also learn about religion through the news media, which almost exclusively presents the most extreme examples of religion. As a result, the public imaginary often views religion through blanket statements that are often problematic and fail to encompass the vast majority of religious adherents.
USC and other American higher education institutions have failed to correct these misconceptions. An Interfaith Youth Core survey of college students across 122 campuses found that only 32% of respondents believed that they had developed skills for interacting with people of diverse beliefs. Researcher Alyssa Rockenbach added that only 26% took a religious diversity course and only 9% underwent religious diversity training.
As a result, the average American’s knowledge of religion is not only limited but also skewed. Harvard Divinity professor Diane Moore claims that religious miseducation leads Americans to represent religious traditions inaccurately, ascribe undue expertise to clergy, conflate the study and practice of religion, view religion as static as opposed to evolving and interpret religion as a private affair separate from public life. The resulting misconceptions have serious implications on responsible citizenship in a pluralistic society.
Religious ignorance has serious business consequences. A 2013 Tannenbaum survey of American workers found that employees of companies that failed to offer flexible hours for religious observance were twice as likely to be uneager to go to work. And in 2015, 200 Muslim meatpacking workers staged a walkout after their plant failed to offer them a designated prayer room.
More concerningly, religious ignorance reduces the political power available to religious minorities. Throughout American history, public opinion has informally imposed its own religious tests on the presidency. Almost all U.S. presidents have been Protestant Christians, and the religion of non-Protestant candidates have almost always been a source of controversy.
Religious disempowerment also manifests in religiously-motivated hate crimes. The most salient example is the post-9/11 spike in Islamophobia; 481 hate crimes against Muslims happened in 2001 alone because people chose to blame the many for the actions of a few. Anti-Muslim hatred has continued beyond 2001; in 2016, a Muslim transit worker in New York City was pushed down the stairs and called a “terrorist” for wearing a hijab.
The solution to religious ignorance is religious literacy and the University must be part of that solution. It is no longer enough to preach religious diversity and leave students to their own devices. Rather, USC must ensure that students learn to recognize how religion has influenced society and to question blanket assumptions.
A religious diversity requirement may not end religious bigotry at the University, but it is a positive first step toward welcoming outstanding Trojans of every creed.

“You are so woke,” remarks one of my closest friends. 
Subsequently, I am catapulted into a double take. Is that a compliment or an insult, ironic or unironic? I think my friend means well, but do I want to be called “woke?” 
Woke culture has spent a considerable amount of time in the limelight lately, especially with its rise — or should I say trendiness — in the mainstream media earlier this year. Black boxes upon blank profile pictures upon aesthetic posts: Virtually, it was abnormal to not repost anything. 
One day, its momentum suddenly diminished. After all the #BlackoutTuesday posts, the appropriation of Breonna Taylor’s name into pop culture, the avows to change Aunt Jemima’s brand and the apologies for racist behavior in the past, optical allies started to move on. This time, however, it was okay to be complacent. After all, we are brandished with “wokeness” now, right?
While woke culture has its positive effects, white people have twisted it into a practice of performativity. Sure, a black screen projects solidarity and support for the Black Lives Matter movement, but what else does it accomplish? Ultimately, the emergence of woke culture has given white people an opportunity to practice optical allyship and exceptionalism. 
According to Merriam-Webster, woke culture actually originated in the Black community, with the term “stay woke” referring to those who were self-aware. After the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, the term became more associated with the Black Lives Matter movement and the awareness-raising of social justice issues. 
However, with the appropriation of this term by the white community, the phrase has become a medium of emblazoning “I’m one of the good ones” through meaningless methods of practicing allyship. “Wokeness” has turned into a compliment and a mode of instant gratification for doing the bare minimum. It has literally become trendy for white people to practice anti-racism because it makes us look good. 
I recently completed the “Me and White Supremacy” journaling challenge, in which author Layla Saad includes a chapter on optical allyship. Some specific examples she discusses are, “Bringing activism words and BIPOC images into your brand to make your business look more ‘woke’” and “Reading this book today because you secretly hope it will make you look more ‘woke.’” White exceptionalism and optical allyship go hand-in-hand, and they both revolve around woke culture. 
For more examples, we can look to pop culture — the removal of past racist episodes in “30 Rock,” Jimmy Fallon apologizing for blackface and Lady A changing its name (only to subsequently file a declaratory judgment lawsuit against Lady A, a Black singer in Seattle who already has the stage name). We wanted systemic change: defunding the police, abolition of mass incarceration and education equity, among other necessary policy changes. However, we incited performative wokeness instead. 
After completing this challenge, I cringe every time another white person refers to themself as “woke.” The term is thrown around freely, like instant doses of dopamine as a reward for educating oneself about issues they had the privilege of ignoring before it flooded their social media. Silence is violence, but optical allyship introduces a plethora of problems that make it just as harmful, if not worse. 
Wokeness is not a gold star to make white people feel better about historically oppressing marginalized communities, just like slapping a Band-Aid on an elbow won’t fix a broken arm. It is inherently counterintuitive to claim one wants to enact structural change, only to write “woke” across one’s forehead with a washable Crayola marker. 
We see this same level of superficiality with “cancel culture,” which is intended to hold people accountable for problematic behaviors. However, the media tosses it around like new slang, ultimately burying its original intention of calling in and calling out. We “cancel” so we can unsubscribe momentarily while whoever we “canceled” learns from their mistake and grows — not to prove our “wokeness.” For instance, J.K Rowling perpetuates harmful stereotypes about the transgender community, so we cancel her for being a TERF, or a trans-exclusionary radical feminist. 
Despite the existence of “cancel culture,” we will readily subvert it. I am talking to non-Black people who will acknowledge anti-Black companies but will still consume their products. I am talking to the “ally” who will order “How to be an Antiracist” from Amazon instead of a local bookstore.
Again, allyship is not an identity — it is a fluid practice. The purpose is to educate each other about how we continue to perpetuate white supremacy values. I highly recommend that every person with white privilege and white-passing privilege read “Me and White Supremacy” and actually complete the journaling challenge. 
I, myself, was guilty of exceptionalism and thought I could read the book without keeping a journal. Oh, how I was wrong, and I am continuing to learn how I am wrong every day. I would be embarrassed, but I am not because that’s normal. It’s something that society — and the Socratic method — has drilled into our heads since childhood: Without mistakes, we could not learn. 
At this point, seeking to garner clout through being “woke” is frankly embarrassing. The world has been too loud to not be an insomniac.

Amy Diamond will serve as USC’s chief investment officer, the University announced in a news release Tuesday. In her position, Diamond will oversee the Investment Office and USC’s $5.5 billion endowment. She is expected to assume the position Oct. 15. 
Diamond succeeds the University’s first chief investment officer Lisa Mazzacco, who was appointed in 2011. She previously worked at Northwestern University’s Investment Office for more than 20 years as managing director of private investments and real assets. Diamond also served as a senior team member overseeing Northwestern’s $11 billion endowment. 
“While it is difficult to say goodbye to the Northwestern family, it is a great honor and privilege to join the leadership team at one of the world’s top private research universities,” Diamond said in the news release. “I look forward to helping build upon the success that the investment office has achieved in support of USC’s mission.”
Diamond will also serve as part of President Carol Folt’s senior leadership team and work alongside Chief Financial Officer James Staten. In her position, she will also advise the Board of Trustees investment committee. 
At Northwestern, Diamond served on advisory boards for more than 35 investment managers and held leadership positions in annual asset allocation and risk management. Alongside her various roles, Diamond also worked closely with Northwestern’s financial operations on liquidity planning and in the university’s sale of pharmaceutical patent royalty interests. She also served as a founding board member of Lending for Evanston and Northwestern Development, a student-run nonprofit that allocates microloans and training to small businesses. 
Before her tenure at Northwestern, Diamond worked as an equity research analyst and led investment banking coverage for companies in energy industries and health care services. 
“Amy Diamond is well known for her leadership in higher education investment,” Folt said in the release. “Her ability to navigate the complexities of portfolio management will help ensure a financially sustainable future for the USC community.”

During quarantine this summer, some people learned to bake sourdough bread while others delved into Animal Crossing. But for Cherise Cayetano, a senior majoring in law, history and culture, quarantine boredom inspired her to share her commentary on current events including the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement and casual topics such as “Avatar” with a comedic twist on her podcast “CC’Me.” 
Interest in creating her own podcast piqued following an event she helped organize with the Latinx Student Assembly and the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment in 2018. The event invited creators of the Bitter Brown Femmes podcast, a show that tackles emotional, social and political issues involving the Latinx/Chicanx community. Asking the creators about their personal inspiration — the question inspired by a tweet she saw that mentioned how “everyone is one bad day away from starting their own podcast” — the experience solidified her desire that she often mentioned to her friends. 
Cayetano was recently motivated to create “CC’Me” and its first episode to share her thoughts and experiences involving BLM, particularly after noticing many of her friends on social media choosing to ignore the movement or solely posting a singular black square to show their solidarity. Following the first podcast, Cayetano decided to take a more casual approach and create more episodes about lighter subjects.
“The first episode was really serious,” Cayetano said. “Then the rest of them was just me having fun with my friends because people don’t really allow Black women to have that side of [having fun]. I don’t want everything to be about the hardships of the Black community.”
There are currently four episodes available for listeners, ranging from discussions on the free labor Black women are often expected to put toward educating individuals on anti-Blackness, to lighthearted conversations about “Avatar” and One Direction. 
Senior Naomi Andrews, who participated in the first episode discussing the free labor of Black women, said Cayetano saw the podcast as a way to be productive with her time during the summer and start conversations about topics that are important to talk about. 
“Just seeing all this chaos of going on about like what it meant to be Black in America… It’s kind of stressful to be constantly consuming that content,” said Andrews, who is majoring in sociology. “If [Cherise or I] would post something on Instagram, people would swipe up and ask questions. That led us into doing [the work to answer their questions] — when Google is there — because we feel obligated to answer. So we discussed, ‘Why do people feel like they deserve to be educated, when answers are typically readily available?’”
Though the first episode was more social-justice focused, Cayetano aims to have the podcast cover a variety of topics.
As a new podcast creator, Cayetano took responsibility for designing the cover art, featuring a teacup and cherries, with the concept of spilling “quaran-tea” during the pandemic. Due to social distancing measures preventing Cayetano from meeting with guests in person, she uses Zoom to record their conversations. Though internet connection issues sometimes arise, Cayetano said she uses iMovie to increase the volume and stabilize background noise to improve the listening experience.
“I’m also a bit of a perfectionist,” Cayetano said. “So, sometimes I’ll edit it, and then I’ll listen to it for a good five times before I’m like, ‘Okay, I’ve done all that I can do.”
For Cayetano, the greatest challenge with running her podcast is the planning process. In preparation for each episode, Cayetano will research the topic and watch content made by other creators on different platforms so the information will be fresh in her mind. Sometimes, she’ll frame discussion questions to keep herself and her friends on track, while still keeping an easygoing tone. Cayetano said she also prefers recording episodes with her friends as guest speakers because she believes they have more to contribute to topics as a group compared to if she were to speak alone.
“I thought I’d be nervous, but we just do it on Zoom,” said Andrews, who also participated as a guest for the “Avatar” episode. “It feels like … we’re just hanging out. There’s really not that much pressure for it to be [a certain way]. Usually the topics that we talk about are the kind of stuff that we already have experience with, so we don’t have to worry about running out of things to say, or worry about following a script.” 
When researching topics for her podcast, Cayetano said she gets most of her inspiration from her conversations with her friends, which is helpful when she’s looking for guest speakers. Since she knows which of her acquaintances have knowledge on each topic, it makes it easier for her to find co-hosts who have strong opinions to contribute to the conversation.
“Sometimes, my friends will be talking about something and they bring something up, [I’ll write] a little note of just ideas that I have and the people who brought them up,” Cayetano said. “If they want to expand on it, I know who to ask.”
When she planned an episode celebrating One Direction’s 10th anniversary, she immediately knew she wanted to ask her friend and fellow Directioner Sullyari Bautista, a senior majoring in political science, to co-host the episode. 
Cayetano texted Bautista, inviting her to speak on her podcast and share her memories and passion for One Direction. Though Bautista was initially nervous to speak on the podcast since she never had her voice recorded before, she was quickly able to relax when chatting with Cayetano.
“It’s very natural,” Bautista said. “We join Zoom together and … let the conversation flow to talk about our personal experiences. At times, I really did forget that we were recording, and I had to mute myself from laughing.”
For future podcast episodes, Cayetano said she has a variety of ideas lined up just waiting to be explored. Some of them include more casual episodes like listening parties and album reviews, as well as more informative episodes, such as conversations on sexual health. Recently, she’s been watching “The Legend of Korra” and planning a podcast giving her commentary on the nostalgic series. For now, Cayetano looks to keep her options open with the podcast and enjoy getting together with friends on Thursday nights to record on Zoom.
“Cherise is a very open, talkative and warm person, and she’s very funny. I think that she was probably inspired by her very funny thoughts to start a podcast and share her warm, fun energy with a bunch of other people,” Bautista said. “I think she wants to continue the podcast and hopefully make it into something more regular and bigger, to reach greater audiences.”

I switch the mode on my camera from autofocus to manual focus, and just like that, I receive the freedom to completely and single-handedly compose the perfect image — if perfection did exist. 
There are two main types of focusing when it comes to photography: autofocus and manual focus. In the former, the camera drives the decision making — it tells you what the most important part of the subject is and chooses what area to focus with just a click of a button. The latter, however, lets the user drive behind the steering wheel, permitting them to choose for themselves what to pay attention to and what to focus on. 
How do I know this? Well, I’m a photographer myself.
Using manual focus has changed my portrait game. I now control the key part in photography: the focusing. Without getting caught up in the way my camera frames a certain setting, I consciously pick and choose how to snap the shot. I look through my lens with a wide perspective and analyze every minute detail before clicking the release button. 
Manual focus grants me the ability to think freely — a freedom society at times forbids. 
The autofocus option on most cameras parallels society’s framing of certain discourses. From the normalization of the fox eye trend (goodbye!) in the beauty industry, to incorrectly labeling R&B as “urban” in the music industry to the corrupt and performative political discourse all around us, society, and more specifically the media, tells us how we should think, what we should do and how we should behave. Oftentimes, this framing blurs out crucial details and hides differing opinions. Proven by researchers studying media effects, media framing and priming alter the way we perceive news, events and people. 
It blinds us from being unprejudiced and nonjudgmental individuals. We need a real-life manual focus option before our current polarized discourse heightens. And here lies the point of my column: Together, we must make room for incorporating 360-degree thinking and other soft skills into our everyday repertoire. This soft skill — such as empathy and open-mindedness, among others — fundamentally builds this real-life manual focus, as I like to call it. 
Before I get ahead of myself, let me explain what I’m talking about. 
About a year ago, in my first year of college, I took a transformative class that completely reshaped the lens through which I view the world. Once a week on Wednesday evening, I left my “Professional Effectiveness: Building a Career through Third Space Thinking” class having learned something new. “This class provides students with a communication-driven analytic framework, along with knowledge that will help them identify and take advantage of opportunities in today’s digital, distributed media-rich society,” the first line in the syllabus read. And trust, so it did. 
While the class focuses on educating students on five soft skills, named Third Space attributes, so that they may gain an upper hand in the business world, these skills — adaptability, cultural competency, empathy, intellectual curiosity and 360-degree thinking — can be just as easily applied anywhere else. For this article, let me draw your attention to the lattermost skill: 360-degree thinking. 
“[360-degree thinking] takes a holistic, multi-dimensional, analytical approach to problem-solving,” the Center for Third Space Thinking website reads. “[It is] able to convert information into insights, infer implications from data and extrapolate from data to real-world applications and engage in sense-making by ‘connecting the dots.’” 
In other words, this skill makes you think holistically; it prompts you to understand the full scale of a problem across time and multiple areas, recognize patterns and make reliable conclusions based on those patterns. To illustrate just how powerful of a tool this is and to drive home my point, let’s analyze the coronavirus pandemic with this lens. 
Last week, the public learned from reporter Bob Woodward that President Donald Trump was aware of the serious threat posed by the coronavirus in early February and purposefully downplayed it for the past few months. “I wanted to always play it down,” Trump said to Woodward. “I still like playing it down … because I don’t want to create a panic.” It’s funny how we have a magnanimous amount of data on the coronavirus outbreak, yet a decent percent of the American population listens to Trump because of his “presidential authority.” 
Blinded by Trump’s framing, and that of respective news outlets, people overlook facts such as how at least 199,636 people have died in the United States alone, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Sitting comfortably with ignorance, some of us refuse to “infer implications from data” and “engage in sense-making by connecting the dots” — aspects of 360-degree thinking. 
This needs to change. 
Applying a 360-degree thinking lens when composing a certain “shot,” or, more accurately, reaching a certain conclusion or belief provides you and me with the freedom manual focus gives to photographers. We see the whole picture the way we think is best. 
Taking everything into account before reaching a conclusion, soft skills like 360-degree thinking clear the lens through which we view current events, politics and trends. I firmly believe that this is vital to creating progress in a society that is so divided. Instead of focusing on how the media frames topics and what our politicians tell us, let’s begin to use this real-life manual focus in hopes of tackling some of the biggest challenges society faces collectively.
Here’s to not taking blurry pictures when it isn’t intentionally for the aesthetic.

Belligerent. Scary. Fearsome. Rude. Abrasive. Antagonistic. These are the words one would expect to use when describing a monster or something of the sort, but no. In this case, these are the words used to describe Black women. In the entertainment industry, there’s a sort of one-dimensionality associated with Black women on television and in film. It seems that the one emotion many are written to have is excessive anger, thus the Angry Black Woman trope is born. 
Though there are many different reasons the “Angry Black Woman” is alive and well, this stereotype got its start in the entertainment realm long ago, and under a completely different name: the Sapphire. Its namesake is Sapphire Stevens, a Black woman who demeaned and belittled her Black husband on the minstrel-style radio show turned sitcom “The Amos ‘n Andy Show,” created by two white men, by the way. 
This stereotype, which started as a Black woman angrily targeting Black men, quickly became the Black woman who was angry all the time. The entertainment industry saw its success and ran with it: Kim Parker from “Moesha,” Helen from “Drake and Josh,” Cookie from “Empire,” Rochelle (Chris’ mom) from “Everybody Hates Chris,” Madea from almost every Tyler Perry movie, the list goes on. And while many entertainment reporters don’t talk about it, I think it’s time, so who better to speak on the issue than Black women majoring in various aspects of the film industry at USC?
In media, we see, as described earlier, the ill-tempered, arrogant and sassy Black woman, but it’s not just a Black woman issue; it’s a dark-skinned Black woman issue. I’ve found that as people described the ABW stereotype in entertainment media, darker-skinned women were always the characters portraying it. Aziza Hutcherson, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies, explained her interpretation of the Angry Black Woman as such.
“They are not portrayed accurately because darker-skinned women are seen as aggressive or angry or not being delicate and feminine enough to play these certain roles,” Hutcherson said. “So that’s something that I’ve noticed … and definitely is not okay and should be called out … every chance it comes up.” 
(The ABW works hand in hand with the concept of colorism and lighter-skinned women being portrayed daintier because they were closer to white … but that’s another story.) 
But, it’s not only fictional media that curates the ABW stereotype, this trope is inescapable even in the lives of actual Black women. Non-Black people and Black men alike tend to take the stereotypical behavior of Black women on TV and film and shape their own perceptions of real women as such. This, in turn, has forced Black women to be over-cognizant of how they act in social situations, including Sasha-Mylan Williams, a sophomore majoring in interactive media and game design. 
“I do think sometimes I feel like I do have to dial it back, so I can come off to strangers or people who I just meet as a nice person instead of just going in as my normal, definitive self,” Williams said. “Until I get confirmation like, ‘Oh, this is a safe place for me.’”
And with this overanalyzing of character comes an unspoken code that many Black women seem to encounter in their lives: One shouldn’t show any vulnerability. The idea of any kind of weakness is deemed not acceptable, especially when it’s captured in films and on TV. 
For example, in the Tyler Perry movie “Madea’s Family Reunion” the protagonist, Lisa (Rochelle Aytes), tells her mother how her fiance was abusing her. Her mother, surprised, responds saying that she should “stop doing whatever it is that you’re doing to make him angry.” Lisa is then expected to carry on as if nothing occurred and push through the arranged marriage. This feeds into the stereotype that Black women are encouraged to dismiss their problems and continue with a strong persona. This perpetuated idea can have many outward effects on how Black women interact and can create chronic anxiety disorders.
Sophomore Ariann Barker, majoring in screenwriting, explained that many of their peers expected them always to have the tough or comic-relief persona, so the instance they sought console, their peers found it so out of the ordinary, they disappeared. 
“The second that I actually wanted a friend to be there for me — in a time that wouldn’t be putting on a show for them or something that they just have to consume without really being a part of — it was curtains and nobody,” Baker said.
As detrimental as this widely accepted stereotype is in social situations, it also impedes on perceptions of Black women in the professional realm, more specifically, casting. In the case of sophomore Dara Adedara, majoring in theatre with an acting emphasis, while growing up, she was never the main character, and if she was, it was always the antagonist. 
“I’ve never been, you know, the main character,” Adedara said. “If it was ‘Cinderella,’ I would have never been Cinderella. I would have been the evil stepsister. If there was ‘The Little Mermaid,’ I would have been Ursula. It’s always been those types of roles that have kind of been given to me.” 
Similarly, Kennedy Hill, a sophomore majoring in acting for the stage, screen and new media, conveyed that while she has been asked by directors to play up Black stereotypes, she wants to be defined by her ability, not her race. 
“I’m the only Black woman in my cohort,” Hill said. “[The directors] have seen my work enough that I think I’ve kind of pushed that narrative off. I’m extremely talented, I can play whatever you give me, don’t… perceive me [like] the stereotype.”
Although this stereotype is deeply ingrained in our society, there still should be a feasible way to reform it. Many Black women have said the way it should be changed is by allowing the diverse stories of Black women to be told. 
“There’s no one way to be a Black woman,” Hill said. “We have to constantly go against the grain and show ‘I’m the awkward Black girl. I’m the edgy Black girl. I’m the Black girl that skates. I’m the Black girl that listens to Taylor Swift’ … Just because I’m Black doesn’t mean that I have to stick to your certain lens of myself.” 
In the same vein, other Black women, including Williams, want to stray away from the tragic plots we normally see like police brutality, gang violence and poverty. She hopes to create films where Black women get to be in stories never before seen. 
“We don’t need to see that story told because we lived it,” Williams said. “Let’s see a story that not everyone gets to see where white people get to be quirky, fall in love, go on adventures, be the hero and all this, and it’s like [for Black people], ‘I got shot by a police officer, or I experienced slavery. And that’s my story.’”
If white audiences can see a movie where they are represented in every space, Black audiences should as well. While there are large franchises like “Harry Potter” and “Lord of the Rings,” Black women have yet to be seen and popularized in that realm, which many find aggravating. 
“I’ve never seen a Black female in a fantasy world,” Williams said. “I’ve never seen a made-up fictional fantasy world where she’s a wizard … fighting some dark evil force that isn’t a white man police officer.”
Black women in media shouldn’t be forced into the angry box and should be given layers like every other person. It’s never been about keeping a type of character alive, it’s about perpetuating harmful cliches, and it’s time for the entertainment industry to take notes. Must be the reason Issa Rae’s “Insecure” is so refreshing, huh?

“USC professor no longer teaching after using Chinese word that sounds like racial slur.” This was the notorious headline that delivered the news that Greg Patton, a professor at USC Marshall School of Business, had been placed on leave after several students in his class complained to the administration of his use of a Chinese word that sounds like the n-word.
It’s no question that the n-word is blatantly racist and dehumanizing. It’s a disgusting reference to the violent, ever-relevant history of slavery and discrimination against Black people in the United States. Therefore, it’s also no question that non-Black people should not say the n-word. So, had Patton said the n-word, it would be grounds for his immediate dismissal from the University.
However, he didn’t say the n-word. He said 那个 (pronounced nà ge or neì ge), which is the Chinese word for “that” and is, as Patton explained in his lecture, commonly used as a filler word similar to and with the frequency that someone might use “like,” “um” or “err” in English. 
Essentially, Patton was placed on leave for speaking Chinese. The headline could have just as easily been “USC professor no longer teaching after using Chinese,” and it would have just as accurately summed up the situation. The University’s response to the situation was unacceptable, and Patton should be reinstated promptly.
In Marshall Dean Geoffrey Garrett’s email explaining the situation, he said that, “It is simply unacceptable for faculty to use words in class that can marginalize, hurt and harm the psychological safety of our students.” Because the word in question is 那个 and not the n-word, this implies that the Chinese language in itself is something that “marginalizes, hurts and harms,” which is no doubt offensive to those who speak it. 
那个 lacks the racist connotation that makes the n-word unacceptable to use by non-Black people. The Chinese language has existed for thousands of years, and because it is its own language entirely separate from English, it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that there are words in it that mean entirely different things than English words. Perhaps Patton would’ve done better with a different communications lecture: homophones versus synonyms. Even if 那个 may sound like the n-word, it shares neither etymological origin nor meaning with it. 
In their email to the administration, the students in Patton’s class said that 那个 “should be carefully used, especially in the context of speaking Chinese within the social context of the United States.” If you’re going to be offended by someone saying 那个 in the context of the U.S., you should be pacified when you consider that they were saying 那个 in the context of a communications lecture on filler words. 
The Chinese language doesn’t even need to be contextualized in the first place, but if you’re going to attempt to do it anyways, remember that the “social context of the U.S.” is defined by the fact that it’s multicultural and multilingual. Immigrants account for 13.7% of the population, and as of 2015, there were at least 350 languages spoken in the U.S. This country has historically been referred to as the “melting pot” of the globe, priding itself on its acceptance of diverse peoples. Whether it’s really accepting is questionable at best, but that’s a conversation for another time. 
USC is no different. While it could certainly do better — especially concerning its appalling underrepresentation of Black students — in the 2019-20 academic year, USC boasted an international student population of 25.4% of the total student population. Many more aren’t only American and speak languages other than English. 
Why should Chinese speakers have to tread carefully around speaking their own language because an English speaker might misinterpret it for something it’s not? At this point, it’s starting to sound no different than those Karens who insist that people must speak English in the U.S. That’s pretty rich coming from a country that has no official language. 
The world doesn’t revolve around the U.S or the English language. Chinese speakers shouldn’t be forced to erase a word from their language because American English speakers said so. Even if they did, it’s not going to promote racial equity in any way. 
Patton’s suspension was purely performative and falls far short of condemning discrimination against Black students. As a member of the Class of 2024 said in a submission to @black_at_usc on Instagram, “It’s ridiculous and genuinely upsetting that, of all the actual racist actions and microaggressions that have been reported, this is conveniently the situation where USC chooses to take action.” In their haste to put up a progressive front, USC responded to the situation in a way that not only marginalized Chinese speakers but also took attention away from incidents of actual offense against Black students.
The administration’s attempt to be anti-racist missed the mark completely. In fact, it really went in circles. Making speaking Chinese punishable goes against the very diversity that USC claims to strive for. It sends the message that the Chinese language and, by extension, Chinese students don’t belong at USC, which is already unfortunately a theme in the U.S. due to the uptick of xenophobia in the wake of the pandemic. We can fight for racial justice for Black people without being racist toward other marginalized communities. God knows, people from underrepresented groups need to work together now more than ever if systemic racism in the U.S. is to be eradicated.

To imagine a world without internet or smartphones can be a bit of a doozy for millenials as well as members of Generation Z and the now-growing Generation Alpha. At the same time, a world where I could also walk outside without seeing the Bladerunner 2049 filter over my head or worrying about exposure to an incredibly deadly virus would also be a challenge to picture.
Probably best to stay inside for the time being — take the hint, partygoers. 
That being said, the coronavirus pandemic and virtual workspace have generated an exponential increase in collective screen time worldwide. And while your professor is still trying to figure out how to set up breakout rooms for your group discussion — or lack thereof — let’s break down this idea of the virtual space specifically in the context of older adults. 
With all these seniors stuck inside, this technological boom of sorts has forced older adults to begin using the plethora of gadgets and gizmos that the “kids these days” use — or has it?
It’s easy to assume your parents, grandparents, teachers and older people fall under this umbrella stereotype of cluelessness or ignorant bliss when it comes to technology. Developmental changes that come with age do not necessarily include a growing distaste for technology, rather, this stereotype stems from the ageist image of older adults being confused, frail and “stuck in their ways.” In fact, the number of seniors using technology has been increasing at a good pace years before the pandemic took place.
The Pew Research Center divides the current generation of older Americans — those 65 and older — into two simple groups: those who are involved and aware of technology’s benefits and those who are disconnected from the digital world. 
“So, Lois,” you say. “There are clearly older adults who outright dislike technology. How do you explain that second group of older adults? It can’t just be that they want to learn about technology but just aren’t sure how to go about it.” Well, actually, yes, that is the case for many older adults. 
The dilemma that exists between older adults and technology clearly doesn’t manifest in the stereotype that older adults hate or despise new gadgets — if anything, they want to learn about these appliances and how to use them for their own benefit just like their younger counterparts. But when you combine a quickly changing environment with a lack of knowledge in navigating the vast waters of the internet, you can piece together the puzzle that many companies from Silicon Valley are just now figuring out. Let’s do some gerontology mythbusting.
Older people enjoy using social media, with about a third of them in the United States reporting that they are active on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. As mentioned earlier, younger seniors were shown to be more active than older seniors, but the message still stands. Additionally, over two-thirds of older adults have said that they use the internet quite often, whether that be to skim the news or keep up with popular figures. I’d be failing here if I didn’t mention the multitude of older adult influencers on TikTok and Instagram such as Lynn Davis of “Cooking with Lynja” and fashion designer Jenny Kee.
For some older adults, the issue of privacy plays a massive role in determining their receptiveness to using a platform like Facebook or an appliance such as Alexa, both of which have had their own respective privacy concerns in the past few years. Here, it really becomes about education and teaching ways to balance efficiency and security.
News sources have taken to social media platforms to showcase breaking news and daily or weekly highlights. I have to admit, as co-chief copy editor, there have been times when even my own older relatives referenced some “sketchy” or “fishy” websites in our family group conversations. While we all probably had that teacher (or teachers) who warned us about using Wikipedia because it could be publicly edited, an abundance of this generation’s older adults never had that conversation — not because they didn’t care, but because it was not something that they had to really concern themselves with at the time. 
And while all of this is happening, some of our friends in the tech sector seem to have decided that simplicity is completely overrated: seriously, who needs that many buttons on the damn TV remote? To digital natives, maybe something like setting up Apple TV or bluetooth headphones can be incredibly mundane. But for folks who may not be so familiar with tech terms or figuring out labeless buttons, these tasks can feel like puzzles where all the pieces are the same color. 
Organizations geared toward the education of older adults on technology continue to grapple with new ways to promote outreach and involvement. For instance, USC’s GeroTech — one of the few groups on campus that strives to promote intergenerational events on technology — works with the Emeriti Center and other older adults in the local community who are interested in making the best of the appliances and platforms they have at home. Intergenerational phone chains like the one at USC also have been an incredibly helpful tool in providing company for older adults, even if it may be through a simple five-minute chat.
It is also important to realize that while older adults may experience subtle physiologic changes with age — vision and hearing impairment decline and tremors, among other things — these effects do not necessarily entail cognitive decline and should each be accounted for in the development of technology. Additionally, we have to realize that while a majority of research papers and data simply account for “older adults,” that the group does not simply allude to wheelchair-rocking grandmas and grandpas but also includes active and outgoing seniors along with some older members of Generation X now experiencing some physiological changes related to aging.
Issues pertaining to social isolation due to the inability to connect with family and friends in person have detrimentally affected the older adult population. This makes it all the more important to help streamline and shorten the learning curve when it comes to figuring out new pieces of technology. 
Even when it comes to how we perceive technology visually, we scarcely see any commercials from Apple or Microsoft with grandma or grandpa browsing Youtube or TikTok. In fact, AARP found that less than 5% of images listed under the search term “older people” show them with any form of technology. Simply put, if your interpretation of grandma and grandpa using Alexa is anything similar to the Amazon Alexa Silver skit on Saturday Night Live, we got some work to do. 
At the end of the day, we’re going to be face-to-face with the iPhone 100 down the road, whether we like it or not, reminiscing about when we got our first iPhone and saying, “Back in my day…”

From his distinctive style to his creative vision, South Central native creative, rapper and songwriter Duckwrth discussed his latest 16-track album “Super Good” released via Republic Records Aug. 21 and how his past has both influenced and informed his creativity. 
Since the 2015 release of his debut album “Nowhere,” Duckwrth has been influencing the alternative R&B and hip-hop sound everywhere. Rising in popularity, Duckwrth has toured with artists such as Billie Eilish and Anderson .Paak. 
Tuning in with his screen name set as “VOLDEMORT,” Duckwrth joined in for a virtual press conference with the Universal Music Group °1824 team. 
Duckwrth, now 32 years old, knew from a young age that he was destined to pursue an artistic field. He mentioned how one day, when he was little and attending church, a woman came up to him and put her hand on his shoulder to tell him that there was a calling on his life. 
Duckwrth explains how what she said always stuck with him, and through the making of “Super Good,” he learned that he was only as strong as the people around him. 
“This album was very much a village,” Duckwrth said. “It was a collective creation.”
Taking inspiration from the chord progressions in the music of soul, jazz and gospel, Duckwrth always seems to blend multiple genres from funk to hip-hop to R&B seamlessly. 
“It’s never that I’m trying to blend them,” Duckwrth said. “I think if I had a superpower, it would be to take what’s happening in the outside world and be able to take it in and regurgitate it out, you know, so it’s never like I intentionally want to mix this punk track with like this gospel track, [it just happens].”
As far as performance goes, the rapper strictly takes inspiration from punk and thrasher because, as he explains, it helps get the fire started and creates a hardcore angle to his performance.  
Even with a strong artistic vision, Duckwrth recognizes that dropping a project during the pandemic can be both frightening and exciting. The rapper feels “surprisingly relieved” that it’s finally out in the world. 
“When you press play, it’s supposed to make you feel super good,” Duckwrth said. “I feel like it came right on time where people need to feel the best that they can at this moment, so I feel relieved.”
Finishing all the songs on “Super Good” in January before the pandemic hit the United States with full force and quarantine orders were put in place, Duckwrth felt, more than ever, excited and motivated for the new decade.
“My thoughts and ideas of it was so much more different from the 2020 that we know now,” Duckwrth said. 
When asked about how his creative process has changed during the pandemic, Duckwrth said he’s having “a crazy amount” of writer’s block at the moment. 
“I think mainly because it’s been a really crazy year so I don’t think my artistry needed as much love as my human did, like this year became a year of survival,” Duckwrth said. 
About the intent and vision for “Super Good,” Duckwrth said a lot of it was meant to tell a story and take you out of your current situation. But the overarching theme of the album is to make listeners feel good. 
“It’s like audio medicine pretty much,” Duckwrth said. 
Taking on jazz and soul influences from the ’70s, Duckwrth wants people to dance, groove, bop and move to “Super Good.” He wants the album to be a lifestyle project — one people will listen to in the car or while taking a shower. 
“It’s really up to the listeners,” Duckwrth said. … “All I can do is just, you know, create it.” 
The songwriter mentioned that the most challenging song to write in the album was “New Love Song,” which samples a song called “Jesus Is A Love Song” by the Clark Sisters, a gospel vocal group of five sisters.
After recording the rap part of “New Love Song” and the bridge, Duckwrth sat on it for three weeks, figuring out how to finish it. He found a girl group to sing in it and give respect to the Clark Sisters. 
“I wanted to kind of give a nod to gospel music because that’s some of the early music that I remember from my childhood,” Duckwrth said.
Growing up in L.A. in the ’90s and early 2000s was beautiful and always sunny, Duckwrth said. Yet despite the city feeling like a utopia, there was a lot of trauma that came with it, which heavily influenced his artistry and business mindsets. 
“It’s a lot of gang activity that’s happened in the ’90s,” Duckwrth said. “So a lot of my youth was learning how to survive, whether that be, you know, by ducking bullets [or] like drive-bys.” 
Duckwrth recalls the trauma he experienced and how it shaped him.
“Diamonds come from, you know, the roughest type of situation so I think by being raised specifically in South Central Los Angeles, it gave me a backbone,” Duckwrth said. “So like when I deal with corporate America, I don’t take no bullshit, you know, because like I learned how to survive.”
Duckwrth noted that his biggest musical influence is OutKast, an American hip-hop duo from the South that formed in 1992. 
“As a young person that was in South Central, they showed me that there’s a different type of being a Black creative,” Duckwrth said. “They’ve always just inspired me, not just musically but just as a person who is different, I would say. I want to do that for this generation.”
As a creative, Duckwrth draws inspiration from the ’70s, which he describes as being colorful and beautiful, inspiring his vision for the cover art for “Super Good.” 
“I really like the ’70s,” Duckwrth said. “Especially for Black people [it] was a time of celebration. We just came out of civil rights, and Black people [were] starting to gain certain freedoms and, you know, it was [a] celebration. So within that, when Black people start going back into who they are in their original like essence, a bit of magic happens.”
Duckwrth wants to tap into that magic as he believes we’re coming into that same energy in the 2000s, 2010s and 2020. 
Regarding his perspective on racism and politics in 2020, Duckwrth stated that everything happens for a reason. 
“I’m hoping that things work out better, but I’m also preparing for when things get worse,” Duckwrth said. “But every storm is temporary and we will eventually get through it and we’ll get to a better place.”
One of the most important things for Duckwrth as an artist is maintaining authenticity. From his music to his appearance, he feels that artistic creativity is embedded in his DNA.

A couple of weeks ago, I scrolled through Twitter and saw that College Gameday was trending on my feed, and it hit me that college football was finally underway for other conferences. I wanted to see which teams were beginning to play and went onto ESPN only to see major programs such as Oklahoma, Texas and Miami selling tickets.
I was aware that some NFL teams (looking at you, Kansas City Chiefs) include fans at a limited capacity, but it surprised me that colleges are considering the same thing. As I wrote about in my previous column, keeping student-athletes safe is a whole different story from maintaining the same level of security for professionals. NFL teams solely function around the sport of football, while schools have educational and scholarship commitments such as providing students an adequate education through distance learning and supporting staff members who are facing financial hardship during these difficult times. Having to worry about football on top of these existing responsibilities will create more work for universities. 
On the same note, student-athletes are college students first, so they have to keep up with classes and do not have a salary contingency for staying safe compared to their professional counterparts. Including a fan base made up of older alumni at student-athlete events increases the risk of exposure even more.
I want to dig a bit deeper and see to what extent universities are implementing safety protocols at games. 
One college I looked into was the University of Oklahoma. Ranked No. 3 in the nation for college football, the Sooners wanted their season to occur. I checked out its policies for fans this season and what it came up with for their home games the next couple of months was expected. 
The Oklahoma football website says that the program is planning to reduce capacity by 25% to almost 20,000 fans at an 80,000 person stadium in Norman, Oklahoma this season. That number still seems like a lot, but fans should be able to practice proper safety measures, as they are enforcing strict gameday policies such as spacing between seats, mandatory masks, sanitation, cashless payments and, most importantly, no tailgating. 
In theory, it may work out. However, as we have seen throughout this pandemic, nothing is a guarantee. Knowing how irrational and self-centered people have been acting during these times, there will be parties and other out-of-game gatherings. It will be critical for universities and anybody allowing fans into stadiums to ensure that any policies they enact will accompany extensive oversight and enforcement to ensure the virus doesn’t spread as a result of their games.
Health experts have highlighted the need for attendee safety as the college football season continues, especially on the topic of seating and distance during the game. 
“[Allowing] as few people as possible is one first step to opening up and then, maybe opening up with only a proportion of the seats available for sale … so people can be spaced out,” said Dr. Eleanor Murray, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University’s School of Public Health, to ESPN. “[Going from that to] sort of gradually going back up to a full stadium, I think, would be the ideal from a sort of epidemiological perspective.”
It is also important to account for travel. Most fans don’t live right by the stadium, so they have to drive some distance to get there, and any stops they make along the way will potentially spread the coronavirus even more. 
For instance, our favorite rivals from South Bend, Indiana are limiting attendance to 20%. What’s worse about Notre Dame’s situation is that its campus is 1.5 hours away from the Chicago metropolitan area, whose 9.5 million population has been severely impacted by the virus. So any fans traveling through that area have a higher chance of contracting the virus.
In the end, it seems like universities are taking enough health precautions to allow a limited number of fans to enter their stadiums. Although it seems innovative and changes the fan experience even after the pandemic, it is still unclear if this will help keep attendees, staff and ultimately players safe.
Obviously, for Pac-12 California schools and any schools in major cities — including the University of Washington in Seattle — allowing fans is not viable due to the high number of cases in these areas. On the other hand, schools in less populated areas — like Oregon State — can consider bringing a limited number of fans back to games. 
What is important, however, is that if Pac-12 football comes back this fall and some schools decide to reopen stadiums for fans, there must be strict precautions outside of the stadium gates. If any of the players from schools in major cities like USC or UCLA catch the virus when they travel to other schools, that will cause more trouble when they return home. 
Another possibility is requiring  fans to test negative for the virus before entering games, and implementing a policy where fans who have tested positive or exhibit symptoms must be prohibited from entering. 
Overall, as the Big 10 and possibly the Pac-12 are looking to restart their seasons this fall and join the rest of these conferences, the important question that universities need to answer is if all these policies are worth the risk of further spreading the virus.
If the schools do not prioritize safety, then allowing back fans will continue the spread of transmission into local communities across the nation and can put all of the collegiate sports seasons on hold for this year if many players and staff also contract the virus.

The Viterbi School of Engineering launched Reverse-Engineering Engineering Education this fall, a program where student trainers design and deliver storytelling seminars to professors and freshmen to provide an outlet for engineering students to discuss their identities, stories and culture to promote empathy. 
According to Viterbi Vice Dean of Diversity and Strategic Initiatives Brandi Jones, the purpose of the program is to create a culture for both students and instructors within the field of engineering focused on experiential learning, mattering and support.
The program is offered through Freshman Academy, a first-year course that grants new Viterbi students the opportunity to not only gain knowledge in engineering skills but also discover how engineers see the world, problem solve and explore the social, political and ethical influence of the field. The course is led by an experienced faculty member and two upper-division engineering students and with RE3 implemented, it focuses primarily on student empowerment. The program also offers Academy coaches to mentor students and share with them the resources that Viterbi offers. 
In 2019, the Coalition for Life-Transformative Education, a community of university leaders from across the country committed to transforming the education experience for undergraduate students, invited Viterbi to submit a proposal for a project to design and test ways to develop students’ experiences “through agency and providing students with a sense of purpose.” Director of the Engineering Writing Program Steve Bucher and lecturer at the Engineering Writing Program Helen Choi created RE3 with the support of the Dean’s office and were welcomed to launch the program in Spring 2020.
According to Bucher, “reverse-engineering engineering” is a play on words of one of the National Academy of Engineering grand challenges that they have set for this generation: reverse-engineering of the brain. This challenge aims to utilize students in helping professors improve in their teaching techniques.
“It’s that notion of reverse-engineering that we thought would be interesting as a name, but also as an approach to, kind of reverse-engineer engineering education,” Bucher said. “So rather than looking at this as we as faculty impart knowledge to students, why shouldn’t we reverse that and why shouldn’t we learn from the students how better to engage with them?”
Choi said that one of the main goals of the program is also to utilize experienced students to help develop a sense of understanding and community among freshmen in the school. The student trainers selected are hired for one academic year, presenting once or twice each semester. 
“What we first did was find upper-class students, juniors and seniors, who have gone through the Freshman Academy program and … hired them, they’re paid through stipends, to get trained in storytelling and how to craft their own stories in a compelling way and share them with others,” Choi said. 
As the program director, Choi said she felt that it was more important than ever for this incoming class to get support and develop feelings of purpose, identity, agency and community given that their first semester of college is online. 
“We hit that freshman class with this program for them to understand this is a course, it is a part of their curriculum and talking about [themselves] is so important that it is a part of the course,” Choi said. “You know my story is, even if its taking part in a small story activity, my participation is critical to making this part of the curriculum effective and complete and just respecting students and being able to say, ‘I know that what you bring to the classroom is more than what I know, and you can enrich my teaching’ is a really important message that I hope students get from the program.”
Jones, the principal investigator for RE3, said the program creators did not foresee the effects of a pandemic and concurrent Black Lives Matter protests when it was proposed in 2019. However, the impact of these events has created an outlet for many students to speak about their identities in ways they haven’t before. 
“Oftentimes students place their identity as an engineer in one place and then all of the rest of who they are in a different place,” Jones said. “You have them being an engineer or scholar that sits here, and them being whatever their race, gender, gender identity, gender expression, religion, ability status, political party, all of the dimensions of their identity, they sit over here. We don’t have enough opportunities to bring those two together so that a student can truly bring their whole selves to the classroom.”
Michelle Ran, a junior majoring in computer science, is a student trainer at RE3. She did her first presentation on Aug. 25 for professor Anthony Maddox’s Freshman Academy group. Ran said she was nervous to present to the class because she describes herself as an introvert and has always had trouble with public speaking, but after seeing a positive response from students she believes that it went well.
“Not only did it help me when I was preparing the presentation, just having to figure out what I wanted to convey to the audience, it helped me think through a lot of things on my end,” Ran said. “When I gave the presentation, people really engaged with it and they started getting into conversations beyond just what I was guiding them towards so that felt really rewarding.”
Ran said the program is beneficial for first-year students because many freshmen go into college without a clear idea of what success can look like. She said RE3 teaches freshmen that they are not alone in their struggles and that upperclassmen have been where they are — something that she wishes existed when she was a freshman herself. 
“The freshman students I think I mainly wanted to share the lessons that I learned as a student, which was to make time for things that are valuable to you,” Ran said. “My point was to think about what is most meaningful to you in life and not just what other people like your parents or your teachers tell you is important like grades. What you find valuable might not be that and so if you identify what that is and try to make time for that it makes your life a lot more fulfilling.”
Bucher said that after hearing one of the student trainer’s stories in the early weeks of the semester, he was already able to see the importance of the RE3 program and understanding students holistically.
“The goal was to have the students share their stories in a way that helps us understand them better and it didn’t really hit me as a faculty member until I was able to hear Cheyenne [Gaima] in this case, gave her story,” Bucher said. “It was very moving in that it was an articulation of who she is in a way that I hadn’t heard before and that faculty usually don’t have an opportunity to hear. It’s always a good reminder that our students are complex people that have sides that maybe we don’t think about when we are designing curriculum and when we’re figuring out the best ways to engage them as learners.”
