As on-campus move-in takes place during the week before classes start in the fall, the first leader that first-year students encounter at USC is often their resident assistant.
RAs at USC have two primary mandates. The first is their responsibility of serving as the primary rule-enforcer in their residential areas. According to the Residential Education at USC website, they’re dutied to “enforce university policies, confront student behavior, and document student actions and/or situations when necessary.”
Their second and perhaps more influential job is to create a positive atmosphere in their residence halls and make themselves available as a vital part of their residents’ support systems. RAs “establish rapport with residents … through attentive listening, genuine care and support, awareness of student needs, and appropriate consultation and referral,” according to the Residential Education website.
Effectively executing these important jobs would itself qualify as a difficult, time-intensive proposition. However, RAs are also tasked with a variety of time-intensive administrative responsibilities assigned by Residential Education. One of these requirements is to compile detailed weekly reports on the lives of their residents, often requiring information about students’ academics, social life and extracurricular activities. Additionally, RAs must decorate the walls of their residential area with informative graphics and, at least in some residence halls, update the decorations several times each semester. 
Needless to say, RAs’ obligations are often overwhelming. Exacerbating the stress RAs’ often all-consuming duties incur are job insecurity and inadequate compensation. RAs are compensated in the form of free housing and a complimentary meal plan for the duration of USC’s academic year. While these are helpful perks considering exorbitant housing prices and the $3,150 cost of an unlimited meal plan, they are outweighed by the stresses of long unpaid hours and job insecurity (and thus, housing insecurity). 
If caught violating University rules, RAs can be fired and thereby ejected from their housing. Given the prevalence of minor rule violations on college campuses, many RAs live under the threat of losing their housing for engaging in standard social behavior.
For example, an analysis by the National Institute of Health concluded that 53.8% of full-time college students drink alcohol monthly and 34.6% binge drink. Because USC is a dry campus, engaging in these activities in USC Housing facilities is a rule violation. For regular students, consequences for drinking in their residence hall would be a standard write-up leading to no punitive action beyond a formal reprimand; however, if RAs are caught in such a violation, their job and housing are in jeopardy. Despite their status as leaders within their housing community, RAs are students too, who want a college experience that aligns with their peers’.
For the sake of RAs’ mental health and effectiveness as resources for their residents, USC Residential Education must give them more support. This support could come in the form of a stipend for their work, fewer hours, less onerous weekly requirements or the articulation of a more lenient policy for rule violations.
Instead of treating RAs as upright disciplinarians who must transcend the follies of standard college student behavior in order to properly do their job, USC ResEd should recognize that they are complex individuals capable of maintaining the University’s disciplinary standards without their employer levelling threats based on their personal behavior and constantly monitoring the fulfillment of their professional duties.
RAs’ position as students trained to serve as valuable resources for their residential communities and ease first-year students’ transition to college renders them indispensable to the effective functioning of USC on-campus housing. Supporting them will not only enhance their own college experience and mental health but also serve as an investment in the broader USC community.

“Saturday Night Live” made headlines last month after removing one of its newly hired cast members Shane Gillis for homophobic slurs and racist remarks toward Chinese people. While this news is important and should be a catalyst to discuss discrimination of marginalized groups, it’s important to also raise awareness about Bowen Yang, the first Asian American member to join the cast after 44 seasons of no such representation.
It may not come as a surprise, but Asians have been largely underrepresented in the media and not just on “SNL.” According to a 2019 report published by the Radio Television Digital News Association and Hofstra University, Asian Americans make up only 2% of people in newsrooms, and that number drops to 1% for TV News Directors. In addition to this, only 4.8% of the characters in the top 100 films in 2017 were Asian American — that means that 37 of the movies did not have a single Asian speaking character, according to a report from the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.
“SNL” has specifically had a scarce number of Asian roles — there have been only a total of six Asian hosts. Additionally, there have been times where writers, like Akira Yoshimura, played the roles of Connie Chung and Sulu from “Star Trek” skits due to limited staff options. And Yang, who joined “SNL” as a writer last season, wrote multiple sketches, such as “The Actress” starring Emma Stone, and even portrayed Kim Jong-un in “Kremlin Meeting” alongside Sandra Oh. 
Just based on experience, it’s a no-brainer that “SNL” promoted Yang from a writer to a series regular. However, what’s more important to highlight is that Yang’s inclusion  will give Asian Americans a voice. In comedy, it’s crucial to have someone telling jokes and stories that the audience can relate to. Everyone can joke about common issues that happen in everyday life that may yield a funny response. However, by supplementing the “SNL” cast with an Asian American cast member, the show can now tap into identity topics within that community. In essence, “SNL” has access to a wider range of sketch possibilities that can reach a broader audience.
Look at 2018’s “Crazy Rich Asians,” starring an all Asian American cast. While the movie followed a typical romantic comedy plot and didn’t address any deep messages, its ground-breaking feat came from the fact that Asian Americans were given the spotlight as lead characters. “SNL” must take a lesson from this and realize that groups cannot be reduced to overshadowed sidekicks or extras that are deemed irrelevant. As I watched Asians on-screen, both this movie and 1993’s “The Joy Luck Club” gave me an immense sense of pride to see people that resembled me play important roles. I didn’t reflect on it much at the time, but I was able to come to a stark realization in the days after Yang was added to “SNL:” the movie advanced the role of Asian Americans by portraying them as something more than just a marginalized group or an archaic trope.
With Yang on “SNL,” the show must take steps to ensure the Asian American voice isn’t drowned out. The show has already taken action to prevent this: After reprising the role of Kim Jong-un in “Impeachment Cold Open,” Yang played democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang in the sketch “DNC Town Hall.” And even though his appearance was a brief, short-lived 10 seconds, “SNL” appropriately used his skills to joke about Andrew Yang and his standings in the polls. 
It’s commendable that “SNL” took the first step to promote diverse perspectives in its show by hiring its first Asian American cast member, despite how easy it is to criticize how the show failed to properly include them for over 40 years. 
Viewers should applaud “SNL” for staggering away from discrimination and  moving toward a potential future where Asian Americans can view sketches that they can feel a strong connection to.

With the Sept. 20 climate strike drawing more than 200 students to Tommy Trojan to join the global movement for climate change awareness, it is clear that environmental security is at the forefront of USC students’ minds.
It is also on the mind of President Carol Folt, whose zero-waste inauguration took place that same day. Just a few days prior, Folt announced that USC would be reviving its transit subsidy program after its discontinuation back in 2015. The program will give USC staff and faculty a 50% subsidy on transit passes.
These subsidies are a step in the right direction toward the campus-wide sustainability goal presented by the University’s Sustainability 2028 Plan. By incentivizing employees to use public transit, USC encourages them to become more informed about the environmental impacts of commuting by single-passenger vehicles.
Indeed, the last time that the University had an active subsidy program, it seemed to be a popular option for commuting staff and employees. According to the Los Angeles Times, in 2015, more than 3,000 USC employees used the discounted transit passes before they were discontinued that July. At the time, USC was offering Los Angeles Metro E-passes at a $30 discount from their standard price of $100. Now, Metro E-passes run for $40, and the greater financial incentive will likely bring an increase in public transit use.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 4.71 metric tons of carbon dioxide are produced by one vehicle per year. Therefore, if the number of employees returning to the program equals or exceeds the previous count, the reduction in annual carbon dioxide emissions could number over 14,000 metric tons.
The program has the potential to be successful because of the way that it establishes a daily routine of environmental consciousness. If employees commute to USC using the Metro rail or bus every day, not only will carbon emissions be reduced regularly, climate change awareness may become an ingrained part of people’s lifestyles, which is important if widespread awareness is the goal.
At a time when there is an immediate and critical need for a change in sustainability practices, USC has responded with appropriate measures. Alongside E-passes, USC Transportation also has U-passes available for purchase by graduate students. This means that another sizeable population of the campus has access to public transit at discounted prices.
LA Metro offers TAP cards at a reduced price for students (a 30-Day Pass is $43 instead of the standard $100). However, USC does not offer an additional discount or subsidy for undergraduate students like the one for employees and graduate students. Students who commute to USC could benefit from subsidized transit passes as much as employees. Though many undergraduate students who live off-campus live within walking distance, for those who do not and for times when students want to get around the greater L.A. area, taking the Metro at a discounted price is more affordable and sustainable than other forms of transportation. And as students become the face of the climate change awareness movement, it only makes sense to include them in the transit subsidy.
Along with saving money for commuters and reducing the carbon footprint of the school, the transit subsidy program will ultimately make a statement about USC’s values. With the government turning a blind eye to the compromised environment and a deaf ear to the proponents of climate change awareness, it is more important than ever for USC to stand behind its students in combating climate change. 
By promoting student-organized events such as the climate strike and opting to subsidize transit passes, USC is sending the message that it takes both the voices of its students and the state of the environment seriously.

“I asked if I should wait to enter until I’m fully grown?” Banks recited a poem at her  Los Angeles tour stop, giving context to the maturity woven throughout her third studio album, “III.” Her stage presence was sophisticated, and her choreography was complicated; it’s clear that Banks is not the 24-year-old who released debut EP “Fall Over” but a full-grown star who is here to stay. 
Bank’s sold-out performance at The Hollywood Palladium was more than a concert; it was a light show, poetry slam and homecoming all in one. Amid billowing smoke, she opened the show with “Till Now.” As the sold-out room cheered for the alt-R&B singer’s entrance, she and her dancers emulated a Cirque du Soleil-esque performance. 
Dancers Allison Fletcher and Nadine Olmo cast eerie but ethereal shadows behind the singer as they moved in robotic unison during her set. The duo added depth and sex appeal to her set, complementing the amourous track “Stroke.” While performing the track she flirts with the dancers and seemingly makes out with them, much to the crowd’s approval. 
Dressed in all black with leather thigh-high boots and reveling in the cheers from her hometown of Los Angeles, Banks shifted the high energy show with a poem titled “Ode to the Gray Zone.” 
She originally posted to her Instagram in late September, and described it as an alternative name for her album but decided against it because “that’s kind of fucking pretentious,’” she said. The poem features a high-level of introspection, themes definitely not foreign for the former USC psychology major. 
Next, the singer swapped her dancers for a string quartet during the live rendition of “Contaminated.” The choice was not only a treat for her L.A. fans, but one signifying maturity in the artist; at this point, her show moved from any regular concert to a production with multiple acts. She’d given fans a peek into her homecoming, only to end it with a bang during the encore. 
With her first four songs, especially “Stroke,” she brought intense energy, perfect for opening the show. She slowed it down with her profoundly personal poem and added a serious, almost mellow tone to the set with the string quartet. And for her last two acts, she continued to shift the tone and please. 
The size of the Palladium allowed for fans to lose control during songs like “Alaska.” Her semi-soprano whispering and catchy chorus were met with swaying  hips and nodding heads. In a full house, not a single expression of movement by Banks or her fans was lost. At every angle and level, the full experience was provided and no area was too crowded to dance.
Her light show amplified during hyper-electric tracks like “The Fall” and “Gemini Feed.” Synth elements matched perfectly with the strobes of pink, red, blue and purple lights. Performers often struggle with balancing technical aspects with breathtaking vocals — Banks managed to incorporate both. 
Her “III” album and tour came after a two-year hiatus from music which ended with the single “Gimme,” released in July. During Tuesday night’s performance of the song, she recreated the video with laser light effects and choreography that seemed inspired by “Kill Bill: Volume 1.” 
Unbeknownst to fans, the track was just the beginning of the end. 
The singer began her final act of the night with “This Is What It Feels Like,” the favorite from her 2014 album “Goddess” that was previously removed from her setlist. The choice was made seemingly just for her Los Angeles show, and she then completed the homecoming with another throwback from her debut, “Beggin For Thread.” 
Banks’ show can’t be summed up in a single word. Her vocals are nontraditional but breathtaking. The attention to detail showcased in the technical elements not only complemented but heightened her artistry. With the “III” album and tour, she shows immense growth as a performer and an artist ⁠— she gave fans an experience that must be witnessed live.

Picture this: I’m standing in line to get into Supreme’s New York flagship. In front of me are three Chinese international kids sporting Yeezys, Anti Social Social Club hoodies and fuckboi fades. Behind me is a 12-year-old, three inches shorter than me, draped in head-to-toe Bape topped off with a Supreme shoulder sling fanny pack. 
Record scratch. Freeze frame. “Yep, that’s me. You’re probably wondering how I ended up here.”
In 1994, Supreme founder James Jebbia took over an old office space on Lafayette Street. and began churning out T-shirts, hoodies and backpacks. At first, it was just a store for skateboarders that blasted music and played Muhammad Ali fight videos to lure in customers. Twenty-five years later, Supreme is a global giant, and customers fight over its drops using automated checkout bots. Streetwear is now ubiquitous, having infiltrated the fashion world and worming its way into popular culture. 
Just how dominant is streetwear? In an era of faltering retail, sneakerhead favorites Adidas and Nike show no signs of slowing down. Luxury brands that produce coveted streetwear staples, such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton, are among the fastest growing brands in the luxury sector. Status symbols, once represented by Chanel tweed jackets and high-heeled Louboutins, are being replaced by Supreme hoodies and chunky Balenciaga Triple-S sneakers.
It’s impossible for me to cover the breadth and depth of streetwear in a single column, and that’s not my intention. What I’m doing is setting up the context for why I — someone who has no idea how to skateboard — found myself sandwiched in between hypebeasts. 
I’d heard about Supreme (I mean, who hasn’t?), but I’d dismissed it as out of my purview. I assumed that the average Supreme fan was white, male and rich, all of which I certainly am not. Also, I don’t skate. Multiple people have tried to teach me, and it always ended with me gripping onto their arm, whimpering, “I want to get off! I want to get off!” 
But O.K., I’ll admit it. I’m unduly susceptible to hype. I eat at restaurants that Bon Appetit has gushed over (Konbi); I watch the TV shows that everyone talks about on my Twitter timeline (“Fleabag,” “Succession”). I can’t help it — I have intense, deep-seated FOMO, and I want to see what all the fuss is about. 
It started with just browsing through “r/streetwear” on Reddit, seeing what kind of fits people posted. Then it graduated to watching streetwear YouTubers like Christian Villanueva of Frugal Aesthetic and Blake Linder of Bsneak. I bookmarked websites like Complex, Highsnobiety and Hypebae, the female equivalent of Hypebeast. I didn’t buy tickets to ComplexCon, thankfully, but oh man, I was thinking about it. 
I bought a Richardson jacket that ended up being way too big around the shoulders. I bought an OBEY sweater and caught a kid whose voice hadn’t yet cracked giving me the once-over. I bought a pair of Nikes from Naked, a female-focused sneaker supplier, and ended up paying half the total amount in shipping costs because it’s based in Copenhagen. 
For a time, I thought I was happy with all of this. I was certainly happy when my packages arrived. But after a while, when I went to get dressed in the morning, I found myself skipping over the streetwear and reaching for pieces like a rainbow-hued sweater or red and white striped overalls. 
Here’s the thing: Streetwear is cool, sure. But it’s low-key. It’s chill. It sticks to a pretty drab color palette: white, black, gray, blue (excluding that god-awful Bape purple camo). It likes to play it safe with boring basics — it doesn’t try too hard. 
As a result, the people who wear it don’t have to try too hard. It’s all a rotation of hoodies and jeans and T-shirts and sneakers. Outfits are thrown together for the clout, regardless of whether or not the pieces go together, if the proportions match and if the look is balanced and cohesive. You’re not stunting if the cuffs of your Off-White sweatpants are dragging on the ground. Honestly? Most hypebeasts don’t know how to dress. Yeah, I said it. 
When did I finally come to my senses? Good question; I’m not too sure myself. Maybe it was when I had my “What the fuck am I doing here?” moment in the Supreme line. Maybe it was when I realized I had three identical black hoodies hanging in my closet and I wasn’t excited to wear any of them. Or maybe it was when I was scrolling through the comments of a Bsneak video at 2 a.m. which were all about “Un-DS”ing the girl in the video. (DS stands for Deadstock, which is brand new, unopened, untouched …You get the idea.)
I don’t regret my brief dalliance with streetwear — when figuring out your style, it’s just as important to know what you don’t like as what you do. It showed me that covering yourself in logos from head-to-toe is no substitute for personal style and that hype can so easily cloud your judgment. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go get a fit-off.

How should USC handle a student group that other student groups say promotes hate speech? Nearly 30 students silently walked out of an event last Thursday featuring Michael Knowles, a far-right commentator and author. The talk was hosted by conservative student group Young Americans for Freedom. Protestors called on USC to revoke YAF’s status as a student organization. Music by Joakin Karud.

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders canceled a campaign event at USC after undergoing heart surgery Tuesday night, the Center for the Political Future and Political Student Assembly announced Wednesday. 
“We wish Sen. Sanders all the best and a speedy recovery, and look forward to welcoming him to campus at a later date,” the statement read. “The event, until further notice, is canceled.” 
The organizations planned to host Sanders for a town hall-style event Friday at the Tutor Campus Center Ballroom.
Sanders canceled his events indefinitely after experiencing chest pain during a campaign event Tuesday, the Vermont senator’s senior campaign adviser wrote in a statement Wednesday. Sanders experienced blockage in one artery and issues with two stents.  
“Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits,” the Sanders statement read. “He will be resting up over the next few days.”
On Tuesday evening, Sanders visited a memorial for victims of the 2017 Las Vegas massacre. Sanders had at least 10 campaign events scheduled in California between Wednesday and Friday, according to his campaign website. 
Elex Michaelson, an anchor at FOX LA, which was set to air the town hall, tweeted Wednesday that the event would be postponed until further notice. 
“Sending healing vibes to [Sen. Sanders] as he recovers from heart surgery,” Michaelson wrote. “We hope to reschedule with him and have information about alternative programming soon.” 
Trojans for Warren, a student organization supporting Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, also tweeted its support for Sanders.
“Wishing Sen. Sanders a speedy recovery and a return to the campaign trail,” the account tweeted. “We need you in this fight, Bernie!”
