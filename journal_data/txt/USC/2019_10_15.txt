Undergraduate Student Government updated a statement released Sept. 10 reaffirming its commitment to campus mental health to include specific ongoing senate initiatives during a Senate meeting Tuesday. 
Sen. Angela Chuang said the statement’s updates help promote concrete initiatives USG is working on to improve mental health issues on campus. 
“We really want to ensure that students recognize that we’re here to support them, and we’re here to work on projects that will benefit them and will hopefully support them regarding mental health,” Chuang said. 
Eight projects sponsored by USG senators were included in the updated statement. One initiative, spearheaded by Chuang, aims to increase transparency in the dispute process for the $20 missed mental health counseling appointment fee. While there has been a dispute process in place, Chuang said many students are unaware of its existence.
Chuang met with Dr. Sarah Van Orman, chief health officer and associate vice provost for student affairs, and Dr. Robert Mendola, executive director and division chief of student mental health, to discuss the issue. Since then, the official billing dispute form has been added to the USC Student Health website and a line concerning the dispute process has been included at the end of the letter sent when charges are sent to the student account.
Senators Emily Johnson, Chris McMorran and Benjamin Shiff are in the process of approving a task force of eight students to collaborate with Engemann Student Health Center on redesigning the mental health resources page on its website.
“We felt that [the website] wasn’t as intuitive as it could be … it seems very text-heavy,” Johnson said. “It wasn’t as approachable as it could be.” 
The task force intends to incorporate student perspectives on website changes and informational clarity. The senators are currently revising their initial proposal for the taskforce and expect it to be approved in the next few weeks.
Aside from the revised statement, USG unanimously passed a resolution to continue its involvement in the Student Leadership Association of California during Tuesday’s meeting. The resolution follows USG’s participation in a SLAC conference Oct. 6, where student government representatives from 15 universities met at UCLA to discuss issues of administrative transparency and student engagement. 
USC, Pitzer and Occidental initially created SLAC in 2018 to build connections between student leaders across California. The resolution will formalize its support for the association of student governments.

The sounds of different mariachi ensembles playing over one another to win over plaza crowds in Los Angeles and in Guadalajara inspired Thornton School of Music student Juan-Pablo Contreras to compose the title track of his debut orchestral album “Mariachitlán.” Now, he’s up for a Latin GRAMMY.
The doctoral candidate studying music composition said he created “Mariachitlán,” which translates to “The Land of Mariachi,” to express the beauty of Mexico and to pay homage to his home state of Jalisco, the origin state of mariachi. 
“This genre came about during the Spanish conquest,” Contreras said. “Some people said that the word mariachi comes from the French word of marriage, mariage, between the indigenous tradition and the new European music.” 
Contreras originally wrote “Mariachitlán” for the 2016 Jalisco Orchestral Composition competition. After taking home the prize, Contreras said the Jalisco Philharmonic Orchestra gave him the opportunity to record a full album with them, under the condition that he would obtain funding. 
Contreras said USC supported his work and gave him the green light to fund the album. He received the 2017 Presser Graduate Award, which offers up to a $10,000 stipend to graduate students who show high potential and honorable contributions in the music field. 
“USC was basically the first supporting organization that allowed me to record this album,” Contreras said. “It’s amazing to now have a Latin GRAMMY nomination with something I think started with great thanks to USC.” 
Once the album’s recording was finished, Contreras became the first Mexican classical composer to sign a record deal with Universal Music in May 2019. 
The album also features other works, including “El Laberinto de la Soledad” and the three-part “Pirámide del Sol.” He said the first piece, which translates to “The Labyrinth of Solitude,” was inspired by a book with the same title that examines what it means to be Mexican. The work illustrates what Mexico “sounds” like to Contreras. The latter, which means “The Pyramid of the Sun,” pays tribute to the ball games of the pre-Hispanic civilization Teotihuacan. 
“What’s interesting about the album is that these three works explain with music, or depict the history of Mexico,” Contreras said. “The third one is about pre-Hispanic Mexico, the second one is about the Spanish conquest and how that shaped the country and then ‘Mariachitlán’ pays homage to modern Mexico.” 
Contreras thanked the Latino Alumni Association for playing a huge role during his time at the University. He said the association provided a community that made him feel at home, supported him during the album making process and offered him a scholarship to attend USC.
“He just got nominated for a Latin GRAMMY, he is headed to greatness,” said Dolores Sotelo, associate director of the LAA. “We are proud of having him not only as a scholar but just representing the Latino community as a whole.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Thornton Dean Robert Cutietta said the school is excited to follow Contreras’ nomination. 
“We are so proud of Juan and his Latin GRAMMY nomination!” Cutietta wrote. “Not many schools in the world would be able to celebrate a GRAMMY nomination by a student; most will never celebrate a nomination by a faculty member! So, we are excited for him and will all be following his nomination as it proceeds!”
Prior to attending USC to study composition, Contreras said his passion for music started in his childhood, thanks to his mother, who was a concert pianist. While his music tastes have changed over the years, classical compositions are his preferred genre.
“You could write whatever you wanted with all the freedoms of the world,” he said.
Contreras hopes to expand his music career and become an acclaimed composer. 
“My dream would be to be known as one of the most recognized Mexican classical music composers around the world, that my name could be synonymous with Mexican classical music,” he said.

Community members raised concerns about reporting methods and questioned USC administrators about the issue of sexual misconduct at a Town Hall held Tuesday afternoon to accompany the release of national and campus-wide survey results. Nearly 200 students, faculty and staff attended the town hall, to discuss the new data, which showed a rise in women experiencing sexual assaults on campus.
The 2019 Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct, published by the Association of American Universities, showed a slight increase in the prevalence of sexual assault on campus compared to USC data from AAU’s first survey, collected in 2015.
Following a presentation of the data, community members asked questions to a panel comprising members of the USC AAU Task Force, which is charged with making recommendations to the administration. 
USC has a history of “administrative failure” in responding to instances of sexual misconduct at USC, said Concerned Faculty of USC Chair Ariela Gross, citing an inconclusive 2016 investigation into former campus gynecologist George Tyndall made public earlier this year. 
She specifically referred to one task force member on the panel, Title IX coordinator Gretchen Means, who was quoted by the Los Angeles Times in reference to the investigation saying, ‘There was no there there,’ and that the University concluded Tyndall had not violated USC’s policies on sexual misconduct. 
“[That] is, I think, to me, the number one example of our administrative failure,” Gross said, referring to Means. 
Vice President of Student Affairs Winston Crisp responded to Gross, saying the University has “a lot to make up for.” 
“We have to … see this as a problem whose dimensions span the entire University,” Crisp said. “That doesn’t happen overnight.” 
The large number of attendees showed how concerned the campus community is about the issue, said Gross, a law and history professor. The University is currently battling hundreds of lawsuits related to allegations of sexual misconduct in the Engemann Student Health Center. 
Tyndall, who has been accused of sexual abuse by more than 800 women, pleaded not guilty in July after he was arrested on 29 felony counts. His case surfaced after the L.A. Times published an investigative piece in May 2018. 
In the 2019 survey, USC reported that 31% of its undergraduate women had experienced an instance of sexual assault, more than 5% higher than the national average of 25.9%. USC was one of 33 universities to participate in the survey. 
“No, we’re not happy,” Crisp said. “We will never be happy until these numbers get to where they are eradicated.”
Markie Anderle, the director of external affairs for Graduate Student Government and a master’s student in planning, asked about the University’s efforts to make campus support resources more accessible. The 2019 survey reported that 84% of undergraduate students who experienced sexual harassment did not report the incident, which Anderle called “completely unacceptable.” 
“The Title IX office page is also not what comes up when you Google ‘Title IX at USC,’” Anderle said. “And the [Office for Equity and Diversity]’s website looks like it was made in the ‘90s.” 
“I totally agree with you,” Means responded, laughing. “We are actually in the process of redoing the OED website.” 
Some attendees also expressed discontent with the lack of medical resources, such as 24-hour counseling services and access to post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, which can be taken to prevent possible HIV infection. 
Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman clarified that the student health center does carry PEP and that the University is in the process of hiring five full- and part-time “victim advocates.” Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services Director Brenda Ingram added that her office has also expanded to include more counselors. 
Katie Thanos, a senior majoring in law, history and culture who helped lead a protest last February in response to allegations of sexual abuse against former men’s health doctor Dennis Kelly, spoke about her own difficulties finding support after surviving a sexual assault incident last year. 
“We can’t be left floundering,” Thanos said, holding back tears. “Our process is so deeply flawed that even when you seek help it’s not given to you.”

W alking into With Love Market and Cafe is a unique experience. It combines an industrial atmosphere with a feeling of comfort. The floor mat greets customers with the word “welcome” scattered in various languages. To one side of the large, restored warehouse is a wooden stage used for open-mic nights and the Kid’s Cafe, a corner stocked with children’s toys. The cafe has balcony seating and is home to a little library. 
“Community is built by the quality of what we share in common,” reads the library sign. 
With Love, a grocery store and eatery, sits on Vermont Avenue and W. 20th St. and was founded by Andrew McDowell in March 2016. Before starting With Love, McDowell worked in digital marketing. He now manages the restaurant and serves as the executive director of With Love’s community programs, including children’s cooking classes.
“With Love started as a desire to address needs that were not met in our community,” McDowell said. “We wanted to figure out if we could do so in a sustainable way to where business could potentially help to start meeting some of these needs.” 
In particular, McDowell, a South L.A. resident, wanted to focus on health and employment in the community and on connecting individuals with one another. 
McDowell identified a few primary problems in his direct community, including an increase in the number of people with diabetes and hypertension, long work commutes and a lack of community involvement in its own well-being. Seeing these challenges compelled McDowell to take action. 
 To fight for the health of individuals, he ensured that With Love had a commitment to a healthy menu and natural grocery items. To increase job opportunities for locals, he put in place a company-wide policy to hire at least 75% of employees from within the immediate community. And, to encourage community interaction and internal support, he developed With Love community programs, free classes in partnership with community groups designed to educate South L.A. residents on topics like health education, community advocacy and financial literacy. 
“We find local community members or community groups that will offer classes or access to resources that other community members might not know about,” McDowell said. “We’re trying to make existing resources more accessible or bring in new resources to our community that would not have otherwise come and do it in a safe community space.”
These programs  bring the community together in one space, McDowell said. One particular relationship that he likes to foster is between local students — both college and high school — and retired folks. 
“They could meet together and take a yoga class together and maybe you wouldn’t have seen some of these people taking a yoga class in [USC]  Village, but you’ll see them take a yoga class here in this community space,” McDowell said. “The classes are free, taught bilingually and accessible to everybody. [There is] chance for that overlap, and that interaction that may have not been possible in other places.”
 With Love also makes efforts to engage the community in other ways. Through the back doors of the restaurant sits a community garden that several local groups help run. McDowell also rents the indoor space out for events and has created a strong relationship with the surrounding community. That relationship has led to donations from community members like the stage and outdoor murals. 
For McDowell, getting the community involved in his business was important. A new initiative provides community members with the chance to invest directly in the business and help further a space that is close to their hearts. 
“Our community is made up of all different types of people — lots of times people that are a little bit different from you,” McDowell said. “When you engage those people, not everything makes sense, but eventually, you start to see the value and the beauty of those people and our community. We try and reflect that in our business here so you’ll get a cultural, community experience — one that you wouldn’t have expected — each time you come in here.” 
Along with being a center for community engagement, McDowell wants to provide locals with good food. With Love sells a few special grocery items that South L.A. residents might not be able to find elsewhere. This selection has unfortunately dwindled since USC Village came around came around and Trader Joe’s started selling similar items such as organic milk. 
With his dishes, McDowell wants to ensure that the food is healthy and affordable, despite the natural, high-quality ingredients that the restaurant uses. 
“When we create a tuna fish sandwich, [we ask ourselves:] Do we use all of the mayonnaise that most restaurants will use, the high-fat ingredients, or do we find other ways to make something that uses a lot less of those ingredients and start using really natural products or things that are lower in fat?” McDowell said.
The study spaces on both floors of the building are frequently used by students from one of the five primary schools a few blocks away. McDowell noticed that these children and teens would walk in with chips and a soda because they wouldn’t have enough money to buy healthier options. With the wellness of the community mind, he created menu items that were more financially accessible for them without compromising With Love’s commitment to natural ingredients. He also initiated an after-school discount on the smoothies where students in K-12 get 25% off.
College students and local families also frequent the space. Popular menu items include carnitas, paninis and the vegan vegetable curry.
“We started this whole social enterprise with next to no experience and an attempt to create dishes that we felt people in our community would love,” McDowell said. “Now that we’ve been open almost four years, we have continued to develop our menu, our drinks and our food to really be culturally relevant, to have flavor profiles that are of our community and that meet the health needs and desires of folks from our community.”
Two hallmarks of this community flavor are Tio’s Barbacoa and the Horchata Latte. Tio’s Barbacoa comes with a heap of beef over brown rice, with guacamole, pico de gallo and a mix of black and pinto beans on the side. As a strong contrast to the savory profile of the barbacoa, the horchata latte starts with a bitterness that slowly dissolves into a cinnamon taste. 
All of this involvement and culinary excellence come together to create a hyper-local impact and a homey, inviting space. In fact, McDowell says the name itself — With Love Market and Cafe — expresses this company perfectly.
“We knew what we wanted to create in With Love after a few years but we didn’t know what to call it,” McDowell said. “I looked back on some notes that I had taken at the very beginning of the envisioning process, and I remember writing down something that my grandmother used to say. She used to say that she made the food for us with love. I felt like that was the sentiment that we wanted to embody: We wanted to create something with love for our community.”

We are living in an incredible time for fashion. A renaissance, if you will. Right now, you could probably get famous on TikTok for an exceptional fifteen seconds of content and within months be handpicked by the Virgil Abloh himself to sit at a Louis Vuitton show. 
But that’s merely the discourse surrounding the fashion world. When it comes to the clothes themselves, fashion is smarter, more accessible and more inclusive than ever. Just a few weeks ago, Rihanna had massive success with the show for her Savage X Fenty lingerie line, which featured dazzling choreography and sexy new silhouettes made for every type of woman. 
However, there is no better example of clothing made for the diverse humans of 2019 than what was displayed at L.A. Fashion Week.
You might be scratching your head right now, oblivious to its existence, but LAFW is extremely hot. Despite not having the prestige of the big four (New York, London, Milan and Paris), Los Angeles is one of the largest cultural centers for fashion in the world. Many designers and modeling agencies are based in L.A., and as influencers from all backgrounds flock to the City of Angels, designers are taking notes. 
Originally called “Press Week,” LAFW has been around since 1953, but the term L.A. Fashion Week wasn’t used until 2002. Held biannually, LAFW just wrapped up its Fall 2020 run at the Peterson Automotive Museum. 
The first designer to hit the runway was Noe Bernacelli, a Peruvian creative director whose collection, “El Cuervo y la Serpiente,” showcased formalwear with intricate beading and needlework. I could probably stare at his dresses for hours. Coral Castillo’s line of black, white and navy blue gowns featuring bodices adorned with geometric patterns was also to die for.
However, what stood out to me the most at LAFW was the exploration of traditional feminine silhouettes in a modern context. Luooifstudio’s 2020 collection gave audiences a taste of both couture and ready to wear, showing that the Instagram aesthetics of matching sets and sock heels can be high fashion if done in an interesting way. The mint, chartreuse and lilac color scheme was understated, yet effective in complementing the bolder design elements. My eyes were also drawn to Tako Mekvabidze’s take on what it means to be a “cool girl.” Mekvabidze, a Georgian designer, brings the edginess of her hometown to LA through leather trench coats and tiny sunglasses.
Additionally, the low-keyness of LAFW allowed for more diversity in the models. Although it’s disappointing that the big four is incredibly slow to adopt these practices, I’m a big believer that diversity on the runway should be normalized everywhere and that the media should make more of an effort to cover the shows that do. Smock Me’s colorful urban collection showcased just that, proving their clothes are for everyone, regardless of height, race or size. The collection seemed to be a fan favorite; it received the most positive comments out of all the posts on LAFW’s Instagram. 
LAFW isn’t the most cutting-edge event happening in the fashion world right now, but it’s still incredibly important. Designers from all over the world have come to showcase their work, proving that Los Angeles is still a pioneer of style. LAFW is adapting to changing tastes influenced by the digital age, perhaps faster than most of its contemporaries, just by being at the center of it. 
Overall, LAFW is definitely hot. If you haven’t seen the looks, check them out on Instagram @LAFW.

“Gemini Man” has been a long time coming. The original concept, a tale of an aging assassin having to fight his younger self, was sold to Disney in 1997 with the intention of having it out by 1998. Obviously, that didn’t happen. Instead, the film was trapped in development hell for decades. It was rewritten multiple times and featured a revolving door of actors and directors including Harrison Ford, Nicolas Cage, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. However, none of them stuck, primarily because the technology to de-age them simply did not exist.
But in early 2017, after toiling in purgatory for so long, Ang Lee came onto the project. 
Ever since “Life of Pi,” his critical darling and Oscar smash, Lee has been using the blank check Hollywood wrote him to push cinema to places it’s never been. He started doing that in 2016 with “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk,” and has now continued it with “Gemini Man,” shooting some scenes in the former in 3D 4K 120 frames per second, and shooting the latter entirely in this new format. To put those numbers in perspective: A standard film that you’ll see in the theater is in 24 fps. Some sports programs aon television are shown in 60 fps, but 120 is unheard of. To make it happen, Lee essentially had to create new cameras and a new way of shooting.
But now, it’s here — “Gemini Man.”  Starring Will Smith as aging government assassin Henry Brogan, it details his encounters with a younger version of himself, cloned through Project Gemini, and his unraveling of an entire government conspiracy to create the perfect soldier.
Right off the bat, if you see the film in 120 fps (which I highly recommend), the first thing you’ll notice is how strange it looks. There’s no blur from motion and each scene must be overlit to compensate for the high frame rate, so there’s a certain uncanny valley-ness the viewer must overcome before being immersed in the plot. But once the immersion is there, it’s an interesting experience — the filmmaking recognizes how much the increased frame rate makes it looks like a video game and leans into that, employing many first-person shots.
However, much of the dialogue in the film is atrocious — cheesy and awkward in a very off-putting way. Although the concept is intriguing, much of the dialogue is terrible and the plot is typically globetrotting spy stuff we’ve all seen before. Lee attempts to imbue it with as much thematic depth as he can — examining the relationship between the younger Harry, bred to kill, and the older one who understands the weight of those actions — but he can only do so much.
 Smith, however, is charismatic enough to pull most of it off. He plays both of his characters well; the plot is especially reflective as the dichotomy between the younger and older Smith is inherently reminiscent on Smith’s career in the context of his rise to stardom. The de-aging technology is convincing for the most part too and only in scenes in broad daylight become too strange. The surrounding performances, Benedict Wong as Baron the sidekick, and Mary Elizabeth Windstead as Danny Zakarweski, another government operative, are both great as well. Wong in particular brings a lot of needed comedic relief to his role.
Where “Gemini Man” really shines is its action, some of the cleanest in years. It’s reminiscent of something the Wachowskis would do — in one sequence, the younger Harry wields a dirt bike as a weapon against an enemy; in another, the Harrys fight each other in the catacombs underneath Paris. Lee, unlike many modern action directors, lets the camera move and follow characters instead of using fast cuts.
“Gemini Man” creates an incredible viewer experience for film lovers. However, to the average moviegoer, the film may be a bit too out there if they’re simply looking for some action. This new technology is not the future of cinema, as Lee believes it is, but it’s certainly a sight to behold.

This past spring, 66,000 hopeful applicants collectively held their breath as they logged on to their devices to find out whether or not they would be attending USC in the fall. Of these 66,000 applicants, about 1,300 are international students who were accepted. For them, celebration most likely lasted only a few minutes before reality seeped in. They had to start considering the implications of saying goodbye to friends and family and look deeper into their financial security. 
The University prides itself on the fact that international students make up about a quarter of the total undergraduate and graduate student body. However, this pride is hardly acted on. The University lacks economic assistance for international students. 
Even though Forbes ranks USC at No. 33 on its Top Schools for International Students list, the University is also ranked the eighth most expensive college in the nation by Business Insider. 
This is particularly significant because international students are not eligible for federal or USC need-based financial aid. 
Outside of the U.S., many universities extend their affordable rates to non-citizens: German colleges are mostly tuition-free for international students. With USC’s incredibly high tuition rates, the University should be able to give significant financial aid to international students.
International students are already at a disadvantage when applying. They are on different school systems that are most likely not well-suited to prepare them for admission requirements like the SAT and ACT. This already gives international students a lower likelihood of getting accepted into highly selective institutions and prompts many to seek test prep courses, private college counselors and other expensive student services. 
Additionally, data from the National Association for College Admission Counseling shows international students spend more money applying to more colleges in fear that they will not be accepted, partly because of how easy it is now to apply. Students, for instance, can use the Common Application, to apply to more than 800 schools. This can easily lead students to spend even more money on the application process.
Furthermore, international students may also put money toward flights back home to their home countries to visit their families. The average cost of living abroad is also significant, since in the U.S. living costs are generally higher than in most countries. China and India, the countries with the largest number of students on campus, are ranked 84th and 134th, respectively, on the 2019 Mid-Year Cost of Living Index, as opposed to the U.S., which is ranked 25th. 
International students are also not eligible for work-study positions on campus, so those who wish to lighten the financial load by working while pursuing their college degree cannot do so. In addition, immigration regulations only allow international students to work at an off-campus location provided their employer is educationally affiliated with their university, which only applies to Hebrew Union College and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, making it highly difficult for international students to get a job, especially if they are pursuing a degree outside of these two employment options. 
The biggest issue is that international students have little to no information at their disposal. Applicants looking to invest in an American education don’t have much data on which to base their decisions, and admissions experts may not be aware of any extensive databases that tackle topics like international student financial aid. 
Students at USC share a common academic goal, but not everyone is given the same path to success. International students already invest a lot of money on studying in the U.S.; many can only come if they get stellar grades and a scholarship. USC requires all student visa holders to be registered for a full course of study in classes that meet their degree requirements during fall and spring semesters. In general, international students keep these promises due to the high stakes that come with attending a foreign university. In fact, since 1995, 50% of USC Rhodes Scholars have been international students. 
International students should be given priority for merit scholarships, both due to the lack of financial assistance and due to their academic reliability. International students add diversity to a college or university, enriching the experience of other students on campus. USC is already a step ahead by having a significant international student population; now it is time to lighten some of the financial burdens on them.

Warning: This article contains several spoilers.
“What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash! I’ll tell you what you get, you get what you fucking deserve!” 
Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker delivers this line before pulling the trigger on talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) on live TV. The show’s feed cuts out and the camera pulls back to reveal the aftermath: an array of TV screens and telecasters speaking over each other. Their voices become noise. It’s the same sound as the media coverage of all the latest shootings, the sound of our collective attempt — and failure — to make sense of the chaos. 
“Joker” has been thrown into the center of a month-long controversy, even before its wide release on Oct. 4. Critics have accused it of glorifying the kind of violence committed by incels — a subculture of sexually frustrated, estranged and often violent men. The film’s online description seems a deliberate allusion to these individuals: “Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.” Some fear that the movie will serve as a beacon for male rage, or even inspire another shooting like the one that occurred at the 2012 screening of “The Dark Knight Rises.”  
The film follows Arthur Fleck, a clown-for-hire and aspiring stand-up comedian with a mental illness that causes uncontrollable laughter. He lives with his mother and idolizes Murray Franklin. His turn to violence begins one night on a subway, when he shoots three drunk businessmen who had harassed a woman sitting alone in the same car. 
From here, the movie does not condemn Fleck’s violence. His actions trigger an uprising among Gotham’s disgruntled lower class, and clown-masked protestors take their frustrations to the streets with signs reading “Eat The Rich.” The film culminates with Fleck murdering Franklin, but even until the end, the camera does not vilify his actions. The second to last scene shows Fleck over a crowd of fellow clowns, raising his arms to their howling approval. 
“Joker” is by no means the only movie that glorifies violence. Critics have compared it to Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver,” a movie that celebrates its protagonist for committing multiple grisly murders. Moreover, how many modern action films can be said to condemn the violence that their characters commit? 
There is something different about “Joker” that puts audiences and critics at unease with its treatment and portrayal of the protagonist. Perhaps it is the same thing that caused its rating to drop significantly from Europe to America, for it to win the Golden Lion in Venice, but attract widespread reproach among domestic critics. Perhaps the reason is that “Joker,” and the type of violence it depicts, hits too close to home for it to receive an objective review. 
Many have pointed out that the Joker as a character represents the form of chaos that each generation most fears. Jack Nicholson’s Joker in the 1989 “Batman” targets businesses and threatens to topple the entire economy, a reflection of the era’s recession and political turmoil. Heath Ledger’s post-9/11 Joker in “The Dark Knight” is a terrorist who causes Batman to create a surveillance state in Gotham. In 2019, our Joker is a mass killer. 
Like Fleck’s form of violence, the setting of Gotham feels strikingly familiar. Businessman Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) is running for mayor as a spokesman for the upper class. Fleck’s mother calls him a savior, while a protestor on the street holds up a sign that reads “Fascist Wayne is to Blame.” All the while, trash piles up in the streets because of a garbage strike, and the city is growing infested by a breed of super rats. The world seems to be wearing away at its edges. 
At the center of this world is Fleck, our sympathetic, even endearing protagonist. He wants to pursue comedy, but he lacks the social awareness to make people laugh. He wants to get better, but his treatment is cut short due to a lack of city funding. He longs for human connection, but his oddities estrange him from others. The movie does not treat Fleck as condemnable, but should it have to? Moral ambiguity in cinema is not an inherent wrong, even when it strays into such troubling waters as humanizing a mass murderer. 
The critics’ moral panic — that “Joker” might inspire another shooting — is terrifyingly fitting to the movie’s themes. The reception may have been more favorable if Phoenix had played a comic book villain, amoral beyond all relatability. The public in the movie prefers to see this version, the insane killer clown, on their newspapers’ front pages. None acknowledge — nor seek to acknowledge — the reasons for his atrocity. Fleck acts out because he is mentally ill, and he has been mistreated. Fleck kills because he has been given a gun. 
Phoenix’s Joker is a disconcerting character, and maybe that’s because he reminds us of a real person. In the real world, the killers aren’t monsters in clown makeup. The real killer is human; he acts on human rationales. He might be sitting next to you.

Sustainability and climate change are at the forefront of the national conversation — for college students, they are also an imminent issue. Young activists are challenging their universities to rethink where they invest and from whom they are receiving money. Specifically, students are asking their schools to divest from fossil fuels.
Think of divesting as the opposite of investing. It’s getting rid of stocks, bonds or investment funds that are unethically or morally ambiguous, like those relating to fossil fuel sponsorship. It means cutting ties with coal, oil and natural gas companies by moving money out of these sectors and into others, such as renewable energy, which reduce campus carbon footprints.
USC is a private institution that is not obligated to disclose the details of their investments, meaning it’s difficult for the community to find out exactly where their endowment is invested. The main information accessible to the public is in their yearly financial report, hardly a comprehensive or exhaustive document. However, large institutions with significant endowments invest in the fossil fuel industry, though students at schools like Harvard, Yale universities and the UCs have been calling for divestment for years. 
It is also true that USC has received donations from prominent figures in the oil industry such as former President of The Superior Oil Company W.M. Keck, who, in 1999, donated the $110 million needed to build the Keck School of Medicine. It would be impossible to monitor every donation or investment USC makes, but there must be a desire for openness and transparency. The public, should have a right to know how their institutions manage money. And with a $5.5 billion endowment, USC has a lot of money to manage. 
Refusing to support the fossil fuel industry would be monumental. The main argument against divestment is that a school’s endowment should not be used to achieve social or political change. Instead, it should be about making financially stable investments. Even if an institution balks at the idea of making a political statement, the numbers don’t lie. This year, the UC system officially pledged to make their $13.4 billion endowment fossil free. The chief investment officer for the UC system and the chairman of the Board of Regents’ investments committee revealed that the decision was not born of political pressure, but financial stability. Even after selling $150 million in fossil fuel assets, the UC system saw a $2.4 billion increase in assets over five years. 
The UCs join a small group of institutions who have fully or partially divested, including the University of Glasgow, Middlebury College, Columbia University, Seattle University and Stanford University. These schools are not simply finding investment alternatives. They are committing to sustainable practices on campus by becoming nationwide leaders in sustainability. Middlebury College, for example, plans to cut energy consumption on campus by a quarter and supply all of its renewable energy from local sources.
More importantly, institutions should divest because it’s a moral imperative. Universities such as USC pride themselves on being pioneers in research, technology, business and the sciences, yet they continue to financially support companies and accept help from individuals who contradict these values. We are expected to use what we learn to make the world a better place. But how can we go on to save our planet when our institutions play a part in fueling its demise? Can we even tackle this issue without complete transparency?
The inauguration of President Carol Folt ushers in a new era for sustainability at USC. With a bachelor’s in aquatic biology and a master’s in biology, as well as a doctorate degree in ecology, it is no surprise environmentalism and on-campus sustainability are at the core of her agenda. Given her scientific background and her desire for a student-driven presidency, Folt could be an important ally and bridge between students and administrators. Students need to demand change in what could be, for the first time in a long time, a receptive audience. 
Recently, at USC’s Climate Strike, student leaders and professors called on the school to divest and encouraged students to pursue green business practices in their personal careers. Folt joined the crowd, stating how overjoyed she felt seeing students protesting. “It means the world,” she told them. 
Divestment, while a small sliver in a larger conversation, is a crucial starting point.

The No. 4 Trojans missed an opportunity for revenge in a narrow 12-11 loss to No. 3 Pacific this past Saturday. It is the first time the Tigers have defeated USC twice in the regular season.
In a game that was neck-and-neck throughout, the outcome came down to missed opportunities on exclusions and defensive mishaps.
“Offensively [exclusions were] definitely the reason why [we lost], but again, our defense is the reason why we actually lost the game,” head coach Marko Pintaric said following the match. “We allowed natural goals from the center position that we, as a team, wanted to make a statement not to give up those goals.” 
USC’s defensive focus was apparent from the start, as Pacific’s first two shots on goal were blocked by junior driver Jacob Mercep. After two more drives ended with no score, redshirt senior utility Luke Pavillard put the first point on the board for the Tigers. The Trojans answered back with goals by drivers sophomore Hannes Daube and senior Marin Dasic to give USC an early lead. 
With just over three minutes to go in the first, 2-meters sophomore Jake Ehrhardt and Matt Maier received their first exclusions. After a quick timeout, the Tigers took advantage on the power play as senior attacker Engin Ege Colak evened the score to 2-2.
Pacific won the sprint to start the second, and Ehrhardt received his second exclusion for a penalty foul. The Tigers weren’t able to take advantage until a turnover allowed freshman utility Jeremie Cote to put one in the back of the net. The advantage was short-lived, as Dasic scored on USC’s following drive. 
After another turnover, Daube received his first exclusion for a minor act of misconduct. Pacific repeated its timeout strategy and freshman attacker Matthew Hosmer was able to score the Tigers’ fourth goal. Pacific had little time for complacency, as Mercep scored on a penalty shot to equalize the score yet again. 
With three minutes left in the half, Pacific scored on back-to-back drives on shots by Colak and senior utility Andrea De Nardi. The next three drives saw three exclusions from USC redshirt senior 2-meter Sam Slobodien, Mercep and Dasic, which resulted in a goal by senior attacker Luis Araya. With a few more missed shots on both sides and another exclusion for Mercep, the second period closed with USC just trying to keep it starters from getting kicked out of the game. 
The third quarter started with USC’s Slobodien adding his name to the scoresheet. At almost three minutes in, sophomore 2-meter Bogdan Djerkovic scored for the Tigers, bringing their lead to 8-5. Both teams ramped up their attack, with Ehrhardt sending one in with four minutes left, Pacific answering on the next drive, and Slobodien scoring on a 6-on-5 to bring the teams within two points. 
Maier then received his second exclusion, but a quick block from redshirt junior utility Luka Karaman prevented another power play score by the Tigers. Just over a minute later, Maier received his third exclusion and was the first starter to foul out. Redshirt junior driver Luke Wyatt fired in a goal which was quickly answered by Pacific. However, USC was not finished yet — another goal from Dasic brought the score to 9-10 heading into the fourth.
The fourth quarter started relatively calmly, as USC relied on its defense to keep Pacific from expanding its lead. Mercep scored three minutes in to tie things up at 10. On the next drive Ehrhardt received his third and final exclusion, leaving two USC starters out of the final quarter. 
“We had to instruct our players to get outside of their comfort zone and start dropping deeper,” Pintaric said regarding the team’s adjustments. “And even though they’re smaller players, they have to go behind bigger players, relying on a drop not to get ejected. So it did affect the way our defense originally was planned.”
After another timeout, Pacific’s De Nardi scored to put the Tigers ahead. A goal from Slobodien put USC in contention for an overtime effort, but it was a final goal from Pacific’s Araya with three and a half minutes left that made the final score 12-11. 
With their overall record now standing at 9-3, the Trojans will look to improve their away game streak against Pepperdine this Saturday at 2 p.m.

The prevalence of sexual assault among USC students increased slightly and rates of reporting incidents went up significantly between 2015 and 2019, according to results from a campus climate survey conducted at USC and dozens of other universities. 
The Association of American Universities Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct, which was open from April to May, surveyed 8,380 students. The weighted data attempts to reflect the entire student population.
The survey was first released to USC students in 2015 after various universities in AAU created it to look at data on sexual assault and misconduct across campuses. The 2015 survey was the largest study of these issues among college students.
“One of the things that many of us in the field realized was that we really didn’t have good information on how often it was happening, what did students know about it, [if they] were accessing resources and what [we] could use to better design our prevention and response protocols,” said Sarah Van Orman, chief health officer at USC Student Health.
Van Orman said the survey helped the University understand how common issues of sexual assault and reporting of such incidents are across college campuses. The 2019 survey, which was launched at 33 universities across the United States, compared data from the 2015 survey. 
According to the report, the prevalence of sexual assault among USC students increased from 19.3% to 20.5% for undergraduates and from 2.8% to 4.1% for graduate students. The report also found that the rate of reporting incidents from students who experienced sexual assault increased significantly from 13.9% to 31.5% for undergraduates and from 10% to 28.5% for graduate students.
The survey results come nearly two weeks after the Department of Public Safety released its annual security and fire safety report two weeks ago, which showed increased reports of rape and fondling on campus. According to the report, DPS reported 118 sex offenses on campus and in the surrounding community, marking an increase from 34 reports in 2017. According to the report, there were 68 reports of rape and four reports of fondling related to former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, who is accused of sexually assaulting more than 800 former patients. Unrelated to the former gynecologist, there were an additional 24 reports of rape and 21 reports of fondling.
In the wake of these revelations, Van Orman said the percent of USC undergraduate women who have experienced sexual assault since entering USC is slightly lower than that of other universities surveyed. However, at USC, the number of women who experienced assault increased by 1.2% from 2015 to 2019. Despite this slight increase, Van Orman said the survey revealed other areas where the University has improved.
“One of those areas is there’s a question about reporting … that includes reporting to an office that does investigation like Title IX or DPS, it also includes reaching out to confidential resources like RSVP or counseling and mental health,” Van Orman said. “At USC we saw doubling in rates of reporting for women, and for men we saw a tripling of rates. I view that as a really positive thing that more students who experience these are reaching out and getting assistance.”
Though rates of reporting at USC increased from 2015 to 2019, the survey indicates that more than 80% of students who experienced sexual harassment did not report the incident to USC. 
“We know that these issues are very complex, and USC, like many campuses, has made investments, particularly in the past couple of years in prevention and education,” Van Orman said. “But, if we are really going to reduce incidents of these situations, we need to make much more investments in education and prevention, and I think that prevention activities have to do with a whole culture change.”
In September, USC created the AAU Task Force, which is co-chaired by Van Orman and Vice President of Student Affairs Winston Crisp. It comprises members of the University administration, Title IX office, Graduate Student Government, Undergraduate Student Government and the Rossier School of Education.
The task force will host town halls at the University Park Campus and at the Health Sciences Campus Tuesday to discuss the results of the survey with the community. Members of the task force will answer questions from the community, listen to student concerns and introduce various resources.
“Part of what we’re charged to do over the next six months is look at this data, talk with our communities, share it across campus and then develop a report,” Van Orman said. “That report will contain recommendations that should be our roadmap for the next three to five years to figure out: What are the things that we need to do more of?”
Van Orman hopes that new initiatives introduced this past year will address some of these issues. USC Student Health launched Trojans Respect Consent at the start of the year, which requires all incoming first-year undergraduate students to participate in a 90-minute workshop on affirmative consent. According to Van Orman, the program has already seen 1,500 student participants and looks to work with thousands more.
The AAU survey results also laid out some of the policy programs and initiatives that USC has implemented in the past few years to address sexual assault, sexual misconduct and gender-based violence. 
According to the report, USC added one more therapist who specializes in sexual trauma, adopted trauma-informed principles in USC Student Health practices, trained two panels of advisors to assist Title IX offices, established a bystander training program with USG and hired a campus sexual assault prevention specialist. 
The report also said that the University hopes to create a sexual assault survivor advocates program that is dedicating to providing dedicated 24/7 on-call assistance to survivors. The initiative is anticipated to launch later this year. 
“[The survey] is just data, but it represents real students’ experiences and it lets us respond in ways that can be better effective and can guide our efforts to reduce the harm that happens to an individual student.” 
This article has been updated for clarity to accurately reflect that the number of undergraduate women experiencing sexual assault is lower than that of other AAU universities surveyed.

During the day, students quickly cut through campus on foot or by bike, scooter or skateboard as they rush to class, causing heavy traffic congestion in front of Tommy Trojan and, at times, accidents. To address the issue, yellow jacket officers are now patrolling Hahn Plaza with yield signs to get students to hop off their rides. 
After an increase in reported bike collisions this school year, the Department of Public Safety has begun to enforce Hahn Central Plaza as a dismount zone for all riders this semester. USC Village is also a dismount zone. 
DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said that the traffic collisions reported to DPS are not reflective of the problem as a whole because many accidents are not reported. There were 15 reports of traffic collisions last school year compared to the 19 that have been reported from this year alone, he said. 
Carlisle said that because student safety is a priority, yellow jackets have been asking students to dismount their bicycles, scooters and skateboards and walk across “pedestrian safety zones,” which include campus intersections with heavy traffic like USC Village and Hahn Plaza.
“We are trying to get the cooperation of students who ride those devices, whether it’s a bicycle, skateboard or a scooter by placing yellow jackets around the center of campus, around Tommy Trojan, which is our highest traffic area,” Carlisle said. “We are asking students to be courteous and ride carefully.”
Some students agree with the strict implementation of the dismount policy in Hahn Plaza and USC Village — popular locations on campus where accidents are likely to occur. 
“I’ve noticed that it’s very busy and there are a lot of cars that pass through and a lot of people that usually walk across campus,” said David Kim, a freshman majoring in human biology. “I usually think that’s why there’s a lot of people holding signs there, so we can prevent future accidents.”
However, efforts to have students dismount their bikes and boards have failed to be fully effective. It is a challenge to enforce the USC Bicycle Policy because the interactions at the intersection are often quick, Carlisle said. Students are able to find ways to hide from DPS officers or ignore signs telling students to walk through the plaza.
“There are some areas where [the DPS patrols] do not check and some people still continue to ride their bikes or skate or scoot,” said Teresa Tran, a freshman majoring in computer science and business administration. “I felt guilty when I didn’t follow the rule … when I heard the news of what happens — the accidents that happen there — I decided to start walking there instead of using my bike.”
Regardless, many students remain frustrated with the policies because they do not believe this is the best solution. 
“I understand why that’s been put in place, theoretically, but I don’t think it’s the best way to solve the problem,” said Langston Siebens, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies. “I think students are going to end up doing whatever they want, and it’s hopeless to stop people from riding through that intersection.”
There are a variety of suggestions for improving bike safety, but there are mixed opinions. 
Tran said bike lanes throughout campus, instead of just on walking paths like Trousdale Parkway, would be a better solution. The lanes on campus have been difficult to see, so students often walk in those designated areas, disrupting student riders, she said. Additionally, on surface streets throughout campus, there are no bike lanes. 
But Carlisle said the University considered alternative solutions and conducted research before placing yellow jackets throughout campus to curb accident rates. 
“There’s a group of University representatives … that has gathered input from a number of groups, and it’s part of research for a longer range traffic control plan for campus,” Carlisle said. “In the past, we had working groups, which had students, faculty, staff and representatives of bicycle enthusiasts.” 
Ultimately, Carlisle encourages all bicyclists and skateboarders to respect campus policies and yield signs.
“This is not a DPS decision,” Carlisle said. “This is a University decision.”
