On Saturday, 88rising held its first Head in the Clouds music festival at Los Angeles State Historic Park. The media company, popular for its lineup of Asian artists like Rich Brian, Joji and Keith Ape, drew an incredibly diverse crowd with an equally eclectic roster of performers. 
The park, studded with inflated balloons marked “88,” featured various food trucks, including Howlin’ Rays, an L.A. chicken staple and a Guess pop-up shop. The festival kicked off right at 3 p.m. with opener Diablo, followed by DJ Don Krez. Krez played a few songs from his latest album “prequel,” as people started trickling into the festival. 
Indie artist Sen Morimoto — dressed from the pages of a Muji catalogue with his long black hair, olive linen pants and printed white t-shirt — lulled the audience into a relaxed mood with low-fi beats and smooth raps heavy with internal rhyme. 
Rapper AUGUST 08 took the stage later, playing  “Lately” and “Missed Calls,” before bringing out rapper DUCKWRTH as a surprise addition to the lineup. They used the latter half of their set to commemorate rappers XXXTentacion and Mac Miller, both of whom passed away this year, delivering an emotional rendition of “Funeral.”
The transitions between later acts were messy — the artists and genres contrasted so much that hordes of people left the stage as another wave rushed in between sets. 
Japanese hip-hop artist KOHH set the bar for energy high, storming out in a studded black jacket, which he tore off during his first song to reveal what looked like a rainbow-patterned laptop case strapped to his chest. 
NIKI, the only female artist on the lineup, claimed the coveted dusk slot, and both her music and the warm-toned visuals projected onto the stage behind her provided a sharp contrast to KOHH’s charged set. She opened with “Newsflash!” and fans waved their arms to the chorus: “Go be someone else’s hangover!” A stripped-down rendition of “Dancing with the Devil” revealed a softer side to her elusive persona and, like an annotation of her album, she crafted a story arc over the span of five songs.
Higher Brothers, a Mandarin-speaking rap quartet, came on after and fans often struggled to keep up with its lyrics. Keith Ape appeared shortly after, and played a short set, including “IT G MA,” the viral song that brought 88Rising to the limelight. 
It’s not unusual that lineups become delayed over the course of a festival but through the night, the schedule slipped behind a half hour, only catching up at the very end. Producer Murda Beatz played a set that felt drawn-out, featuring a mix of songs he produced for artists like Drake and Travis Scott.
In a red Adidas tracksuit, Japanese-Australian record producer Joji took the stage next, resetting the crowd’s mood with his “sad boy” beats and personal anecdotes. His recurring interjection, “unblock me b-tch!” became the catch phrase of the night as he sang about heartbreak in “SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK” and unrequited love in “Yeah Right.” Unfortunately, Joji sapped up the crowd’s energy, and the dancing that Murda Beatz evoked was replaced with slow swaying and half-closed eyes.
The wait for the last act of the lineup was unexpectedly short; after a 10-second countdown, Indonesian rapper Rich Brian emerged, bringing every audience member to their feet, yelling.
Rich Brian exhibited the most personable stage presence, but the immaturity that disappeared with his former moniker “Rich Chigga” shone through once again. Between songs, he asked if anyone in the crowd was under 18, calling them “children” and then advised everyone in the crowd to “light up your crack cocaine!” But Rich Brian was also the first of the evening to note the vast diversity of the crowd, and proclaimed he was proud that the Asian community came out to a festival run by a company that was originally branded as “VICE for Asian culture.”
He played songs from his latest album, including “Cold” and “Amen,” closing out his set with the song that kick-started his rap career: “Dat $tick.” Immediately after, Brian launched into “Midsummer Madness,” and the rest of his labelmates flocked onstage to end the night with their collective album, “Head in the Clouds.”
Those who came to Head in the Clouds for the sheer breadth in artists under 88rising’s label may have gone home satisfied, but for those who came for a single artist (or waited six hours for Rich Brian) might have been off-put by the extreme variations in genres, moods and themes of the lineup. 
Rather than playing extremes back to back, the night could have arced in mood to build up to the headlining acts, though it does not help that Joji and Rich Brian have very different styles. Softer R&B acts like NIKI and Zion T. could have led into the various producers, to bridge the genres, before finally bringing out the harder rap artists like KOHH and Higher Brothers to amp up the energy for the final acts. 
Despite the lack of good pacing and consideration of the sheer festival length, the variety of audience members and artists captured precisely what the label and festival set out to do — make a space for minorities in hip-hop and share Asian culture.

Professionals from media industries spoke about the #TimesUp movement and the role celebrities and public figures play in spreading it. They also discussed the challenges of working in the field as women. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
The #MeToo movement has made its way into the Supreme Court with the recent allegations against Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh. To discuss the controversial Kavanaugh nomination and the subsequent progression of Hollywood’s #TimesUp movement, associate professor of professional practice at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Mary Murphy hosted a public panel for her Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society course on Monday evening in the Wallis Annenberg Hall auditorium. 
Murphy and her students were joined by professionals within the entertainment and journalism fields who spoke about women in today’s media: Debra Bergman, senior vice president of production at Paramount Television; Sara Fischer, head of production at Shondaland; Julie Richardson, a Hollywood producer and screenwriter; and Nithya Raman, executive director of #TimesUp Entertainment.
“We need to pay attention to the entertainment industry,” Murphy said. “The industry portrays what is happening in our country to the world … Movies and television are so important to our culture … they’re the message boards that tell the world how we live in America.”  
Raman addressed the history and the evolution of the #MeToo and the #TimesUp movements, saying that #MeToo was created in response to the Harvey Weinstein scandal. She said that because of the pervasive violence against vulnerable individuals in the industry, women in media have come together to combat this issue. 
“[The movement] takes people’s individual workplace struggles and [made] them into a shared struggles and to make them into, really, a political struggle to reshape the industry,” Raman said.
Bergman explained her challenges working in the male-dominated field of television production. According to her, the #TimesUp movement pinpoints conscious bias and topics people are hesitant to discuss. 
The panelists also discussed the role of celebrities and public figures in the movement. For example, celebrities wore black in support of the #TimesUp movement during the 2017 Golden Globes to express their disapproval of sexual assault and violence. 
“All these super famous actresses brought with them activists from the farm workers, to the restaurant workers, to the domestic workers … these  incredible women whose stories that would not be told, or told as eloquently and as quickly,” Fischer said. 
Richardson discussed how the movement gave her the opportunity to become a director and a mentor to people entering the entertainment field. 
Fischer spoke about her personal experiences at the Shondaland Company, which she said was open to creativity; however, other panelists noted that Shondaland is the exception, not the norm.
As Raman said, only 24 percent of producers in last year’s big-budget films were women. Each panelist agreed that the lack of female leadership roles and empowering content were some of the biggest issues in media and entertainment.
Fischer also mentioned that hundreds of women had voiced that they went into the field of medicine and healthcare after seeing female protagonists like Meredith Grey on shows like “Grey’s Anatomy,” a Shondaland production. 
In addition to discussing women in media, the panelists concluded on the topic of the Kavanaugh hearings, which has recently garnered media attention due to the accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee.
“How we treat Kavanaugh and how seriously we take the women who are coming forward with accusations against him is a marker of how we are responding to issues of sexual harassment in our society,” Raman said. “It’s the last gasp of an old regime that is changing.”

Preparing to serve · Sergeant Ralph Roseli (left) trains new DPS officers like Derrick County (right). County, along with fellow officer-in-training Triston Gibson, graduated from the Los Angeles Police Department Academy after studying police procedures for over six months. (Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan)
I
n the early hours of the morning, when most students are still asleep and the USC campus is dimly lit with the yellow glow of streetlights, Department of Public Safety officers-in-training Derrick County and Triston Gibson prepare for foot patrol. Their blue uniforms, complete with badges adorning their chests and belts bearing meticulously organized defense equipment, are crisply pressed. It’s their fourth week on campus, and the new officers want to be prepared and ready to learn. 
On Aug. 31, County and Gibson graduated from the Los Angeles Police Department Academy after  training for over six months. Now, they face an additional four-month training period with DPS before becoming sworn in as public safety officers. During this time, they will work closely with more experienced officers to learn how to interact with community members, as well as grasp technical skills like documenting reports, operating vehicles and responding to calls. 
For the two Southern California natives, the USC campus and surrounding community are familiar. However, they now approach the well-known streets through the lens of upholding safety. And on a campus where DPS has faced criticism for racial profiling, County and Gibson aim to build connections with their community and serve students first. 
California born and raised
For County, this dedication to community safety stemmed from his father, a Los Angeles sheriff’s deputy. Growing up in Los Angeles, County watched his father dedicate himself to serving his community, a practice that came to shape his career.
“My father just always told me ‘remain humble,’” County said. “If you want it, then you have to have the drive … to go out and get it.”
Before joining DPS as a public safety officer, County worked as a community service officer at USC, responding to minor incidents like fire alarms and providing safety escorts on campus. 
During foot patrols, County likes to engage with students to gather feedback on how DPS can improve its service to the community. During the encounters, County said students often suggest places they think would benefit from additional security. 
Gibson came to DPS with a similar interest in law enforcement. While studying for a degree in criminal justice, he worked as a security guard at a local bank for eight years, an experience he said taught him how to interact with people in need. 
Working with police
County graduated from the LAPD Academy as the class leader, a position he said is given to a recruit who demonstrates leadership skills, testing proficiency and a dedication to teamwork and career building.
“Some people could be down that day, and [it] just [means] saying ‘I’m here for you if you need me,’” County said. “Sometimes, you might actually have to study with the person [or] you might actually have to [practice] arrest and control procedures.”
DPS officers receive the same training as members of the police force, a standard employed for peace officers across California.  Although the training program is followed by a 40-hour work week, County said he had to put in extra effort to incorporate the lessons he learned into his off-duty life. 
For Gibson, working with other recruits at the LAPD Academy motivated him to do his best during this rigorous schedule. He also spent time practicing on his own and kept thoughts of his fiance in mind during challenging moments, like passing firearm safety training.
“It is motivating to watch other recruits work and see how hard they work,” Gibson said. “It keeps you going.”
Ongoing training
Though Gibson and County graduated from the LAPD training, DPS will continue to prepare them for specific interactions on the USC campus, according to DPS Field Training Officer Randall Martinez.
“The reason why we continue to train is to maintain a level of consistency and professionalism,” Martinez said. “We want to make sure that they give the utmost 100 percent professionalism to anybody out there.”
Sergeant Ralph Roseli, who has worked with DPS for 21 years, also works to train new DPS officers, helping them address any gaps in knowledge and develop leadership and communication skills.
“I think after receiving an outstanding education and experience such as LAPD Academy, one feels like there is a certain amount of knowledge one has, but when you come to apply it to the real life in a field training program, suddenly you realize that you don’t know as much,” Roseli said.
Martinez said he supports trainees like Gibson by passing along his perspective on the realities of law enforcement.
“I wanted to be a field training officer so that I can pass on my ethics to my trainees,” Martinez said. “I am a little hard on some trainees, to get them to work at the level that I would love them to work.”
Even after a few weeks of working together, Martinez noted Gibson’s work ethic and maturity as traits that set him apart in training. He said these qualities help him collaborate with others and making them feel more relaxed and at ease. 
“I see him as an outstanding officer, someone who actually cares for this community — someone who really wants to put his mark in this University,” Martinez said. “I see him teaching others the way he has been taught and … doing great things for this University.”
Gibson has also learned from Martinez’s mentorship as his training officer.
“The main thing [I have learned] is to show initiative and pay attention to the little details because those little details could be what you need at the end to make everything come together,” Gibson said.

If you ride the Metro Expo line toward Santa Monica from USC, you’ll pass nearly a dozen of new art galleries protruding along the working-class neighborhoods flanking the route. Bold, shiny and avant-garde industrial, they’re staggeringly out of place as heralds of gentrification. Los Angeles, a global art center characterized by economic disparities, has long been at the center of the escalating battle between artists and activists. 
We in South Central L.A., and within the most financially privileged institution in the area — are no strangers (though we have the luxury of blissful passivity) to the city’s current housing crisis. It has uprooted thousands of families and accelerated homelessness by an astonishing 75 percent in the last six years. The art world has emerged as a prime battleground for the gentrification of vulnerable communities — in fact, arts districts have become practically synonymous with the idea of displacement and the process of affluent artists encroaching local residents. 
In the East L.A. neighborhood of Boyle Heights, newly arrived artists and deeply rooted communities live in dense proximity at the intersection of establishment and redevelopment. Predominantly Latinx residents fear that the influx of gallery spaces will lead to the erasure of their culture and have formed groups that demand the galleries relocate to other parts of the city. Meanwhile, developers are intent on reaping the profits of building cultural destinations in up-and-coming neighborhoods as part of a broader plan to minimize the damages of gentrification through “artwashing.” 
For residents, the opening of new galleries are some of the first harbingers of impending dislocation as they indicate property values will soon skyrocket and invite more affluent investors and neighbors. But for artists — pioneers of artwashing, if you will — the opening of new galleries represent the birth of artistic communities where they get to lay the groundwork for cultural richness to blossom (as if pre-existing cultures in these neighborhoods are not already rich). 
At least four Boyle Heights galleries have shut down since 2016, following years of protests by local residents and public fights with activist groups. But moving your unwelcome business to a glossier part of town is nothing compared to the trauma of being evicted from a home your family has lived in for many generations. 
The messages from longtime residents in Boyle Heights that they don’t want art galleries in their neighborhoods are not a refusal of all art; they are a refusal of the dangers artists represent because they are not inclusive of residents’ narratives. Art should be something that everyone, regardless of age, race or creed, can enjoy because it is so inherent to the human experience. I lament the fact that art becomes an alienating force when certain powerful entities operate with indignance, blindly unaware of their own roles as structures of oppression. 
We are at a pivotal moment when art and gentrification are inextricably intertwined, yet both sides of the debate vilify the other. It’s time for artists to reexamine and reinvent their roles in the displacement of the populations they impose their galleries on. It’s time for galleries and museums to recognize their complicity in the finance capital responsible for gentrification. It’s time they start considering how they might learn from sociopolitical clashes rather than simply throwing their hands up in defeat and moving away. 
Artists must listen and educate themselves on the struggles low-income residents face and acknowledge their own privilege in comparison. If they are going to move to disadvantaged  areas and drastically alter, they must understand that they are contributing to the first wave of gentrification and take steps to ameliorate their impact. Whether by rallying for housing justice, donating time and money to causes that will better the community or refraining from criminalizing people of color by calling the cops on protestors, artists need to make a change and realize that they are not the victims in these confrontations. 
It’s also important for artists to reconsider the gallery spaces in which they choose to participate. They must ask themselves whether it’s worth patronizing an art space that doubles as an investment project that could cause someone to lose their home; artists’ careers should never be upheld above the needs of the gentrified. In creating art, artists must remember that their work is a powerful indicator as to who is included in popular discourse in the first place. Apportioning minority groups temporary visibility by tokenizing their cultures is not going to cut it — artists must reckon with their power as part of institutions and create works that exhibit, comment on and empathize with minority experiences rather than co-opting them. Even better, galleries cropping up in gentrified areas should make it a point to showcase locally-sourced art that encapsulates rather than stifles the longstanding spirits of such communities. 
The art world is at a crossroads when it comes to artists intruding on spaces and cultural histories that are not theirs. It will take time to foster an environment wherein art and expression within certain communities are not inevitably linked to the displacement of its core residents. For now, the most important thing we can do is continue the dialogue and be proactively respectful and inclusive. 
Whether artists like it or not, they are entangled in the onslaught of gentrification their industry brings — the least they can do is listen and learn.

Last week, the Daily Trojan reported that USC graduate student Robert L. Walker II’s USC email is linked to a username that was active in a chatroom used to organize the deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va. last year. The Daily Trojan reported that there was a nationwide warrant issued for his arrest for failing to show up to court on a fourth-degree felony charge. This revelation has raised the question of whether or not the University knew about the student’s criminal history before accepting him into the graduate engineering program. 
Similarly, debate has arisen over the Common App’s decision to remove a question about applicants’ past criminal arrests and convictions for the 2018-19 school year. 
While it is undoubtedly important for colleges to be informed about an applicant’s criminal background if one exists, the Common App’s removal of the question is the right decision. This is true for three reasons. There is no demonstrable link between campus safety and students with criminal records; the policy would remove application barriers for those who need higher education the most; and universities can already obtain this information without asking applicants to self-report. 
According to The American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, there is neither evidence that screening for criminal histories increases campus safety, nor is there any evidence suggesting that students with criminal records commit crimes on campus in any way or at any rate that differs from students without criminal records. 
In addition, colleges and universities that don’t ask students to provide their criminal history information do not report that their schools are less safe as a result, according to the same research. Therefore, there is little correlation between screening for criminal histories and campus safety.
Secondly, colleges have the responsibility to provide an education to all who are qualified, especially to deserving applicants with criminal histories who would benefit the most from a college degree.
Research led by Cal State, Los Angeles revealed that many convicted youths are cycled back into the juvenile justice system, and a lack of higher education was a consistent pattern among those who were re-arrested.
Because part of a university’s job is to provide qualified low-income students with opportunities they would not otherwise have, it is essential that qualified juvenile offenders — most of whom come from low socioeconomic backgrounds, according to a study from Northwestern University — seek out and obtain a college education. It would not only benefit them, but also the greater community when they are pushed out of the criminal justice system’s cycle of trouble with the law. 
The State University of New York found that qualified students were deterred from applying to college because of the Common App’s criminal history question; this finding is particularly troubling. If qualified students are choosing not to apply to receive a college education, they are much more likely to remain stuck in a cycle of crime. Universities can end this cycle by omitting the question and encouraging greater applications.
Finally, just because a student is not asked about his or her criminal history does not mean that a college cannot obtain this information with a simple background check. One study shows that only about two-thirds of all colleges conduct background checks on their applicants. 
Here’s the bottom line: Universities must find a common ground between keeping students safe and providing students with opportunities. A criminal conviction cannot define a person’s life as a college applicant, especially if that crime was non-violent. If schools truly value a holistic admissions process, they cannot reject an otherwise qualified student because of a single arrest or conviction they most likely committed as a minor. Doing so is too harsh of a punishment that will prevent them from being reformed and reintegrated into society. 
The power to punish juvenile convicts by refusing to consider them for admission is undoubtedly strong. But ultimately, the power to transform them by bringing them out of the criminal cycle is stronger. Universities should use less of the first power and more of the second.

Former USC receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster slated 96 yards on seven receptions last night against the Buccaneers. (Daily Trojan file photo)
The NFL season is underway and Week 3 has concluded with the first- and second-year Trojans making an impact on their respective teams. Along with a talented crop of rookies, former five-star recruits and receivers Adoree’ Jackson and JuJu Smith-Schuster have demonstrated the USC football program can develop talented players and take them to NFL stardom. 
Sam Darnold
Branded the face of the Jets franchise after a resounding 48-17 win in his debut against the Detroit Lions, rookie quarterback Sam Darnold struggled against the Browns in Week 3. The pressure was on Darnold on Thursday night to show the Browns they should not have passed on him in the draft with the No. 1 pick. 
After coming out hot to a 14-0 lead fueled by a strong ground game and consistent quarterback play, the Darnold-led offense sputtered. Following an injury to Browns quarterback Tyrod Taylor, rookie Baker Mayfield played his first real snaps. The pressure was even higher as the two highly touted rookies duked it out, but Darnold threw two critical interceptions that overshadowed his solid start to the game. These errors resulted in a 21-17 loss for the Jets.
JuJu Smith-Schuster
Another Pro Football Focus hero, second year wideout JuJu Smith-Schuster had a 134.0 passer rating on passes targeting him his rookie year, the highest for any rookie receiver in the last 10 years. It’s hard to say that Smith-Schuster is a breakout candidate because it feels like he has already broken out. In his first two games, he’s backed up his fan-favorite personality and eccentric touchdown celebrations with 240 receiving yards and a touchdown. With Le’Veon Bell out for the foreseeable future due to contractual issues, there will be plenty of opportunities for Smith-Schuster to showcase his talent.
Adoree’ Jackson
After posting an 82.3 Pro Football Focus grade and making it onto Pro Football Focus’ list of “Second Year Players Primed to Breakout in 2018,” second year cornerback, Jackson has not disappointed. While it’s hard to evaluate a cornerback’s performance based on statistics alone, Jackson has recorded plenty to justify the hype. In his second game against the divisional rival Texans, he demonstrated his athleticism while recording his first career interception over superstar receiver DeAndre Hopkins. Jackson has come into his own after a rollercoaster rookie year and is positioned to be a stud for the Titans, who hope to return to the playoffs this year.
Ronald Jones II
Rookie running back Ronald Jones II was taken in the second round of this year’s NFL Draft. Yet, in spite of the Bucs’ bottom ranking ground game, Jones has not played a snap with Peyton Barber and Jacquizz Rodgers ahead of him on the depth chart. In the NFL season’s third week, Jones hoped to have made more of an impact to balance the Bucs’ passing attack. He struggles to fit into the Bucs’ vertical offense as a player who doesn’t catch the ball much; Jones only had 32 catches his entire college career. As the Bucs’ backup quarterback, Ryan Fitzpatrick was thrust into the starting job and is averaging over 400 yards passing and four touchdowns over the first two weeks Jones will continue to find where he fits in.
Uchenna Nwosu
After striking fear into the hearts of Pac-12 quarterbacks last year, rookie outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu began what he hopes will be a reign of terror on quarterbacks at the next level when he recorded his first sack in Week 2 against the Bills. Otherwise, Nwosu has been relatively quiet on the stat sheet, but is seeing an uptick in snaps after only seeing two defensive snaps his first game. In spite of major injuries, the Los Angeles Chargers are eyeing a playoff berth, and Nwosu looks to be a key piece in a dominant defense this season.

Sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin recorded five of USC’s 10 kills in the final set against Colorado. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The USC women’s volleyball team emerged victorious from its five-set bout (25-18, 25-27, 25-19, 21-25, 15-10) against Colorado at the Coors Events Center on Sunday. The squad’s five-set match record now stands at 3-1. 
The Women of Troy enjoyed a strong start to the fifth set, doubling Colorado’s score at 10-5 and then trading points to claim it all at 15-10. The win was a tough back-and-forth affair, with flashes of brilliance from USC constantly being halted by a persistent Colorado offense. Sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin tallied five of USC’s 10 total kills in this nerve racking decider. Colorado senior outside hitter Alexa Smith responded with four kills (three of which were consecutive) to tie the game early at 4-4. The Buffaloes’ front row dished out 43 kills but were eventually unraveled by its own attack errors; this was an issue that also troubled the Trojans. In the face of a versatile and aggressive offense, Botkin stepped up during the match’s dying moments to deliver three crucial spikes, one of which served as the game-ender. 
Although the Trojans had left Colorado having earned their fifth consecutive win, the  clash was a turbulent weekend for the Trojans (10-3, 2-0 Pac-12). Following a win against crosstown rival UCLA, the Women of Troy had to handle the toll of travel. According to head coach Brent Crouch, playing away games has affected team energy levels in the past. Crouch gave his overall assessment shortly after the game, specifically citing a level of intensity. 
“I like how we responded to the times we were cut down a little bit,” Crouch said. “[Junior middle blocker Jasmine Gross] had a career day and we came back and finished the match off strong in the fifth. It’s always a good thing to do that, to turn things around when you don’t play as well as you wanted. And that’s a success moving forward.” 
Crouch also acknowledged how several other conditions made the game against the Buffaloes (9-4, 1-1 Pac-12) more difficult. These included adverse reactions to high altitudes, sickness and the sweltering gym temperature. Other setbacks also stifled the Women of Troy from the get-go. Botkin expanded on how the team had to face the lack of an ideal playing atmosphere. 
“It’s always difficult playing in Colorado’s gym because they bring out everyone to come and watch, so the gym is always loud and packed with Colorado fans,” Botkin said. “You feel like everyone’s against you.”
But the Trojans came out strong in the first set. After the game had reached 10-10, senior libero Victoria Garrick served to slide the Trojans into a 6-point lead. Garrick also led the team defensively, racking up 17 digs and six assists. Maintaining this comfortable score gap, the Trojans followed up by scoring back-to-back kills thanks to junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier and Gross. Both Lanier and Gross executed four kills in the opening set. 
The minor problems emerged shortly after, as USC tensed up in a combination of both in-game and external hindrances. The Women of Troy fell behind 4 points on two occasions in the second frame but eventually turned the tables at 24-22. In response, the Buffaloes dialed up 5 additional points to clinch the win, 27-25. 
A pattern became apparent as USC reaffirmed itself with a win in the third set. The Buffaloes were able to climb within one point of the Trojans at 18-17, but kills from Botkin and Lanier gave USC the momentum to earn a string of consecutive points, and ultimately the set. 
“[Lanier and I are] always hungry for the ball … we love getting set,” Botkin said. “We get the most balls, we get the most touches and we have a very important job of putting that ball down every time we get it so our team can score.” 
The fourth set saw the odds sway in favor of the Buffaloes once again. Colorado won 25-21 and had led by up 6 points on multiple occasions. However, the Women of Troy erased the memory of the previous set with a .474 hitting percentage in the deciding set of the match.
Freshman setter Raquel Lázaro continued to impress with her sixth double-double of the season (a career-high 58 assists and 16 digs). USC also saw 40 kills from outside hitters; Lanier tallied 21 and Botkin slated 19. The pair also added three service aces. 
Up next, the Women of Troy stay on the road to play No. 2 Stanford and Cal. As conference play heats up, Lanier talked about the how the new faces on the team have affected chemistry.
“I think coming in with a lot of new girls and expecting it to always be perfect is always frustrating,” Lanier said. “But the connection [and] the chemistry out there is getting so much better. When we do get in that groove, we can be unstoppable.”

Senior linebacker Cam Smith recorded a season high 15 tackles against the Washington State Cougars on Friday. (Tal Volk | Daily Trojan)
There is always someone who says this phrase. My grandma says it. My father says it. Even people I am not related to say it. There is always someone.
Even that one guy who, while watching the NFL highlights from the 1980s plastic table at the local public golf course and munching on a delectable assortment of overpriced and underfilled Cheddar Cheese Ruffles, a Snickers bar and a well, well-done hot dog, shouts this phrase from the back of the room for everyone to hear.
And while I might be inclined to agree with his surprisingly good choice in chips, I almost despise myself for agreeing with the phrase that dribbles off his cheese-stained lips quicker than the slightly-too-sugary original Coca-Cola he has been slurping down. 
I sigh, but it’s true: “Defense wins championships.”
Although the old adage might sound like nails on the chalkboard or Katy Perry’s overproduced fifth studio album to some, it is nevertheless true. Championship winning teams need a solid defense, and not just one that’s going to show up for a couple of quarters. 
The funny thing is that USC should know how important defense can be. After all, wasn’t it the crucial last-second Vince Young touchdown in the 2006 BCS National Championship that sealed the Trojans’ fate?
It is unbelievable how easily we can forget how important containing the opposing defense can be in winning titles. For the weak 52,000-plus fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Friday night — the lowest attendance for a USC game since 2002 against Oregon State — the 2018 Trojan defense did what they unfortunately do best: allow opposing offenses to execute their game plan to perfection. 
Interestingly enough, I was clamoring to USC football fans two weeks ago about how offensive coordinator Tee Martin’s job could potentially be in jeopardy. Now, 14 days and 73 points later,  I’m here not to call for defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s job, per se, but to proclaim that this USC coaching staff is one of the most inconsistent that we’ve seen in recent years. 
Every year, USC has been defined by one trait. Last year, USC was a sack-happy, option-heavy, Sam Darnold-loving  team that could do it on both sides of the ball. 
This season, it seems that this team forms a new identity every week. One week, the offense can’t seem to complete a pass. The next week, the defense can’t seem to stop a pass. The inconsistency needs to stop because I can’t keep changing which coach’s picture I staple to my dart board. 
Aside from the expensive costs of printer ink, the football team deserves better because it has the potential to be a top-10 defense, especially in the secondary. Upperclassmen cornerback Iman Marshall, nickel cornerback Ajene Harris and free safety Marvell Tell III  have played under Pendergast’s system before and succeeded. 
Why is it that the team cannot seem to stop big plays from Bryce Love, Lil’Jordan Humphrey or Easop Winston Jr. this season?
While coaches cannot be blamed for the unfortunate injuries or departures of Jack Jones, Isaiah Pola-Mao, Ykili Ross or Bubba Bolden, they can be responsible for the lack of development from the rest of the secondary that is healthy, including a boatload of top recruits. 
How is it possible that five-star shutdown corner Isaac Taylor-Stuart can sit idly by as his team’s defense gets destroyed play after play?
The fact that the Trojans’ secondary has yet to record a single interception in four games is no accident. It is definitely no accident that K.J. Costello and the Cardinal’s big tight ends were so effective in that 17-3 loss against Stanford. The Trojan linebackers simply cannot compete when it comes to covering bigger targets like Stanford’s Kaden Smith. 
Surely, they can stuff the run better than most teams in the Pac-12, but the linebacking corps pass-stopping abilities are a defensive liability. Time after time against Washington State, Gardner Minshew threw darts all over the field with little to no resistance from the porous USC zone scheme. 
If USC wants to even think about sniffing a Pac-12 Championship, its secondary and linebacking corps must find a way to stop the pass. Otherwise, those golf course hot dogs will never hear the end of it.

BSA, LSA and APASA shared statement criticizing USG’s decision to provide funding for an event hosted by the USC chapter of Young Americans for Freedom where Ben Shapiro is scheduled to speak. (Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan)
Multiple student groups criticized USC after the Undergraduate Student Government agreed last week to fund an event featuring conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, citing the use of funds for extra policing and its effects on student minority groups.
The Black Student Assembly, Latinx Student Assembly and Asian Pacific American Student Assembly shared an unsigned statement over the weekend denouncing USC and accusing the University of co-hosting Shapiro. While the event received funding from USG, the University administration will not pay for the event and is not a co-sponsor of it, a USC source told the Daily Trojan. 
Shapiro’s presence on college campuses has had a history of violence. Last September, nine people were arrested while protesting Shapiro at UC Berkeley; two were arrested during protests when Shapiro visited the University of Utah.
“The safety and lives of minority communities on the University of Southern California’s campus [are] in harm’s way,” said the statement, which also promoted the use of the hashtag #SoundTheAlarm. “[Shapiro] is known to be a purveyor of hate speech, including the eradication of entire races and discriminatory comments against a multitude of minority communities.”
Shapiro has made incendiary comments referencing race, sexuality and gender identity, such as accusing Arabs of enjoying violence — a statement he later apologized for — and calling transgender people mentally ill.
BSA was the first student organization to share the statement, but did not comment on whether member of the organization wrote it. LSA declined to comment and APASA did not respond in time for publication.
“We felt that students on campus — not just black students, but students of color … just need an opportunity to get to share their voice behind how they felt about this whole event taking place,” BSA leaders told the Daily Trojan. 
USC’s chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, a national conservative youth activism organization, announced in July that it would host Shapiro on Oct. 4. 
The statement alleged that USC would pay for security on campus that would include uniformed and undercover police officers, along with a K-9 Unit. 
Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas said in a statement to the Daily Trojan that K-9 units were “never part of the safety plan.”
“It is our responsibility to assess the needs and provide sufficient resources to ensure the safety of members of our campus community and event participants,” Thomas said in the statement. “Our role is to make sure that all parties on campus may safely exercise their first amendment rights in accordance with university policy.”
According to DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle, most of the security presence will be DPS officers, along with a “modest amount” of uniformed LAPD officers, but that city police will be on standby.
“I want to make it clear: DPS is not dissuading or denying anyone the right to demonstrate or protest or express themselves on campus,” Carlisle said. “We expect [our students] to behave responsibly and we don’t anticipate any problems. We’re there in the background, so to speak, to make sure that things remain peaceful.”
According to Maxwell Brandon, the chairman of USC chapter of YAF, the added security is not meant to “oppress minorities” or to stop a protest of the event, but to prevent violence.
“We’re not trying to squash anyone’s right to protest,” Brandon said. “We’re just trying to make sure that there’s not going to be any violence … [Police are] coming in as a First Amendment protection for both sides.” 
Brandon explained that the total cost of DPS and private security staff amounted to $15,000. USG is providing $4,100 from the discretionary fund, the maximum for individual organizations per academic year allowed according to the USG Funding Guide. YAF said it will cover the remainder of the cost through fundraisers.
“We have very strict funding guidelines where every recognized student organization, regardless of political affiliation, can apply for funding,” said USG President Debbie Lee. “If the application follows procedures and guidelines, then it’ll be passed.” 
YAF will allot $1,000 of the total cost to creating a designated area for students to protest. BSA leaders said, however, that they were unaware of the addition of the designated protest space. 
“BSA would like an opportunity to share our voices and we’re glad that they decided to do that,” BSA leaders told the Daily Trojan.

 The Engemann Student Health Center will install vending machines that will dispense self-care supplies by the end of the semester. (Daily Trojan file photo)
USC is taking a new approach to address student well-being on campus with Collective Impact, a new plan that has been in the works for several years. The strategy aims to encourage everyone across campus to work together toward common health goals. 
The new strategy is based on a Stanford University study from 2011. “Large-scale social change comes from better cross-sector coordination rather than from the isolated intervention of individual organizations,” the Stanford study states.
In other words, it’s harder to achieve positive change in any environment — business, school or government — without everyone involved having shared goals, according to the study. 
The Office for Health Promotion Strategy will serve as the “backbone” of this new strategy. Director Paula Swinford stressed the need for a common agenda, continuous communication, an alignment of activities and shared metrics. 
“If you go to some office, and you start talking about how drunk you were over the weekend, and the staff member says, ‘That’s just college,’ that would be a misalignment of communication, that we’re not communicating the same message,” Swinford said. 
She credits Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry with the new effort to prioritize student well-being on campus.
Critics of the study complain that the approach strays too far from direct service and harms minority groups. However, much is still unknown about the implementation of Collective Impact; USC is one of the first universities in the United States to adopt the approach campus-wide. 
Currently, there are four primary goals the strategy aims to achieve: equity and inclusion, individual and communal well-being, curbing substance abuse and healthy relationships. Students will see the plan start to take effect in the coming weeks and months, including self-care vending machines and increased funding for safer sex resources. 
Students can expect to see a self-care vending machine on campus by the end of the semester. It will contain Plan B, condoms, Tylenol and pregnancy tests, among other health supplies. 
According to Associate Vice Provost for Student Health and Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman, the idea was suggested to Student Health by USG in the spring.
The change comes at an opportune time, after the CDC reported on Aug. 28 that there were almost 2.3 million cases of STIs in the U.S. last year, the highest number ever reported.
“The fear of sexuality and sex is alive and well … California is ahead in many ways, but in other ways not so much,” said Diane Medsker, the senior learning and development specialist in the Office for Health Promotion Strategy.
In addition to the changes taking place on campus, USC Residential Education has begun to contribute additional funding for condoms and other sexual safety supplies. 
Emily Sandoval, the senior director of Residential Education, works closely with the new Collective Impact approach and is co-leading the third goal, addressing alcohol and substance abuse. 
“Paula had asked if I would be able to continue supporting the work that that office did with the condoms in the buckets, [and] I told her that I would be able to continue purchasing the condoms in bulk,” Sandoval said. 
In the past, RAs retrieved condoms from the Engemann Student Health Center to distribute to their residents. This year they are able to go directly to the ResEd offices, which orders thousands of condoms each month.
“It’s definitely been a change for RAs, because now all of [the resources] aren’t in a centralized space, but we know where to get them,” said Divya Sripathy, a third-year RA. 
The Office for Health Promotion Strategy wants to encourage students to participate in the new changes on campus. 
“I would say that anybody who wants to get involved in helping us get out a message around student well-being [should] email and say, ‘Hey, I want to get involved,’ because we are trying to be really organic in our creation of this process,” Swinford said.

The pantry is open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Students with self-identified good emergencies will be allowed to visit the pantry one time each week. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The University Emergency Food and Toiletry Pantry is set to open Monday in a new location, following increased demand for services from students facing food insecurity. 
The Food Pantry has moved from the Student Union to Parkside Apartments 135, a space that Gabriel Valenzuela, director of Campus Activities, said he hopes will be more accessible to students.
“The Food Pantry needed a larger footprint to be able to provide perishable and non-perishable products,” Valenzuela said. “In addition, the increased size will allow for food donations to be accepted.”
The Food Pantry is open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. In the coming weeks, Undergraduate Student Government plans to extend the pantry’s hours to include all five days with longer hours of operation, according to USG President Debbie Lee.
Once the Food Pantry opens, students will be allowed one visit per week to get up to three bulk and snack items, one prepared meal and one hygiene item, Valenzuela said. Students will be prompted to take a survey so the administration can better understand which resources need to be added to the Food Pantry, according to Alec Vandenberg, director of External Affairs for USG. 
Vandenberg said breaking down the stigma surrounding food insecurity — defined as an inability to reliably access affordable, nutritious food — is one of the most important steps toward helping students living within those circumstances. Often students have to deal with also being housing insecure and are forced to make a decision between going hungry and paying rent, Vandenberg said.
“At any level you’ll have people [saying that] this is a private university, there isn’t a need … and we know that’s not the case,” Vandenberg said.
According to the 2014 Hunger in America report conducted by Feeding America, about 30 percent of students said they were forced to choose between food and their education. 
The Food Pantry provides a temporary solution for students with self-identified food emergencies, Valenzuela said. It also has additional services such as an on-site social worker that can help determine students’ eligibility for CalFresh benefits, a form of government food assistance. 
Food-insecure students may also be eligible for Electronic Benefit Transfer, a prepaid card that students can use for food around Los Angeles as well as at the Wednesday farmer’s market on campus. 
USG is also experimenting with Market Match, a food program that matches CalFresh benefits to farmers markets, to further drive down the prices of groceries for students, Vandenberg said.
Lee said USG has focused on expanding these programs for students after noticing a need for more resources on campus, particularly when the Food Pantry opened for the first time last spring.
“A lot of students have been utilizing this resource since its beginning,” Lee said. “I think that’s very telling of the kind of support that is needed, especially for students that often go unseen on our campus.”
Students who want to help minimize the prevalence of food insecurity can contribute to the Food Pantry by volunteering or donating goods, Valenzuela said. 
Lee said the University’s main goal is to be able to support students without students needing to visit the Food Pantry.
“The Food Pantry is a transitional step into getting to that ideal state where all students are financially supported,” Lee said.

In his address to the Newcomen Society on April 7, 2005, former USC president Steven Sample proudly declared, “Our code of ethics is an outgrowth of our self-perception as a University founded on diversity, mutual respect and academic freedom.”
But this image of a University that has always been committed to noble values of inclusion is fabricated. In past years, there has been a movement on campus to rename the Von KleinSmid Center after its namesake, Rufus Von KleinSmid, was exposed as an outspoken eugenicist. Unfortunately, VKC is not the only part of campus that has been touched by a history of exclusion and racism.
Sample bases his argument for the University’s foundational commitment to diversity on the fact that the University’s three founders were a Protestant, a Catholic and a Jew. While that might sound like the setup to a “three guys walk into a bar” joke, the founders would have been considered a diverse group back when Los Angeles was predominantly white, once even branded as “The Great White Spot of America.” While the founders’ idea of diversity may have extended to white men and white women of different religions, their commitment faltered when considering people of different races.
Joseph Widney, whose name is attached to the Widney Alumni House, held extreme views on race — even for his era — and he wasn’t shy about sharing them. In his 1935 book, “The Three Americas: Their Racial Past and Dominant Racial Factors for Their Future,” Widney argues that the Americas, specifically California, were destined for “the Aryan race.” He writes that the arrival of Columbus was “the doom of [the] native peoples.” Widney doesn’t stop there. He argues that Native Americans living in California “could not resist: they could not absorb: they could only die.” He attributes this predetermined fate to some kind of natural “law” that human beings could do nothing to alter or stop. These do not sound like the academic theories and beliefs of a man who would instill a commitment to diversity in the University that his brother founded. Widney’s writings do not equate to Von KleinSmid’s horrific actions. Instead of erasing Widney’s name from campus history, the University should present a more complete and accurate portrayal and stop glorifying him as an infallible figure in the University’s past.
Twenty-seven years after USC’s founding, the University awarded its first degree to an African American student, John Alexander Somerville, who graduated with honors from the school of dentistry in 1907. On the surface, this may seem like a notable accomplishment, since this milestone occurred during a time when most of the country was actively suppressing opportunities for black Americans. However, Somerville’s autobiography, “Man of Color,” reveals a classroom environment that was openly hostile to the presence of a black man. He writes that there “was quite a commotion when they saw a colored face.” Somerville details how the students in his class threatened to drop out if the school administrators did not remove him from the University. While the dean of the dentistry school defended Sommerville’s right to attend, the students’ actions exposed the truth about a student body that was not ready to embrace students of color as equals. This shameful episode indicates a greater University culture of exclusion that ran so deep that students were willing to sacrifice their education in order to uphold their prejudices.
Considering these red marks on USC’s past, the idea that the University has been committed to diversity since day one sounds like a highly idealized version of our past. In his speech, Sample took a revisionist approach to USC’s history, choosing to ignore the ugly parts and instead glorifying the University’s so-called code of ethics. Sample centered his speech on what he refers to as “myths” surrounding USC, and he is careful to note that “many myths are absolutely true.”
This commitment to these “true myths” glosses over the struggles that successive waves of students of color have faced as they integrated the school over several generations. The University should not continue to sweep the problematic past of figures like Von KleinSmid and Widney along with the experiences of students like Sommerville under the rug. It should educate its students about both its failures and its successes.
USC has come a long way since the presence of one black student drove an entire class to threaten resignation. The University can demonstrate some pride in that progress. But that pride and an acknowledgement of the shameful words and actions of former faculty and students are not mutually exclusive. Hopefully future presidents will learn from their predecessors’ mistakes and not continue to present the University as simply a shining school on a pedestal. Beneath that shine are transgressions that deserve to be exposed, understood and overcome.

Jessie Chang | Daily Trojan
Saturday marked the first day of autumn, and as much as the 85-degree temperatures over the weekend seem to suggest otherwise, October is only a week away. It’s time to get ready for fall — start planning Halloween costumes, putting up decorative gourds and worrying about wildfires engulfing Los Angeles, lining the highways with hellish walls of flame and filling the sky with ash so thick that downtown is hardly visible from the USC campus. Wait, that last one might just be a personal thing.  
But unlike most of my anxious fears of natural disasters (I grew up in Washington, a state marked by its earthquakes, volcanoes and widespread neuroticism), the autumn wildfire season in California is actually worth worrying about and planning for. Students only need to think back to Fall 2017’s finals week, when the Skirball fire burned through 422 acres of the Bel-Air neighborhood, shutting down I-405 and canceling UCLA classes, to see the impact that wildfires can have on our generally isolated, urbanized life. As the region heads into another wildfire season, it is important that we recognize the threat wildfires pose and take action to prevent them as often as possible.
Now at this point you might be thinking, “Wait, didn’t wildfire season just end?” The answer is yes, sort of. A 2015 study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters divides Southern California’s wildfires into two seasons: the summer season, from June to September, and the Santa Ana winds wildfire season from October to April. 2018’s summer season just wrapped up, and was widely reported as the worst in recent times. The Mendocino and Carr fires are among the largest fires in California’s recorded history. 
As of Saturday, 1,344,079 acres of land have already burned in 2018, according to statistics from CAL FIRE and the National Forest Service, compared to 1,248,606 acres in 2017. In other words, there has been more fire damage in approximately three-quarters of 2018 than in the entirety of 2017. The National Interagency Coordination Center lists the potential of large-scale fire as “above normal” in about half of the regions of the state during October and November of 2018, so the number of total acres burned is likely to rise even higher. Remember that at the end of 2017, news reports were calling it the worst year on record — just as they do nearly every year. At this point, it feels futile to apply superlatives to wildfire seasons, because they will inevitably be topped. 
The causes of this seemingly endless rise are complicated. Fires are a natural part of every forest’s life cycle, clearing out dead wood and regenerating the soil. But as California became more densely inhabited, these essential smaller fires were often suppressed, leading to overgrown trees and brush. When drought conditions — exacerbated by climate change — began to grip the state, much of this biomass dried up, making forests into acres of kindling that can be set ablaze by lightning strikes, industrial fires and stray campfire sparks. Stimuli that decades earlier would have caused a small manageable fire now create the fast-moving infernos that the state dealt with over the summer. In many ways, wildfires make Californians of today pay for the mistakes of their forebears, like so many of the effects of climate change and industrialization. A certain amount of fire is inevitable, and at a certain point the only thing residents can do is try to prevent new fires and keep themselves safe.
Meanwhile, those tasked with protecting Californians, the Forest Service and local fire departments, have budgets that hardly cover the costs of dealing with this year’s fires, much less preventing next year’s. In early September, the state firefighting agency pleaded with legislators for an additional $234 million to make it to June of 2019, after spending $432 million in July and August alone. The request was granted, marking the eighth time in the last 10 years that the state has had to dip into budget reserves to fund firefighting efforts. Clearly, some major budget adjustments are in order for the coming years. 
In August, Gov. Jerry Brown called the state’s wildfires “the new normal that we have to face,” and I am inclined to agree with him. The sad truth is that there is not much an individual can do to prevent wildfires. An endless wildfire season may be the new normal, and the most that residents can do is support their fire departments, listen to evacuation orders and be careful with outside flame. Of course, every person should heed the mantra of Smokey the Bear, but the numbers show that California surpassed the “only you can prevent forest fires” era long ago.

Brockhampton released its fourth studio album “iridescence” on Friday. It is the group’s first album produced by RCA Records and without former member Ameer Vann. (Photo courtesy of RCA Records)
In just one year, Brockhampton went from a virtually unknown band to a critically acclaimed, highly influential group in contemporary music. Boasting incredible productions, phenomenal lyricism and a diverse set of voices and stories, Brockhampton has become an unstoppable force. When it was abruptly announced that one of the group’s founding members, Ameer Vann, was removed from the group earlier this year, fans and the group itself were left wondering how to recover from such a loss.
What resulted, however, was the highly experimental album “iridescence.” This project remains true to the connotations of a color-changing spectrum its name holds by offering a fresh perspective on  the world and an intimate look into minds of the individuals that make up Brockhampton. The album’s unorthodox production, the formerly-independent group’s first through a major label, is very industrial and cathartic, focusing largely on dissatisfaction with fame, loneliness, mental health and rebirth. 
The album opens with an intense track, “NEW ORLEANS,” in which the listener is introduced to the attitude and mentality the group now possesses. This is illustrated on the track several times, when vocalist Matt Champion raps, “Don’t like how they talking to me, why they walking to me?” referring to his new celebrity status and the negative byproducts of life in the public eye. This track sets the tone for the entire album, echoing the chaotic emotions through its overstimulated production style.
The second track, “THUG LIFE,” provides a seamless transition from the opener, representing the dichotomy of the entire project. Where the record’s sound was once angry and boastful, it is now calm, introspective and nostalgic. The first two songs see the group members going back and forth between overcompensating for their feelings through anger and indulging in their emotions. This two-sided sentiment is most prominent on tracks like “WHERE THE CASH AT,” an ode to wealth, and “TONYA,” which uses the story of Tonya Harding as a metaphor for a fall from fame.
The experimental production of “iridescence” marks somewhat of a rebirth for the group — a theme touched upon on tracks like “NEW ORLEANS” and “J’OUVERT.” Members Joba and Bearface stepped up to fill the holes left by Vann’s departure, with both of them recreating their styles and taking different approaches to their vocal delivery, especially on “BERLIN,” “THUG LIFE” and “WEIGHT.”
“WEIGHT,” is the strongest track on “iridescence,” encapsulating Brockhampton’s  indignant attitude. It dives headfirst into the demons each member faces, including issues regarding sexuality, self-harm, anxiety, paranoia and loneliness. The group speaks about using drugs and alcohol to suppress the demons produced by the limelight and the many new voices constantly scrutinizing them. Feelings of isolation are further explored on the album’s outro, “FABRIC,” on which Joba sings, “Don’t mind me I’m just killing time, but if you’ve got a lifeline throw it, throw it.” 
Although “iridescence” is a weaker effort than the “Saturation” trilogy, its redeeming qualities appear in the more stripped down, emotionally charged tracks. The abrasive production will surely disappoint many fans and listeners, but the group’s new approach is refreshing and clearly serves as a way for the members to work through the turbulent few months they endured prior to the album’s release. While not for everyone, “iridescence” is still a solid project.

Kali Uchis’ 23-show tour is her second, and supports her debut studio album “Isolation.” (Tomás Mier | Daily Trojan)
Nearly five months after the release of her debut album “Isolation,” Kali Uchis is still searching for her voice and identity as a young artist. On Friday night, the Colombian American singer performed at Shrine Expo Hall, a venue she filled with fans but not with her presence. 
To open the show, singer-songwriter Gabriel Garzón-Montano performed a medley of tracks that fit Uchis’ aesthetic as a performer — replete with sensual dancing and hearty vocals — but ultimately failed to keep the crowd energized. Following a 40-minute recess during which the audience became visibly restless, Uchis finally took the stage to rampant cheers and chants of her name. 
Accompanied by a flood of neon light, she launched into the opening notes of “Dead to Me,” one of the standout performances of the night. After opening with her strongest songs, “Tomorrow” and “Never Be Yours,” the remainder of Uchis’ set paled in comparison. 
Other high points came when she surprised her mostly Latinx crowd with a cover of hit Mexican song “Todos Me Miran,” a livelier and more upbeat track than her typical discography, and “Nuestro Planeta,” the sole Spanish-only track on her album.
Uchis admitted to the audience between songs: “For me personally, I’m just kind of an introverted person, I don’t like to talk to a lot of people.” 
This self-proclaimed timidness showed in her performance, as her interactions with the crowd were limited beyond a few obligatory remarks to express her gratitude. With her form-fitting leather skirt and bralette adorned with silver chains and bold makeup, there’s no denying Uchis’ visual presence. However, she falls flat in her ability to command the room as a performer.
To her credit, Uchis is a newcomer to the music scene and had only headlined one tour before “Isolation.” But her inexperience as a performer was evident on Friday night as her dance moves — consisting primarily of spins, shimmies and hip sways — quickly became repetitive and tired. The set would have benefited from more visually engaging movement on Uchis’ part or the addition of back up dancers. 
Regardless, the crowd adored Uchis as she performed her biggest hits, “Tyrant” and “After The Storm,” two tracks that would have served better as finales to her already-short set. Her powerful vocals and hypnotic sound remained captivating even though she failed to showcase her personality onstage. In fact, Uchis had the entire audience chanting for an encore, although she did not oblige. 
Despite her flat performance, the crowd’s consistently high energy and fervor was a testament to the strength of her fanbase. Hopefully, with time and practice, what Uchis is capable of doing in the studio will also come to fruition on stage.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Last Friday, Brockhampton released its fourth studio album, “iridescence,” and the Internet — specifically, my Twitter feed — lost its collective mind. 
I stumbled upon Brockhampton after a trusted friend insisted that I sample its “All-American Trash” mixtape a couple of years ago. The music didn’t blow me away, but the personalities behind the project left an impression on me. As a former fan of Odd Future, the notion of a hip-hop collective geared toward suburban audiences greatly appealed to me. The successive releases of the “Saturation” trilogy last year tapped into my inner fanboy in ways that I hadn’t felt about an emerging artist since I burnt myself out on Frank Ocean’s “Channel Orange” as a high school freshman. Since then, I’ve been a firm believer in the group, patiently waiting for the next chapter of its career to unfold.
“iridescence” comes in the midst of a largely eventful 2018 for the self-described boy band — from selling out tours to recording a documentary about its trials and tribulations to expelling a core member who was accused of sexual misconduct. 
I, like many, was shocked, appalled and deeply disappointed upon hearing about the allegations against Ameer Vann. Here was a young man on the brink of superstardom with a group of friends that pursued their dreams, and his own shameful history stripped him of that success. Vann was brutally honest about his dishonorable past in his music, and he showed a certain willingness to separate himself from that past over time. Yet, as a core member of a group that holds a strong stance against sexual assault and toxic masculinity, this kind of behavior was especially unacceptable, and he was rightfully dismissed soon afterward.
I was unsure how Brockhampton would recover and respond creatively to such an earth-shattering situation. The group shelved all of its initial follow-ups to the critically-acclaimed “Saturation” trilogy, including “Team Effort,” “Puppy” and “The Best Years of Our Lives.” It performed an especially emotional rendition of “TONYA” on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. It released a few singles, none of which picked up much traction among mainstream audiences. For a while, it was anyone’s guess as to when the next Brockhampton project would arrive and what it would look like without Vann, so the announcement earlier this month that “iridescence” was arriving on Friday reverberated within the band’s dedicated community of fans.
Admittedly, I am a passionate member of this community, and, for me, “iridescence” couldn’t come soon enough. Finally, after a brutal week of contentious midterms and deadlines, I walked out of work on Thursday night to the most pleasant of surprises — the arrival of “iridescence.”
Being as objective as a fanboy can, “iridescence” is absolutely incredible. Devoid of Brockhampton’s usual obvious singles or sticky choruses, the album is a perfect combination of experimentation and accessibility, and it captures the ups and downs that the band has undergone in the past year. 
The album, much like its creators, cannot be defined solely by its lyrics or melodies (which are already excellent); it is everything at once. It is an attitude, an aesthetic and an identity, and one cannot exist without the others. To truly enjoy Brockhampton is to believe in it and understand that its message extends far beyond their music.
For me, the most surreal part of its hasty ascension to the pinnacle of popular music has been its unprecedented appeal to young men. While Brockhampton is for everyone, the group has accomplished what few self-described boy bands have before in tapping into a previously untouched demographic of potential fans.

“iridescence” is the first of six albums slated to be released over the next three years as part of Brockhampton’s $15 million deal with RCA Records. In a true testament to the members’ belief in themselves as a collective, the proceeds of that deal were split evenly among the group. While many fans usually recoil in horror when their favorite artist signs with a major label, Brockhampton’s fandom, for the most part, understood that it was not a sellout for the group, but more the product of its tireless work ethic and high-quality output. And if “iridescence” is any indication, the next three years should spell nothing but victory for Brockhampton’s vibrant and diverse community of fans.

The Women of Troy remain undefeated as they claimed a 3-0 win Saturday against Washington.
The Trojans started the game on the front foot, creating a few chances within the first couple of minutes, but the Huskies quickly found their feet at McAlister Field and gave the Trojans a challenge for most of the first half. However, senior forward Leah Pruitt was still able to find the back of the net in the first half for her seventh goal of the season. It was a fantastic finish from the senior, who put the shot away in the bottom left-hand corner to give the Trojans a 1-0 lead.
The score stayed that way in the first half, even though the Huskies created chances to change it. Redshirt sophomore goalkeeper Kaylie Collins made a save for the Trojans to keep the lead with about 15 minutes left in the first half. Collins quickly dove to her right side from a shot hit from outside the box. That save proved to be a key play of the game, as it allowed the Trojans to maintain their 1-0 lead going into halftime.
“[Collins is] good and these games are the hardest because she’s not getting that many touches, she’s not getting called on that much,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “And to stay focused and to be able to respond and react in those moments is huge. It gives out team confidence and it does allow us to play aggressively with our defending. It does give us a chance to step up and press teams.”
In the second half, the Trojans came out firing and put two more goals, which came from the bench, past the Huskies to claim a 3-0 victory. Super sub and freshman forward Penelope Hocking scored the first goal of the second half and assisted the second to redshirt sophomore midfielder Daria Petredes, who has also contributed off the bench this season. The goals came in quick succession in the 65th and 66th minute, as the Trojans blew the Huskies away to finish both goals from close range.
“[Petredes], it’s been a long road for her,” McAlpine said. “Coming off injury and trying to come back to form, and not quite ever feeling good. She’s starting to feel good. You can see that in her play, you can see that in her energy.” He said that he can tell that her teammates respect the work she’s put in to her recovery. 
McAlpine has been fairly consistent with his starting lineup over the course of the season thus far, so some players may not have gotten as many minutes as they would have liked. However, players like Hocking and Petredes have made positive impacts on games while coming off the bench. Hocking already has 5 goals and four assists this season despite not starting a game. Meanwhile, Petredes has also changed games with her play coming off the bench. She creates space in the midfield which allows the team to have quick, positive movement in the front third of the field.
The Women of Troy will travel to Northern California this weekend as they prepare to face Cal on Thursday, and top-ranked Stanford on Sunday.

Every good season has its signature moments — sequences, calls, plays that go down in the history books. If USC football is to have a 2018 season to remember, then the left hand of redshirt freshman defensive lineman Jay Tufele will be responsible for not just Friday’s 39-36 win over Washington State, but also for one of those moments.
Who knows what would have happened had Christian Haangana — the Washington State redshirt sophomore left guard who fell while blocking for redshirt freshman punter Blake Mazza on the potential game-tying 38-yard field goal attempt — stayed upright, if Tufele hadn’t used all of his 6-foot-3 frame to deflect the kick, which would have otherwise split the uprights and forced overtime.
Consider what a loss would have meant: a 1-3 start for the second time in three years, except with a true freshman quarterback and no Sam Darnold waiting in the wings. It would have meant firing up the hot seat for members of the coaching staff — members like offensive coordinator Tee Martin, if not head coach Clay Helton himself. It would have justified the boobirds who came out at the Coliseum when USC went down after two scores in the second half despite holding a massive talent edge over Washington State.
For a week, those questions won’t be asked. And with USC’s next seven games coming against conference opponents, none of which are substantially better than Washington State, they may not be asked for a while.
Friday’s win was reminiscent of last season’s theme, when Darnold’s magic masked the team’s many issues. This time, it was the arm of freshman quarterback JT Daniels, the athleticism of freshman wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and redshirt sophomore wide receiver Tyler Vaughns and the speed of junior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. that bailed the Trojans out. 
One tell-tale sign that USC at no point had control of the game was the time of possession, which favored Washington State by more than 11 minutes. The Trojans never applied pressure to Cougar quarterback Gardner Minshew II, and on the other side of the line, didn’t give Daniels much time to operate. 
The run game was better than its woeful negative yardage performance in Texas, but what should be the bread-and-butter of this team was never established. Sophomore running back Stephen Carr, who exploded for 56 yards on the first two plays of the game, somehow only wound up with 77 yards on eight carries. 
Other problems still persisted. Minshew gashed the Trojans for 344 yards in the air, and the secondary, weakened by injury but still sporting a senior cornerback in Iman Marshall and a redshirt senior cornerback in Ajene Harris, did not look like it had a grip on coverage — three different Washington State receivers recorded six or more receptions. And there were the facepalming moments, like redshirt senior center Toa Lobendahn snapping the ball way over Daniels’ head for a 17-yard loss that ruined a promising drive in the second quarter.
Some of these issues are on the players. Others are on the coaching staff not putting the players in the right position to succeed. But none of them are because of talent, and this is a recurring point of discussion with this program. 
Very few high school football players raise their hands to willingly spend four years in Pullman, Wash. The recruits that Washington State lands are typically the ones who were turned down by big-time programs like USC, which literally has four- and five-star recruits begging for a roster spot year after year. Considering the talent disparity on the field on Friday, Washington State had no business hanging with USC, much less being a field goal away from tying the game late in regulation.
Still, the caveat: If the Trojans play the rest of the season the same way they did on Friday, they could easily wind up with an 8-1 conference record and a trip to the Pac-12 Championship. That’s how bad the Pac-12 is, and how poorly USC can play and still end up with an objectively good season. 
But this is only possible because of Tufele’s block, which came on a play call installed last week by special teams coach John Baxter. It was called “D-move,” according to Tufele, and it entailed going over the offensive guard if he leans forward. Prior to the kick, senior linebacker Cameron Smith noticed that Haangana was ready to lean forward, so he yelled out the play.
Haangana, indeed, leaned forward. Tufele, matched up across from him, didn’t. Haangana fell and watched as Tufele, unguarded, swatted the kick away.
“Right when I got in, it was just ‘one-two-three’ and I was up,” Tufele said outside the locker room after the game, speaking like a redshirt freshman in his first time in the spotlight. “I put my hands up and prayed the ball was going to hit it. I was like, ‘Game over. Checkmate.’”
A smart play call, solid communication, sublime execution and a depth player contributing in a big way: These are the traits of a good team. For all the problems that flared up, for all the griping and complaining that rightfully lands on the coaching staff week after week, everything came together perfectly for one critical moment on Friday. And that moment — it just might be the spark the Trojans need.
