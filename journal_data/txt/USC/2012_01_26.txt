The NFL Pro Bowl is scheduled for Sunday at 4 p.m., and USC Alumni will once again take the field. Three Trojans were selected to be part of the this year’s roster.

Green Bay linebacker Clay Matthews, Carolina center Ryan Kalil and Pittsburgh safety Troy Polamalu have been selected to compete among the elite.
Matthews and Kalil are set to start for the NFC, where they hope to beat the AFC for the second year in a row.
This season Matthews had 50 tackles, three forced fumbles and three interceptions that were key in the Packers’ success during the regular season. This is Matthews’ second Pro Bowl appearance. In 2010, he was the first Packers rookie to make it to the Pro Bowl since wide receiver James Lofton in 1978.
Kalil is making his third Pro Bowl appearance. His work in Carolina has been the centerpiece in the Panthers’ offensive line protecting their rookie quarterback Cam Newton. Both players are sure to display their talents Sunday.
Unfortunately, because of a calf injury, Polamalu will not start Sunday’s game against the NFC. Denver Broncos safety Brian Dawkins is set to take his place, according to NFL.com.
This is Polamalu’s seventh Pro Bowl and sixth start. This season Polamalu racked up 91 tackles and two interceptions.

The scene was all too familiar for the Women of Troy.
Four days after falling to Oregon State in a game that featured 25 lead changes and culminated in a narrow Beavers win in overtime, USC (10-8, 5-3) found itself in yet another tight basketball game that nearly went into overtime.
Instead, Colorado (15-4, 4-4) pieced together a final 5-2 push in the last minute to give the Buffaloes a 69-67 win at home. The loss leaves the Women of Troy in a two-game skid and keeps them at third in the Pac-12 standings.
Colorado guard Chucky Jeffery sank two free throws with four seconds remaining to give the Buffaloes the final lead. USC had a chance to answer, but turned over the ball to seal its fate.
With 48 seconds remaining and the game tied at 65 apiece, USC senior guard Briana Gilbreath found sophomore forward Cassie Harberts open for a layup to give the Women of Troy their last bucket and lead of the game.
Colorado forward Jen Reese responded with a jumper following a timeout by the Buffaloes. Harberts then turned it over, leading to Jeffery’s game-winning free throws.
Guard Brittany Wilson led the Buffaloes with 21 points alongside Jeffery’s 19. In the game, Colorado shot 44.1 percent from the field compared to USC’s 49.1 percent but held an eight free throw advantage over the Women of Troy.
USC had a balanced offensive attack led by junior forward Christina Marinacci with 17 and Gilbreath with 15, but several runs by the Buffaloes in the latter 20 minutes dispelled USC’s efforts.
Marinacci started off the second half with four consecutive baskets, stretching the Women of Troy’s lead to eight, before forcing Colorado to call a timeout.
She finally missed on her fifth attempt of the half, but not before scoring USC’s first 10 points after halftime. To counter her burst, the Buffaloes chained an 8-3 run to pull the game within a point.
After USC senior guard Ashley Corral assisted another bucket by Marinacci and a 3-pointer by sophomore forward Desireé Bradley to stretch the lead to six, Colorado went on a 7-0 run to pull ahead by one.
In the remaining 10 minutes, the teams traded leads eight times and tied twice before Colorado pulled away for the victory.
USC began the game shooting 55.6 percent in the first half, led by Gilbreath with 14 points on 6-for-8 shooting in the first 20 minutes. She cooled off in the second half, only scoring again on a free throw to finish with 15.
The last time the two sides met, USC defeated Colorado 87-70 in the Women’s National Invitation Tournament quarterfinals last March. Leading the Women of Troy was Corral, who made seven of her eight 3-pointers for a career-high 32 points.
This game, the Buffaloes shut her down, holding Corral to 2-for-8 shooting for seven points.
The Women of Troy will wrap up their two-game road trip and will try to end their skid on Saturday at 2 p.m. against the Utah Utes (9-10, 2-6), who hold the worst conference record in the Pac-12.

After two losses last weekend at No. 1 BYU, the USC Trojans men’s volleyball team is heading on another weekend road trip featuring consecutive matches against Mountain Pacific Sports Federation members UC Irvine and UC San Diego.
The pair of tight road losses against BYU — in four and five sets respectively — has shown the No. 5 Trojans (3-2, 2-2) a clear picture of their deficiencies as well as their strengths.

“It’s very easy to walk out of Provo with our heads held high,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “It’s great to know that our process is working. We’ll be good at the end of the season, but we’ll stub our toes early.”
Searching for more effective blocking and a more balanced offense, the Trojans have found the weekend schedule to be an advantage. Instead of bisecting the week with Wednesday and Friday matches, the new schedule allows them to focus practice time for both shoring up deficiencies from the previous week and preparing schematically for matches to come.
“Having the weekend matches early in the season gives us more time to practice,” Ferguson said. “It’s different than last year, but it’s working out for us.”
No. 2 UC Irvine has tremendous athleticism, depth and experience and is known especially for strength at the service line and a balanced, high-paced and precise attack.
“They don’t have one guy that carries them,” Ferguson said. “You have to be sound everywhere. We need to weather the storm at the service line from [outside hitter Jeremy] Dejno and [opposite Carson] Clark, find balance in our own offense and be sound blocking, or else they’ll expose us.”
On the defensive side, the Trojans will have to continue to have production from all three front-row blockers. If one of them lapses for even a split second, UCI has shown that it will attack those spaces with quick and precise offense.
“For a lot of teams, speed like Irvine’s is a big advantage because they just aren’t used to it,” said senior outside hitter and co-captain Tony Ciarelli. “But our offense is just as fast, if not faster, than theirs is, so the advantage is somewhat taken away.”
Clark is one of the nation’s elite players, with top-notch skills attacking, serving, blocking and defending. Ciarelli will be matched up against him.
“I need to show Carson [Clark] something different every time I go up to block,” Ciarelli said. “He’ll figure it out and take advantage of it if I don’t mix it up.”
The second match will be a mental check for the Trojans. UCSD is ranked at the bottom tier of the conference. Even though their ranking does not indicate a competitive match between the teams, Ferguson said the Trojans need to bring the same intensity and focus as they would against a top-ranked team.
“In the past, teams like that tend to give us trouble and sometimes we walk in there taking them lightly,” said senior middle blocker and co-captain Steven Shandrick. “But they’re just as important. We need to be mentally prepared. They’re going to give us their absolute best.”
First serve for both matches is at 7 p.m.

Coming off a weekend where Women of Troy defeated the 19th-ranked Wisconsin Badgers, the seventh-ranked women’s swimming team will be hosting the top-ranked Bears and eighth-ranked Cardinal at McDonald’s Stadium.
USC coach Dave Salo said that this weekend is as important as any to his team’s success.
Ready to go · The Women of Troy will face their toughest competition of the season this weekend. Both Cal and Stanford are ranked in top 10. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan
“[California and Stanford mark] the beginning of the championship season for us,” Salo said. “These meets will test our mettle to see if we have what it takes to finish off the NCAA championship meet among the top five.”
USC Senior Katinka Hosszu is the national leader in the 200-yard fly and and 400-yard individual medley. Hosszu was named the national swimmer of the year in 2011 and broke several school records. Joining Hosszu will be junior Haley Anderson, who is among the NCAA leaders in several freestyle events, sophomore Kasey Carlson, who has posted NCAA qualifying times in the 100- and 200- yard breaststroke, and senior Tanya Krisman, who is ranked seventh  in the 200 yard fly.
Cal and Stanford feature several of the nation’s best swimmers. Cal has the nation’s leader in the 200 yard breaststroke in Caitlin Leverenz, while Stanford features Sam Woodward, who is among the nation’s leaders in the 100-yard fly and 50-yard freestyle. Cal won the NCAA championship last season.
Salo said that although he is confident he knows that beating the bay area teams will be tough.
“We are a better championship meet team because we don’t have the depth [they do],” Salo said. “To win either of the meets we will need to score wins in most of the events.”
Though the women’s teams will be taking to the pool this weekend, the men have a break from action. They will face Cal and Stanford the following weekend.
The contests against Cal and Stanford start the home stretch for USC, as the Pac-12 championship begins Feb. 22, followed by the NCAA championships, which begin in March. The meet with Cal is Friday at 2 p.m., and the meet against Stanford is Saturday at noon.

The injuries are piling up, the losses are piling up, and the story gets older day by day. It’s a story that’s been told before. It’s a truth that’s been exacerbated over the last couple of weeks. The USC men’s basketball team is just not good. The team has struggled mightily this season.
And whenever I think the season can’t get any worse, it does.
USC’s big rivalry game against UCLA at the Galen Center ended in a 19-point drubbing at home in front of a season-high crowd of 8,474.
The team has lost multiple players to injuries. First, it was redshirt sophomore forward Curtis Washington (shoulder) and senior guard Jio Fontan (knee) in the preseason. Then, redshirt sophomore forward Evan Smith (shoulder) in mid-December and now redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller (shoulder). Fontan was the team’s leading scorer last year. Fuller ranks second on the team in scoring and leads the team in rebounding this season.
Currently, the Trojans are mired in a nine-game losing streak, their worst losing streak in more than 20 years. They have lost 14 of their last 15 games. Their last home win came more than a month ago while many of us were enjoying winter break. Their last road win came more than three months ago during Thanksgiving break.
It isn’t time to label this season an overall failure, though.
For 19- and 20-year old young adults to play through these circumstances signifies unwavering strength. USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s ability to power through while critics hit him left and right is admirable. He’s working with the hand he was dealt, and the rest of his coaching staff has been faithfully at his side.
Not many collegiate programs would be able to compete on a nightly basis if dealt the same situation. O’Neill and his staff have done what they can.
No matter how hard it is to look past the glaring negatives, the season has elicited bright spots here and there. They might be few and far between, but they’re there.
Defensively as a unit, USC has held its opponents to just 58 points per contest, good for 14th in the nation. The Trojans began the season holding their first 19 opponents to 66 points or less, which hadn’t happened since the 1948 season when that USC squad kept all its opponents under that mark.
Offensively, it might be hard to tell, but the progress is there individually. Redshirt Sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon notched a career-high 18 points last week in a narrow three-point loss at Oregon. Freshman guard Byron Wesley similarly recorded a career-high 15 points at Oregon State.
I don’t care what shows up in the box score on a night-to-night basis, though, and I don’t care what the statistics say. Any lofty expectations should be forgotten. Fans, alumni and students should admire this team for who they are outside of the win and loss column.
This season isn’t going to change drastically. The team isn’t going to suddenly get infinitely better overnight. To keep thinking of what could have been if this or that happened isn’t going to change anything, either.
Sure, it’s been a trying season, but taking away nothing would be for naught. If anything, this team has taught us a valuable lesson, and it’s what embodies the Trojan spirit.
As always — no matter the circumstances — Trojans fight on

Whatever chance the USC men’s basketball team had at notching its first Pac-12 win of the season Thursday against Colorado took a serious hit less than five minutes into the contest.
Another one bites the dust · Sophomore guard Maurice Jones scored 13 points Thursday but shot 4-15 from the field. The Trojans have yet to win a conference game and will face Utah Saturday at home. - Daily Trojan file photo
On a drive to the basket, sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon’s knee collided with an opposing defender, causing the 7-footer to fall to the floor in pain.
Dedmon would not return to the court and was later diagnosed with a sprained knee, leaving USC (5-16, 0-8) with just six available scholarship players.
With an alarming lack of depth, the Trojans were essentially hopeless against visiting Colorado (14-6, 6-2), which ran off 37 first-half points en route to a 74-50 victory in front of an announced crowd of 3,147 at the Galen Center.
“All this injury stuff has caught up to us,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “Without Dewayne in there, we’re just outmanned. We’re playing two walk-ons in our rotation. Every player on our team is playing more minutes than they can handle right now.”
The Trojans, whose last win came on Dec. 19 against Texas Christian, were in a hole early, as the Buffaloes opened the game on a 7-0 run. Their first point didn’t come until Dedmon knocked down a free throw about three minutes into the opening half.
USC shot just 33 percent from the field over the first 20 minutes of action, while Colorado put up a solid 12-of-24 shooting performance, including 4-for-8 from 3-point range, en route to an 11-point lead at the break.
That lead would only balloon in the second half.
“Colorado is a good basketball team,” O’Neill said. “They have vets. They have depth and they deserve to win.”
Five players would finish with double-figure point totals for the Buffaloes.
With Dedmon on the bench wearing a brace on his knee for the remainder of the game, the Trojans never got going on offense, as they registered 24 points over the course of the final 20 minutes. Collectively, they shot 32 percent from the field for the entire game.
“Sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it doesn’t,” O’Neill said. “We don’t have a junior, senior class to anchor the team and we don’t have the kind of depth to sustain the kind of injuries we’ve had.”
Most of the scoring that did occur derived largely from sophomore guard Maurice Jones and freshman Byron Wesley, who finished with 13 and 12 points, respectively. It marked the second consecutive game Wesley finished in double figures.
“Byron’s going to be a really, really good player,” O’Neill said. “I don’t have any question about it. He’s playing the four spot and playing 40 minutes. He’s playing hard.”
Unfortunately for Jones and Wesley, they don’t have much help left, as Dedmon became the latest player to be sidelined with an injury.
“We just have to figure out how everybody can step up and do different things to help fill the void,” Dedmon said.
Though the status of the sophomore forward, who is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Friday, is unknown, four players have already been sidelined with season-ending injuries in senior guard Jio Fontan, redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller, sophomore forward Curtis Washington and redshirt sophomore forward Evan Smith.
“We’re pinned,” O’Neill said. “There are no moves right now. There’s no quick fix. We’re adding a ton of players next year and have a ton of guys returning.”
But there are still 10 games left in conference play this season, and on Saturday, the Trojans host Utah in what might prove to be their best chance to grab a win in conference play.
The Utes (5-15, 2-6), who earlier in the season registered an eight-game losing streak of their own, have yet to win a game on the road this season and recently dismissed their leading scorer, senior guard Josh Watkins. Watkins had been averaging 15.6 points and 4.8 assists on the season.
Tip-off at the Galen Center is set for 8 p.m. and will be televised on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.

Local stakeholders urged expansion of the USC Master Plan to include beautification plans for the area west of Vermont Avenue at a meeting for the North Area Neighborhood Development Council on Thursday.
Local voices · North Area Neighborhood Development Council safety chair and area representative Leslie Evans addresses concerns of those attending the meeting. - Woodrow Clark | Daily Trojan
About 15 residents and activists gathered in a multipurpose room at the University Village to hear presentations from the council’s leadership about local issues, ranging from public safety to re-districting.
NANDC President Shawn Simons said she was told at USC’s open houses that the university’s plan for beautifying the community would not extend past Vermont Avenue.
“When they say we need the community to shop here, they are talking about all of you west of Vermont,” Simons said. “But when they say they are going to do a community beautification, they are not talking about west of Vermont.”
Simons, who sits on a Master Plan advisory board and communicates regularly with USC officials, said the university has been fairly receptive.
“They seem fairly open to this right now,” Simons said. “We are not asking for a lot.”
Simons said that though the Master Plan will likely reap many benefits for the community west of Vermont Avenue, she believes the university should expand its beautification since the school’s influence spans past Vermont.
USC currently operates several programs past Vermont Avenue, including a faculty and staff housing program and yellow jacket security patrols, Simons said.
Charlene Limenih, a resident two blocks west of Vermont Avenue, said she feels the university’s presence because many students live in the area.
“I am definitely for USC looking beyond Vermont,” Limenih said. “They should look at least to Normandie [Avenue] because we have students in that area.”
Limenih, who has found whiskey bottles and condoms in her yard after parties, said the school could improve on how they educate off-campus residents about respect and responsibility.
“We care about USC,” Limenih said. “It is nice for us … but I want them to look at me as somebody too. We count.”
Simons said the Master Plan means USC might improve nearby parks, but the system for allocating funds for this project needs to be improved.
“Something we are pushing for is creating a structure for how the community accesses this money and decides to use this money,” Simons said.
At the moment, Simons said, USC is communicating with city council member Bernard C. Parks’ office about the needs of the community.
“USC is being told by the council district what we want,” Simons said. “It really should be our voice.”
Simons encouraged the audience to stay up to date about the process as it progresses in the coming months.
“I don’t know that we necessarily have to be freaked out … but we need to be knowledgeable about what’s happening,” Simons said.
I drink whiskey but I don’t use condoms so it isn’t me

California Sen. Alex Padilla is scheduled to speak with students at USC today on various issues facing the state, such as immigration reform, education budget cuts and sustainability.
He is scheduled to appear in the  Rosen Family Theatre of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center at noon.
The chat is part of the Latino Empowerment Speakers Series, which will bring a dozen high-ranking politicians and city officials to campus for fireside chats with students.
Event organizer Juan Espinoza, director of political affairs for the Latina/o Student Assembly, said the event is for all students, not just Latinos.
“Senator Padilla is one of the most influential leaders in our state,” Espinoza said.  “I want to know his plans to counter Governor Jerry Brown’s recent proposal to cut Cal Grants in half for students at private universities.”
Brown announced his proposal earlier in the week, but Padilla said he was unaware of it.
“I didn’t hear about that,” Padilla said. “I guess I better take a look at that before [I go].”
Padilla is currently on a committee that oversees California’s education budget. At the age of 28, Padilla was one of the youngest presidents of the Los Angeles City Council, as well as the first Latino to lead the council since 1868.
Padilla said the number of Latino government representatives has soared in California compared to what it was when he first started working in government, but he said there is still much to be done.
“Just increasing the number of Latino government officials will not change the world,” Padilla said. “USC is an elite institution full of quality students who can make a difference. I look forward to hearing what they have to say.”
Padilla will soon become one of the many politicians that have come to USC to discuss pressing governmental issues with students. Last October, President Barack Obama along with U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, now-Gov. Jerry Brown and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa spoke on campus to rally support for the democratic platform.
Dan Schnur, the executive director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said the Latino Empowerment Speaker Series is a completely different event.
“It’s one thing for students to listen to some of the most prestigious politicians and high-ranking officials in the state, but when students get to interact with the speaker and talk with them — that’s what makes this an incredible opportunity,” Schnur said.
Efe Ozturk, a senior majoring in biological sciences, said it is important for students to interact with politicians and to voice their grievances.
“Events like these expose students to those politicians guiding the country,” he said. “This gives us a chance to speak out about obstacles that affect us all.”
Bill Ramos, a senior majoring in communication, said he is attending Padilla’s chat,  to seek inspiration and personal guidance.
“Padilla has had much success as a Latino politician and he inspires me to make a positive difference in my community,” Ramos said. “I want to be a role model for my siblings and show them how I graduated college. I want to make everyone proud.”
Aubrey Garcia, a senior majoring in communication and public relations, said events like these are vital for students to expand their bubble.
“As students, we need to realize that there is so much more going on around us than what we see on campus,” Garcia said. “It’s essential for USC to have events with politicians since they make decisions that affect us.”

King Hall will be home to a new residential dining facility opening this summer that will replace the current Café 84 retail-dining complex.
The new facility, which will join The Parkside Restaurant and EVK Restaurant and Grill as the main residential dining halls on campus, will follow the all-you-can-eat model of EVK and Parkside and have a greater focus on healthier foods, according to Director of USC Hospitality Kris Klinger.
Fresh food · Jordan Rees, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, and Malie Collins, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, dine in King Hall. Café 84 is scheduled to become a residential dining hall facility with an all-you-can-eat buffet and swipe-in meals. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
Klinger said that USC Hospitality has been looking at places like Whole Foods as a model for the new dining hall in terms of food and design.
“We are looking to create a Whole Foods-type model where it’s got the look and feel of a Whole Foods environment with a really unique salad bar and a lot of made-to-order food as well as some areas where you can get your own hot food,” Klinger said.
The shift toward healthier food in King Hall is part of an overall change among all residential dining facilities to emphasize health and nutrition, while still providing a wide variety of meal options.
Nick Pachon, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, said the healthy food options will be a good addition to USC dining halls.
“A lot of the time when I go to EVK, I’m just choosing between pizza and chicken nuggets or something,” Pachon said. “Healthy food as some of the choices would be a nice change.”
Klinger said menu changes will take place gradually so healthier options can be served alongside student favorites like pizza.
Some structural elements of the current Café 84 will be retained through the transition to a residential dining hall, but all retail branding and signage will be removed.
Plans for the new facility are beginning to take shape with basic blueprints in place, but Klinger said the current plans have the project over-budget, and changes are being made to manage costs. Hospitality will be working with student focus groups to continue making changes to the design and menu options.
The renovations will not result in increased prices for meals at the residential dining facilities, although Klinger said the cost of providing healthier food might rise.
“Food keeps getting more expensive, especially good food,” Klinger said. “Thierry [Bourroux, associate director of residential operations for USC Hospitality] has got the chefs cooking good food, but that can be costly so we’re looking for ways to partner with different groups.”
The changes to King Hall will accompany the transition of neighboring Webb Tower to a residential college, which will house freshmen.
“It will totally change the landscape of residential dining for freshmen,” Klinger said. “We’re trying to significantly raise the bar.”
Some students, however, are not convinced of the need for removing Café 84 to create residential dining.
Trenton Ramos, a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering, lives in Cardinal Gardens and says he eats at Café 84 frequently.
“It’s so much closer than the campus center, and I can still use my dining dollars here,” Ramos said. “I like being able to choose between everything that’s here. If it was a dining hall like EVK, I don’t think I would come here as often.”
In addition to the changes to King Hall, EVK will be undergoing renovations this summer. Klinger and Bourroux said the facilities will emulate some of the aspects of the True Food Kitchen, a full-service restaurant chain built around the concept of healthy, good-tasting and commercially viable food made with locally grown ingredients.
“It’s a focus on food and the presentation of food and having open space and micro-areas where people can sit and enjoy their meal,” Klinger said.
Cafe 84 has the nicest variety of dining on campus along with a salad bar. They really need a salad bar or healthy options at the ronald tutor campus center, not on the outer edges of campus :(
Bravo, USC Hospitality!  This is a great step towards improving USC Residential Dining (which, I think many would agree, desperately needs improvement).

On Tuesday, President Barack Obama used his State of the Union address to remind the public of the merits of the hands-on approach to economics. But he failed to address the economy’s most pressing issue: $15-trillion in federal debt.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
If the plans put forth in Obama’s address are approved, we will have to face this debt long after earning our degrees — something that should cause us to think twice about voting for him in the presidential election.
Obama’s decision to make the economy the focal point of his address came in the middle of a barrage of Republican pro-free-market rhetoric. The ideological debate between the warring political factions must result in the victory of the Republican Party’s free-market principles.
After three years as president, Obama is still struggling with the economy. It is clear that the government needs to take a different approach to the economy if the country is to return to prosperity. The stakes are especially high for college students, who will face the aftermath of the upcoming presidential election as undergraduates and new entrants to the workforce.
The president outlined a long-term fix to the economy, but his strategy will not result in any benefits until he leaves office.
Though Obama called for an end to excessive outsourcing by American businesses, he also put forth the merits of a heavily involved government, which initially led to the problem. The best way to prevent outsourcing in the first place is to get the government out of the way and allow businesses to struggle and thrive on their own.
He emphasized a reformed tax code that runs by the “Buffett Rule,” which would ensure that any individual earning more than $1 million a year pays at least 30 percent of his or her income in taxes.
Though some of the president’s points were valid and his suggestions are honorable, his methods for addressing America’s ludicrous debt show he is missing the point. Instead of spending more on job training programs and slapping higher income tax rates on the wealthy, the government should simply spend less. When a country is in this much debt, the first thing it must do is cut all unnecessary expenditures, not tack on more to the federal budget.
Obama’s call for a return to “American values” is misleading. Ripping off the rich for the sake of the less wealthy while spending taxpayers’ hard-earned money on questionable foreign entanglements cannot be an American value. Americans that work hard and earn their wealth should not be penalized for their innovation, ingenuity or diligence.
As future hard-working Americans, we must remember that the government will someday want to take our money. By choosing an economic strategy that cuts the government’s frivolous spending and allows for a more independent private sector, we can expect to see much more substantial and lasting change. Otherwise, we can only expect to be hit even harder after graduation.

Obama, members of Congress, and the big wigs on Wall Street who get these people into office, are clearly in it for themselves.  The rest of us have to fight over the crumbs that they so graciously give us.  There is so much hypocrisy, hyperbole, and insincerity from our “leaders” and those fighting to become the next leaders, that we have become desensitized to the nonsense.  We accept what they offer as truth and question nothing.  We point fingers at the other party as if they are to blame when in fact, they are the same.  Pitching a tent in front of city hall is not the answer.  Pitching these guys on their asses and electing “true” representatives of the people is the answer.  Alas, not a single candidate running for President fits this bill. I guess the good guys and gals are not attracted to run for elected office.
Typical freshman dribble…OBAMA may be  well intentioned but he is a complete incompetent with respect to the economy. Wait till you need to find a job or are considerd rich when trying to support a family in socal on 250k. Problem is, he has never had a job, made payroll or lived the life of the 99pct. He is and his wife are the ultimate “*afirmative action” president. While I personally don’t care for him, a non afirmative action guy like Gingrich will tear Obummer apart. Government should stay out of BOTH religion and the economy. Something for you brainwashed liberals, the number of federal limosines has roughly doubled since bush from 197 to almost 400 (recent gao report). Imperial. Presidency anyone? Both. Democrats and Republicans are for bigger govt, higher taxes and more control of your life. Socilaism is slavery, capitalism is freedom. Think about it.
While I agree with most of what you wrote, Gingrich is the ultimate hypocrite on so many levels, so how would be any better than Obama as President?  I am a lifelong Republican and I am not happy with anyone on the slate.  In fact, I am not happy with my party either as it espouses to cut spending while waging unfunded trillion dollar wars and bank bailouts.  Let’s face it, the two party system that we have is broken and playing the name game is a red herring that comes from those who want to divide and conquer us.  Think about it.
Very good synopsis of what should be of prime concern for the citizens of this country.  Nice write-up, Sarah.

Millions who watched President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address Tuesday night went to bed with a reminder of the “American promise”: Hard work can guarantee the means to support oneself and one’s family.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
This ideal resonates most powerfully with college students. We have our feet poised on the bottom rung of the life ladder; we have everything to lose and everything to gain. Accordingly, the economic plan announced Tuesday correlates strongly with student interests.
Obama proposes an economy “where hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded.” Well, we’ve worked hard. We’ve been responsible. We’ve attended to our education. Where’s our payoff?
It starts with cultivating a healthier economy for us to enter in the first place. Cognizant of the growing gap between America’s rich and poor, Obama hopes to create a strong middle class by focusing tax relief on the 98 percent of Americans who make under $250,000 a year.
The plan is simple. Pass a payroll tax cut. Implement the so-called “Buffett Rule” by keeping tax rates for millionaires at a minimum of 30 percent and by ensuring no secretary has a higher tax rate than his or her far wealthier boss. Instead of bailouts, create a financial crimes unit to investigate and bring to right the big banks that misuse people’s investments.
Obama wants to bolster American manufacturing by cutting taxes for manufacturers. Companies that outsource jobs will be denied tax breaks. Instead, the breaks will be awarded to businesses trying to bring jobs home.
Such measures would create an influx of employment opportunities for fresh college graduates and reduce the risk of layoffs because of outsourcing.
Obama’s recognition of the vital link between an educated America and a prosperous America offers students an even more direct benefit. In his address, Obama called for an extension of the tuition tax credit and a commitment from states to make post-secondary education a higher priority in their budgets.
Obama challenged colleges to find innovative ways to keep tuition down and federal funding up.
Obama’s proposals aim to build a strong, fair economy on the back of a well-educated populace. His strategies will treat students well.
Funding for education and other government initiatives will not come from vulnerable targets like seniors, middle-class citizens or college graduates working entry-level positions. Instead, the financial institutions perpetrating the evils of “outsourcing, bad debt and phony financial profit” should pick up the slack. The wealthy have a duty to help — not because they haven’t worked hard, but because they have far more to spare than many middle-class citizens who have labored with equal intensity.
As for us college students, we will be left free to take a stab at capturing the American dream.

Is it viable?
The author of this article didn’t even attempt to answer the question.
If President Barak Obama is so convinced that taxes are too high for manufacturers, why raise anyone’s taxes? Is this not making manufacturers more equal than other companies and individual taxpayers? Why should the some businesses (banks, professional service, raw material extractors, retail outlets, …) and individuals pay higher rates than manufacturers? If low taxes are good for one, they are good for all. 47% of individuals pay 0% in income taxes and many get “refunds” for a net negative income tax. If President Barak Obama is consistent, he should work to bring down EVERY income tax rate closer to ZERO.

James Franco’s new web series “Undergrads,” which the video says will air Thursday at 8 p.m. on www.jamesfrancotv.com, follows the lives of several USC  students.
In an interview with MTV, Dave Franco, James Franco’s brother, said he helped film, direct and produce the web series.
Undergrads · "Undergrads," actor James Franco's new web series, shows the lives of college students. In this screenshot from the trailer, USC students tailgate on McCarthy Quad. - JamesFrancoTV.com
“This past semester, I was working more behind the camera, and I directed, produced and wrote this Web series about college life,” Dave Franco told MTV. ” We figured, ‘[College] is crazy enough as it is; let’s just show what’s really going on.’ So we followed a handful of kids at USC throughout the semester, and the whole tone is a little strange, because it’s part documentary, part reality, part scripted.”
The trailer for the web series shows students playing Twister at a tailgate in McCarthy Quad, discussing “cuddling,” pouring beer on each other and taking shots with high-five chasers.
Dave Franco said the web series, which he hopes will grab the attention of FX, Showtime or HBO, accurately portrays life at USC.
“I went to USC, and watching this footage, I can attest that this is really what it’s like. This is what happens on a typical night,” Dave Franco told MTV.
As of publication, Dave Franco was unavailable for comment.
Michael L. Jackson, USC vice president for student affairs, released the following statement today in response to a preview of the show.
 
“The University of Southern California does not endorse nor did it authorize the web series ‘Undergrads.’
The scenes in the series trailer could have been filmed on many college campuses. More accurately representative of USC are the students who provide hundreds of hours in community service, who rank among the country’s most academically and artistically gifted, and who value diversity in cultures, nationalities and socio-economic backgrounds among their peers.”
 

James Franco on WhoSay
look, as my name says, i’m an alum.  the truth is that usc is a playground for very wealthy white kids.  drunken parties, obsessive football worship, and an almost cult-like culture is pervasive.  not to mention an undertone of entitlement.  there’s a fortress around the school for gods’ sake!!!!   the popular image of usc IS what the school’s about.  period.  accept this reality and actively work to change it (and accepting anybody with a high SAT score and wealthy zipcode isn’t gonna do that).   DIVERSIFY the campus!  tear down the wall that separates the campus from the surrounding community!  stop burying your heads in the sand.
Pretty sure this was not a smear campaign for USC but an opportunity seen by these 3 USC actors to try and take advantage of an opportunity co-signed by a famous actor (James Franco) so they could pad their resume with something.  I dont think any of the 3 cared how it would affect USC, their alma mater, at any point during the filming and certainly nobody looking for a break in showbiz would really care either to be quite honest.  These 3 actors/students im sure are hoping this is part of their break when in reality this will likely be the last we hear of them
It’s amazing that just a “select” few were chosen to represent an incredible university and amazingly talented and intuitive student body.  May I assure the readers, that these few are not in any way a representation of the majority of students attending USC.  Not surprising though, that if these few weren’t smart enough to better represent the university they weren’t smart enough to figure out the true intention of an UCLA alumnus and his brother.
What an annoying web series that makes our school look bad. If we want to become a truly elite university, we need to get rid of these stereotypes. Like someone has already said, this represents GREEK life at USC, which is just 20-25% of the school. Hope the administration can do something about it. Releasing a statement is simply not enough.
This is all kinds of dumb. And not at all reflective of the 20,000 undergrads who go to the school, myself included.
This accurately reflects GREEK life at USC, not the school as a whole.
Yes! This is perfect.
This series is seriously damaging to the image of our school. Good job Dave Franco in your contributions to your alma mater. It might discourage talented, academically-oriented students from USC. Whereas negative things that are spread by word of mouth can be dismissed as rumors, people treat what they see in video footage as truth. I support calls for a petition against this series.

Liam Neeson is Hollywood’s resident badass. From Unknown, where he dominated a group of Russian spies, to Taken, where he destroyed an entire coalition of Serbian sex traffickers, it is generally accepted that he who crosses the path of Liam Neeson does not come out alive.
Bad ass · The role of Ottway, a suicidal widower forced to fend for himself in the Alaskan wilderness against an aggressive pack of wolves in writer and director Joe Carnahan’s latest film, was originally meant to be played by a younger actor, but Liam Neeson’s maturity, emotional depth, gritty reputation and popularity as a leading action star landed him the esteemed part. - Photo courtesy of EPK.TV
Unless, that is, Neeson’s adversaries are not human but rather wolves perhaps?
Cue Neeson’s newest film, The Grey. Directed by Joe Carnahan (The A-Team, Pride and Glory), The Grey tells the story of an unruly group of oil rig roughnecks who, after surviving a plane crash, find themselves stranded in a desolate expanse of the frigid Alaskan tundra. As if their plight weren’t trying enough, they quickly become the new targets of a ruthless pack of monstrously large and vicious wolves intent on picking off the men one by one until they are no longer encroaching upon the wolves’ territory.
Carnahan believes this film is undoubtedly his greatest work. He speaks about it as if it’s his own child, infused with a life, spirit and personality. Though he admits that the advertised hardcore action and idea of Neeson fighting wolves is likely what will draw many people to see the film, he assures that there is more to the story.
“The emotional content is much more important to me than the action,” Carnahan said. “It is a film about [nature and beauty] and how for all of its beauty, there are equal parts hostility, which is where the wolves and the cold and the water and the cliffs come into play.”
Shot in remote Smithers, Canada, the actors and crew had to deal with excruciatingly cold conditions, making their portrayals of the freezing temperatures in the film not that far from the truth.
“We got out of the plane, and it was 35 degrees below zero. I think it actually worked to our advantage,” said Frank Grillo, the actor playing the role of Diaz, one of the oil rig survivors in the film. “We didn’t have to make-believe we were cold. After the first week, we got used to it, and it was actually kind of fun.”
Even Neeson, a native of Ireland and no stranger to chilly weather, had some complaints about the horrendous conditions.
“It was so cold that the cameras were malfunctioning and equipment wasn’t working,” Neeson said. “Absolutely ludicrous.”
Despite the unsavory conditions, it didn’t take long for the actors to fall in love with the script, the characters and the entire experience.
“It was like being a little kid and playing cops and robbers,” said Grillo, whose surly, brash character marks a sharp distinction from the kind, friendly roles he usually plays. “I always play bubbly guys, but it was really fun to play the villain and just be really nasty and mean all the time.”
Neeson, starring as the tough yet internally troubled group leader Ottway, was a far cry from the initial “30-something-young-guy” actor Carnahan initially envisioned in the role.
But Neeson’s maturity ended up being paramount to the role, especially in the opening two minutes of the film when Ottway nearly commits suicide.
“I always envisioned a younger actor in the role of Ottway, but a lot of the young guys we tested just couldn’t really conceive of being willing to end their lives at 30,” Carnahan said.  “But now I can’t even conceive of anyone other than Liam playing the role because he’s so brilliant and spot on.”
Neeson, who admits to “genuinely falling in love with the film” after his initial read, expressed a special attachment to the story.
“The script read like a 19th-century epic poem,” Neeson said. “It was just beautiful.”
Though he is no stranger to playing a super-masculine, dominant character, Neeson, whose towering stature sharply contradicts his calm demeanor, admits that this alpha-male prototype is completely unnatural for him.
“I’m so not a leader,” Neeson said. “I can play a leader though.”
Despite the action-oriented draw of the film, the actors and director all agree the film is not intended to merely entertain, but to tap into emotional life issues that are not often dealt with in the mundane, everyday world.
“The film speaks to the truth that men truly are as afraid as when they were children,” actor Grillo said. “It’s tough being a man. How do you define yourself? What is fear? What do you believe in? What are you willing to do to survive and live and protect your family? How far will I go before I quit?”
The film not only proposes questions regarding beliefs, morality and family, but also speaks to the value of life.
“The basic thesis of the film is that as important as it is how you live, it is equally important how you die,” Carnahan said. “My only hope for the film is that it plays beyond the two hours that it took to watch it.”
It’s always a treat reading your work and I’ve always enjoyed your writing Madame Baurdine.  This article in particular however has one mistake. In the movie Taken, Neeson he deals with Albanian sex traffickers.  I have no doubt that you meant no harm by it but it would be greatly appreciated if you corrected the error.
Thank you,
-Milan-

For every great artist, there’s often a greater songwriter at work behind the scenes.
That’s because a significant amount of artists, many of them mainstream, show up to sing their songs and build their brands but do not compose the material.
In the rap and rock worlds, not writing one’s own material is more unusual. Artists in these genres pride themselves on their creativity, which is why many of them take a two-year break on average in between record releases.
Rapper Eminem, for example, writes all of his own lyrics and contributes to beats for his songs. Meanwhile, rock band U2 has always written its own lyrics, in addition to composing all of its musical arrangements.
When it comes to rap and rock, people seem to value genuine creativity and emotion, which is why it is important for these artists to write their own material.
Of course, there will always be exceptions to the rule.
The Strokes is just one band that has a hired writer — JP Bowersock. Since he is acknowledged in their record sleeves, Bowersock is what the industry calls a professional songwriter. Still, other artists employ “ghostwriters” instead.
A ghostwriter is essentially the same as a professional writer, except the ghostwriter is paid a premium price to never receive any credit for the work he does. For the most part, labels hire ghostwriters to try to drive sales for smaller artists that the label thinks have the potential to make it big.
Labels do not want to advertise that a band receives assistance because it might tarnish a group’s “hard-working” image. At the same time, labels want to help a band hit its stride and be more radio-friendly, which is why hiring an experienced, hit-making ghostwriter is such an appealing option.
The world of mainstream music, however, is where hired songwriters are most prevalent, as no listeners really seem to have a problem with it.
Rihanna is a wildly successful pop superstar whose singles consistently find their way to the top of the charts. From her debut hit “Pon de Replay” to recent chart toppers such as “We Found Love,” she has managed to establish herself as both a household name and Grammy-winner along the way.
But she has not written any of her songs — not a single one in her entire catalogue.
Rihanna and her record label, Def Jam, have employed a vast amount of professional writers to aid the singer in her quest for stardom.
Sure, she supplies the voice, but her writing team — which includes Jay-Z, Dr. Luke and Makeba Riddick — is the creative force that actually gives her something to sing about.
But Rihanna is the only one who gets the fame and recognition. The writers merely sit back and figure out how to keep her in the limelight with the next song.
It’s just like with Hollywood: Writers and producers sit back and brainstorm on projects while actors sit in the spotlight waiting for the next interesting idea to come along. A movie is nothing without a good plot or script, much like a song is nothing without a good arrangement or melody. Yet time after time, movie studios market actors more than they market actual plots and creative teams, just as record labels market individual artists rather than their writers.
Thanks to branding, artists can be both adored or detested for how they’re marketed. Some enjoy the brand, and others do not. And because of branding, many artists have to play it safe and stay true to their genre. It is rare, although not unheard of, for artists to abandon one scheme for another.
So far, only a few artists have been daring enough to do so. When it does happen, it polarizes fan bases. Just ask Linkin Park, who dropped its nu-metal sound in favor of a mashup of arena- and pop-rock that alienated many old fans while also managing to draw in thousands of new ones.
Because of these risks, some artists turn to writing songs for other musicians if they want to experiment and flex their creative muscles. Jay-Z has interests outside of rap, which is why he writes for Rihanna. Similarly, Katy Perry showed her country twang when she penned “Bullet” for singer Jessie James in 2009.
The bottom line is that the music industry is a place where many things tend to happen behind the scenes.
So the next time Rihanna’s “We Found Love” plays on a radio station, remember: It probably wasn’t her who found love in a hopeless place.
 
Nick Mindicino is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. His column “Industry Ballads” runs Fridays. 
You need to learn how to cite. The entire article felt like you were just saying things.
As a fan of The Strokes, I don’t see anything wrong with the writer’s statement. He never said that they didn’t write their own songs. Just look at the differences in how he described Rihanna (who doesn’t write anything) and The Strokes (who have a songwriter). Obviously, Julian is the main songwriter for the band, but JP as we all know plays a crucial part in the composition phase. So, the writer probably just classifies him as a songwriter, and I would agree because he does help them write the music after all. And everyone seems to be getting upset over two sentences! He probably just didn’t have enough space to fully explain the situation with The Strokes. There’s no need to assume the worst, guys. After all there wasn’t a single bad thing said about the band.
The Strokes is just one band that has a hired writer — JP Bowersock.
‘hired’ – wrong
‘writer’ – wrong
Dude, I stopped reading this little essay you wrote for school when you got to The Strokes’ part. I mean, you’ve clearly pissed off some Strokes’s fans, indeed. but that’s not all that’s bothered me.
You’re trying to be a journalist, right? There’s quite a few point’s there: telling the truth, manipulating it, you know; but telling it wrong by MISTAKE or, even, MISINFORMATION.
You do have a point on your column, but you’ve failed to write it, man.
With that said, I didn’t feel like coming here just to say bad stuff about you, just to give you some constructive criticism.
Oh, and Val…. “There’s a humility and grace that comes across in your thoughts,”?!?! Come on! Lack of humility is what got this guy to screw up the article in the first place, by assuming some thought he had was the absolute truth, instead of going out to see if it was actually true!
Nick The Strokes are not a good example for this story, even though it is interesting. Read the credits on their albums and learn about Casablancas and co (who is actually a very well respected songwriter) before the sweeping accusations, which are actually at least 10 years old. JP does deserve credit but where its due.
Hmmm. JP Bowersock is very much respected by Strokes fans but he is not the hired writer for the band. Bowersock was not listed as the writer of any of the Strokes songs in their CDs, nor on discog and ASCAP. He was listed in the credits as the ‘guru’ because he mentored several members of the Strokes in guitar. He also helped them fine tune their musical techniques and gave advice for their album recordings, and toured with Jules during his solo phase. If you’ve done some research, say some simple googling, you may realised that quite a few of their songs from the first two albums had early demo versions that had different arrangements and even different riffs from the recorded version. The songs gradually evolved as the band work out the kinks. This was how the band wrote their songs, though Julian did have most of the writing credits for the first three albums (he writes the best hooks in the band imo, but I digress), he also wrote most of the lyrics for all four albums. An example of how the band worked shows in Games (Angles, 2011), the main riff was taken from an unrecorded song of theirs in 2000, prior to their UK EP, when they were still playing in smaller venues.
Pardon my language I’m not exactly a native English speaker. I can’t believe I wrote so much but yeah, I was quite surprised by this assertion. As a result of this erroneous statement, I’m doubting the authenticity of the facts in rest of the article too, even though this topic is something I’m rather interested in.
I suggest you read more about The Strokes. The story about them having someone to write for them is almost 11 years old but everyone knows it was a rumour spread because of Julian’s father’s status. For the rest I agree but please, this is a disgrace to the strokes
do your homework next time…julian wrote everything on the first 3 albums…why do you think angles was barely average?
Erh, did you get a pirated copy of their albums? Please do proper research before writing about The Strokes. (Try http://www.ascap.com for songwriting credits) Even though Bowersock is much respected by the fans, the songs are written by The Strokes. JP Bowersock is credited as their overall ‘guru’, because he mentored some of them in guitar and gave them advice on musical techniques during their recording. He went on to support Casablancas for his solo album tour, when the rest of the band was recording ‘Angles’. Some of the songs in the first 2 albums in particular, came from demo songs that were different from the final recorded version. They even incorporated a riff from one of their unrecorded jamming songs they used to perform briefly in 2000 in their 2011 album. If Bowersock is their hired writer, that would be pretty strange indeed.
Val and Nick sitting in a tree. K I S S I N G.
First comes a column, then comes a compliment, then comes…well I don’t know. What I do know, however, is Julian Casablancas wrote all the lyrics and music for The Strokes’ first and second records. JP Bowersock, if anything, was an editor Julian could bounce ideas off of. He was Julian’s music teacher when he was growing up; not a hired writer.
Ive been a strokes fan since the day they were brought to recognition in the US, til today, and I have never read such a false statement made about the band as this one. Julian Casablancas, along with the others, are all credited to writing their own song lyrics. I believe that all their album booklets include the credits to lyrics, which is entitled to The Strokes…and sometimes, in interviews, you can find out which members of the band contributed their ideas to a specific song. Like Lynn (above) said, JP is their music guru. He most likely gives them pointers on improvement and helps them make the music worthy for listeners to enjoy.
Sorry buddy, but Julian Casablancas is the sole song and lyrics writer for their first album, Is This It.  On Room on Fire, Casablancas is credited as songwriter on every song except Automatic Stop, where Albert Hammond Jr contributed writing.
Check out the listings on ASCAP: http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=1579919&search_in=c&search_type=exact&search_det=tswpbv&results_pp=30&start=1
JP Bowersock is not credited as having written any of the Strokes material. This is false. All words AND music by Julian Casablancas on the album where Bowersock is listed as guru.
Nick – I rarely ever feel inclined to comment on columns. However, I really agree with you. I’m a music lover, like many, but I always want to know if the artist singing the song is the writer. If I find out they’re not, I associate the songwriter as the “artist” and the singer or band as simply the “performer/s”. Also, this piece is beautifully written. You have an eloquent, intelligent, and thoughtful of conveying your message to people. The fact you say the truth without it coming across as opinionated and rude is a lost art in writing, anymore. I like how you highlighted the positive aspect of the “rap/hip-hop” genre, too. Moreover, it was informative. You taught me something about how the industry works. There’s definitely more credibility when there’s informative information provided educating the reader so they understand what brings you to say what you have to say. This whole approach makes me as the reader respect you as the writer,  which makes me want to read more of what you have to say. There’s a humility and grace that comes across in your thoughts, versus slamming an opinion in one’s face; that humility is a lesson I wish many writer’s would take. Nice work.

While many find themselves sifting through the Top 40 mush of LMFAO, Flo Rida, Ke$ha, Nickelback, David Guetta, Jessie J and the like for something palatable to listen to, Adele proves time and time again what a beacon of light she is for mainstream music with her powerful voice and skillfully designed songs. In fact, it’s no surprise that with her sophomore album 21, she surged to the top of the charts from day one and has stayed there.
As of now, 21 is the second album to hold the number one spot on the Billboard 200 Album Chart for 17 weeks since Billy Ray Cyrus’ 1993 Some Gave All. There are a handful of other albums that have spent longer at #1 such as The Bodyguard soundtrack, which lasted 20 weeks, as well as the soundtrack for West Side Story, which rests impressively at the top of the list with 54 weeks.
Last week, 21 sold 95,000 copies, outselling Adele’s closest competitor that week, the debuting Kidz Bop 21, by 36,000 copies. With no current threats to her chart position, perhaps Adele’s 21 will reach and even roll past the landmark of 21 weeks at number one.

The CEO of Trader Joe’s is slated to receive USC’s highest alumni honor on April 28, the university announced this week.
’69 alumnus Dan Bane, who serves on the USC Leventhal School of Accounting Board of Advisors, will receive the Asa V. Call Alumni Achievement Award, named for the 1931-32 president of the Alumni Association, at the 79th annual USC Alumni Awards at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel.
The annual award has been given to alumni including former Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher and actor John Wayne. It is given to alumni who demonstrate exceptional commitment to the university.
Trader Joe’s appointed Bane chairman and CEO in 2001 after he served as president of Trader Joe’s West. The company has opened more than 100 new stores nationwide since then.
In 2002, Bane decided Trader Joe’s should start selling bottles of Charles Shaw wine. Now, the company sells about 13 million bottles of Two-Buck Chuck annually, according to a press release.
