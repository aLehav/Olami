Actor John Leguizamo discussed the creative process for his one-man comedy play, “Latin History for Morons,” with award-winning director Tony Taccone at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Wednesday. Nearly 60 people attended the Center on Public Diplomacy event, titled “Latin History for Morons: Theatre and Public Diplomacy.” 
CPD partnered with the Center Theatre Group to host the event in an effort to teach the USC community about the role of art in storytelling and how entertainment can be an educational tool. Leguizamo’s comedy show, which has been on Broadway and was a taped Netflix special, seeks to engage and educate audiences about the history of great Latinx contributions to the world.
He was inspired to create the show after learning that his 12-year-old son was getting bullied and racially profiled at school. He said that educating the public about Latinx history is empowering. 
While researching the project, Leguizamo discovered that Latinx people were influential in all of American history, yet the stories of these heroes were not told in history classes. 
“[Latin Americans] are the only ethnic group to have fought in every single war America has ever had,” Leguizamo said. “The second oldest ethnic group in America, after Native Americans.”
This type of shocking “cultural apartheid,” as Leguizamo put it, resulted in a gap in the American public’s knowledge concerning Latinx history, that Leguizamo strives to fill with his show.
In his show, Leguizamo presents Latinx history with as much informational depth as he can, while striving to make it comedic in an attempt to keep the audience properly engaged with the historical material. His inspiration for this format was his own educational experience in school.
“My favorite teachers and professors were always the most outrageous and the funniest,” Leguizamo said. “Tony and I took it to an exaggerated place as I want to reach young Latinx people.”
Taccone added that the show had to balance humor with respect and that no actor can make everyone happy. 
“There are also comic edges, [like] at what point … [is a joke] too offensive … you try to find what the balance is,” Taccone said. “One of the great things about John is that he is equally skilled as a comic actor as he is as a dramatic actor.” 
Many audience members were curious about how Leguizamo was able to synthesize Latin American history and about whether he views himself as a cultural ambassador for Latinx people. Leguizamo said he thinks of himself less as a role model and more as a figure that his community can relate to. 
“Latin kids had never seen a Latin person on stage,” he said. “I don’t go into it thinking I’m representing my people, but I do go into it thinking I’m talking to my people. I’m a mirror…so [Latinx people] can see themselves, to see that we have value … and [are] culturally relevant.”
Leguizamo emphasized how the purpose of the show is to pay respect to the Latinx community. 
“In ‘Latin History For Morons’ the ‘morons’ [are] all of us. We [Latin people] ourselves don’t know our contributions to America, let alone the world,” Leguizamo said. “The purpose of the show is to give Latinx people self-respect and to ask other people — non-Latin — to respect us [too].”
Lenora Quinonez, a graduate student studying public diplomacy, found the event enlightening and appreciates Leguizamo’s goal to represent Latin history in a respectful and meaningful way. 
“I don’t really know that much about Latin history,” she said, “but I’m more interested now.” 
Ashley Baird, a graduate student studying communication management, said she attended the event to learn more about Latinx culture. 
“My husband is a Mexican immigrant … so I want to learn more about Latin culture,” Baird said.“My family has always been open-minded to other cultures, so I’m interested to learn more.”  
However, not everyone is as open-minded when watching the show. Leguizamo acknowledges that he cannot please everyone. 
“You can’t be an artist and want to please. I think you have to do your work and take the consequences,” Leguizamo said.

The other day, I read a story about a high school swimmer from Dimond High School in Anchorage, Alaska, who had been disqualified at a meet because of how her school-issued one-piece competition suit fit her body.
It was absolutely ridiculous. Why? Because having swam on a co-ed team in high school, I know that there is not much that is more revealing than a men’s competition Speedo-style suit.
I’m sort of kidding, but sort of not. 
The gist of this story is that 17-year-old state championship swimmer Breckynn Willis swam four races in a meet Friday and was disqualified from the second event after she won it. 
When the unnamed official made the call to disqualify Willis, Annette Rohde, who was also officiating the meet, said she told her, “I need to know how you’re defining this, because this is going to blow up.” 
Rohde was right. 
The official told Rohde that Willis’ suit was “so far up I could see butt cheek touching butt cheek.” Essentially, Willis was disqualified for the way her body fit into the suit her school had told her to wear. Her uniform wasn’t incorrect, but rather, her body type and how it looked in the suit was deemed “incorrect.” 
The Alaska School Activities Association implemented the existing uniform guidelines last year, and the disqualification policy this year. These rules have proven to be far too subjective, leaving it to the discretion of the referee to decide what is too revealing and whether or not it is intentional.
Willis’ disqualification was “heavy-handed and unnecessary,” the Anchorage School District said in a statement. “Our swimmer was targeted based solely on how a standard, school-issued uniform happened to fit the shape of her body.” The Anchorage School District was right to stand with Willis, especially given that she was wearing the team suit. 
Beyond that, it is natural for women’s suits to ride up during events. Competition suits are meant to be skin tight, creating as little drag as possible. As you move your arms to stroke, the shoulder straps of the suit tend to pull the backside up. 
But this issue existed long before Sept. 6. It started last year when one Anchorage parent commented that “You girls need to cover up for the sake of my boys.” It was a bold statement to make, given that women’s competition suits “cover up” more than that parent’s sons’ suits did. The key point: Men’s competition suits are very revealing, but they’re not sexualized. 
The Washington Post reported that another parent, the father of a child on the Dimond High School team, took photos of Willis’ backside. He then circulated those photos of Willis, then a 16-year-old, to other parents via email. 
There is nothing inherently wrong or inappropriate about anybody’s body. People like the unnamed referee and the two parents mentioned are the ones who create the issue. They sexualized a teenage girl’s body. Rather than focusing on her swimming, they focused on a high school girl’s butt. 
Willis’ disqualification was overturned this week, and she is now officially the winner of that 100 meter Freestyle event. 
This is a small victory, but it highlights the larger issue with how women in sports — or any industry, really — are acknowledged. All too often, the emphasis is placed on appearance rather than their achievements. 
Sexualizing female athletes is nothing new. Take, for example, how female athletes are portrayed in the media — even in sports magazines. Ben Wasike, a professor at the University of Texas–Rio Grande Valley, analyzed every cover from 1954 to 2016 of Sports Illustrated and every cover from 1998 to 2016 of ESPN The Magazine. He confirmed that women on the covers were more likely than men to be portrayed in a sexualized manner, while men were more likely to be portrayed in active poses. 
It’s discouraging, especially for younger women, to see that female athletes’ achievements aren’t enough to exist on their own. Sure, their accomplishments get covered, but even at the highest levels, female athletes are often asked about their outfits or their love lives, things reporters would never think to ask male athletes in a post-game interview. 
A full analysis of how women are portrayed in sports is outside the scope of this 800-word column, but the outcry over Willis’ disqualification shows that we’re moving toward placing less attention on women’s bodies and more focus on their athletic ability. 
I would say that now that this is all over, Willis can get back to swimming. But I think this incident, although resolved, will spark discourse that calls into question not only how we recognize professional female athletes’ bodies in the spotlight but also younger athletes at the high school level.

The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team will travel to Claremont and La Verne this weekend to participate in the 2019 Inland Empire Classic. With a bevy of talent prepared for the season, it is more than likely the Trojans will see some success.
While the tournament marks the start of the regular season for USC, each of its opponents participated in the 2019 Triton Invitational hosted by UC San Diego this past weekend. 
USC will first face off against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, which is coming off a 1-3 outing at the San Diego tournament. The Trojans will need to put up a strong defensive effort to ward off scoring chances from the Stags’ junior attacker Rob Driscoll and senior attacker Zack Rossman. When the two teams last met in 2018, USC junior goalie Vaios Vlahotasios was able to fend off the offensive drive with six saves and just 1 goal allowed.
The Trojans faced their second tournament opponent, Whittier College, twice last season, beating the Poets 25-4 and 13-2 in part because of multiple goals from redshirt senior 2-meter Sam Slobodien and junior drivers Jacob Mercep and Marko Vavic.
Sunday’s matchup should prove to be the toughest of the weekend for USC as the team takes on No. 4 UC Santa Barbara, which looks to extend its four-game winning streak. After losing consistent top-scorer Borislav Jovanovic, who poured in an impressive 78 goals last season, junior attacker Cole Brosnan and senior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic have stepped up to fill the gap for the Gauchos.  
Last season, USC’s overall record against UCSB improved with two crucial wins, with the second 16-2 victory culminating in 17 combined saves by sophomore goalkeepers Nic Porter and Sam Krutonog.
UCSB’s undefeated run at the Triton Invitational included its first win over No. 5 Cal since 2004. Goals from Gvozdanovic, sophomore driver Nathan Puentes, sophomore utility Connor Moynihan and senior attacker Jacob Halle rounded out the score at 8-5. After this win and another over then-No. 5 Long Beach State to win the invitational, UCSB moved up to No. 4 in the Collegiate Water Polo Association men’s varsity poll.
The Trojans are taking a prospective approach to their Sunday morning matchup, as Porter notes that rosters and strategies can change dramatically.
“We’re not really looking at how we won against them last season because our team is slightly different, their team is slightly different,” Porter said. “They had a very good win against Berkeley over the weekend, so we’re not going to be taking anybody lightly, that’s for sure.”
Rounding out the Classic on Sunday, USC will face Concordia University. The Trojans scored an impressive 73 total points in three matchups last season against the Eagles. Senior Cullen Mooers is taking over as the Eagles’ starting goalie this season, and in this game the USC offense will look to build an early lead.
Although the Trojans were ranked No. 1 in the preseason national rankings, complacency in these early games is not an option. 
“We appreciate the No. 1 seed, but we have to justify that in the pool,” Mercep said. “We are not running away from any responsibility. If we are considered [the] favorite then we’re going into the season excited, as we should be.”
After news surrounding the team this summer centered on the firing of former head coach Jovan Vavic following his alleged involvement in the college admissions scandal, his successor and longtime former associate head coach Marko Pintaric is looking to set a new tone for the season.
“We’re not taking anybody lightly. I always tell my guys, it’s very important to take every game possible as a preparation for any of the games you play, being the NCAA finals, world championship finals, it’s always a way that you practice your preparations,” Pintaric said. “We are getting ready for every opponent the same way, and I’m trying to teach them to show respect to every opponent the same way.”
On Saturday, the Trojans face Claremont-Mudd-Scripps at noon and Whittier at 1:20 p.m. in Claremont. On Sunday, the team plays No. 4 UC Santa Barbara at 10:20 a.m. and Concordia at 1 p.m. in La Verne.

After what was probably the program’s biggest win since 2017, USC shocked both its own fanbase and the college football world by soundly stomping then-No. 23-ranked Stanford after an unconvincing win against Fresno State. After freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis’ breakout in his first game as USC’s starter, expectations for this team are higher than they’ve been in a long time as it heads to Utah for a matchup with BYU. 
The 1-1 Cougars also come into the game riding high after a thrilling comeback victory on the road against Tennessee. 
Though on paper USC should be the better team all around, the difficult atmosphere in Provo and a motivated BYU squad could turn this into a trap game.
USC Offense vs BYU Defense
A week into “Kedon Season,” the USC offense looks completely different from last year. Slovis’ skillset makes him the perfect show-runner for offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s offense; he does a good job cycling through reads quickly and can place the ball accurately to any spot on the field. He can make incredibly difficult throws, as evident in his performance last week. 
That confidence in his ability does occasionally lead him to make risky throws, and it’s unlikely that he’ll be able to get away with them as often as he did against Stanford. With that said, the Trojan receiving corps is one of the deepest and most talented in the country, which gives Slovis more leeway to take chances. 
Wide receivers senior Michael Pittman Jr., sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown and redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns have all been highly productive for the Trojans thus far, and as Slovis grows more comfortable in his role, the chemistry between him and his pass catchers will come even more naturally.
However, perhaps the biggest contributor to the success of the Trojan offense has been the offensive line. The big men up front have been stellar the past two weeks, consistently giving Slovis clean pockets and plenty of time to work with. 
BYU is ranked No. 20 in pass yards allowed — impressive on paper, but diminished after a closer look at the film. Neither of its opponents thus far have featured a strong passing offense. The Cougars have faced only 44 pass attempts thus far, making their 282 pass yards allowed significantly less impressive.
 Additionally, the Cougars have only managed one sack in two games. Against a Trojan offensive line that’s played so well, that number seems unlikely to change much. Even if USC doesn’t put up the gaudy passing numbers it did last week, expect it to be efficient and successful through the air.
On the ground, the Trojans’ prospects seem even better against a BYU defense that’s allowed 5.2 yards per carry, good for No. 128 in the nation. USC is strong at running back, with junior tailback Stephen Carr and redshirt junior tailback Vavae Malepeai both playing at a high level (7.4 and 5 yards per carry, respectively on a similar number of carries) behind a capable run-blocking offensive line. The Trojans should put up a lot of points Saturday, as the talent gap between them and the BYU defense is just too wide.
BYU Offense vs USC Defense
BYU’s offense is led by sophomore quarterback Zach Wilson, who has thrown for 440 yards and completed nearly 65% of his passes through two games. Wilson is a legitimately talented quarterback with very good arm talent, strong mobility and solid decision making. Although he hasn’t been the gunslinging superstar many expected him to become in his second year, he’s capable of playing excellent football going forward. 
Although BYU doesn’t feature any star pass-catchers, its receiving corps is a decent group. The group’s performance in the closing stages of last week’s comeback against Tennessee was a big part of the victory. Against a Trojan defense that is still shaky in its pass rush and youthful in the secondary, the BYU passing attack could have its best game of the young season. 
On the ground, senior running back Ty’Son Williams has been impressive for the Cougars, carrying the ball at a clip of 5.7 yards per carry with 3 touchdowns. USC’s defense has struggled to tackle in both of its games so he could be in for a big day as well. 
The BYU offense doesn’t feature as much top end talent as the Trojans have on defense, but with a good day from Wilson and Williams, it could put up an impressive number of points Saturday against a Trojan defense that hasn’t found its identity.
PREDICTION: 42-31, USC
In a game with two talented young quarterbacks and two questionable defenses, expect the showdown in Provo to be a shootout. Both teams will score often on the ground and through the air. However, the gap between USC’s offense and BYU’s defense is significantly wider than it is on the other side of the ball. 
The Trojans have playmakers like sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin and freshman defensive lineman Drake Jackson on their defense, and despite the unit’s shortcomings, they’re capable of creating turnovers and stopping enough drives to keep the Cougars in check. Though a sloppy performance from the Trojans could easily turn this into a trap game, they should be strong enough on both sides of the ball to beat the Cougars.

Before the Thornton School of Music was even called the Thornton School of Music, Maestro Carl St. Clair was conducting at USC. 
St. Clair began teaching when he was just 24 years old and now has over 42 years teaching across the country. His fascination with music began at a young age when he started taking piano lessons from his aunt as a mere 6-year-old.
“I gravitated toward music very early in my life,” said St. Clair, who taught himself how to play the trumpet. “It’s become my life partner. It’s a talent that God gave me and my gift back to him is how I utilize it.”
St. Clair’s talent has allowed him to travel the world conducting various symphonies. He has conducted for the Syrian National Symphony Orchestra in Damascus, the Beijing Philharmonic behind the walls of the Forbidden City and various student orchestras. Each eclectic performance shaped St. Clair’s philosophy of music.
“The music spoke to the musicians and the audience and got the same exact reaction,” St. Clair said, “which only proved to me that there is a connective essence to music, that it is a universal language and can speak to all people of all walks of life.”
St. Clair believes the  audience is an integral part of a symphonic performance and the canvas on which the musicians and conductor display their passion for music. Without the audience, the craft of a symphony would go unappreciated.
“Part of our job when we have an audience is to perform great works of music in a way which when the audience leaves, they’re a different individual,” St. Clair said. “We want to bring our passion to them. We want to play with all our hearts so that their hearts are changed.”
Such a goal cannot be accomplished without top notch performers who perform with purpose and honesty. With the right musicians, St. Clair believes the audience will take something home with them after the curtains have closed — something that makes an audience member more mature, thoughtful and informed. St. Clair has absolute confidence in the ability of Thornton students to engage and inspire audiences.
“The students at the Thornton School of Music are at a noticeably higher level of technical proficiency than [the students] we were back when I went to college at UT Austin,” St. Clair said.
With fast-paced modern times, St. Clair recognizes how the presentation of music has to change — without altering the music itself — to better engage and inspire the modern audience.
“Keep it fresh, keep it inspirational, keep it motivational so that as the times change, our musical world has to also evolve,” St. Clair said. “It’s not so much that the music changes, but what changes is the presentation.”
Throughout St. Clair’s years of experience, global travels and teaching the talented students he conducts, he has maintained his faith in the unifying power that music has. He remembers the profound experience he had performing Tchaikovsky’s Pathétique Symphony and the piece’s lasting effect. 
“[The music] touched everybody’s soul in a very similar way,” St. Clair said. “The same music, those same notes [are] performed by the performers and also for the audiences. And so I would say that it’s a lesson in the importance of music as a connector of lives and as a connector of hearts.”

While most kids grew up singing along to the catchy tunes of Sesame Street and Disney movie soundtracks, the Siess household was filled with the emotionally evocative sounds of Pyotr Tchaikovsky and classical violinists like Perlman. 
“As a young kid … I thought Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture was awesome because when you’re a little kid [the sound of] cannons [is] super cool,” Siess said. 
Since he was 4, Michael Siess has devoted his life to the violin — a haunting yet beautiful instrument, cradled by some of the most celebrated classical musicians of all time. 
Siess attributes this loving obsession to his parents, who both have careers in music. 
“Because they were both musicians, I was going to watch their concerts as well,” Siess said. “My mom as a violinist played in a lot of different orchestras around town, and my dad was a band director, so I [saw] what he was doing with his classes and conducting.” 
While his childhood has played a large role in his musical life, Seiss’ crescendoing devotion to classical music stems from its unparalleled depth and complexity. 
Siess is currently working on Debussy’s String Quartet, a challenging but richly layered composition. As musicians and scholars, Siess believes that it’s the group’s job to search for every color and extract every musical grain possible.  
“It’s my favorite quartet of all time,” Siess said. “Every single movement offers so much versatility and it’s one of those pieces — once you hear it — you’ll instantly know why it’s special and why it’s unique.” 
For Siess, pursuing a career in classical performance is not only a commitment to technical mastery but also to lifelong learning. At USC, Siess has perfected his skills by completing a master’s degree in violin performance — and is currently working on a graduate certificate in violin performance as well. 
“No matter what kind of piece you’re playing, whether it’s the Shostakovich Symphony that we’ve been preparing or a solo movement of Bach, there’s always something to explore,” Siess said. “No matter where you are in your experience, you’re never done learning from it. Every single performance you have to find a different way to make it fresh, make it relevant and do something that you haven’t done before with it.” 
Finding new meaning is especially crucial if classical music is meant to capture and maintain the attention of a 21st century audience.
“People are going to have to be a little more flexible and adaptable in terms of how they program and how they market themselves as artists going forward,” Siess said. “We need to find ways that we can give people a unique experience that’s actually worth coming out to.” 
In response to the changing landscape of the music industry, Siess is collaborating with other musicians from USC and the Colburn School in downtown Los Angeles on an original concert series called “Mixtape Series.” According to its website, the small ensemble weaves together different selections of music based on similarities in harmony, mood and rhythm into a cohesive program. 
“In this kind of format everybody gets a variety pack of repertoire in a way that makes sense for a modern audience,” Siess said. “Because each selection is no more than, say, four to six minutes, it’s easier to focus and you can find something a little more engaging as opposed to being hit on the head with 30 minutes of one thing.” 
While Siess has a particular interest in chamber music because of its intimate nature, his time with the orchestra at USC has been a special experience. Early in his first year with the orchestra, Siess was selected to be one of the leaders of the group — where he served as the principal violinist several times. 
“Starting out strong like that, I’ve been expected and I’ve always tried to carry myself as a leader within the orchestra,” he said.
For Siess, there’s no better feeling than performing with his friends and colleagues. 
“It’s been such a fun program,” he said. “Our conductor Carl St. Clair really establishes a wonderful culture where everyone can get excited about the music and fully invest in what they’re doing.” 
The Thornton Symphony will open the season with a performance of Shostakovich’s 10th Symphony this Friday at 7:30 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium.

The United States, what a place. The land of oversized meals, frantic football fans and the promising American dream. 
Some are born into this unique culture and learn the ins and outs of being American from parents also raised in the United States. However, another significant portion of this country belongs to people who have traveled great lengths to explore an entirely different part of the world. Sometimes, this transition is extremely challenging — language barriers, laws and regulations, classroom settings and more elements are vastly different in various regions. USC needs to support that. International students need a resource on campus that they can depend on not only for logistics but also for guidance on how to adjust to a completely new world. 
International students make up nearly a quarter of the Trojan family, and 15% of students who entered in Fall 2017 came from countries outside the U.S. USC’s Office of International Services does a great job of helping students get their paperwork established and answering any logistical questions; however, it is tough for these students to get acclimated socially when there isn’t a place on campus that specifically supports that. Because of this, hosting more social events and gatherings at the Office of International Services would be a step in the right direction for the office. 
Lunar New Year and Tet are extremely important holiday for Chinese and Vietnamese cultures, respectively. Often times, plane tickets or timing are too much to figure out for a long trek home to see family on these important dates, so the Office of International Services might serve as a space to house international students, but it’s not necessarily a place for all international students to congregate. Parkside IRC does a good job of supporting international students through signature events, including ones celebrating Diwali, Lunar New Year and Persian New Year. But not every international student may have access to the residential college system. 
Obviously, being separated from family and the sudden derailing of traditions can be a lot for a student’s overall well-being. This is one way the University’s Office of International Services can actually service its students.
Simply, students need a place they can confidently rely on socially. More integration between the Office of International Services and the fraternities and sororities could be a start. Maybe a collaborative effort between these two largely populated groups could lead to a more fun and easy transition for the students who are in a completely different culture. They are not the only ones who are separated from loved ones, as the large majority of students in the undergraduate program do not live at home. Thus, both parties would greatly benefit from a social event to distract from the homesickness.
This is by no means a concrete solution to the issue of depression among the international student community nor is it a shame on the Office of International Services for its meager offering of social events. The office should simply make the college experience better for a very large community on campus that faces a very unique set of problems. Not only are students coming to the United States, but the students are coming to Los Angeles, one of the busiest cities in the nation. A city like this can be very overwhelming to many people and can take some getting used to, but it would be easier if there was a place of refuge to answer life questions. The Office of International Services can definitely be this place.
Nevertheless, there can always be work done to improve the social climate on this campus. There will always be ways to improve resource centers, social clubs and student government organizations, but it really begins with awareness. 
Acclimating to the new environment is something that Trojans commonly face, regardless of where they are from. Listening to the social needs of the international student community would be a great start toward improving the University’s overall college experience.

After a disappointing weekend that saw the Trojans go 1-2 in Iowa, the USC women’s volleyball team will battle this weekend with Yale, Howard and Villanova at the Trojan Invitational.
After injuries to star seniors outside hitter Khalia Lanier and opposite Emily Baptista, USC is off to a tough start. However, even with the struggles, head coach Brent Crouch is taking a positive attitude into the rest of the season.
“I see us becoming better at what we’re trying to do,” Crouch said. “We are going to stay the course and get comfortable with doing what we do.”
Lanier and Baptista are not easily replaceable, but while their returns for the weekend are questionable, Crouch is not breaking a sweat.
“Whether Khalia and Emily are back or not, I expect we roll with the same lineup we had last weekend and to go 3-0 [this weekend],” Crouch said.
Despite finishing their 2018 season at 19-5 overall, Yale has also gotten off to a slow start, dropping all of its first three games of the season. Both teams are in similar positions after losing key veteran players. 
Though it hasn’t won a match this season, Yale has an impressive kill rate, and USC must continue to play well on defense this weekend. 
Specifically, the Trojans must limit their errors, and it will be essential not to let first home game nerves get in the way.
Last weekend, the team struggled to score enough kills. Crouch said it has to improve that this week — especially against Howard, whom the Trojans will play in the second game this weekend. 
“We need to get more kills, and we are working a lot on offense this week and fine tuning,” Crouch said. “Nothing major, just getting the speed of our offense correct and a little faster.”
One way USC can overcome the 2-6 Bisons is by taking advantage of their errors. Howard has already made 185 errors this season with almost twice as many serving errors as their opponents. Crouch said possible ‘freebies’ from Bison errors could go a long way in helping USC win.  
“If we can play clean volleyball, and Howard wants to give us free points through their errors, well, we’ll take it,” he said.  
USC will wrap up the Trojan Invitational with Villanova, who began this season 5-1 and should provide tough competition. So far, the Wildcats have 279 kills on the season and have six players who already have more than 25 kills this year. 
The Trojans’ rocky start to the 2019 campaign has  seen them drop from No. 12 to 20 in the NCAA rankings. The team itself is not concerned with its ranking drop as USC has been playing with a hobbled lineup, and its low ranking will give it an underdog mentality for the foreseeable future. 
Although the competition is tough, the team is thrilled to play at home. The schools are not exactly rivals, but all are traditionally successful programs. Crouch hopes for a full house for every game at the Invitational. 
“We’d love to have our opening weekend packed this weekend,” he said. “It will be good volleyball going on, so hopefully people come out and pack that place up.”
The tournament begins this weekend on Friday and will run through Saturday. All games will take place at the Galen Center.

The No. 6-ranked USC women’s soccer team will face Seattle on Friday after starting its season 6-0 for the first time in program history. 
The Trojans are coming off two shutout wins against Northern Arizona and Nebraska. Sophomore keeper Anna Smith has impressed many by starting the past 4 games in place of injured redshirt junior Kaylie Collins.
Offensively, the Trojans have appeared unstoppable with forwards junior Tara McKeown and sophomore Penelope Hocking. McKeown and Hocking are responsible for 12 of the Trojans’ 16 goals so far this season, and have also combined for seven assists.
Hocking scored 3 goals combined in the Northern Arizona and Nebraska games — 2 of them assisted by McKeown. 
McKeown has been leading USC’s offense, either scoring or assisting on goals in each of the first six games. McKeown leads the team this season with 7 goals. 
”I’m really excited to have scorers that have this kind of consistency,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “For [McKeown and Hocking] to be as skilled as they are and as fast as they are … is definitely a luxury for our team.” 
The Trojans have also been dominant defensively, holding their opponents to just 3 goals so far this season. On the other hand, Seattle has played outstanding offense, so USC must enter the match with a strong game plan in order to slow the Redhawks down. 
McAlpine understands that Seattle will not be an easy matchup on the road, and McAlpine thinks the team’s 4-0 road loss to Gonzaga on Sunday could provide extra fuel against the Trojans. 
”It is harder to play a team coming off a loss because they are a little bit more motivated, and they are going to be at home,” McAlpine said. “So, they will be a lot more comfortable in the way they want to play their style.”
The Trojans will need to be ready to face a motivated Redhawks team. With all his team’s success so far this season, McAlpine understands that it is important for the Trojans to remain focused, and to prepare for one game at a time. 
“We also respect the opponent, and we know that there’s plenty of talent up there with great players, great coaches and great organization,” McAlpine said. “We just try to focus on each game because we understand that at any moment we can be beat.”
USC will look to extend its fast start to seven straight wins starting at 7 p.m. on Friday in Seattle.

When Bob Mintzer isn’t teaching freshmen the fundamentals of jazz or honing graduate students’ improvisation skills, he’s composing new music for his big band. Or he’s playing saxophone for the Yellowjackets, a highly sought-after jazz band, in gigs around the world. 
Simply put, Bob Mintzer is a busy man; but even with his myriad commitments, he’s not slowing down. 
“I love all of it,” Mintzer said. “I love teaching and working with young people and playing and writing. I’m getting to sort of live my dream.” 
As a conservatory student in New York City, Mintzer often frequented jazz clubs and the marquee names that performed — Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock and Thelonious Monk among others. He studied classical music, but jazz kept his palate diverse. Ultimately, jazz became his calling card, honing his skills as a saxophonist for the Buddy Rich Big Band. 
“We were touring every night,” Mintzer said. “I learned a lot about ensemble playing and I started writing and arranging for Big Band, which was kind of unheard of. I was a novice arranger when I started but I wrote eight or nine pieces for the band and grew in leaps and bounds having an opportunity to hear what I wrote on a nightly basis.”
In the 45 years since then, Mintzer has, to put it mildly, accomplished a lot. 
He’s a Grammy award-winning musician. He has moved from sideman status to the leader of his own Big Band. His discography of work is endless. In the contemporary jazz world, Mintzer is a household name. 
Now, he’s the Chair of Jazz Studies at the Thornton School of Music, opening up his vault of knowledge and experience to students. The things Mintzer learned under Buddy Rich’s tutelage he hopes to pass on to the next generation of musicians. 
“There were many generous, giving people that I was lucky enough to come in contact with as an aspiring musician,” Mintzer said. “My vision is to teach students how to teach themselves … I hope they grow to be extremely accomplished on their instrument and as instigators — someone who gathers people together to play the music that represents their vision.” 
Mintzer recognizes jazz as an ever-changing sound, which is why he pushes students to “cross-pollinate,” or study various styles to become more diverse musicians. 
“We really encourage students to be broad in their scope,” Mintzer said. “I would say that’s now more critical than ever nowadays. Diversity is the key to sustaining a career in any form of music.” 
He also believes the core tenets of jazz are constant.
“Jazz to me is a sensibility rather than a genre. It’s always meant improvisation, spontaneity, setting guidelines through collaboration and conversation and creating something different every time.” 
As the head of jazz studies, Mintzer navigates a species of music that is dynamic and complicated, while applying his age-old wisdom to students who intend on mastering it.
The jazz program is quite active around campus — it puts on concerts at Carson Center Monday nights and holds several jazz nights throughout the semester. The program also hosts workshops in The Music Center for all students of all majors, even those with limited music experience. Sometimes, Mintzer leads these group sessions, playing his saxophone for the talented and novice musicians. 
There are no signs of Mintzer slowing down: his energy for music is relentless, and, no matter how packed his schedule, he’ll always be looking for more opportunities to perform, compose and — above all — teach.

Ganja, pot, kush, weed, grass — cannabis has taken on many different names throughout its history in the U.S. As weed culture evolves, so does the slang used to describe the drug. But one word has stood the test of time: marijuana. 
The etymology of marijuana has long been debated, with many potential explanations for the origins of the word. Some suggest folk origins with the name of “María Juana” and others theorize the word has linguistic origins outside of Spanish. Nevertheless, the term can be traced back to late-19th century Latin American Spanish, where it is also stylized as “marihuana” and “mariguana.”
To understand the popularization of the term in America, it’s vital to first consider how cannabis was consumed more than a hundred years ago. 
Prior to the Mexican Revolution, in the early 1900s, medicines containing cannabis and its extracts were easily accessible — sold in local drugstores to treat common illnesses. Around the same time, experimenting with expensive cannabis-imported goods became a trend among the American elite. The term “marijuana” did not exist before 1910.
At the end of the 1920s, close to one million Mexican immigrants had come to the U.S. seeking refuge from the revolution. They brought with them the habit of smoking cannabis, a concept which had not yet entered mainstream U.S. culture. 
When the Great Depression rocked the country, people began looking for scapegoats — Mexican immigrants and Black Americans. With that came the racialization and criminalization of the plant, which was largely accompanied by the propagation of the term “marijuana.” 
Harry Anslinger, the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, a predecessor to the modern Drug Enforcement Administration, has been regarded as “the first architect of the War on Drugs,” according to CBS News. Once appointed, Anslinger launched a virulent anti-marijuana campaign to keep the FBN, a bureau reeling from a failed attempt at Prohibition, alive and well. Even though Anslinger had ridiculed the notion that cannabis led to increased violence, he flipped his stance just a couple years later. 
Anslinger sought to rid the country of all drugs for personal political gain and was undoubtedly the root cause of the popularization of the word marijuana. Anslinger picked the word strategically — marijuana was “foreign-sounding,” easily associated with the new immigrant population. The “exotic” stylization of the word further drove the association, since it is in Spanish and not English, that the letter “j” is pronounced like the letter “h.” 
In his speeches and appearances before Congress, Anslinger spewed racist propaganda, claiming that marijuana made brown and Black men “think they’re as good as white men.” Supporters then latched onto his crusade, spreading the racialized term into American vernacular and villainizing people of color. Anslinger’s claims, steeped in hatred, weren’t even medically accurate — 29 out of 30 doctors stated the drug was not dangerous.
But it was too late. 
Soon enough, lawmakers across the states forgot that just decades earlier, the high and mighty (pun intended!) rich, white population had first introduced the drug into modern American consciousness. Mass media and yellow journalists carried his false messages across the country, spreading tales of crazed individuals who committed crimes under the influence of the drug. The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, the end product of Anslinger’s campaign, federally criminalized cannabis in every state. 
But racist anti-marijuana rhetoric didn’t stop there. Subsequent administrations continued what Anslinger had started. Enter President Richard Nixon and the War on Drugs (honorable mentions include former First Lady Nancy Reagan and the “Just Say No” campaign). 
“Though the word ‘marijuana’ is the most common name for cannabis in the United States today, its history is deeply steeped in race, politics and a complicated cultural revolution,” writes Anna Wilcox on Leafly, a prominent cannabis related website.
Considering this, how we talk about marijuana matters. From the term itself to the discriminatory history it carries, our perception of cannabis has to change. Avenues of conversations need to stray away from the pejorative and dive deeper into exploring actual scientific facts. 
Without a doubt, the history of cannabis in the United States is inextricably linked with racial narratives from the early 20th century. 
Even now, as we have seemingly made progress as legalization has gained ground, we cannot speak about cannabis without also speaking about over-policing, racial profiling and incarceration. But that’s for another column.
