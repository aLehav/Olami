While USC’s admission rate dropped to a historic low at 13 percent, the University had the largest number of matriculated students this year with a record 3,401 freshmen, according to a news release from the USC’s admission office. 
“We’re seeing a remarkably strong match between the students we select for admission and those who decide to join the Trojan Family,” wrote Timothy Brunold, the dean of admission. “They have outstanding options in higher education, and they can select from the best universities in the country. We’re honored they chose this university.”
According to Director of Admission Kirk Brennan, the yield rate, which typically doesn’t increase by more than a point or two, increased by 4 percent from 2017. This year, USC received a record-high number of over 64,000 applications, an increase of 7,300 applications. 
Brennan attributed this increasing yield rate to the enhanced reputation of USC, the growth of downtown Los Angeles and USC Village, among other factors.
“The last two years have really represented unprecedented jump in what we see as interest in attending,” Brennan said. “We’re really excited about that.”
Brennan said that the group growing at the fastest rate is the multiple ethnicities category, which includes students whose parents are of different races. He added that despite the fact that black students comprise only 6 percent of the entire class, the number does not include those who identify as multiple races or ethnicities.
“I think it’s important to note that typically half the students in [the multiple ethnicities] category identify as African American and one other ethnicity,” Brennan said. “I think students see that there is real progress happening at USC when it comes to fostering a climate of inclusion.”
One in four freshmen identify as part of an underrepresented group in higher education, according to the release. Additionally, 17 percent of the freshman class are first-generation students. 
“When these students graduate, they’ll help reshape vital professions and endeavors, so they look more like the world we’re part of,” said Timothy Brunold, in the release.
Along with racial and ethnic diversity, 17 percent of the freshman class came from outside the United States. China, India, Canada, South Korea and the United Kingdom sent the most students to USC. Domestically, students come from every state. The most represented states are California, Texas, New York, Illinois, Washington and Florida. 
While the University continues to welcome students from all over the country and the world, USC is working to accept more students from the neighboring community. Foshay Learning Center and the USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative sends many top students to USC every year, Brennan said. Foshay is among the top five schools to send students to the University.
“We treat NAI students as already part of the Trojan Family,” Brennan said. “I want our neighbors to feel welcomed on our own campus.”

Listen to “How the L.A. Times Investigated USC (ft. Matt Hamilton and Harriet Ryan)” on Spreaker.
We sit down with Los Angeles Times reporters Harriet Ryan and Matt Hamilton to discuss how they and other Times reporters worked to break multiple stories about USC. The Times has broken stories about several top University employees, including former Keck dean Carmen Puliafito and former gynecologist George Tyndall. Their reporting sheds light into the inner workings of USC, and what allowed those incidents of misconduct to occur. Music by Joakim Karud.

Members of the presidential search committee listened to comments from students, staff, faculty and alumni who expressed needs for pay equity and racial diversity on campus. (Gabriela Thur De Koos | Daily Trojan)
The Board of Trustees held its second presidential search forum in Aresty Conference Center on the Health Sciences Campus Monday. USC community members spoke about issues at the University to 12 members of the 23-person search committee, most of which are Board members. 
To start off the session, Chairman Rick Caruso explained the process of finding a new president for the University. These three sessions over the past week only constitute the first of five phases, he said. 
Caruso then made a public apology to the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media for what he called a mistake on University Communications’ part during the Sept. 13 session. While the forum was taking place, reporters from student media outlets were not permitted to take notes and were told they could only ask follow-up questions after the event.
Following Caruso’s introduction and apology, the Board gave the floor to the staff, students and alumni present. Speakers voiced needs that ranged from pay equity among workers on the Health Sciences Campus to an increase in racial diversity by offering more financial aid to undergraduate students.
Grant Amann, a sophomore majoring in urban studies and planning, was the only undergraduate student to speak at the forum and emphasized the importance of teaching. According to Amann, the USC Center for Excellence in Teaching can potentially help inspire a stronger community among students and professors.
“I’ve heard a lot of discouraging things from my peers, and I’ve seen personally a lot of things from professors that are just not the best teaching habits,” Amann said. “I truly believe that a university can only be as good as its teachers, and I know we have things in place, but I don’t think they are getting the attention that they need.”
Kristina Williams, a graduate student at the Iovine and Young Academy, said that the future president needs to hold more accountability on diversity and inclusion on campus. Williams said that as a person of color she was disappointed that the Academy’s orientation video featured four white men and one racially ambiguous man. For Williams, the Academy is centered on disruption and innovation, but that the campus does not reflect such inclusivity.
In response to this discrepancy, Williams is conducting a research capstone project that will identify gaps in opportunities across campus and redesign the program’s curriculum to set a better standard for diversity and inclusion.

“For the next president, I hope for there to be someone who holds accountability and standards for these issues, for there to be a culture that isn’t giving weight for me to have to do this research in a program that I’m paying to be in,” Williams said.
The conversation then expanded to faculty and alumni. James Gordon, associate dean of biokinesiology and physical therapy, offered a different perspective on the presidential search. To Gordon, the University is investing too much hope into the future president when the problems with USC lie elsewhere: the University’s culture. 
“We have evolved a culture that has moved us into what I can only term as corruption,” Gordon said. “I think the mission of the University has become to raise money … I know the deans and the provosts are judged not by the excellence of their educational or research programs, but how much money they raise. And that culture that puts money before everything else, I don’t think a new president is going to change that unless we change that mission.”
Alumna Kerry Franco, the Office of Foundation Relations’ senior director of development, voiced similar concerns, noting that the University is more of a “reactive” environment rather than a proactive one when it comes to issues. 
“We try to solve problems by the lens of how it’s going to make us look,” Franco said. “We are so concerned about our image.”
The listening sessions will conclude on Sept. 25 in Town and Gown. According to Caruso, the next phase in the presidential search process will involve “lots of networking and searching” for potential candidates.
The search will remain confidential due to the “sensitivity” of finding the right candidate. Two higher education recruitment firms — Isaacson Miller and Heidrick & Struggles — will aid in the search and advise the Board to guarantee “the broadest landscape” of potential leaders to serve USC, Caruso said.

Over the weekend, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team emerged victorious after competing in the Aggie RoundUp in Davis, Calif. The Trojans competed in four consecutive matches  facing two top-10 opponents for the first time, kicking off a strong of victories. 
The Aggie RoundUp began with the Trojans facing No. 7 UC Santa Barbara. The morning matchup opened with back-to-back blasts from USC senior driver Zach D’Sa and sophomore driver Jacob Mercep each scoring 2 goals apiece, before UCSB answered back with 2 of their own to lock up the score 2-2. Ultimately, the Trojans dominated the game with a 10-3 win.
USC continued its momentum with another victory against host No. 8 UC Davis, delivering a 16-9 win. Ten different Trojans added to the scoreboard, fueling the lead against Davis. Freshman driver Hannes Daube added a hat trick while redshirt driver Daniel Leong, two-meter junior Matt Maier, Mercep and D’Sa recorded 2 points apiece. 
Saturday’s wins bolstered the Trojans’ start to a 9-0 overall record. 
The Trojans powered through the next day, beating Whittier College 13-2 and Fresno Pacific 13-3 to finish out the Aggie RoundUp. USC scored the first 9 goals of the matchup against Whittier, dominating the match with a 9-0 halftime lead before the Poets broke through twice in the third frame. Two-meter redshirt junior Sam Slobodien and Maier racked up a combined 5 goals. Leong added to the scoreboard in the final minutes of the game, knocking in a pair of goals in the fourth while the defense clamped down on Whittier.
The Poets were held scoreless in the first, second and fourth frames of the 13-2 win, which marked the 10th win of the year for the Trojans. 
An important asset to the Trojans’ victories this weekend was sophomore goalie Vaios Vlahotasios, who gathered nine saves in his first complete-game effort as a Trojan. 
In the second and final game of the day, the Trojans dominated against Fresno Pacific. USC’s powerhouse defense shut out Fresno Pacific for 20 minutes, entering the fourth period with an 11-2 advantage. Eight different Trojans combined for those 11 goals, with sophomore driver Marko Vavic, junior driver Marin Dasic and Leong each delivering a pair.
As USC wrapped up the event, the 12th and 13th  scores for the day came from sophomore driver Christian Hockenbury and freshmen utility Alexander Lansill, ending the game with a 13-3 win over the Sunbirds.
The No. 1-ranked Trojans return home to Uytengsu Aquatics Center for a single home game against Pacific at 1 p.m. on Sept. 22.
