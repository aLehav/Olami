Tuesday afternoon, I witnessed the sloppiest inning of baseball ever.
Baseball is a game of failure. The winner of a matchup is decided by the team that can capitalize on those failures. And that’s how UC Santa Barbara beat USC on Tuesday. 
In a 4-10 win, the game was decided in a half of one inning: The bottom of the fourth. The box score shows that UCSB plated 5 runs with one error. Though statistically correct, one error is far from the truth. There were four “errors” that weren’t illustrated by the E column on the scoreboard. 
USC entered the bottom of the fourth inning leading 2-1. I was caught by surprise. The Gauchos are a solid, underrated baseball squad, and the Trojans playing them close, let alone leading, is an accomplishment. But my pleasant surprise didn’t last for long.
With one out, Santa Barbara played the equalizer from third on a ground ball to third that ate up senior Brandon Perez — error one. 
A walk put runners on first and second, and a passed ball put both runners in scoring position — error two. 
Then came the documented error — completely unacceptable. A routine ground ball, which would have been the second out, was squandered by freshman first baseman Emilio Rosas losing track of the base — bases loaded.
The ensuing at bat featured a deep fly ball to right field, which could have been the third out, but instead flew over the head of sophomore Jamal O’Guinn. It was a well-hit ball and wouldn’t have been on this list if O’Guinn’s first few steps were backwards. They weren’t. Losing several feet and seconds by taking his initial steps forward, he was beat — error three.
With USC trailing 2-4, head coach Dan Hubbs brought in freshman reliever Carson Lambert. That didn’t help, because pitching wasn’t the problem. At this point, if Perez, freshman catcher Tyler Lozano, Rosas and O’Guinn didn’t make those misplays the inning would be over and tied at 2. Sophomore starter John Beller was doing his job; his fielders let him down.
Lambert’s first batter drove in 2 runs with a double to center field, extending UCSB’s lead to 6-2. 
The final “error” of the inning came on the next at bat. A sacrifice bunt, which didn’t yield a run, was turned into a base hit because Lambert picked up the ball with his glove — error four. You can’t do that. If you pick up a bunt with your glove, the runner is safe. That is one of the most elementary skills drilled into pitchers and catchers during pitcher-catcher practice.
The Trojans left the inning with a key double play that halted the tailspin they were in, but that put a band-aid on a bullet wound. 
Big innings like this lose baseball games. Errors and misplays will happen; it’s baseball. The best teams find ways to mitigate errors from developing into innings like this. The score often becomes irreparable and the team morale takes a massive hit. 
The talent and ability of this team is more than solid, but it lacks serious discipline. Someone needs to take action, step up and regroup USC. It doesn’t matter if it’s the coaching staff or a player; someone needs to say, “That’s behind us, move forward and let’s get out of this.” That would be the motto for innings like these and the season as a whole.
Looking down the stretch for USC, it is playing some tough competition. This weekend the Trojans face No. 7 Arizona State and will round out the season with No. 2 Stanford and No. 6 Oregon State. 
What do all of these teams have in common? They will all annihilate USC if the Trojans continue to play this sloppy. Winning teams take advantage of messy teams. 
Right now, USC baseball is a hot mess.

After Stanford snapped USC’s 36-game win streak last weekend, the No. 2 Trojans look to recover in Berkeley this Saturday when they face No. 5 Cal.
Although the Trojans have defeated the Golden Bears in their last 18 meetings, Cal’s recent performance suggests they will put up a fight this weekend. The Bears are 13-4 on the season and are looking ahead for a conference win following their 5-6 loss to Hawaii this past weekend.
Despite their dominant start to the season, the Trojans relinquished their spot on top of the NCAA rankings after losing to Stanford. Although USC was in command for much of the game, the Cardinal outscored them 4-1 in the fourth period to force overtime.
“We really need to improve our 5-on-6 defense and our defensive fast break,” sophomore driver Paige Hauschild said. “That’s how [Stanford] got several of their goals at the end. Those two things were our two major takeaways for when we play Cal because they’re also a really fast team and a really talented team with some good shooters.”
The Stanford game was not the first time USC entered the final minutes of a game with a substantial lead that was threatened by its opponent. When they last faced Cal at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational in February, the Trojans amassed a three-goal lead with just five minutes left, but Cal mounted the pressure by scoring two late goals. Given Cal’s ability to come back late in games, it is important that the Trojans do not become complacent if they have a lead this Saturday.
Cal’s top scoring threat is junior attacker Emma Wright, who sits at second in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation with 2.86 goals per game this season. Despite Wright’s impressive scoring numbers, Cal ranks fourth out of the seven MPSF teams in goals scored per game with 10.71. In comparison, the Trojan offense averages 14.38 goals per game. Regardless, USC’s senior goalie Amanda Longan, the MPSF leader in both goals and saves, must deliver a peak performance this Saturday to silence Wright and Cal’s offense.
“I think a big thing for us is just shutting down their key players,” Hauschild said. “[We need to force] some of their less experienced players to score their goals and put them in scoring situations.”
Cal has also struggled with limiting its opponents’ scoring opportunities. Its defense concedes an average of 8.65 goals per game, compared to the 4.14 goals on average the Trojans allowed on defense. Cal’s susceptibility on defense has resulted in several close contests this season, and is an area the Trojans must take advantage of to be successful this weekend.
“We’re a really fast team, and we have a ton of really good shooters, so we need to push our counterattack more,” Hauschild said. “That’s something that I thought we did [really well] against Hawaii, and we could have done a lot better versus Stanford. I think that pushing the counterattack will be a big thing for us in trying to get one-on-nobody opportunities.”
The Trojans will play Cal Saturday at 1:30 p.m. in Berkeley. Following this game, the Trojans will have just two more conference matches before the postseason.
“The rest of the season, it’s getting down to the line,” Hauschild said. “We just want to go into NCAAs with the highest ranking we can, so it gives us the best opportunities in NCAAs. And [we want to] obviously just win the national championship.”

After three weeks of practice to kick off the road to the 2019 college football season, the Trojans’ efforts for the past two months will culminate in the Spring Showcase on Saturday. The Showcase won’t take on the traditional form of the full-length Spring Game that teams across the country will participate in; instead, it’ll be run like a normal practice session, with large scrimmage stretches interspersed throughout the day. 
Saturday will be the last day the Trojans take the field until fall camp begins in three months, which means that this gives players embroiled in position battles the opportunity to leave a lasting impression.
Offense
More likely than not, the most anticipated part of Saturday’s showcase will be the status of offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s newly implemented air-raid offense. As one of the largest shifts in USC’s offensive philosophy in decades, Harrell’s system offers the promise of opening up the Trojan offense and maximizing the skills of the athletes. It seems as though after a few weeks of training, the team has made impressive strides in adapting to the air raid — especially from the skill positions and offensive linemen.
Veteran receivers junior Michael Pittman and redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns have made a smooth transition, and freshmen Amon-Ra St. Brown and Devon Williams seem poised to excel under Harrell as well. 
Perhaps the most interesting offensive position to keep an eye on will be tight end — a position that’s been largely neglected by the offense. This showcase can lend more insight into how Harrell involves tight ends, as he tends to include them far more than other USC offensive coordinators have in the past. It’ll be worth keeping an eye out for sophomore Josh Falo, sophomore Erik Kroemmenhoek and freshman Jude Wolfe during the showcase to see how many plays are designed for them.
 The offensive line might just be the unit that that’s acclimated best to the new style of play so far. Led by sophomore left tackle Austin Jackson, the unit has gelled quickly despite the shuffling of faces from the end of last season. There’s been an improvement of footwork, fluidity and the much-needed reduction of penalties. Freshman Justin Dedich, redshirt freshman Jalen McKenzie and redshirt freshman Alijah Vera-Tucker are names to watch going into Saturday as they try to establish their spots on this year’s new look line.
The position group that will draw the attention of most on Saturday will be the quarterbacks. Harrell has declared the quarterback position an open competition, though freshman JT Daniels has continued to take the majority of first-team reps in practice. 
Altogether, the group of signal callers has been relatively unspectacular throughout spring ball. Even though the air-raid is meant to simplify the offense for quarterbacks, that’s not all that surprising. Learning and implementing a new offense within three weeks with limited snaps will always pose issues for quarterbacks. 
Daniels, redshirt freshman Jack Sears and redshirt sophomore Matt Fink have all had good and bad days, alternating between them from one practice to the next. The surprise of the group has undoubtedly been Kedon Slovis, the incoming freshman who has been practicing with the team as an early enrollee. 
Despite his status as a newcomer and the expectation that he’d be stuck at fourth on the depth chart, Slovis has been composed and efficient in his opportunities, showcasing impressive accuracy and a natural knack for air-raid offense timing. Saturday is an opportunity for any of the four quarterbacks to leave a favorable impression before fall camp.
Defense
The other side of the ball will also have its fair share of storylines worth watching, even if ESPN’s coverage of the Showcase Saturday glosses over them. With the loss of four of its stalwarts and arguably best players to the NFL Draft, the unit will look drastically different from its predecessor. 
Gone is Porter Gustin’s predatory edge-rusher position as a permanent mainstay. It’ll now be relegated to a sub-package option as the Trojans run more of a traditional 3-4 front. With that change, redshirt junior defensive lineman Christian Rector now mans a starting role as a three-technique.
The linebacking corps seems to be coping well to the losses of Gustin and Cam Smith, with redshirt junior John Houston stepping up to handle Smith’s vacated responsibilities as the quarterback of the defense at middle linebacker. Palaie Gaoteote has been a force as an outside linebacker, and the rising sophomore figures to be one of the unit’s most dominant players going forward. 
A bevy of young pass-rushers have been rotating at the other linebacker spots. Freshman early-enrollee Drake Jackson has shown flashes of potential to step up, as have the more experienced redshirt freshman Hunter Echols and freshman Abdul-Malik McClain.
By far the biggest makeover on the team will be in the secondary, where the team has lost three of its primary starters from last year. Freshman cornerback Isaac Taylor-Stuart has taken huge strides from last season where he barely touched the field, providing the defense with a prototypical frame with freak athleticism on the boundary. He continues to clean up his technique and footwork, but the improvement he’s made has already been enough to make him one of the starters at corner. 
Freshman cornerback Chase Williams has also been impressive, finding a way to make an impact from anywhere on the field. At safety, redshirt freshman Isaiah Pola-Mao has taken over the leadership role of the secondary, backing it up with impressive play on the defense’s posterior. Pola-Mao’s impressive start to the 2018 season was cut short by injury, though he’s managed to work on his game despite the hinderance. His presence in the back of the secondary has been stable all spring long, and when his talented battering-mate at safety, freshman Talanoa Hufanga, returns from a collarbone injury in time for fall camp, they could form a ferocious duo.
 Also deserving of a shoutout is early-enrollee safety Briton Allen, who’s demonstrated a sense of tenacity that could provide a major impact when he starts to harness it effectively. The young crop of defensive backs will be tested heavily in the upcoming season. Their progression as a unit will be one of the most critical storylines to follow over the course of the offseason.

Lorde. Troye Sivan. And now, Billie Eilish. Every few album cycles, a new indie pop artist emerges to shake up the industry in unforeseen ways.
With “Pure Heroine,” Lorde managed to encapsulate the angst of youth in the digital age in a razor-sharp and uniquely accessible sound. Her immaculate debut stands out as one of the strongest pop albums of our age. Troye Sivan’s debut saw similar success. “Blue Neighbourhood” took on a direction that little to no pop albums had attempted before, telling the bittersweet story of growing up gay in a small town. Sivan’s follow-up, last year’s “Bloom,” only further solidified him as a singular force telling important and often overlooked stories. 
Seemingly out of nowhere, Los Angeles native Billie Eilish broke onto the scene. Her first single “Ocean Eyes” was a haunting look into love, showcasing the sound she and her producer and brother Finneas would continue to master over the next few years. 
Eilish’s debut EP “Don’t Smile at Me” thereafter sparked the attention of industry executives and consumers around the globe. Assisted by prominent features from rap star Vince Staples and R&B juggernaut Khalid, Eilish was able to create a blueprint that labels scrambled to jump on. 
After a development period, tour and months in the studio, Eilish returned with her official debut album “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” The 14-track record was crafted to build upon the foundation set by “Don’t Smile at Me.” Like “Pure Heroine” and “Blue Neighbourhood,” the record is one of the strongest debuts of the decade.
Dark, vulnerable and filled to the brim with angst, Eilish’s project is nothing short of an exciting roller coaster. It often leaves listeners disoriented, moved to tears and thrashing in their chairs. 
The record cultivates a dark atmosphere, and its innovation as a pop album lays in its depth. Eilish sings vulnerably about certain relationships, while scoffing playfully at others. While not every track stands out, every additional listen reveals hidden pockets in production and lyrical subtext. It serves as a perfect introduction to an artist that many may not have heard before.
Beginning with the radio-ready “Bad Guy,” the album explores Eilish’s own perception of her public image. She quips lethargically, “I’m a bad guy, duh.” This track, and the few that follow, show listeners how she intends to be perceived — punk, careless and empowered. 
It isn’t until the middle act that Eilish begins to peel back the onion. On “When the Party’s Over,” she laments a lost love, maintaining the electro-pop sound of the earlier tracks while catering to the song’s emotional lyrics and vocal performance. Finneas complements Eilish’s style, sprinkling production stems that can’t go unnoticed.
Eilish revives her seductive dark side later on “My Strange Addiction,” which samples audio from “The Office” before diving deeper into her emotion. Like a sleep cycle, there is a back-and-forth nature to the tone throughout the record. Where this may be a drawback to pop albums of this capacity, it works for the theme of “When We All Fall Asleep.” 
Her personality and sound is what makes Eilish stand out in the oversaturated market of contemporary pop music. Distinguishable from the rest, Eilish is able to approach her art in a vulnerable way while maintaining a grit and playfulness that many artists of her generation lack. She represents the latest wave of conscious pop, giving her youthful audience an outlet for their unpredictable moodiness and the anxieties of the stress-inducing social climate today.
Billie Eilish has risen, and she’s brought the dead along with her. “When We All Fall Asleep” is, indeed, a bop.

Every year since 2013, the popular music program at USC has put on a showcase for its graduating seniors to perform their creations from the past four years before they venture off into the music industry.  The program founding director Chris Sampson told the Daily Trojan that the purpose is not only to provide a culminating experience and celebrate the musicians’ accomplishments, but also to showcase the artists’ talents to industry executives who attend the show. Students also work on a final project throughout their senior year that gives them some momentum going into their post-graduate careers. While the free showcase used to take place at the Troubadour, a symbolic bastion of underground talent in Los Angeles, because the event has since outgrown the space, it is now hosting the soon-to-be graduates on stage at El Rey Theatre. Below, read about the seniors’ music, where they get their influences, what they plan to do after graduation and what they’ll be performing at the showcase Friday night. 
Ben Mironer 
With a sound that is “a cross between Jeff Buckley, Arctic Monkeys and Radiohead,” popular music performance major Ben Mironer will play “The Jackie Song” and “The City” during his showcase performance. On the side, Mironer has done gigs for an electronic project called Big Yeti, featuring “trap and bass house and a bunch of remixes.” 
After graduating from the program with a focus in piano performances, Mironer plans to take some time off and travel, either around California or abroad. After that, the senior plans to move in with some friends in Highland Park, continue to create music, perform for his live band and give kids production lessons.  
As for the showcase, Mironer says he’s just excited to see all his fellow popular music performance majors perform after all this time, especially since he doesn’t see all of them on a regular basis anymore. When he recently rehearsed with peer Caroline Hisel, Mironer said he could hear a throughline in her sound from what he remembered, but was blown away by the level of development Hisel has had over the past four years. 
Mica Nafshun-Bone
Senior Mica Nafshun-Bone began taking violin lessons when she was six years old. Sick of the classical box she was always restricted to, Nafshun-Bone took up the after-school program String Project Los Angeles, where she learned how to improvise and play popular songs on violin. 
“I think it’s safe to say I’d fall under the indie category,” Nafshun-Bone said. 
Planning to release music soon for the first time, Nafshun-Bone takes inspiration from artists like Andrew Bird and has been consistently influenced by The Beatles throughout her entire musical career. She’s been mentored by various Thornton faculty, including assistant professor Sean Holt, who’s been walking Nafshun-Bone through the EP process for her final project within the program. 
After graduating this May, Nafshun-Bone plans to take a year off from school and write some scores in preparation for applying to USC’s screen scoring program, as she  hopes to eventually compose for films and video games. 
Friday’s showcase, Nafshun-Bone is playing her songs “Too Soon” and “No More Darkness” and will be backed by cello, cajón and background singers. On the latter song, Nafshun-Bone will be playing violin and singing lead vocals at the same time. 
Mallory Hauser
Even though she’s played guitar most of her life, Mallory Hauser never considered herself a lead guitarist. After entering the program, she has not only emerged as the lead guitarist in a few different projects, but has also learned to produce, write arrangements, compose and score. 
“I didn’t play with anybody until my senior year in high school,” Hauser said. “I knew that I really wanted to make it in music and I didn’t grow up playing jazz guitar or classical guitar. [The] pop program, to me … felt like my only option.”
Taking influence from artists like George Harrison, Ben Howard and Blake Mills, Hauser gravitates toward a “songwriter folk [sound] with indie influences.” Throughout the last four years, Hauser said she’s learned how to harness her emotions in her music. 
“Every note you play ideally would come from a certain place of pure and raw emotion,” Hauser said.
After graduation, Hauser plans to go on tour with peer Michael Gordon’s project Mk.Gee, but said she would love to compose for films or TV further into the future while continuing to play live on the side.
Tonight, Hauser will play original songs “Wildflowers” and potentially “Breaking Up From a Bad Dream,” but she has not yet decided whether she will play both. 
Hannah McCarthy
An indie rock artist with “a little riot grrrl punk,” Hannah McCarthy, a popular music major with a voice concentration, draws influence from modern guitar rockers like Cherry Glazerr as well as older singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell with a dose of ’60s psychedelic rock for good measure. 
Releasing music under stage name Irene Greene, McCarthy said she writes a lot about women’s issues and women that inspire her. One of her showcase songs, “1967,” comes directly from an original poem by her grandmother. Her other showcase song, “Nancy,” is inspired by McCarthy’s critiques of misogyny in old horror films and gets its namesake from the famous character from “A Nightmare on Elm Street.” 
This summer, McCarthy and her friend Mason Summit are planning a tour up the California coast and potentially in Nashville as well. She’s also working on an EP (with working title “Nancy”) that will likely drop in the fall. 
Tiah Barnes
Fusing hip-hop, R&B, funk and influences from artists like Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu, senior Tiah Barnes came into the program as a vocalist, but she said she will be leaving as a full musician with an arsenal of skills to perform well in any setting.
Under the name Tiah Giná, Barnes will release her debut EP later this year. Barnes sees the EP as a culmination of her time in college, as the songs were written as far back to her first summer at USC and as recently as last summer.  
While Barnes will remain in Los Angeles working on music once she graduates, if nothing is holding her here once August comes around, she said she wants to get involved in performing on cruise ships so she can perform regularly while also traveling the world. 
Barnes will perform her songs “Time” and “L.A Paid” with a full band of almost 20 people at the El Rey Friday.
Jessi Mason
An indie rock singer-songwriter, Jessi Mason released her first EP “Hollow” while she was still in high school. Mason said she looks for inspiration in artists like Margaret Glaspy and Joni Mitchell, as well as indie-rocker Soccer Mommy and songwriting legend Paul Simon.
One of Mason’s biggest takeaways from the pop program was the experience of collaborating and co-writing with other musicians. On top of that, her sound has shifted and developed since she’s been in school. She said her upcoming songs live in the realm of indie rock, while her most recent project “Night Owl” had some country influence.
Though she is still trying to decide whether she’ll live in New York or LA after graduation, Mason said she’s committed to continuing to write, tour and collaborate. At the El Rey, Mason is breaking out two new cuts titled “When It Rains in LA” and “Queen of the Andes.”
Cooper Holzman
Growing up in Hood River, Ore., Cooper Holzman said he was one of the biggest musicians in the area, which gave him some overconfidence coming into USC. 
“I came in thinking I was like the best musician ever,” Holzman said. “Now I realize I’m definitely not, but I’m also a lot better than I was.”
Concentrating in piano performance, Cooper produces and plays what he describes as pop and indie underground pop music. Whereas his influences originally came from metal and transitioned into bands like Twenty One Pilots, now they are mainly Top 40 pop performers like Ariana Grande and Troye Sivan. In the showcase, Holzman will be playing two songs — “River” and “Boat Song” — with his band Chec, which he started in high school with his best friend. 
As for his impending graduation, Holzman said he doesn’t see it as that a huge transition — he’s been in the program for four years and now he’s going to go out into the world and keep doing what he’s been doing.
Nyallah Noah
An R&B and soul artist who’s unafraid to sing about the racial dynamics at play within her life, Nyallah Noah recently released an EP under the name Nyallah titled “Reflections,” a self-affirmational project that she wanted to be like a sonic healing.” She takes influence from socially conscious rappers like Mos Def, A Tribe Called Quest and NoName, as well as R&B artists like Mary J. Blige.
Noah used to curate “Loft Sessions,” an event series that highlighted musicians of color, which she’d like to bring back soon with a focus more specifically on queer and femme people of color. 
At the El Rey, Noah will perform a song off “Reflections” called “Do U Remember?” as well as the unreleased track “Of You, For Me.” 
Abby Hwong
An indie, atmospheric songwriter who takes influence from Big Thief and Ben Howard, Abby Hwong said her songwriting has improved immensely by taking a visual arts class with professor Helen Kim, as it made her think more analytically about her music. 
Hwong started writing music in high school under the stage name NoSo and has released four singles. On Friday, she will be playing two of those songs: “Allie” and “Summer.” 
Leaving USC, Hwong looks forward to making music her sole focus while living in L.A.
“I’ll have more time to tour and that kind of stuff … as opposed to worrying about GEs,” Hwong said. “I just want to make a living doing it.”
Caroline Hisel
Playing alternative rock with a dose of country influence, Caroline Hisel previously released an album with her band Common Ground, but she will soon drop her debut solo EP. After passing through the popular music program, Hisel said she looks at the bigger picture of music creation now — “as opposed to ‘what am I gonna do?’” Hisel said, “It’s ‘how are we gonna fit together?’” 
Hisel will perform her songs “Follow the Leader” and “I’m Not Enough.” The former is about politics and President Donald Trump, Hisel said, while the latter is about “being in a relationship and not feeling like you’re good enough for the other person.”
After graduating, Hisel wants to keep making music, and eventually get to the point where she can support herself solely off her work.
Nick Stone
A member of the pop-funk band Undecided Future, Nick Stone draws sounds from anywhere, from Anderson .Paak to Earth, Wind & Fire to Bruno Mars. Working with producer Dem Jointz, the group is in the middle of a project with the working title “Look Up!” which they will likely release songs from over the summer. 
Stone is currently setting up a San Diego and Los Angeles tour as his final project in the popular music program, a task his faculty mentor Nick Stubis has been especially helpful with, Stone said. 
Tonight at the El Rey, Stone and his band will play their song “Bouncin” off their LP and a new song, “Look Up!”
Jensen McRae
A “folk-soul-pop” singer, Jensen McRae said that she’s no longer writing simple love songs — throughout her four years at Thornton, she said her lyrics have become more vulnerable and multi-faceted, and she’s chosen to write more about mental health and politics instead. 
While McRae already has an EP out called “Milkshakes,” she’s currently writing and recording her first full-length album and plans to finish it this summer. 
In tonight’s showcase, McRae will play her songs “White Boy” and “Belt.”
Michael Gordon
Michael Gordon has released two LPs under the moniker Mk.Gee, and will be going on tour with his band following graduation. 
“I grew up on a lot of jazz and there are a lot of amazing colors that can come out of that,” Gordon said in a November 2017 Q&A with the Daily Trojan.

A few weeks ago, USC Board of Trustees chairman Rick Caruso, chairman, disclosed the names of the voting members of the Board’s Executive Committee to the Daily Trojan. Until then, their identities had been kept secret. Most students had only heard of the members through the various buildings and schools named after them scattered throughout campus — Ronald Tutor, Wallis Annenberg, David Dornsife.
It was shocking that Caruso decided to reveal the names of the Executive Committee even amid the newfound effort for transparency. This decision was made right in the middle of the University’s involvement in the largest college admissions bribery scandal ever prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice. But also, perhaps one of the biggest shocks was that the reveal confirmed what most students already knew — USC is truly run by white people. Specifically, white men.
In many ways, this revelation was still unexpected. Honestly, it would be more remarkable if an executive committee of any governmental or educational institution was not led by a majority of white men. This country and the systems which run within it are still governed by the same people who have always governed the laws of the land. But as we reach a turning point and as more voices are demanding to be heard, this old way of representation has proven to not be a true or reliable voice in a diverse, modern-day society. 
At USC, the Board of Trustees’ Executive Committee is responsible for voting on some of the University’s most important issues and, for the most part, holds the same power as the Board. According to documents obtained by the Daily Trojan, the voting committee comprises 14 men and only three women; six venture capitalists, five real estate moguls, one oil tycoon, one educator, one philanthropist, one leader in health and one in communication. Most of the 17 members are white.
To the credit of the many accomplished men on the committee, no one is saying that rich, old white men cannot be the voices of a diverse student body. But even Ben & Jerry’s — yes, the ice cream company — states that “when white people occupy most positions of decision-making power, people of color have a difficult time getting a fair shake, let alone getting ahead.” 
And, as a University that prides itself on the various backgrounds of all those who attend it, USC must make an equal effort to ensure the names inside the brochures represent the faces of the students chosen to be on the outside. This would show students and faculty that the University cares and is serious about listening to the various cultural issues around the campus. Students will be confident that there are representatives who can understand the unique perspectives that make up this campus.
“Every committee should be transparent,” Caruso said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.  “How can you serve people if they don’t know who you are?”
However, the unmasking of those who “serve the people” and seeing that one of the most powerful committees at the University severely lacks the diversity of both race and gender makes one question whether USC cares about making an effort to change the representation within its own institution or whether they truly care about minority input at all. 
There is no reason to have a nearly all-white executive board, especially one whose voices comprise mostly men. If anything, it only shows that the opinions and perspectives the University is trying to hear are only those of rich white men. There is no need for minority students to feel as if, institutionally, there is no space for the people who look like them. 
If the University is to keep the executive committee this way, at least tell everyone why. If not, then, as the University begins a new chapter and attempts to correct some mishaps in its legacy, any executive committee whose job is to vote on the issues of this school — this school whose student population comprises of 16.5% Asians, 5.6% Black/African Americans, 14.8% Hispanics, 30.7% White/Caucasians and 23.9% international students — should be representative of the population it is voting for and discussing on behalf of.
Though changing the racial makeup of the Board will probably not help address the systematic corruption at USC, it will be a step in the right direction in changing the voices who are heard and the experiences that are understood at an institutional level. There are a plethora of wealthy, charitable Asian Americans, African Americans and Latinx Americans that the University could add to the committee if it so desired.
For example, Dr. Dre has a school and a building in his name, too. And with a net worth of $850 million, what makes him different than any of the others deemed worthy of a spot on the Board? 
What, is it because he’s not a billionaire?

Town and Gown Hall traveled into the future for several hours on Thursday as Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti talked about the city’s plans to completely eliminate emissions within several decades, while guests ate a plant-based lunch and sipped from compostable cups. The air of optimism at the all-day conference, “Climate Forward: The Politics of Climate Change” at USC, was palpable.
Nearly 150 people attended the Global Action panel, moderated by Steven Lamy, director of the Dornsife Task Force for Global and Political Studies. Four panelists who took the stage, including Gordon Brown, former prime minister of the United Kingdom; Ambassador of Mexico to Austria Luis Alfonso de Alba; Terry Tamminem, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation; and Mario Molina, recipient of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
The panel focused on the threat posed by global temperature rises. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that with current greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures will rise between 2.5 and 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.
The panelists touched on a plethora of topics, including the rise of the global middle class, air quality and how to cut 50% of global carbon emissions in half by 2030. Brown emphasized the need for governments around the world to inform the public about the climate crisis. The panelists spoke positively about the future of global climate, even as they and audience members raised questions about the challenges of preserving safety and health in the coming years.
“What more do we actually need to make that safety net for the planet that can sustain 10 billion people and a biodiverse world by 2050?” Tamminem said. “It’s all very possible. Ambitious, but possible.”
When Lamy opened up the floor to questions, Kelley Xuereb, a sophomore majoring in international relations, global business and environmental studies, asked the panelists about the ways climate change disproportionately affects the Southern Hemisphere. According to a 2017 study from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, climate change will cause the number of people migrating to the European Union to triple by the year 2100.
“How can we navigate this disparity, the ways that burdens are shared and the increase in migrants by using the international system?” she asked the panelists.
Xuereb said she is currently taking a class on the politics of the global environment, which has exposed her to the political side of the climate crisis.
“I have always loved politics and the environment and finding ways to find the intersection between the two is something that I’m really interested in,” Xuereb said.
In response to Xuereb, de Alba said the majority of countries do not want to be considered victims in a such as massive, inevitable problem.
“We’ve focused too much on mitigation and not enough on adaptation,” De Alba said.
Like Xuereb, many other students attended to see how their interests could play into the global solutions for climate change. 
Ankur Rastogi, a senior majoring in computer science, was one of those students. He explained he was drawn to the event because he believes that engineering can be better incorporated into the effort to battle climate change.
“There’s an environmental engineering major in [the Viterbi School of Engineering], but for a lot of other groups, it’s a distant and kind of hazy thing to think about,” Rastogi said. “So I was really excited to learn that the conference was happening because it seemed like an opportunity to …  dive into how people are tackling the problem in a really tangible way.”

A team of students in the Viterbi School of Engineering have taken one small step toward space and made one big leap for their careers. 
Early in March, these students finished building and delivered USC’s third CubeSat satellite, which is about the size of a breadbox. David Barnhart, a research professor in the astronautics department, led the students selected from the Space Engineering Research Center through the year-long building process of the satellite.
The team has successfully delivered the satellite to its customer, Vector Space Systems, a start-up developing satellites and launch vehicles. Vector will use this newly built satellite to test its technology in space and ensure it works before selling it to customers.
“It’s definitely a huge success because we’ve spent the past year or so working on this and we’ve been able to start from pretty much nothing and create a CubeSat that’s ready to go to space,” said Rahul Rughani, a doctoral student and systems engineer for the team.
The CubeSat satellite will be used for technology development, testing the company’s payload when sent to space. Once in orbit, the satellite will generate power and send a signal to the ground, indicating that everything is functional. The customer’s payload will then send data to Vector, while the satellite’s sensors simultaneously send information to the ground to ensure everything is operating as expected.
“Size matters in space relative to payloads and power and things so it can’t do a lot by itself but … we provide a platform, in essence, to carry their electronic boards to validate that they work,” Barnhart said.
Rebecca Rogers, the team’s integration and test director, said this was a rare opportunity for students to have an internship-like experience before entering the workforce.
“It feels like a big accomplishment to send something that actually will get launched into space and being able to take a lot of the theoretical knowledge that we’ve gained and turn it into an actual product that will send data back down from space to Earth,” said Rogers, who graduated from USC’s graduate astronautical engineering program last May. “I think it turns a lot of what our dreams were into reality.”
Rughani said working on the satellite allowed students to apply the skills they’ve learned in classes and solve real-world problems.
“We learn about this in classes but applying it to actual hardware is very different,” Rughani said. “The hardware doesn’t always cooperate with you unlike a simulation on a computer. And then, you run into things that you wouldn’t even think about when you’re designing.” 
Rogers said creating the satellite allowed her to gain experience and discover her career aspirations in different aspects of engineering. 
“I just think that was really valuable for me to just get experience in all these different things and [see what] a job in any one of these subsystems [could] be like day to day,” Rogers said.
