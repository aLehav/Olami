On Jan. 5, the Provost’s office published a letter announcing the reorganization of the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund. The letter’s primary point was the removal of the Fund’s program director, a role that Christina Yokoyama has served for the past 11 years.
We, the collective, represent over 40 years of leadership within the NTSAF. In each of our respective tenures we occupied the role of governing board chair. As a nominated position, we had the distinct responsibility of being  conduits between the student body and the administration. We were responsible for maintaining the integrity of the student voice — a voice that developed at the very origins of the scholarship in 1972.
In evaluating the core mission of the NTSAF, which is to diversify the once homogenous student body, there is a narrative that speaks to more than just changing student demographics. The central tenet of the fund, as outlined in the original constitution, is to select scholars not only based on their demographic indicators but because they have demonstrated a high level of community awareness, often in spite of extraordinary circumstances. 
This selection criteria serves as a unique marker that distinguishes Topping Scholars from the larger group of first-generation low-income students. The result is a highly capable, but volatile, cohort of at-risk students. Historically and statistically, these students have beat the odds to even be eligible for consideration. To believe the NTSAF’s primary responsibility is to provide tuition support is to severely underestimate the implications of being a first-generation low-income student pursuing a post-secondary education.
In singling out just one class of scholars, the NTSAF boasts  graduated students who have now become doctors, lawyers, politicians and community leaders; the result is a homegrown team of advocates who not only have the insights of their diverse early experiences, experiences often marked by trauma and unmeasurable persistence, but who also have the polished degrees of a globally recognized University. As an institution, these students are the best you can hope to produce. But they did not start that way. These are the same students each of us have seen stumble into Yokoyama’s office unable to find their footing on campus. As a first-generation student, it is easy to believe you do not belong in the classrooms you find yourself in. It is easy to convince yourself that the specific details of your story somehow rule you out. 
We sat in the Topping Office on countless occasions, listening to students process the loss of family members to violence or the struggle to be the primary provider for their household. Not only were these students expected to successfully process these experiences, but at the same time they were also adjusting to the rigors of college coursework, creating an entirely new social network and learning how to navigate a foreign system. 
In light of all of this, it should not be surprising that Topping Scholars often walk into the office exhausted. But Yokoyama has always been ready to receive them. Had she not had a chair in front of her desk that students could collapse into, they likely would not have found a safe place to collapse at all. This is the heart of the NTSAF and this is what is at stake with the proposed reorganization.
Beyond the anecdotal evidence this group can document, the landmark research in the area of student success clearly points out the defining features of student-centered programming for first-generation low-income students. Although financial resources are necessary, they are not paramount to the social and emotional support needed to build the fundamental belief that a student can both attend and thrive in college. The post-secondary experience for many first-generation students is marked by feelings of doubt and rejection, and an inability to find their place on campus. But the NTSAF has served as home base for hundreds of scholars, allowing them to effectively overcome the feelings of displacement that consume so many non-graduates.
As the University continues to reflect on its changing demographics, its leadership team should think critically about both the civil and social responsibilities inherent in this conversation. A meaningful invitation to prospective students requires anticipating their full set of needs. It means providing both the financial resources to make a degree accessible and a chair in which they can collapse to make a degree attainable.
Beyond the ethical implications, the structure of the fund was established to put the student body at the center of operations. As such, the NTSAF has always reported directly to the nominated Governing Board. The decision to remove the role of Program Director, without the explicit involvement of the governing board, violates the documented agreement. 
Student success is neither a coincidence nor an accident. It is the strategic alignment of resources and support held together by a shared vision. And, as with all visions that come to fruition, it needs a visionary at its helm to lead and direct. Removing the program director position from the NTSAF guts the heart of the program, a program that has accumulated five decades worth of degrees. Yokoyama has not only fulfilled the mission of the scholarship, but has also contributed to the central mission of any post-secondary institution: to produce active scholars that can go forth and meaningfully contribute to the world around them. 
In each of our terms as governing board chair, our primary responsibility has been to protect the integrity of the fund by adhering to its origins as a student-led initiative. We ask that the Provost operate with the same sense of integrity. The NTSAF is a student-funded, student-administered and student-led initiative, yet the decision to reorganize was devoid of any student voice. 
We are requesting a reversal on the decision to remove the program director position, and that senior administration begins to work collaboratively with instead of against the governing board. Jointly, we can create alignment between the historic mission of the scholarship and the current needs of the University without sacrificing the students or program structure we were all put in place to serve.

With the passage of the new Republican tax bill and its myriad consequences for higher education, private universities can no longer insulate themselves from the national political dialogue in the aftermath of the tax code overhaul.
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
USC’s administration, arguably more so than fellow private universities’ administrations, often delves into the policy arena. In addition to releasing memorandums to students regarding issues such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy and attempted international travel bans by President Donald Trump, as well as participating in annual lobbying trips to Capitol Hill, USC’s President C. L. Max Nikias also has written op-eds in national media outlets and employs local, state and federal relationships departments.
Yet this revamping of the tax code will put the resources and will of the University to the test. Though widely unpopular provisions in the original House version of the GOP tax bill — such as the possible taxing of graduate student tuition waivers and allowing student loan borrowers to deduct up to $2,500 paid toward student loan interest from their taxable income each year — failed to manifest themselves in the final 1,000 pages of tax code text, the finished product still poses a threat to private colleges nationwide.
Colleges must now calculate gains and losses for each activity, likely increasing their tax burden due to compliance costs and fewer opportunities to deduct certain losses. Additionally, a 1.4 percent excise tax on the net investment income on endowments will affect a number of private colleges. And, on top of this, doubling of the standard deduction will likely equate to fewer tax itemizations, and thus, fewer donations to universities, as many Americans deduct charitable giving off their tax returns. 
This revision means the pocketbooks of universities around the nation will take a hit when donations that fund scholarships, research and sports programs dry up — and students who rely on these resources will shoulder the burden
Five days before the eventual passage of this landmark legislation, Nikias wrote an opinion piece in The Hill expressing concerns over the bill’s potential effect on the competitiveness of America’s universities. Graduate student organizing efforts across the country, and at USC, culminated in thousands protesting in a highly visible walkout to drop contentious provisions of the bill that would wreak havoc for Ph.D. and master’s students.
And yet, the activism of the national graduate student community has yet to trickle down to undergraduate students. This inaction and apathy among some undergraduates at USC represents a worrying trend, as the threat of taxation spikes on student loan interest  seemed to be met with ignorance, silence and disengagement.
Yet, in light of continued legal jeopardy for DACA recipients, the shrinking of personnel and responsibility at the U.S. Department of Education and the resurrection of another iteration of the travel ban, the threats to current and future students remain stark. In response, all students must take a stand, raise their voices and double down on college affordability and the protection of the most marginalized of student populations. There are many ways for students to mobilize and make change. They must call their representatives, facilitate dialogue and awareness among their peers, sign petitions, participate in rallies and involve themselves in the political process and discourse. With rights and financial security at risk, there is no room for apathy on campus.
Despite how campus protests tend to be associated with public schools appealing for more funds, USC must continue its mission toward establishing itself at the forefront of the national political dialogue. The University must resolve to never falter in fighting for legislation that benefits the student body, and emerge as a cardinal and gold standard of a proactive, private research university. Nothing less than the wellbeing of a campus — and a nation — is at stake.

Anyone well-versed in California history, literary nonfiction, or the early work of physically frail writers from Sacramento has read Joan Didion’s 1967 essay, “Slouching Towards Bethlehem.” In it, Didion paints an urgent portrait of a California in disarray, grappling with, or, rather, reporting on, the pernicious grasp of hippie culture in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco in the 1960s. 
Art by Di Wu | Daily Trojan
But that was over half a century ago. The California of today, though similarly loose and drug-friendly, just affixed a new lapel to its reputation as a haven for the perennially “chill” that may hold us together better than the hippies could: Recreational marijuana is now legal in the state of California. The tumult of 1960s California, fueled by drugs and chronicled by Didion, will not reappear in the California of 2018 so long as a studied coordination persists between every level of law.  
But that may be easier said than done. On Thursday, just the fourth day of recreational marijuana’s legal status in California, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rolled back federal policy from president Obama’s administration that directed federal prosecutors not to prosecute the sale of cannabis in states where it is legal, like California as of this month. 
Put simply, the move is a problematic one — not just because of the changing public perception of marijuana, but also because of the implications that the move sets forth. 
On the university level, Sessions’ decision disrupts communication with government institutions. Cooperation, the kind that works even when two drastically contrasting policies exist simultaneously, should fuel not only the choices of California lawmakers operating under federal law, but also the rules of its reputable universities — this one included. At USC, a microcosm of our national cannabis dilemma exists: As of last year, USC dubbed its indoor and outdoor facilities “smoke-free” but, of course, as of this year, recreational marijuana is legal for students over the age of 21. Once again, larger policy concerning marijuana appears to be at odds with the rules of local — or, in this case University — policy. 
This apparent paradox presents an urgent kind of query in need of a more definitive dictum than can currently be offered: How do we effectively work together when such little basis for our problem exists? Despite being a plant dating back to the Neolithic Age, cannabis’ legality as a recreational drug has a short history in American politics, and, naturally, in USC policy. Hardly a new substance, marijuana instead presents a new problem, one that hints at the circling interplay between powers that has always fueled our political system: Who, exactly, gets to decide what is legal? 
These questions, like all of the best ones, cannot actually be answered. Instead, the University should use the ambiguity of the situation to admit some diffidence in concocting a perfect solution. When this many conflicting rules exist — on a national, state, local and University level — the question of what to do about the conflict no longer rests on offering a definitive answer, but on collaboration and communication sessions. 
Complicating this is marijuana’s ambiguous status as a distinctly criminal substance — which will now rest in the hands of federal prosecutors to a much larger extent than in the Obama era. 
But the policy that Sessions just rescinded, known as the Cole Memo, got it right. The memo encouraged prosecutors to lend their focus only to enterprises concerning cannabis that are actually harmful to the fabric of society, like selling drugs to children or working with criminal gangs, instead of indiscriminately prosecuting any businesses that sell marijuana — such as licensed dispensaries — in a state where marijuana is legal. 
This kind of micro-level focus will be what makes or breaks continued discussion, and consequent legislation, concerning marijuana under Sessions’ federal jurisdiction. His choice has broad and negative implications for his party and for his intended criminalization of marijuana; both are predicted to backfire. What state and local governments can effectively do, then, is to operate cautiously — to operate as though, say, the feds are watching. Even before Sessions’ actions, legalized California took prudent steps as it unveiled its new policy. Since cooperation between state and federal government fuels successful prosecutions, a state’s vigilance in implementing its policy carefully could become the key to that state’s efficiency as well as its freedom when it comes to marijuana. 
In a letter sent to University undergraduates on Monday, reminding students of USC’s smoke and drug policies, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry stated that USC remains smoke — and drug — free “in compliance with federal regulations.” Compliance usually doesn’t work as well as coordination, though. USC would be well-served,  and as would California, to work in coordination rather than blind compliance. After all,  despite what power he has, Sessions squanders some of it when he offers such consistently polarizing statements about marijuana, among them: “Good people don’t smoke marijuana.” 
It’s a pretty easy statement to argue with. Less argument will arise, at USC at least, when we collectively acknowledge the complexities of our competing power structures, and the current setbacks they create when trying to reach a perfect solution to legalizing marijuana.

The involvement fair draws over 800 clubs at USC and takes place over two days. Daily Trojan file photo
 
USC is the proud home of more than 800 student clubs and organizations, and this week they’ll be tabling along Trousdale Parkway for the Involvement Fair — an event that happens  every semester. 
This Wednesday and Thursday, spring admits and returning students will have a chance to learn firsthand about the different clubs at USC and find one that best fits their own interests. Here are just a few of the numerous organizations that USC has to offer:
Music nerds need to check out KXSC, the school’s student-run radio station that gives students the opportunity to DJ their own radio program. Along with curated music shows, the station also broadcasts every Trojan football game as the student radio home of USC Athletics, and runs a blog filled with concert and album reviews to keep readers up to date with the constantly evolving world of music.
Other arts-related groups will be featured at the involvement fair, such as UnderSCore, one of the premiere a capella groups on campus. UnderSCore just released its debut EP “Punctuation” last August, and the group can often be seen singing at various venues and coffee shops in the USC area. 
Nicolas Zhou, UnderSCore’s president and a sophomore studying Business and Cinematic Arts, said the tight bond he’s formed with the rest of the group has helped define his college experience.
“Every individual in the group is extremely unique in terms of their personality, life goals and music taste yet still manage to become really close,” Zhao said. “We all have crazy schedules but we still manage to prioritize this group and create quality music. Joining UnderSCore gives you an insanely talented second family that you honestly won’t find anywhere else.”
For those with the urge to explore the outdoors, there are  several groups with a passion for hiking and  nature. SC Outfitters hosts camping trips and excursions throughout the semester, traveling to places like Catalina, Morro Bay and Yosemite. 
All students are welcome to join the Outfitters for whatever adventure sounds the most appealing, or can apply to serve as a trip guide and play a larger role in creating memories for the club.
Along with SC Outfitters, Peaks & Professors is one of the most popular outdoors groups for students. In addition to wandering through the wilderness, the organization gives students the chance to form closer bonds with their professors outside the classroom, on exciting trips to the Mojave Desert as well as an upcoming backpacking trip in Red Rock Country through Nevada, Arizona and Utah.
Peaks & Professors welcomes adventurers of all skill levels.

For Louisa Dai, a sophomore majoring in human biology, seeing newcomers fall in love with the outdoors is one of his favorite aspects of being in the club.
“Something that stands out to me was hearing from a participant that going on their first ever backpacking trip with Peaks to Death Valley was what gave her the experience and confidence to go camping and backpacking on her own,” Dai  said. “She’d never had much experience with hiking or camping growing up, but Peaks helped expose her to the outdoors and now it’s something she enjoys doing all the time.”
Of course, a school with an athletic history as illustrious as that of USC wouldn’t be complete without opportunities for students to get active on the field or the court. 
Intramurals and club teams are available for players of all skill levels, each with varying levels of competitiveness. Flag football, basketball and volleyball are some of the most popular sports for students to join, but more niche pastimes like climbing, martial arts and even Quidditch always draw eager crowds.
For those who wish to combine their love of sports with a good cause, Kicks for Kids has built a reputation for giving back to the community through  participation in sports. 
Designed to empower kids with special needs and provide encouragement for them and their families, the organization gives students the opportunity to work directly with local youth and make a difference in their lives. 
For Amanda Cawley, a sophomore studying health and human sciences, the laid-back nature of Kicks for Kids combined with the ability to help youth has made her time in the program worthwhile. 
“Working with the kids gives me the opportunity to be silly and simply play, while also making a positive impact on their childhood and development,” Cawley  said. “Forging connections with individual children and spending weeks fostering that bond is by far my favorite part of the organization.”
These groups and many, many more will be looking for new members this week, and there’s no better way to get more information than talking to them face to face. 
Stop by the Involvement Fair on a break from classes, and prepare to get a taste of the people and clubs that make USC so special.
Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled Nicholas Zhou’s surname. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Laurie Shapiro’s psychedelic installation “Before You Were Born” is on display in West Hollywood through Feb. 3. Photo from Radiant Space.
From ancient paintings to modern multimedia installations, the Los Angeles art scene boasts a wide range of visual wonders, and now 2018 is slated to be another vibrant year for arts and culture. Here is an abbreviated rundown of exhibits — from the indie to the classic  — that are poised to dominate the city’s art scene this coming season.
“Before You Were Born” 
To kick off the new year, mixed media artist Laurie Shapiro’s psychedelic-inspired walk-in installation “Before You Were Born” opened at Radiant Space in West Hollywood. The highlight of the installation is a floor-to-ceiling, interactive textile cave — Shapiro’s signature tapestry-like piece that took her over 1,000 hours to hand-sew and paint. She weaves the two crafts together frequently in her works, which resemble paintings from afar but show the detail in her hand-stitching upon closer inspection. Shapiro’s artwork will be complemented by interactive dance and music performances. The space will also host dance, music, yoga, lectures and myriad public gatherings throughout the month of January. Previously displayed at the San Jose Museum of Quilts and Textiles, “Before You Were Born” will be on display through Feb. 3 and is free and open to all ages. 
“Jasper Johns: Something Resembling Truth” 
Celebrating a prolific, influential artist, The Broad will display over 120 of Jasper Johns’ most iconic works from his six-decade career as a painter, sculptor and printmaker. Since the 1950s, Johns’ art has been engaged in nearly every artistic movement, influencing Dada, Abstract Expressionism and Pop art. Partnering with Louis Vuitton and the Royal Academy of Arts, London, the exhibit will include works from The Broad’s permanent collection as well as works loaned by international public and private collections. The Broad will divide Johns’ artistic life into a series of thematic chapters, but rather than taking a chronological approach common for retrospectives, it will showcase Johns’ achievements by juxtaposing early and late works next to each other. Tickets are available online for $25 and the special exhibition will be on view from Feb. 10 to May 13. 
Museum of Failure 
Originally hailing from downtown Helsingborg, Sweden, the Museum of Failure is an international collection of over 100 failures in innovation throughout human history. With a touch of humor, the museum explores the countless failed prototypes behind every new product, some of which never even made it onto the market. The exhibits, hosted at the landmark A+D Architecture and Design Museum, are populated with odd artifacts spanning from the 17th century to the present day. Notable highlights include the hula chair, the Segway, the Apple Newton and frozen beef lasagna created by Colgate. Now embarking on its first-ever world tour, the Museum of Failure will bring an exceptionally educational and insightful experience to Los Angeles through Feb. 4 at $11 for admission.
Museum of Illusions 
After debuting this past summer in Vienna, Austria, the Museum of Illusions celebrated its Los Angeles grand opening on New Year’s Day at its new location on Hollywood Boulevard. The museum contains over 20 immersive optical illusions designed to visually deceive visitors and make them second guess their perceptions of reality. Highlights from the museum’s other locations include the Ames Room, reminiscent of the illusory hallway scene from the classic film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and the Vortex Tunnel, a motion illusion room that places visitors on a bridge within a spinning cylinder. Photography is not only allowed, but also encouraged — the museum is intended to provide patrons with a variety of vivid and unusual photo-ops amid the most imaginative settings. Tickets are available at a discounted rate of $15 until Jan. 9 and will be sold for the regular price of $25 after that.

Prior to the 75th Golden Globes on Sunday, the awards show was already making headlines and sparking controversy and speculation. Many wondered whether actors and actresses  would address #MeToo, a national movement aimed at exposing fostering dialogue about sexual misconduct, misogyny and a number of other societal issues. The evening ultimately witnessed celebrities balancing social activism with celebration of each other’s work.
The night began with the red carpet, which saw celebrities using their platforms to raise awareness about sexual harassment and gender inequality by wearing black and discussing #MeToo when interviewed by reporters. 
By wearing black, actors aimed to stand in solidarity with victims of sexual misconduct. Beyond standing in solidarity, a number of celebrities in attendance, including actresses Eva Longoria and Reese Witherspoon, led the charge to combat systemic sexism in Hollywood and across all industries by launching Time’s Up, a legal defense fund to help low-income women seeking justice for sexual harassment and assault in the workplace.  Other actresses like Michelle Williams and Emma Watson invited activists as their guests on the red carpet to further raise awareness about those who are fighting for equality. 
Late night comedian and Golden Globes host Seth Meyers promised to address the issue of systemic sexual harassment prior to the awards show, while also celebrating achievements in Hollywood throughout the past year. Meyers’ ability to frame politics into intelligent and insightful jokes energized the night. “Good evening, women and remaining gentlemen,” Meyers said in his opening monologue. “It’s 2018. Marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally isn’t.”
As the night progressed, the ceremony saw crucial victories for diversity and social progress. Actor Sterling K. Brown made history by becoming the first black actor to win the award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama for his work in This is Us. Aziz Ansari also became the first Asian male actor to win the Golden Globe for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy for his performance in the Netflix series Master of None. Elisabeth Moss took home the award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series-Drama for her performance in The Handmaid’s Tale, a Hulu original series about a dystopian society with legal restrictions on women’s rights.
Other surprising wins included James Franco as Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical category, beating Daniel Kaluuya, whose performance in the horror-comedy Get Out was one of the most talked about of the year. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, a controversial movie due to its critical portrayal of law enforcement, took home the coveted award for Best Picture – Drama. Despite high expectations for Steven Spielberg’s The Post, the film flopped at the Golden Globes, drawing comments about the irony of a Press Association ignoring a film about the press in a climate that has presented new challenges to the journalism profession. 
Some snubs of the night included Jordan Peele’s Get Out, which offered widely discussed commentary about modern race relations, and James Ivory‘s stunning adaption of Call Me by Your Name in the category for Best Screenplay – Motion Picture. Additionally, although Lady Bird brought home the award for Best Picture – Comedy or Musical, many expected director Greta Gerwig to be nominated for Best Director for her debut film.  
Nonetheless, the evening saw plenty of widely predicted outcomes, too. Nicole Kidman won the award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for Television for her work in “Big Little Lies,” while her co-star, Alexander Skarsgård, won the award Best Performance by an Actor in the same category. Another predictable winner of the evening was Pixar’s Coco, which won the award for Best Animated Feature, but a shadow loomed over the film’s victory due to the multiple sexual assault allegations against Pixar co-founder John Lasseter.
The highlight of the evening was a surprisingly emotional speech given by Oprah Winfrey, who became the first black woman to receive the Cecil B. de Mille award. Winfrey dedicated her speech to discussing the oppression and historic accomplishments of black women, thanking the press and giving a nod to the #MeToo movement.
The 75th Golden Globes was an evening of historic firsts for diversity and women in the industry. Throughout the night, actresses used their platforms as presenters to continue shining light on women’s issues in Hollywood and advocating for change. Notable absences of the night included the outspoken actress and activist Rose McGowan, who expressed her disdain for the Golden Globes all-black fashion statement and what she called the “Hollywood fakery” of the night. Asia Argento, who was featured heavily in the New Yorker story that exposed years of sxual misconduct allegations against Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein, wasn’t invited to the show and neither was Rosanna Arquette, another prominent Weinstein accuser.
But notably, while the entire awards show focused on the theme of female empowerment, no women were nominated for Best Director, a hypocrisy actress Natalie Portman did not shy away from calling out. “Here are the all-male nominees,” she said as she presented the category. Actress Barbra Streisand also joked about her status as the only woman to win the award of Best Director at the Golden Globes back in 1984, nearly 30 years ago.

USC had played it perfectly. With the game tied in the waning seconds, the Trojans had forced a Stanford miss. And their leader, senior guard Jordan McLaughlin, had dribbled the length of the court, put a stop-and-start move on Stanford’s Kezie Okpala and made a difficult off-balanced layup while falling to the ground with 1.7 seconds remaining.
Barring a prayer on the other end, the game would be over, USC would have won its third straight conference game and taken another step toward rebuilding its season after a mediocre start.
But, there was still time for Stanford to throw up a Hail Mary. Freshman guard Daejon Davis took one dribble and tossed up a shot from beyond center court. It had good arc, good trajectory. The horn sounded. The red lights on the backboard flashed. And the ball — it dropped through.
A split second, and then bedlam.
Stanford’s players piled on top of Davis in celebration. The packed student section at Maples Pavilion erupted. On the other side, junior forward Chimezie Metu just stood at halfcourt, his hands on his head, incredulous. McLaughlin, who had taken a tumble after making the layup, walked gingerly toward his bench before sitting on the court in disbelief, staring up at the jumbotron.
“I was just hoping he didn’t get it off in time,” McLaughlin said.
The replay, though, was clear: Davis’ shot was good. The final — Stanford 77, USC 76. And like that, USC had gone from jubilation to heartbreak, from big road conference win to another crushing defeat for a team needing to stockpile victories to save its NCAA Tournament hopes.
“I’ve never lost like that before,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “Give Stanford credit. They made the last play of the game. We made one with 1.7 left, they made one with no time left. It was just an unbelievable shot.”

However, there were chances for USC to put the game away on Sunday. The Trojans took a 47-36 lead into halftime, but they let the Cardinal back into the game. After Metu’s jumper put USC ahead 68-53 midway through the second half, the Trojans’ offense disappeared. They managed just two field goals in the next nine minutes, while the Cardinal went on a 21-4 run to take the lead.
“We were up [15]. We should’ve kept going,” McLaughlin said. “They went on a run and we couldn’t stop the run for a few minutes. We just got to execute and get that lead up higher.”
But in a game of back-and-forth spurts by both sides, the Trojans couldn’t stop the Cardinal’s final run. They could not contain Stanford’s Reid Travis, a 6-foot-8, 245-pound forward who poured in a game-high 29 points and shot 11 free throws, out-muscling USC’s big men.
“We need to do a better job guarding the low post,” Enfield said.

Ultimately, USC failed to close out a game that it had in its grasps. The Trojans had it set up nicely after falling behind early, 7-0. They quickly flipped a switch, forcing turnovers and making 3-pointers to take control of the game. McLaughlin’s streaking layup to beat the first half buzzer and extend the lead to double digits punctuated 20 minutes of USC playing to its strengths. None of that translated to the critical parts of the second half.
“We were playing very well,” Enfield said. “We had a couple crucial turnovers. We missed some really easy shots. It seemed like they made every shot for about a 4-5 minute stretch to really cut the lead down.”
The Trojans wound up with 10 turnovers, most of them coming in the second half after recording just two in the first half. They had strong scoring distribution — Metu leading the way with 20 points, McLaughlin adding 16. Sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic had 17 points and seven rebounds, flashing energy and hustle. Junior forward Bennie Boatwright scored 13 points.
None of it mattered, though, in the end. In all the years that Enfield has played and coached basketball, he said he’s never lost like this. For McLaughlin, it was a loss that ranks among the toughest in his career.
“We were in [the locker room] saying that really didn’t just happen,” McLaughlin said. “I just keep replaying it. It’s crazy. Tough way to lose.”
