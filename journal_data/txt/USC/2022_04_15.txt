Led by Ephar Anwar, students rallied Wednesday evening to chants of “USC break the silence,” “USC, hold China accountable” and “Free the Uyghurs,’ demanding the University recognize the Uyghur genocide in Chinese occupied East Turkistan. The protest started in front of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, making its way through Trousdale Parkway and to the USC Village before entering campus again through McClintock Avenue and making its way back to RTCC.
“USC speaks up about almost every human right issue, but they never speak about the Uyghurs,” Anwar, a senior majoring in international relations, global business, said. “USC, stand for Uyghurs.” 
Anwar serves as president of the Muslim Student Union, and said that more than 93 of her relatives have gone missing since China occupied East Turkistan and started operating detention camps for Uyghur people. Millions of Uyghurs have been detained and subjected to inhumane conditions, such as forced sterilizations, sexual assault, indoctrination and slave labor.
The University has not made any statements denouncing the genocide. While the USC US-China Institute informed the community about US-China relations and policy, they have not given much coverage to the Uyghur genocide, Anwar said.
“[Uyghur students] do not feel like USC cares about the genocide. We always say the notion ‘never again;’ however, we are letting it happen in our own eyes,” Anwar said. “Right now, it seems like USC is walking over the genocide, maybe because of economic ties, but we don’t know.”
Lula Haji, a sophomore majoring in political science and law, history, and culture who attended the protest, compared the lack of University response to the Uyghur crisis to the statement USC released earlier this semester in support of Ukrainian students.
“Evidently, the University has stances on these issues, and it’s about which issues USC chooses to prioritize,” Haji said. “It doesn’t seem like they’re prioritizing a clear human rights issue and a genocide that’s happening right now.” 
Apart from issuing a statement in support of Uyghur students, the University could also offer trauma-specific mental health resources for students who are affected by the genocide, reconsider possible economic ties with Chinese corporations and create programs for East Turkistan and Uyghur studies, Anwar said.
Students can support their Uyghur peers by taking time to learn about the issue, attending protests that raise awareness, pressuring the University to divest from Chinese government funded institutes and boycot companies that use Uyghur forced labor, such as Nike, Zara and Gap.
Aimen Ahmed, a sophomore majoring in international relations and the global economy and geodesign, attended the protest because it is important for her to help bring awareness to the issue. She said it is easy for Americans to forget about human rights violations happening around the world, but actively attending demonstrations and protests helps to keep issues relevant and encourage people learning about the subject. 
“People should do research and get to know more about what’s going on,” Ahmed said. “In America, we stress this individualism, but we as humans should care about what happens to other people, and we should be more selfless and try to learn more about what’s going on in the world.”
Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan, a freshman majoring in international relations, said he joined the protest because of the the various human rights violations that do not receive enough attention. He said students should use their freedom of speech to read about the genocide and speak up against it.
“If we don’t speak up, there’s no one to speak up for [detained Uyghurs] because they can’t speak up for themselves,” Khan said.
MSU held the Uyghur solidarity protest in collaboration with Delta Phi Epsilon, USC’s foreign service society. During their 2020 action week, DPE held a similar demonstration in support of Uyghurs, so MSU invited them to join today’s protest.
“I’m really grateful that MSU reached out to us, and we got to work with them on this because I think it’s definitely something that I’ve learned a lot from preparing for [the protest],” said Sydnee Yu, DPE’s humanitarian service coordinator.

President Carol Folt spoke on USC’s social justice triumphs — including her response to historical criticism of the University — and the financial progress made in the past year at her third annual State of the University Thursday. Held virtually for the last two years, the hybrid address had more than 50 students, staff and faculty in attendance at Bovard Auditorium, with even more watching online.
Folt began her speech by recounting her visit to the recently opened Nisei Rock Garden, which the University dedicated to the roughly 250 Nisei students who were forced to leave school and imprisoned in American internment camps during World War II. Following the war, former USC President Rufus von Kleinsmid barred the Nisei students from returning to their studies and denied them access to their transcripts.
“These injustices were antithetical to our current dreams, but they were also at complete odds with USC’s founding mission,” Folt said during the address. “Two weeks ago, after 80 years, we acknowledged this injustice by creating this beautiful garden and by awarding posthumous degrees to all the remaining Nisei Trojans who we could locate.”
Folt continued her focus on social justice as she recounted the dedication ceremony for the newly named Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International and Public Affairs. The building— previously named the Von KleinSmid Center after former University president and known eugenicist von KleinSmid — will now celebrate “Trojan leader” and Native American historian, humanist, musician and educator Medicine Crow.
“[The ceremony] taught me that a powerful way to avoid repeating injustice is by admitting it, remembering it and correcting it,” Folt said. “I want to express my incredible gratitude to legions and decades of students, faculty, staff, alumni in our own Indigenous community, who have been advocating for decades that we uncover both of these truths and make amends.”
Folt also touched on the University’s expanding environmental initiatives, spearheaded by the President’s Working Group on sustainability in research, education and operations, which she launched in 2019. The group’s goals include achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 and a waste-free campus by 2028. As an environmental scientist, Folt said she understands the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach to addressing the climate crisis.
“We’re turning our concern into action, starting right here at home,” Folt said. “For this reason, we truly need to embed a sustainability mindset into everything that we do at USC. No effort is too ambitious or too small.”
Folt then discussed USC achievements made in the past year, starting with the University’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, such as more than 1 million tests administered and over 250 studies on the impact of the virus. 
“Our return to in-person activities is nearly complete,” Folt said. “We successfully ensured the health and safety of the USC community and millions of our fellow Angelenos … USC has been, and continues to be, among the leaders in higher education in terms of our COVID-19 response.”
The University became a member of the “billion-dollar club” for external research funding, Folt said, including a nearly $50 million grant addressing health needs in diverse communities.
“In all of these endeavors, it is really impressive to see how strongly everyone kept pushing their scholarship, their research, their creative work, even under the most trying conditions of the pandemic,” Folt said.
Folt transitioned into her “moonshot goals” for the future of USC. Her first goal, USC Competes, aims to make USC a national leader in accessibility, affordability and belonging by increasing financial aid and investing in the local community. Her second goal, to transform USC’s health sciences, will look to grow investments in medical training and practice.
Another moonshot initiative emphasizes the financial success of the athletics department and its impact on USC students and the Los Angeles community. The final moonshot goal, called the Frontiers of Computing, is a 10-year initiative to accelerate advanced computing research and training in the USC community.
“Sixty-seven percent of today’s workers, it’s calculated, lack the digital skills for their job,” Folt said. “USC certainly can help fill that gap by innovating our academic programs, becoming the largest source of diverse tech talent on the west coast with trust and ethics as a core part of the curriculum that we produce.”
Folt ended her address with a Q&A session, where an attendee asked for Folt to expand on the importance of the recent social initiatives on campus, specifically the renaming of the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow building.
“Often, these things take years before you realize how it affected you,” said Folt. “But later when you think about points of pride in your University, it’s awfully nice to be excited that we’re one of the first places in America to have a Native American name on a building that is central to our campus.”
When asked to describe the current generation of students on campus in one word, Folt responded with “impatient.”
“If you don’t have impatience, you’re not going to make any change,” she said. “They want to give back. They want to know why and they want to be a part of it … You walk around USC and every student you meet has a very big dream. They truly imagine that they are going to do some really awesome stuff. And that’s a huge positive energy for the community.”

Here’s my problem: As we get closer to the end of the semester, I am reminded of all of the things I want to write about. I want to write about language and the way that some books can be so lyrical. I want to write about how criminally underrated five television shows are. I want to yell about why you should not feel ashamed to DNF a book. To be honest with you, I can’t write all that in this column. Do you know what that means? I need to turn to a recent Daily Trojan newsroom conversation that I had.
You shouldn’t be surprised that it’s about Taylor Swift. I’m not a Swiftie, but by complete accident, I pretty much only hang out with them. Swift isn’t really in the news lately, but because she clearly has so much love for the Class of 2022 (She’ll soon have an honorary degree from NYU) and because the newsroom has so many Swifties, we were talking about which USC schools match her albums: Is Dornsife “folklore,” “Fearless” or “Red?” My mind immediately asked, “How can I make this about books?”
It’s actually easy. I don’t know if you’re as knee-deep in literary news as I am, but Swift has recently made headlines in the book community. You see, every book club’s favorite novel, “Where the Crawdads Sing,’’ is being adapted to film by fellow book nerd Reese Witherspoon. To add more book connections, “Normal People’s” Daisy Edgar Jones will play the lead character, Kya. 
Like any good filmmaker would, the team chose Taylor Swift to create a feature song, “Carolina,” for the film. 
Even beyond that, it’s easy to make connections between Taylor Swift and books beyond the fact that “Romeo and Juliet” is mentioned in everyone’s favorite “Love Story.” She writes songs as if she leads a second life as a poet and novelist — and I can totally see her in an all-black outfit with a beret doing slam poetry in some Manhattan hole-in-the-wall.  
As I was telling my fellow DT writers, “folklore” screams July 2020. I remember listening to it for the first time and texting my group chat with friends all my thoughts, frequently in all-caps. My two favorite songs are “the last great american dynasty” (because history) and “august” (tragic love story) because you can basically hear the story unfold, and it’s like getting lost in the best of books.
Speaking of a tragic love story, I think I need to turn to the first installment in “The Raven Cycle” series, “The Raven Boys” by Maggie Steifvater. This was also The Moment. “The Raven Boys” takes place in the fictional town of Henrietta, Va., where the sun is hot and the local all-boys private school is just as stifling. Our main character, Blue Sargent, has been told that if she kisses her true love, he will die. So, she mostly just keeps to herself in her home full of clairvoyants where her mom also works as a psychic. When she sees a spirit on St. Mark’s eve, she is told that “There are only two reasons a non-seer would see a spirit on St. Mark’s eve… Either you’re his true love… or you killed him.” 
One can imagine where the story goes from there, as the reader tries to figure out if it is a tragedy or a love story. I adore “The Raven Boys” because the characters are three-dimensional and you can see how Steifvater inputted her own interests in the story. It’s full of old cars, Welsh mythology and the Appalachian landscape. All-in-all, it’s very Swift. 
Let’s talk “Speak Now.” Have you heard that Taylor Swift was “wonderstruck, blushing all the way home?” As I was writing this column, I texted a friend about a book that reminds her of Taylor Swift, and she told me that “Enchanted” reminds her of “The Selection” series by Kiera Cass. As you might imagine, it was astonishing to realize that I have not yet written about this series. Basically, it is “The Bachelor” meets a pastel dystopia. If you haven’t heard of it, please don’t be embarrassed — it came out at the height of “The Hunger Games” and “Divergent” craze.
In the first book, 35 girls compete for the chance to be “Selected” to win the heart of Prince Maxon. However, our heroine does not want to be princess; Instead, she wants to live out her days with the secret love of her life from a caste below her (As with most dystopias, the caste really matters). But when she is Selected, what happens? This book deserved more love back in the day and if you love “Speak Now,” you will love this book. Between the big curls, purple dress and the fairy tale analogies and references? It’s all perfect.
Of course, I can’t sign off on this column without talking about “Fearless,” which deserves a romance book of its own — nothing less than “I Believe in A Thing Called Love” by Maurene Goo.
I love this book for a number of reasons. It is so very SoCal and has the most clever chapter titles. Our heroine, Desi, has a bad track record with love and decides to craft a foolproof plan based on her favorite Korean dramas. Of course, this leads to aforementioned creative titles, such as “Life Threatening Event Makes Him/ You Realize How Real Your Love Is.” This book is like “Forever & Always,” “Hey Stephen” and “Fearless” (my personal favorites) all wrapped into one. I would recommend them any day. 
So, perhaps I am a bit of a Swiftie by osmosis, but I think that Taylor Swift is an all-season singer and a novelist that just has yet to write the story into a paperback. Someone just needs to write a fiction story based on “All Too Well,” and I’m sure that one day, I’ll be emotionally ready to read it. You know, as she says: “I’m in my feelings more than Drake, so yeah.”

Even though it feels like we are just finally starting to adjust to a new in-person (and even maskless) workflow, the end of the term is only a few weeks away. Fortunately, we can soothe ourselves of this bittersweet feeling by looking up at sunnier skies and ever-growing cherry blossom trees — and by listening to one song every day that, in times of stress, can help ease us back into the present moment: the final stretch of April 2022.
April 15 – “Kiss Me” by Sixpence None the Richer 
On this third Friday of April, dust off this past week and get dressed and ready to go to a social event — or not — with this quintessential ‘90s rom com song. Whether you spend the night at a party or inside your apartment, by the end of tonight’s “milky twilight,” you still have the whole weekend ahead of you!
April 16 – “Amoeba” by Clairo 
Maybe the social event you went to yesterday or the one you’re going to tonight isn’t a smashing success. Clairo understands the tension between the fear of missing out and the fear of making a fool out of yourself. But hey, who said social unease can’t be a little groovy? 
April 17 – “GOLDWING” by Billie Eilish 
Take a moment to appreciate the arrival of a warmer season with this young artist’s angelic voice. Then, get into some head bobbing when the harmonic tone of the first minute transitions into an electronic beat-driven reminder to stay grounded. 
April 18 – “Soda” by Nothing But Thieves 
Embrace the Monday blues with a fresh can of soda and a song that goes by the same name. You may be happy to find that this tune, sung gorgeously by frontman Conor Mason, is just one of many brilliant, dynamic tracks in the British band’s discography.
April 19 – “Skate” by Silk Sonic 
Glide out of the energetic Aries season with Anderson .Paak’s sultry voice and Bruno Mars’ impassioned higher register. For fans of new releases, this tune may have already got its fair share of plays, but there’s no way anyone can get tired of such a classic sound. 
April 20 – “Fancy” by Lennon Stella 
Indulge in the finer things this Taurus season with one of Canada’s newest and most alluring singer-songwriters. Maybe start making dinner plans for this weekend while you’re at it. 
April 21 – “Stoned at the Nail Salon” by Lorde 
You’re starting to plan out the logistics of your finals week, but that can be stressful. If you have a moment, treat yourself to a manicure while this song plays in your earbuds. Feel free to close your eyes and envision a land that is not so far away: summer vacation. 
April 22 – “I Feel the Earth Move” by Carole King
It’s Earth Day! Can you feel it? Boogie to this song while picking up trash on the beach or taking a sip out of your reusable water bottle. 
April 23 – “Lady Macbeth in Chains” by Sufjan Stevens and Angelo De Augustine
On the 406th anniversary of the beloved playwright William Shakespeare’s passing, help preserve his legacy by listening to this duo’s tranquil tribute to his play.
April 24 – “Stronger (What Doesn’t Kill Me)” by Kelly Clarkson 
If it’s your birthday today, you might be glad to know that you share it with the powerful vocalist behind this empowering song. Belt alongside the first “American Idol” winner as you make that final push to the end of the week. 
April 25 – “Will We Talk” by Sam Fender
Get to know this birthday boy from North Shields with a hit from his 2019 debut album “Hypersonic Missiles.” He might be an ocean away but he’s no stranger to the relatable difficulty of forming romantic relationships in your young adulthood. 
April 26 – “Cherry Flavoured” by The Neighborhood 
Hooray! Cherries are in season! Remember to cue this atmospheric bop when you get a little sugar high off a fresh new batch of these delicious little fruits. 
April 27 – “Good as Hell” by Lizzo 
This GRAMMY award-winning singer wouldn’t want you to feel down about yourself on her birthday. So why not tap into this hit’s quintessentially pre-pandemic energy?
April 28 – “Sunflower, Vol. 6” by Harry Styles 
Even as school work intensifies, appreciate Southern California’s surroundings by taking three minutes and 41 seconds to hum along to this track, sung by a former One Direction member. 
April 29 – “Working Man” by Otis Rush 
As you study for finals or write your last papers, celebrate this late blues guitarists’ birthday with one of his biggest hits. Maybe get up and dance a bit if you notice you’re getting a bit tense. 
April 30 – “AM I DREAMING” by Lil Nas X feat. Miley Cyrus 
Did this past month just happen? I think so, but can we ever be certain? Are we all just part of a simulation? Perhaps this is all a bit more existential than April baby Lil Nas X intended with this track, but I think we can all relate to that — reality, dream or simulation, we want what we did this month to count. We want to be remembered for our efforts — especially by that one particularly harsh professor you have.

As of this Wednesday on Hulu, the Kardashians are back. And, spoiler alert — they have a new font. That’s really the only major change, but definitely a big one (at least enough to warrant an entirely new, multimillion-dollar show). 
After less than a year-long break, America’s most famous family returns to the screen in their new Hulu show “The Kardashians.” The pilot, which premiered Wednesday proves that fans of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” have nothing to fear. As the family frets over who got invited to a random, mid-week barbeque, talks at length about all their work (and how lazy the rest of the world is) without ever being seen doing said work and as Kim faces backlash for hosting an upcoming “Saturday Night Live” episode, audiences can find comfort in just how little the Kardashians have changed. 
That being said, there are a couple noticeable shifts in the newer, sleeker streaming version of the show. First and foremost, “The Kardashians” finally recognizes what viewers really want — house content. A long, tracking opening shot takes the audience through an extensive (albeit speed ramped) tour of the major sets of this show, offering a sequel to the already considerable coverage (thanks Architectural Digest) of the Kardashians’ luxury homes. Furthermore, the new, aforementioned serif (!) font and spunky, freeze-framed titles give the classic split-screen transitions of KUWTK a new HGTV feel.
“The Kardashians” also shows how a break was the last thing this family needed. Not only has the (brief) absence given viewers time to get over their long-term fascination with the Kardashians, thus making the audience harder to impress, but it has also given time for the Kardashians to learn from their mistakes in KUWTK and sharpen their skills.
Now, the family is too good at being famous. They’ve returned to television with a level of refinement and artificiality that exponentially exceeds their previous show. “The Kardashians” does not star a messy, dramatic influencer family backstabbing each other and dropping what becomes months-old gossip in interview inserts. Instead, it is a show about an unimaginably powerful family reckoning with remarriage, dominance in late stage capitalism and whether or not they’re funny. 
This new cultural context is fully put on display in the pilot as Kim battles the resurgence of possibly another sex tape (yes, it is an uncannily well-timed callback to the first season of KUWTK). As Kim and her family compare this experience to the one years ago, Kim asserts that she now knows what to do, and has the means to do it. In a call to Kanye about the situation, he tells Kim (according to her) “You have the power. Nothing will cancel you.” Later, Kim ends the episode with a declaration to her lawyer that “I have all the time, all the money, and all of the resources to burn them all to the fucking ground.” This level of invincibility does accurately represent the Kardashians’ place in society — they truly are uncancelable (as the reboot of this classically unpopular show proves). However, it also makes the drama, reality TV nature of this show less entertaining for the average viewer when they know the stars cannot lose. 
“Keeping Up With the Kardashians” originally covered a moderately famous family navigating the drama and excitement of the entertainment industry in the 2000s. Now, “The Kardashians” is a show about one of the most powerful families in the country being just that. At least in the pilot, there is none of that simple, trashy drama or ridiculous one-liners that cemented KUWTK as a decently popular, cult series. Now, there are only extremely long scenes about Scott Disick feeling left out (like, extremely long. There was a full five minute conversation about this and it wasn’t even the only one) and how Kim is stressed about SNL (again, multiple 3-5 minute scenes). Ultimately, it is now only the banal drama that they can’t solve with a quick phone call or a couple million dollars. 
The freedom of streaming definitely promised potential for a Kardashian show that kept the drama and humor while also covering the heavier topics of the Kardashians’ role in society, or at least fit some kind of economic critique into their constant complaints of how no one in the world understands hard work like they do. Instead, it has floundered in trying to dramatize a family who has become too successful at being dramatized. But perhaps it was just a slow start to the season — we all know what happens when Kim finally does go on SNL. 
However, no matter your opinions on the Kardashians, their cultural role, what they’re doing to the youth of America and whatnot, the new show does do well in reminding viewers of one, timeless truth — no matter the time, place or network, no one is as obsessed with the Kardashians as Scott Disick. There has to be some kind of social commentary in that.

When I ask people if they are  feminists, I am baffled by the number of people who say no. This isn’t just something I’ve noticed in college, but rather an issue that entered my peripherals as early as high school. 
As a cisgender woman, I am an advocate for women’s rights and gender equality, and I have identified as a feminist for as long as I can remember. It is no secret that women are often paid less, occupy fewer positions of leadership and are taken advantage of by those in positions of power. Women should have equal opportunities and pay in the workplace and be able to express their opinions as men do, this shouldn’t be controversial.  
So when I hear women tell me they don’t believe in feminism, it takes me a moment to understand what they could possibly mean. Do they truly believe they deserve less opportunity and respect than their male counterparts? It makes me question if they don’t believe that their mothers, sisters, friends or even partners who also identify as women deserve opportunities, respect and equality. What could be so controversial about women’s rights? 
According to a 2020 study by the Pew Research Center, about six in 10 women in the U.S. today say “feminist” describes them very (19%) or somewhat (42%) well. However, those who consider themselves to be men or part of the Republican Party are far less likely to describe themselves as feminists. About 64% of Americans say feminism is empowering and 42% see it as inclusive. At the same time, 45% say it is polarizing and 30% say it’s outdated.
After conversations with others who think this way, I have learned that it is less about controversy; rather, it is an issue of perpetuated stereotypes and misconceptions. Women’s rights aren’t outdated, and they don’t need to be political.
Feminism may mean a lot of things to different people, and the way in which it may look in one person’s life may be completely different from another’s. However, at its core, it is a belief that should be far less controversial than it is. To directly quote Oxford Languages, feminism is “the advocacy of women’s rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.”
I’ve heard on several occasions that one believes in equal rights for feminism but not the “extreme” views of feminism. The media has so often portrayed feminism to look one way: angry. It is the idea that feminists are angry women, often stereotyped to not believe in wearing makeup, shaving, liking men or other cliches that oppose typical cliches of femininity. None of these qualities are bad, but they are by no means representative of feminism as a whole. 
You do not have to be angry and forceful. You can be shy, quiet, girly, masculine or gender-fluid and still believe in a world where rights are accessible to all people. Feminism isn’t a set of mannerisms, political beliefs or one type of person. A feminist is someone who believes in equity for all people, regardless of how they may identify. You can be of any gender identity, sexual orienatation or political affiliation and believe that the women in your life deserve access to equality and equal rights.
The close association of feminism in the media with angry, strong, forceful women hoping to put men down is detrimental. While many feminists are strong and forceful, it is out of a hope to see a world where women have equal access to human rights, not out of being “anti-man.” 
As written in “The Combahee River Collective”, created by a collective of Black feminists, feminist politics are “committed to struggling against racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class oppression” while understanding that “major systems of oppression are interlocking.”
Feminism, at its core, is about equality. It isn’t about “sameness,” as many who do not believe in feminism offer up an argument based on body composition and the idea that men and women are not built the same, but the concept of “equal” when referencing rights and opportunities. 
Beyond the lack of support feminism faces, it must be understood in a light of inclusivity. Recently, Legacy Russell, a leading author and writer, addressed issues facing modern day feminism. 
“To invest in the future of feminism is to shape a different type of feedback loop, one that does experimental work, innovating through and beyond established canons,” Russell said. “Female identified people, working class people, disabled people, people of color, femme people have always been a part of art history and we didn’t just get here. We’ve been here all along.”
The misconceptions of feminism drive many away from supporting a movement that represents fundamental human rights. A deeper understanding of feminism and its true meaning is necessary in a world where equality is at the forefront of social movements and can be advocated by anyone, regardless of their gender identity.

It’s that weird, sentimental time where, instead of finishing projects or studying for upcoming finals, I spend hours on end reminiscing about my life. When I’m not doing just that in the Daily Trojan newsroom as I stare blankly at the Downtown skyline or an InDesign page, I’m pondering the what-ifs and should’ve-saids in the comfort of my car. Bess, the Volkswagen Passat whose name was short for “Bessie the Banshee” — an homage to the screeching sound of her brakes when my family first got her — drives, quite literally, this column. 
So, as with all of my columns at this point, allow me to babble on about my fascination with my car, my relationship woes and a handful of puns that commuters might know. With Bess recently topping the 60,000 mile mark, here’s a letter to my Banshee that speeds down the 10 freeway:
Dear Bess,
Congratulations for burning rubber over a distance of 60,000 miles — you bring a great deal of pride to the “VW” engraved on your front bumper. You’ve survived the life-draining forces of Los Angeles traffic, the hellish dust storms en route to the California-Nevada border and dents and scratches from people who literally do not know how to park in the Downey Parking Structure. 
Like many cars, your engine hums at the crack of dawn and delivers me home safely as the moon glimmers in the night sky. However, you are more than just another hunk of metal — you are my therapist, teacher, wingwoman, guardian and best friend. 
I may not have been the best of owners — no excuses can be given on that. I’ve unnecessarily pushed you to your limits, consumed by the hubris of a childish driver who believes they can outpace every car on the road, one with regard only for the time rather than the travelers. For a columnist who brings you up in almost every rendition of this column, I should be better. I can promise to be better too, but then again, promises really can feel like empty words exchanged to appease some internal guilt. 
Time and time again, you’ve seen me fall in love, fall out of it, then subsequently back into it. You’re probably tired of that, I’d imagine. You’ve heard me yell, cry and scream — not only at the reckless cars that endanger our shared livelihoods, but at myself — at the times I could have been better, more compassionate.
But I know that, regardless, you’re always looking out for me, still blinking when I need to change lanes and kicking cold air in my face when I’m drowsy at the wheel.
You may not be able to directly answer my questions: The “What did I do wrong?” “Where could I have been better?” “Who taught you how to drive?” and the deadly “What if…?” among them. However, we can spend days, months or years running around searching for answers to questions that we will never solve, circling a roundabout with constantly changing exits but never finding the one we’re looking for. 
You taught me that reality can be like an endless road: I don’t know where the road will end up (more importantly, I don’t need to know), sure, but I get to enjoy the asphalt within eyesight, the scenery to my sides and the cars that share the road.
At the end of the day, you gave me the opportunity to accomplish what I could have never dreamed of going into my first year as a driving commuter. 
You helped ease my fears: the ones that told me I could never spend time with close friends who lived near campus or work jobs that were never close to home. You let me pursue hobbies, go on joyrides, divulge in a variety of music genres and made my time at USC more than worthwhile. While I may not have always jumped at that chance, you gave me a chance to be happy. 
So, to what some consider the conglomerate of metal, wires, glass, rubber and plastic that keeps my world spinning, a thank you should be in order. But to my best friend — the one with four wheels, screeching brakes and a less than perfect audio system — I can’t thank you enough. 
Happy trails,
Lois — the guy who needs to bring you in for an oil change.

After the Lakers were defeated in their season opener against the Golden State Warriors in late October, I wrote in my first column of the season, “At the end of the day, the Lakeshow still houses two basketball unicorns — I think they’ll be just fine.”
The Lakers were far from “just fine.” I was wrong, just like LeBron James, the Lakers front office and former Head Coach Frank Vogel. However, it didn’t cost me my job like it did for Vogel. 
The ominous signs of a failed experiment were present from Game 1. Coming into this season, the Lakers had won 74% of the games James and Anthony Davis played together — only an enigma in the form of a 6-foot-3 point guard could derail this type of dominance. In the 2021-22 season, the Lakers had a .500 record in the 22 games the two unicorns shared the court, a staggering drop off that brought to light a multitude of issues etched into the Lakers core. 
There is no reason the Lakers shouldn’t be a lock for the playoffs next year with James and Davis. Here’s how the Lakers can recoup and progress on their road to revival, step-by-step.
Step 1: The right man at the helm
It may seem crazy to fire a coach that raised another banner in crypto.com Arena just two seasons ago, but that 2020 championship winning squad was the perfect fit for Vogel’s system. The roster, ripe with “3-and-D” players who knew their role next to two superstars, enabled Vogel to run circles around other coaches in the Orlando bubble. His picture-perfect schemes aided the Lakers in having the third best defensive rating in the league that season. 
But Vogel is a system coach, unable to adapt without the right pieces at his disposal. When he couldn’t salvage his trainwreck of a team composed of NBA veterans with miles on their bodies, his players stopped giving maximum effort night-in and night-out. It was a recipe for disaster. 
The next Lakers head coach needs to have the team’s trust and faith. The Lakers gave up on Vogel early in the season because they didn’t believe in him, so there was no one to light a fire under them when must-win games rolled around. LeBron will never take a step back in being involved in the way his team operates, but this next coach has to be one that he respects, trusts and will demand of him a consistent effort on the defensive end. 
A few names have been thrown out into the mix: Utah’s Quin Snyder, Philadelphia’s Doc Rivers, even Michigan’s Juwan Howard or a potential long shot with Toronto’s Nick Nurse. Whoever comes out on top has their work cut out for them. Resurrecting this broken Lakers team will be no easy feat.
Step 2: Trading the enigma 
Anyone who has watched even the Lakers all season could tell you that Russell Westbrook needs to be traded. But, let’s be fair to Westbrook first — he was set up to fail. This team was built to none of his strengths, and he lost a lob threat and pick-and-roll partner when Davis got hurt. 
But the fit with LeBron was clunky and awkward, neither wanting to play off-ball. Westbrook’s insistence on playing his own brand of basketball and shutting out Vogel pointed to an imperative breakup.
Westbrook will likely opt into his $47 million player option in the offseason. I mean, who wouldn’t? 
The expiring nature of his contract could be appealing to a rebuilding team like the Indiana Pacers, who could offload Malcolm Brogdon and Buddy Hield’s contracts to the Lakers to clear up cap space for future seasons. The Charlotte Hornets could be in the mix as well — a trade likely centered around Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier. 
The Lakers’ hands are tied, with roster flexibility on the horizon only if they attach their future 2027 or 2029 first-round pick to Westbrook. Who knows what the team will look like so far down the road? But when you have a player of LeBron James’ caliber, you must move all your chips onto the table. 
Step 3: Youth, energy and defense
Malik Monk, Austin Reaves and Stanley Johnson were bright spots during a dark Lakers season, all warranting contracts for next season. Even Talen Horton-Tucker, who drastically underachieved this season, should be given another chance in more spaced out lineups. 
The Lakers tried to run veteran-heavy lineups through the season, which heavily backfired into a 33-49 record. Avery Bradley, Carmelo Anthony, Wayne Ellington and Kent Bazemore all need to be shown the door. The front office must infuse this team with a balance of young guns and veterans that can still compete at an NBA level, using the 2020 championship squad as a blueprint. 
The Lakers finished the season with 41 starting lineups and 33 wins. Add continuity and chemistry onto the long-winded list of things that the Lakers need.
Top to bottom, the Lakers should look a whole lot different next season, or they could be staring down a dark road for years to come, reminiscent of the post-Kobe Bryant era.

No. 19 women’s tennis are slated to play No. 15 UCLA in a key rivalry matchup Friday, marking the teams’ second matchup of the season. In their previous match, the Bruins defeated the Trojans 4-1. 
USC currently has a record of 16-10 overall and 6-3 in Pac-12 play, placing them fourth in Pac-12 standings. UCLA sits at 11-4 overall and 7-0 in conference play, holding first place. 
On the singles court, USC has No. 6 ranked junior Eryn Cayetano, No. 42 ranked senior Salma Ewing, No. 73 ranked sophomore Naomi Cheong and No. 98 ranked redshirt freshman Snow Han. No. 65 Cayetano and freshman Grace Piper along with No. 46 Ewing and Han — a jump from No. 50 the previous week — make up the doubles court. 
The Bruins currently have three ranked athletes on the singles court: No. 28 ranked junior Abbey Forbes, No. 82 ranked senior Elysia Bolton and No. 120 ranked freshman Kimmi Hance. 
The duo of Bolton and freshman Elise Wagle are also ranked No. 49 on the doubles court. Forbes and freshman Ava Catanzarite also rank No. 56. 
The Trojans haven’t given up much at home this season, and Friday’s match will only be UCLA’s fourth away game. USC holds a 12-1 record at home. 
Although the Bruins have already defeated USC once, much has changed since their last matchup. As the regular season comes to a close, USC has won six matches in a row, including seven of its last 10. 
After two straight losses to UC Berkeley and Stanford, senior Danielle Wilson said the team got together to reevaluate and reset. 
“Something that we discussed as seniors … was just the will to win,” Wilson said. “We felt that was something we needed to touch upon a little bit right after Cal-Stanford weekend.” 
Since those matches, USC has turned its season around with the six-game win streak.
“We’re all fighters and no matter what, we want our opponents to feel that we’re never going to give up,” Wilson said. “Everyone wants to win, nobody wants to lose, so that’s not a problem on our team.”
Wilson said the UCLA game carries a great deal of weight to the team, as the underdog Trojans have an opportunity for redemption. 
“We’re capable of an upset, and we think that UCLA is a great opportunity for that,” Wilson said. “There are a lot of different factors that play into this match being super important other than the fact [that] we want to be the better L.A. school.”
Friday’s matchup will also mark USC’s senior day, where the team will honor Wilson and Ewing. 
“There’s a lot of emotions that come up when it comes to talking about the end of  my time playing as a Trojan,” Wilson said. “There’s a little bit of sadness, but  I’m also just really hungry to get out there.” 
USC faces UCLA in a rivalry rubber match Friday at 1:30 p.m.

After a strong showing at the Pac-12 North Invitational this past weekend, No. 1 USC beach volleyball heads north to San Luis Obispo to take part in the Center of Effort Challenge tournament. 
The Trojans enter the tournament riding a 22-dual win streak, four of which came from this past weekend against Pac-12 rivals, including sweeps of No. 9 Stanford, No. 17 Arizona and Oregon. USC’s only dropped point of the tournament came on a court three loss during a 4-1 victory over No. 12 Cal Saturday afternoon.
“Momentum is huge,” said graduate student Julia Scoles in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “It’s something that your energy dictates. Just making sure that you’re engaged in each play and engaged in each day and really just staying in the present … just work hard, and take each day for what it is — a blessing — and keep pushing forward.”
The Trojans will face No. 6 Loyola Marymount University, No. 13 host Cal Poly University, SLO, No. 4 Florida State and No. 3 UCLA.
Despite gearing up to face multiple ranked opponents, Scoles said the team remains unfazed.
“We just take it game by game and know that each one will be a battle,” Scoles said. “Regardless of who we play, we always have the mindset that anyone can win on any given day. So we just trust in our training, show up and give our opponents the most amount of respect by playing our best level of volleyball.”
Head Coach Dain Blanton said he enjoys the challenges presented by his team’s opponents. 
“We like to play the best so we can get better, and that’s exactly how we will use this weekend,” Blanton said. “We are getting to the part of the season when you are trying to put everything together, everything you’ve worked on to this point, and we’re slowly starting to refine it.
The Trojans have yet to play both LMU and Cal Poly this season. Sophomore Megan Kraft said the team isn’t paying much attention to the rankings of the teams ahead of the tournament.
“We expect to play great opponents, like always,” Kraft said. “It doesn’t matter how high they are seeded or not, because everyone is getting really good. So, just playing each other hard, elevating the level at practice always helps prepare against tough competition.”
With a short week to prepare, the Trojans are making the most of their practice time, focusing on serving and passing in order to force opponents out of their systems. 
The premier matchup for the Trojans will be their rematch with UCLA, who handed the Trojans their only loss of the season, a 3-2 defeat back in early March during the Battle for L.A. Invitational.
“It’s really exciting. Both of us have had time to develop and lineups have changed a little bit,” Kraft said. “We’re really excited to play hard and see what happens … We’re definitely keeping them in the back of our minds.”
Scoles said the team is treating itself as the “underdog” and has become more motivated leading up to the matchup against the Bruins.
“Having that loss under our belt made us hungrier,” Scoles said. “Anytime we play UCLA it’s always a battle … Let the best team win.”

No. 1 USC will host No. 3 UCLA Saturday at 1 p.m at home. With a win this weekend, the Trojans would clinch the regular-season MPSF title and the number one overall seed in the MPSF conference tournament.
The Trojans come off a win against No. 9 Arizona State, never trailing to the Sun Devils in a 15-11 win. The team sits at 16-2 overall and 5-0 in MPSF conference play on the season. USC will host the MPSF tournament the following weekend and maintaining its No. 1 overall seed would all but lock up an 18th consecutive NCAA tournament appearance.
This will be USC’s second matchup against the Bruins this season, with their last matchup taking place Feb. 13 at the Triton Invitational. The game ended in heartbreak for the Trojans, losing 11-10 on a game-winning goal with 23 seconds remaining. 
Head Coach Marko Pintaric said he believes the team have prepared well for this week’s game and beyond.
“This is where you’re trying to get in your rhythm,” said Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I know [the team] will be ready; they will do their studying and they will translate into the postseason.”
Senior utility Bayley Weber earned her second MPSF Player of the Week this season with her 3-point game against Arizona State. Her 2 goals on the weekend tied her for 18th place on USC’s all-time scoring list with 137. 
“We treat every game like it’s the National Championship finals,” Weber said. “We don’t overlook any opponent. Obviously [UCLA is] a rival, so we’re stressing that a lot in practices.”
Senior 2-meter Mireia Guiral will also look to have an impact on this weekend’s game. Guiral has scored across 13 games this season, nine of such games have been multi-goal efforts. She sits on the verge of joining the 100-goal club before the season ends, just 7 goals off of the milestone.
USC will also host its senior day Saturday, honoring senior utility Sophia Lucas, redshirt junior goalie Erin Tharp and redshirt senior driver Sabrina Garabet before the game.
“It’s their last game here, so we’re gonna play for them and try to make this day memorable,” Guiral said. 
In the history of USC women’s water polo, no team has beaten the Trojans more than the Bruins with 53 wins, but USC did have the last laugh last season, beating UCLA in the NCAA Championship. 
“We’re representing USC, and we want to win because of that reason, our rivalry,”  Weber said. “We want to take over L.A. and I think that’s a lot more motivation for sure.”
