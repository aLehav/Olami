USC University Hospital was ranked among the top one percent of hospitals in the country that perform heart transplants by an independent health care ratings organization, Monday.
The hospital received a Heart Transplant Excellence Award from HealthGrades, a health care ratings organization, which means the hospital has a significantly higher three-year survival rate than the national average and a waitlist mortality rate lower or not significantly different than the standard.
This was the first time HealthGrades identified the top-rated hospitals for organ transplantation including, liver, kidney, heart or lung, based on patient outcome.
Of the 141 hospitals reviewed for the same category, USC University Hospital was one of two hospitals to receive the award and the only hospital in Southern California to be included in the ratings.

Talk about a switcheroo.
The first 59 minutes of USC and UCLA’s annual cross-town battle Saturday qualified as a certifiable snoozer.
But, boy, did the sparks fly in the final seconds, when Bruins coach Rick Neuheisel called a timeout as USC attempted to run the clock out on a would-be 14-point victory.
Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
And that was all the provoking USC coach Pete Carroll needed, as he called on freshman quarterback Matt Barkley to deliver a 48-yard touchdown strike to receiver Damian Williams to break open the game.
That gave the Trojans the 28-7 win in front of a decidedly quiet crowd of 85,713 at the Coliseum, but it also brought nearly the entire UCLA sideline onto the field in what nearly ended up a brawl.
“That was just competing,” Carroll said in his postgame press conference.
Neuheisel said he didn’t blame Carroll for the decision to run a play-action pass up by 14 in the final minute.
Still, his players expressed surprise at the call that mirrored Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh’s choice to go for the two-point conversion two weeks ago against the Trojans.
“I was speechless,” sophomore safety Rahim Moore said. “They caught us off guard.”
The last minute demanded most of the postgame attention, but for much of the game, junior linebacker Malcolm Smith was the story.
He picked off a Kevin Prince pass in the first quarter and took it back 62 yards for a touchdown, providing the Trojans their only points of the first half.
Smith, who has missed three games this season due to a shoulder ailment, was also credited with 15 tackles in the game, a career-high.
“He was finally himself,” said redshirt sophomore middle linebacker Chris Galippo. “All year he’s been hindered by a few injuries and this and that but this is the one game that everybody got to see the real Malcolm Smith.”
Smith also stuffed three UCLA plays for a loss.
“He was all over the field,” Carroll said. “He played a beautiful game.”
As a whole, the Trojan defense held the Bruins scoreless until late in the fourth quarter, rattling both UCLA quarterbacks all game long. Redshirt freshman Kevin Prince and senior Kevin Craft combined to complete 18-of-39 passes for no touchdowns and three interceptions.
“We made too many mistakes, particularly on offense,” Neuheisel said.
It was a performance unseen out of the USC defense in recent weeks. In their last five games prior to Saturday, the Trojans had given up an average of nearly 35 points per game.
“Defensively, it was huge to keep the score down,” Carroll said. “We were able to adjust and keep things in order.”
UCLA’s first — and only — score came with fewer than six minutes remaining in the game on a direct-snap 2-yard run by senior running back Chane Moline.
That made the score 14-7, the Bruins’ best look at the game.
But USC responded with a methodical nine-play drive capped by a two-yard run by redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford, using up more than four minutes of clock.
Bradford ran four times for 30 yards on the drive — for a total of 62 yards on 14 carries in the game — and served as a decoy on multiple Barkley passes.
“We threw it when we had to and we used a little play-action here and there,” Barkley said. “When it counts, those are the big drives that you really need.”
For the much-maligned USC offense, the possession was a bright spot.
“I was really proud of the offense — that was their best drive of the day,” said offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates. “And we needed it. We had to take it down and get some points.”
And so the 79th meeting between the two teams ended exactly like last year’s, with the Trojans on top by a score of 28-7.
There will be no Rose Bowl for either Los Angeles school, but in what has amounted to a mediocre season for both, USC can again go home with bragging rights.
“It’s always good to beat UCLA,” Bradford said. “They play us tough every year regardless of whether they’re ranked or they’re not or what’s going in the season or how bad their record is or how bad our record is.”
“They always play us tough.”
Compared to other in-state rivalries across the nation, the so-called battle for L.A. has lacked in bravado since UCLA’s 13-9 upset over the Trojans in 2006. But the late-game antics this time around might have created something to look forward to for next year.
“It was good to see a little controversy, I guess you could say,” Galippo said. “Every other rivalry in the nation is like that, and it was good to see that here.”
It’s funny how pete carroll was whining and crying two weeks ago about Jim harbaugh’s “deal” of him going for the extra 2 pt conversion.  When in fact, what pete carroll did to the UCLA team this past weekend was 10x’s WORSE than that jim harbaugh 2pt conversion.  Even if weasel neihisel (however the hell you spell his name) took a time out, pete carroll, if he had any etiquete or class, would have ran the ball or throw a short pass for a simple 1st down. What really irked me about pete carroll, and really made me lose respect for that guy, was him jumping up and down while pointing “ahahaha” to the UCLA sideline to piss them off. That was VERY CHILDISH of pete carroll to do something like that!
I didn’t see Coach Carroll jump up and down while pointing “ahahaha” childishly, the videos don’t lie. I see you paint the picture with vindictiveness and straight out lies. Shame on you.
No Class Carroll typifies your no class institution.  Don’t whine about Harbaugh and then throw a bomb after taking a knee.  Loser.
LOL at the Ruins basketball team losing to ANOTHER non BCS school.

This one was ugly to the end.
Maybe it’s for the best that this showing was relegated to cable in a timeslot that would keep anyone on the east coast from watching. Those who did tune in probably flipped the channel before the conclusion.
Experiencing Saturday’s USC-UCLA game was as much of a struggle as the one that took place on the field. Stats could tell the story – the Trojans racked up more than 100 penalty yards and the Bruins turned the ball over four times.
USC coach Pete Carroll embraces quarterback Matt Barkley and receiver Damian Williams after Williams' 48-yard touchdown in the final minute of the fourth quarter. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
But all except for the last minute of this game will likely be forgotten. And it’s not just that the surprise strike to Damian Williams and the ensuing skirmish finally gave us something to talk about. It’s that the two most memorable moments of the night embodied the pulse of the rivalry and captured where both programs stand.
It’s just a shame that the rivalry manifested itself in such a hideous way.
Some have said that USC’s 48-yard touchdown pass with 44 seconds left with the Trojans up 21-7 was football’s equivalent of a middle finger to a despised rival. The move won’t be remembered for its social tact, but fans have cried that the Trojans were provoked. USC was content to run out the clock on an otherwise forgettable game, but the opportunity for another touchdown arose when the Bruins used a timeout to get the ball back.
“We’re not trying to run the score up,” running back Allen Bradford said. “We have respect for UCLA and they have respect for us. But we were trying to run the game clock out and they called a timeout, so I guess they wanted some more.”
As expected, Pete Carroll had a politically correct take on the play already crafted for the postgame press conference.
“It’s the heart of a competitor just battling,” Carroll said. “In the competitive moment, we went for it – and that’s it.”
There’s little doubt that competitive energy drove the decision, but don’t believe both parties when they spin this just as a matter of trying to win a football game.
No, there was plenty of ego involved in this. Quarterback Matt Barkley spoke after the game about being disrespected by the Bruins’ decision to take a timeout. It was clear that damaged feelings were a key component of the escalation.
Carroll and UCLA head coach Rick Neuheisel are perhaps too similar to be cordial while sharing the same field. The combative nature of their relationship is well-documented and it’s clear that there’s bitterness simmering below the surface on both sides. The postgame handshake between the two was as icy as the rest of the night at the Coliseum.
Maybe we should have seen all of this coming. By taking a timeout, Neuheisel opened himself up to the possibility of being lit up one last time. But the long bomb and subsequent celebration gave the Trojans an unbecoming aura of showiness.
Players shrugged off the incident afterward, saying that there was never a chance of a fight breaking out. And maybe the best part of the whole debacle was that a full-on melee never broke.
”We jumped around a little bit and then we saw them coming over,” said linebacker Chris Galippo, who avoided the potential skirmish by standing on the sidelines. “I just said ‘no one’s going to see me on YouTube getting knocked out.’ That was kind of on my mind, but I also didn’t want anything to jeopardize next week’s game.”
There’s little use in playing the blame game now. When viewed in isolation, both coaches’ choices seem innocuous. But somewhere along the line, cooler heads should have prevailed and one coach should have yielded in the name of sportsmanship.
Both coaches gush about the rivalry and its history. Yet instead of a memorable game, the lasting image of this game might be UCLA linebacker Reggie Carter knocking down an official in the post-touchdown fracas. Vitriol and animosity won out on Saturday and will reign until the next clash.
The good news for both sides is that they’ll get another chance at this next year.
How is what USC did any different than what half of the SEC teams do every weekend?  Look at #1 Florida.  They run the score up on division 2 teams, at least UCLA is a division 1 team.  SC was going to end the game but UCLA forced them to either turn the ball over or drive down field.  Who’s fault is it that Damien Williams was wide open?  You talk about sportsmanship, maybe you think we should hand out juice and cookies at the end instead of keeping score.  If you’re going to get all self righteous about something like this, then you should write for the fashion column, not sports.
Maybe Mr. Middlehurst-Schwartz needs to go to UCLA instead. You know what “compete” is?! Like Allen Bradford said, “So I guess they wanted some more,” which clearly indicates UCLA’s intention to “compete.”
I agree with Joe. Why are you so upset that we dominated UCLA? It’s what we do. Sorry if it hurts your feelings.
Who wrote this article? What a wuss! This is the spirit of the rivalry — beating the tar out of your opponents and sending them home crying.  This is what we live for!  I say it was a great show, best in a long time.

The story: What appeared to be one of the most uneventful USC-UCLA matchups in recent memory suddenly took an exciting turn when freshman quarterback Matt Barkley connected with redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams on a 48-yard touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter.
The touchdown cemented the Trojans’ 28-7 win over the Bruins Saturday night, but also almost started a brawl between the heated cross-town rivals.
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Up 21-7 with under a minute to play, USC was content to run out the clock, taking a knee near midfield. But UCLA decided to call one of its three timeouts to stop the clock in hopes of getting one more possession.
But USC coach Pete Carroll said his competiveness kicked in, and when he heard the call of a play-action deep pass come over the headset, he gave the green light.
“It’s just the heart of a competitor just battling, and in this sense in the competitive moment we went for it and that’s it,” Carroll said. “There’s nothing more I can tell you.”
Fair or foul?: USC’s decision to throw after UCLA’s fourth quarter timeout.
The outcome of the game was almost lost amidst all the hoopla following Carroll’s decision to throw deep with the game in hand. Carroll said he had no problem with UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel’s timeout after USC took a knee. And when he heard the call that would eventually lead to a touchdown, he was giddy.
“I thought it was a great freakin call,” Carroll said.
Carroll likened the call to Stanford Coach Jim Harbaugh’s decision to go for two amidst the Cardinal’s blowout of USC two weeks ago.
“I know Jimmy Harbaugh and he’s a great competitor,” Carroll said. “And I totally get it. So I didn’t have any problem with that.”
Barkley said the team was irked when UCLA called timeout.
“They can’t disrespect us like that,” Barkley said. “You could say they were trying to play the game, but if they wanted to keep the game going, then we did.”
Neuheisel said he was not offended by what USC did.
“Our job is to cover and they have every right to throw deep,” he said. “People can make their own conclusions. Our job is to stop the play… I don’t blame them for doing it.”
Nevertheless, Carroll and Neuheisel shared an extremely brief handshake after the game.
Nearly a brawl: Although Neuheisel said he had no issues with USC’s decision, some of his Bruins players certainly seemed to.
After Williams’ touchdown and the ensuing extra point, nearly the entire UCLA team came out to midfield, shouting at the USC sidelines. Multiple Bruins and Trojans had to be restrained as play was suspended for a few minutes. No punches were thrown.
Still, the Trojans said they were preparing for the worst.
“I put my helmet on and my mouthpiece in just in case,” Barkley said.
Redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford admitted he was in the center of the near-pandemonium.
“I was out there, I was in the front of it, I’m not going to lie,” Bradford said. “That’s just the type of player I am … I’m never going to start no fight but I’ll never back down.”
Momentum-changing play of the game: Sophomore linebacker Malcolm Smith’s interception return for a touchdown.
After both teams came out of the gates slowly, Smith helped USC strike first when he stepped in front a pass from UCLA quarterback Kevin Prince and took it back 62 yards for first score of the game.
“I was supposed to have man coverage, but I was peeking at the quarterback,” Smith said. “He was moving kind of slow to the flat and he just threw it at me. It wasn’t really anything special.”
It was Smith’s first touchdown as a Trojan.
“I just remember running right here and being like, “Oh, I’m about to score a touchdown,” Smith said.
Player of the game: Allen Bradford.
After starting junior running back Joe McKnight had to leave the game with a bruised left thigh, Bradford stepped in and received the majority of the carries. He finished with 70 yards on 14 carries with two touchdowns.
“It felt good being out there for that long and not coming out,” Bradford said.
I guess my blood runs Crimson and Gold, because the game time placed it here in KY from 10pm to 2:30am and I HAD to stay up and see it. I mean what Woman of Troy or Man of Troy wouldn’t?
 I remember a couple years back having a USC  hoodie on and a couple visiting the area (from LA) and our church saw me in it. After services were over, they approached me and said they were amazed and never expected to see anyone wearing USC colors in Kentucky. I just said “what can I say, I am a Woman of Troy”, USC goes where I go.
I do wish Pete Carroll and the entire Trojan team all the best for the rest of this season.
I KNOW that next year will be a stellar one for the team, as every football team across the US has “stubbed their toe” at one time or another.
“Coach” Neuheisel said that the two programs are not that far apart. I think he also said he believes in global warming.
