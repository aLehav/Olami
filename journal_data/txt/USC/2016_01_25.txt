The committee responsible for Los Angeles’s bid to host the 2024 Olympics announced on Monday that members of the media would be housed on the USC campus if Los Angeles is awarded the games.
Speaking at UCLA, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, who is leading the initiative to bring the Olympics to Los Angeles, said that Metro extensions and improvements will provide an estimated 21- minute transit time between USC and UCLA where the committee is planning on hosting the athletes.
Historically, the media has been banned from living in the Olympic Village, where athletes are free to focus and train unimpeded. Garcetti cited the benefits of both UCLA and USC’s campuses, mentioning USC’s proximity to both the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Staples Center, in addition to its strong journalism school.
This is not the first time Los Angeles has relied on its educational institutions in facilitating Olympic activities. In the  1984  Olympics, the  Coliseum became the first stadium to host the Summer Olympics twice, after initially hosting the Olympics in 1932.
The committee backtracked on a plan for a new Olympic Village-esque development that would have cost the city and state billions of dollars.
The initial tentative plan for the village, announced last year, would have placed it in a rail yard called “Piggyback Yard,” located in Lincoln Heights near downtown. The feasibility of the location was called into question, with concerns stemming from the cost of buying the land and cleaning it up.
“We want to build the facilities where the athletes could train and feel at home right next to where they were living during that time,” Garcetti said. “That’s what we have right here.”
The International Olympic Committee will announce its selected host city next year.  Los Angeles is competing with Rome, Paris and Budapest for the honor of hosting the 2024 Olympics.
Los Angeles 2024 Summer Olympics!

The USC College Republicans and USC College Democrats debated issues ranging from gun control to college tuition at the Political Student Assembly’s first meeting of the semester Monday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Aubtin Heydari, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television, and Zeke Sandoval, a freshman majoring in policy, planning, and development represented the College Democrats. The College Republicans were represented by their President Jacob Ellenhorn and Mary Perez, a junior majoring in political science. The panel was moderated by PSA Director of Political Content Sonali Seth, who is also the editorial director of the Daily Trojan.
The debate began with the topic of the economy. Ellenhorn emphasized the need to lower the income tax rate and help small businesses.
“We cannot see an economy that will grow properly because every day Americans don’t have jobs,” Ellenhorn said.
Sandoval responded by saying that measures such as an increase in the minimum wage and expansion of national programs are crucial to helping the economy.
“The Obama administration has done a good job of pulling us out of the recession,” Sandoval said.
The next topic was the issue of gun control. Heydari emphasized the need for enforcement of existing regulations.
“Currently there are enforcement mechanisms. However, we need a way for the Obama administration to actually enforce these,” Heydari said.
The College Republicans agreed that gun control regulations were necessary, especially regarding the mentally ill.
“Why are people who clearly have mental health issues able to obtain guns?” Ellenhorn said.
The College Republicans also emphasized the need for a free market to make health care more affordable.
“It simply is not fair,” Ellenhorn said. “The Affordable Care Act is not affordable, ironically.”
The College Democrats countered, arguing that the current health care system is helping millions.
“The Affordable Care Act is far from a perfect system, but it has helped a lot of people,” Sandoval said.
Climate change was the next issue discussed. The College Democrats favored climate change policies that would achieve energy independence and greater sustainability.
“If our world isn’t sustainable, how can we have a sustainable society?” Heydari asked.
The College Republicans took a different approach to the topic. Instead of focusing on the issue of climate change domestically, Ellenhorn turned his attention to conflicts abroad.
“We shouldn’t negate extreme dangers. China is out of control, ISIS is out of control, Russia is out of control,” Ellenhorn said.
The debaters concluded by talking about the increase in college tuition. The College Republicans emphasized helping youth by modernizing the education system. These solutions included reducing tuition through private investment and adding vocational schools.
“You see people pursuing ridiculous degrees. For instance, majors like Lesbian Dance Theory aren’t going to end with jobs,” Ellenhorn said.
The College Democrats argued that student debt should be lowered and that private investment would be inadequate.
“Investors are known for making safe bets, and they are not going to invest in a kid from a low-income area,” Sandoval said. “That investors are just not going to go for.”

One semester. That’s the time it took for six students to develop USC Eats, an iOS app that displays menu options for the day at the residential dining hall locations EVK, Parkside and Café 84.
The six students — Brian Anglin, Neel Bhoopalam, Jesse Chand, Arush Shankar, Riley Testut and Eric Wang — are members of “Blackbird,” a Spark SC committee formed at the beginning of the Fall 2015 semester for the sake of building internal tools for Spark.
According to Wang, a senior majoring in business administration and computer science,  the committee members felt limited by the scope of building internal tools only for Spark.
“Though doing this would help our friends throughout the organization, it wasn’t going to have the same visibility and impact that we wanted,” Wang said. “We wanted to build products that would impact the USC student body and beyond.”
The idea for USC Eats developed because of the availability of open data provided by USC. The team then developed the app with a “two-prong attack,” according to Shankar, a junior majoring in computer science.
Shankar worked with sophomore Brian Anglin on back-end development. Together, they formatted the data from USC before giving it to the iOS developers.
The iOS developers, Jesse Chand and Riley Testut, then designed the front-end of the app — the part of the app that users interact with.
“We’re partnering with USC so that the app stays up-to-date with relevant and useful information,” Shankar said. “There is also a mutual understanding that you can look online or use the app.”
The team was originally composed of all programmers. However, according to Wang, it “organically evolved” to become more of an interdisciplinary team, including designers and project managers as well.
USC Eats is the first project that the team did together. They, overcame obstacles associated with being a new team due to their common will to learn and make a big contribution, according to Anglin.
“My favorite part about working with the team is that I get to be surrounded by really smart people,” Shankar said. “There’s so much knowledge to go around that I’m always challenged to work harder.”
After the end of the fall semester, when the team came up with the idea and built the app, it was submitted to the Apple App Store for review.
“I’m really excited that we were able to create a solid product in the end,” Anglin said.
After the app launches, they will release an update which will include more features such as a favorites button. Users can favorite a dish they like and a push notification will appear on their phone the next time the dish appears in a dining hall.
In the future, the team hopes to build more apps that benefit the USC community.
“The next steps for our team are to identify projects that are really cool and start building these projects out,” Shankar said. “One of them has been a platform called ‘Tech LA’, which is a platform for finding internships in the L.A. area. We’re redesigning the whole thing and rebuilding it from scratch, so that the users can have a better experience.”
For now, Blackbird hopes they have set an example for others.
“This menu app is just one example of what USC students can do,” Wang said. “By building this app, we hope other people will be motivated and inspired to build their own projects on top of this data that USC makes readily available.”

The Undergraduate Student Government announced on Monday the establishment of an aid fund to support low-income student leaders on campus. The Positional Leadership Stipend is meant to help students who want to take on unpaid leadership positions without sacrificing income they may need to pay for college or other expenses.
According to USG Finance Director Edwin Saucedo, the idea for the stipend was first introduced when interviewing potential candidates for leadership positions in the USG Program Board. When one student was offered an unpaid assistant director position, rather than a paid director position, she had to decline because she would have to quit her job to have enough time to devote to the role. Saucedo developed the leadership stipend to help students in similar situations.
“USG directors and executive officers get a stipend for the work that they do, and we wanted to open the opportunity to be a leader up to students who don’t have that chance,” Saucedo said.
USG allocated $100,000 of rollover funds — which accumulated from unused programming funds over the past two years — to establish the stipend, which Saucedo and others are working to maintain for at least three years.
The application, which opened formally on Jan. 25, will ask students to explain how much money they need and why they need it. Although amounts granted will vary based on the position, Saucedo estimated that the stipend would generally pay students $10 for every hour they spent on their leadership position.
“We don’t want students sacrificing their activities so that they can pay for their basic needs, such as their food or their rent,” said Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath.
Although the stipend is currently reserved for students who hold leadership roles on campus, Saucedo hopes to eventually expand it to include students who want to play club sports or participate in greek life, both activities that often involve expensive dues and fees.
Furthermore, Saucedo’s goal is ultimately to include middle-income students and students with special financial circumstances — even if they are not strictly low-income — among those eligible for the stipend.
The application for the positional leadership stipend will close on Feb. 5.

Starting a business is no easy feat. It involves planning, making key financial decisions and completing a series of legal activities. Though every entrepreneur wishes their startup could be an instant winner, sometimes people need a little help. IncubateUSC is one place they can turn to.
IncubateUSC is a community of experienced students, staff, faculty and mentors on campus dedicated to providing resources that help students build great businesses.
With so many startup resources and incubator programs being offered on campus — including SparkSC, Startup Garage and D-Health Lab — Incubate USC streamlines the process by compiling all these campus resources on their website and also offering startup services like mentorship and support.
“Having seen and met with so many startups in the past year who all had similar needs, it just seemed logical to create a single online destination to point people to that would navigate Trojans through all the resources USC has to offer,” Jay Chang  said, one of the main venture consultants at IncubateUSC.
By consolidating the useful resources for starting up a business, IncubateUSC serves as a single portal for entrepreneurs to use. Whether it is securing funding for a venture, seeking pro-bono legal assistance or getting an experienced advisor or mentor for professional advice, IncubateUSC has catalogued all these different resources from across campus and  throughout the L.A. area to help venture-bound Trojans.
IncubateUSC provides two main services: free consultations and different start-up events and competitions to facilitate startup networking. The service that many entrepreneurs find most useful is its free consultation services.
Through its consultation services, entrepreneurs with ideas for a business venture can set up appointments with one of their venture consultants. After several appointments, students can get advice on where to get started and accomplish major startup tasks like putting together a business plan and learning how to speak with potential investors.
Most of the students who have sought the help of IncubateUSC just have a great business idea, while some already have a prototype for their business concept said James Bottom, the director for IncubateUSC. Nevertheless, within just the first meeting, students can emerge with a business plan and strategy all for free.
“No matter what stage of your venture, we pair you with a venture consultant with relevant experience or understanding of your business concept and help guide you through growing your venture,” Bottom said.
The venture consultants at IncubateUSC are composed of staff, faculty and mentors who are on and around the USC campus seeking to expand the next generation of startups at USC. Many of these resources are free because of provisions by USC and from collaborations with big companies.
“We also have partnerships with companies like IBM, Amazon, Google and more, providing thousands of dollars in credits for services,” Chang said.
Since its inception a few semesters ago, the program has reached out to nearly 4,000 students and worked with several active startups. IncubateUSC seeks to reach out to more students and alumni this semester.
Some of the wide variety of startups that IncubateUSC has worked with in the past include Freeform Labs, a company producing design software using virtual reality technology, Pulp Pantry, a healthy food company, and Sayy, a decision-making app.
IncubateUSC is seeking out more people with great ideas by highlighting its entrepreneurs via a series called “Startup Secrets.” The series will highlight the successes and students that have come out of the program and others on campus.

The Trojans men’s volleyball team (0-6, 0-4 MPSF) will take on No. 8 Pepperdine (4-1, 3-1 MPSF) at the Galen Center on Tuesday night.
The game will be the Trojans’ first as an unranked team since the end of the 2013 season.
“Honestly [ranking] doesn’t really matter,” senior libero and team captain Brooks Varni said. “We’re trying not to look at that kind of stuff yet. We’re more focused on how we’re gaining experience and how we’re learning throughout the whole season. We’re not here to worry about where we are in the rankings.”
On the other side of the net, the Pepperdine Waves have made quite a splash this season by starting MPSF play with a 3-1 record including a 4-set win over No. 4 UC Irvine in their most recent game.
To USC, Pepperdine is yet another ranked opponent in the way of the team’s first victory of the year and one with a variety of weapons.
Two-time All-MPSF second-team senior opposite Matt Tarantino leads the Waves in kills (3.50/set) while hitting .285 for the year. In an errorless performance versus Hawaii, Tarantino landed 13 kills on 16 attempts hitting .812.
USC’s answer to Tarantino is junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder. Two years ago, Yoder earned MPSF Freshman of the Year honors, but after a down year in 2015, he has been hot and cold this season. In Saturday’s match against UCLA, Yoder hit -.200 in just two sets.
Coach Jeff Nygaard remains impressed with his outside hitter’s natural ability and dedication to improving his game.
“[Yoder] is on a path where he’ll go out there and still pass naturally at the highest level,” Nygaard said. “He’s getting better across the board at everything that we do.”
The match will also feature a battle at the net between Pepperdine’s Tommy Carmody and USC junior Andy Benesh.
Carmody, a redshirt senior transfer from the University of the Pacific, has been a quick success with the Waves, leading the team with 32 blocks. As a team, the Waves have recorded 57 blocks to date and held opponents to 30.
Where Pepperdine has added a key player at middle blocker, USC has been missing star Benesh for most of the season. His absence accounts for the Trojans’ mere 37 blocks while opponents have racked up 64 against them.
Benesh returned to the court on Saturday at UCLA with a strong start to his season recording five blocks, six kills and a hitting percentage of .308.
“As you saw against UCLA, [Benesh] blocks balls, which is something we haven’t been doing much of,” Nygaard said.
On Tuesday, Benesh will square off with Carmody to try to mitigate the Waves’ size up front, but Nygaard knows that Benesh will embrace the challenge of Pepperdine’s size, a trait that “makes him who he is.”
Benesh also brings much-needed experience to the court after playing with the Junior Men’s National Team this past summer.
“The good thing about him playing on the international scene is that he played against some middles that were next level across the board: height, jump, physicality, experience and intelligence,” Nygaard said.
“It feels really good to be out there with my teammates again,” Benesh said, when asked about his return. “That first home game was hard for me to watch my teammates go out there and I couldn’t help support them, so it’ll be nice to get back out [at the Galen] tomorrow night.”
With Benesh back in the lineup, the Men of Troy have a big reason to keep their heads held high.
Varni has told the team, “[Our start] has not been ideal, but it’s really about sticking to the process. As frustrating as it is to be 0-6, we’ve got to stay positive.”
While USC has proven they can stay close with the best teams in the nation, to win versus Pepperdine, the team will need to start and finish sets better.
Varni blamed “inexperience” as part of the reason for the team’s inability to close out sets.
“Now with Andy back, it’s a whole new lineup, so I think we’re still getting used to one another and I think we’re going to have that experience as the season goes on about winning games,” Varni said.
The Trojans will gain more in-game experience with the new lineup on Tuesday against Pepperdine.
Another Haden hire which makes little or no sense. Nygaard part of the staff under Ferguson so why would he make a better coach? Taking the easy way out to promote an assistant who his playing days school didn’t want him to coach.

At a time when high school seniors across the nation are starting to hear back from some of their dream schools, one particular senior just ended a rather peculiar college search. Velus Jones Jr., a wide receiver recruit out of Saraland High School in Alabama, announced Saturday that he has committed to USC in the fall.
Saturday’s announcement wasn’t the first time Jones committed to USC — the 5-foot-11, 180-pound recruit said back in April that he had chosen the Trojans over a host of suitors that included schools like Notre Dame, Penn State, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina and Michigan. Still, there was one alternative that remained appealing to Jones.
On Friday, Jones swapped the cardinal and gold for the crimson and cream, as Jones announced that he was committing to Oklahoma.
No sooner had Jones committed to being a Sooner, than the three-star recruit changed his mind once again to return to Troy, stating in a tweet on Saturday: “I have made my final decision to attend the University of Southern California and I’m ending my recruitment FIGHT ON!”
The Trojans hope Jones can continue his success from his last two years at Saraland. In his junior and senior seasons, Jones gained more than 2,000 yards over 99 receptions, racking up 19 touchdowns in the process. After leading Saraland to Alabama’s Class 6A championship game and making an appearance in the Alabama-Mississippi All-Star Classic, his former head coach Jeff Kelly has good reason to give him a glowing review.
“I think Velus is a guy who can do a lot of things,” Kelly said to AL.com. “He can play both the inside and outside receiver. He can create different matchups, and he also is a guy who is very dangerous returning kicks and punts.”
Jones will likely join four other USC wide receiver recruits in the 2016 class, including Josh Imatorbhebhe from North Gwinnett High School in Suwanee, Georgia and Michael Pittman from Oaks Christian High School in Westlake Village, California, both of whom have already enrolled for the spring semester. The other two — who have not yet signed letters of intent — are Tyler Vaughns and Trevon Sidney, both hailing from Bishop Amat in La Puente, California.
The incoming class of receivers will hope to follow in the footsteps of recent Trojan greats like Robert Woods and Marqise Lee, and they will have at least one season with current star JuJu Smith-Schuster to show them the ropes.
All recruits have until National Signing Day — Feb. 3 — to finalize their commitments.

USC is an NFL factory.
rimsurrent NFL defensive stars Clay Matthews III, Brian Cushing, Rey Maualuga and Jurrell Casey were all members of the 2008 Trojans football team. So too were Tyron Smith and Jordan Cameron, two exceptional offensive players in the pros right now.
The 2008 season was bittersweet for the Trojans. A Rose Bowl victory over a talented Penn State side capped off a terrific campaign, but the national title game was seemingly within grasp.
Oklahoma fell to a Tim Tebow-led Florida team in the natty, leaving Trojan fans forever wondering what could have been. USC’s only loss that season was a 27-21 defeat at Oregon State in late September.
But alas, the playoff did not exist back then, so Sam Bradford and the Sooners got a shot at the Gators instead of the Trojans.
That USC team may not have won it all, but the roster was packed with future NFL greats. But with the passage of time, those future pro players have become the present. Clay Matthews is one of the faces of the league right now, but it is also important to note that he will be 30 in just a few months.
A new era of great NFL players is coming, and once again Trojans could very well be leading the charge. To find the next great Pro Bowl defensive tackle or a staple of a 2018 fantasy football roster, one might not have to look beyond the 2015 USC draft class.
Leonard Williams, one of Troy’s all-time greats, just finished a strong rookie season with the New York Jets. The Big Cat recorded 63 total tackles and 3 sacks, and he showed that he is capable of defending both the run and the pass at the next level. Williams was a joy to watch during his time at USC and is continuing to light it up in the pros. What makes Williams’ rise even more fascinating is that the Jets were quite respectable this season and nearly earned a postseason bid. Jets head coach Todd Bowles has his team on the right track and the sixth overall pick from last spring figures to be a key part of the renaissance in the Meadowlands.
Meanwhile, just an hour-and-a-half to the southwest, Nelson Agholor was busy putting together a sporty rookie campaign of his own. The 20th overall pick hauled in 23 balls for 283 yards and a score in 2015. While his numbers may not rival those of Oakland’s Amari Cooper or Minnesota’s Stefon Diggs, Agholor looks ready to explode sooner rather than later. The Eagles have been revamping the receiver position after parting ways with DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin in recent seasons. While Agholor was not the most statistically productive rookie wideout this season, his upside looks immense. He was targeted at least once in every game this season and could break out in 2016. Agholor, Jordan Matthews and Josh Huff compose a menacing group of young pass-catchers for Philly.
Javorius “Buck” Allen also enjoyed a solid opening season, rushing for 514 yards and a touchdown with the Baltimore Ravens. The former USC tailback got ample touches during the latter half of the season, including a 22-carry game against the Rams. While he never eclipsed the century mark in any games this season, Allen did haul in 12 balls for 107 yards and a score against the Dolphins in early December.
USC fans will recall just how dynamic Allen was in the cardinal and gold, especially because of his ability to threaten opposing defenses as a receiver. His reliable hands were on display for the Ravens this season, which is great news for signal caller Joe Flacco. Allen averaged 16 carries over the last two games of the season and should be a lynchpin of the Ravens’ rushing attack for years to come.
Though none of these three players got to play in the playoffs, they all showed promising signs in 2015. USC’s NFL pipeline is still thriving, and these three young playmakers all showed savvy and tremendous skill. Of course, Leonard Williams will continue to learn from his veteran teammates like Muhammad Wilkerson, while Agholor will grow alongside Jordan Matthews. Buck Allen will also be an interesting one to keep tabs on because he was quite the bell cow in some games for the Ravens this season.
The Trojans have another talented draft class in 2016, and history tells us they will continue to turn heads as they make the leap from college to pro.

While the USC student body was gearing up for the end of finals and heading home for winter break, more than 100 student-athletes spent Dec. 5 at 186th Street Elementary School in Gardena completing beautification projects around the campus. The trip was part of USC Athletics’ fifth annual Community Bowl.
This year the Trojans worked alongside the Wise Owls’ student body and mascot to make an impact on the campus and in the classroom.
In addition to the work the athletes did to improve the campus, each athlete was paired with an elementary school student from the beginning of the day to work alongside and to mentor.
The Trojan athletes were welcomed with a red carpet with students lined up on either side at the beginning of the day.
The athletes and their buddies completed 30 tasks over the course of the day. These tasks included digging and planting new gardens on campus, painting 10 murals across the school and revamping the school’s athletic facilities.
Nine women’s lacrosse players took part in the event, including junior attacker Michaela Michael who remembered what it was like to be an elementary school kid in the not-too-distant past during an interview with the athletics department.
“When I was little, seeing college athletes, especially from a school like USC, was so exciting,” Michael said. “Just talking to the kids, they think of us as celebrities. Getting to spend time with them is so special.”
In an interview with the USC athletics department, Principal Marcia Reed expressed her gratitude for the Trojans’ service.
“My students were so excited just to be a part of something like this,” Reed said. “This is one of those experiences that they will remember for a lifetime.”
In addition to the physical work that the athletes accomplished, they received the opportunity to speak with the students about the importance of education and staying in school. The athletes were able to work through a lesson plan with their students to teach them what college is like, what they have been learning and what their study habits are to promote higher education.
“Today was one of those experiences where the Trojans made us feel like we can conquer the world,” Reed told the athletics department. “The Wise Owls are going to soar. We want to make the Trojans proud.”
The Community Bowl is part of the Community Outreach Program, which is funded by The Otis Booth Community Outreach Endowment for USC Athletics. According to the athletics website, one of the main components of the Community Bowl is to “reinforce our athletes’ dedication to their community and its youngest members.”
The project is also supplemented by volunteers from the Trojan Athletic Parents Association who travel with the athletes to take part in their day at a local school.

Junior Nick Crystal was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week on Monday after recording two victories for the No. 8 men’s tennis team at ITA Kick-Off Weekend at Marks Stadium Friday and Saturday.
The Men of Troy defeated No. 57 UC Davis 7-0 on Friday and No. 37 Tulane 4-3 on Saturday in the championship match to earn a sweep and a berth in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships on Feb. 12-15 in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Crystal was a strong contributor to the successful weekend. The 41st-ranked singles player in the nation, he defeated No. 38 Alec Adamson on Friday with a dominant 6-1, 6-0 performance. That preceded a 6-1 doubles win along with Laurens Verboven over the Aggies’ Adamson and Adam Levie.
Crystal helped the Trojans earn a sweep and a spot in the championship match against the Green Waves on Saturday, where Crystal, a junior out of Waccabuc, New York recorded a clutch win over Tulane’s No. 63-ranked Constantin Schmitz to give USC a 3-2 lead in the match. After being shutout 0-6 in the first set, Crystal came back strong, winning the next two sets 7-5 and 6-2. The Trojans wound up with a gritty 4-3 victory over Tulane.
Crystal, in his third season at USC, also won a Pac-12 Player of the Week Award last year after another strong performance in the same tournament, winning two matches at the 2015 ITA Kick-Off Weekend. He went 10-5 in singles as a freshman and as a sophomore, earned All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention honors and was named to the ITA National Team Indoor Championships All-Tournament Team. The Trojans play Florida on Saturday in a Pac-12/SEC showdown at UCLA.

As the USC College Democrats and USC College Republicans addressed the rise in the cost of higher education Monday night, it echoed a greater national conversation — one which prompted even further dispute following the call for free undergraduate tuition by candidates for the Harvard Board of Overseers. The slate argues that given the university’s multi-billion dollar endowment, tuition should be free for Harvard’s undergraduates — a move that would make college more affordable and thus prompt more highly qualified applicants from diverse backgrounds.
Though providing free undergraduate education for all students regardless of their financial situation is impractical, universities with large endowments such as Harvard can and should do more to make college affordable for those students who need assistance the most — starting by installing free tuition for students from lower-income brackets.
In 2015, Harvard’s endowment reached a record $37.6 billion after posting a 5.8 percent return. The endowment — which is estimated to be equal to that of an average country’s annual gross domestic product — is composed of more than 12,000 funds. Financial aid for students is among Harvard’s largest funding categories.
Yet, like USC, this has not stopped Harvard from increasing its tuition to rates that far outpace inflation. In 2014, the university announced a $2,200 tuition hike, making it the largest tuition increase the university had seen in seven years.
With tuition increasing at unprecedented rates, free tuition for students from low-income families is not so far-fetched. In 2015, Stanford University — which boasts a $22.2 billion endowment — announced that it would begin offering free tuition to admitted students coming from families earning less than $125,000 annually. For families earning below $65,000, the university said it would throw in the cost of room and board.
Though Harvard is not exactly far behind its West Coast counterpart — it provides free tuition for families earning less than $65,000 annually — it and other universities with large endowments can do better. According to The New York Times, some lawmakers have proposed requiring colleges boasting endowments of $1 billion or more to dedicate at least a quarter of their annual earnings of tuition assistance. Such a move would not only address college affordability for lower-income families, but it would also ensure that universities’ endowments remain intact.
Opponents of free tuition do have an important point — a university’s endowment is not a piggy bank that can be dipped into when funds run dry. An endowment represents the amount of money and assets that are donated to a university and its purpose is to remain a permanent source of funding through the investment income it yields. But that does not mean universities with significant endowments cannot do more to dedicate their resources to financial assistance for those who need it most, without liquidating their endowments in the process.

Recent discourse surrounding the rapidly rising cost of college has increasingly led concerned students to question the source of the rise in price as well as upon whom the burden of the cost should fall. Proposed solutions have mainly centered around the federal government, ranging from capping the supply of federal student loans to federally funding tuition, as Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders notably endorses.
As evidenced by a recent proposal by the Board of Overseers at Harvard University, more and more policymakers and theorists are touting the idea that those responsible for managing the price point of tuition, the university, should be responsible of funding itself. The proposal, entitled “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard,” urges the university to allocate a portion of its $37.6 billion endowment for free education for low-income advocates regardless of race, leaning towards the more conservative viewpoint that affirmative action based on race does more harm than good and the more liberal opinion that higher education should be an economic right. Although the proposition that allocating a portion of a university’s endowment — which is usually valued in the billions of dollars — for free higher education seems obvious, it is ultimately another case of misguided economics attempting to solve a more structural problem.
Those who propose this solution fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of a university’s endowment. At a prestigious university such as Harvard, which produces the most economic and intellectual value through its graduate, doctoral and fellowship research, a large endowment is vital to securing the greatest resources to expand the forefront of academic knowledge. While we would like to believe that helping a brilliant first-generation student get a bachelor’s degree is of great value to higher education institution, that value simply does not surpass the tangible results of new research.
Even though there are dozens of universities with endowments in the billions of dollars — USC’s own reached $4.593 billion by 2014, over a $1 billion increase from its 2013 endowment value of $3.868 — it would not be economically wise for universities to dip into funds explicitly meant to securely pay for operating costs. Harvard’s own website says that it “must fund nearly two-thirds of its operating expenses ($4.2 billion in the fiscal year 2013) from other sources.” An overwhelming majority of a university’s endowment must remain intact in order to protect the school from inflation or other external economic stability. By risking the integrity of the endowment for the sake of providing free tuition for a few, a university funding free education with its endowment is jeopardizing the market value of the degrees of the entire student body.
The risk of dipping into an endowment would be cyclical. With a smaller endowment, a university has a smaller margin to protect itself with in times of external economic distress. This sort of emergency planning may seem extreme for universities with billion dollar endowments, which tend to be prestigious and centuries-old, but schools’ statuses have been decimated by having too small of an endowment at the wrong moment.
For example, Tulane University in New Orleans was once one of the premier research institutions in the South, but Hurricane Katrina in 2005 cost the school $650 million in damages and a priceless fall of prestige and ranking. Without a properly ambitious emergency fund in its endowment, it took until 2011 for all 16 of its Division I athletic teams to return and the same amount of time for admission to reach its previous levels.
By sticking to what an endowment does best that is — funding operational and other profit-yielding costs — donors can glean greater confidence from the school’s performance, providing greater sums back to the endowment, or even, yes, the independent financial aid fund, which would remain untampered with in times of a crisis.

And college isn’t for everyone. Why can’t this truth penetrate thick-skulled people? Knowing everything I know now, and if I was able to go back in time, I would only go to college for technical degrees such as STEM, med school, and related. All the peripheral stuff one can pick up at a community college, or other means, especially for much cheaper. The college experience has become sterilized and generic.

New research shows that first-generation college students often fall behind in grades and graduation rates. This calls into question the traditional narrative of the Trojan Family — a community in which all students are supported regardless of their family history. Indeed, it takes more than resources aimed at first-generation students for those students to succeed in a collegiate environment.
The greatest asset of first-generation college students is their background — which often offers racial and socioeconomic diversity. However, the culture of social and academic spaces favor a learned social prowess in lieu of qualities such as acquired knowledge or work ethic, facilitating a potentially adversarial, rather than inclusive, environment. By inadvertently disregarding the importance of social and cultural challenges, institutions of higher education such as USC allow campus climate to restrict these students from obtaining the “full college experience” critical in establishing networks with other students and professors.
This is not to say that first-generation students are incapable of success at institutions of higher education or that all of them face the same social and economic barriers. It would be far too reductive to conclude that first-generation students simply need their hand to be held in order to succeed because by gaining acceptance into college in the first place, they have proven to be more than capable of achievement. However, it is important to note that while success is not impossible, college life is catered to those who have been groomed and fine-tuned for academia throughout their development. Usually, continuing-generation students come from environments that bridge the gap between acquired knowledge, experience and norms, implied social rules and unspoken expectations of university life. It is certainly more difficult for first-generation students to adjust because they start at a significant disadvantage in comparison to their peers.
According to a Stanford University study, curriculum and subsequent discussion about class and racial differences can reduce the collegiate achievement gap between first- and continuing-generation college students. USC has a number of strategic initiatives aimed at helping first-generation college students, which includes a student task force, a college student-parent program, a mentorship program and a one- or two-unit sophomore seminar course. While early intervention on behalf of the University seeks to teach and enable students to better suit the demands of higher education, if the only resources are through student initiatives, the hostile social environment makes these skills pointless.
The standard USC class setup is not designed for first-generation college students, so while programs are helpful, students may be bogged down due to the non-inclusive and intellectually narrow curriculum commonplace inside the classroom. The issue is the culture of academia does not capitalize on what these students bring to the table — diversity of perspective and experience can be dismissed as trivial and consequently disregarded. Resources for first-generation students should not be confined to resources designed by the administration, but need to be solidified and integrated into all classroom environments.
Outside of the mentor-mentee program, the current attitudes, behaviors and expectations of other students create a campus climate not conducive to the needs of diversity and inclusion in social settings. First-generation college students make up about 14 percent of the student body, so the majority of college students are inherently socialized differently and possess a certain amount of privilege, which is often jarring and not understood by students who are the first in their family to go to college. If the sense of confidence and understanding is confined to mentorship spaces only, first-generation college students will be isolated in a campus climate that is cold and unwelcoming.
One of the selling points for admission is the promise of a private university with a comprehensive, closely-knit and accessible social network. For USC, it is the promise of the Trojan Family. To truly facilitate all members of the Trojan Family, it needs to be inclusive of students from all types of backgrounds, as well as address the social and cultural impediments that diminish the quality of education for first-generation students.

Experiencing Lita Albuquerque’s 20/20: Accelerando is like swallowing the vastness of the universe. 20/20: Accelerando, now on display at the USC Fisher Museum of Art, is a 26-minute video projection accompanied by a score and narration. Performers who dance and vocalize alongside the projection are interspersed among attendees, who find themselves meeting each other’s awestruck eyes as they scan between the performers and video projection.
The video follows an astronaut wrecked on an uncanny world as she journeys to learn the sacred wisdom of its indigenous people and unravels the secret geometry of the earth. The film is rich with astounding images of the natural world, a staple of Albuquerque’s style, augmented by a thundering soundtrack and narration in both English and a (subtitled) alien language, presumably of the artist’s creation. At climactic moments, the performers, two or three to a room, join in chorus to punctuate the soundtrack or break out in emotionally-charged laments in the unknown language. Their carefully choreographed motions allow the drama on-screen to penetrate the audience. That, combined with the deep, rolling bass of the film’s score, generates a hyper-lucid sensation akin to seeing a new color or acquiring a new sense.
The principle artist, Lita Albuquerque, is a Los Angeles-based creator known most recently for ephemeral works in the extreme parts of the world, including both the North and South Poles. She is on faculty at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. In an interview with Art Forum, Albuquerque noted that the installation is based on a 2003 piece she wrote in which a 25th century female astronaut lands in 6000 BCE Mali. Though the scenes displayed in 20/20: Accelerando appear to be real images of Earth, visitors to the installation are not offered a straightforward explanation of the actual site of the astronaut’s crash. Rather, in this exhibition, the artist invites viewers to witness the protagonist as an intrepid explorer of an uncanny almost-Earth who is to restore a forgotten memory of its ideal state, a mission cast as one of both heroism and personal enlightenment.
20/20: Accelerando imagines time and space in elliptical fragments; viewers are forced to surrender to an alternate geometry of reality in order to comprehend this new world. Rather than indict conventional spatial reckoning, Albuquerque’s installation transcends it. She invites viewers to turn not their world views but themselves upside down in order to make sense of a chaos that confounds intuition. Watching 20/20: Accelerando is like discovering how to close one’s eyes in order to better hear. The projection consumes a full, double-high wall of the gallery and the soundtrack is almost overwhelmingly loud, providing the senses with a cleansing inundation that recalls the first bite of cool water when swimming in the summer.
Though its artistic merit receives priority over its political significance, the installation’s use of generic native cultural tropes to encourage an enlightened return to nature might generate controversy. The protagonist learns indigenous wisdom from a local “medicine man” who instructs her by drawing in the sand and on the soles of her feet. (Both characters are white.) The performers’ voices begin as incantational whispers and rise to cathartic wails that recall the Na’vi war cries of the 2009 film Avatar. Attendees might register occasional discomfort during scenes when the idiosyncrasies of the fictional culture constructed by the exhibition eclipse its narrative.
Perhaps a more central thrust of 20/20: Accelerando is its conservationist message. The film collapses the history of Earth and the universe in order to pointedly portray the exceptionality of the present historical moment. Albuquerque presents modernity as a departure from, rather than a welcome outgrowth of, a past era in which humans lived harmoniously with all matter on Earth. Her installation challenges the modern insistence on technological “acceleration” beyond the natural pace of the evolution of life. Rather, the exhibition suggests, humans should allow the pre-technological elegance and brilliance of nature to guide social progress. In this light, 20/20: Accelerando is a delightful continuation of the Fisher Museum’s environmentalist tenor that began with last fall’s Gyre: The Plastic Ocean.
20/20: Accelerando is on display at the USC Fisher Museum of Art until April 10. The gallery is free to all patrons and open on all afternoons except Sunday and Monday. The installation’s relatively loud volume and mild on-screen nudity might make it unsuitable for children.

Whether it’s vintage or high-end design, local thrift shops, boutiques and flea markets in the fashionable downtown Los Angeles always sport a variety of hidden treasures. For anyone looking to add to their t-shirt collection, decorate an apartment or window shop on a lazy Sunday afternoon, these chic shops offer many unique styling choices.
One of the most distinctive places to go though, is the Artists and Fleas Market. On the third weekend of every month, head to the Arts District for a collaborative experience of art, design, original fashion and vintage as well. This collective of vendors is a gold mine, with their diverse offerings — whether it be handmade accessories, used books or vintage clothing — to bring people of all style choices back to those rebellious teenage years.
This one-of-a-kind shopping experience offers more than just that. There is also a variety of popular local food trucks that make appearances, as well as a DJ booth.
Returning for the beginning of the new year, Artists and Fleas debuted a variety of new vendors this past weekend. Spotlighted vendors have included Lockjaw Garage, Dig it Vinyl, Beatology Records and others such as Raditude Apparel.
One of the truly special aspects of this month’s market though, was the Will Wall. Customers were encouraged to write their new year’s resolutions on post-it notes and place it on the wall to create a sense of community and motivation.
Whether they’re looking for accessories, new or old music, or not looking for anything in particular at all, this market will prove to be a chest full of unimaginable treasures for everyone involved. One of the most fun parts of wandering around is undoubtedly finding an array of things that never seemed appealing until that very moment. And in that moment, it’s something that’s to be bought.
A few vendors really made an impression though, due to their creative values.
INKT Apparel uses simple tattoo designs on t-shirts to allow for interpretation by each individual. Their philosophy reflects an understanding of differences in perspective from person to person. Joe Saladino is the mastermind behind this bold California-made brand.
HollyWood and Twine signs will lighten up your home with their catchy and clever sayings. Artist and owner Amy Jorgensen hand paints each individual piece, to ensure optimal quality.
Red Panda’s purpose is to “bring warmth to cold products.” Their innovative bamboo phone cases, sunglasses and skateboards are creative and inspirational of natural warmth and beauty. The natural material the works are made out of is reminiscent of a time when nature was a much more prevalent than the technology we so love. Red Panda wants to begin to bridge the gap between nature and technology.
By Francis Frank offers handmade, locally-designed jewelry. Francis Frank is a college student, who pursues a separate passion for making bohemian inspired jewelry. Based in Los Angeles, her jewelry, like many other vendors at the Artists and Fleas market, is inspired and based off of Los Angeles and its wide variety of cultures and the people included.
Beautiful Things LA is a fantasy turned reality for owner Susan Forrest Reynolds. This unique mobile shop offers home decor and accessories through its fun bus storefront. The mother daughter duo, much like INKT Apparel, uses mostly California made and inspired items.
Trendy and Tipsy takes a new perspective on the fashion world: positive, fun, and upbeat. These are the qualities and attitudes of the women who wear this clothing, who will actively bring vivacity into mundane everyday activities. They offer a variety of vintage and original/new fashions.
For the book collectors and literature lovers, Brown Bag Books sells high-quality previously owned reading material. From comic books, to modern classics to encyclopedias, Brown Bag Books has it all at an extremely affordable price. The book company has been donating quality reading material to elementary and middle schools  in need for the past six years.
In addition to the large variety of apparel and jewelry, Artists and Fleas is home to many visiting food trucks.  TropPops are colorful and healthy treats made from whole pieces of fruit cut into fun and interesting “pop shapes,” then frozen and coated on one side  with flavors like chocolate and green tea. Other flavors include mango, pineapple, papaya, kiwi and banana and all Trop Pops are vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free.
Artists and Fleas is open on Saturdays and Sundays on the third weekend of every month from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The market travels to Chelsea, New York when it is not in L.A. While it is free and open to the public, the flea market hosts various fundraisers and craft shows that may charge  for admission.

Last weekend, I went to the opera. For most people in their early-to-mid 20s, going to the opera usually invokes imagery of black-tie attire and floor-length furs. However, for a perpetual opera-goer like myself, it was a typical Saturday evening in black chinos and a button-down. Attending the opera is an outing I find myself doing often, and more times than often, find myself doing alone.
Approximately five minutes before curtain, I was just getting settled in my seat when I received a text message from Roland, a guy whom I’ve been dating for about five months.
“Hey, what’s up?” his poetry read.
“At the opera. It’s about to start. Should be a good one,” I wrote.
“Fun,” he responded. “Hit me up when it’s over.”
My relationship with Roland is, at risk of sounding passé, complicated. We met at FYF Fest in August last year and have technically been dating ever since, but it’s been a constant seesaw of to-and-fro intimacy; he’s been insistent on keeping things casual, while I, being the perpetual romantic I am, have been striving for more substance. I’ve dated other men during our confusing tenure, and I’m sure he has as well, but we always seem to go back to each other in the end. There isn’t really a label to define what we are, a reality that suits him yet infuriates me.
This pattern of recurring casualness is also one that I am necessarily acquired to; normally, when I begin to detect that the other isn’t seeking something as serious, I’ll break it off and move on, but not with Roland. And despite repeated rejection from my friends advising me to distance myself from him, I kept going back.  And I keep going back to him because of opera.
You see, Roland was, and still is, the only romantic partner that I have ever taken to the opera. Likewise, Roland is also the first romantic partner I’ve had who has accepted my invitation to attend the opera. In past flings, when I’ve suggested the option of attending an opera performance, the responses have unanimously been the same: they’ll smile and give a vague response, with their politeness transparently masking their conspicuous apathy. Though it’s been disheartening, I understand that this art form is not everyone’s cup of tea, which is why I won’t press the issue. That’s why in November, when Roland enthusiastically agreed to accompany me to the opera, my heart swelled. He’s taking a liking to my interests, I thought. In that moment, I felt like our relationship had elevated.
The evening in which Roland and I attended the opera was monumental because it was the first time I’ve ever cried in front of a date. I don’t consider myself to be an outwardly emotional person; it usually takes some sort of colossal trauma to open that realm of my psyche. However, I find there to be a grand exception when it comes to opera. Maybe it’s because I find it easier to process my emotion through the lens of a complementary character, or maybe I’m just a schmuck for a decently-written melodic line; but I’ll always end up in tears by the end of a performance. This time was no exception.  And it wasn’t so much the tears itself that made this date so crucial- — it was the fact that I was comfortable with my own vulnerability. For the first time, I was not only able to experience this art form that I love so much with somebody at my side but was also able to cry in front of someone else without feeling any sort of embarrassment or remorse for my tears. On that night, my heart felt the size of the universe.
Fast forward to last weekend. It’s been two months since that magical evening at the opera, and Roland and I remain as casual as ever. Though I’m disheartened by the fact that our “relationship” has remained stationary in a limbo of quasi-commitment, I still find myself unable to cut things off completely. At any rate, I texted Roland after the performance, writing to him my thoughts and favorite moments of the performance in great detail.
“Awesome,” Roland wrote. “Sounds like it was a great opera! We should go again sometime soon.”
I smiled.

The world famous National Association of Music Merchants Show, took over the Anaheim Convention Center this past weekend. Music lovers from all across the globe gathered together to show off their new technologies, scope out the competition and meet some of the most innovative minds in the industry. Walking into NAMM is the equivalent of a kid at a candy store: The trade show featured four floors of expos of all varieties, from lighting rigs to interactive DJ gear and performances and appearances from big names in music, including Cage the Elephant, The Chris Robinson Brotherhood, Steve Vai and more.
The NAMM show first began in 1901 with a vision to strengthen the musical products industry in order to promote listening to and making music. Since its inception, the NAMM show has attracted vendors to create a music merchant community, as well as a community for musicians and professionals who work with the merchants regularly. Big companies like Yamaha, Taylor, Avid, Shure, Sennheiser, Moog and many others had remarkable booths that showcased more than just their products, but their company’s brand by providing unique user experiences at their booths. For example, Taylor Guitars had an entire room full of different models of their guitars hanging on the walls where anyone could come in, grab a guitar off the wall and play or see a variety of different performances. Performances in the Taylor room went on throughout the day, from country artists to singer-songwriters. Likewise, Avid, the creator of the music industry standard software Pro Tools, had several booths with different workshops throughout the days, ranging from Pro Tools basics to more advanced training on many different concepts. Pioneer DJ, known for their popular DJ gear, displayed many of their new products and had different workstations setup with tutorials so visitors could put on headphones and be instantly transformed into DJs.
Furthermore, any of the companies at NAMM that made instruments had their products on display at their booths so attendees could try them out on the floor, leading to some stellar, impromptu jam sessions. The convention floor was filled with sounds of horns, synths, and strums of ukuleles and mandolins alike. The loudest section was the percussion instruments. Drummers and percussionists quickly turned the area into a place where one could find them playing energetic and improvised solos or testing every type of cymbal imaginable. These experiences at NAMM gathered musicians, technicians and many USC students to learn more about the music industry, to network with industry professionals and to jam out with their fellow musicians.
“I went because I love seeing what’s new in music technology,” said Austin Foley, a junior majoring in music industry. “As a producer and instrumentalist, NAMM has everything that you want to see for the future of your career. To pass up on NAMM is like being one step behind the industry; you won’t know what new gear to get without its hands-on experience.”
While NAMM provides an array of different workshops and do-it-yourself activities, it is also a place to celebrate music by featuring live performances from a magnitude of artists. Attendees were treated to many different performances throughout the weekend, one of which was USC’s own Katie Stump, a senior currently majoring in popular music at the Thornton School of Music. Playing a 45-minute set, Katie graced the NAMM Acoustic Stage of the Sheraton Hotel Saturday night with her emotional lyrics and vibrant melodies.
Although NAMM showcases different technologies, speakers, microphones and instruments, at the end of the day, music is what brings the show together and creates a community within the music industry. Technology and its mechanizations will continue to change throughout the years, but what is certain is that the NAMM show will continue to promote the music community for years to come.

As fashion week begins — in New York, Milan, Paris and London — innovative designs are being displayed, and soon hitting the streets to be replicated.
Without having to closely follow each designer’s next move, we, as college students, are still aware of the most current, ubiquitous fashion trends. We live in a competitive fashion environment — sans the collegiate backwards cap and decorated sorority pullover. However, unless you have unlimited funds, attempting to emulate famous designs is next to impossible. The costs, along with the challenging “imitation” game we all undeniably participate in, explain our difficulties when we get to the checkout line.
We weigh the pros and cons: a critical moment for frequent shoppers who have to refrain from purchasing “questionably useless” items. No offense to Kanye, but when we accept his exuberant tennis shoe prices, we only feed into the problem. Therefore, in working within a budget, we need to adopt better methods to more frequently find affordable items. Finding these items requires looking at not only the obvious locations — H&M, TopShop, Zara, Forever 21— but also other stores, online websites and mobile apps. Here are some frequently used fashion companies that have perfected the ‘affordable runway’ mentality: Lord and Taylor, Light in the Box, Echo Design, ModCloth, Oasis and other brands, Lulu and, most importantly, Rent The Runway.
With more newly designed and personalized iPhone and Android apps, these stores are not the only avenues to explore. Designers, celebrities, performers, fashion gurus and politicians share their fashion favorites through the click of a few buttons. For example, the Kardashians have unquestionably capitalized on their countless connections in the fashion world in order to brand themselves as models, designers and, most importantly, promoters. On their apps — Kylie, Kendall — you will receive fashion and beauty advice, as well as where to buy the affordable versions of their clothing. Without encouraging Kardashian clones, I will say these apps allow for their fan-base to at least attempt to recreate la mode de Kardashian-Jenner. As you sift through their lavish lifestyles, remaining realistic can be challenging.
As prices only increase, you must know what you can afford, and then discover avenues to fulfill your inner fashion guru. The extremely expensive world of fashion is not going to get cheaper; therefore, it is your responsibility to locate the items you desire at a “reasonable” price.

Dear Tiffany, 
I’m really nervous about joining a frat because I heard they make you do terrible and gross things during pledging. How can I make sure I don’t have to compromise my values but still have a thriving social life?
– Nervous Nelly
Despite attempts to hide pledging lore away in dirty frat house basements, tales of plastic bottle liquor debauchery, Taco Bell binges and enfeebling physical feats (hey man, it’s for your health!) have long been perpetuated through the USC rumor mill. “Terrible and gross” are accurate descriptors of pledge semester for many — though definitely not all — greek fraternities. The only way to make sure you don’t compromise your values is to avoid houses that humiliate their new members for the noble sake of building character/bonding/proving themselves, otherwise known as “hazing.”
“Ugh Tiffany,” you say, “but I’m a guy and I can’t get into any parties, you just don’t get it, blah blah top houses blah!” 
Sometimes, it can seem like joining greek life is the only way to get in on the fun; after a semester or two, however, you learn this is a fallacy. The greek community at USC is certainly very established and has prolific social programming, but what if I told you that people unaffiliated with greek organizations also have thriving social lives? Greek students comprise around 25 percent of the undergraduate population, leaving the other over 14,000 students unaffiliated. These students frequent parties from 37th to 24th, Menlo to the ‘Zo. You can hang with the same kids at your Thursday night “Mathletes and Athletes” mixer, or you can meet greeks and non-greeks alike outside the confines of your frat house for $4,500 less a year! 
Some frats don’t degrade their new members, and these houses could be a great fit for you. But as your pledging semester commences, keep in mind you can always tap out with a blazing deliverance about integrity and a mic drop.

Word!!!!! 
Also, for anyone who reads this and feels like they’ve had difficulty making friends so far (especially freshmen): I definitely relate to that and think that feelings of disconnectedness are not as common as you may think. However, by the end of college, I had a very rich & healthy social life and supportive network of friends (both in terms of both quantity and quality). Many of my friends played a key role in my growth & development throughout college and my present life.
I think a huge part of what facilitated these types of rich friendships is my ability to be an individual and my friends’ abilities to be individuals, united by common interests/values who deeply respect amd value each other’s individual differences.
In terms of how this worked out in practice: my personal primary method for making friends was joining student organizations I was interested in. I think this worked out because 1.I met people who were attracted to similar ideas and activities, and 2. there was a reason to be there other than just making friends, which took way the pressure to “be someone these people would be friends with” and allowed us the space to just be ourselves.  I know people who went to USC who made friends through work or performance or study groups or taking fun two unit classes. 
If I were to give freshman-me some advice on making friends, I would say to prioritize being yourself and doing what you want to do (either because you enjoy it or it makes you proud, hopefully both), and the friends will follow in a way that makes sense for you.
to the ‘Zo!!!!1!
