Having trouble figuring out how to get to Columbus, Ohio for USC vs. Ohio State? Well worry no longer, as ESPN gears up to bring USC students stuck in Los Angeles the closest thing to being at the “Horseshoe” without traveling 2,000 miles from campus.
On Sept. 12, ESPN will premieres its long awaited 3-D football viewing experience at the Galen Center for the broadcast of the important game after more than two years of testing. The broadcast will feature cinema projection, large-scale arena viewing and LCD monitors to make the viewing audience at the Galen Center feel like it’s watching the game live.

ESPN will set up seven 3-D cameras in Columbus to capture the entire playing field and relay the separate feed to the Galen Center, along with other locations in Ohio, Connecticut and Texas. ESPN will also provide a separate team to call the game, with Mark Jones and Bob Davie to walk the audience through the first-ever 3-D broadcast of a college football game.
ESPN hopes this will serve as a instrument to measure not only how well the 3-D technology works, but also how fans react to the new broadcast style.
Tickets for the event will be free and are available from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at both Heritage Hall and the USC Ticket Center. Tickets will also be available at the USC football scrimmage at the Coliseum Aug. 29, at the first home game against San Jose State on Sept. 5 and at the Galen Center box office during two women’s volleyball games, Sept. 3 and 4.

With rulings coming down recently against top NCAA programs such as Memphis and Kentucky for violations, USC may not have made it through the summer unscathed.
On top of previous allegations of improper payments to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush and basketball player O.J. Mayo, two more accusations have been added to the list of potential violations against the USC athletic program this summer: surpassing the allotted coaching staff limits and a personal injury stemming from a car accident.
A recent Los Angeles Times story reported that USC may have exceeded limits on the size of their football coaching staff because Pete Rodriguez, along with Alex Gibbs and other coaches with NFL experience, acted as additional coaches by attending practices, observing games and offering head football coach Pete Carroll behind-the-scenes advice during Carroll’s tenure at USC.
During Pac-10 media day in July, Carroll discussed these alleged violations and claimed that Rodriguez and the others served the role of consultants and not coaches during Carroll’s eight seasons with the Trojans.
College football teams are allowed nine assistant coaches and two graduate assistants, but Rodriguez was not listed by USC as a coach last season. NCAA guidelines prohibit consultants from “any on- or off-field … coaching activities,” unless they are counted against a team’s coaching limit. Specifically forbidden is “attending practices and meetings involving coaching activities, formulating game plans and analyzing video involving the institution’s or opponent’s team.”
Carroll confirmed that his consultants stayed within acceptable boundaries in performing as consultants. Carroll claimed Rodriguez — one of his old friends — had not been “evaluating players. He just watched.”
Carroll also said USC assured him the NCAA had cleared Rodriguez and the other consultants before they were permitted to attend practice and give advice.
“We took the proper channels. That’s how we’ve always done it,” Carroll informed reporters. “Everything was all right.”
Meanwhile, a personal injury lawsuit that could run more than $500,000 has been filed against former USC assistant football coach Dave Watson, a local car dealership and USC. On May 17, 2008, Watson was the driver of a car that struck Alaric Valentin, the passenger of another vehicle. Watson, who was allegedly battling a painkiller addiction at the time, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. The suit claims that Watson had taken as many as seven Vicodin and several Soma (muscle relaxant) pills.
According to a recent LAist article, the lawsuit states that USC was negligent because the university provided the vehicle to Watson and “was aware of or should have been aware of [his] addiction to prescription pain medications.” The plaintiff, Valentin, also argues that USC’s own doctors knew about Watson’s addiction and had prescribed him pain medication.
However, USC’s General Counsel’s office believes that they do not belong in this lawsuit. Although Watson was employed by USC at the time (Watson left the team in January 2009), USC claims Watson was on his personal time when the accident took place.
Greg Patterson, an attorney who specializes in civil litigation in Los Angeles, told LAist that “an employer can only be held vicariously liable for wrongs that are within the scope of employment. This is determined by weighing several factors, such as whether the conduct benefited or was authorized by the employer, the nature of the conduct involved, and the time and place of the accident.”
Neither case has been fully resolved as USC continues to review the matters.

Let’s cut to the chase, freshmen.
You’re here, and you’re excited for football season.
You’re especially eager to cheer for the No. 4-ranked college football team in the nation, after you just spent four years’ worth of Friday nights supporting what was probably a mediocre high school team.
If you’re reading this, I’ll assume you’re more than familiar with the likes of head coach Pete Carroll and senior safety Taylor Mays.
So let’s dig into stories of some of the lesser-known players and stories that you’ll likely come across this fall.
Read up. There are 13 notes, one for each of the games USC is likely to play.
l First of all, one of your kind has already played a big role this preseason. Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley, still just 18, became the starting signal caller for the two weeks that Aaron Corp was out of fall camp with a cracked fibula. He has impressed teammates and coaches alike: Carroll called him “unusually gifted;” Garrett Green, a senior quarterback/wide receiver, said that Barkley has made “amazing mental progress.”
l Fall camp took place between Aug. 8 to 22, and, after a two-day break, actual fall practice started Tuesday. To briefly recap the noteworthy events, visitors to Howard Jones Field and Heritage Hall included Magic Johnson and Bill Withers of “Lean on Me” fame. Carroll also took the players on two surprise trips: an advance screening of District 9 at the University Village Theatres and bowling night at Lucky Strike Lanes at LA Live.
l The highlight of camp was probably a prank brawl staged by junior running back Joe McKnight and carried out by nearly the entire team. The coaches rushed to separate the players, and redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford and junior defensive end Everson Griffen were kicked out of practice for starting the fight. Then McKnight told Carroll he’d been punked. The 57-year-old coach promised revenge.
l The first scheduled game is against San Jose State on Sept. 5 at the Coliseum, but the first real one is Sept. 12 in Columbus against Ohio State. Expect the Trojans to be favored by about 35 points in the home opener.
l USC’s schedule is tougher than it was in 2008. The month of October, in particular, looks brutal: trips to No. 12 Cal and No. 23 Notre Dame followed by a home matchup with Oregon State. No. 16 Oregon will host the Trojans on Halloween in raucous Autzen Stadium.
l As far as the Coliseum goes, you’ll often hear “Big Balls Pete” chanted by a grinning student section, but don’t be alarmed. It’s the student body’s way of persuading Carroll to take the plunge in high-risk situations. Think fourth-and-one on the opponent’s 35-yard line.
l Also, don’t be alarmed when you look over in your general education classes this week and see a football player. It happens. If you see a bunch of them, it’s a good bet your class is going to be pretty easy.
l USC has five running backs who would likely start at the majority of Football Bowl Subdivision schools: senior Stafon Johnson, juniors Allen Bradford, C.J. Gable, and McKnight, and redshirt sophomore Marc Tyler. The sad part is that at least one of them will get lost in the shuffle.
l There are new offensive and defensive coordinators, but they both come from within the system. Rocky Seto has ascended from secondary coach to the coordinator on defense, and John Morton moves up from passing game coordinator to offensive coordinator. But neither of them will call plays, as those duties will fall — on offense — on new quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates, a transplant from the NFL, and to Carroll on defense.
l The four team captains: senior offensive guard Jeff Byers, senior safety Josh Pinkard, redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams, and Mays. Byers is the only repeat captain as he returns for his sixth year of eligibility.
l Another note on Byers: Aside from being the Gatorade National Football Player of the Year upon graduating high school in 2003 — the only lineman in history to win the award — he’s also a remarkable five years and one day older than Barkley. Incidentally, Barkley earned the same accolade in 2008 and third-string quarterback Mitch Mustain was the 2006 award winner.
l The quote of the offseason, thus far: “I don’t want my teammates to see me at a party, because then they might think it’s cool for them to be at a party,” Mays said to laughter at Pac-10 media day last month. “I have no problem sitting in my room looking at the wall. I’ll do that all day long if that’s what it takes for my teammates to see it.”
l For the first time since 2003, USC will not face UCLA in its final regular season contest. The Trojans will instead play Arizona to conclude the pre-bowl season on Dec. 5. What does that mean? Nothing, really.

In college basketball, where there are no contracts or no-trade clauses, a coach’s resignation from a team can have widespread effects beyond the simple fact that his presence isn’t felt the following season.
For the USC men’s basketball team, which is preparing for its first season since former head coach Tim Floyd resigned in early June, this ripple effect has revealed itself most apparently in the form of decommitments from several of the Trojans’ most highly touted incoming recruits.
Long road ahead · Coach Kevin O’Neill recognizes that the loss of recruits has shaken up the roster. -  Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
Point guard Lamont Jones, forward Derrick Williams and forward Noel Johnson all requested to be released from their letters of intent to USC over the summer after Floyd left. Jones and Williams decided to play for the University of Arizona and Johnson left for Clemson University. Forward Solomon Hill decommitted in April — around the time that Floyd was rethinking the USC coaching job — also to play for Arizona.
One of the biggest losses for the Trojans came earlier in the year, before the Floyd controversy. Center Renardo Sidney, a top-10 player who had received national attention for his formidable size (6-foot-10, 250 lbs.) and bruising style of play, decided to switch schools and commit to Mississippi State University.
USC’s initial acquisition of Sidney in late February led the wave of recruits for 2009, but questions regarding his amateur status and personal financial situation forced the Trojans to back away from their previous offer and part ways with him. Sidney also had academic eligibility concerns, but has since been cleared to play.
The absence of these recruits leaves an already depleted roster — which is without last year’s starters Taj Gibson, Demar DeRozan, Daniel Hackett and Keith Wilkinson — with little depth to turn to. Prior to Floyd’s resignation, the Trojans were ranked as high as 15th in ESPN’s NCAA basketball recruiting rankings, a figure that seems every bit a dream now compared to the nearly empty recruiting class that has stayed committed to USC for the 2009 season.
“We’re going to have major roster changes over the next three years, but that’s just the way it is, especially when you come in with essentially a blank recruiting class,” said new head coach Kevin O’Neill.
The Trojans will have only one returning starter for the upcoming season, and only four seniors on the entire roster.
But in every problematic situation there remains a silver lining, and the Trojans can certainly find theirs in the fact that they still have one recruit — 6-foot-7 small forward Evan Smith — to aid the rebuilding process for coach O’Neill.
“I love this university, I live in LA and I was born and raised here,” says Smith of his desire to stay at USC. “I’ve been committed since junior year, and I just didn’t want to leave.”
Smith represents something of a new breed for the Trojans: a solid player that won’t just jump into the NBA after one season, but stay and grow with the team over a period of time. He has already taken a liking to O’Neill as well, offering a sign that the Trojans seem to be heading in a different direction than the one Tim Floyd led them.
“We all love [O’Neill]. He’s the man,” said Smith. “He came in here and really got things started. We spent the whole summer training, and we’re all ready to play.”
Smith will join a young Trojan team led by senior and returning starter Dwight Lewis and redshirt senior Marcus Johnson as they compete for a second consecutive Pac-10 title. USC will open the season with a home game against UC Riverside on Nov. 17.

It was “Competition Tuesday” at Howard Jones Field for the first official practice of the fall semester.
And how fitting it was that redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp returned to battle freshman Matt Barkley for the starting quarterback spot.
Back in action · Aaron Corp (15), practicing for the first time since cracking his fibula, must beat out Matt Barkley for the starting spot. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
Corp, recovering from a cracked fibula in his left leg, didn’t appear limited as he moved around in the pocket.
“It was about as full speed as I could be,” Corp said Tuesday. “I can do everything right now that playing quarterback at USC needs me to do, and it’s only going to get better.”
Carroll denied saying that Tuesday was the day Corp needed to return to be considered to start the season opener on Sept. 5 against San Jose State.
Still, he agreed that it was important for Corp to return to practice.
“This is a big step for him,” Carroll said. “He’ll get a chance all the way to Saturday to show where he sits. I think that’s a very important opportunity for Aaron … but there’s no deadlines.”
Saturday is USC’s mock game, scheduled to take place at the Coliseum at 12:30 p.m.
Corp initially suffered the injury when redshirt sophomore linebacker Shane Horton rolled into his leg during a scrimmage in fall camp on Aug. 10.
“I’m a little nervous, first day back,” Corp said. “I have to prove myself all over again and continue to play well and play like I’m capable of [playing].”
Corp said he took “a few” snaps with the rest of the first-team offense. The rest went to Barkley, who threw two interceptions.
Barkley was picked by safety Drew McAllister on a mid-range pass out of the pocket and threw a would-be pick-six to defensive end Everson Griffen on a screen pass.
“I didn’t really have the right read on it,” Barkley said of the play that resulted in McAllister’s interception. “We’ll try to improve on it, but I don’t know how long that play will last.”
In Corp’s absence, the 18-year-old Barkley largely impressed but did have a few performances befitting his age, like a 5-for-13 day in the first scrimmage of fall camp on Aug. 13.
“Having him out here kind of does challenge me a little more,” Barkley said. “It makes me try to play harder, but I don’t feel any more pressure because he’s out here.”
u
Carroll announced during a team meeting Tuesday that senior Jordan Congdon will be the starting placekicker for the season opener.
Congdon, a 22-year-old transfer from Nebraska who sat out last season, beat out redshirt junior Joe Houston in a competition that appeared neck-and-neck throughout fall camp.
“This is just a new start,” Congdon said. “Joe’s gonna be there all season. If I’m not doing my job, I know they’re not gonna have any problem putting him in. I wouldn’t have had as good a fall camp if he wasn’t here.”
Carroll said the decision wasn’t based on just one factor, although Congdon did appear to knock down a higher percentage of his attempts in recent practices.
“I thought Jordan separated a little bit here in his numbers,” Carroll said. “We kept track of everything they did — the timing, all that stuff, and Jordan finished with considerably better numbers.”
Congdon was a first-team Freshman All-American with the Cornhuskers in 2005, going 19-for-23 on field goal attempts and 31-for-32 on PATs.
“I’ll have some decent game exposure,” Congdon said. “I had two years there, so I’ll be going into the game with confidence that maybe a guy that didn’t have all the reps that I had in games wouldn’t have.”
u
Tight end Blake Ayles missed practice Tuesday while recovering from a minor heart procedure.
The sophomore had surgery Monday to steady an irregular heartbeat.
“They went in and they fused something out,” said Ayles, who missed all of spring practice with a knee injury. “It was a trip, the whole experience. They touched my heart. It was real weird.”
Ayles said he would practice Wednesday.
u
Congdon and redshirt junior safety Robert Erickson were awarded scholarships Tuesday. Carroll had praised Erickson’s performance on more than one occasion during fall camp.
Carroll said that junior Jacob Harfman would handle kickoffs this season. Harfman, a transfer from Mt. San Antonio Junior College, is also competing for the punting job with redshirt junior Billy O’Malley.

How many people in the world can boast that Bob Dylan said  they were one the most prominent poets of the 20th century? How many can say they met The Beatles before they caught America by storm? How many can say they discovered Michael Jackson’s talent and knew he would be one of the greatest entertainers of our time when he was only 10 years old?
All of these distinctions belong to R&B legend Smokey Robinson, a true entertainer in every sense of the word.
Groovin’ · Iconic Motown artist and producer Smokey Robinson sings before an intimate audience at the Grammy Museum. Robinson’s newest album, Time Flies When You’re Having Fun, was released this week. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
On Monday night, the Grammy Museum hosted An Evening with Smokey Robinson. The museum’s intimate auditorium was full with enthusiastic music connoisseurs and diehard fans of the musical legend.
It is rare to see a crowd so simultaneously exalting, honoring and pleasing; even before Robinson graced the stage, the audience was rising to its feet and applauding. People were ecstatic about being in Robinson’s presence yet at the same time, listened attentively when he spoke.
Not one to suffer from stage fright, Robinson responded to each question asked with either a colorful anecdote or an insightful statement concerning his varied musical experiences. From his time as a singer in the Miracles to when he retired briefly as vice president of Motown, Robinson enchanted and amused everyone by illustrating one of music’s most interesting periods.
During the 1960s, America enjoyed one of music’s most interesting periods when music producer Berry Gordy started a small music label in Detroit called Motown Records. Soon enough, artists started to blossom and become what we now consider the foundation of soul music.
“In every place in the world there is the same amount of talent, ratio-wise,” Robinson said. “It was just that, in Detroit, we had Berry to capture it.”
Growing up in “the hood” — as Robinson referred to it  — and being a part of Motown Record’s first major musical act, Robinson befriended Motown heavyweights such as Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross and members of The Four Tops. While working as a producer for the label, Robinson had to face the decision to temporarily reject The Temptations because they were too young; the only young artist Motown Records could take on was an up-and-coming Stevie Wonder. Robinson also became close to Marvin Gaye, who was not only his fellow artist, but his “brother brother.”
But those were just some of the bigger names to come from Detroit’s music scene of the time. Robinson highlighted the importance of receiving a break by acknowledging the musicians who never found the opportunity to shine — not because of their lack of talent, but because they were simply not at the right place at the right time.
When asked about Michael Jackson, Smokey said he saw this “little bundle of talent” when Jackson was still with the Jackson 5, and immediately knew Jackson was “something else.” Smokey also stressed the extreme psychological damage a young child experiences when he loses a parent, and said the media should stop scrutinizing the King of Pop’s children.
As a producer, VP, songwriter and artist, Robinson captured the essence of an innovative era of music that crossed genres and transcended racial segregation — and, at 69 years old, the R&B legend shows no sign of slowing down. Robinson’s newest album, Time Flies When You’re Having Fun, was just released this week. The title speaks to Robinson’s extensive career in the music industry, for even he cannont recall the exact number of albums he has had produced.
After the interview, Robinson delighted the audience with a live performance, which consisted of songs from his latest album as well as classics such as “The Tracks of My Tears.” Robinson enamored everyone present and truly proved that, by following the rules and etiquette of conventional show business, you can entertain the masses for a lifetime.

Just last night, I was sitting in a cafe when — briefly, so quietly — I instinctively leaned forward in my seat to catch the faint melody of: Now this is a story all about how / My life got flipped, turned upside down / And I’d like to take a minute, just sit right there / I’ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.
What came next was remarkable: conversation stopped, cups smacked onto tables, newspapers rustled and every head went searching — “Where, oh where, was it coming from?” A man in the corner, alarmed at the sound, whipped out his cell phone — ah, it was the ringtone! — and opened his conversation with, “You would not believe the looks I am getting right now …”
End of the story: He received a free latté and two numbers from decently attractive ladies. The second woman, a tall brunette, said to him as she punched her digits into his phone, “I loved Fresh Prince. God, who didn’t? Doesn’t listening to that theme song just make you so nostalgic?”
If I were to give my number out to every person who loved Fresh Prince, pickings would be aplenty. But she had one thing right: Nostalgia falls the heaviest on my consciousness when I hear the jumble of notes, whistles and words of a show’s opening credits. Regardless of the disappointing episode that follows or the pathetic cliffhanger that preceded it, the show’s theme song becomes a living tribute — not solely to the program itself, but to every afternoon or evening spent in front of the living room television.
Years from now when I hear the chipper keyboard of The Office, of course I’ll remember Jim’s irresistible lopsided smirk and Dwight’s Mussolini speech. But most of all, I’ll recall the weekly ritual of my group of friends cramming seven bodies onto one stiff, oddly stained couch when nothing seemed more hilarious than sitting at a desk of a failing paper company.
The moments of my life I remember best are the trivial ones — the mundane times that are so soaked in familiarity that I ache in their absence. Somehow, these moments are best captured through the brief opening credits of my favorite television shows, and I know I’m not alone when I say this. My college days will always ride that Scranton keyboard, summer will echo in my head like the lighthearted ba-ba-ba’s of How I Met Your Mother and the I’m No Superman of Scrubs will always evoke the senioritis that pervaded every blistering, wonderful day of my last year in high school.
But it runs deeper than glancing a few years back into my adolescence. These tunes manage to capture an essence of my childhood, the very joy and electric thrill I felt as a kid, naïve about life outside the ’burbs. Who can honestly hear the opening percussion of Boy Meets World and not feel like Corey racing down those stairs, eager and ready to  meet the world head on?
Admit it. Raise that hand — you were Corey Matthews.
Whenever I’m placed in the potentially dangerous situation of strangers awkwardly fumbling for a conversation, I have a few lifelines ready. The fourth and last, the one I will share with you now, is the most reliable option I have come to perfect. Softly, but distinctly, in the deafening roar of silence, I will hum the opening theme to Doug. In nearly every instance, someone’s ears will perk and their eyes will rush towards mine and they will whisper, as if confiding a dirty secret, “I loved that show!” Nothing breaks the ice like reminiscing over the golden decade of the ’90s.
Do you remember chanting “Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill!” every day after school, thinking that Einstein had nothing on you? Or shouting “Hey!” with Arthur while he jumped from page to page? Or singing Gotta catch ‘em all! and really, really hoping that no one found out you had a stash of holographic Charizards? And whose heart doesn’t sigh just a little bit when a soft voice rings out, What would you do if I sang out of tune? To this day, my concept of love is forever idealized through those opening lyrics.
Wait, I think we just bonded.
The truth of the matter is these classic theme songs — and all the current day theme songs that will one day become classics — are common ground. They are the Holy Grail of icebreakers (and, apparently, of getting free coffee and dates for Saturday night) because they have the same effect on all of us, the same warm splash of nostalgia that lingers like rain on the bottom of your jeans.
So here’s how we resolve disputes in the world: Have every child ever born grow up watching the same shows. Determine your next significant other by the ringtone he or she has — I will date Reading Rainbow, but won’t touch Thundercats with a 9-inch stick. International conflicts? Over. Marriage? True love.
Ah, did I just save the world? And I say hey, (hey!) / What a wonderful kind of day…

Inglourious Basterds, like most of Quentin Tarantino’s movies, is a death-filled, genre-mixing masterpiece. Unlike most of Tarantino’s films, however, it flips history on its head and turns a rewritten demise of Nazi Germany into a neo-noir-spaghetti-western-turned-war-film-revenge-flick that is as satirical as it is high octane.
The movie follows several developing plots to kill top Nazi leaders at a film premiere in Paris during the height of World War II. The protagonists are a rag-tag team of Jewish-American soldiers that only writer/director Tarantino could concoct. Led by a wily, Southern-accented Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), the Basterds — which include The Office’s B.J. Novak and Freaks and Geeks alum Samm Levine — race through Nazi-occupied France wielding “apache tactics,” ambushing uniformed Germans and scalping the dead bodies.
Battle royale · Inglourious Basterds marks Academy Award-winner Quentin Tarantino’s war film debut. Set in France during World War II, the film follows a group of Jewish-American soldiers, led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) as they seek brutal revenge on the Nazi regime. - Photo courtesy of The Weinstein Company
Pitt is perfectly cast as Lt. Raine and elements from several of the actor’s previous characters — like Fight Club’s organizer Tyler Durden, Burn After Reading’s clueless Chad Feldheimer and Snatch’s pikey Mickey “One Punch” O’Neil — show through in his portrayal. With a blend of brutality and dark humor evocative of previously explored Tarantino troops like in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, Raine’s crew is a hybrid of previous creations.
To counter Tarantino’s harsh-yet-likeable men-on-a-mission archetype, the filmmaker juxtaposes his screenwriting fantasies against the harsh reality of World War II. Using real events such as D-Day to frame the film in a proper historical context, Basterds lunges headfirst into the delicate subject of Nazi Germany and, unlike Mel Brooks’ The Producers — whose flamboyant Führer is an obvious Hitler-mocking allusion — takes the task of depicting the axis leaders seriously and without regard for the easily offended.
Historically accurate Nazi regalia is rampant throughout the film and oversized giant red wall banners bearing 30-foot tall swastikas hang in many scenes. Tarantino cast native German-speaking actors for all Nazi roles, but despite appearances by Hitler in a velvet cape and Joseph Goebbels’ sex face, it is fictional Col. Hans Landa — also called “the Jew Hunter” — who stands out as the movie’s main antagonist. Played by Austrian-born Christoph Waltz, Landa breathes new fear into the Nazi with hypnotizing small talk, a sinister grin and piercing eye contact that forces his victims into submission.
Tarantino movies are often overhyped, drawing viewers in more with A-list talent and excessively aesthetic death scenes than actual enjoyability. But Basterds is the Tarantino movie for non-Tarantino fans. Followers of his previous films will easily spot the filmmaker’s touch in drawn-out-for-suspense dialogues and hard-to-watch moments — like when horror-porn director Eli Roth (acting as Sgt. Donny Donowitz, “the Bear Jew”) blows open a Nazi officer’s head with a Louisville Slugger. But most of Tarantino’s influence is more subtle, hidden in character names and scenes which pay homage to his favorite B-list movies.
More than 10 years in the making, Basterds is Tarantino’s magnum opus. It eschews typical Tarantino gore overload — well, some of it — for foreign language dialogue and authentic Nazi uniforms, but still retains the director’s unique brand of violence with a smirk. It rewrites film genres as much as it reimagines history.
With more last-minute plot twists than One Night at McCool’s, Basterds is Tarantino’s thesis statement to the essay of his repertoire.

The term “ethnic violence” is used so often in relation to African tribal disputes that it is easy to forget to ask exactly what that term means. For Rwandans, it meant that relations between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes became so bad that genocide followed. The same can be said today for tribes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Yet for many years, Kenya was held as a shining example of how African nations could rise above the many tribal disputes. The problem is, tribal conflicts can’t be solved easily — even when the government is able to maintain order.
Monday, Kenya introduced a controversial census to gauge just how many members of each tribe are living in different regions of the country, among other statistics. Officials argue that it would be irresponsible not to learn the tribal makeup of Kenyan society. Arguably, with such information, the current leadership could stand up against rival politicians who come up with false numbers for electoral purposes. Yet, many fear that opening up old wounds will only lead to more violence within communities still trying to heal.
Eighteen months ago Kenya dissolved into tribal warfare, and some 600,000 people fled their homes because of an electoral dispute. In the following months, thousands of Kikuyus, members of the power-holding tribe, were killed and many are still displaced. During the conflict, farmers were forced off their lands, which resulted in the current maize industry crisis facing the country. After two seasons of little-to-no crop yield, officials estimate that 10 million Kenyans are now at risk of starvation.
The government claims that it does not have enough money to continue giving out seed grants to farmers so that they can rebuild their lives. Still, others speak only of corruption and greed, as politicians continue to profit while Kenyans go hungry.
Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga are now ruling together as heads of the new multiethnic government. This helped relieve tensions for a time, since both of Kenya’s major tribal populations were represented. There have been no efforts, however, to end the resentment between the tribal groups on the ground. Historically, the disenfranchised Kalenjin have always felt belittled by the Kikuyu despite their ethnic majority within Kenya, and economic disparities within the country have not helped matters.
In the current political crisis, the census will be a good way to gauge how populations within Kenya are recovering and rebuilding their lives. It is meant to shed light on issues such as education, fertility and mortality levels, and migrational patterns. Tuesday was even declared a public holiday to encourage as many responses as possible.
Yet at the same time, the government is doing a massive security overhaul, which will last the entire week of the census. As important as good information may be, it certainly doesn’t seem worth sparking another wave of violence, which could easily lead to even more displacement and suffering for Kenyans. And even if all goes smoothly and the census does yield useful information, it will not have solved the tribal conflicts which are at the root of Kenya’s troubles.
For the moment, the multiethnic government might not feel that it has any incentive to end the tensions — after all, the same tensions brought Odinga and Kibaki to power. As with many corrupt governments, there is a large profit to be made (even from starvation), and the only real objection is coming from external human rights groups and foreign governments.
But those within Kenya worry that if more is not done to help the two tribes reconcile and gain long-term equality, violence will surely break out once again. And surely, no one will profit from that in the end.

There were a lot of things to worry about this summer, for the anxiety-prone. A recessed economy, a miserable job market, the persistent recurrence of swine flu cases and the death of our nation’s most beloved crazy person made lounging on the global warming-heated beach almost stressful.
As though worrying about whether the cabana boy would remember your drink order wasn’t taxing enough.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
Even with all this on our minds, the mass media couldn’t stop themselves from alerting Americans to the one epidemic that we hadn’t been spending enough time worrying about: cankles.
Cankles made an inordinate amount of headlines this summer, even on CNN, where coverage of Michael Jackson’s death and postmortem extravaganza occupied so much air time that the producers nearly had to export certain stories (“A Retrospective of Michael Jackson’s Vegetable Gardens,” “The Desperate Difference between Baby Dangling and Baby Dangling”) to the Home and Garden Television network.
A piece in the normally staid Wall Street Journal in July kicked off the media cankle craze, although it seems that cankles were first brought to national attention during last year’s presidential election, during which Hillary Clinton was accused of possessing them.
For those unfamiliar with the wide range of nicknames applied by insecure women about various aspects of their bodies, a cankle refers to an ankle that lacks definition from the calf, and instead blends into the higher part of the leg, forming a chubby stump.
The Wall Street Journal, in response to the seriousness of the trend, actually used a definition from urbandictionary.com to define the term. Strangely, the Journal did not use the Urban Dictionary definition of mortgage (“That weight around your neck that will never be alleviated until you: (1) DIE or (2) eventually pay off by the time you are 107.”) in a recent article about the fiscal crisis.
Granted, the article, titled “For the Body-Conscious, It’s Now the Ankle That Rankles,” was written by the same journalist who in early August wrote an article suggesting that Barack Obama was too skinny to lead the country because his workout program and lack of interest in sweets smacked of elitism to the obese masses.
But as soon as the Wall Street Journal printed the 1,120-word story on the front page of its paper, ABC followed with a story headlined “Cankles: The New Muffin-Top?” and Katie Couric even addressed the issue at the end of her broadcast. Gold’s Gym, in a tongue-in-cheek marketing effort, even declared June to be Cankle Awareness Month.
All of the news stories about cankles were at least slightly self-aware, as if the journalists writing them were perfectly conscious that insecure women are old news, but that a story about cankles would generate attention because cankles are a funny concept with a mildly clever nickname, like “frenemies” or “Obamamania.”
But because journalists must make their stories at least ostensibly newsworthy, each article also contained a slightly more disturbing component — namely, that there are women out there who really are worried about cankles.
So worried about cankles, in fact, that nutrition and fitness experts are showing up on the Today Show to tell Matt Lauer (a man who has surely lost the ability to produce testosterone) the best ways to tone those chubby stems.
These women are so worried about their ankles that when they lose hope in their ability to define their calves through exercise and diet, they pay $6,000 for ankle reduction surgery.
And of course, even though both men and women posses ankles, it’s never the men who obsess about how to best flatter, disguise, improve or reconcile with their unsightly lower limbs. The stories all focus on women who feel defeated by a body part that goes largely unnoticed by everyone but themselves.
Perhaps while President Obama works to reform our health care, he can work on creating an HMO that will cover cankle alleviation. But by this time, the media will have told women to worry about something new: Sausage fingers! Flappy ears! Uneven toes!
We’re better off trying to cure swine flu.

USC’s Undergraduate Student Government held its first senate meeting of the year Tuesday, with senators discussing a proposed student discount program and laying the groundwork for the semester’s initiatives.
USG has been in talks with the Student Savings Club, a company that partners with local businesses to provide college students with discounts on food and other services,  USG President Holden Slusher said at the meeting.
Students would have to present their USCards, at participating businesses, such as Office Depot and the L.A. Live restaurants, to receive these discounts.
Slusher provided the senators with a sheet including restaurants and businesses that would tentatively be a part of the plan, with most showing 10 percent discounts.
To implement the Student Savings Club program, USG would have to pay the company an annual fee of $1,700, Slusher said while introducing the initiative to the senate.
But the senators’ approval of the measure would not directly cost students any money or result in a raise of the student programming fee, he said. Instead, the money would come from Senate allocations, funds left over after USG finishes distributing money to its various programs.
Some senators expressed concerned about getting the word out to students about the discount program, but Slusher said USG would promote the program on its website and participating outlets would have signs to inform students.
The Senate will vote on the measure next Tuesday.
In addition to the Student Savings Club program, USG hopes to enact more initiatives over the upcoming weeks to improve student life at USC. Some of the initial projects being discussed included a tram to L.A. Live and the addition of more equipment and longer hours at the General William University Lyon University Center, according to Ashlie Chan, vice president of USG.
“It’s still in the gray area, but we’re getting the ball rolling and we’re really excited,” Chan said. “I know that Holden and I have a really great administration. As long as we’re working towards what students want, that’s all we can ask for.”
She added that they would also be working on the expansion of two-unit course offerings and the ability to transfer football season tickets from student to student.
Slusher said he was optimistic about USG’s ability to make its proposed initiatives realities, citing the improvements to the Lyon Center as one area he hopes to significantly impact.
“The biggest thing for me is that students and student government don’t back down on anything, [that] we have faith in ourselves not to back down from a big project,” Slusher said. “Going big pays off.”

Virginia Ramo, USC alumna and Board of Trustees member, died Aug. 19 of natural causes. She was 93.
Famous at USC for her enthusiastic philanthropy, Ramo and her husband Simon donated and fundraised more than $310 million over a 40-year period for the USC Flora L. Thornton School of Music.
Although Ramo graduated with a bachelor’s degree in education in 1937, she had a lifelong passion for music — she played the saxophone in a women’s orchestra while at USC and throughout her life referred to Thornton as “her” school.
The Ramos gave $1 million to build the Virginia Ramo Hall of Music, dedicated in 1974.  Last year, Ramo gave money to renovate a practice room in Booth Memorial Hall, which has been renamed performance facility Simon Ramo Recital Hall.
Thornton Dean Robert Cutietta said Ramo truly exemplified a committed member of the Trojan Family.
By funding two of the most important buildings in the music school, Ramo Hall and Ramo Recital Hall, Cutietta said Ramo provided students with the specific facilities they needed.
“She stayed very dedicated and very involved, both through her donations and her time,” Cutietta said. “She has a very real and concrete impact on what the students do here every day.”
Ramo’s distinguishing characteristics were her attention to detail and willingness to act as a liaison between Thornton and the greater Los Angeles community, Cutietta said.
“Virginia would give me advice and she would take the time to make sure that everything was always taken care of and that important introductions were made,” Cutietta said.
Ramo and her husband endowed the Ramo Music Faculty Award in 1971, which provides one Thornton School of Music faculty member each May with $10,000 to support professional development.
“The Ramo Award is considered to be the most prestigious faculty award in the Thornton School of Music,” said Dorothy Ditmer, director of personnel for Thornton. “She was so interested in what was going on with faculty and students.”
Larry Livingston, who served as the Thornton dean from 1986 to 2002, said when he first met Ramo in 1985, he was deeply impressed with her role as a passionate and loyal friend of the school.
“She was one of the most important figures in the entire exterior part of the university,” Livingston said. “This is a significant loss because she was a historical figure in the evolution of the university.”
Ramo and her husband were also passionate about contributing to the Keck School of Medicine, Cutietta said. She extended her support to programs ranging from annual giving to medical research at her alma mater.
In 1999, the Keck School of Medicine’s Board of Overseers saw its first year under the guidance of the Ramos, who served as the Board’s inaugural co-chairs.
“Mrs. Ramo’s contributions as a member of the Keck School of Medicine of USC’s Board of Overseers are invaluable,” Keck Dean Carmen A. Puliafito wrote in an email. “Her impact on the Keck School of Medicine and USC will not be forgotten.”
Ramo also served as the USC Board of Trustees vice chairman from 1986 to 1991.
A fundraising campaign she co-chaired for the university’s centennial raised $309 million between 1976 and 1980 — a university record at the time, the Los Angeles Times said.
Ramo received the Presidential Medallion, the university’s highest award, in 2002, the USC Thornton School of Music’s Founders Award and numerous other university accolades.
Ramo is survived by her husband, two sons and four grandchildren.
Memorial services for Ramo will be held on campus later this fall.

Elizabeth Garrett doesn’t like to rest on her accomplishments.
Earlier this month, California Secretary of State Debra Bowen nominated Garrett to the Fair Political Practices Commission, the state’s political watchdog agency, for her expertise in campaign finance reform, election law and political ethics.
Watchdog · Elizabeth Garrett, vice president for academic planning and budget at USC, will be working to oversee public officials’ practices. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
Garret, 46, says she shares the attitude of USC, where she teaches law and works as vice president for academic planning and budget.
“Our attitude is, ‘We’re a great place, but we can always do new and different and better things,’” she said.
Despite all the papers Garrett has written and the classes she has taught about the regulation of the political process, she said doesn’t feel she has accomplished enough.Bowen disagrees.
“Professor Garrett is a perfect fit because she has both academic and real-world experience in the issues the FPPC tackles every day,” Bowen wrote in an email. “She has an outstanding legal background.”
The commission was started in 1974 to enforce the Political Reform Act, a ballot initiative to regulate conflict-of-interest law for public officials.
Once every month, commissioners meet in Sacramento to vote on recommendations made by 80 full-time staff members about conflict-of-interest law for public officials.
Garrett said she wanted to see how the issues, which she has studied and written about for more than 15 years, play out in the real world. Her first meeting with the commission will be Sept. 10.
“This is a terrific opportunity for me to have a sense of the practical effect of the work I’ve produced or been aware of as a scholar,” she said.
The commission will make enforcement and legislative decisions about gifts that public officials receive, how public officials are financing their campaigns and lobbyist registration.
Although Garrett has always been interested in law and the political process — her father, who she has always admired, was a lawyer — she graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a B.A. in history.
After earning her J.D. from the University of Michigan, Garrett worked for US Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and Sen. David L. Boren — both of whom she said helped refine her knowledge about the political process.
She said her studies and subsequent political experience also taught her that problems are complex and that they are a product of the context in which they arise.
“As one deals with problems, you have to take into account the behavior and the reactions of the people who are regulated,” she said.
Robert Rasmussen, dean of the Gould School of Law, said it is obvious to him why Garrett was chosen for the commission.
According to Rasmussen, Garrett always listens and gives reactions to what people are saying — she never preaches.
“She’s not dogmatic like, ‘Here, I’ve found the answer.’ She’s much more, ‘What’s the problem and what can we do to solve it?’” he said.
Katharine Harrington, dean of admission and financial aid who works closely with Garrett, said she would be a great addition to the commission because of her commitment.
“She has a work ethic that would put anyone else we know to shame,” Harrington said.
Rasmussen agreed with Harrington’s assessment.
“You get more out of a half-hour conversation with Beth than you get out of a two-hour conversation with most people,” he said.

Meron Begashaw had found a school she loved.
And thanks to a $16,000 financial aid package, she attended USC last year as a freshman with a major in health promotion and disease prevention.
“I’m just blessed to have spent my freshman year at a school that I love,” Begashaw said.
But this summer, Begashaw looked at her financial aid package to discover she was only receiving $3,000 — a $13,000 cut that came at the same time her dad’s income dropped 20 percent.
She appealed to financial aid — stood in lines, made phone calls, sent letters.
In the end, though, Begashaw decided the process wasn’t worth it.
She left USC for a year at community college, and hopes to transfer to a UC next year.
“It was hard for me to come to that decision,” she said. “I felt like I was going to regress in my education, but I think I did the right thing.”
Begashaw wasn’t the only USC student faced with tough decisions this summer.
The  financial aid office changed its formula for calculating aid this year — increasing the maximum loan amount and adjusting the expected student contribution based on the current minimum wage.
Those changes, though not drastic for most, went unannounced. Many students received an unpleasant surprise when their financial aid packages were posted and, when they tried to discover the root cause, found it hard to get through to the financial aid office, creating unrest throughout the student body.
Katharine Harrington, dean of admission and financial aid, admitted this year’s changes, combined with poor document handling, created a perfect storm for the financial aid office and students looking for aid.
Harrington described the problems as a “snowball effect.” Phone lines were tied up, she said, because so many students called about misplaced documents, so when others called, they found themselves on hold for long periods of time.
“My customer service operation was swamped, and it went from there and it just kind of got worse,” Harrington said. “We also shot ourselves in the foot with some very poor document handling.”
Jon Willbanks, a junior majoring in business administration (cinema-television), found himself a victim of both the changed formula and the imperfect customer service.
“Financial aid … really made it possible for me to come to USC,” Willbanks said. “But because of some small income from a summer internship, it altered the way our numbers plugged into their formula … which raised the amount of money we owe by a much larger amount than the extra income.”
Though Willbanks is still attending USC, he found himself looking for extra sources of income at the last minute. Adding to the frustration, Willbanks said he has not been able to get an answer from USC as to why his aid dropped, despite multiple phone calls, emails and faxes.
Students like Merisenda Bills, the administrator for the Facebook group “USC Students Face Financial Aid Uncertainty,” didn’t receive their packages on time, and were told their documents had never been received, though the error was often on the part of the financial aid office itself, Harrington said.
It was the fact that so many students ran into problems with the financial aid office that prompted Bills, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism, to form the Facebook group in July. The group quickly skyrocketed to 1,500 members.
Problems faced by the group members run the gamut — from not receiving enough money to not receiving financial aid packages until midsummer to claims of missing documents to complaints about the lack of prior notice.
Harrington, who met with the administrators of the group soon after its inception, said she recognized the problems students on financial aid have faced this summer. She said the financial aid office has worked to correct the problems, and will be doing even more work as the year goes on.
“I apologize for it and we are working very, very hard to make it better,” Harrington said. “It’s a real problem.”
For fear that students might leave USC — as Begashaw did — because of frustration with this year’s financial aid process, Harrington said her staff personally reached out to all the continuing students who were on financial aid and had not reregistered. Based on those phone calls, Harrington said, it appears that few students have had to withdraw. She said, however, even a few leaving the school is too many.
“For the majority of students, we did get it right, but it’s not OK with me if we mess it up for even one, and we messed it up for more than one,” Harrington said.
Harrington said most problems arose not from the changes — made after a comprehensive review to financial aid policies — but from poor execution.
After meeting with the administrators of the Facebook group, Harrington said she learned how crucial communication is to the successful operation of the financial aid office. Should changes to the financial aid calculation process be made again, Harrington said her annual letter to parents will detail these changes. She will also be meeting with students to determine the best methods of communication.
Bills said increased communication was a key concern for many students.
“A lot of it was things that may seem clear to them don’t seem clear to us,” Bills said. “… I think if they would’ve been clear, students would feel less angry.”
Other, bigger changes are also on the way, Harrington said. All financial aid documents will be handled by processing, the department that currently handles admissions documents, so students will never have to deal with their papers being lost.
Financial aid is also planning to remodel Hubbard Hall and hire a call center manager to streamline the phone customer service.
Administrators of the Facebook group — which students said seemed to bring the problem to the attention of the university — said they were pleased with the outcome of the meeting with Harrington, but still disappointed the problem occurred at all.
“We had to have a group of 1,500 people before they put [the changes] on the website,” said Jayson Davies, an administrator of the group and a junior majoring in occupational
therapy.
Harrington said the financial aid office is working to correct its mistakes and that it appreciates input from students.
“It hurts me personally when we find ourselves in these kind of situations,” Harrington said. “Our university commitment to you all is unwavering and all of what I do is very, very important to me to be done well — it’s the work of my heart.”

For some sorority members looking for housing on The Row, living in the Theta Xi house seemed like a good choice — until construction on the house fell behind.
Though slated to be completed Aug. 1, construction on the Theta Xi house was delayed by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency until the end of September. With the holdup, the students who had leased spots in the house — members of Theta Xi as well as members of various sororities — have been forced into the Radisson for the first weeks of school.
Locked out · Students walk by the Theta Xi fraternity house on The Row. The house is still gated as construction continues, weeks past the scheduled date of completion. - Alejandra Vargas-Johnson | Daily Trojan
Construction on the house started earlier this year, but the CRA stepped in and halted construction, hoping to preserve the house’s original 1908 construction.
Eric Foss, president of Theta Xi, said the fraternity had received permission to reconstruct the house from the city of Los Angeles, but they never contacted the CRA. Foss said the CRA stepped in as soon as they heard about the reconstruction.
“The CRA came in and they said, ‘You changed the house, you have to stop working,’” Foss said. “That’s where we’re at right now.”
Despite Theta Xi’s efforts to complete the construction in time, the CRA halted all advancements because it did not approve of changes made to the façade of the house.
“We’re held up in the conversation of safety versus style,” said Foss, a senior majoring in critical studies. “We have to change the style of the front of the house a little bit because it wasn’t structurally sound. That’s the reason [our house was condemned] in the first place [by USC], because we were breaking fire codes.”
Foss said negotiations with the CRA are pending.
The CRA could not be reached for comment.
Though construction is now nearing a close — students should be able to move in before the end of September, according to Nick Wright, vice president of Theta Xi and a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering — those who had planned to live in the house are currently staying in the Radisson.
Theta Xi currently has 13 active members and four alumni waiting to move in. They are also renting out spots to about 30 other people — including members of the Delta Gamma, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa Alpha Theta sororities.
Katie Kroopnick, a member of Delta Gamma, said moving into the Theta Xi house is a good alternative to living in the DG house because of the difficulty finding a spot there. She added, however, that temporarily living in the Radisson has been an inconvenience.
“Everyone else has been able to get settled and we’re living out of suitcases,” said Kroopnick, a sophomore majoring in sociology. “The Radisson isn’t really set up for students. There are no desks and no Internet.”
Jonathan Gilde, secretary of Theta Xi, said the house delay has caused an inconvenience with the fraternity’s rush plans.
“We have to put in a lot more effort to make rush happen,” said Gilde, a junior in the interdisciplinary major program. “To make a great rush, it’s really making things difficult.”
Gilde said rush is proceeding as usual, but the members must bring supplies over from their rooms at the Radisson, which makes the process more difficult.
Presently, the members of Theta Xi and the other students planning to move into the house are paying for the Radisson through several different means.
As part of the contract with the construction company, the company must pay a penalty fee for every day they continue construction past the original Aug. 1 deadline. Wright said the fee money, donations from Theta Xi alumni and rent payments from the eventual inhabitants are being used to pay the Radisson rent.
Though residents will be moving into the house in about two weeks, finishing touches — such as installing carpeting and painting walls — will still need to be made.
