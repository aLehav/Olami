USC Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas is retiring, Senior Vice President David Wright announced in a communitywide memo Monday. 
Thomas, who worked on improving officer training standards since his appointment as DPS chief in 2016, will remain in the role until a nationwide search for his replacement concludes. Thomas was also involved with the DPS Community Advisory Board and DPS Cadet Program. Under Thomas, every cadet who graduated from the program continued onto college, with six attending USC.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Thomas said he believes the DPS Cadet Program is his biggest legacy. The program welcomes first-generation students from the surrounding community to USC to learn about the value of a college education. Since 2014, each student who went through the program went on to attend college. 
“Over the course of 15 years, I’ve met so many great students and I’m still in contact with some of them,” Thomas said. “I think I just fell in love with that atmosphere and knowing how instrumental I was in keeping them safe and just getting to know them.”
Thomas also recalled his first days working with DPS, feeling daunted by high crime rates and a large student body in what he described as a “chaotic” system. While he said he didn’t plan on staying longer than two years, Thomas said he’s glad he did. He felt ready to retire this year, having “confidence” in the Community Advisory Board.
“USC has afforded me so many great opportunities,” Thomas said. “ It’s one thing to be the chief of the DPS, but it’s another thing for students to still stay in touch … . That’s amazing to me and that’s something I think I would have never got to experience.”
David Carlisle, assistant Chief of DPS, said that Thomas has been a very well respected chief through his work of keeping students safe and investment in community outreach initiatives.
“Chief Thomas and I are friends as well as colleagues, we have worked together at DPS since late 2006,” Carlisle said. “We both worked together for the last 15 years, and we’ve seen a lot of positive changes at DPS under his leadership — both as a captain, as the assistant chief and the last nine years as chief. We made a lot of improvements for a lot of great people from the department.” 
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated that Chief John Thomas started the DPS Cadet Program. Chief Thomas was involved with the DPS Cadet Program. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

According to the Los Angeles Times, ex-USC women’s soccer assistant coach Laura Janke testified Monday in the nationwide college admissions scandal trial related to the Operation Varsity Blues case. She took the stand in Boston, where she provided additional testimony to the specifics of her involvement in the case of former casino executive Gamal Abdelaziz and former Staples and Gap Inc. executive John Wilson. 
Janke was a USC employee from 2007 to 2014. She falsified profiles for unqualified athletes to help them gain admissions into the University. These profiles included exaggerated accomplishments and Google images. The former assistant coach said she oftentimes didn’t even know if the students she made profiles for played a sport.
Janke’s testimony was directly related to her involvement in helping Abdelaziz’s daughter by creating a fake profile claiming she was a recruit for basketball. In reality, she hadn’t even made her school’s varsity team. Abdelaziz is charged with paying $300,000 for his daughter to gain admission to the school under this guise. 
 “I had to make it believable enough without raising any red flags,” Janke said.
Janke conspired with William “Rick” Singer, the man who supposedly coordinated the nationwide scandal. 
In May 2019, Janke pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy to commit racketeering. In exchange, she agreed to testify in court in return for a lenient sentencing.

Congresswoman and USC alumna Karen Bass announced her candidacy for Mayor of Los Angeles Monday, pledging to address the homelessness crisis by focusing on “root causes,” including affordable housing, health care and mental health service, according to her newly launched campaign website.
Bass, who graduated from the USC Keck School of Medicine physician assistant program and received her masters of social work from the USC School of Social Work, has served in congress for more than 10 years, representing CA-37 — the congressional district that includes University Park Campus — since 2012.
“With my whole heart, I’m ready. Let’s do this — together. I’m running for Mayor,” wrote Bass on Twitter Monday.
Bass grew up in the Venice/Fairfax area of Los Angeles, co-founded Community Coalition — an organization dedicated to improving economic conditions in South L.A. — and served as a state assembly member representing L.A. from 2005-2010. She delivered USC’s 136th commencement speech in 2019.
The congresswoman currently serves on the House Committee of Foreign Affairs, House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism and the House Judiciary Committee. Bass was previously Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
If elected, Bass would become the first woman and second Black Mayor of L.A.

Ever felt like you needed a succinct breakdown of all the incredible things happening around USC sports? Look no longer, because you’re reading the first edition of my bi-weekly “Top Ten Things I Loved in USC Sports” (in no particular order). 
There’s a hefty dose of football this week as we get back into the swing of things, with a nice dollop of soccer standouts and basketball news on the side. Let’s roll.
Kedon Slovis’ underrated running
Modern football is all about quarterbacks who can do it all. From Patrick Mahomes to Lamar Jackson, having a player under center who can throw and run is key to a successful team. Junior quarterback Kedon Slovis did just that against Stanford, breaking out the wheels and racking up yards in between throws. Although ultimately overshadowed by the loss, Slovis is a crafty runner who can find the seams in the defense, and he went for 25 yards on five attempts against the Cardinal. Despite a poor performance on Saturday, I’m confident Slovis can become more of a dual-threat quarterback. 
Heating up
After starting the season with back-to-back losses, women’s soccer rebounded with six straight wins creating a combined scoreline of 19-3. The team is playing free-flowing soccer and they look ready for conference play. Keep an eye out for the Trojans as they hope to continue their winning streak later this week against Pac-12 rivals Arizona and Arizona State.
A Star in the Making
Junior midfielder Croix Bethune has led the way over the Trojan’s recent win streak, grabbing a pair of assists to go with five goals scored. Croix capped off a win in Santa Barbara with a pretty chip over two Gaucho defenders to seal the game.
New Beginnings
For the first time sincemid-2015, football kicked off without former head coach Clay Helton at the helm. Helton’s tenure with the team started brightly with a Rose Bowl victory highlighting his second season. Since that initial success, the Trojans have failed to finish higher than No. 12 in the AP poll and have gone 0-2 in bowl games.
The embarrassing upset loss to Stanford was the final straw for a university looking to return to the top of collegefootball. Cornerbacks coach Donte Williams, named the interim head coach, led the Trojans to a win against Washington State in his first game as interim but said he was out-coached during the Trojans’ loss against Oregon State. 
Jaxson Dart
Is it too early to call him the greatest of all time?
Basketball Loads Up
5-star recruit Vince Iwuchukwu committed to USC a couple of Fridays ago, joining the recent tradition of elite Trojan big men. Standing 7’0 tall with a lanky frame and strong defensive instincts, Iwuchukwu will hope to emulate Evan Mobley and Onyeka Ogonkwu’s success on the interior. Personally, I think he’s got the upside to dominate in the middle for years to come.
Back in Business
There’s nothing like collegefootball. The tailgates, chants and marching bands combine to great effect, creating an unparalleled experience across all of athletics. Over this past year, though, we saw what the sport looked like without fans filling the stands. Empty seats can’t quite match the volume and atmosphere of the real thing, and it’s great to be back in the Coliseum cheering on our Trojans.
Trojan Defense’s Dominant Day in Washington
You’d be forgiven for thinking you walked into a recording studio for the new NCAA Football game listening to USC play Washington State on the radio last week. Every play down the stretch ended in calls of “USC ball” or “Sacked!” The Trojan defensive unit snagged two interceptions and logged three sacks in a complete effort that saw the Cougars struggle to produce anything after an initial two-touchdown lead. The entire defensive-line looked revitalized, which didn’t really transfer to Saturday’s game against Oregon State. However, USC faces a Colorado team this Saturday that failed to score a single point against Minnesota a couple of weeks ago.
ICYMI: Persistence
Women’s volleyball faced off against Hawaii earlier this month, suffering a 3-1 defeat Friday. Undeterred, the Trojans came back the next day and flipped the scoreline, bringing a 3-1 victory home to cap off their trip.
The Epic Highs and Lows of Intramural Soccer
Very often, the focus of this column will be the bright lights and brighter stars of Division I athletics. Rarely, I’ll dive under the bleachers of this vaunted school and tackle perhaps the most underreported sports topic of our times: intramural sports. I recently witnessed firsthand the incredible drama of one such game, a tense 1-0 soccer match last Tuesday. The players were fired up, frustrated after the crushing loss. Coach Mac Dilatush  remarked after the game, “The boys are buzzing, but we’re just going to keep taking it day-by-day.”
Yoav Gillath is a freshman writing about his ten favorite things that happen in USC sports. His column, “Yoav’s Top-10,” runs every other Monday.

Following the implementation of new sustainability measures since the start of President Carol Folt’s tenure, USC received its first evaluation from The Sustainability Tracking, Assessing, and Rating System, “a transparent, self-reporting framework for colleges and universities to measure their sustainability performance.”
After the recent implementation of new sustainability boxes located around the USC Village, USC’s divestment from fossil fuels, solar panels, and signs around campus advertising USC Green Week, the University took it upon themselves to complete the STARS assessment. The University received a silver star ranking — the highest rank being a platinum star ranking — which is earned by about a quarter of universities completing the report. Around 1000 universities, including Princeton, Stanford, MIT and the UC system, also use STARS. 
“A silver rating was higher than [USC officials] were initially expecting and reflects the hard work that many members of our community have put in over the last few years,” Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple said in a communitywide email Wednesday. “It also reflects the tireless efforts of our many campus partners who provided the necessary data for our STARS assessment.”
To receive the STARS rating, USC underwent a year-long process that involved data collection to measure the University’s energy and water consumption, vehicle trips, supply chain and other sustainability factors.
The University plans to continue going through the STARS test regularly, according to Dalrymple. The STARS rank is also an important step in achieving USC’s 2028 Sustainability Plan, which “will include aggressive goals focused on climate neutrality, zero waste, single-use plastics reduction, inclusion, engagement, and enhanced sustainability curriculum and research efforts,” wrote Dalrymple. 
Kathleen Verendia, a senior majoring in environmental studies with an emphasis in sustainability, serves as the executive director of the Environmental Student Assembly. Verendia is particularly excited about USC’s plan to include environmental ethics and sustainability into the curriculum of all the University’s schools. Verendia said she also hopes the move toward sustainability will set an example for the importance of sustainability within our generation.
“It’s important to be mindful of the decisions that we’re making, because even if our decisions seem small or minute; it’s really about changing our mindset,” Verendia said. “I think you need to be mindful of your consumption, and what you’re investing your time and your education in.”
Although the University made progress in setting its first sustainability goals since 2015, several areas need improvement for the University to receive a higher STARS rating, such as sustainable building design, construction and sustainable procurement — including a preference for bio-based materials, implementation of carbon neutral products and the support of disadvantaged businesses. 
There are already an array of changes being made to improve sustainability since the STARS report data was collected.
“The LED lights [the University is implementing] are going to help us by reducing our emissions, and then we’ve got water meters that have recently been put in,” Dalrymple said. “We’re also looking at electric vehicles and putting in more electric vehicle charging stations, and then we’re looking at doing more solar [power].” 
As USC works toward achieving its 2028 Sustainability Plan that will be released next year, Dalrymple wrote the rank creates a “starting point,” and the University is “setting much more lofty goals for achieving sustainability across our institution and will continue to work towards new and innovative ways to achieve those goals.” 
Dalrymple credits the student push for sustainability’s huge impact on campus, complimenting the push from environmental organizations and student activists.
“It’s great that the students have been engaged and have been speaking out,” Dalrymple said. “We want to keep them engaged, keep them informed, make sure that they’re teaching the underclassmen and keep that culture of sustainable behavior, as well as education and awareness.” 
Dalrymple is enthusiastic about the University’s growth demonstrated in the STARS report, but sees more to do on the road to achieving its sustainability goals in an assortment of categories where the University did not perform as well, such as academic curriculum, waste minimization, and investment.
“I felt like it was a really good place, to come across with a medium to high silver score on a first try with STARS was pretty impressive, and then also at the same time it leaves room for improvement,” Dalrymple said. 
Correction: A previous version of this article said the highest rank a school can win is gold. The highest rank a school can win is platinum. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

When Mirella Roberts attended a social event she’d heard about through the Involvement Fair, 30 different people asked her the one question she’d been avoiding for weeks: “Where are you from?” 
“I was probably at the event for 10 minutes, and then I just went into the corner and started crying,” said Roberts, a junior majoring in political science. “My friend was there, and [they asked], ‘Are you okay?’ For the first time, I said, ‘No, I’m not okay,’ and then I came back to my apartment and I cried all night.”
Roberts grew up in South Lake Tahoe, California — a town with 22,000 residents, located in the Sierra Nevada mountains. While Roberts started her first classes of the school year, six hours up north, Roberts’s family packed up her childhood home as the Caldor Fire crept closer to their neighborhood.  
The Caldor Fire started over 40 days ago and has burned over 220,000 acres, destroying at least 782 homes, 18 commercial properties and 203 other minor structures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. In addition to Caldor, 11 other major wildfires and two extended attack wildfires — fires that are uncontained —  are currently burning within the state. The largest is the Dixie Fire, which has destroyed 1,329 businesses, homes and structures; consumed over 963,000 acres of land; and spread across five counties since it began more than 70 days ago in Feather River Canyon. 
Rachelle DeSantis, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, has family members throughout Northern California who have been “under threat of evacuation and had to deal with huge amounts of smoke and haze in the air” due to the Caldor and Dixie wildfires. Although none of her loved ones have been hurt, DeSantis said she often worries about her family’s safety during wildfire season, which, in California, takes place from June to September. According to DeSantis, she often checks wildfire maps and air quality index levels on a daily basis, just to make sure her family isn’t in danger.
DeSantis is from a small town in the Bay Area called Los Gatos. While DeSantis lived in the town, she and her friends and family often experienced practice cancellations, school closures and evacuation warnings related to the wildfires. 
“Last year, I had multiple friends that lived more in the Santa Cruz mountains that had to evacuate their homes,” DeSantis said. “They all ended up being okay as well, thank God, but that was definitely really scary.”
Adam Rose, the director of the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Threats and Emergencies, said the economic cost will be significantly lower than that of a hurricane or a tsunami in a major city because most of the damage takes place in the mountains. 
“These [fires are in] rural areas, and in rural areas, you have a lot of low-income people. You also have a lot of people who have summer homes, second homes or they’re retirees, and retirees typically are on fixed incomes and not necessarily wealthy,” Rose said. “So there are some disadvantaged groups that are going to be significantly affected by the wildfires, but as far as the economy’s concerned … impacts on the order of a billion dollars represent something like one half of 1% of GDP. That’s a significant amount, but not anything like the Great Recession.”
Although experts like Rose agree that this year’s wildfire season isn’t likely to have a huge long-term impact on the state economy, many worry about the smoke’s effect on  people’s health. 
Professor of clinical population and public health sciences Edward Avol has lived in Los Angeles his whole life. He said he’s witnessed the air quality in California depreciate over the course of almost half a decade. 
Co-director of the Exposure Factors Core in the Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center, Avol specializes in assessing air pollution’s impacts on human health. Currently, he’s working on a project “to look at the impact of wildfire smoke on children coming to the emergency room at Children’s Hospital [Los Angeles]” — particularly children of color, who he said are often more vulnerable to experiencing pollution-related health problems due to disproportionate environmental challenges. 
As Dixie and Caldor continue to spread across the state, Avol said he’s worried about the pollution the wildfires are creating. 
“When a wildfire burns, there’s a lot that gets put into the air, both in terms of the ash and the unburned residue, but also in terms of materials that are burned,” Avol said. “Solvents, synthetics, materials … will be consumed [by the fire] and put into the air. Then, of course, that creates an opportunity for all kinds of toxic and potentially carcinogenic chemicals being delivered downwind into the plume.”
When Caldor began burning, the smoke in South Lake Tahoe was so severe that it “broke” the air quality index. According to Roberts, during the first few weeks after the fire started, her mother experienced “significant health effects from the smoke,” including headaches, “extreme fatigue” and nausea. 
“My mom got air purifiers, she got new filters for the house, but no matter what [she] did, the smoke still made its way into the house,” Roberts said. “It just smelled like fire and it wasn’t good.” 
Around the same time, Roberts also discovered that one of her best friends from high school lived in their car because of the smoke levels and evacuation orders. Roberts said she let her friend stay at her apartment near USC until she “had a safe place to be.” 
Although the past weeks have been “very difficult” for Roberts, now that the fires are getting closer to containment, she said she feels “lucky to have the support system that [she] did” while things remain uncertain.
“My history professor … she took time out of her lecture to direct message me and make sure that I was okay after the fires,” Roberts said. “Then, she messaged me again [two weeks later], and it really meant a lot that she would reach out to me. In a class of over 100 people, she remembered that I would possibly be affected by the fire.”

While Sufjan Stevens is no stranger to spectacle, “A Beginner’s Mind” is his most cinematic work yet — literally. Created in collaboration with Californian singer/songwriter Angelo De Augustine, who is signed to Stevens’ own Asthmatic Kitty Records, and released on Friday, the 14-track album takes inspiration from 14 different films that Stevens and De Augustine watched together while on retreat in an upstate New York home.
But the album doesn’t feel like a trip to the cinema. Rather, “A Beginner’s Mind” ventures beyond the common fodder of a Letterboxd review, capturing the quiet thoughts in a dark bedroom that succeed a screening.
The duo interprets their source material loosely, trading plot and character references for reflection on deeper themes and emotional dimensions — so much so that a clueless listener may not even realize they are referencing any films at all, although they do have enough lighthearted spirit to name-drop a few times (see: the cheekily titled “(This Is) The Thing,” which riffs on 1982 classic horror flick “The Thing.”)
The catalogue of cited films varies greatly in tone and critical acclaim (a track inspired by 2004 straight-to-DVD sequel “Bring It On Again” transitions into a lament sung from the perspective of the serial killer in “Silence of the Lambs”), but Stevens and De Augustine’s commitment to their signature gentle sound and profound lyricism makes the record feel cohesive. Their light, wispy voices intertwine beautifully and are often entirely indistinguishable from each other.
Opener and lead single “Reach Out” is a wonderful, graceful thesis statement for the album. “Reach out, reach out to all the ones who came before you / ponder what is right / you and I, in defiance,” the pair sings in harmony. It’s an ode to killing one’s own ego and a statement of intention to keep one’s mind open and contemplative. This mission certainly does feel like an act of defiance: in a world dominated by constant stimulation and selfish temptations, Stevens and De Augustine call for stillness and humility.
The album’s greatest strength is its relentlessly poetic lyrics that feel as if they’ve been excavated from the diary of a wise, ancient philosopher. “Can you explain all our divided pain? / What still remains after the rigor mortis?” the duo asks on “You Give Death a Bad Name.” “Am I at rest or resigned in my chaos?” they croon on “Olympus.” And, bluntly and in Stevens’ typical god-fearing fashion, “Lord, why must this life be so cruel?” on album closer “Lacrimae.”
The duo questions a lot throughout the album’s 46-minute run time, but their inquiries are never met with a clear resolution. Stevens and De Augustine don’t give themselves the authority to provide answers, instead inviting listeners to reflect alongside them.
For De Augustine, the sound of “A Beginner’s Mind” is a continuation of the quiet acoustics of his 2019 album “Tomb,” but notably less skeletal. For Stevens, it’s a return to the folk that marked his early career and came to full fruition with 2015’s exquisite “Carrie & Lowell.”
But where “Carrie & Lowell” offered a guttural and excruciatingly personal view into Stevens’ struggle with grief, “A Beginner’s Mind” is more passive, meandering between emotional highs and lows with a lighter, more controlled spirit.
Admittedly, “A Beginner’s Mind” offers few show-stopping or jaw-dropping moments: it’s just not that kind of album. Stevens and De Augustine held their writing sessions the mornings after their in-home movie viewings, and it shows. “A Beginner’s Mind” sounds like a heartfelt early morning conversation between two friends after a low-key movie night and a good night’s sleep.
“Open the light to the darkness / Open your heart, let it all hang out / Open your life to the hardness / Open your mind til it all falls out / Let it all fall out,” the pair sings on delicate highlight “Fictional California.” Stevens and De Augustine celebrate openness and vulnerability, and they encourage their listeners to do the same. To them, the transcendent can be found in the everyday — which can mean something as simple as a freshly-harvested tomato or a good movie.

The first few scenes of the television series “Bling Empire” depict a world of opulence, excess and status.
It’s no surprise given the show — which premiered in early 2021 on Netflix — follows a group of wealthy Asians and Asian Americans living in Los Angeles. It’s a “slice-of-life” vignette for the audience into what it’s like to have luxury at your disposal. 
There’s no question that “Bling Empire,” like many other reality shows in which wealth is the central character, doesn’t really flesh out anything other than a slightly problematic glorification of wealth. Perhaps that glorification leads to larger conversations surrounding the illusions that onscreen “reality” presents. 
Last semester, for my “Contemporary Prose” class on True Crime narratives, I wrote a paper on the Bling Ring, a group of celeb-obsessed teens who burglarized celebrities’ homes back in the 2000s. The crux of my paper looked at how the film “The Bling Ring” represented the truth of the crime in visual terms.
The two narratives of “The Bling Ring” and “Bling Empire” aren’t exactly related, but they do share a few similarities. What’s thematically interesting about “Bling Empire” and “The Bling Ring” isn’t that they both center on the implications of the word “Bling” — although that does say something about an obsession with status symbols. It’s about how they’re both versions of reality. “Bling Empire” is an unscripted reality television series, and “The Bling Ring” is a fictionalized account of a true story. Fiction and truth are at the core of each. 
In many ways, the stars of “Bling Empire” own the things that the teenagers in “The Bling Ring” desperately want: money and “celebrity” status. I thought about “The Bling Ring” because the teenagers in that film chase illusions of another world, just as “Bling Empire” presents that world as reality through the lens of Asians and Asian Americans living it. All of that exists with L.A. as the backdrop.
When it comes to “Bling Empire,” Asian representation exists in an eternal paradox where the very question of “representation” must ask: What narrative does this offer? Amid op-eds decrying the show’s insensitive ignorance of its context and classist celebration of wealth and privilege, the situation has become increasingly complex. Many of the concerns expressed are well-warranted. We need to consider the diversity of the Asian American experience, and not have one monolithic narrative. 
There are moments when the show, unintentionally or not, falls prey to openly “performing” Asian identity in a way that exotifies it for white consumption, like when Christine throws a lavish Chinese New Year party that feels culturally performative. Thus, in genuine conversations about what constitutes authenticity, the “reel” question is whether or not the “reality” the show presents is necessary for a wider Asian American audience. 
I would argue that in spite of all its complications, yes, it is. Perhaps this is simplistic analysis, but I do think that, as a means of escapism, “Bling Empire” serves its purpose. 
“Bling Empire” examines the lives of wealthy Asians and Asian Americans in L.A. The “characters” in this series are a product of their environment. To that effect, the show visualizes all the things that make L.A. what it is in the contemporary cinematic imagination. It renders the consumer culture, the star personas and stereotypical “L.A. lifestyle” with stunning detail. It does all of that with Asians at the forefront, navigating the city on their own terms. 
So, no, “Bling Empire” shouldn’t just be reduced to the Asian version of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,”  (not to mention, there exists a wider problem when Asian American works of art can only be translated through a Western lens). No one has a monopoly over the themes and ideas that surround a glamorized L.A., and the stars of “Bling Empire” are merely articulating those themes as they view and live them. To ask whether or not “Bling Empire” actively dismisses Asians who don’t belong to this subset also risks dehumanizing those who do. 
My motivation behind watching “Bling Empire” is the same behind watching shows like “Cooking with Paris.” It’s about the spectacle. It’s about peeking into another world, and laughing at the performance of it. Why can’t Asian Americans have their own version of “authenticity” and L.A.?
Of course, as a critic, I could list the number of flaws I found in the show. I could talk about the narrative gaps, the themes that demanded more nuance or the need for greater character development. I could speak about all of those at length. 
As an Asian American, though, I just have one thing to say: “Bling Empire” rules.

CBS’ “The Activist” had the key ingredients for a hit reality competition show: a panel of celebrity judges, contestants competing against one another for a prize and the support of a major network. However, while shows such as “America’s Got Talent” and “The Voice” dominate ratings, “The Activist’’ faced swift backlash after its concept was announced. 
CBS billed the show — hosted by Usher, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Julianne Hough — as capable of inspiring “real change.” “The Activist” would’ve featured six activists in areas of health, education and the environment, competing through digital campaigns for a spot at the G20 Summit in Italy. The “winner” would receive the most money for their cause. 
Twitter immediately attacked the show, accusing creators of profiting off activism. I agree. Activism comes from community building and teamwork, which makes a game-show format feel performative and out-of-touch. Moreover, the complexity of the health, education and environment sectors requires careful attention and understanding. Transforming these issues into soundbites for prime time television dangerously oversimplifies them. 
In response to the criticism, CBS announced it would scrap everything filmed, opting for a complete reimagining of the show. Instead of a competition, CBS will air a primetime documentary highlighting the work of the six activists. The judges have also spoken up, expressing regret for getting it “wrong.”
While I’m glad CBS listened to the masses, I can’t believe they greenlit the concept for the show in the first place. Multiple rounds of people heard the pitch and thought to themselves, “Ah, yes, this seems like a good idea.” “The Activist” debacle is merely a microcosm of the problematic ways celebrities and corporations engage with the idea of activism and social causes: The appearance of doing good matters more than actually doing good. 
Usher, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Julianne Hough don’t come to mind when I hear the word “activists.” However, they put their names on the project to boost their brands and profit off the image of social change because it’s “in” right now. 
Corporations are guilty of this, too. After the murder of George Floyd, companies declared “Black Lives Matter” without any actual action to help Black lives. A newsletter published by Public Information in June 2020 found that a number of companies who tried to align themselves with the Black Lives Matter movement donated significant money to legislators who received low grades from the NAACP.  During June, clothing stores hang rainbow tie-dye shirts that read things such as “ally” or “proud,” only to promptly store those items in boxes come July. Outside of selling rainbow merchandise, corporations need to partner with queer and trans creators and advance policies that protect and support queer and trans employees. 
While I don’t agree with this performative kind of activism, I understand the inclination — people expect their favorite celebrities and companies to use their following to advocate for causes. In response, these celebrities and companies feel pressured to speak up about topics they have little knowledge about. 
Whether it’s Kim Kardashian advocating for criminal justice reform or Leonardo DiCaprio explaining climate change’s impact, social media allows famous people to directly engage with issues for millions of people to see. This sort of work is not necessarily a bad thing, as celebrities give nonprofits and movements recognition they might otherwise lack. However, we should still critically analyze how celebrities approach these issues.
The fact that the celebrity hosts of “The Activist” did not realize the problematic nature of the show highlights their complete misunderstanding of activism. Before a celebrity gets involved in a cause, either as a spokesperson or a financial asset, they need to research and learn from knowledgeable activists and experts. Rushing into a cause without understanding its roots and context trivializes the labor done by people who’ve worked in the field for years.  
If Twitter had not intervened, the producers and celebrity hosts behind “The Activist” would’ve pat themselves on the back and cashed their checks, helping themselves without doing anything of actual importance. 
Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick is a prime example of how a celebrity can successfully and productively involve themselves in a social movement. Kaepernick protested the oppression faced by Black and Indigenous people and people of color when he took a knee during the national anthem prior to a game in 2016. He explained that before going public with his feelings, he sought to “understand the situation better.” Kaepernick communicated with activists in organizations such as Black Lives Matter to ensure he was up to date with their objectives and strategies. 
In tandem with activists already working in the space, Kaepernick’s informed activism promoted awareness of issues such as police brutality and racial injustice to nationwide conversation. Unlike “The Activist,” Kaepernick did not try to profit off activism; on the contrary, many believe NFL teams blackballed Kaepernick from the league despite his ability to play.
While celebrities aren’t required to lose their jobs to engage in activism, they should have real stakes in these issues besides using them as marketing tools for their personal brands. Celebrities have the ability to use name recognition for good. They should not be afraid to speak out, but they also must listen, learn and understand the seriousness of their power.

At the beginning of the semester, the week-long involvement fair and the Sept. 17 carnival attracted hundreds of new and returning students. The University also reintroduced in-person, on-campus tailgating, as seen at the Sept. 11 Stanford game. Not to mention the fact that the University held an in-person Convocation for first- and second-year students. 
This came after an Aug. 26 student media briefing, where Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman announced a full-campus shutdown is unlikely and that the University will address coronavirus case surges using a localized response.  
Although some events and club meetings opted to stay online, others warrant in-person space for celebration, such as events for Latinx Heritage Month.
Latinx Heritage Month spans from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, bringing hopes of on-campus events, especially for those celebrating in person at USC for the first time. Organizations such as the Latinx Student Assembly have already begun to celebrate the month with events such as the Latinx Cookout on Sept. 18, where students ate tacos and celebrated the community in Founder’s Park. 
With organizations hosting in-person LHM events, we must call into question why the University hosted its LHM kickoff online.
On Sept. 16, President Carol Folt, along with other guests, hosted a virtual kickoff for LHM, which included speakers such as alumna Paloma Chávez and performances from Grupo Folklórico de USC. Students interacted via Zoom as a part of the kickoff, but an in-person kickoff may have been even more successful, especially for LHM. 
In-person events have a unique ability to build a community, which was often lost during online classes and the isolation of coronavirus. This is especially true for marginalized communities, who often experience imposter syndrome or isolation in predominantly white institutions such as USC, where Latinx community members make up 15% of the population. 
Physically seeing other people who look like you while celebrating a month of heritage cannot be matched in a virtual sphere. The kickoff event would have been a perfect opportunity to reunite returning students and invite new students to celebrate since most first- and second-years have not been on campus for LHM prior to this year. 
Yes, the virtual event may have been successful and an opportunity to invite speakers who would not have been able to attend in-person.
However, with so many other organizations and events happening in-person, such as the Sept. 18 LSA Cookout and the BSA Labor Day Barbecue, an online kickoff loses its appeal and calls into question why such an important event for so many community members was held virtually rather than in-person. Moreover, it comes off as the University prioritizing other organizations for in-person opportunities, such as tailgating, instead of offering Latinx people a communal space through an in-person kickoff event. 
Although the University suggests that they held the event virtually to keep the safety of students in mind, this seems like a weak justification to not fund an in-person event for Latinx folks and instead allocate those funds elsewhere. The University could have offered a hybrid option so that Latinx students could safely congregate while speakers remotely spoke. They could have even followed in the footsteps of BSA and LSA and held an outside event with distanced tables and food.  
With this especially in mind, there should be more opportunities for Latinx students to band together in person for the rest of the month. USC must support the Latinx community as we come back after a grueling year online.
