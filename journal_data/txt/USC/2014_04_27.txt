Hosting the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament for the first time this weekend, the No. 3 USC women’s water polo team had a lot to prove heading into next week’s NCAA Tournament.

USC was coming off its lone home loss in the regular season finale against No. 2 UCLA, and the Women of Troy (24-3, 5-2) looked to regain control of their home at Uytengsu Aquatics Center and capture a second straight MPSF title. Unfortunately for the Cardinal and Gold, this pursuit was shut down early.
Jumping into the pool Friday afternoon, USC faced off against a sixth-seeded Arizona State team that it had dominated throughout the year. USC had outscored the Sun Devils by a total of 25-10 in the previous two regular season victories, but offense was scarce in Friday’s first-round battle.
After getting out to a 3-1 lead by the end of the first quarter, the Women of Troy were held scoreless in the second period and entered intermission trailing, 4-3.
“We had the opportunities; we just didn’t place the shot,” said junior driver Monica Vavic. “We would hit the goalie or hit the bar. If we can’t get the ball in the goal, it’s going to be a difficult game.”
Though the offense was unable to produce much first-half success, the USC defense remained strong, anchored by senior goalie Flora Bolonyai. The Hungarian native tallied 12 saves for the day — four in the first half — passing Bernice Orwig as USC’s all-time saves leader.
Following another ASU goal midway through the third quarter, which increased the lead to 5-3, the Women of Troy were finally able to gain momentum and end a 15-minute scoring drought. Vavic launched a bullet towards the cage, which tipped  off the goaltender’s fingertips into the top corner. Sophomore two-meter Jayde Appel quickly followed with a pretty touch shot in transition to level the score at 5-5.
After trading goals to begin the fourth quarter, ASU was able to convert on a 6-on-5 advantage to regain a one-goal lead with just over a minute to play. Calm and composed, the Women of Troy exhibited unselfish ball movement as time winded down until senior co-captain Kaleigh Gilchrist rose and propelled a scorcher to even the score with only two seconds remaining in regulation.
“I felt confident [going into overtime],” Vavic said. “I thought that we would be able to take them up and down the pool. We all look forward to those close games — that’s why we’re all athletes. We love those tight games.”
Entering just the second overtime game of the season, USC once again struggled to find the back of the net. After surrendering a goal off of a deep shot attempt, the Cardinal and Gold surged down the pool and drew a 5-meter penalty shot. Junior two-meter Eike Daube’s attempt ricocheted off the post, ending the first half of the extra period trailing, 9-8.
Daube, the hero of USC’s first overtime victory against UCLA earlier in the season, wasted no time making up for her penalty stroke, providing the lone goal of the extra time to force a sudden-death period.
Following a turnover on a USC offensive position, an ASU attacker leaked out in transition to receive a deep outlet pass. Bolonyai left the cage in a race for the ball that found its way past the goaltender, providing ASU with an open-net goal to knock off the Women of Troy, 10-9.
Forced into the consolation bracket with the surprising loss, USC regained its offensive power in Saturday’s contest against seventh-seeded CSU Bakersfield.
In the 22-3 rout of the Roadrunners, nine different Women of Troy tallied goals, led by a career-high six goals from freshman driver Stephania Haralabidis and four from Appel, which also marked a career high.
It took over 20 minutes for Bakersfield to make its presence known on the scoreboard, finally converting on a lob shot over Bolonyai. The saves leader recorded 12 stops in three periods of work before being replaced by sophomore goalie Alegra Hueso.
Earning a spot in the fifth-place game against San Jose State, USC would not let another victory slip through the cracks. The offensive outing displayed against Bakersfield carried over to Sunday’s battle from the beginning. Exploding out of the gates, the Women of Troy posted seven goals in the first quarter, with two apiece  coming from Gilchrist and senior driver Kelly Mendoza.
The second period was no different in regard to offensive dominance. With the help of Appel’s first-half hat trick, capped off by a savvy tipped-in goal from a lob pass by Vavic, the Women of Troy took an 11-5 lead into intermission.
“I think that we were more confident in our shooting and putting the ball in the cage,” Gilchrist said. “Once you put the ball in the cage, it’s pretty simple, you’ll get the goal. That was the difference from the Arizona game.”
USC continued its dominance over the Spartans in the second half, fueled by Vavic’s stellar performance.
Bursting out with a rocket that found the back of the cage just 40 seconds into the half, USC’s No. 7 all-time leader in scoring added on two more to propel the Women of Troy to a 21-9 victory.
With the win, USC claimed a disappointing fifth place in the MPSF Tournament, which was won by No. 1 Stanford.
Still, the team looks at its  experience with some positivity.
“We just need to know what we need to work on,” Gilchrist said. “We have two hard weeks of training and we’ll be ready to go come NCAAs.”
The defending national champions now await the NCAA bracket’s announcement this evening, when they will discover their next opponent. The Women of Troy will play host to the NCAA Tournament in two weeks, featuring the nation’s top 10 teams.

The clock threatened to strike midnight, but USC’s baseball team didn’t want the ball to end. Playing at picturesque Jackie Robinson Memorial Field against crosstown rival UCLA, down four runs in the top of the ninth inning, the prospects were grim, and USC’s potential nine-game winning streak was on the line.
Go ahead · Senior catcher Jake Hernandez singled in the top of the ninth to put the Trojans ahead 5-4 over the Bruins on Saturday. USC would go on to win 7-4 and sweep UCLA for the first time since 2005. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
 
Then the Trojans woke up. With a string of three stealthy singles, the team found itself in an opportune situation and cultivated a comeback by forcing the hand of an overwhelmed Bruin bullpen. Redshirt freshman infielder Reggie Southall, a rising contributor for USC, elicited a bases-loaded walk to plate the first run and tug at the looming deficit.
“It just kind of steamrolled because then they relaxed after they scored a run and then all the kids started feeling it,” said USC head coach Dan Hubbs. “Then you have the bases loaded with nobody out, and that’s when you start thinking, ‘We could win this one.’”
Southall passed his patience at the plate onto his teammates, who flattened their rivals in a thrilling everybody-hits half-inning. Eight Trojan batters faced three different pitchers, lighting them up for them up for seven runs off seven hits and two walks. Blake Lacey, who started the rally with a single, drove home the final two runs of the game for a 7-4 victory.
Hubbs often speaks in clichés. One of his most frequent is that his team, and any team for that matter, can beat any other team at any time in any place. Though it might sound trite, the Trojans have found ways to support his claims, to do the improbable and achieve the highly unlikely.
The come-from-behind win was monumental, the cherry on top of a sweep for the “cardiac kids,” as Hubbs affectionately calls his team.
With Saturday’s victory, the Trojans have accomplished a number of other feats: the first series win against UCLA since 2008, the first sweep of UCLA since 2005, the first three-straight Pac-12 series wins since 2011, more conference wins than last season and their longest winning streak of this season.
USC is sitting on the precipice of much, much more with a 24-17 overall record, and an 11-9 Pac-12 record, which puts them at fifth place in the conference.
Though Hubbs admits that the team “put [itself] probably in the conversation of a post-season berth,” he noted that it’s important that they not get ahead of themselves with so many games left to play.
“We’re a good team. We’re a team that’s fighting to try to make it to regional, so we want to beat the streak, but we’re looking for a win,” Hubbs said. “We think of it as we won one game nine times in a row. We need to focus on winning one more game, rather than thinking about how we’re going to win that tenth in a row.”
The streak owes much of its survival to a pitching staff that has been able to keep an often-scrappy Trojan offense alive with consistent outings. Friday sent some of its best to the mound in sophomores Brent Wheatley, Kyle Twomey and Kyle Davis.
Twomey, who has been delegated to the bullpen, has exceeded expectations in his new role, and recording three strikeouts through 1.2 shut-out innings in the 3-2 victory.
“I think bullpen-wise, once we put in Kyle Twomey, we’ve played better,” Hubbs said. “He’s really stabilized and given us a lot of consistency to be able to use other guys in other games.”
In fact, in the past couple of weeks, Hubbs has had the luxury of having multiple options for any given position. Unlike last year, when the coach would try different lineups to see what he could make stick, Hubbs has seen many different combinations pan out for the better this season.
“I think it’s been huge for their success because when guys start to struggle, we can just plug another guy in and he really picks up the slack,” Hubbs said. “They’ve been working hard with that and everybody knows they’re going to have a chance to be in the lineup at some point to contribute.”
Thursday night’s 10-0 blowout was one of those occasions. Junior pitcher Wyatt Strahan continues to be nearly infallible, hurling eight silent frames for a 20-inning scoreless streak. His dominance was matched by an electric Trojan offense, which notched 10 runs off 13 hits.
“We’re continuing to get that kind of pitching out of our starters and we feel real confident when we go to the pen and if that continues, then we’ll be in good shape,” Hubbs said.
USC looks to win its tenth straight game on Tuesday, when it takes on UC Irvine at Dedeaux Field at 6 p.m.
Hubbs concluded with something else he’s been saying all season, and at this bright spot in USC’s season, it happens to ring true: “We just need to continue to try to play well, and if we do, I’ve been saying this all year, we’ll be in a position to win.”

On Friday, the USC Shoah Foundation commemorated its 20th anniversary with an event featuring trustee Steven Spielberg and USC President C. L. Max Nikias.
Building upon its current success, the Shoah Foundation  announced its intent to establish the Center for Advanced Genocide Research. The center will be housed within the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences with the purpose of examining the causes of genocide and methods of prevention and intervention.
“We are honored to establish this vital center of scholarship and learning,” Nikias said. “The University of Southern California is, and will always remain, committed to creating a world freed from genocide. Through the Center for Advanced Genocide Research, we resolve to have a global impact on the real-world problem of genocide.”
Over the past 20 years, the Shoah Foundation has archived nearly 52,000 audiovisual interviews with genocide survivors and witnesses. These testimonies include ones from the Holocaust, the Rwandan Tutsi genocide and as of last Thursday, the Armenian genocide. The new center will give USC the unique privilege of being the only private research institution with this original material.
Steven A. Kay, dean of the Dornsife College, commentated the event and hosted a panel of three of the Shoah Foundation’s key members: Stephen D. Smith, executive director, Wolf Gruner, soon-to-be director of the new center and Beth Meyerowitz, vice provost of Faculty Affairs.
“By combining ongoing research with the vast amounts of information already collected by the USC Shoah Foundation, I believe we will be able to decode the conditions that can lead to genocide,” Kay said.
The members of the panel commented on the significance of the center and the ways in which it will utilize the archive in conjunction with interdisciplinary study. Through the center, experts across different fields will be challenged to explore and decode the roots of genocide.
“We’ve amassed something greater than the sum of its parts,” Smith said. “Each one of those individual stories was creating the opportunity to dig very deeply into the granularity of genocide. By building on the robust genocide research opportunities already in place at USC, we will be in a position to have a real impact in the field.”
The Center of Advanced Genocide Research will facilitate and continue the impressive research of the USC Shoah Foundation.
“The world now has a beacon of hope in breaking the cycle that leads to mass violence,” Spielberg said. “The USC Shoah Foundation Center for Advanced Genocide Research, where steps incremental and monumental will be made in this march to make ‘Never Again’ a reality.”

USC Kicks For Kids held its season finale at McCarthy Quad on Sunday to conclude its spring soccer season.

Kicks For Kids is a service organization that promotes an active lifestyle among children with physical and developmental disabilities.
The season finale of Kicks for Kids brought out hundreds of kids and volunteers. Representatives from the LA Galaxy professional soccer team also came to volunteer and play with  participants. Maria Soto said her son Alex Soto is a big fan of the team and was excited by the chance to meet the players.
“He really enjoys soccer and this, for him, is like heaven,” she said. “He wants to wear the Galaxy T-shirt he has every single day.”
Soto’s son has been attending Kicks For Kids for nearly a year and looks forward to getting the chance to play soccer every weekend. She says the program has been a great outlet for Alex and wants to see the program continue to grow in the future.
“I hope they can keep up with the program,” Soto said. “Not only for my son, but other kids as well. They see my son doing it, and they want to come too. It’s good because they’re kids who haven’t been able to play soccer before.”
USC senior Zade Shakir, founder and president of Kicks for Kids, found the inspiration to start Kicks For Kids when he was volunteering at Spirits in Action last year. While volunteering, he met an autistic boy named Eric who wasn’t able to participate in mainstream athletic programs because of his disability. Shakir set out to create a program that would give all children the same opportunities.
“As much as these kids love to play soccer, they don’t really have a place to play,” Shakir said. “That really bothered me. As a kid, I was an avid soccer player, and it was a big part of my life. It was where I made all of my friends and had all of my fun as a child.”
Aside from providing special needs kids with a place to play sports, Shakir also wanted to provide a healthy lifestyle. Kicks For Kids provides healthy snacks and encourages its participants to be more active in their daily lives.
“I wanted to provide a place where kids like Eric could come and play without fear of being bullied or feeling left out,” Shakir said. “It had to be free for families. The hope is that the program can inspire a movement away from the current trend where 38 percent of children with a physical or developmental disability are obese or overweight.”
Shakir says the response to Kicks For Kids from the participants’ families has been overwhelmingly positive. Because of the great feedback, Kicks For Kids has continued to grow. The program is currently in the process of becoming a national nonprofit, and Shakir plans to expand the program to other universities across the country, such as Stanford University.
“The chief interest in mind is helping those in the margins or those who don’t have the same access I had growing up,” Shakir said. “That’s a big reason why I’m doing Kicks For Kids … I really want to be a part of trying to be that change reversing that trend.”

Students gathered at the Caruso Catholic Center on Saturday for the second annual TEDxTrousdale event, an independently organized, student-run conference dedicated to providing students with the opportunity to collaborate and exchange ideas.
‘How to experiment’ · Raghav Bashyal, a senior majoring in interactive entertainment, was one of the seven TedxTrousdale student speakers. The event took place on Saturday. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to spreading ideas that range from science to business. The series of talks are events run independently in communities on a local scale. This year, the conference was held by the Academic Culture Assembly division of Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board.
Jasmine McAllister and Erin Limlingan, the co-executive directors of the Academic Culture Assembly, were responsible for organizing the event along with a team of eight others.
“If there’s anything I want to emphasize, it’s that this event is completely student-organized and student-funded,” McAllister said.
The seven speakers for the conference were all USC students who were chosen from over 30 applicants by conference organizers in a blind application process. TED restricts the number of attendees for its affiliated events, so approximately 100 attendees also had to be selected by an application process to attend the event, McAllister said.
The speakers at the event included six undergraduate students and one graduate student. They included Zade Shakir, a senior majoring in international relations and biological sciences; Dru Erridge, a senior majoring in computer science (game design); Catherine Uong, a senior majoring in East Asian languages and cultures and business administration; Raghav Bashyal, a senior majoring in interactive entertainment; Eugene Lee, a senior majoring in architecture and Paulina Shahery, a senior majoring in architecture.
The theme of the conference was “Breaking New Ground,” and attendees were given notepads and encouraged to write and share their ideas during breaks.
Shakir was the first speaker of the day with his talk, titled, “Lessons from a Four-Year-Old Superhero.” He discussed his experience at Spirits in Action, a nonprofit organization that hosts USC’s version of the Special Olympics for developmentally-disabled youth, and how it inspired him to start Kicks for Kids, an organization that provides a healthy and active lifestyle for children with special needs who are often excluded from regular involvement in organized sports.
“Regardless of the future that I pursue, it’s going to be helping those that don’t have the access I was privileged to have,” he said.
The event progressed with a talk by Erridge, who spoke of the importance of innovation even in the face of difficulties.
“It seems to me whenever people look at hardships, all they think about is what they can do when they get out of them,” Erridge said. “But if I look at the people I admire in the world — the technology innovators like Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak or Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg — they made their impact right where they were at.”
Bashyal emphasized the importance of challenging the mind in his talk, “How to Experiment: A Millennial’s Guide.”
“Think about when you’re in class, and you’re bored. There’s no Facebook or your phone to distract you, and the professor sure as hell isn’t going to distract you,” he said. “So what do you do? You start to daydream, your mind starts to entertain you. Daydreams are great places for ideas to grow.”
The event also included a surprise appearance by Ron Finley, a speaker at an official TED conference last year. He is a local, self-titled “gangster gardener” who advocates that people grow their own food as a form of defiance and for nutritional reasons in South Los Angeles, an area dominated by fast-food chains.
He gave an example of his ideal neighborhood garden.
“Now I know that I can send my son to your garden and get some onions, and you can send your daughter to mine and get some apples off the tree,” he said.
Shahery discussed the importance of being aware when going from destination to destination. She explained how she challenged herself to avoid using her cellphone when walking from place to place and how that related to the concept of deliberate irregularities.
“The paths in a Japanese tea garden have regular irregularities,” Shahery said. “Each rock is tilted so that we deliberately place our heels, then our toes, on the rock, step-by-step. This means that our attention comes back to the physical placement of our foot rather than letting our minds wander.”
Those in attendance appreciated the collaborative nature of the event.
Aseem Afsah, a freshman in the World Bachelors in Business program, said that he appreciated hearing the ideas of those more experienced.
“I feel like being a freshman, you don’t really get exposure to a lot of upperclassmen, besides through extracurriculars,” Afsah said. “So I think being able to see people who are about to graduate soon and see their ideas has been pretty cool so far.”
Rona Sheen, a freshman majoring in business administration, also appreciated the topics of the talks.
“I really liked how the first two were about how to get your ideas and ‘don’t be afraid of failure,’” Sheen said. “I liked the fourth talk Eugene Lee gave about the digital printing because I just felt his story was really personal, and it was very introspective into how he actually failed and went through that process — I really liked that.”
Who was the seventh speaker?

It’s an interesting time for streaming media, both in the level of competitiveness and the possible legal trauma associated with it. With the competition becoming more serious, companies are trying to get exclusive content to entice the masses. The biggest acquisition of late was Amazon obtaining the rights to classic HBO shows, the first time any of the premium cable network’s shows have been available to those who do not have an HBO subscription.
Yet with this battle between Amazon and Netflix heating up, so are two separate cases that have recently been presented in court: the legality of Aereo, a service that allows a user to stream shows from public channels, and the impending merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, which could have serious ramifications in the way we access our content.
Amazon’s deal with HBO is a huge deal. Though it won’t have current juggernauts such as Game of Thrones or new series such as Silicon Valley and True Detective, an Amazon Prime subscription will now allow you to access full seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Deadwood, Sex and the City and The Sopranos and will add newer episodes of series such as Girls and Veep three years after their original airdates.
It’s not the standalone HBO Go service that just about everyone on the planet would appreciate, but this is still a huge win for the service, which has bolstered its content with exclusive deals with networks such as FX (Justified and Sons of Anarchy), PBS (Downton Abbey) and Nickelodeon. It’s also seen as a big blow to Netflix, which has admitted to trying to emulate HBO as far as new content is concerned. Despite a recent price hike, Amazon Prime, in the same monthly price range as Netflix, gets you all of this content and two-day shipping for other Amazon products.
Netflix shouldn’t be shaking in its boots quite yet, even if the timing of this announcement is unfortunate. In a first quarter letter to shareholders sent earlier this week, CEO Reed Hastings stated that they might have to raise the price of subscriptions, but only for new users. The streaming service still has a wealth of content, and its original content, such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, is above and beyond anything Amazon Studios has produced. But every time they lose a series and every time another service gains a series becomes more pronouced.
As Netflix and Amazon compete for consumers, however, a larger set of battles lingers in the courts. Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case of television networks against Aereo, a streaming service that allows users to access local broadcast stations and record them using a cloud DVR.
Even though it’s accessing channels that are already free over the air, the networks are arguing that what Aereo is doing is illegal since it is committing retransmission, the redistribution of content. This is the legal reason why anyone who publicly projects a public channel has to pay fees. All of the major networks are furious, with CBS even threatening to pull its network off the air and move exclusively to cable (and considering it’s the No. 1 network on television, that shouldn’t be taken lightly).
This might all end up being irrelevant. The FCC’s proposed rules on net neutrality reportedly won’t stop major broadband providers from offering better services, but only for content providers willing to pay the price. This would completely undermine net neutrality and would only benefit the cable providers, in particular Comcast and Time Warner Cable.
Netflix itself has gone on the offensive against Comcast and the like, saying that creating a tier-based service hurts companies and consumers who couldn’t afford it. Netflix, however, has already prepared itself by signing a broadband distribution deal with Comcast. Curiously, the moment they signed the deal, the notoriously slow speeds that the service had on Comcast networks became much faster. Take that as you will.
The argument over net neutrality and Aereo is indicative of a bigger issue and confirms the obvious: Streaming content is the future of media. It is going to be the primary way any of us will access television and movies. The best that can be hoped for is that the content providers, who also control the broadband for streaming media, don’t jeopardize the innovation that can occur in this field or limit consumers’ access to premium content.

Grizfolk, a name that aptly describes the grizzly looking, folk-fusion band, graced the Carson sound stage on Friday as guest speakers for the USC Thornton School of Music’s Popular Music Forum. The Los Angeles-based band has been on a steady ascent, circulating the music blogs and being heralded by KCRW as an “Artist You Should Know.”
As a band freshly rising through the ranks and through a fortuitous connection with Universal Music Group, Grizfolk was tapped to perform and speak at the forum, a series that takes place every Friday and invites artists, producers, top record executives and other people in the industry to share their experiences with the class of prospective musicians.
“The idea is for us to go to the source, to really find out what the musicians think, what the industry people think,” said Chris Sampson, associate dean of Popular Music & Music Industry Studies at Thornton. “It’s one thing for me to say it, but it’s another thing for them to hear it right from the source.”
With looks of doubt and humbled amusement, the five band members discussed the business with Virgin Records’ Director of A&R Evan Peters, who signed Grizfolk after watching the band develop over the three years that the members have been together.
Grizfolk frontman Adam Roth and guitarist Frederik Eriksson began as a songwriting team for other artists when they met Sebastian Fritze, who plays synth and keys. The trio pulled in their friends Brendan Willing James and Bill Delia to round out their fledgling band.
The band members come from various backgrounds. Two of the five hail from Sweden, where the music scene is brimming with electro-pop. Roth, on the other hand, is a Floridian whose roots are distinctly American. Their music reflects the unlikely unity of the band members, being termed by the band as an electro-inflected folk-rock sound.
“It came pretty natural to mix those genres,” Fritze told his audience. “We’re not thinking about how it’s going to sound; it’s just whatever comes natural. From the melodies and hooks, we’re just picking out what sound we want.”
Sampson, who moderated the panel, opened up the discussion to questions from the students, who asked the band how they made their passion into a career and for advice to help guide them from graduation into the real world.
“I remember, when I was 14, sending out probably 500 demos that all sounded like crap,” Roth said. “Now looking back, I guess the one thing I would’ve done differently is to have just focused on music and perfected songs. I think people are attracted to that, discovering something on their own.”
Peters agreed, adding that because he’s overwhelmed with work for other projects, he doesn’t listen to the demos.
“I think if you’re making music with the intention of being discovered, I think you’re making it for the wrong reasons,” Peters said.
The members also discussed their motivations, what inspires them and how they were given a new perspective on performance when they toured in Europe with indie electro-pop band Bastille.
“Those guys are unbelievable,” Eriksson told the students. “It’s like every day is their last day. They play every show like it’s their last show. We think about that every day now. Don’t take anything for granted.”
Though their words to the Thornton students were encouraging and confident, in a post-panel interview with the Daily Trojan, Grizfolk shared what it was like to speak to students from the other side of success, especially after all the obstacles they have overcome.
“There were a lot of times where I personally thought, I’m not going to do this anymore. I need to find something else. I need some kind of security in my life,” Fritze said.
Fritze joked about piloting and Roth said he seriously considered starting a pedicab business. But each of the members always returned to music — there was never anything else.
“It’s like catching a cold, getting sick,” James said. “You’ll quit and then a couple of days go back, and you’re right back on it.”
But by no means is Grizfolk willing to state that the band, is at the peak of its career.
“We’re definitely not experts,” Roth told the Daily Trojan. Fritze even noted that a year ago, many of the band’s members would be sitting in a similar position. They hoped that they left the students with encouragement as they head off to face a tough path in a tough industry.
“I definitely think I saw myself in these kids, and it was kind of scary,” Roth said. “I know what I had to go through, and it was it was the most grueling thing ever to go through, and it took forever. Hopefully they’ll walk away and think, ‘He’s right. Maybe we should just worry about the songs,’ because that’s what I would’ve done.”

In light of the impassioned protests and sit-ins here on campus these last few weeks, I feel it is my duty to articulate an alternative viewpoint to the one that most of this paper’s coverage has featured.
The Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, as I understand it, wants USC to cancel its contract with JanSport. JanSport is owned by the VF Corporation, a global clothing conglomerate. The VF Corporation owns factories and sweatshops in Bangladesh, a country with low worker protection standards, and every month brings news of new fatalities in factory fires and other accidents. Hundreds if not thousands have died, and USC apparel is stained with the blood of the Bangladeshi poor. SCALE believes it is wrong for USC to be a part of this brutal system and, therefore, is encouraging its divestment from JanSport. This is why they have been especially active in recent weeks, staging rallies, marches and sit-ins and making it onto the local news. They want to generate enough passion among students to coerce President C. L. Max Nikias into meeting with them and, from there, to negotiate an end to USC’s business with JanSport.
Assuming I have interpreted them correctly, I have several critiques of the protestors. The first is what I like to call “The Kony Effect.” Well-to-do and idealistic first-world kids hear of dramatic injustice somewhere in the third world and see it as their duty to resolve it. In this age of social media and democratic ideology, they reason that Mahatma Gandhi’s immortal quip, “Be the change you wish to see in the world,” applies to them, and they wed empowerment with justice. They see a corrupt system infected by greed and hatred, and desire to build a better world through virtuous activism. Though I think they would be loath to admit it, this is a classically American view of the world.
And it is a view of the world that discounts most of reality. Brutal as conditions in Bangladesh might be, the factories at least provide the urban poor of the Ganges Delta with bread for their tables. The alternative — jobless poverty — can be witnessed en masse throughout Bangladesh and its neighbors. And the status quo is not a system that necessarily must continue indefinitely — every nation on Earth which has successfully industrialized, from the states of Western Europe to the Soviet Union to China to Japan to our own United States of America — went through a period of low labor protection standards and frequent deaths. That is simply an unfortunate part of capitalist and state capitalist development. But as those nations grew (or in China and Russia’s case, grow), the combination of improved industrial technology and empowered civil society dramatically reduced factory deaths far more efficiently than any 21st-century Non-Governmental Organization could ever hope to do.
I, too, am appalled by the dismal statistics coming out of South Asia. But it seems to me that having USC divest from the VF Corporation would be an entirely symbolic gesture — no doubt some other university would immediately fill our place. And even if such action forced the VF Corporation to cease its work in Bangladesh and move to more socially just countries, you can bet that other companies would move to fill its place.
Moreover, if factory deaths are a reason to divest ourselves into cleanliness, what else is drenched in the gore of the innocent? Must we give up, too, our laptops and smart phones, which contain minerals that are brutally fought over in Africa? Should we cease to travel anywhere because the gasoline in our tanks comes from oppressive regimes? How much food do we have to stop buying because the people picking it aren’t paid enough?
Injustice is a natural part of human life, a part that so completely bathes all reality that it is impossible to fight it without partaking in it and revealing one’s own hypocrisy. Great change tends to be caused either by great injustice, or terribly slow evolution. The activist will never find satisfaction, for he or she desires a quick and just solution to a problem too complex to have one. Though they might be noble, their worldview does not fit the reality of this world.
This is not to suggest that we ought to simply accept the world’s imperfection and stay silent in the face of evil. To do so would go against our very nature, as the moral law is written on our hearts. It is to say, however, that the wise and just must acknowledge that there will never be anything like true justice, yet strive forever towards the best possible ends, with the most practical possible means. Justice is worth nothing less.
The Occupy Bovard protestors, with their immensely diverse array of interests, do make one very legitimate point — our administration pays little heed to student voices. Ignoring constituent concerns is never good policy.
As the director of the Political Student Assembly, the primary advocacy group for student political action in Undergraduate Student Government, I fully support the protestors in their action and would like to see many more protests and rallies on campus. We should not be hearing about social justice issues from annoying NGO volunteers — we should be hearing them from our own peers and colleagues. Were the administration to open itself to legitimate dialogue with its student population, the stage would be set for positive student political involvement and a greater legitimacy among the student body for the administration. Here’s to hoping.

Editor’s note: This post has been updated. 
I feel that the relevance is that you portray this activism as a kind of white savior complex, that these students are working because of a feeling of ‘duty’ to help those worse off. This kind of ‘charity’ is unrelated to the work SCALE has done because it is done at the request of workers in Bangladesh who are organizing on their own and have asked that college students do this type of work. Hence, ‘solidarity.’
Also, SCALE is a member of the PSA. As you are the director of PSA, I’m frankly shocked that you have not spoken with any of those involved after an entire school year.  It seems like basic respect for those involved in the activism to talk with them before writing a public piece discrediting their campaign.

This past weekend, I had the unique privilege of serving as a panelist at the Young Women’s Political & Civic Leadership Program, hosted by USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
Over the course of the hour, I shared what motivated me to run for office at our university with a room full of bright-eyed young women. I shared anecdotes of my immigrant roots and my small-town beginnings. I spoke about what it’s like to make mistakes and to be criticized for your work. I laughed while recounting the first time I ran for a position — it was in the 4th grade and my slogan (unfortunately) was “Vote for Rini because she’s not a meanie.”
As the conference wrapped up, numerous young women walked up to me to shake my hand. Many asked for my business card, some even asked to take pictures with me. In a room where former mayoral candidates and important public officials stood around, I couldn’t help but wonder: Why me?
After all, I’m only 19 years old — I feel like switching my major as much as I switch shampoo brands; there are days where my breakfast food choices confuse me and there are too many times in the year when I feel like I have no idea what I’m doing in life.
But to them, I’m Rini Sampath, USC’s Student Body Vice President. These girls told me that they also wanted to run for office in college.
After this weekend’s events, I’ve learned that regardless of where an individual goes in life, regardless of how successful he or she is financially, it is his or her societal duty to cultivate the next generation of leaders.
Empowering the next generation of female leaders should be the ultimate priority in women’s empowerment. Young girls have so much excitement and optimism, and with guidance, this energy can be channeled into true greatness. Implementing more mentorship programs to foster more confident and ambitious young women is instrumental to the vitality of our future; it is imperative that we provide them with the resources and motivation to achieve their dreams.
But this isn’t just cheesy rhetoric; this idea is supported by real research. A 2011 study by the University of Georgia revealed the importance of mentor and mentee relationships in overcoming hardship. According to a press release, researchers discovered “that behaviors such as anger, breaking the law, and substance abuse were reduced when informal mentors provided support and helped them learn to deal with adult problems.”
Philanthropist Marjorie Harvey, co-founder of the Girls Who Run the World weekend program, has made it her goal to empower young women.
“In my eyes, we’ve really failed this generation, and it’s time to step up and do damage control to help these children be able to navigate through the pressures and mistakes they make … I tell the girls, ‘Y’all are the prize. Please stop giving your power away. Set the bar high,’” she told Essence magazine.
As Harvey noted, young girls need to be instilled with the confidence to succeed. Though high school student governments are filled with women in executive roles, distractions turn women away from those same positions at the collegiate and professional levels.
Fortunately, mentorship programs such as Women and Youth Supporting Each Other hone in on this problem and work tirelessly to solve it. WYSE is a national nonprofit mentorship program, and the USC chapter dedicates multiple hours each week to educating young girls at local middle schools.
These types of efforts are critical to our future.
Looking back on yesterday, I know in my heart any one of those girls could go on to become our next mayor, the next Facebook COO, the next U.S. attorney general or secretary of state. They have unparalleled potential.
As Plutarch once said, “The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.”
So even if we’re not superheroes or celebrities, even if we don’t have some parts of our own life figured out, we must recognize that a few words of encouragement or a few hours every weekend can go a long way.
