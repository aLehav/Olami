Warren Poh | Daily TrojanBest of the best · Goalie McQuin Baron will enter his senior year as the reigning top player in college water polo after his stalwart 2016 campaign.
Goalie McQuin Baron won the Peter J. Cutino Award on June 4, becoming the fifth Trojan in program history to win college water polo’s highest honor. Baron was a stalwart in cage throughout the men’s water polo team’s 2016 run to the NCAA title game, tallying 247 saves on the season and finishing the year second all-time on USC’s career saves list.
Baron thanked his friends, coaches and family as he accepted the award. He also remembered former high school teammate and standout Trojan 2-meter Jon Walters, who passed away in 2014.
“I accept this award with a huge hole in my heart, knowing that Jon Walters would have been here receiving this honor instead of me,” Baron said.
The Cutino Award caps a strong year of water polo for Baron. The goalie entered his junior season in 2016 after representing Team USA at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and he anchored the Trojans in net upon his return from Brazil, as the team advanced to its 12th consecutive NCAA final.
Baron averaged 11.62 saves per game versus only 4.47 goals-against per game, including a career-high 19 saves against Cal in the title match. Baron’s performances earned him MPSF Tournament MVP honors as well as a spot on the All-MPSF First Team and NCAA All-Tournament Second Team.
As Baron gears up for his final season in cardinal and gold, he sits just 38 saves shy of matching Joel Dennerley’s all-time program record. Dennerley was also a Cutino Award winner (2011), alongside Kostas Genidounias (2014), J.W. Krumpholtz (2008 and 2009) and Juraj Zatovic (2005). All winners — and the Trojans’ nine finalists — have played under current head coach Jovan Vavic, who was named Pac-12 Coach of the Century in 2015.
One day after Baron received his award, five players from the record-setting women’s water polo team earned All-American selections. Senior driver Stephania Haralabidis headlined the pack, as she was named to the All-American First Team for the second consecutive year. After leading the MPSF in scoring last season. Haralabidis finished her Trojan career with 269 goals — second-most in program history.
While Haralabidis became just the eighth Trojan to graduate as a four-time All-American, freshman utility Maud Megens started along the senior’s path, earning a spot on the second team in her debut collegiate campaign. Megens led USC in goals last season and was named to the NCAA All-Tournament Team in addition to a host of conference honors. Her 58 scores were the third-most ever by a Trojan true freshman.
 Senior 2-meter Brigitta Games and sophomore goalie Amanda Longan were named to the All-American Third Team. Longan secured her second straight All-American selection after earning a spot on the first team following last season’s championship run. She saved 221 shots and averaged 10.91 saves per game. Games wrapped up her three-year career at USC with a strong final campaign during which she netted 57 goals. Games was also a Cutino Award finalist in 2016.
 Finally, junior driver and
second-year captain Brianna Daboub rounded out this year’s group of All-American Trojans. Daboub chipped in 20 goals, including a key hat trick in the NCAA semifinal match against Michigan, en route to her second straight
All-American Honorable Mention.
 The women’s water polo team now looks forward to the 2018 season after setting a national-record 52-game win streak in 2017, only to lose the streak and berths to both the MPSF and NCAA championship games to Pac-12 rival Stanford. The men’s team, on the other hand, gets set to kick off a new year in September, as the Trojans look to avenge their loss to Cal in the 2016 title game.

The women’s tennis team found itself in an unfamiliar position this summer when former head coach Richard Gallien departed at the end of last season to bring an end to his 22-year tenure at USC.
The uncertainty didn’t last too long, however, as Athletic Director Lynn Swann announced the hiring of eight-time NCAA Division III champion Alison Swain as the new women’s tennis head coach on June 7.
“We are delighted and excited to welcome Alison Swain to the Trojan Family,” Swann said.  “She is a proven winner as a head coach. Winning a national championship at any level is difficult to do; winning eight of them like Alison has done in a
10-year span is beyond impressive. We are confident that she can bring the Women of Troy to that championship level.” 
Swain’s .889 winning percentage (224-28) during her tenure at Williams College headlines her career track record, as well as her 48-2 mark in NCAA tournament play. She set a Division III record by leading the Ephs to eight NCAA team championships — including wins in each of her first six seasons, which tied Stanford for the most consecutive championships at any level.
During her other two seasons with the Ephs, Swain led Williams to five conference championships along with a second-place finish in the 2016 NCAA tournament and third place in 2014. 
“I would first like to thank Lynn Swann, [assistant athletic director] Scott Jacobson and the entire search committee for the incredible opportunity to join the USC family,” Swain said. “USC has an exceptional athletics tradition, but more importantly the University truly values creating an overall amazing experience for its student-athletes in the classroom, on the court and beyond.”
Swain was awarded the conference Coach of the Year five times and was named top coach in the NESCAC twice between 2010 and 2013. During her time at Williams, she produced two NCAA-champion doubles teams in 2015 and 2016, two NCAA singles runners-up, 18 All-Americans, two ITA National Senior Players of the Year and an ITA National Most Improved Senior of the Year.
It was a challenge to replace a decades-long presence in the program, but Timothy Russell, CEO of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, praised Swain’s arrival.
“USC has made a triple crown appointment,” Russell said. “With Alison Swain, the Trojans have a great coach with a championship pedigree, a fabulous teacher with a proven commitment to the highest levels of academic achievement and a splendid mentor of extraordinary character.”
Swain was only the second person in NCAA history — in any division — to win an NCAA tennis team championship as a player and a coach. During her playing career at Williams, Swain co-captained the Ephs to the 2001 NCAA championship: the first in the school’s history. She claimed All-NESCAC honors and was named a Scholar-Athlete
All-American.
Swain now tries her hand at the Division I level, where she will take over a Trojan team coming off an up-and-down season. USC endured a four-match losing streak in March only to rebound by winning seven of its final nine regular-season fixtures and making a run to the Pac-12 semifinals. Swain will look to improve on the Trojans’ first-round exit to Denver in last season’s NCAA tournament.
“She has a vision and a plan for our program,” Swann said. “She is an educator and a developer of tennis players, of scholar-athletes and of women. She will create a supportive and healthy culture for our program that will lead to success in the classroom, in life and on the tennis court.”

Katie Chin | Daily TrojanTrojan spirit · Freshman Kayla Richardson and the USC track team finished their season last weekend at the NCAA Championships. The men’s team came in 20th at the end of the four-day meet in Eugene, Ore., and the women’s squad boosted itself to third place with a strong final day.
The USC track team finished its NCAA Championships on Saturday, as the six-month season culminated in last week’s meet against the nation’s elite programs at Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore. The men’s squad finished 20th overall and second among Pac-12 schools — behind only ninth-place host Oregon. The Trojans clinched a third overall finish on the women’s side, sliding in behind the champion Ducks and runner-up Georgia.
The men kicked off the NCAA Championships on Wednesday, and USC scored six points to end the first day of the meet tied for 14th in a field of 78 teams. Redshirt juniors Eric Sloan and Nick Ponzio finished sixth in the long jump and shot put, respectively. Freshman Michael Norman punched a ticket to the 400m dash finals alongside redshirt sophomore Marquís Morris, who qualified for Friday’s 110m hurdles finals.
USC’s women began their quest for a national title on Thursday, and the Trojans matched their male counterparts identically on the scoreboard, ending the day in 14th place with six points. Unlike the previous day, however, USC scored thanks to one third-place finish from redshirt senior Brittany Mann, and eight Trojans also advanced to Saturday’s event finals.
Norman and Morris returned to action on Friday, as they looked to score points in the men’s event finals. Norman took home fourth in the 400m dash with a personal-best time of 44.88 seconds. The performance earned USC five points and also marked the fifth-fastest time ever run by a Trojan in the 400m final. Norman also improved on his program freshman record and earned a seventh-place standing on USC’s all-time list.
Morris scored three points after finishing sixth in the 110m hurdles finals, becoming the first USC runner to score in the event since 2014. The Trojans finished the NCAA Championships with a total of 14 points, which tied them with Penn State for 20th overall.
Finally, USC ended the weekend with a bang on Saturday, as the women’s event finals lifted the team to a third-place finish. The Trojans’ 43 points overall were the program’s most since a 57-point showing more than a decade ago (2002).
Freshman Anna Cockrell and senior Amalie Iuel headlined USC’s final day at Hayward Field, as the pair clinched a 2-3 finish in the 400m hurdles to score 14 key points. Cockrell clocked a season-best time of 55.36 seconds, moving up to third on the program’s all-time list. Cockrell also scored a point for the Trojans with an eighth-place finish in the 100m hurdles alongside redshirt sophomore Dior Hall, who came in seventh.
Junior Kendall Ellis earned USC’s final top-three finish of the weekend, as she took third in the 400m dash final with a time of 51.06 seconds. Senior Cameron Pettigrew trailed in seventh place (52.52) to combine with Ellis for eight points. Redshirt sophomore Ky Westbrook and junior Deanna Hill rounded out the individual Trojan scoring with eighth and sixth-place finishes in the 100m and 200m dash, respectively.
The championships’ pivotal moment came in the final event, however, as USC’s 4x400m relay team claimed second to boost the Trojans from sixth to third place overall, leapfrogging Florida and Kentucky. Pettigrew, Ieul, Hill and Ellis’ combined time of 3:23.35 beat the previous collegiate record of 3:23.75, but Oregon still finished 0.22 seconds ahead of USC to set the new record and clinch a national title.
 With only eight seniors graduating from a deep roster before the start of next season, the Trojans now set their sights on next spring, when they will look to build on their strong showing in Eugene.
Hope you are correct that Sloan is a red-shirt junior whereas he is listed on the roster as a senior. Failure to score in the
TJ when he had the nation’s best mark before the meet hurt a lot along with Randall Cunningham not making the meet
in the HJ. That could have been a max of 20 pts. to the total doubling the men’s score. Women did well, but again with
18 scholarships there is enough to win a title w/o money problems for walk-on athletes. Like to see a separate head coach
for the Men to improve the program.

Signifying Form, the latest exhibit at The Landing Gallery, is filled with the voices of the underrepresented. With works by Betye Saar, Maren Hassinger, Senga Nengudi, Alison Saar, Dominique Moody, Brenna Youngblood and Samella Lewis, curator Jill Moniz put together a collection that features the narrative sculptural works of black female artists between 1935 and 2016.
The works showcased are as unique as the artists who created them. Each aspect and element of their art speaks and is derived from different concepts, ranging from historical references to social and political commentary.
“I wanted to show the magic of what happens when you signify form,” Moniz said. “The Western canon said that modern sculpture was devoid of narrative, but these women viewed their own narrative into the forms themselves that they created. So, I wanted to show how that worked, despite what the West believes.” 
The many different black female voices, both historical and contemporary, come together to create a moving and powerful exhibit.
Featured artist Dominique Moody was born in Germany to a military family. At the age of 28, Moody became legally blind from genetic muscular degeneration. Afterwards, she shifted her work from two-dimensional illustrations to three-dimensional sculptures. Moody’s piece “Sweat Equity” touches upon the idea of unpaid labor and has elements inspired by African diaspora folklore. It is made from the remnants of found objects such as multicolored glass, twigs and a slew of other materials.
Brenna Youngblood’s wooden sculpture “Untitled” features mathematical symbols and fractions. According to Lisa Henry, the independent curator who wrote the foreword on Brenna Youngblood’s work, Youngblood’s wooden mathematical signs are a reflection of the universal language of mathematics. 
“Brenna gives us abundance and minimalism,” Henry said, “both math and poetry.” 
Contemporary art veteran Betye Saar has three pieces within the exhibit. “Crimson Captive” is a powerful visual of a red Victorian birdcage with a woman inside, draped in heavy chains. The crow symbolizes the oppression that the black community faced under Jim Crow laws. The piece pays homage to Maya Angelou’s autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.
Alison Saar, another artist whose work is featured, conveys the vulnerability, dignity, beauty and humanity of black women through her art. Her sculpture “Cotton Eater (head)” is one of the most powerful pieces within the exhibit. It is of a black woman’s head, tilted on its side, with cotton overflowing in her mouth. The woman, with her eyes appearing gouged out, is silenced into a state of constant oppression.
“Alison likes to make heads as a representation of the woman,” Moniz said. “She consumes and is consumed by cotton. She is pregnant with it although it is not of her.”
Featuring Allison Saar’s work was very important to Moniz, as she is one of many black female artists who have not been recognized in the mainstream art community.
“Black women are at the bottom of the art market,” Moniz said. “[I focused on black women] precisely because they are unrepresented. I wanted to show the arc of 80 years of making work for themselves and for each other and what that looks like.”
Exhibits such as Signifying Form are attempting to promote black female artists’ participation in underground and mainstream art conversations. 
Signifying Form will be on display at the Landing Gallery until July 1.

After opening his first taco shop in 2016, Danny Trejo has staked his claim in the Los Angeles’ food scene. And with the recent success of Trejo’s Tacos, Trejo has also added another chain to his culinary resume: Trejo’s Coffee & Donuts.
The actor turned businessman, best known for his tough-guy roles in Machete and Breaking Bad, is also coming to the USC Village this fall for the opening of his second Trejo’s Tacos.
Located on the corner of a strip mall on Santa Monica Boulevard and Highland Avenue, Trejo’s Coffee & Donuts is hard to miss. Its hot pink exterior and company logo are the center of attention at this intersection. With a line wrapped around the block at 9 a.m., people wait patiently every day hoping to get their favorite sweets before they sell out.
The flavors are not anything you would recognize from a typical doughnut chain like Krispy Kreme or Winchell’s. Trejo’s Coffee & Donuts offers an array of 25 inventive options such as the “Margarita,” made with tequila and lime, or the “Nacho,” made with his original hot sauce, chives, jalapeños and cheddar cheese.
When asking  for a recommendation, the cashier immediately pointed out those two choices and said she loves to cook an egg to put on top of the nacho one. While the cashier and I can agree that this is an unorthodox food pairing, the shop’s willingness to push boundaries is what makes Trejo’s so intriguing. He also has something in store for his die-hard fans. His team conjured up the “Machete,” which is just what you would expect: a machete-shaped donut.
Trejo also pays homage to his Latino roots through his doughnuts. This is evident when reading names such as “Abuelita,” “Piñata Cake,” “Tres Leches” and “O.G.,” among others.
These doughnuts do not disappoint. The confections are fluffy and packed with myriad bold flavors. You can taste high-quality ingredients, and it’s clear when staring through their glass window that their workers do not fall short of making sure every pastry looks just as tasty as the one next to it.
The doughnuts come packaged in a standard pink box, but with the Trejo’s logo plastered on top. Due to the shop’s popularity and constant influx of customers, there is not much time or room to stand around. The shop also does not offer any seating, so be prepared to wait a while before diving into your food. With that said, the shop’s success does not come solely from Trejo’s name.
“There’s been a lot of celebrities that have tried to open up restaurants, but they kind of try to just go on the name,” Trejo said in an interview with KTLA 5. “I don’t care who you are — [the] food better be good.”
Trejo makes it clear he wants his customers to enjoy his products, and hopes to be a force to be reckoned with in Los Angeles’ culinary scene.
There is no question the established actor is on his way to building a multi-million dollar culinary empire. For Trejo, the sky’s the limit — and he’s not stopping anytime soon.

The Lyon Center, which was originally built in the 1980s, has been undergoing renovations this summer and is scheduled to reopen all of its facilities in early August, well before move-in day. 
Michael Munson, the associate director of facilities at the Lyon Center, said that this remodel would reflect many external changes that fitness centers have introduced in the past few decades. 
“The building is 30 years old, and needed some [updates],” Munson  said. “The design in the ’80s was very compartmentalized, and now the style is more open.” 
The construction is progressing rapidly, with demolition almost done and structural framing currently taking place. The lobby area will feature a glass divider from the main gym as opposed to an opaque wall, in order to create the feeling of a more open space. The gym equipment, which will include new strength machines, cardio machines and fitness accessories, is scheduled to arrive during the first week of August, according to Munson.
The squash courts and racquetball courts are also a primary point of focus. Justine Gilman, the senior director of recreational sports facilities, stated that the updates would also incorporate a system in which students will be able to swipe themselves into the center, in order to improve workflow and efficiency. 
In the past, the Lyon Center has faced some pressure from student groups to improve the facilities. A few years ago, a Facebook group called “Revamp Lyon Center” was created and since then, students have been consistently pushing for an upgraded fitness center and gym. 
“I’m really excited,” said Shaina Wottitz, a rising junior majoring in communication. “I work out there a lot, and I think that the place definitely needed some fixing up.” 
Along with the new equipment and updated facilities, the auxiliary gym, which previously existed on the second floor of the building, will no longer be in service. According to Gilman, this space will be utilized as a practice room for the Trojan Marching Band. Gilman stated that this change, along with the introduction of a fitness center at the upcoming USC Village, gave the administration a chance to look at how they can provide other recreational facilities to students. 
The fitness center at the USC Village, which is currently scheduled to open in mid-July, is a 30,000 square-foot project with 100 machines for cardiovascular exercise and 75 machines dedicated to weights. 
“The renovations at the Lyon Center will bring us on somewhat of an equal footing with the brand-new USC Village,” Munson said. 
According to Munson, the administrative team at the Lyon Center is also hoping to expand on the F-45 classes. F-45, a high intensity interval training class with approximately 3,000 different exercises, is popular among students. This remodel will include an extension of the group exercise studio in the hopes that more students will be able to participate in the F-45 classes. 
 In addition, some equipment from the auxiliary gym will be moved to Court A in the basketball gym on the second floor. Munson stated that the administration is willing to get some feedback from students about this change.
“Moving the equipment to Court A is kind of a one-year experiment,” he said. “We want to see if students want that space for equipment and cardio, or whether they want it for multifunctional court, for example.” 
Currently, the Lyon Center has its pool and main gym open to students, but only a few cardio and weight machines. Summer hours are also significantly shorter; during the academic year, the Lyon Center is open for 116 hours a week, compared to 82 hours a week during the summer.
Shradha Jain, a rising junior majoring in business administration who is living at USC this summer, said that she has felt the effects of this sudden adjustment and it has infringed on her normal workout routine.
“The [hours] are so much shorter now, and this can be inconvenient,” Jain said. “I got really used to following a schedule, and not being able to follow it anymore changed my routine.”
Though the hours and equipment are limited this summer, Munson said the Lyon Center staff is trying their best to help students.
“We’ve been trying as much as we can to give some options for people to work out over the summer,” Munson said. “Our other option was to shut everything down.”
While the Lyon Center will close its doors to students between July 15 and early August, the fitness center at the USC Village will be available for use beginning July 17.

In late April, the National Association of Colleges and Employers reported promising job projections for recent college graduates: Employers are expecting a 5 percent increase in college hiring. After graduation, and even during the semesters leading up to it, seniors scramble to apply to as many entry-level positions as possible, especially if they do not plan to pursue graduate school.
Actively applying for jobs and holding a bachelor’s degree are necessary for graduates entering the job market, but reports released by the Wall Street Journal and PayScale suggest that students are not prepared enough for the workforce and are lacking in the basic soft skills, such as writing and critical thinking, that employers seek. Although USC stresses the importance of a well-rounded education and internship experience before graduation, the University should create programs to ensure each student is fully prepared for the workforce in terms of both skills and professional experience. USC should follow universities like Bradley University and Belmont University, which have co-operative education programs (co-ops) that integrate students into a specific career field, allowing them to gain a full-time work experience while acquiring the soft and hard skills that are needed in their industry.
 The Wall Street Journal’s analysis revealed that there were a surprising number of students who lacked critical thinking skills. Katie Bardaro, vice president of data analytics at PayScale, also described a skill gap between working professionals and young college graduates described by hiring managers, which hinders students’ abilities to secure jobs in specific industries. The creation of a co-op program at USC or, similarly, a fostered encouragement for students to take on co-ops, would provide a valuable learning opportunity for students to pursue their future careers early on and discover the ins and outs of the industry in which they would work in. A co-op grants students hands-on work experience, which would reduce the skills gap reported by many hiring managers and upper-management toward college graduates.
 Many companies from a variety of different fields hire interns year-round, but the most competitive season is summer since all students are off from school. A developed co-op program would encourage students to take on an internship in either the fall or the spring when the application pool is less competitive, while also helping students rearrange their course schedule so they won’t fall behind. Currently, USC does not have any resources that would allow for students to pursue a co-operative work experience. Instead, students  are left with the option to take a leave of absence. Although there are classes that allow students to earn academic credits for their internships, there are no programs that encourage an integrated full-time experience that is markedly different from the work of a part-time intern.
 The co-op experience would also help students determine their fit for a certain career path, which will ultimately help in their post-graduation job search and provide them with industry networks and a general direction for their future. The Las Vegas Sun reports that millennials are shifting their focus toward happiness in comparison to money in their job hunt. 
“Sometimes finding what will become your fulfilling career is a process of discovery and elimination,” said John Napolitano, CEO of U.S. Wealth Management, in an interview with Las Vegas Sun. “[But] if you never love what you do, you’ll rarely find financial success.”
 As graduates’ mindsets shift toward discovering a fulfilling career in addition to monetary value, universities should encourage students to dip their toes in working within specific industries of their interest. A co-op experience grants students the perspective of working as a full-time candidate in their desired field, which greatly differs from the work of summer interns, who are often treated differently than employees. Students would be able to discover if their skills sets and personalities, fit with the job. They would gain the opportunity to understand the inner workings of a company’s culture while working alongside real professionals  in a work setting.
Although USC has created an extensive career center, with resources and career portals for each specialized school, the University should strive to do more to prepare its students for full-time employment. Having internship experience and alumni connections are important, but a co-operative education experience is an opportunity not brought to the attention of enough undergraduate students. The job market for the Class of 2017 is projected to improve; however, the future remains uncertain for the years to come. In April, Bloomberg reported that 44 percent of graduates were employed in fields that do not require a college degree in the final semester of 2016. USC must take responsibility and devote its resources to ensure that its students receive proper educational and technical training to prepare them for the workforce and the fluctuating availability of jobs. Regardless of the job market, a co-op program is an experience that would provide students insight into their prospective industry and allow them to proactively plan their desired career path.

Harvard College reportedly rescinded the admissions of at least 10 prospective freshmen, according to The Harvard Crimson, based on sexually explicit and racially charged statements and memes made by students in a private Facebook group. 
In an increasingly digitized world, an individual’s online presence has integrated with their identity and character — which reflects and possibly represents the institutions in which they are affiliated. Universities have generally reserved the right to revoke a student’s admission status for instances such as lying on a college application, failing to uphold academic performance, or for committing a crime or engaging in questionable behavior.
Institutions, however, should also hold the right to revoke admission based on inappropriate, offensive behavior or speech that does not align with their values or mission as a school.
But first, admission officers and university officials should analyze each situation brought to their attention in a case-by-case fashion. This will ensure the university’s ultimate decision does not infringe upon a student’s right to free speech. Offensive speech is a subjective issue. Universities must realize the importance of encouraging intellectual debate and discussion in classrooms and forums without fear of censorship or consequences. 
For example, conservative speakers like Charles Murray and Milo Yiannopoulos have been deemed racists and xenophobes. But their events can provide students a space to critically analyze and debate their perspectives. There is an explicit difference between students debating diverse viewpoints in an intellectual setting and sharing controversial, offensive content online that stands in opposition to the values of the private institution of which admitted students are hoping to belong.
The meme content leaked to Harvard officials was not provocative for neither educational nor intellectual purposes. Instead, these memes -— which attempted to make light of the Holocaust, child abuse and sexual assault — were made with no other objective than to get some cheap laughs at the expense of marginalized groups. Although humor, like offensive speech, is subjective, institutions have to draw the line somewhere, especially when these discretions are occurring in Facebook groups that bear their names.
Although universities cannot always control what students say or post, students must realize that their actions and words can potentially be shared when they post online, without their consent or knowledge.  The shared messages reflect a general cultural and social insensitivity in those who said them, and Harvard was well within its rights to make a powerful statement against that kind of rhetoric.
 Since Harvard officials received these sexually and racially explicit statements through a leak in a private group chat, the line between these rescinded students’ public and private lives have become blurred and, therefore, a point of debate. As a private institution, however, Harvard enjoys the broad authority to admit or revoke a student on the basis of enforcing its standards of  conduct.
 The Constitution’s free speech clause protects deeply offensive, even racially charged, speech if it exists without the implication of imminent violence. Speech, however, that is considered lawful is not always ethically correct, socially acceptable or responsible. It is in universities’ best interests to recruit a student body that will uphold its values. Universities have a reputation to uphold in the public sphere, and since private messaging groups and social media posts are so easily shared, leaked and made public, students should understand and bear the consequences of what they decide to post online. In a Kaplan Test Prep survey of university officials, 35 percent said they viewed student’s social media when making admissions decisions, and 42 percent said that what they saw negatively affected the student’s admissions prospect. Today, an individual’s digital footprint carries heavy weight and is a reflection, or extension, of their identity. The digital sphere holds a plethora of personal and private information that can easily  be made public. Thus, students must be held accountable for what they decide to share about themselves.
 This is not a debate about whether students’ free speech has been infringed upon, but a call to action to students across the country to be more mindful about the content they post, the rhetoric they use and the image of themselves they choose to put forth to the world.
