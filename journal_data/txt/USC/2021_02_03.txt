Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Trinity Moore introduced the Spring 2021 budget, used to fund several USG needs as well as various University-wide programs, during Tuesday’s Senate meeting. The only scheduled new business on the meeting’s agenda, USG’s semester’s budget has a total allocation of $642,610, with a majority being allocated to the Concerts Committee.
USG Chief Financial Officer Zach Taymuree constructed the budget with the assistance of other executive level staff and extensive consultations with organizations considered for budget allocations.
Prior to the budget’s formal introduction, discussion erupted regarding the allocation of funds to various programming committees such as the Concerts Committee. On the proposed budget, the Concerts Committee is slated to receive $175,000, an increase from $95,000 last semester and the largest line item on the budget.
Last fall, the Concerts Committee had a portion of their budget reappropriated due to rising need elsewhere and a smaller USG budget, but maintained a strong demand for the funds, citing expensive production costs despite the pandemic.
However, students such as Alyssa Delarosa, were quick to express discontent at this line item, bringing up the inappropriateness of these allocations in light of a time where students are subjected to tuition increases and financial aid reductions on top of other potential hardships due to the coronavirus.
“We’re in a pandemic. We’re all online right now, so we just don’t understand all the money [going] towards concerts,” said Delarosa, a junior majoring in psychology. “That doesn’t make any sense. We just really want transparency on where that money’s going.”
Samantha Gibbs, Concerts Committee co-director and a senior majoring in communication, said that the committee expects to use “a large sum” of the budget and any unused funds will be returned back to USG. 
“It is always an issue of optics, regardless of the fact that we are currently in a pandemic,” Gibbs said. “Concerts [Committee] gets a lot of money, a lot more than other people … but anyway we can support the other committees and support them in their endeavors, we’re also willing to do so.”
While Concerts Committee’s funding will increase with the new budget, several other organizations will receive no additional funding, including the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, Service Student Assembly, Performing Arts Committee and Speakers Committee. This move comes largely after one-on-one conversations between all programming organizations, several specifying no need for additional funding. 
A new Accessibility Fund was also added to the budget. Taymuree, who created the fund, said he hopes USG uses a portion of the money to aid students in need of DACA renewals, something he claimed workers from the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life have paid for out of their own pockets in the past.
“Accessibility is a very broad term,” said Taymuree, a junior majoring in mathematics and economics. “We purposely made it that way. It’s really how you interpret it; it could be institutional access or it could be literal access.”
The Spring 2021 budget will be open for formal senatorial debate next week, and a vote will follow. It is expected to pass without any major amendments.
“The budget is constructed in a way so as to create a maximal impact on the student body in the ways the executive cabinet sees fit,” Taymuree said. “People have their experiences defined by the things we fund at USG.”
Following the budget introduction, Thuwati Aung, a senior majoring in business administration and accounting, made a statement regarding the political coup in Myanmar and its effects on USC students. According to the Associated Press, Myanmar’s military gained control of the state Monday, during it’s one-year state of emergency and with reports stating the country’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior politicians had been detained.  Aung explained the need to consider several accommodating policies, including potentially providing affected students with disability needs, class accommodations and mental health support.
“We want USC to make a public statement to raise awareness around this issue, just something saying they care about their Burmese Trojans,” Aung said.

The field of finance had always interested sophomore Rohan Sanjay, but traditional finance and stocks never appealed to him. So when he attended an electronic trading competition during his freshman year and learned about a rising investment trend — quantitative finance, the use of algorithms to predict and invest in market moves — he was immediately drawn in.
However, when he looked for a community at USC where he could learn more and exchange ideas about quant, he came up empty.
That’s when he got the idea to start QuantSC, the University’s first quantitative finance club, where he would create a community dedicated to learning about and investigating quantitative finance. 
“The field of quant, in general, was just so fascinating to me, and I saw myself kind of enjoying a career in the field long-term,” Sanjay said. “So at that point in time, I fully committed to starting to explore it more.”
Reaching out to students Steve Nguyen, Adam von Arnim and Kai Medina, together they founded the club over winter break. This semester will be their first, with Sanjay as president, Steve Nguyen as vice president of community, Adam von Arnim as vice president of projects and Kai Medina as vice president of finance. 
Von Arnim, an applied and computational mathematics and computer science major, has never been especially interested in traditional investing because he feels it is very abstract. However, for von Arnim, quant is different. 
“It’s almost difficult to say that it’s interesting to see a ticker or a symbol of a stock and say ‘Oh wow, this is amazing,’ but thinking about the math behind movements is a little bit more physical,” he said. “For that reason, I enjoy it.”
Quant investing has been around for decades, though it has grown considerably in recent years. A 2019 CNBC article estimates that quant funds now account for 20% of the total money in the stock market, meaning that 20% of the buying and selling is now controlled by algorithms rather than people making individual decisions. 
A typical quant investment technique is known as mean reversion strategy, Nguyen said. He described a typical scenario of a relatively stable stock price that fluctuates between $7 and $9.
“You can identify that price range and then implement a strategy on a platform like QuantConnect where you write it out in code and essentially the algorithm executes trades for you, where it [trades] automatically,” Nguyen said. “You’re buying it at its relative highest and selling at its relative lowest.”
For example, the algorithm could automatically sell the stock at $8.50 and buy it back once the price fell down to $7.30, Nguyen said. This process repeats, and if the algorithm is successful, the investor makes money.
The club looks to help teach members the basics of quant finance, allowing people with varying levels of expertise to join, Nguyen said. For students who come from non-programming backgrounds, the club will hold workshops to provide an introduction to development. 
From there, students will work to create their own algorithms, a process that involves research, reading and testing. 
“It’s very scientific in that you have a hypothesis about the market and how it is going to fluctuate and when the best opportunities are to buy and sell. There’s usually a lot of research papers already out there if you have an idea about something, so you can comb through research papers,” Nguyen said. “From there, you can start writing your own strategy.”
After researching and reading, members can test their algorithms based on historical data, evaluating how well they would have performed during different periods of time. Members are not limited to trading stocks, as they can also develop algorithms for other goods such as trading cards, a trend that has exploded since the beginning of the pandemic, Nguyen said.
Sanjay has considerable experience with quant, starting by building some small algorithms on his own.
“That’s how I got my first taste of algo trading and experimenting with some of my own ideas, really just learning about it and getting my feet wet,” he said.
Starting in July, Sanjay worked at a small quant firm run by a group of undergraduate students, where he continued to gain experience. As a developer, Sanjay said he played a role in building an algorithm from beginning to “production-ready code.”
Nguyen, on the other hand, is fairly new to quant trading — although he has had an interest in stocks since high school, when his older brother would come home from college and explain how the market works to him. 
Once in college himself, Nguyen maintained his interest in stocks while learning more about coding, eventually gravitating toward quant finance as a way he could combine the two fields he was interested in. 
Now, QuantSC is going through applications and preparing to establish a community dedicated to learning about, building and testing algorithms. With varied quant experience of their own, the leaders plan to help others learn, while also furthering their own knowledge of the investing trend. 
“I’m most interested in the community aspect of the club. For the first year at USC, I didn’t see a massive area for mathematically inclined students to really research [quantitative finance],” von Arnim said. “The ability to give an option to math kids and really build out that environment, that was exciting for me.”

USC kicked off Black History Month with a symposium Monday, presenting students in attendance with a brief welcome from Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs director Greedley F. Harris III. Over a backdrop of two Black students receiving their diplomas, Harris III announced the theme of Black History Month at USC: Black history in the making. 
The event, which focused on the innovations of Black alumni and recognition of the Black USC community, was hosted by CBCSA. 
Immediately following was a soulful rendition of the national anthem by Hannah Abrahim and Dominic Anzalone — both juniors majoring in performance (popular music) — performing potentially miles apart but in perfect unison.
Next in line was President Carol Folt’s speech on the history of Black innovation at USC, from the first Black USC graduate, Laura Gertrude Brown, to the renowned accomplishments of alumnus and Los Angeles architect Paul Revere Williams. 
“You each have your own story to tell,” Folt said. “Representation really makes a difference … but representation is just one of the pieces of the important work that we have to do together.”
Astronaut and alumnus Charles Bolden gave the first feature speech, beginning with an account of his childhood growing up in segregated South Carolina. Clad in a red Trojan sweater, Bolden said that “Black history is American history,” and repeated himself for emphasis — the two are inextricable. 
“It’s really important for all of us to understand that the system isn’t broken. It’s working exactly the way it was designed,” Bolden said. “There was probably never a better time, but also never a more challenging one, to foster the undoing and correcting of decades, if not centuries, of racism, bias and discrimination on which our nation was founded.” 
Among the student speakers was Olympic athlete Anna Cockrell, a track and field member and co-president of the United Black Student Athletes Association at USC. During her speech, Cockrell expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement and acknowledged the stories of Black innovators inside and out of the mainstream historical narrative.
“One thing I’m focusing on this month is learning about the Black icons in North Carolina — where I’m from — who desegregated and made a difference, who may not have been national celebrities but nonetheless changed the lives and the course history,” Cockrell said. “I’m really excited to celebrate Black people and the fact that we’re still here, in spite of all the things that have tried to stop us.” 
Natalie Hart, a doctoral student at the Rossier School of Education, reminded students watching that Black history is not just one month — it’s happening every day. 
Although she is the first in her family to pursue a doctorate, she asserted that she won’t be the last. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Hart said that as someone who identifies as Afro-Latina, she felt it was important to inspire other people with a similar background to follow her path, too. 
“I wanted to be present there and hopefully share some gems to somebody who may have been watching, that ‘Wow, that is somebody who looks like me, and she is going through the process of getting a doctorate’s degree. If she’s doing it and she’s being her authentic self, I can do it too,’” Hart said. “I hope that my presence there helps to influence someone else to know that they have the capabilities of doing it just like me, even if no one else in their family has done it before.”
Additionally, Hart backed the value of mentorship as a first generation student. Having someone who’s already gone through your own experiences makes the experience much smoother, Hart said. 
“Know that you’re already establishing a new tradition, and building history from day one as soon as you step on the campus, that is an accomplishment in itself,” she said.
Associate professor of biomedical engineering Stacey Finley also offered her perspective during the event as the first Black woman to hold a tenured position at the Viterbi School of Engineering, addressing the historical lack of Black representation in STEM fields. 
“The fact is, we’re accomplishing some kind of first,” she said. “We are making history, reaching milestones that our children will learn about and celebrate decades from now.”
Finley also detailed the rich volume of Black contributions to American history that remained overlooked in middle school curriculums — from pioneering Black novelist William Wells Brown to the Black cowboys and rancheros who made up nearly a quarter of the industry workers in the 1860s, according to the University of Oklahoma. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Finley said that during an internship at Procter & Gamble, she discovered a love for innovation that inspired her to attend graduate school. The internship’s research curriculum offered an opportunity for creativity and application by using her engineering background to answer questions in biomedicine, Finley said. For Finley, these experiences are Black history in the making: working hard on the accomplishments of the present to make an impression on future generations.
“I’m making unique and impactful contributions to the world,” she said. “In doing so, I have the ability to make history.” 
To those looking to similarly distinguish themselves, Finley emphasized the effectiveness of standing out as a minority — she advised that the handful of Black students or trainees in a field use their differences as an advantage. 
“You will already stand out. Don’t shy away from that … because it allows you to to shine, to highlight the work that you’re doing,” Finley said.
Mark Pearson, a part-time faculty member at the Rossier School of Education specializing in organizational change and leadership doctorate programs, started off his contribution to the symposium with a disclaimer: The attempt to take Capitol Hill was not a revolution based on illuminated values; it was inspired by hate. 
Instead, Pearson implored students to start a revolution based on development by starting a family, going to university or petitioning for police reform. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Pearson said he wants to extend the context of Black history that’s taught in K-12 education. 
“The most context that African-descended people are given [about] their existence begins off the coast of the Carolinas or on a plantation somewhere in the South,” Pearson said. “If you’re a Black kid growing up in the United States … that’s a significant challenge … how do you determine your worth, how do you determine your position in society?”
Pearson also emphasized the importance of framing, rather than painting, the picture of Black history in America. 
“I want to let the students guide their own ideas of what the future should be … to find their own way of making their mark on the world,” Pearson said. “[It’s] helping somebody define their own purpose … that making of history has everything to do with this process of development within the Black community, within America.”
The commencement and subsequent events for Black History Month are produced in tandem with the CBCSA, which organized its first Black convocation last fall. Future events include a panel on the perspective and experiences of Black police officers, hosted by the Sol Price School of Public Policy in partnership with the Department of Public Safety and the Black Alumni Association. A Q&A with rapper, director and actor Ice-T will also be held on the 16th. 
The most forthcoming event in USC’s Black History Month lineup is a workshop on stress and time management that will be hosted by the Center and the Kortschak Center for Learning and Creativity on Feb. 3. Additionally, USC athletics will be spotlighting prominent Black Trojans throughout the month on their website, USCBHM.com, as well as on various social media under the #USCBHM tag.

With 23,000 YouTube subscribers and 64,000 Instagram followers, Dallas Otigba is rapidly making her name known in the fashion and beauty influencer community. On top of running her highly popular social media accounts, Otigba, a junior majoring in business administration, began her own business last summer selling faux eyelashes under the company name Denimthelabel.
After her influencer account, @state.of.dallas, took off in 2019, Otigba’s followers consistently asked where her makeup and clothes were from.
“I thought, why not have a place where my supporters could directly shop from me,” Otigba said. 
From there sprouted Denimthelabel, a brand dedicated to bringing accessibility and inclusivity to the beauty industry.
“I thought eyelashes were a great way to start because you don’t need to be a makeup expert in order to wear lashes,” Otigba said. 
Denimthelabel carries nine different eyelash styles, ranging from natural to dramatic in appearance. The lash styles have names such as Bell Bottom or Dark Wash, a play off of denim as a symbol of accessibility and comfort.
When she began Denimthelabel, Otigba wanted to include young Black women as the faces of her beauty line.
“Brands didn’t really market towards people who look like me,” Otigba said. “Beauty was very, very segregated and not inclusive, so I thought I would have a brand that would include everybody.” 
Regarding diversity in the beauty industry, creators often look to launch foundation or blush products with expansive shade ranges. However, Otigba explained that she chose eyelashes specifically because they don’t have any shades or limits, making them an easily inclusive product. 
While her YouTube and Instagram followings helped catalyze the start of Denimthelabel, Otigba knew she wanted to create her own company since she was young. Her mother, Kita Lee, said she began seeing Otigba’s entrepreneurial side as young as age 8.
“She used her money to buy bulk variety packs of candy, then sold them at school during lunchtime,” Ms. Lee wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Dallas was organized at an early age … When she wants to achieve something, she will take the initiative to obtain it.”
Though her passion for business and organization started at a young age, Otigba hasn’t lost any momentum since coming to USC. From drafting emails to handpicking product designs to shipping orders, Otigba runs Denimthelabel completely independently.
“It’s a one woman show,” Otigba said. “Hopefully in the future we can grow and have a team of people and maybe even USC students, but it’s just me right now, learning literally all the aspects of running a business.”
Denimthelabel’s photographer, Danielle Pankey, a graduate from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, said Otigba independently manages the company’s creative direction on top of overseeing business operations.
“She has mood boards, she gets models, she has the clothes ready and makeup ready,” Pankey said.  “Everyone has room for growth and learning, but to start, [the creative direction] makes sense.”
With Otigba posting biweekly on her Instagram, running a YouTube channel and managing Denimthelabel all herself, it’s easy to forget that she’s a full-time business student at one of the most rigorous universities in the nation. But Otigba explained that she’s “always been a person to just do it.”
“For my classwork I keep up with my agenda book, do what I need to, and listen to the lectures and then after I’m just logged off, I can go into what I’m really passionate about which is my social media brand and my business brand,” Otigba said. “You just got to know when to turn one thing off, even though it’s quite hard for me because I’m always thinking about how to improve my personal brand and Denimthelabel so my brain is kind of working twenty-four-seven.”
Otigba’s friend Twanisha Terry, a USC graduate student studying entrepreneurship and innovation, credits Otigba’s entrepreneurial drive as setting her apart from other college students.
“Most people, when they get to college, are young and not worried about making connections. They just want to enjoy college and have a nice time, but Dallas is very mature and knows what she wants and goes after what she wants,” Twanisha said. “It feels great to see her exploring and branching out and doing everything she had listed on her list and achieving all her goals.”
Behind Otigba’s striking fashion Instagram posts and growing company lies a great deal of sacrifice, time and effort.
“I have not been able to enjoy all the college luxuries that most people at USC have. I don’t really come from a rich background either so all the money that goes into my brand and products literally has to come from me working at some other place,” Otigba said. “A lot of people go to parties, and I wouldn’t say I enjoy parties that much, but if I did want to go I wouldn’t because I know I have other things to work on like photoshoots and getting models.”
Despite her busy schedule, Otigba said that seeing her customers happy with their Denimthelabel lashes lights her up and keeps her going. Additionally, the prospect of setting an example for other young Black women entrepreneurs drives Otigba’s determination to keep working.
“There are people who look like me who feel like they can’t do it,” Otigba said. 08:18 “I know it’s kind of difficult with the odds that we’ve been dealt, but I just feel like, since I’m seeing other people do it, that gives me a little bit of hope, and I hope I can be the person to give other people inspiration.”

In all seriousness, I never thought watching “The Big Short” would become so useful to my Daily Trojan Arts & Entertainment column. That being said, I guess a group of Reddit users upending the stock market in a modern-day David vs. Goliath upset isn’t the most predictable thing, either. An almost poetic demonstration of the rule-bending hypocrisy of existing power structures that took over the internet last week, I think this is a moment in history — and, specifically, in pop culture — worth documenting. 
Now, I’m not a business major (thank God), so bear with me as I attempt to summarize what went down. Basically, a swarm of Reddit users in a Reddit threat called r/WallStreetBets screwed over hedge-fund billionaires — big time. GameStop, along with other companies such as AMC and Nokia, has been down bad thanks to the pandemic’s financial consequences and general trouble in the retail world. Rich hedge-fund guys (we’ll call them finance bros, for clarity’s sake) were able to bet that GameStop would, in a word, fail because the stock market allows traders to bet against companies like GameStop and profit if the value of the asset falls — this is called “shorting” a stock. Given the dismal state of the economy and predictable shift toward oblivion for retail companies like GameStop, the finance bros’ shorting plan seemed foolproof. 
That is, until Reddit users took to Robinhood, a user-friendly app that makes it easy for the average person to trade stocks, and invested en masse (we’re talking millions of shares) in GameStop. This effectively increased the value of the asset, contrary to what the finance bros predicted. In economic terms, this is referred to as a “short squeeze,” in which a stock jumps sharply, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses. 
The magnitude of the squeeze was such that it started bleeding over into other threatened companies, such as AMC and Nokia. Financial data company S3 Partners said on Jan. 27 that its analysis found that short-sellers (finance bros) had lost $23.6 billion on GameStop this month, spelling big bucks for amateur Reddit traders. The same day, GameStop’s share price reached $380 , cementing a 1,700% rise in its stock value this January.
What seemed like a well-deserved victory for the masses was abysmally short-lived, however. The next day, Jan. 28, Robinhood and other brokers restricted trading in several securities (including GameStop, Nokia and AMC — the latter of which also saw its shares soar by almost 300%), blocking buyers from purchasing additional shares while allowing hedge funds to freely sell and trade them as they saw fit. It’s like a soccer or basketball game where the team you like is winning, so the ref decides to add an extra 20 minutes but bans your guys from touching the ball — objectively unjust on its face. The decision made by Robinhood (and whichever big dogs their management is in cahoots with) prompted widespread outrage and swift legal obstacles: Some Reddit users have joined a class-action suit against the platform, alleging it manipulated the market by restricting trades. 
Again, I’m not a business major — I’m a psychology major. So, while giving the context of the short squeeze is necessary to understand its implications, I’m much more interested in examining this issue through a sociological lens than an economic one.
For one, the collective outrage at Robinhood’s decision to restrict trading has united figures from opposite sides of the political spectrum — a rare occurrence in our increasingly partisan, polarized world. A week ago, would you have believed me if I told you that Donald Trump Jr. and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would have even remotely reconcilable stances on a hot-button topic? Well, believe it: Ocasio-Cortez called swiftly for a congressional hearing to investigate Robinhood’s decision, while Trump Jr. tweeted: “It took less than a day for big tech, big government and the corporate media to spring into action and begin colluding to protect their hedge fund buddies on Wall Street. This is what a rigged system looks like, folks!” 
As I followed the scandal’s progression on social media, I picked up on emotions ranging from incredulous shock to cynical contempt and unfettered rage. It was messy — the reaction one might expect when a fundamental building block of the economy is, in the span of 24 hours, broken down and exposed for its reliance on sustaining uneven power structures, pandering to the wealthy and throwing everyone else under the bus when it’s convenient.
The nature of the market manipulation was blatant and shameless, rendering it impossible to ignore no matter what your politics are. Let’s take a look at a couple of tweets that stood out to me in the aftermath of the short squeeze, tweets that I feel capture the heart of this controversy.
@BethLynch2020 tweeted, “no, for real, the stock market soared to record highs as 400,000 people died, and as 50 million people filed for unemployment, billionaires became $1 trillion richer. But, now that regular people are gaming it, these criminals want regulations.”
 I mean, really? The Wall Street establishment has historically and consistently treated the market like a Vegas casino, but now that ‘“regular people” have cracked the code, suddenly it’s a dire legal problem demanding immediate attention. 
@rudy_betrayed pointed out, “remember when senators got coronavirus briefings before the public and sold off millions of dollars in stocks before the crash last year and faced no consequences and no regulation? then reddit made one stock into a meme and they’re talking about restructuring the whole market.” I think this one speaks for itself. No comment.
My personal favorite came from user @JYSexton, who tweeted, “Robin Hood marketing itself as a business to ‘democratize investment’ and then capitulating to the demands of the elite few is a great time to remember that businesses sell themselves on progressive sloganeering in order to profit off your political sensibilities.” 
The irony is overwhelming. You couldn’t write it better: Robinhood, a platform named after a vigilante who stole from the rich to give back to the poor, has come under fire for stealing from the poor to protect the rich. The so-called “free” market looks a lot like a sheep in wolf’s clothing to me.
I am not economically savvy, and I have no idea how this issue will progress or how the market will react and evolve because of it. However, Robinhood’s decision to restrict trading on Thursday confirmed my greatest fear and that of many others: The uber-wealthy — in this case, hedge-fund billionaires in particular — will always get what they want. Until the system is reformed, until checks and balances are implemented and until legislators work actively to circumvent the disproportionate allocation of capital, hedge-fund billionaires will always get bailed out and working-class people will always end up paying the price in their place. If you weren’t sure of that before, you better be now. 
As a journalist, I feel an obligation to observe, report and analyze. I feel inclined to ask what the past week’s events and our collective reaction to them say about us and about the world we live in. Oftentimes, I turn to social media to explore these questions because I do believe it will be the enduring mythology of our generation, the stuff of textbooks for generations to come. 
I pitched this column in the hope of discussing pop culture from a sociopolitical lens and getting to do just that has only reinforced that the vehicles of expression that surround us most intimately — Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit — offer an excellent glimpse into the zeitgeist of the twenty-first century. Last week was a jarring, memorable example of how connected our channels of communication are to our identities, and it’s a crazy thing to think about.

On Tuesday, USC’s men’s golf team made the trip to Kamuela, Hawaii to play in the Amer Ari Invitational. The Tournament runs through Thursday and is being played at the Hapuna Golf Club. USC is one of seven teams from outside of Hawaii to compete in the tournament this year. 
USC placed 12th out of 20 teams in last year’s Amer Ari Invitational, finishing at 3-under par. Pepperdine won at 39-under par. This will be the Trojans’ second tournament of the season after placing sixth at 36-over 900 in the Southwest Invitational in Westlake Village, Calif., last week. 
Junior Cameron Henry finished 16th at 6-over 222 in last week’s season opener, while senior Kaito Onishi tied for 20th at 8-over 224. Freshman Shane Ffrench showed promise in his collegiate debut and finished tied for first after the first round at 2-under. Ffrench struggled in tough wind conditions, falling to even par on day two and finishing the tournament tied for 26th at 10-over 226. Senior Leon D’Souza also struggled with these conditions tying for 48th at 18-over 234. Sophomore Tyler Guo tied for 60th at 22-over 238. 
Some of the biggest struggles for first-year head coach J.T. Higgins’ team in Westlake were putting and managing its par-5s. 
“We didn’t putt very well… [we had] too many three-putts,” Higgins said in an interview with Daily Trojan. “At home we have been amazing on the par-5s and we played those really poorly.”  
Higgins joined USC this offseason from Texas A&M where he led the men’s golf team to an NCAA championship and 17 NCAA tournament appearances in 19 years. 
Some rust was expected as the Southwest Invitational was the first tournament in almost a year for USC after their Spring and Fall 2020 seasons were cancelled due to coronavirus. The fall season usually provides an important opportunity for practice and tournament play for both new and returning players. 
“I think most of the guys didn’t have tournaments for a long time so I feel like for the next event we will feel more comfortable under the pressure,” Onishi said. “But I think the team is in great shape.” 
This week Higgins and company will get another chance to meet their target scores. USC will face many of the same teams they did last week, such as Arizona State and Pepperdine, both of which finished above USC in second and fifth place, respectively. The Trojans will also face Georgia Tech, which finished only two shots behind USC in Westlake. 
Higgins and USC hope to remain competitive through the end of this tournament against these teams and show their capabilities.
“Pepperdine and Arizona State are two of the best teams in the country and we played them this week,” Higgins said. “They were much better than us this week, so we are gonna play a lot better to compete with them.” 
Other Pac-12 schools are competing in Hawaii as well, such as Washington and Oregon State. The tournament presents a competitive field, but the Trojans feel confident in their abilities. 
“I feel like our best is as good as anyone’s best,” Henry said. “So if the whole team plays together, I feel like we can compete at the highest level with the best teams in the Pac-12 and in the country, so I feel optimistic about our team.” 
Coach Higgins feels the team can do a better job at managing their emotions and keeping composure. He feels this will come as the team gets into the flow of playing competitive golf again. 
“I think just staying patient is important,” Henry said. “I know some guys on the team can get flustered over a bad shot or a bad break, but you can’t waste your energy over something that you can’t control.”

Students love to fantasize about college being their first taste of the real world, freedom and independence. Similarly, parents consider these four years of undergraduate education to be the most instrumental in shaping their children’s futures. USC embraces this idea of existing in the “real world” quite literally; its structure is a microcosm of greater American society and government. The resemblance at a student-level is uncanny, with our Undergraduate Student Government formed through a combination of appointees and elected officials just like our federal government. 
Unfortunately, yet not at all surprisingly, our University’s institutionalized anti-Black policies and elitist conduct mimic that of the federal government and the officials in Los Angeles all too well. 
The Los Angeles Police Department is one of the most violent in the country, shooting an average of 45 victims each year. Since May and the beginning of a series of mass protests, Black Lives Matter LA data tracking revealed that officers fatally shot 11 people. 
The USC response? Well, for one, the USC community waited for five days after George Floyd’s murder before receiving a performative statement from President Carol Folt. Beyond that, the administration failed to meet students’ growing demands for a strong anti-racist institutional stance. Activists have been pointing to numerous administrative policies that perpetuate anti-Blackness both on and off campus, including the disproportionate policing of Black students and community members by the Department of Public Safety and the immortalization of a known eugenicist and a former USC president. 
Pair these blatantly insensitive and discriminatory practices with the testimonials of Black students on campus evidenced through the @black_at_usc_ Instagram account, an anonymous student testimonials page of the experiences of Black students on campus, and we arrive at the image of a university fundamentally at odds with its mission to champion “the development of human beings and society as a whole through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit.”
Diversity, equity and inclusion are words that cannot be thrown around lightly. It is a travesty for the University to take a surface-level oath promising to ensure these three pillars are met for every single Trojan yet fail to enact substantive reform. 
USC is one of the richest and most well-connected schools in the country, yet as the old adage goes, with great power comes great responsibility. This phrasing suggests that the powerful automatically embrace a sense of duty to a greater purpose, which is hardly ever the case. Having great power must come with great responsibility because power without responsibility is fundamentally unchecked abuse. 
Universities are microcosms — small worlds emblematic of the larger society. If our University is to be representative of the American people, then USC needs to work far harder to achieve true inclusivity. 
This means critically evaluating and implementing the demands from student organizers in recognized student organizations such as the Black and Latinx student assemblies and USC Students Against Labor Exploitation. This means hiring more Black and Indigenous staff, divesting from DPS and most importantly making a concerted effort to diversify the student body. Students of color, in particular Black, Indigenous and Latinx students, want to attend universities that recognize their lived experiences rather than ignore them. Every student desires a university that works in their best interest, not one that bends its morals under the weight of a more prominent, wealthier force. 
Fostering a vibrant educational environment means serving those in the surrounding communities as well. USC can do far more to connect with the public high schools in Downtown Los Angeles and provide them with educational and extracurricular programming, thereby doing its part to combat the pervasive educational inequities that elite institutions inherently tend to perpetuate.
We are living in a historic moment, one of intense division yet simultaneously a fervent desire for transformative change. The University can engage in the latter, but only if the administration realizes that the USC image thrives because of our community of students and faculty, not in spite of it. Instilling a strong, Universitywide commitment to equity within all Trojans demands administrative action first. Listen to the students who genuinely want to see the University progress, and fight on alongside them — not against them.

The stage is set and the Kansas City Chiefs are going up against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV. It’s Patrick Mahomes vs. Tom Brady, the future vs. the past. As you’d expect, I’m happy for my Chiefs and rooting for them to run it back. 
However, there’s still a lot to be concerned about in light of the Super Bowl’s health risks and the everpresent pandemic which continues to rage on. 
First, we should think about what will happen on-site at the Super Bowl in Tampa Bay. 
In terms of attendants, the NFL is giving out 7,500 free tickets to vaccinated health care workers, and all 32 teams are following suit by allocating their own free tickets to local health care workers as well. The University of Kansas Health System, located primarily in Kansas City, said it received 18 tickets. 22,000 fans are allowed into Tampa Bay’s Raymond James Stadium, which seats approximately 66,000. So assuming that around one-third of the game’s attendees are already vaccinated, it will be safer than most sporting events this year that allowed fans.
Still, even if the NFL properly distances fans throughout the stadium, being vaccinated does not mean you cannot still spread the virus. Some people and groups fail to realize that the virus can exist and transfer to others even if you are vaccinated, so if an unvaccinated fan and a vaccinated one interact, spreading could occur. The NFL needs to be careful in how they let fans move around in the stadium and interact with each other.
After the game, travel will pose dangers as well. Although most Tampa fans that show up won’t have to trek far to get back home, Kansas City fans and other spectators will be traveling back to various parts across the country, so there is reason for concern there. 
The Buccaneers will be playing a Super Bowl in their own stadium, the first time this has occurred in NFL history. So at least, on their end, it will be safer since they are right next to home. But, the Chiefs are planning to arrive in Tampa just a day before the game. Usually, teams come a week in advance of the Super Bowl to prepare in that location’s climate. The Chiefs doing this might not be best logistically or strategically, but it definitely makes things safer for them. 
By having the team stay in Tampa for as short a time as possible, they won’t run as big of a risk of spreading the virus. Since this will be the last game until the fall, all parties involved will hope things go smoothly. 
Still, look out for coronavirus to make some players ineligible to play right up until kickoff. Two players on the Chiefs, offensive lineman Daniel Kilgore and wide receiver Demarcus Robinson, are on the coronavirus reserve list already. Also, the NFL is willing to remove players from the field when necessary. In December, Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Dez Bryant was ruled out when he tested positive for coronavirus right before kickoff against the Dallas Cowboys.
The more important thing here is the potential implication of the Super Bowl acting as a superspreader event in homes across the country. Super Bowl parties are one of America’s most beloved traditions, and this is the first time Americans will be hosting theirs during a pandemic.
As we saw in Los Angeles in 2020, people tend to congregate for sporting events, especially when their team wins a championship.
Now, with the Super Bowl, the same health dangers may arise again. In pre-pandemic circumstances, almost 100 million people in the nation gather together at homes across the country to watch the Super Bowl. So if we even come close to that amount, it will not bode well for mitigating the spread of the coronavirus.
In Los Angeles County, public health officials are advising against any type of gatherings.
“It will be tragic if the Super Bowl becomes a super-spreader of coronavirus,” said Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the L.A. County Department of Public Health director.
Cases are finally dropping nationwide to almost 150,000 per day, but we are nowhere close to the end, so it is critical that people just watch the Big Game at home. 
It will be important to monitor how cases fluctuate after Sunday and the weeks to come. Those fluctuations will indicate how well Americans did staying at home and being socially distant. Nevertheless, I am hoping for a great game on Sunday and go Chiefs!

I remember the first time I was called a faggot. 
I wore a pair of Toms to school in sixth grade, and for some reason it was the most polarizing day in the history of Desert Ridge Middle School. It’s a unisex shoe, but when you’re a sixth grade boy, only elephant-sized tennis shoes are socially acceptable (I was 6 feet tall with a 28-inch waist size and narrow heels at age 13 — miniscule articles of clothing actually fit me). 
My faux-confidence took a swaggering blow as the “jocks” — I call them this because they wore basketball shorts in freezing weather yet neglected to wear deodorant — uttered hideous slurs in the hallway and could not disconnect their gaze from my feet. I don’t judge what anyone does in the bedroom, but I would not be surprised if these people had foot fetishes 10 years later. 
As I grew older, I began to vehemently despise jock and football culture for the people it produced. These same people harassed me, held crooked wires up to my face and told me that I was “as straight as this” and seemed to be more obsessed with my sexuality than I was. Sure, this behavior is a by-product of our heteronormative society and insecure masculinity, but it also sheds light on the toxic pervasiveness of football culture in the United States. 
With Super Bowl Sunday coming up, I am very indifferent to who wins. In contrast, I am concerned about the aftermath; I have no doubt in my mind that households will host mass gatherings despite coronavirus safety concerns. Universities are still not open and local businesses are struggling, yet sports could not be sacrificed for the sake of a pandemic that has taken the lives of over 400,000 Americans. Ultimately, these priorities reveal a twisted logic that undermines the sanctity of human life in favor of a corrupt American staple: football. 
Besides my experiences, sports culture historically promotes misogyny and homophobia. It intertwines closely with “locker-room talk,” a term that often refers to how men talk behind closed doors. It is notorious for fostering “guy talk,” which condones sexualizing women and tossing out “faggot” like new slang — I know because I have used male locker rooms. 
Of course, not all men in sports act like this, but it’s a paradigm. According to a 2014 study by Sam Houston State University, “male-inclusive groups, such as fraternities, segments of the military, and sports teams, are 300% more likely to commit sexualized violence than their non-affiliated male peers.” In another study, conducted by FiveThirtyEight, “it was found that the rate of domestic violence arrests in the NFL relative to other violent crimes was 48%, more than double the national rate of 21%.” Sexualized violence is a trademark of sports culture, and we cannot talk about football culture in the United States without recognizing these misogynistic facets of it. 
As a matter of fact, Donald Trump, the same man who defended his “grab her by the pussy” comments as “locker-room talk,” boasted that he “brought back Big Ten football.” College football this past fall was originally canceled due to coronavirus concerns, but because Americans cannot last a year without the thrill, spirit and camaraderie of football season, we deemed it as more important than actual coronavirus relief, a collapsing economy and a country crippled by a pandemic that was controlled within months by other countries such as Australia.  
Now, with the Super Bowl steadily approaching, we nearly made it through the season, right? Well, although the NFL enacted strict coronavirus safety protocols, such as mandatory virtual or socially-distanced outdoor meetings, several teams have experienced outbreaks, particularly the Baltimore Ravens, whose outbreak was traced back to their conditioning coach who failed to report his symptoms and neglected to wear a mask. 
Additionally, I am not the only person worried about a super spreader event. Los Angeles County Health officials pinpointed mass gatherings held among people from different households as a “primary driver of coronavirus transmission.” On top of that, we nationally witnessed mass celebrations in the streets of Tuscaloosa following Alabama’s National Championship victory. Not to mention the fact that the University of Notre Dame had to enact mandatory universitywide coronavirus testing after students stormed the school’s football field and hosted weekend parties after they defeated Clemson. We have learned by now that we cannot put these irresponsibilities past the reckless people in this country.
Furthermore, the NFL faces a massive revenue setback worth billions, which is especially disconcerting for corporations that rely on the NFL for advertising (oh no) and the athletes who are being exploited for profit. However, if this does not epitomize the structural faults in our economic system, what does? As a national culture so rooted in misogyny, disrespect for others and conceit, the NFL serves as a prime example of some of the most corrosive aspects of the U.S. that we must confront. 
Frankly, I am pessimistic about what will happen on Sunday, and I have been critical about the negative aspects of football culture for my entire life. Speaking from a more optimistic point of view, perhaps there is a way to reform it. Alas, we cannot reform an institution that will simply cease to exist if the U.S. continues to prove that it cannot calibrate its priorities.

USC men’s volleyball was set to open its 2021 season this week, but a positive coronavirus test within the program derailed its plans.
USC had to postpone its Jan. 30 season opener at UCLA, Feb. 4 match at home against Pepperdine and Feb. 6 match at Grand Canyon. With just a 14-game condensed regular season schedule to play this season, the Trojans will look to get back to work soon.
Head coach Jeff Nygaard said the team’s appreciation for this season has grown since the news of the cancellation.
“If you deny people the ability to play the sport that they love long enough, they really start learning that they love it and that it’s a part of them,” Nygaard said. “Yesterday, back in the gym … I didn’t see a single ounce of anybody not going hard, not playing hard [and] not competing.”
In their last full season in 2019 the Trojans had their best season under Nygaard, doubling their win total from 2018 as they went 18-11 overall and 7-5 in Pac-12 play. With most of last year’s team coming back for this shortened season senior libero Cole Paxson feels the team’s experiences can give it an advantage. 
“I am very confident in this team this year,” Paxson said. “We pretty much brought back everyone. We are looking older this year and got a lot of seniors that can be playing on the court at the same time.” 
The extended offseason for the Trojans has allowed the team to put some valuable time into preparation. Paxson has noticed his teammates have come out improved and aggressive this season. 
“It seems like a lot of people took the offseason pretty seriously,” Paxson said. “We got a lot of older guys, and the younger guys who came through, who put in a lot of work this offseason and look like they are hitting the ball pretty hard.”
Senior setter Chris Hall described the opportunity the new season brings and how being conscious of the coronavirus can be a huge advantage for this USC squad.  
“I think one of our best advantages could be being responsible and staying healthy,” Hall said. “Generally just having everyone in the gym is what we want.”
With so many seniors on the roster, leadership within the team is strong this season. Hall mentioned the players hosting Zoom calls with freshmen as a great way to acclimate the new players. 
“We really have a culture of bringing in the new guys and making them feel at home,” Hall said. “We did a ton of Zoom meetings, acclimating the freshmen to everything they need to know.”
Due to coronavirus protocols, the Trojans will play back to back matches against the same opponent on weekends throughout the season. This includes taking on Concordia and Stanford three times in a row on back-to-back weekends.
With this new format to the MPSF season, USC will become quite familiar with the same opponents after taking them on twice a row. Nygaard said the irregular schedule can pose new challenges for the Trojans.
“In terms of a scouting report, you do not have to make huge adjustments,” Nygaard said. “It’s going to be a unique season; there’s no question.”
Nygaard said the team was motivated in team scrimmages by the opportunity to be named in the starting lineup for the season opener.
“There was quite a premium by the guys as to who was going to get to compete against UCLA in that [game],” Nygaard said. “I like the fact that if we are to play our rival the first week … I like that that gives a sense of urgency to the team.”
In an odd season with so few opponents the goal for the Trojans remains the same. 
“The team goal is to win a national title,” Hall said.
The Trojans will start their quest for a national championship when they take on crosstown rival UCLA on Feb. 13 at Pauley Pavilion to open the 2021 season.
