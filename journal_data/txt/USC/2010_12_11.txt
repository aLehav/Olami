Junior college cornerback Isiah Wiley (Yuma, Ariz.), a three-star prospect according to Rivals.com, announced his commitment to USC today.
“He committed last week,” said Arizona Western C.C. coach Tom Minnick in a story published by the ESPN affiliated website WeAreSC.com.  “He’s a pretty good player, he’s the best corner in our conference and he’s not afraid to hit you. He also has great ball skills.”
Wiley, who has recorded 44 tackles and three interceptions through 10 games, had originally committed to Arkansas last summer shortly after USC was sanctioned by the NCAA and placed on four years probation, which included a two-year bowl ban.
A native of Louisiana, Wiley had committed to Alabama out of high school, but did not qualify.
According to Minnick, however, Wiley expects to enroll at USC this January and be eligible to participate in spring practice, giving the Trojans their sixth midyear addition.
He will have two years of eligibility remaining.

It is often difficult to defeat a team three times in one season.
Fortunately for No. 6 USC women’s volleyball, this proved to be true for No. 3 Stanford.
After losing both regular season matches to the Cardinal, the Women of Troy were able to win when it mattered most, defeating Stanford and earning a spot in the Final Four.
USC won Saturday’s Elite Eight match in Dayton, Ohio, in five sets, 20-25, 25-17, 22-25, 26-24 and 16-14.
Freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana showed why she was worthy of her Pac-10 Freshman of the Year title, recording a team-high 25 kills in the match, along with four blocks. Fellow outside hitter Alex Jupiter added 22 kills, while middle blocker Lauren Williams had 13.
In October, Stanford handed the Women of Troy their second loss of the season with a four-set win at the Galen Center. The Cardinal also swept USC in Palo Alto when the teams met again a month later.
USC advanced to Saturday’s game after sweeping Indiana on Friday night. The Women of Troy opened the tournament last weekend with a three-game sweep of New Mexico, followed by a four-set win against San Diego to make it back to the Sweet 16. Both of these first two games were at the Galen Center.
The Women of Troy have now won 15 of their last 16 matches.
USC joins the No. 4 Penn State Nittany Lions in the Final Four. The Women of Troy will face off against the winner of Saturday’s match between two Pac-10 teams, No. 7 California and Washington. The fourth and final spot will be occupied by either No. 9 Texas or No. 16 Purdue.
The Final Four will take place next weekend in Kansas City. If USC comes away with a victory on Thursday, it will advance to the NCAA championship game Saturday, Dec. 18 at 5:30 p.m. PST, which will be aired on ESPN2.

After a 17-point win against No. 20 Texas, and with the Trojans set to face three ranked opponents over the next four games, Saturday afternoon’s match-up against Northern Arizona had all the makings of a “trap game.”
“We did not want to overlook [NAU] coming off a big win against Texas,” senior guard Donte Smith said. “We overlooked Rider, and we did not want to do that again.”
Donte Smith scored a career-high 22 points in USC's win over Northern Arizona. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans did not initially take the Lumberjacks (7-3) lightly. USC (6-4) held NAU, who entered the game ranked eighth in the country in three-point shooting percentage, to one-of-seven shooting from beyond the arc and only 19 points in the first half.
In the second half, the Lumberjacks made four of their first six three-point attempts, and cut the Trojans’ lead to three with 9:27 left in the game. At that point, Donte Smith caught fire, scoring all of USC’s points during the Trojans’ 14-3 run. Smith finished the game with a career-high 22 points.
“Donte really stepped up for us,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “That is kind of an understatement. What he did tonight won the game for us.”
USC held on to win 60-52.
The Trojans outrebounded the Lumberjacks 41-29, behind 11 rebounds from senior forward Alex Stepheson and 10 from junior forward Nikola Vucevic.
Sophomore guard Gabe Rogers paced the Lumberjacks, scoring 20 points, including six made three-point shots.
The Trojans are about to embark on their toughest non-conference road trip of the season. USC travels to play at No. 4 Kansas on Dec. 18, and at No. 13 Tennessee on Dec. 21 before returning home to play against Lehigh on Dec. 23. Junior guard Jio Fontan, a transfer from Fordham, will be eligible to play for the first time against Kansas and is expected to start and contribute immediately for the Trojans, who have played with only a seven-man rotation this season.
“We are getting better as a team,” O’Neill said. “We have had two good weeks of practice. With the teams we have coming up, we better be getting better as a team.”

The headline on Rivals.com’s USC website currently reads: “USC is still USC,” referencing the program’s recruiting dominance for much of the past decade, during which top-five classes were reeled in regularly. That dominance, it seems, is going to continue.
Despite USC football’s 8-5 season, the team’s sub-par performance on the field doesn’t appear to be having any adverse effects on the recruiting trail, as five-star wide receiver prospect George Farmer (Gardena, Calif.) committed to USC Friday night.
“I called up Coach [Lane] Kiffin and said I was ready to be a Trojan,” Farmer said in a story published on ESPN.com. “He was real excited and so was I and I’m ready to get there and help USC win a national championship. USC has great athletes, my boy [former high school teammate] Robert Woods is there and I just fit in really well there.”
Farmer, No. 4 in the Rivals100 and the No. 1 wideout in the country, was a teammate of Woods at Gardena Serra last year when the Cavaliers won a state championship.
“Farmer is not only a physically fantastic wide receiver, but also a fine safety prospect,” wrote ESPN recruiting analyst Tom Luginbill. “If he stays on offense and with USC’s limited numbers, he should see the field early and could be an impact player for quarterback Matt Barkley, just as Woods was this season.”
With more than 1,300 yards and 13 touchdowns this season, Farmer anticipates success as well.
“I’m coming in to win national championships,” Farmer told Ben Bolch of the Los Angeles Times. “We’ve got a lot of talent there, a lot of five-star athletes. We’re coming and we’re going to do our thing and hopefully the sanctions won’t mess us up.”
So far, Farmer is the 17th commitment to USC’s class, which is now ranked 7th in the country by Rivals.com.
Yes sirrr!!!
Since Auburn’s Heisman recipient has lots of controversy about him, shouldn’t USC be given an appeal? Make it fair NCAA! conducting witch-hunts on SC shows favoritism for the SEC.
We’ll be back.
