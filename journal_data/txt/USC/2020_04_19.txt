From her first violin lesson at age 3 to years of concert recitals and performances throughout high school, junior Jillian Khoo had always imagined studying music in college. But her plans to become a musician changed when she discovered her second passion in high school: computer science. Now a Viterbi School of Engineering scholar who still participates in musical performances, Khoo is able to make time for both of her passions.
It was upon taking her first computer science class in high school that Khoo realized the traits she had used to excel in music, such as recognizing patterns, could be applied to computer science. 
“The whole idea is that you can have this big picture in your mind but you really need to be able to zoom in on those smaller details like a single function within a larger program, or a single note or phrase within a larger piece,” said Khoo, a computer science major.
Khoo continues to combine creativity with science by contributing to STEM communities on campus, including AthenaHacks and Code the Change, and participating in instrumental groups such as the Thornton Symphony and Google orchestras.
Last fall, Khoo was also named the first USC Neo Scholar nominated by a past internship. Since joining the scholar program, Khoo said Neo, a scouting network aimed at helping young engineers jumpstart their careers by connecting them with startups and investors, has been helpful in providing insight on prospective careers scholars are considering. 
“Everyone has been extremely friendly and extremely helpful with providing me and the other students with super helpful career advice on things we should learn or look into,” Khoo said. “It’s super inspiring to get to talk to these people and hear what their take is on the future of computer science and what they’re doing to kind of pay it forward.”
Despite pursuing computer science full time, Khoo has not abandoned her first love of music and continues to cultivate her craft in her free time. Last summer, she played for the company orchestra during her internship at Google. During her freshman year, she also played in the Thornton Symphony as the only non-music major. 
Shawn Shamsian, a computer science professor who witnessed firsthand Khoo’s skill with computer science when she was a student in his algorithms design class, said he was not surprised that Khoo was also involved in musical performance. Khoo is now a TA for his “Introductions to Algorithms and Theory of Computing” course.
Shamsian said he had seen studies calling the process of coding and music similar in design. In one study conducted by the Huffington Post in 2016, researchers found that attention to detail and innate perfectionism were important characteristics of excellent coders and musicians.
“In the old days when there weren’t a lot of people that knew about coding, people actually recognized that musicians can become very good coders,” Shamsian said. “The way your mind works when you understand music, it translates well to basically write structured code.”
During her freshman year, Khoo was selected to participate in Hack Music L.A., a weekend-long hackathon in the Walt Disney Concert Hall where her team, made up of artists, musicians and technologists from across the United States, created a visual performance dependent on changes in the musical piece, including volume and pitch. 
“A common thing that modern audiences are struggling with when they go to a classical music performance is that they don’t know where to look,” Khoo said. “It sounds nice, but they just need a little more visual stimulation. Based on the performance that was being given, we were able to take in all of the performance data and turn it into a visual light show that was completely generated by the music.”
Michael Shindler, a former USC professor, hired Khoo as a course producer, a student who provides additional help in labs and office hours, after she excelled in his “Discrete Methods in Computer Science” course. Unsurprised by Khoo’s interest in music performance, Shindler said he understands a critical similarity between learning the two subjects that explains Khoo’s passion for each. 
“[In computer science, there’s] a way you come up with the right numbers by following directions and then there’s a way where you understand why you do the steps you do,” Shindler said. “There’s something similar with music — if you are playing piano, you can move your fingers to the right keys and press the right pedals at the right time to produce the desired sound.”
As she finds the intersection between two seemingly opposite subjects, Khoo urges students who are interested in two unrelated fields to identify a problem in one field that can be solved with tools from the other. 
“It’s not like you can just wake up one morning and say ‘Oh, I want to combine music and technology. Step zero is ‘How do you want to connect these?’” Khoo said. “The most important thing is looking at a field like the arts and trying to find a problem that you think you can solve with your other fields … looking around and seeing where there are gaps in that field and how you can contribute with your outside perspective.”

On May 24, I walked into Spoke and Weal’s SoHo salon and walked out six hours later with pink hair.
I’m crystal clear on the date because there are two photos from that day saved in my camera roll. In the before shot, my hair is long, dark and virginal. I’m smiling, though a frisson of tension hovers around my mouth. In the second, my hair is a bright bubblegum pink, a far cry from the pastel hue I’d envisioned. My expression: sheer consternation. I’d sent that photo to all my friends with the caption: “I’ve made a mistake.”
I don’t remember when I started toying with the idea of dyeing my hair pink. I think it started with Fernanda Ly, the poster girl for pink-haired Asians, and her Teen Vogue cover. Thumbing through her photoshoot, enthralled by her cotton candy-colored strands and thick, blunt bangs, I wondered, “Wow, could that be me?”  
As quickly as the thought came, I dismissed it. Of course that couldn’t be me. I’m not a 5-foot-8 model who’s walked for Louis Vuitton and starred in a Chanel campaign. Also, my parents would never go for it. 
That was in 2015. Since then, pink hair’s popularity has risen to a fever pitch. Every beauty publication — Allure, Glamour, InStyle — ran articles gushing over the trend. A sea of rose gold waves flooded Pinterest boards. High-profile celebrities such as Kylie Jenner and BTS’ Jimin debuted their new rosy tresses on Instagram. Then e-girls came on the scene, and, well, I can’t say that my decision wasn’t partially influenced by my fascination with Belle Delphine. 
What sealed the deal for me, though, was watching Mi-Anne Chan dye her hair pink for her Refinery29 series “Beauty with Mi.” Here was someone who wasn’t a multimillionaire celebrity or an Instagram influencer; she was just a journalist who worked for one of my favorite outlets. In her video titled “I Dyed My Virgin Hair For the First Time,” Chan documents the process from start to finish, talks about the experience of bleaching her whole head and recommends products for her new hair care routine. When I finished the video, I determined right there and then: “Fuck it, I’m gonna do it.” 
Determined to recreate Chan’s exact experience, I went to the same salon in the video, and even booked the same colorist. I sat in a chair for five hours as bleach ate away at the melanin in my hair, my scalp prickling with the sensation of fire ants crawling all over my head. 
When it was finally over and the stylist gave me back my glasses, I looked in the mirror and felt faint all over. My head was magenta. She assured me that it would fade in no time, that the brightness was just to ensure that the color wouldn’t disappear too quickly. I nodded, paid her an exorbitant amount and scurried home in dismay, snapping the selfie in my camera roll along the way. 
But I needn’t have worried; she was right. After a week and a thorough rinse in the shower, the shade faded into the soft fairy-floss pink of my dreams, and I haven’t looked back since.
It’s faintly astonishing to me that I’ve had pink hair for nearly a year now. It feels both so long ago and like yesterday that I made the plunge. I can say with certainty, however, that dyeing my hair pink has changed my life.     
I’d never noticed before how much I relied on my hair as a security blanket. I used it to shield my face, a curtain that I could retreat behind whenever I felt shy or awkward. Long, thick and dark, it was a de facto invisibility cloak, allowing me to blend in and disappear. 
Once I went pink, though, hiding became impossible. My hair was no longer an attention deflector but an attention magnet. Everywhere I went, strangers came up to me to compliment it, to ask how long it took and what products I used on it. Everyone from Starbucks baristas to Uber drivers told me they liked my hair.  
With pink hair, I felt … cool. As someone with the personality of a shrinking violet, my hair dragged me out of my comfort zone and forced me to act like how I thought a pink-haired person would act — bold and arresting, at ease in their own skin; someone who didn’t give a shit about what other people thought. Unnatural hair color is no substitute for a personality, but my newfound confidence didn’t supplant my identity so much as evolve it. 
Every two months, I go to the salon to touch up my roots. I white-knuckle my way through two hours of chemicals soaking into my brain, dealing with dandruff the size of snowflakes, just so I can keep feeling like that. Well, I used to.
The last time I went to get my roots bleached was back in February, and as my salon is temporarily shuttered due to the coronavirus, I have no idea when I can make another appointment. When I wake up in the morning, I notice the darkness at the crown of my head gain another centimeter. I wash my hair once a week and watch the water circle the drain; when I step out, I’m a little more blonde, a little less strawberry. 
But you know what? I’m not worried about it. It’s been almost a year, and I no longer feel like an impostor pretending to be someone I’m not. I’ve fully grown into my pink hair; I don’t need to lean on it like a crutch anymore. 
When we get out, maybe I’ll go lavender. Or blue. Or silver. Who knows? After all, I’m young, and the future stretches out before me, shimmering with possibility.

“Sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll.” That’s the lifestyle the latest Netflix film “Betonrausch” (“Rising High” in English), attempts to emulate. The German production, directed by Cüneyt Kaya, can be considered a weaker version of “The Wolf of Wall Street,” only on a different continent and with much less impact. 
“Rising High” is a dramatized white-collar crime film that tells the story of Viktor (David Kross), a young realtor whose personality turned out to be extremely bland — but that doesn’t even make a difference given the dull course of the film. Through flashbacks, the film reveals that Viktor’s desire to ascend the corporate social ladder comes from his early childhood, when he saw his hardworking and devoted father (Robert Schupp) financially struggle. 
Themes of extreme wealth, drugs, prostitution and great ambition are present throughout the entire movie. Pulsating neon lights at parties, a constant flow of champagne, high-end suits — everything is there, but the script supporting it failed to consider character depth and development. 
Because Viktor doesn’t have the means to achieve immediate popularity and wealth, he begins by pretending he does — after all, who would doubt a man with copious amounts of gel in his hair smiling in a nicely tailored suit? He partners up with Gerry (Frederick Lau), a low-life and somewhat of a grumpy man. The two begin their real estate business after purchasing a luxury complex building with money they don’t even have, with the help of mortgage broker Nicole (Janaina Uhse), who Viktor marries later on.  
Their plan consists of scamming people into bankruptcy by giving them fake bank loans to buy properties when the payments are actually going to Viktor and Gerry. After the first successful attempt, things escalate quickly. Between a repetitive amount of party scenes and bureaucratic meetings, the setbacks of the scams were also weak. To illustrate, at one point Viktor had to create his own bank in a foreign country because he couldn’t enlist the help of the German ones anymore — problem solved, just like that. 
The fraudulent scams were generally well planned, but that’s to credit the writers and producers. However, it seems that most of the writers’ efforts went into developing these crimes and not the characters’ personalities. In the end, this imbalanced writing failed to create a truly convincing story. It is hard to believe that Viktor, a tame blonde with no real guts, could effectively convince so many individuals and even entire firms into signing million-dollar contracts, as clueless as they could have been. 
Predictably, however, he doesn’t get away with it. The movie is nonlinear and contains three main time frames: the time of the scams, the flashbacks to Viktor’s childhood and his time in prison, where he tells the whole story to a journalist. Even in prison, he doesn’t express any remorse about his crimes — tax evasion, money laundering, fraud — and he explicitly says so. The problem is that it is really hard to buy his maliciousness; it is simply not convincing. 
Yet, there is one personality twist toward the end that is slightly more authentic, in which Viktor genuinely makes an effort to reconnect with his now ex-wife and daughter, whom he has had almost no contact with. That glimpse of improvement, however, doesn’t hold up. After his emotional family reunion, it’s not certain whether or not he will return to a criminal life — but that is made clear in the end.
With that, it is clear that the movie is, overall, savorless. The plot has potential, but it is also somewhat predictable. The failed attempt to add a bit of comedy to it is almost pathetic. The obvious way in which Viktor enjoys his life when he rises to the top — with a beautiful mansion, parties full of drugs, an expensive car and bags full of dollar bills — is also disappointing.
“Betonrausch” is actually an engaging film and easy to watch, and the seductiveness of the wealthy lifestyle is also appealing.  But we have seen it all before. It is supposed to be one of those movies that viewers root for the antiheroes in the white collars, even when they are scammers; viewers like to watch the crooks’ extravagant and luxurious lives, carried by their arrogant personas, but that doesn’t happen in this case. 
Despite its name, “Betonrausch” doesn’t provide much adrenaline nor excitement; it doesn’t build up to any tension, and the viewer is most likely to predict the end. It’s a classic case of “been there, done that.” But not only was it cliche, it simply wasn’t convincing enough.

Parents in the college admissions scandal submitted a reply in court Friday asking that the case or evidentiary phone call recordings be thrown out in light of the prosecution’s alleged misconduct.
In the reply, the defense argued that recordings of phone calls between scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer and the parents could not be used as evidence in the case, as Singer testified that prosecutors had told him to extract false statements from the parents on the calls.
“The Government now admits that ‘most of the defendants understood their money to be going to designated programs,’” the reply read. “But if Singer’s allegations are true, then (1) the calls have no evidentiary value, and (2) the Government engaged in the worst kind of official misconduct imaginable: fabricating evidence to secure a wrongful conviction.”
According to a memorandum filed Friday by Nathaniel Gorton, one of the federal judges overseeing the case, the government responded to Singer’s allegations of eliciting false testimony by stating that the claims did not merit an investigation.
“The Court considers the allegations … to be serious and disturbing,” the memorandum read. “While government agents are permitted to coach cooperating witnesses during the course of an investigation, they are not permitted to suborn the commission of a crime.”
The reply also cited an email from Singer to one of the parents claiming the side door method was an acceptable and recognized way to gain admission to a university. According to the defense, the government knew before Singer’s wiretapped calls with the parents that Singer had told them their payments were legitimate donations rather than bribes but told Singer to lie about the misrepresentation.
“When Singer told the Government that he had informed Defendants that the payments were donations, not bribes, he was telling the Government that he had informed them that the payments were legitimate,” the reply read.
The defense argued that the government’s failure to submit proof that Singer’s claims were false suggests the allegations of coercion are true.
“If the Government had any evidence to support its denials, it presumably would have filed it with its brief (as Defendants did),” the reply read. “Its utter failure to introduce anything from any of the relevant participants (all of whom are under Government control) speaks volumes.”
Fourteen parents, including 11 with USC connections, have opted to plead not guilty and fight charges in the Operation Varsity Blues case. They will stand trial in Boston federal court in two groups beginning Oct. 5.

The acute stress of standardized testing is a feeling all too familiar for college students. Only a few years ago, USC students were high schoolers studying for the ACT and SAT with mounting pressure. One early morning in a crowded testing center, they each took the test that no doubt played a role in determining their future and acceptance into USC.  
Already stressful and drawn out as it is, the coronavirus pandemic managed to transform standardized testing into an even more anxiety-inducing process. Due to current restrictions and regulations, the College Board cannot allow testing to take place in May and June, and it’s uncertain when in person tests will be offered again.  Because of this, USC should drop the SAT and ACT requirement for Fall 2021 applicants. 
Many students use their junior year to take the SAT or ACT,  but due to the closures caused by the coronavirus, an estimated 1 million high school juniors are unable to take the exams as planned. With a future extremely uncertain and testing centers not reopening until after June, it is unfair to expect students to be able to take the test, let alone score as highly as they could under normal circumstances. 
More than 50 universities have already dropped these standardized test application requirements for the next admissions cycle, including Boston University, all University of California campuses and California State University campuses, University of Washington and Tulane University.  
College Board CEO David Coleman said that if schools do not return this fall, the SAT would be converted to something that could be taken at home, and a spokesperson for the ACT said the company would also be prepared to move digital for at-home testing. However, not all students have access to quiet spaces in their homes or adequate technology. 
This possible at-home solution would only exacerbate existing inequalities in standardized testing. Universities such as USC can avoid these inevitable inequalities by simply not requiring students to submit standardized test scores with their applications. 
Although the debate surrounding standardized testing has ramped up in recent years, a suspension of SAT and ACT scores for those entering college in Fall 2021 does not mean universities have to do away with testing forever. It could, however, provide USC with an opportunity to see what admissions could look like without the requirement of a test with results largely contingent on socioeconomic status. 
After a company falsified test scores and gave other students unneeded extended time during the Varsity Blues scandal that surfaced March 2019, changing testing requirements for Fall 2021 also acts as a forced trial run of what the future of college admissions should look like in avoiding the potential for these practices. Standardized testing results oftentimes reflect expensive personal tutors and prep classes a family can afford to buy, rather than solely the student’s aptitude. Therefore, a year without standardized testing requirements is not only necessary during this time but also offers a great chance for schools to reinvent their admissions criteria and processes.
Many students take the tests multiple times to improve upon past scores and receive the best possible mark they can. This upcoming year, for merit scholarship consideration, the USC application deadline is Dec. 1, for the regular first-year application, the deadline is Jan. 15. These early deadlines combined with the cancellations caused by the pandemic give current juniors a narrow window to earn the score they are striving for  before they must submit them with their applications. Again, it is not even guaranteed in-person testing will open once again in the fall making the uncertainty of this application cycle only stronger. 
The decision about testing requirements is one the University must resolve now. By waiting out the situation and delaying a decision, USC increases anxiety for current high school students who are already dealing with an extremely uncertain future. 
Given that standardized testing has already been canceled for May and June, USC should follow countless other schools and make standardized testing optional. In a time of complete chaos and change, ending the requirements for the SAT and ACT for the next admissions cycle gives high schoolers one fewer thing to worry about.

Millennial humor both confuses and delights. The contextless, post-modern inclinations of so-called “shitposting,” the satirical ennui of post-irony and the borderline absurdist and slightly vicious fatalism of modern humor reflect the often bleak sociopolitical atmosphere in which millennials grew up. 
Anyone with an internet connection has probably seen the ease and flippancy with which younger generations threaten suicide as a throw-away punchline. Viral outrage in 2018 drew a clear line between younger generations sarcastically thinking about consuming Tide Pods and horrified and oblivious older generations who thought their grandchildren had resorted to eating these supersized, detergent filled Fruit Gushers for attention.
Call it sarcasm, satire, absurdism, irony, gallows humor, black comedy or dark humor: Fatalistic millennial humor is all of this, everything in between and a little extra thrown in like cilantro to delight or disgust you, depending on your taste. 
For a generation who grew up with 9/11, constant war in the Middle East, increasing gun violence, growing class divides, multiple economic crises and accelerating climate change — all inconveniently blasted to our handheld mobile devices 24/7 — it’s no surprise that humor now tastes like death.
In an interview with NBC News, Shane Tilton, an assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Ohio Northern University, describes how this fatalistic humor acts as a coping mechanism. He suggests that “Gen Z and millennials don’t have the ability to control the economy, but by goodness they can put text on a gif and say something about the situation.”
According to Tilton, the memes that leave older generations so perplexed provide millennials with a simple and effective means to express stress and regain control. These communal memes are one step up from just screaming into the void. Online, the void actually screams back through likes and retweets.
Before any older readers try to crucify millennials and their vaguely sadistic sense of humor, consider that it’s nothing new. Recall that millennial “shitposting,” dubbed neo-dadaism, takes its cues from the early 20th-century avant-garde movement that rejected meaning and embraced irrationality. Moreover, Tilton suggests an analogy with the Great Depression when popular entertainers like Will Rogers used satire to cope with harsh economic realities.
But not everyone agrees that dark humor is appropriate. Online discourse reaches a boiling point at the intersection of dark humor and mental health. How could it not? The very core of this brand of humor is a rejection of mortality, a deadpan (pun intended) embrace of sweet, sweet death. 
For many people, fatalistic humor offers a coping mechanism to express complex and difficult topics, but for many others, these jokes seem to trivialize serious and sensitive topics — topics that can literally be life or death. So is laughter the best medicine? 
In a word, yes. Well, maybe not the best, but definitely up there with NyQuil and penicillin.
According to Psychology Today, finding humor in stressful situations reduces the physiological stress response, lessens emotional distress and decreases negative emotions. Black humor, in particular, offers a mechanism to examine and reconsider negative experiences from a less threatening point of view, an emotion regulation strategy known as cognitive reappraisal. 
This isn’t to say that the feelings of those who take offense to dark humor aren’t valid. A joke can simultaneously offer a positive coping mechanism and means of communication for one person while also making another person feel trivialized or triggered. It’s never a zero-sum game. They say good comedians punch up, not down. I’ll say good fatalistic comedians can punch down but only on themselves.
But sometimes jokes do fall flat. Consider that fatalistic humor operates like self-deprecation on a large scale. At times, it becomes a crutch, an entertaining and paradoxically lighthearted way to avoid heavy issues and difficult conversations. Just as ghoulish humor can provide an opportunity to discuss sensitive topics and feelings, these same jokes can act as a defense mechanism to avoid confronting negative emotions and situations.
Ultimately, the consensus is out on fatalistic humor. To some, it’s the height of comedy. To others, it’s confusing at best and offensive at worst. People can use this humor equally as a valid coping mechanism or emotion regulation strategy and as a distraction to avoid their problems. 
At the end of the day — or in this case, the end of the world — here’s a toast to the weird, wacky and incredibly online humor of millennials and Gen-Z. So, raise your glass of Tide Pods and scare your aunt on Facebook with your deliciously dark humor.
