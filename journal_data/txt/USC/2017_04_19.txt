President Donald Trump’s entrance into the political sphere not only disrupted the long run of traditional politicians as candidates, but also introduced a new quarrel with what some refer to as the fourth branch of government: the press.
On Wednesday night in Bovard Auditorium, the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy hosted the Holt Lecture, a speaker series devoted to communications and politics. The lecture series was established by Price School board of councilors member Dennis Holt, and his wife Brooks Holt.
This year’s Holt Lecture, titled “Journalism, Accountability, Power,” featured Frederick J. Ryan Jr., publisher and CEO of The Washington Post. Ryan previously served as the president and COO of Allbritton Communications Company and founding CEO and president of POLITICO. Previously, he was the chief of staff for former President Ronald Reagan. He is also a USC alumnus and serves on the USC Board of Trustees.
Ryan was introduced by Jack Knott, dean of the Price School. Knott commented on the timeliness of Ryan’s talk and the importance of trustworthy journalism in the present time.
“We are in an era of significant challenges in democratic governance and a growing, unprecedented level of distrust in democratic institutions,” Knott said. “Nowhere is this distrust more manifest than in the relation between the news media, journalism and the government.”
According to Knott, people’s trust in the media has never been lower, and Trump is part of the problem.
“Political narratives increasingly rely on perceived reality instead of analytic methods, evidence and facts,” Knott said. “President Trump has brought the idea of fake news and alternative facts into our everyday vocabulary.”
Ryan began his talk by centering around his work at The Washington Post. Ryan is to thank for the The Washington Post’s transition into the digital world from its traditionally print publication.
“When I started two-and-a-half years ago in this position as publisher of The Washington Post, some people looked at me like I was crazy,” Ryan said. “They asked me, ‘Why would you join a print legacy news organization at a time where the business model is failing?’”
Ryan used his new position at The Washington Post to compartmentalize the staff, hire new engineers and increase the number of platforms the newspaper utilizes.
“We established a very aggressive strategy of embracing both established and emerging social media platforms,” Ryan said. “Rather than being platform-agnostic, we are platform-specific, with specialists producing stories for each social media platform.”
Under Ryan’s supervision, The Washington Post has expanded to platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat, which Ryan notes has expanded their readership and extended their audience to a younger demographic.
Ryan also touched on the danger of fake news, especially in the rapidly changing digital sphere.
“It’s wrong to inflate unfavorable news to fake news,” Ryan said. “Applying the fake news label is an attack on the truth. It’s reckless and corrosive to democracy, and elected officials attempt to deliberately and systematically erode the credibility of news organizations because they object to factually accurate reporting.”
According to Ryan, conflict between the White House and the media is not unique to the Trump administration. Nevertheless, Ryan notes, there is a particularly contentious relationship between Trump and the press.
Ryan believes that Trump’s war with the press has stemmed from a different type of coverage.
“Over the years, he has very effectively engaged with the press to promote his business ventures,” Ryan said. “But that coverage was essentially publicity. He views the press as a tool to publicize his business and personal image. Today, on the presidential stage, he faces a different type of media reporting: accountability.”
Raphael Bostic, the moderator of the event and chair of the Department of Governance, Management and the Policy Process at the Price School, asked Ryan what consumers can do to recognize and avoid fake news. Ryan said readers should be looking at multiple news sources, not just ones they agree with.
“There are business models in media that appeal to one particular ideology or the other,” Ryan said. “I advise readers to go to a variety of news sources. I try to go to ones that I know are objective, and I go to ones that I know have a particular view. Just so you can have a better understanding and broader perspective of opinions. The more the better. We have to be very skeptical.” 
This is rich coming from the institution that gave us Janet Cooke, the Pulitzer Prize paragon of fake news!
And fake news isn’t ” an attack on the truth “

The Academic Senate voted in favor of instituting a two-day break in the eighth week of the fall semester on Wednesday. 
The resolution will now be presented to President C. L.  Max Nikias, Provost Michael Quick, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Director of Campus Activities Gabriel Valenzuela. There is still no set time when this fall break could be integrated into the USC academic calendar. 
According to the former Undergraduate Student Government President Edwin Saucedo, efforts to pass the resolution have been underway for several months. He said the passing of the resolution through the Academic Senate was the culmination of the work of many previous USG leaders who had also attempted to institute the break. 
“This is a resolution that has gone through our student government for the last three or four years, so it’s something that’s been in the works since I remember arriving at USC,” Saucedo said. “Without the professors and the Academic Senate on board, this is not a possibility because the fall break does not just affect students, but professors teaching the students as well.” 
In the period between Labor Day and Thanksgiving break, USC students have 56 consecutive instructional days, one of the longest among elite universities. The extended educational period has inflicted undue stress and anxiety on students. 
“We were looking at the fact that USC is a top 25 school with a semester system, and it has the longest academic semester,” Saucedo said. 
“Looking at the state of mental health on our campus, a lot of students struggle with stress and being able to juggle school and a social life and work and career opportunities. We wanted to model after the spring semester where we have continuous breaks.” 
USG worked in conjunction with the Engemann Student Health Center to gather data on students. Counseling Services reported that appointments at the health center reach a semester-high between weeks 10 and 12, which does not align with the Center for Disease Control’s reported flu season. 
“We’re looking at when are students the most stressed and frequenting the Health Center the most,” Saucedo said. “We saw a spike up in the eighth through 10th weeks. Choosing the eighth week allowed us to be proactive as opposed to reactive. Having a break in the 10th or 11th week might be too late to really solve the issue that we’re trying to get at.” 
Saucedo credited the approval to the increased awareness of the importance of mental health on campus and greater conversation surrounding students’ well-being. 
“Over the last couple of years, the conversation around mental health on campus has really changed,” Saucedo said. “Ideally, we want to continue providing more resources for our students. It’s OK to be stressed but also OK to ask for help.”

When it comes to shopping for fresh and healthy foods, many USC students and community members struggle to find healthy, accessible, inexpensive options in University Park Campus and the surrounding neighborhoods of South Los Angeles.
Figueroa Street features numerous fast-food restaurants but lacks grocery stores and healthier options — a problem that the USC Undergraduate Student Government aims to address with a new proposal for a weekly farmers market in the USC Village.
According to Alec Vandenberg, the assistant director of community affairs for USG and a writer for the Daily Trojan, a third of the University Park community faces poverty, and obesity is a growing concern for the children growing up in South Los Angeles. There are currently no local farmers markets in immediate proximity to University Park, and the closest farmers market, the Blue Line Farmers’ Market in Compton, was recently discontinued.
If the proposal works out, the new farmers market will provide fresh, in-season produce from local vendors and farmers. There will also be a strong focus on bringing in vendors who sell healthy, organic fruits and vegetables, not just arts and crafts.
“The focus of the market will be on healthy foods,” said USG director of community affairs Mai Mizuno. “This market is for a larger demographic. It will be a hub for community members.” 
USG wants to increase accessibility and affordability for students and members of the local community who want to shop for local groceries and fresh produce.
Although USC currently has the Trojan Farmers Market, a weekly on-campus farmers market held on Wednesdays in McCarthy Quad, Mizuno noted that many students on campus have complained about the lack of fresh, affordable produce.
According to Mizuno, the Trojan Farmers Market, run by USC Hospitality, caters toward students that can afford the crafts and organic products sold by the vendors, but other members of the community are left out.
“The goal is not to replace the current markets that we have,” Mizuno said. “The goal is to supplement it and market it toward a different audience.” 
One notable difference is that the new farmers market would be student-run and would not only target USC students, but also residents of  the surrounding University Park Campus area. It will be open on Saturdays to make it easier for students and community members to come out and shop.
“We don’t want it to be at a time when parents are working and kids are in school,” Mizuno said. 
USG is also working on getting farmers market vendors who accept CALFRESH food vouchers and EBT cards on board.
USG worked with Helen Lee, the manager of multiple California Certified Farmers Markets in the Los Angeles area including the one held weekly on the Health Sciences Campus, in developing the proposal.
Although specialty market Trader Joe’s will be opening its first downtown location at the USC Village in 2017, Vandenberg doesn’t feel that it will be a threat to business. He hopes that holding the market on a Saturday will  accommodate not only USC students, but also parents picking up their children at the 32nd Street School next to the USC Village.
“A lot of times, people won’t necessarily take the Metro to a Trader Joe’s, but they will take the Metro to a farmers market,” Vandenberg said. “Oftentimes, it is cheaper, it’s more accessible, you have more options and it’s locally grown.” 
Prior to the Trojan Farmers Market becoming a weekly event in 2013, University Park had a local farmers market at the Shrine Auditorium. It was later moved to a space on University Avenue because of steep rental costs from the Shrine, but it was discontinued when the old University Village was torn down.
USG is currently working to partner with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to subsidize the market and offer exclusive discounts to Metro riders through its Destination Discounts program. By showing a Metro TAP Card, Metro riders would be able to receive a 10 percent discount on purchases made at the market.
Metro would also be able to advertise the USC Village farmers market on its website and invite tourists and visitors from other neighboring cities to make a stop at the market.
“The administration has really marketed the [USC] Village as this conduit between USC students and the local community, so we thought that it would be a perfect opportunity to bring a community farmers market and to really hit on that fresh produce,” Mizuno said.
Clarification: The previous headline for this article “USC Village to host farmers market” was misleading. The article has now been updated to reflect that the farmers market is in the proposal process.
Why is there no mention of the Farmer’s market nearby which already exists?

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism was ranked No. 1 in the world for communication and media studies in the 2017 QS World University Rankings by Subject. This is the third straight year USC has held the top spot in this category.
The QS subject rankings have been published annually since 2011, and this year’s list features rankings in 46 fields, its largest and most comprehensive list to date. 
The rankings’ purpose is to assist students and scholars in discovering the best universities in each subject area.
Other universities in the top five for communication and media studies include the University of Amsterdam, the London School of Economics and Political Science, Stanford University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
A university’s ranking is determined by several performance indicators, including academic reputation, citations per published paper, employer reputation and H-index score, which measures the productivity and impact of papers.
Surveys sent to over 70,000 academics around the world contribute to the academic reputation score, which measures universities’ quality of research in multiple subjects and overall prestige. Over 35,000 employers provide feedback regarding the domestic and international universities and specific fields of study from which they prefer to recruit.
The indicators are weighted differently between subject rankings to correspond with the level of research involved in each area. For the communications and media studies category, a school’s academic reputation accounts for 50 percent of the total score, while employer reputation, citations per paper and H-index measure comprise 10 percent, 20 percent and 20 percent of the ranking, respectively.

Coming off a solid road victory up at Stanford on Tuesday, the No. 1 USC beach volleyball team (26-0) is back home and ready to wrap up the regular season as it hosts a pair of California teams for two dual matches on Thursday afternoon. The Trojans will put their 56-match winning streak on the line when they welcome No. 5 Long Beach State and Cal State Bakersfield to the friendly confines of Merle Norman Stadium, where USC has won its last 12 straight matches. Furthermore, the Trojans will look to win their 88th dual in their last 90 tries.
Senior All-Americans Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes, the first pair in NCAA history to reach 100 wins together (123-4 overall, .968), headline the current undefeated Trojan squad at the top court after setting a national record with 103 consecutive victories from April 2, 2015 to April 8, 2017. 
The two veterans have the benefit of experience on their side, having played together at court one since their sophomore years. However, the other four USC pairs have all had to adjust to new partners in 2017, with 14 different lineup changes being used throughout the season due to various injuries. But with a team as deep as USC’s, Hughes knows how big of a luxury it is to have players on the roster that can come in and step up when called upon.
“I’m not surprised at how well our team has adjusted,” Hughes said. “I think that’s a big thing for us this year — we have depth from top to bottom, from our ones to our fives and even our exhibition pairs. People are working really hard in practice and pushing each other to get better, and that has been great for us as a whole.”
The Trojan depth has been on full display so far this season despite the lineup changes, with three different USC pairs notching at least 20 wins this season. One of those successful pairs is the tandem of juniors Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer at the No. 5 spot. With a 28-3 overall mark together on the season and a 24-1 record in dual matches, Belton and Kremer will look to extend their own winning streak to 10 consecutive matches with two wins on Thursday. Finally, the No. 3 pair of junior Terese Cannon and senior Nicolette Martin have posted 24 overall wins (seven losses) with 21 of those coming in dual play. In total, six pairs have recorded at least 11 wins overall this season.

The No. 32 women’s tennis team fell to No. 13 Pepperdine 4-3 in a match that lasted over four hours at Marks Stadium. The loss marks USC’s ninth loss of the season and brings their overall record to 10-9 as they begin to look toward postseason competition.
Doubles play kicked off what would be a long afternoon with Pepperdine nabbing the first win of the day. The No. 6 duo of Christine Maddox and Mayar Sherif beat the Trojans’ sophomore Jessica Failla and sophomore Rianna Valdes by a 6-3 overall score. The Trojans were not deterred as the No. 9 duo of freshman Angela Kulikov and junior Madison Westby defeated Dzina Milovanovic and her partner Apichaya Rungledkriangkrai by a score of 6-3. USC extended their winning streak to nab the first point of the afternoon when No. 37 senior Zoë Katz and junior Gabby Smith edged out Luisa Stefani and Ashley Lahey, 7-6 (6). 
USC went into singles matchups with a 1-0 advantage, but the tide soon turned. No. 35 Mayar Sherif defeated Rianna Valdes 6-4, 6-4 to tie the game. The Waves added another point when No. 12 Luisa Smith took down Gabby Smith 6-1, 7-6 (5). 
Facing a 2-1 deficit late into the afternoon, Failla brought back hope for the Trojans when she upset No. 13 Ashley Lahey 6-4, 6-4. However, even with such an upset Pepperdine did not step down as Dzina Milovanovic took down freshman Angela Kulikov 7-6 (5), 6-4. 
With 1 point left to clinch the game the Waves were hoping to end things early against the Trojans. Apichaya Rungledkraingkrai defeated Westby 6-4 to put things in favor of the Waves. However, Westby soon fought back to win the next two sets 6-2, 7-5 to tie the game at 3-3.
USC’s No. 121 Katz faced off against No. 90 Laura Gulbe in the final singles matchup of the afternoon, and started out strong. After winning the first set 7-6 (9), Gulbe fought back and win out 6-3, 6-3 to lead the Waves over the Trojans 4-3. 
The Trojans will now head to Westwood where they will face off against crosstown rival No. 22 UCLA on Saturday at noon. After Saturday’s game, the Trojans will look toward the Pac-12 team championships in Ojai on April 27.
It is definitely time for Coach Gallien to move on from USC. The fact that Pepperdine could be ranked
13th while the Trojans are 32nd says it all. The main problem is who will Swann hire since he has no
experience in this area. The way he is going after a Women Basketball coach is a disaster in itself.

The Trojans swept the Pac-12 Field Athlete of the Week awards this week, taking home the honors for both male and female athletes.
It was the second consecutive honor for redshirt junior Eric Sloan, who took home men’s field Athlete of the Week for his victory in the triple jump at last weekend’s Beach Invitational in Long Beach. In order to notch the win, Sloan beat out an Olympian and a former U.S. triple jump champion with a 16.42m finish in the event. 
The jump was more than two feet longer than any Pac-12 finish this season, and placed Sloan second among all NCAA athletes for this season. He now holds the top distances for the long jump and the triple jump for the Pac-12 this season.
Sophomore Margaux Jones finished first among the collegiate athletes at the Beach Invitational, placing third overall in the long jump. Her finish of 6.31m was a season-best and also set a new record for the Pac-12 this season. She finished behind two non-collegiate competitors — a 2015 Pan American Games gold medalist and a former Pac-12 champion.
The Trojans now have seven Pac-12 weekly awards under their belts for the track and field season. Other winners include redshirt junior Nick Ponzio, junior Deanna Hill, redshirt senior Just’N Thymes and junior Kendall Ellis. 
Next up, the Trojans head to San Diego for the Triton Invitational at UCSD. The men’s team is now ranked No. 11 in the country, while the women’s team is staying steady in their slot at No. 5.

Terry Nguyen | Daily Trojan
Next Thursday will mark the start of a new journey for a group of Trojans entering the NFL Draft. One headliner for USC is JuJu Smith-Schuster, the former wide receiver who led last year’s team in receiving yards.
Although Smith-Schuster was a leader for the Trojans, he isn’t a frontrunner for this year’s draft -— he is predicted to be selected in the second or third round. In preparation for the big day, he took matters into his own hands, writing a resume and cover letter for The Players Tribune explaining why he thinks he’s the right man for the job for any NFL team.
“While size, speed, athleticism are important, I know you’re looking for more,” Smith-Schuster wrote. “You’re looking for something that can’t be measured at the combine and won’t show up on film. You’re looking for two things: a guy who loves to compete and who loves the game of football.”
His cover letter focused on these characteristics, rather than his 3,092 career yards or his 25 career touchdowns. Instead, he wrote about his passion for the game and for competing to become the best.
To highlight the strength of his conviction, Smith-Schuster retold the story of the 2015 game against Arizona. Despite breaking his hand the week before, he went on to haul in eight catches for 138 yards, scoring a touchdown for the Trojans despite the metal plate placed in his hand.
“You’re looking for the guy who wants it more,” Smith-Schuster said. “If you draft me, I’ll come in and compete every single day. I’ve worked my whole life for this. Now I’m ready to work harder than I’ve ever worked before. And I’m ready to win. For you.”

The No. 6 ranked Trojans will face crosstown rival No. 8 UCLA once more, this time for the Pac-12 regular season championship on Friday on the road in Westwood. 
The winner of the regular season title game will receive the top seeding for the upcoming Pac-12 Championships which will kick off on April 26 at Libbey Park in Ojai, Calif. After an early ending to last year’s postseason run, the Trojans look to give themselves the best possible position to start this season’s conference and national tournaments.
In two matches against the Bruins this season, the Trojans have split a win and a loss. In the opening round of the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in February, the Trojans lost 4-3. Just a few weeks later, the Trojans earned a win at home via a score of 4-1. Both meetings between the two rivals have been in nonconference play, and the stakes will be much higher in this matchup.
Both the Trojans and Bruins are each fresh off a set of wins heading into Friday’s matchup. Last week the Trojans beat Arizona and Utah 4-0 and 7-0, respectively, as did the Bruins, 4-0 and 4-2.  The Trojans’ Friday matchup is their only match of the week, while the Bruins play Cal Lutheran on Wednesday in nonconference play.
Heading into Friday’s Pac-12 clash, both USC and UCLA have players ranked in the Oracle/ITA Rankings. Freshman Brandon Holt stands as the highest ranked Trojan with a No. 22 ranking while Logan Smith tops off the singles charts with an overall No. 79 ranking. 
As for doubles, freshman duo Holt and his partner Riley Smith made their way into the top 10 this week with an overall No. 10 ranking, while senior Nick Crystal and his partner sophomore Laurens Verboven hold their ranking at No. 85.
As for the Bruins, Gage Brymer clocks in at No. 21 in singles while Martin Redlicki tops off the Bruins at No. 57. In doubles, Redlicki and Evan Zhu are the only ranked Bruins in doubles play with an overall No. 12 ranking. 
As the regular season comes to a close, the Trojans have claimed their 10th 20-win season in the past 11 years and USC head coach Peter Smith earned his 600th career win at the end of March. With five national championships in the last eight years, Smith’s Trojans hope to use the momentum from their historic season into a deep run not only in the Pac-12 championships, but also the NCAA playoffs. 
The Trojans, who were knocked out unexpectedly in the Round of 16 last year, have already built upon their 2016 record of 17-4. Having only lost one senior and gained two strong freshmen, the Trojans are filled with veteran talent and have their sights set on championship number six. The road to that title begins for the Trojans on Friday.

It may be long past March, but on Tuesday, the craziest Cinderella run in sports came to an end. Across the pond, English soccer club Leicester City hosted Spanish outfit Atlético Madrid in the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League, and the two teams played to a 1-1 draw, which knocked Leicester out of the most prestigious soccer competition on the planet not named the World Cup (Madrid had won the first leg of the tie, 1-0).
Oh, right. Leicester. They’re still around? The Foxes’ miraculous run to the 2015-2016 English Premier League title against 5,000-to-1 preseason odds made headlines in the United States last year, but their follow-up campaign has received far less coverage. Not that it matters anymore, as Leicester has been knocked out of all its cup competitions and currently sits 12th in the Premier League table.
But at the conclusion of this wild two-year journey, I want to look back and appreciate the magnitude of the Leicester City story. American sports fans are among the most passionate and obsessed in the world, and it would be a shame if we didn’t take the time to soak in what may truly be the most unlikely series of events in modern athletics — at least at a purely competitive level.
Think about this: When Leicester faced off against Manchester City (owned by billionaire United Arab Emirates deputy prime minister Sheikh Mansour) in 2015, the Foxes’ lineup cost a whopping £270 million less to assemble than their opponent’s. And we aren’t even talking payroll here — that number accounts for transfer fees alone, which simply grant clubs the right to negotiate a contract with a player from a different team.
Leicester received a gargantuan influx of cash upon winning the Premier League title last year (estimated north of £100 million in prize money and revenue sharing), but even with that extra income and subsequent spending, the Foxes committed a club-record transfer fee of £29 million last summer for Algerian forward Islam Slimani — a figure City has surpassed six times in the past five years. Another English titan, Manchester United, smashed the world record in August, purchasing midfielder Paul Pogba for nearly £90 million.
That should give you an idea of the competitive imbalance in professional European soccer and the insurmountable disadvantage Leicester somehow overcame to win the Premiere League. And this was just two years after the team earned promotion from the Football League Championship: England’s second tier. Leicester narrowly avoided relegation during its first top-flight season, sitting in dead last for 140 days before pulling itself out of the bottom three during the season’s final weeks. Many considered it one of the most miraculous escapes in league history. One year later, the Foxes lifted the Premier League trophy.
But the miraculous title run somehow may not be the most compelling part of the story. There’s a reason a Leicester City movie is already in the works from The Fighter screenwriters Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson. The film will focus on the Foxes’ most emblematic player: Jamie Vardy. The 30-year-old striker has been at Leicester since the club’s Championship days, and his rags-to-riches story propelled the Foxes throughout their unlikely campaign. 
In 2004, Vardy was playing non-league soccer (below England’s top four divisions) with Stocksbridge Park Steels while also working part-time in a factory as a carbon-fiber technician. While at Stocksbridge, Vardy was convicted of assault when two men mocked his friend for wearing a hearing aid, and Vardy played with an electronic tag for six months, needing to get subbed off early during away games to make it home in time for his court-mandated curfew. Nearly a decade later, he set a new Premier League record, scoring in 11 consecutive matches during Leicester’s title-winning run, and turned down a move to Arsenal, one of England’s most prestigious clubs. Throughout all this, he retained his blue-collar persona, crushing Red Bulls and playing games with nicotine patches, snuff and nicotine gum.
And Vardy is just one man on a roster chock-full of unconventional journeys to soccer’s pinnacle. Leicester captain Wes Morgan recorded more than 400 appearances in second-division soccer before becoming the third field player ever to play every minute of a Premier League-winning season — earning a Team of the Year honor in the process. This year, he also became the first Jamaican in history to score a goal in the Champions League. Two of the 2015-2016 season’s biggest stars, N’Golo Kanté and Riyad Mahrez, had spent their entire careers in the French lower divisions before joining the Foxes, and they were named alongside Morgan in last season’s Team of the Year (Kanté has since secured a £29 million move to Chelsea, who currently lead the Premier League).
Somehow, this group summited arguably the toughest domestic league in the world. And this season, after a knee-jerk firing of manager Claudio Ranieri when Leicester stumbled out of the gates, the club made a run to the Champions League quarterfinal: a stage European soccer giants such as Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham and Paris Saint Germain and their bottomless coffers failed to reach. The ultimate fairytale may not have come true, but the club’s achievements aren’t impressive — they’re unfathomable. Let’s soak it all in one last time before the miracle inevitably fades from our short memories.
We may never hear of Leicester City again … until its movie overcomes 5,000-to-1 odds to take home Best Picture at the 2020 Academy Awards.

Coachella attracts several huge names every year, with masses flocking to Indio, Calif. to hear Kendrick Lamar or Lady Gaga and holding onto high hopes for a Drake appearance. Those who pride themselves for their musical knowledge beyond the Billboard-charting artists may even name Empire of the Sun, Bon Iver and Glass Animals as acts they hope to see . However, the real music connoisseurs are those who recognize the names that line the bottom of the Coachella poster. Though they have not fully captured the attention of mainstream music fans, these artists create the dynamic essence of Coachella’s music atmosphere. 
 Jack Garratt
His soulful voice is sure to pierce through the massive crowds. Having supported Mumford & Sons on tour, Garratt has a dedicated fanbase and will only continue to increase in popularity. His first album Phase contains a mix of slower ballads as well as experimental electronic-inspired tracks. The dynamic music style Garratt brings to the stage is sure to impress Coachella fans who are looking for an unpredictable artist. 
Zipper Club
Bringing together Mason James of Cerebral Ballzy and Lissy Trullie, this duo is uninhibited and unafraid. Upbeat, playful and synthetic-heavy, Zipper Club hops across genres and instruments to create an incredibly unique sound. “If it sounds good I don’t care if it’s from the 1920s or the 2016s,” their website reads. With a bright future ahead of them, Zipper Club’s Coachella performance is the perfect time to interact with current fans and attract new ones.
BROODS
Opening for fellow Coachella performers Empire of the Sun and Two Door Cinema Club, this New Zealand brother-sister duo has established themselves as a force to be reckoned with. BROODS draws similarities to artists such as Lorde and HAIM; lead vocalist Georgia Nott’s haunting voice establishes her a niche in the indie-pop genre. Her voice is soft, sweet and airy with a heightened element of mystery. The second member of the duo, multi-instrumentalist Caleb Nott supplements Georgia Nott’s talent with his production talent and backing vocals. 
The Avalanches
For those music festival goers who are nostalgic for the psychedelic era of concerts, head over to the set of Australian DJ group The Avalanches. Inheriting the ’70s punk scene while infusing it with rap, The Avalanches’ sound is the epitome of sensory overload. The group creates sample-heavy music, taking fragmented pieces of songs and sound and implementing unique parts into tracks. Their latest album, Wildflower, carries a carefree, hippie-like sound that portrays the duality of human emotion through a mix of joyful beats and sorrowful melodies. 
Devendra Banhart
This bearded, acoustic lyrical genius can be considered a reincarnation of Jack Johnson. His laidback, summer ballads are distinct from the flashy, stunt heavy performers that take the same stage, but that’s exactly the beauty of Banhart at Coachella. His set will provide a much-needed break come Sunday evening, and audiences can bask in the desert sun, enjoying the gentle guitar and celebrating the illusion of summer that he conjures. 
 The Lemon Twigs
From the looks of The Lemon Twigs, it appears as if the band has stepped right out of the ’60s and into Indio. Brothers Brian and Michael D’Addario are teenagers with strong, memorable vocals wthat are reminiscent of the Beatles. The Lemon Twigs’
synthetic-filled tracks share similar vibes with the punk-rock band Ramones, while holding onto a Broadway-like theatricality in performance. The band is a modern-day take on a combination of a variety of musical genres: from soft rock to underground cool to musical theater songs. Regardless of song style, the members’ voices blend harmoniously within every track, creating a complementary balance to background beats.
Joel Little was lordes producer and is part of the broads writing team. Lorde co wrote Heartlines for Broods

Readers of this column may recognize that versatility is at the heart of most successful musicians’ career planning. Senior Emma Reinhart knows that too. But she considers her diverse musical skillset more than just a survival strategy. For the saxophonist, the eclecticism of music is what makes it interesting.
Reinhart entered USC as a music major on a pre-pharmacy track, but a transformative summer program at Disney convinced her to focus solely on music.
“The summer after sophomore year, I was accepted to the All-American College Band at Disneyland, and that really opened my eyes [as] to how many career paths there are within music,” Reinhart said. “[After] coming back to school, I dropped my pre-pharmacy stuff and went all out for music.”
Many of the clinicians who visited the Disney band were musicians who had made their careers as producers, business specialists or film consultants. Reinhart told me she hadn’t considered that music offered so many opportunities beyond performing. That fall, she added a music industry minor to her degree in classical saxophone. She began to take any jazz class she could fit around her minor and her work as a music educator. And since then, she hasn’t looked back.
“There’s a whole other side to what you can do, outside of playing your instrument, that opens so many doors,” Reinhart said.
For example, Reinhart told me teaching music through the Thornton Community Engagement Project, the music school’s outreach initiative, has given her perspective on the value music can have for young people.
In an interview with TCEP, Reinhart utilized her ability to play four different woodwind instruments and her experiences in her high school jazz band, wind ensemble and marching band. She expected to become a teacher’s assistant in a local high school wind ensemble. Instead, she was given a daunting assignment: teaching TCEP’s Adventures in Music curriculum to a class of elementary school students. 
“When I got my job assignment, I was teaching elementary school general music, and I was terrified,” Reinhart said. “I almost said no. But then I thought, ‘No, I should really get this experience — this would be good for me.’”
That demonstrates Reinhart’s eagerness to get out of her comfort zone. Like Jim Carrey’s character in the film Yes Man, Reinhart has stumbled into interesting experiences simply by keeping an open mind. Though she doesn’t confine her sights to performance, even within her performance endeavors, Reinhart said her goal is to be comfortable in as many musical settings as she can. She plays in Thornton’s Concert Jazz Orchestra and builds jazz practice into her daily routine.
I asked Reinhart about her experiences in playing both jazz and classical music. 
“When I was in high school, I used to do both classical and jazz, but I eventually had to abandon classical, because I would just start improvising — I couldn’t stick to the page,” she said.
Reinhart explained that she couldn’t keep her mind straight while being musically immersed in two distinct genres.
“I try to separate them as much as possible,” she answered with a laugh. “So, when I’m playing classical versus jazz, I have different setups, different mouthpieces.” 
But Reinhart’s musical ambidextrousness doesn’t end with genre. Once she finished her education, she hopes to become a doubler — a musician who plays multiple instruments at a high level. Among music directors, doublers are highly sought-after musicians, since on a film score or in a pit orchestra, a skilled doubler can play multiple musicians’ parts. Doubling is especially attractive to woodwind players because the family of instruments shares similarities in their playing technique.
For her part, Reinhart currently doubles on clarinet, flute and oboe, and she will be taking up the bassoon soon. When we spoke last week, Reinhart was deciding which graduate school to attend. She’d applied to five different master’s programs in woodwind doubling and been admitted to all of them, but was waiting to hear back about a few scholarships. 
I asked Reinhart if thinking about her commitment to a career in music makes her anxious.
“I think there’s in any creative field a certain amount of anxiety, just because what we do can change on a moment’s notice and you have to wear a lot of different hats,” Reinhart said. “I think now I’m more excited about that.”
Reinhart’s raw enthusiasm for music as well as her practicality shined in the way she talked about the graduate programs she was considering. After what must have been a nail-biting experience for her prospective professors, Reinhart messaged me to say she’s settled on the University of Michigan, where she will continue her education in classical and jazz performance.

With virtual reality at the forefront of the latest technological advances, VRSC, a community for virtual reality enthusiasts, will host its second annual student festival in the School of Cinematic Arts courtyard on Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The event features demonstrations of virtual, augmented and mixed reality projects from college students across the nation, as well as demonstrations and panels from industry leaders. It is the final event of SCA’s Talent Week, a series of events mixing students, alumni and professionals in the entertainment field, and it aims to foster a sense of community in the growing field of virtual reality.
Though it is centered around USC developers, students from universities such as Yale University, Chapman University, Harvard University and the University of California, Santa Cruz will also feature their work. Student projects will be seen by industry representatives from companies like Disney/ABC, Sony Entertainment and IMAX. However, the festival will also be open to anyone interested in the burgeoning field of virtual and augmented reality.
“Students should come to this event because VR and other interactive forms of entertainment are still in their infancy,” said Chandler Toffa, a sophomore majoring in film and television production and an organizer of the festival. “It’s incredible to see the amount of talent and innovation happening in this field, and it is inspiring to be shaping new communities and collaborations across the nation.”
The event begins with judging of the student demonstrations in the morning, and opens to the public at 1 p.m. In addition to demonstrations in the courtyard, there will be five presentations in the SCA Gallery, and the night concludes with a keynote speech and awards for student projects.
A panel of alumni, many of whom are MFA candidates in school or currently use virtual reality in their work, will present on integrating VR into film. Sony Pictures Entertainment will host a talk for students interested in being a VR Innovation Intern at the company, and industry experts will lead a discussion on the future of the form. 
Professor Ranjani Mazumdar from the School of Arts and Aesthetics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India will deliver a lecture on virtual reality’s  power to innovate storytelling mediums.
“VRSC is paving the way for cross-collaboration across the country, and we’re currently taking steps to bridge students from across the world to continue to create and innovate in this new and exciting world of storytelling,” said Toffa, who first became interested in VR after trying the Google Cardboard, a low-cost VR setup. “The experience changed the way I perceived traditional storytelling by simply giving me a new perspective.”
Toffa’s passion for VR is not unusual, as the form gained traction throughout the entertainment sector.
The group of students that present at the student festival could be industry leaders in the fast-paced world of cutting-edge virtual reality, and Toffa said he was excited to meet these innovators and see their work.
“I am very excited to finally meet all the applicants in person,” Toffa said. “I’ve been organizing this event for the past three or four months now, and still have yet to see many of their faces. I am also excited to host industry professionals and foster a sense of networking between the demoers.”
VRSC Student Festival 2017 is free and open to the public. RSVP is required. More information can be found online.

Last spring, Harvard University imposed sanctions on single-gender clubs and traditional fraternities. And for fall 2017 semester, students who join gender-segregated sororities or fraternities on campus will not be allowed to lead organizations or sports teams. Additionally, they will not be eligible for letters of recommendation from the dean of Harvard University for postgraduate opportunities. 
While Harvard’s new policy hopes to promote inclusivity, by undermining the critical role that some single-gender groups or identity-based clubs have, this policy could be counterproductive. The purpose of clubs is to give individuals a place where they feel like they belong and identify with their fellow members. 
“We have long held that a student’s socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, race or religion should not bar participation in our rush process,” Jake Aschert of Harvard University’s Alpha Epilson Pi chapter wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. “To keep with these values, we recognized that our group had to change so that a student’s gender would no longer stand in the way either.”
Ascher added, “We believe gender is trivial to experiencing the positive aspects of a greek organization, or the specific benefits and traditions of our chapter.”
When joining clubs, individuals seek to connect with and befriend those who share their interests or identity features. Clubs are exclusionary by principle. Unrelated to gender, homogenous groups such as black fraternities, sexual assault survivor groups, religious groups, LGBT groups or women’s advocacy organizations can have the effect of offering marginalized identities the spaces they need to be understood and respected, and ultimately allow underrepresented groups to represent themselves.
It is true that over time, some traditions of greek life and gender-segregated groups have become dated and perpetuate sexism. However, fraternities, sororities and single-gender greek organizations provide spaces for young women and men to experience sisterhood or brotherhood. Sanctions to address inclusivity and combat discrimination and intolerance toward gender-nonconforming or transgender individuals are much needed, but groups that are meant to give a space solely to a single identity group have crucial value to individuals of the identity group.
Banning single-gender societies does not promote feminism. Students should have the option to choose to join societies and organizations of people they relate and connect with, and people they feel safe associating with.
Additionally, for young women who may be frustrated with their experiences with sexual harassment or gender-based discrimination, the sisterhood they find in sororities can be empowering. It is also worth noting that fraternities and sororities do not exclude as a matter of sexism, but in order to adhere to policies set forth by the Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Council. 
Ascher also stated in his op-ed that his fraternity’s “internal discussions led [them] to the conclusion that [their] chapter’s male-only nature was not its defining characteristic.” 
“We have always placed far more emphasis on being a supportive and welcoming community than an all-male one,” Ascher said.
In the case of Ascher and his fraternity, the inclusion of female students into the Jewish fraternity could certainly have benefits. But young women who would rather join single-gender women’s groups where they feel included, represented and able to experience sisterhood deserve to have this option as well. 
The idea that single-gender or identity-specific groups must be allowed to exist does not necessitate that gender and identity-inclusive groups be prohibited. Inclusive and heterogeneous groups must be allowed and encouraged — and these groups can be encouraged without prohibiting niche identity groups, and punishing and denying autonomy to individuals seeking safe spaces and representation.
OK. I get it. But where does unfair discrimination by gender, identified gender, race or religion end? Is it OK if one of these groups excludes others? 
A whites only, straights only, or Christians only would be viewed as ugly and unfairly discriminatory. What about a blacks only, gays only, transgenders only, or Hispanics only group? What is the difference? 
Some are OK and deserve USC sponsorship, but others are not OK and should be banned? Discrimination by gender, identified gender, race or religion are fair and good when practiced by some groups, but unfair and bad when practiced by  others?
My opinion:  USC should sponsor, authorize or support no group that excludes others as part of its charter.
If people want to form or to join single-sex clubs, etc., they should be allowed to do so, without being punished by university administrators. Let’s hope that USC administrators never adopt Harvard administrators’ totalitarian mindset.

On Monday, researchers at New York University’s Langone Medical Center released an analysis of the reach of mental illness and the accessibility of care and resources, and their findings were deeply unsettling. According to data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collected from 2006 to 2014, 3.4 percent of the U.S. population — more than 8.3 million adult Americans — suffer from serious psychological distress, or SPD. The latest research prior to this estimated that the number of Americans affected by SPD was less than 3 percent. 
Alongside declining rates of access to mental health services, the spread of SPD is alarming. The same researchers found 9.5 percent of American adults surveyed in 2014 did not have access to psychiatrists and counselors in their health insurance, up from just 9 percent in 2006. And roughly 10 percent of Americans in 2014 could not afford psychiatric medications for their conditions, up from 8.7 percent in 2006.
The struggle to access mental health care as a result of socioeconomic status and limited insurance plans is a substantial problem. But unsettlingly enough, these are not the only obstacles to accessing care: Gender-based stigma not only dramatically skews self-reporting rates concerning depression and mental health, but also serves as a deadly deterrent for men who struggle with mental health but perceive getting help as a mark of weakness and femininity.
The gendered aspects of mental health are deeply nuanced, but it is impossible to fully understand the issue of mental health without awareness of  the experiences of different identity groups. Fifteen percent of people will develop depression over the course of their lifetimes, but twice as many women are diagnosed with depression as men. And from 2000 to 2011, the rate of suicides among adult Americans increased from 10.4 to 12.3 per 100,000 people. As Bloomberg noted in a 2014 report, there is a substantial gap in suicide rates between men and women — men are four times more likely to take their own lives.
Men are less likely to be diagnosed with depression, in part because they are less likely to self-report symptoms, but also because, as Bloomberg points out, men affected by depression may not demonstrate symptoms stereotypically associated with the condition. In either case, they are far less likely to seek and receive help. 
From a political standpoint, lawmakers talk in endless circles about what our tax dollars should and shouldn’t be paying for, while innumerable Americans who cannot afford help are forced to suffer through undignified living standards as a result of untreated mental illness.
And from a cultural standpoint, in a society in which masculinity is popularly portrayed as emotional detachment and control over one’s feelings, adherence to traditional notions of masculinity is absolutely requisite to being accepted and respected as a man. This social rigidity serves as yet another barrier to getting help, and as rates of suicide among men suggest, it carries grave potential consequences.
By no means does this trend suggest that women have it easier. It is impossible to know for certain whether more women are reporting symptoms simply because emotion is already associated with femininity, or whether women truly do suffer from depression at higher rates than men do. 
There certainly exists a relationship between identifying as part of a marginalized group and experiencing depression. Four percent of African Americans, who are more likely to face discrimination and be born into communities with fewer resources, experience depression, according to 2014 data from the CDC, compared with 3.1 percent of white Americans. A 2012 survey revealed 6 percent of gay men had attempted suicide, whereas less than 1 percent of heterosexual men had. And across the board, women are more likely to experience sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination in the workplace and other environments and difficulty accessing basic healthcare as a result of the politicization and policing of their bodies, among other gender-based struggles.
Still, the issue also remains that the reason there is less shame and stigma attached to women reporting depression and seeking help is as problematic as the reason men are less likely to be diagnosed with and treated for depression. Patriarchal society casts women as the gentler sex, the weak link. But this association of emotions with weakness, and of weakness with femininity, helps no one.
Access to resources and care for depression and SPD — which are, unsettlingly enough, on the rise — is increasingly being challenged by economic obstacles, but cultural stereotypes have always posed an additional barrier. Without access to healthcare for mental illness, rates of affected individuals may only continue to rise. And as skewed rates of depression diagnoses and suicide among the sexes suggest, gender roles, typically brushed off as a mere social issue, can have life-or-death consequences.

The Chinese Student and Scholar Association and the Department of Public Safety co-sponsored a social event at the Epstein Engineering Quad Tuesday night. The event aimed to cultivate stronger relationships between international students and DPS officers. CSSA members were encouraged to socialize and voice their concerns to DPS officers.
CSSA is a student organization mainly comprised of international Chinese students with about 200 active members, according to the organization’s president Yuefeng Zhang, a second-year graduate student studying epidemiology. Students stressed how the organization’s goal is to help international students from China.
“The purpose of CSSA is to serve all the Chinese students, not only [from an] academic perspective, but from [a] living perspective,” said Sihang Li, a member of CSSA and a sophomore majoring in accounting. 
The event is part of a recent DPS initiative in which officers have made efforts to reach out and strengthen relationships with USC students. Earlier this semester, a similar event was held with the Association of Indian Students. During the event, members of DPS explained the mentality behind law enforcement.
“It’s the direction that law enforcement and public safety is going, transitioning from a mentality that once was a warrior mentality to a guardian mentality, where we seek to be partners with the people that we serve,” DPS Chief John Thomas said. 
Many students gathered in small groups around seven officers, with each officer fielding questions and engaging in conversation. Safety concerns were an important issue for international students who attended, with some citing theft as a crime that they have experienced.
“Two years ago, a guy — a stranger — came into our house and tried to rob us,” Zhang said. “It’s pretty dangerous.” 
Li also experienced an account of theft.
“I believe it was last year, when we played basketball at Lyon Center, two of my friends lost their phones [from their bags],” Li said.
Participants also expressed concern about other forms of crime, especially scams. Examples ranged from people being tricked into purchasing fake designer brand items to tax and immigration calls attempting to extort money, according to DPS Community Relations Manager Elizabeth Carreno.
Furthermore, instances of online scammers tricking students into sending explicit photos and blackmailing them have been reported. To address these concerns, DPS officers emphasized the importance of having a relationship between students and officers.
“We want to form those relationships so that people will feel more comfortable if they have a public safety need in reaching out to people they know, not a stranger in a uniform,” said DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle.
DPS Liaison for International Students Erwin Valencia said the event was about “forming a dialogue” to “let [students] know we’re here for them.”
There was also an agreement that stronger bonds would help students become more knowledgeable about DPS services. Getting to know DPS would help students be safe, CSSA claims.
“DPS provides a lot of service but people just don’t know that. For example, they can walk you home,” Zhang said. “They’re faster than [the Los Angeles Police Department].”
At the end of the event, members of CSSA and DPS gathered for a group photo. Participants expressed a desire for closer ties between students and DPS as a result of the event.
“I think I’d definitely like to see improved relations and trust,” Carreno said. “Often times we see this as opportunities to get to know our officers, but it works both ways; it’s also an opportunity for our officers to get to know our students.”
