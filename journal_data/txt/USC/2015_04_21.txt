On Tuesday night, the Viterbi School of Engineering hosted the Information Technology Program Game Industry Career Night in the Ronald Tutor Hall which featured a panel of gaming professionals with years of experience in the industry.
Tom Sloper, video game designer and producer who has taught in the ITP department at USC for the past seven years, moderated the event. Panelists discussed a range of topics such as synthesizing creativity within programs and motivating yourself while creating large projects.
Sloper started working for Activision in 1988 and has worked on projects for Atari and Sega, as well as doing freelance games for Xbox Live and Nintendo DS.
David Dalzell works for Treyarch as the Principle Technical Artist. He began working at Activision 20 years ago and has worked on games such as Call of Duty. He worked in the corporate and publishing sectors of the company and now does game scripting.
“My job right now has a bunch of artists, designers and animators who make content and my job is to make all the stuff fit on the plastic disc,” David said.
Dalzell said he was always interested in doing art on the computer, but joining a large gaming company was a career he did not anticipate.
“The adaptability part is important,” David said. “You have to be able to change jobs very quickly because you will do 20 or 30 different things.”
Game designer Karen McMullen got an invitation to visit Ensemble Studios, which has produced games like Age of Empires and Halo, while interning for an architecture firm out of college. Inspired by the facility, she started learning 3D art and within three months, the studio’s executive producer had her build a game level that eventually launched into a massive campaign. She worked there for 10 years.
“Architecture prepared me well for that career,” McMullen said. “When you get opportunities like that, grab them.”
Currently, McMullen teaches at the Los Angeles film school and stressed the importance of the people you meet rather than each individual project.
“The people you work with are gong to be more important than any project you work on,” McMullen said. “Beyond that, you have to love what you do.”
Jeffrey Buchanan, who worked at the Department of Defense with technology such as the eight-inch gun system and weapon systems on standard ships, designed some of the first virtual fighter games and worked with Sega in Japan. He stressed the importance of staying committed to a project, which can often be exhausting and require hundreds of thousands of hours.
“When you start a project, do your best to finish what you start,” Buchanan said. “Don’t burn bridges. Hang in there. Get the project done. Get that project on your resume and keep the friendships you make.”
Bill Black began working in the music business and has worked on sound effects design and directing voiceovers. He worked on an exclusive contract with Activision from 1993 to 2001 and a company in Irvine that designed World of Warcraft.
“My early experiences really helped me learn everything such as animation, programming, production and all the areas of art,” Black said. “I really learned end-to-end development.”
Panelists gave their advice on balancing creativity, technical knowledge and connections.
“When you get older, it’s more about experience than the technical skill,” Black said. “You get to a point where you have to manage that next generation; you’re more valuable; your wisdom, experience, knowledge and contacts in the industry are more important than you actually doing the job.”
Dalzell described synthesizing creativity with the logistics of translating that onto a program.
“The main task of making games is solving problems,” Dalzell said. “Lots of people start [making games] as artists with creative ideas … once you learn how to get things in the game and you make it less [sic] complicated.”
McMullen said the industry has been incredibly self-motivating and rewarding for her.
“I’ve found being more technical empowering,” McMullen said. “I ask myself, ‘How do I get this in the game?’ Well, I figure it out.”
The panelists told attendants to anticipate the stress of a project’s “crunch time,” the time when a company deadline is fast approaching, and to expect some disastrous projects as well as immensely successful ones.
“The difference between the nightmare project and a project that’s just hard is the success of a project,” David said. “When you’ve worked seven days a week and 20 hours a day and it doesn’t go anywhere, that’s pretty awful. When I worked on the last Call of Duty, it was completely worth it because people knew about it.”
Buchanan advised students not to get discouraged by difficult or unsuccessful projects.
“Sometimes you’ll work really hard on a project and just like anything in life, the pieces just might not all fit together,” Buchanan said. “You did your best; be proud of your work and know the work you put into it.”
McMullen urged students to continually work on gaming projects throughout their careers, even if only for personal practice.
“Never stop making games,” McMullen said. “You should always have games that you’re kicking around and showing people for fun.”
The panel concluded with a Q&A where students had the opportunity to ask questions about gaming.
“I want to get into the game industry, so it was useful to hear firsthand from professionals about their opinions on the industry and get their background about how they got involved,” said Zach Hyter, a senior majoring in natural sciences and minoring in video game design.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that the name of one panelist is Jeffrey Ken. His name is actually Jeffrey Buchanan. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

A group of graduate students from the School of Social Work organized a march to mobilize the Los Angeles region for the passage of the End Racial Profiling Act of 2015, which is currently sitting in both houses of Congress.
With about 100 people in attendance, the march started at USC Hybrid High and ended at the Federal Court Building in downtown Los Angeles.
The goal of the march, which took place on April 19, was to create awareness for ERPA. Though some form of the act has been introduced to Congress since the Bush administration, the bill has never actually been up for a vote.
“The End Racial Profiling Act of 2015 calls for a clear definition of racial discriminatory practices involving racial profiling at all levels,” said Omar Avila, a first-year graduate student studying social work and one of the main organizers of this movement, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It also calls for federal prohibition of racial profiling, mandates collection of data involving racial biases, provides funding for retraining of officers, and most importantly, it holds law enforcement accountable.”
The march featured a variety of speakers, including Cheryl Dorsey, a retired LAPD sergeant and other notable community members.
“It grew from the classroom to the streets,” said Caitlin Freige, a first-year graduate student studying social work. “We wanted to be visible of what we were studying and researching [to be visible].”
Avila said he and his team had set up tables at the end of the march to register people to vote so their voices could be heard. He said that the group formed a petition that they plan to send to members of Congress showing the mass support in favor of the legislation.
Freige said this issue has always been passion of hers.
“I grew up in Los Angeles in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots,” Freige said. “So I watched my dad leave and I wasn’t sure if he’s going to come home. I had first-hand experience with the civil unrest due to racial profiling and race-initiated violence in general.”
The team is now working on a petition to present in front of Congress.
According to Joseph DiMartino, a first-year graduate student of social work, the group is hoping to build support among students at USC to help get this act passed. He said the first step is to educate students about the bill and what it would actually do.
“This whole idea of color blindness and not seeing that our diversity is almost a new form of racism and especially with law enforcement and them saying that there is no racial profiling happening is very skewed,” DiMartino said.
Freige said she wants to see more students involved in this movement on campus.
“We have a lot of great people here that could really [impact] this movement so I just want to see everyone out with us,” Freige said.
Avila said he enjoyed seeing all the support during the march.
“It was a good experience not only [to march] downtown, but [also] to see the support that people were giving us. Our next step is continuing to get signatures for our petition so we could [raise] more awareness,” Avila said.

During the Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting, newly appointed Treasurer Tiffany Chang announced the various budget expenses for the upcoming 2015-2016 academic year.
“In regards to income, we get our budget from a $64 stipend per student per semester, with a base number of 15,000 students,” Chang said. “We also get carry-over income from previous years.”
Chang then discussed the budget divisions for Student Affairs programming: the volunteer center, LEAD programs and Conquest.
“We’re trying to have Conquest cover more of the production part of the program because it is one of the biggest events on campus,” Chang said. “We want to take the burden off of Concerts Committee, because now they have to cover both the artist[s] and production.”
All USG branches received an increase in funding for next year. The professional academic fund received $40,000 in expenditures, philanthropy received $82,000, leadership received $77,000 and discretionary received $112,000.
Chang said some parts of the budget were allocated to ensure a better team dynamic and development.
“It’s in our bylaws that allocations are used to better establish our team and make it more cohesive so that everybody can talk about their vision and really have a face outside of the office,” Chang said.
Chang said there has also been a $2,000 increase in public relations funds.
“This increase happened because this year, our USG website got hacked eight times in a week,” Chang said. “So this is for more security.”
The Academic Culture Assembly also presented their proposals during the meeting. Hannah Nguyen, the incoming director of ACA, explained the assembly’s mission is to “encourage the merit of learning through interdisciplinary exploration and programming.”
Some of ACA’s signature events include Beyond Books, EDmonth, TEDxTrousdale and Study Nights.
Nguyen discussed ACA’s goals for this upcoming academic year, highlighting specific events that would attract a large gathering of students.
“We want to foster mental health awareness and advocacy,” Nguyen said. “We also want to maximize potential of our signature events, such as Study Nights.”
ACA’s Study Nights are a space for students to unwind during finals. Added features of Study Nights would include massages, puppies, a drawing wall, food vendors, free blue books and scantrons, care packages from the health center and counseling services. Study Nights have drawn over 3,000 students each semester.
Other goals included growing EDmonth, solidifying its platform for education justice and establishing of the ACA community building, which ACA explained would offer support, guidance, exposure, monthly one-on-one meetings, organization meeting visits and member organization mixer events.
“We just really want to expose students to the academic possibilities on campus … especially for transfer students, who might not know what major and minors they can pursue, or which student organizations they can join,” Nyguyen said.
Nguyen also said ACA’s mental health awareness week runs from Oct. 5 Oct. 11. The week contains such sample events as a slam poetry night at Ground Zero, speaker events, workshops and forums.
“One thing I really want to stress about mental awareness week is that we really want to ensure that this programming translates into action and change for students,” Nyguyen said.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Chang said USG represents a base number of 16,000 students. They actually represent a base number of 15,000 students. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

When I covered the men’s volleyball team last spring, I vividly remember thinking at the end of the season, “This team is going to be great next year.” Early on, the Trojans certainly were; they started the season 7–0 and looked to be poised to take the top spot in the national poll.
Though the team has nonetheless performed well since then, the Trojans finished closer to the middle of the pack regionally and nationally at the end of the regular season. As the Trojans head into their conference tournament, it’s now or never for the team to reach its full potential and go from good to great.
The Trojans snuck into the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference tournament last year. At 14-10 in conference play, the Trojans finished just ahead of 13-11 Hawai’i for the eighth and final spot in the conference tournament. But living on the edge proved to be too dangerous for the Trojans as they were quickly dispatched in the first round by top-seeded BYU in three sets.
The team lost a fair amount of players from that squad. Opposites Tanner Jansen and Maddison McKibbin were regular contributors; Henry Cassiday was a four-year starter at libero.
But more important was what was coming back. Big men Chris Lischke, Robert Feathers and Andy Benesh would be forces up the middle for the Trojans. Lucas Yoder, the MPSF Freshman of the Year, would return as an outside hitter. Libero Brooks Varni had waited his turn patiently behind Cassiday, and he would fill in nicely as the defensive leader.
Most importantly, though, the Trojans would bring back a true superstar for his senior season. Micah Christenson, the setter for the U.S. men’s national team, would return to the Galen Center for his final season and lead the Trojan offense one more time.
On top of a great roster, the team had a very experienced coaching staff. Along with four assistant coaches who had been with the Trojans for at least three years, the team was lead by Bill Ferguson, who was going into his ninth year at the helm of the program.
Ferguson has accomplished almost everything as a coach. He’s won the regular season conference, he’s won the conference tournament, he’s been named coach of the year in the conference, and he’s advanced to the national championship match twice. The only thing missing from his resume is that legacy-defining championship. He was three sets away one year and one set away another, but he still hasn’t gotten that monkey off his back. That, however, is representative of the nature of small sample sizes,  as well as the competitiveness of the sport, more so than anything about Ferguson’s attributes as a coach. It’s impossible to put a team in that position multiple times without being an elite-level coach, but very possible for thin margins and lucky bounces to be the difference between a banner.
With that being said, I felt like this was going to be the year. The talent was there, and the staff had worked together as a team during the entire career of everyone on the roster at that time. This was finally going to be the one where they did it.
A look at the team’s national ranking leads to some skepticism to this plane — the team is ranked    No. 8 in the country by the American Volleyball Coaches Association national poll. But that is indicative of the teams inconsistent execution rather than its great potential. Similarly, the Trojans sit at No. 4 in the MPSF standings not because they couldn’t beat the three teams ahead of them, but because they couldn’t do so twice. This year’s poll is topped by UC Irvine followed by BYU and Pepperdine — just kidding, Hawai’i is at number two — all of whom the Trojans have split with. Similar inconsistencies with lesser conference rivals like UCLA and UCSB explain why USC still sits toward the middle rather than the top.
Finishing in the top four is nonetheless crucial. The difference between fourth and fifth place is critical in the standings, much more so than any other pair of positions besides eighth and ninth place. Fourth place assures that the first round of the quarterfinal match is at home rather than on the road. The semifinal and final round are played the following weekend all at the home court of the first seed.
Sitting in that crucial fifth place spot is BYU, the team that dominated USC at home last season in the tournament. The Cougars, much like the Trojans or any team, really, play much better at home than on the road. The Trojans were swept during a two-match regular season trip to BYU last season, and Ferguson says the fan base for the Cougars really comes out hard to support the team.
If the Trojans can avenge last season’s elimination against BYU this weekend, the road to the NCAA tournament does not get any easier.
The Trojans would need to upset top seed UC Irvine at home and at the quarterfinals for even a shot at an at-large bid to the national championship tournament. Even that likely won’t be enough. There are only two at large bids for the tournament in the entire country, and the Trojans likely need to win the MPSF tournament to claim the conference’s automatic qualifier.
It’s not impossible, but the odds would certainly stack against the Trojans chances of doing so. The Trojans beat UC Irvine the first time through MPSF play in late January, but were defeated the second time through this past March.
There’s a sense of urgency to this year’s playoffs. The “this is going to be the year” mentality is just a more positive way of saying that it feels like now or never.  The preceding year, the Trojans didn’t even make the MPSF tournament. When Christenson graduates, the team will take on a totally new dynamic and will probably have to go into             re-building mode.
The 2012 season was Christenson’s freshman year, and the Trojans were defeated in the national championship game by UC Irvine. There’s no doubt that he and the rest of the seniors remember that game, so any rematch in the                      post-season with the Anteaters is sure to bring out the best in the Trojans. It’s a brand new season, and the Trojans will have to play with the same fire and intensity that they did earlier this year when it was still a brand new season.
Today, an appearance in the NCAA tournament would feel like an accomplishment. But if you asked back in January, before it all started, anything short of a national championship would have been a disappointment. I don’t think it is likely, and I think it will take the program some time to even get back into this position after this season. But I do think a national championship is still a legitimate possibility for this team. Besides being any other USC team, the players and coaches of the men’s team have been particularly fun to cover and have shown great class over the past two seasons, so I am really rooting for them to pull it off.
The team worked very hard to earn that home court advantage in the quarterfinals this weekend.  Let’s do our part and come out in droves for our Trojans this Saturday night at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center.

You must have watched a different team at the end of last year than I saw. They got swept badly at BYU in the 1st round of the conference tourney. Recruiting was mediocre with only Larry Tuiletta a highly regarded freshman. Ferguson has not achieved
much of anything with top players, and then he has recruited poorly the last few years with the exception of Micah Christenson
at setter.
What has happened to Lucas Yoder his sophomore year? I only heard he was ill at start of the season, and then beaten out by others. A complete starting team never developed all season. Of course I wish them the best in every match they play, and hopefully the team will surprise here in the postseason tournament with a very good showing.

The No. 1-ranked women’s golf team is struggling to find their groove in the Pac-12 tournament, set to conclude Wednesday in Boulder, Colorado.  After two rounds, the Women of Troy are 17-over and 12 shots back of co-leaders Oregon and UCLA.
Heading into the tournament, USC had four wins to accompany seven top-2 finishes.
The first day got off to a rocky start following a delay due to inclement weather.  The day did not get much better for the Women of Troy from there as they finished with a final score of a 9-over 293.  The team was in sixth place after the first round, nine back of leader Oregon who finished shooting an even par round.  They were closely trailed by Stanford at 2-over and UCLA at 3-over.
Sophomore Gabriella Then led the Women of Troy by carding a 1-over 72 in the first round of play Monday.  Her two-birdie round was good enough to tie her for 12th overall.
Freshman Amy Lee is just behind Then, tied for 21st with a score of 2-over.
As the second day of play began to close, USC appeared to be making up some of the lost ground.  The team suffered a massive blow when it gave up six shots over the final three holes.  This setback slotted them into fifth place with a score of  17-over.  Oregon and UCLA are 12 strokes ahead, tied for the lead at 5-over.  Arizona and Washington are just behind the leaders with scores of 6-over and 8-over respectively.  Host Colorado is tied with USC.
Keeping pace with their team performance, the Women of Troy bunched together in the middle of the field.  Sophomore Karen Chung was the best performer of the day with a score of 1-over; however, the score was only good enough to move her into a tie for 25th with an overall score of 6-over.
Then and Lee are tied for 19th at 4-over at the top of the USC leaderboard.  Junior Annie Park is tied for 23rd at 5-over.  Park won the Pac-12 title as a freshman but has yet to find her way in this tournament.
USC is chasing the sixth conference title in program history when the competition wraps up on Wednesday afternoon.

Madison Westby, a freshman on the No. 2-ranked Women of Troy tennis team, took home Pac-12 Player of the Week honors for the second time this season after a strong, match-clinching performance this past Thursday.
Facing the No. 5-ranked,  cross-town rival UCLA Bruins, Westby battled both a worthy opponent in No. 28 ranked Kyle McPhillips and a nagging injury sustained during a second-set tiebreaker to seal the win for the Women of Troy. Ranked at No. 78, Westby was deemed a considerable underdog heading into the match, but her grit and determination willed her to a 5-7, 7-6 (5), 6-4 win as USC took home the 4-3 victory over the Bruins and completed an undefeated season in the Pac-12 conference. The win avenged a March 4 loss to UCLA in Westwood, 4-3 and marked the second time in the past three seasons that the Women of Troy have finished with an undefeated record in the Pac-12 conference.
With her heroic performance Thursday, Westby now finds herself riding a six-game winning streak in singles play, where she sports a 22-7 overall record. She has also had a productive season in doubles, boasting a 14-5 record while pairing with fellow freshmen Gabby Smith and Meredith Xepoleas throughout the season.
This was the second Player of the Week award for Westby this season in what has been a remarkable campaign for the freshman from Tulsa, Oklahoma. She took home her first career award for her performance in USC’s Feb. 14 upset home victory over then-No.11 Vanderbilt at Marks Stadium.
In strikingly similar fashion to her Pac-12 title clinching victory Thursday, Westby led a             come-from-behind effort to seal a 4-3 win against the Commodores for the then-No. 12 Women of Troy. After falling behind to then-No. 68 senior Marie Casares 4-6 in her first set, Westby rallied to win her next two sets 6-3, 6-3 and earn the victory for USC. Westby was also part of a winning doubles effort earlier in the day, as she and Smith turned in an 8-6 victory that won the decisive doubles point for the Women of Troy after the team split their first two doubles matches with the Commodores.
USC women’s tennis is currently enjoying what has been a phenomenal season. After defeating UCLA Thursday, the team finished their regular season with a 21-2 overall record and a perfect 10-0 mark in Pac-12 conference play. The Women of Troy have enjoyed a No. 1 national ranking at times throughout this season, but currently sit at No. 2 entering the Pac-12 Championships that begin April 23 in Ojai, California and run through April 26.
Following that tournament, Westbty and her team will turn their sights toward the NCAA DI Championships at the Hurd Tennis Center in Waco, Texas. The tourney will run from May 14 through May 25, with the team championships playing out first before the individual championships round out the back end of the competitions. The team championship match is currently slated for May 19, while the individual championship is slated for May 25.
USC will be looking to build upon a strong tournament performance last year at the NCAA championships, where the No. 16-ranked Women of Troy advanced to the Sweet 16 after an opening-round 4-0 victory over Idaho and a 4-2 win over Michigan before dropping a heartbreaking 4-2 loss to No. 1 Georgia.
Undoubtedly, the team has its eyes set on a deeper postseason run this year, and Westby will be one vital factor in determining their success.

Brittany Howard, lead singer and guitarist of Alabama Shakes, describes her mentality during performances as “latching on to a feeling, riding it, trying not to come out of it. You stop thinking, you’re just performing — that’s the spirit world.” She puts an impossible amount of energy behind both her vocals and her dance moves. A born performer, Howard has an Alabama tattoo on her shoulder, which speaks volumes to the pride she has for both her music and her state.
The speed of Alabama Shakes’s ascension to stardom is remarkable. In the span of only a few years, the Alabama natives went from complete obscurity to playing the largest stage at Coachella, and for good reason. The soulful brand of down-home southern rock is both edgy and comforting, and the band’s newest album Sound & Color is a psychedelic twist on classic rock that is absolutely stunning.
In 2012, Alabama Shakes released their first album Boys & Girls, a hearty blend of a soul and rock reminiscent of an earlier era in American music, and it seemed they were on top of the world. Scoring three Grammy nominations for Best New Artist, Best Rock Performance for “Hold On” and Best Recording Package, the young band came out swinging. “Hold On” was given heavy radio play for its simple hook and heartfelt bellows by Howard, and the band’s newest project certainly provides more incredible vocalizations.
Hearing many of the tracks on Sound & Color for the first time is powerful. Tracks such as “Gimme All Your Love” push Howard’s voice to its breaking point over calm guitar instrumentation that serves to highlight the songstress’ incredible ability. There are impressive builds that make your heart pound, such as in the funky “Don’t Wanna Fight,” which features a pronounced bass riff as its main musical spine and staccato guitar to punctuate each verse. Overall, Sound & Color is moving, using every instrument to its fullest range, whether it be quiet and mellow or bombastic and tense.
Opening the album is a lonely vibraphone, floating through notes like a ship on calm waters. “Sound & Color” is the track, and its wispy nature is a perfect opening to an album full of peaks and valleys and psychedelic guitar licks. When the slow, airy vocals end, “Don’t Wanna Fight” comes in heavy with a staccato guitar riff and a squeal, described by the Atlantic as “a deflating balloon” from Howard.
“What you like, what I like. Why can’t we both be right?” sings Howard, pleading for freedom from a relationship that seems based on disagreements. The soulful singer, who claimed in a BET interview her influences were David Bowie and Nina Simone, among others, has a commanding presence on each track, and her voice is truly unique. Though Alabama Shakes does not sound like Bowie or Simone, it is easy to draw some comparisons in the airy, sometimes dark vocals on Sound & Color to the collections of work these two artists have amassed. There are hard rock elements and spacey vibes, appealing to a wide audience of adults and kids alike.
Breaking from the model of traditional southern rock, Sound & Color is a venture into different styles of rock ‘n’ roll, and each track has a unique style choice perfect for its message. “Gemini,” a track nestled deep into the album about relationships (a common theme on Sound & Color) employs the Jack White style of wailing guitar that made him so famous, raising the emotional stakes of the song with a guitar that sounds like its crying. “The Greatest” uses a lo-fi filter and quick rhythm reminiscent of ’50s and ’60s rock similar to the early Beatles, and “Guess Who” sounds like a reggae anthem. Every track flows seamlessly into the next, united by Howard’s incredible voice.
By experimenting with style, Alabama Shakes has crafted a series of hits that are each unique and powerful, but that also work together in a beautiful masterpiece of Southern rock. Sound & Color is full of funk, rock, blues and above all else, soul. Howard’s impressive vocal range and stamina lend greatly to the prestige of Alabama Shakes, but the band’s ability to move through genres seamlessly and still sound unified and unique is one of a kind.
“See, I’ve been having me a real hard time / But it feels so nice to know I’m gonna be all right,” sings Howard on “This Feeling,” and Alabama Shakes’s upward trajectory surely must feel nice. Sound & Color is one of the best albums I’ve ever heard. It is honest and soulful, both proud and humble; there is nothing holding back these Alabama natives musically. Listen to Sound & Color when you have a moment, and you absolutely will not be disappointed.

USC alumnus Brett Meiselas has quickly found a foothold in an increasingly competitive entertainment industry. After graduating from the School of Cinematic Arts as a critical studies major in 2012, he began working on The Ellen Show, for which he was nominated for an Emmy. Meiselas’s latest project, We’re the Jasons, is a feature-length mockumentary based on the real-life comedians Jason Blackman and Jason Bader, both of whom are high school friends of Meiselas. The story follows the two comedians as they hit the road on a comedy tour to New York, hoping to become hometown heroes.
Through their journey to comedy success, these comedians discover their own misguided views of fame and fortune. The documentary style captures their larger-than-life characters with exaggerated humor and all the good and bad moments they experience on their adventures.
The video on their Kickstarter page shows the two Jasons acting in two pre-filmed scenes. In the first, Bader quits his job in not-quite-Jerry-Maguire fashion with plenty of awkward humor mined out of this famous film trope. The second scene shows Blackman breaking up with his girlfriend in preparation for the tour. In a much more absurd scene than the first one in the video, Blackman’s girlfriend explains that he has been breaking up with her periodically after any semi-major life event since he left for summer camp when they were children.
The inspiration for this project came from the dynamic comedy duo themselves. Meiselas had helped produce their comedic work that appeared on outlets such as the The Huffington Post and Funny or Die. When the two approached Meiselas to pitch the idea for this project, Meiselas jumped at the opportunity to get on board.
“They are some of the funniest guys and they always make me laugh,” said Meiselas.
The Jasons were also inspired by the mockumentary genre that made shows such as The Office and Parks and Recreation so popular.
“We felt there was still room in the genre to create something really unique and funny,” Meiselas said.
Meiselas and the Jasons focused on featuring real-life people and situations in the film to help make their characters come to life for a unique spin on this TV and film platform.
Meiselas said the project’s biggest challenge was raising money.
“Even a cheap film costs a significant amount of money,” Meiselas said.
The Kickstarter campaign hopes to raise $40,000 — the minimum amount they believe could help make this movie — through donations.
“We have such talented people working on this project,” Meiselas said.
Though Meiselas admits that there is a tough, long road ahead, he is excited about the potential for this project. He said the team will ideally reach its funding goal and begin filming part of the project this summer. He would then enter the post-production phase as editor and producer of the film before the team would hopefully begin distribution of the project. Meiselas hopes to release the film on-demand, a platform he thinks is an effective medium for pieces like this.
An avid lover of his alma mater USC, Meiselas credits his success to the film school that gave him his start.
“Being a critical studies major, you are kind of an underdog when it comes to production experience,” Meiselas said.  “I worked at Trojan Vision while at USC and I was shocked to find how similar it was to working on The Ellen Show.”

Over the past four months, USC students have received a sudden influx of email alerts from the Dept. of Public Safety, and it’s not just about a rise in cell phone theft. Since January, DPS has received 16 reports of sexual harassment near campus. In these 16 incidents, a man, who police suspect is the same person, approached unsuspecting female victims from behind, hit or grabbed their buttocks, and then taunted the victims as he fled.
The sheer number of incidents alone is shocking, but still more surprising is the relative silence from faculty and students surrounding the incidents. Up until earlier this month, when an anonymous student group USC Girl Mafia began posting flyers, the only real talk of the incidents came in the form of the next DPS report or humor. Though it’s understandable to react with discomfort or address unsettling situations with humor, USC Girl Mafia has shown that we need greater awareness to put an end to such harassment.
As news reports have emphasized, the serial fondlings are acts of crimes. On KTLA 5 News, anchor Steve Kuzj asserts that the perpetrator, a 16- to 21-year-old male with spiky hair and a slim build, must be caught before his actions escalate to rape or murder. This media attention certainly lends a new level of urgency to the matter, but we need to recognize that this one issue isn’t an isolated instance of gender-based harassment at USC. Regardless of whether or not the serial fondler strikes again, we can all look to the response to this issue as a launch pad for confronting sexism on our campus.
Thankfully, the positive hype initiated by USC Girl Mafia to combat the serial fondlings has led to a greater activism to eliminate gender-based discrimination. The group’s anonymity has lent all the more significance to its efforts; in focusing on a nameless collective goal, USC Girl Mafia promotes inclusivity, allowing all students to feel comfortable spreading awareness of this issue. In an interview for Neon Tommy, an anonymous member of the group said, “The USC Girl Mafia is anyone who believes that anyone should be able to walk down the street without being in danger of someone assaulting them, harassing them or otherwise feel unsafe.” By breaking the silence and stepping forward when the rest of the university was unsure how to react, USC Girl Mafia started a trend. Thanks to their endeavors, people have addressed the serial fondlings on Annenberg TV News, NBCLA, ABC 7 and KTLA 5 with unanimous urgency and disgust.
Unfortunately, this campaign is only the tip of the iceberg. The group’s Twitter page boasts only 116 followers at the moment, and the group’s founding members are graduating this semester. Unless the group gains more momentum, USC Girl Mafia might wind up eclipsed by the deeply ingrained sexism on our campus. Indeed, even USC student YouTuber TristanTales’ humorous confrontation of the serial fondlings in his video “USC Booty Bandit” reflects harmful gender-based stereotypes at USC. The distasteful use of stereotypes within the skit reflects the prevalence of sexism at USC. At one point in the video, TristanTales asks a female volunteer to stand on the sidewalk and look “sorority-like” in a comedic attempt to lure the attacker.
The assumption that the victims must have been sorority girls en route to or from a party echoes the common stereotype that sorority members — or any young women attending college parties — somehow set themselves up for sexual assault. It is unlikely that TristanTales intended to blame victims for the attacks, but the link between Greek life and sexual harassment reeks of stereotype. Moreover, the YouTuber later asks an alleged victim’s roommate what her friend’s “booty” looks like, as if a “voluptuous” bottom is an invitation for groping. Certainly, we cannot label one student’s comedic sketch as representative of the entire university. Yet, close to 8,000 people have watched the video without leaving a negative comment. Considering the fact that USC has spent the past year under Title IX investigation for mishandling campus sexual assault, this is a cause for concern.
We should thus confront this issue of serial fondling with all this in mind. The current level of commitment to apprehend the serial fondler is a step in the right direction, but USC Girl Mafia pointed out in Neon Tommy that these attacks aren’t occurring in a “vacuum.” Not only will the perpetrator be held accountable for his crimes, but the fondlings must be considered in light of the continued sexism on campus. It is easy to call out a perpetrator who appears separate from USC, but we must apply the same unified vigilance to sexual objectification and victim blaming that exist within the university.

According to a recent report by The New York Times, the use of e-cigarettes among middle school and high school students tripled between 2013 and 2014. The growing appeal lies in the ability for students to do smoke tricks with their e-cigarettes, also known as vapes. This rise in an alternative to traditional smoking for teenagers, however, is cause for concern.
The use of cigarettes has declined from 16 percent to 9 percent between 2011 and 2014. Some researchers believe that this decrease is a positive change, as e-cigarettes are a healthier alternative to the tar-filled, chemical-infused cigarettes that kill 480,000 Americans a year. The problem, though, is that teenagers who have never smoked before are starting to become attracted to substances that are still harmful.
To understand the appeal to teenagers, The New York Times consulted James, a 17-year-old high school senior in Virginia. Regarding his use of e-cigarettes, James said, “It was something for us to do that was edgy and exciting.” James also said he had started using e-cigarettes at 13 when he took his father’s discarded devices.
James is just one of many teenagers who use products with nicotine. With an increase of these usages, the Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to regulate e-cigarettes, but teen smoking habits are forming exponentially faster. Anti-tobacco advocates worry that e-cigarettes will become a norm in our society and especially among the younger generation.
E-cigarettes are deemed to be healthier than tobacco by doctors, but their healthiness is only relative to traditional cigarettes. They still contain nicotine, which can lead to addiction. There are still a myriad of negative health effects that come with the use of e-cigarettes. According to WebMD, e-cigarettes can cause clogged arteries and can even become a gateway drug. Though there is a successful decade-long campaign in place working to decrease smoking rates, e-cigarettes could actually encourage more smoking and illicit drug use, according to a World Health Organization report in August 2014. Currently, 13 percent of the high school population is smoking e-cigarettes, and the number is growing. 4.6 million middle and high school students have used some form of tobacco in the last year, and with the growing prevalence of e-cigarette and hookah use, that number has risen by about 400,000 in the last year.
To avoid these issues, parents and people licensed to sell e-cigarettes must prevent middle and high-school students from smoking excessively. Regulation is key in curbing addiction. People addicted to cigarettes might find help in replacing them with e-cigarettes, but more caution should be reserved for teenagers who still have developing bodies and are more vulnerable to these chemicals.
Research on chemicals found in e-cigarettes is also important. The debate about the effects of nicotine and whether it leads to cancer is still ongoing. The harmfulness of other carcinogens has also been questioned. For the sake of public health, scientists should be able give definite answers about the safety of e-cigarettes before people are allowed to start smoking them.
Though e-cigarettes are technically healthier alternatives, they are creating a wave of interest in younger generations who are more susceptible to experiment ingwith tobacco. Regulations must be set and parents must be warned that e-cigarettes do still harm users. Teens should not be encouraged to start using these cigarettes except to be used as alternatives to curb the addiction of cigarettes.
Until further research determines the effects of e-cigarettes, young adults should turn away from this trend and realize that smoke tricks might not seem so cool when their health is at stake.

Sometimes relentless optimism is frustrating, especially when surrounded by a bitterly pragmatic world in which change only comes glacially, if at all. And perhaps it’s even more exasperating to understand why political, social and economic problems aren’t resolved the way we’d like them to. In fact, even though individuals act in their own self-interest, straightforward interactions between individuals often result in less-than-optimal outcomes.
In the social simulation of game theory, philosophers often frame the discussions of cooperation and coordination as a form of the classic prisoner’s dilemma. In this example, two prisoners are caught for a crime. If both stay silent, they can both be declared innocent. If one defects, that prisoner is safe, while the other is imprisoned. And if they both defect, they both face jail time.
While the most obvious solution is for neither prisoner to defect, as both will escape prison, game theory explains that the rational choice is for an individual prisoner to defect, since it is in the prisoner’s best self-interest—and thus if both defect, they will both face jail time. Here, while performing the option that maximized the individual self-interest, both prisoners actually found themselves in an outcome that was worse for both of them.
Even though it describes a specific circumstance, the prisoner’s dilemma describes a much larger range of situations. A common political example is an arms race, in which stopping nuclear stockpiling benefits both countries, but they continue to stockpile out of fear of the other country’s nuclear supply. It’s a cycle of noncooperation that can only be broken with a repetition of interactions that builds trust — a near-impossible concept to truly build considering the diverse interests of different actors in the political and economic arena.
From a philosophical standpoint, it is, of course, an oversimplification to assume that every single person acts only in his or her self-interest. I’d like to think that people do the right thing instead of the most convenient one — but perhaps game theory proves that not only is the moral solution unrealistic, but that it’s also nearly impossible.
It’s a sobering thought.

Who knew that fallen and scattered marble stones and pillars could take your breath away?
I surely didn’t. Well, not until this past weekend when I went to Rome, Italy and became the ultimate tourist.
I first realized the beauty of a time long past while in the Foro Romano, or Roman Forum. From my vantage point, standing on the highest point of the Forum, all of Rome was laid out before me. The Vatican was to my left while the Trevi Fountain sparkled on my right (despite it being under construction). The city was peppered with auburn basilica domes and had a soundtrack of traffic from the congested streets with motorinos and taxis speeding past each other.
In Rome, the Colosseum is the site that by far gets the most attention. In all our high school history classes we learn about this wonder of the world that was used for gladiatorial combats and stood as a symbol for the strength of the Roman Empire.
After spending a jam-packed two full days in Rome, I realized it really shouldn’t command such a large spotlight. (This probably sounds blasphemous coming from a Trojan who spends her Saturdays during football season in our own worshipped version of the Roman structure).
Yet, to reduce Rome to one ancient structure is wrong.
I truly realized this after getting lost of in the Foro Romano for about an hour. Before entering, I thought it would be a quick trip to see some fallen pillars and possibly some artifacts. But what I found was an entirely different Rome, complete with remains of homes, still flourishing gardens and the best views of the city.
Rome is a city preserved. Therefore, if you only have a few days or even hours to be in this historic city you should spend your time exploring all the other sites it has to offer. (Plus, the Colosseum can be seen from the plane).
So head to the Castel Sant’Angelo, which is the site of Emperor Hadrian’s mausoleum or the Spanish Steps for an hour or two to sit and eat lunch and people watch. And whatever you do, don’t leave Italy without eating gelati at least three times.
Rome wasn’t built in a day, but I learned that you could definitely see thousands of years of history in one. So keep your mind open during your Italian excursion.
Ciao for now!
