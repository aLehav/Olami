University Kidney Research Organization will honor USC’s Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett at its gala dinner on Friday, Sept. 12 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The gala will raise funds for the USC/UKRO Kidney Research Center at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.
Garrett will receive the award for Extraordinary Achievement in Academic Leadership. Garrett, USC’s second ranking officer, is responsible for hiring faculty and has been striving to improve the universitiy’s academic reputation. “Provost Elizabeth Garrett has a tireless commitment to building the University of Southern California and to elevating its position in the pantheon of top American universities,” UKRO President Kenneth Kleinberg told HSC News. “Not least through the school’s strategy of recruiting world-class talent for all academic and scientific disciplines … Garrett has strongly supported UKRO’s efforts to make kidney disease a true center of excellence at the Keck School of Medicine, and for this we and all who battle kidney disease are grateful beyond words.”
According to their website, the USC/UKRO Kidney Research Center hopes to eventually find a cure for kidney disease as well as improve upon existing treatments through basic and applied research. Kleinberg, who was diagnosed with a kidney ailment in 1999, founded the organization with his doctor, Vito M. Campese, professor of medicine and division chief of the Department of Nephrology at Keck. Kleinberg underwent kidney dialysis for six years before receiving a kidney transplant in 2007.
Garrett will be honored along  with Barry Hoeven, a cancer survivor and founder of Westport Properties, Inc. and US Storage Center, Inc. who is receiving the award for Outstanding Achievement in Business and Industry. Lynda Oschin, wife of the late L.A. businessman and philanthropist Samuel Oschin, will receive the Spirit of Life award. ABC7 Eyewitness news anchor Phillip Palmer will be master of ceremonies at the gala and Ambassador of the Great American Songbook Michael Feinstein will give a special performance.
Athletic Director Pat Haden was previously honored at the UKRO Benefit Dinner in 2012.

Admission to the Los Angeles County Fair will be free this Saturday to current USC students, faculty and staff. The fair takes place at the Pomona Fairplex and Saturday hours are from 10 a.m. to midnight.
USC Recreational Sports has been partnering with the fair since 2009. The only costs to students and faculty to attend Saturday are food, transportation and anything else they’d like to purchase while there. Tickets are available until Friday afternoon on the Recreational Sports website.
Over 800 student groups have been invited to attend the fair, including from Greek organizations and international student groups, and there will be a parade featuring student groups.
“What we’re trying to do is to integrate a whole lot of different types of people through a common bond of going off campus and having a fun experience,” said Michael Munson, associate director of Recreational Sports.
Kimaya Karnawat, a sophomore majoring in business administration, plans to attend with friends.
“We’re all fairly new to the L.A. area, so it’ll be a really cool experience,” she said. “I’m just looking forward to going with my friends, having a good time, relaxing and taking time off from schoolwork to have fun.”
Events at the fair include cooking contests, circus performances, carnival rides and pig races. Each year on USC day, a pig is dressed in a USC bib and cheered on by USC students, faculty and alumni in the race. There will also be a viewing party for the football game against Boston College with USC Spirit Leaders present.
“People can come and watch the entire game, or they can go out and do stuff at the fair and then come back. The viewing party is really the one central meeting place for all Trojans,” Munson said.
Natasha Simone, a sophomore majoring in theatre, is planning to attend the fair this weekend.
“I’ve only been to little pop-up fairs on the street, but I’ve never actually been to the full L.A. County Fair,” Simone said. “Basically, if there’s a Ferris wheel, I’ll be extremely happy. I’m just planning to have a good time with my girlfriends.”
On Saturday, the fair will close with an End of Summer Concert Series performance by R5 featuring Ryland Lynch, which begins at 7:30 p.m. The concert is included in the admission ticket.
Students who register online by the Friday deadline will receive an electronic coupon from Recreational Sports that will allow them to enter the fair. Non-USC guests can receive discounted $11 tickets through the county fair website with a USC promotional code.
Those who registered on time also have the option of purchasing bus transportation leaving from the Lyon Center. Additionally, seating might be available on the day of the event on a first-come, first-served basis. The cost to ride the bus is $10 per student. It departs at 3 p.m. and will return to campus after the concert on Saturday, around 10:30 p.m.
The fair runs until Sept. 28 this year. Normal admission for adults is $19 on the weekends and $12 on weekdays. Information about the event can also be found on the USC Day at the L.A. County Fair 2014 Facebook page.

This weekend, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena will be hosting the annual Care Harbor free health care clinic.
In partnership with L.A. Care, Care Harbor aims to turn free clinics into a gateway for patients to find sustainable care rather than  one-time treatment.
Guardian angel · Care Harbor has provided more than 43,000 medical, dental and vision services for free over the past three years. – Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
 
“This is not band-aid care,” said Care Harbor President Don Manelli.
The event started Thursday and will run until Sunday, with varying hours over the weekend. As of Thursday, 4,000 wristbands had been distributed, a substantial increase from the approximately 3,000 patients who received services last year.
Over the past three years, Care Harbor has provided medical, dental and vision services 43,822 times and nearly 3,000 patients have been connected with follow-up care.
Los Angeles County supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, one of the sponsors of the event, gave a statement to the press on Thursday morning.
“I believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege,” Ridley-Thomas said in a statement.
L.A. Care CEO Howard Kahn said that 1-1.3 million people in Los Angeles County still do not have healthcare coverage.
Though it is a temporary setup in a sports arena, the Care Harbor clinic features key medical equipment, including four electrocardiogram machines, an ultrasound system for gynecology services and an oral cancer screen system that uses fluorescent signal technology to detect human papillomavirus.
A new section is the preventive dentistry station, where clinic patients learn habits to prevent common oral diseases. Manelli estimated that nearly 90 percent of dental problems they see are preventable with certain lifestyle changes.
Clinic patients can also make appointments for different types of services at various times to avoid waiting around the arena all day.
Through discussing progress for the clinic and ways to improve for the future, Care Harbor is hoping to implement larger-scale health care reform.
“Our dream is that this would be totally unnecessary,” Manelli said.

A landscape architect and lecturer at the School of Architecture, Esther Margulies, is working on a plan to restore the Los Angeles River and build an artistic and cultural hub for the city.
The L.A. River Public Art Project proposal is a plan to make the L.A. River a vehicle for improving the education and well-being of adjacent communities while bringing a linear arts and culture resource to the city.
Margulies is working in collaboration with her former student Jean Yang, an alumna of the School of Architecture, as well as with two architects and a graphic designer. The Los Angeles Nomadic Division, a nonprofit dedicated to public art exhibitions, is also working with the team.
Their project aims to develop the 11-mile portion of the river that connects Griffith Park with downtown Los Angeles.
“People have been talking about the river for years and years and years, and I think there’s a reason why they are, because it’s a huge wasted opportunity,” Yang said.
She said that Los Angeles could emulate other urban landscapes across the country.
“When you think about great urban expanses, you think of running along the Charles River in Boston, and the Hudson River in New York, and biking along it and experiencing it,” Yang said. “I think [this plan] adds a new layer to what the L.A. urban experience could be that really wonderful cities like Chicago and [New York City] have already tapped into, something that we’re missing.”
The L.A. River Public Art Project proposal is currently competing for a $100,000 grant from LA2050, a development initiative dedicated to improving the Los Angeles area. According to LA2050, Los Angeles has the highest concentration of working artists and arts professionals in the United States.
The team is garnering support for the L.A. River Public Art Project from alumni and professional organizations, as well as continuing their social media campaigns. As of press time, the proposal is currently in 25th place for its category. Margulies hopes they will win when the competition for the grant ends on Sept. 16.
“L.A. will eventually be passed by in terms of long-term recognition and vitality if it doesn’t consolidate its artistic production quality with lasting infrastructure,” Michael Govan, CEO and Director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, told LA2050.
Thie L.A. River Public Art Project proposal, launched in late May of this year, aims to provide a framework of opportunities for residents along the river and for arts institutes nearby.
According to the project team’s research, a high school diploma is the highest form of education received by about 52 percent of citizens along the L.A. River. Margulies sees this proposal as an opportunity to improve student achievement in science and technology with their new access to nature and the arts.
In 2006, Los Angeles and the federal government initiated a master plan for a 32-mile stretch of the L.A. River, but later narrowed their focus to the 11-mile section that connects Griffith Park and Downtown LA. Though this portion of the river has been studied by the U.S. Army Corps, the Army’s plans are geared towards flood control, habitat restoration and passive recreation.
Margulies hopes to focus on other benefits the river has to offer, such as artistic development.
“The funding that will fund the Army Corps projects cannot address issues of culture and art, that’s why we wanted to start this project,” she said. “It would be nice, as the river gets done, to build a curated arts and culture plan to go with it.”
Besides creating opportunities for work force development, Margulies said that the L.A. River Project would emphasize the importance of the arts in educational neighborhood programs.
“[The plan] provides a framework and will define opportunities for local organization, arts institutions and residents to develop programming, education programs and potentially visual art,” she said. “But everyone will have a common vision.”

After starting the season with three wins — including a 2-1 victory over then-No. 9 Notre Dame — and a tie in four road games, the USC women’s soccer team returned to Los Angeles last Friday, Sept. 5 for its first home game of the season at McAlister Field against UC Riverside (2-1-1).
Hat trick · Senior midfielder Alex Quincey was one of two USC players to record three goals in the team’s home opener against UC Riverside. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
In a triumphant homecoming, USC’s offense exploded en route to an 8-1 victory. The game featured two hat tricks for the Women of Troy from junior midfielder Jamie Fink and senior midfielder Alex Quincey, and a memorable long-distance goal from junior forward Megan Borman.
The dual hat tricks by Fink and Quincey mark the first time in program history that two players have scored three goals each in the same game. The game was especially meaningful for Quincey, who played for UC Riverside before transferring to USC in her sophomore year.
“Coming off two great wins on the road, everyone on the team was excited to finally play at home, in front of the home crowd,” Quincey said. “To have two hat tricks and win 8-1 was a great way to come out and put on a show for the home crowd.”
The win marked the first home victory at USC for head coach Keidane McAlpine, who was hired from Washington State this past offseason and has the Women of Troy off to their best start since 2000, a year in which the program began the season 5-0.
With the home opener in the books, the Women of Troy now turn their focus toward another matchup at McAlister Field this Friday against the Pacific Tigers before heading to UC Irvine for a Sunday night showdown with the Anteaters. Both teams currently sit at 2-4, although UC Irvine has played some stiff competition thus far in Santa Clara, UCLA and Auburn, all road games.
With no game played this past Sunday, the Women of Troy will enter Friday’s game having had a full week off. The extra time off should allow for any ailments to heal up.
“Rest is big,” McAlpine said. “You need to make sure you properly balance the rest and training in order to keep a high level throughout an entire season. Having an extra day or two will help to keep our bodies fresh and our minds focused.”
Though the team was able to take a couple days off this week, on the days in which it did practice, it was business as usual.
“On days we do train, it’s hard and at full tempo,” McAlpine said.
The Women of Troy will look to use these next two games to continue their preparation for the Pac-12 season, which begins for the team on Friday, Sept. 26 at Arizona.
“Every game is preparing us for the Pac-12 Conference,” Fink said. “We are taking every game step-by-step and trying to improve and progress.”
Though the Women of Troy have progressed very well thus far, the team knows that it is still far from where it wants to be. Their goal for this weekend is clear: to shut out the opponent for an entire game.
“We have definitely been focusing more on attacking in practice,” Fink said. “Our next step will be to focus more on the back line and post a shutout for the entire game.”
This is a statement that Coach McAlpine has echoed as well, as both coach and players alike are aware of the jump in intensity that accompanies the switch from non-conference games to the conference schedule.
Ultimately, the bottom line for the Women of Troy is so far, so good. It is a long season, however, and the team knows that it still has many hurdles to jump if it is to make it back to the NCAA Tournament.
“What’s really been a positive in the games we have played thus far is that we have had a lot of players having success and a lot of players getting minutes,” Quincey said. “Now we need to hunker down and focus on the rest of the season, starting with Pacific on Friday.”
The game against the Tigers is set to kick off at 3 p.m. PDT on Friday at McAlister Field.

On Saturday, USC’s football team will play at Boston College. And, to be blunt, on Saturday, USC’s football team will probably beat Boston College.
But regardless of the outcome, something very important will happen Saturday night. The Boston College football team will honor former BC lacrosse player Welles Crowther, who was one of the approximately 3,000 people who lost their lives in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
If you had a chance to see the ESPN feature on Crowther, you know the story. If not, here goes:
Crowther, who graduated from Boston College in 1999 and got a job in equities trading in the South World Trade Center tower, helped approximately a dozen people reach safety before the tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001, with him inside. His body was discovered six months after the tragic events.
Crowther was known for always wearing a red bandana inside his lacrosse helmet at BC or in his pocket when he wasn’t playing, and was wearing it the day he died. This habit earned him the nickname “The Man in the Red Bandana.”
To honor him near the 13-year anniversary of his death, the Boston College football team will wear custom cleats, socks, gloves and helmets with a red paisley pattern on them to represent Crowther’s iconic red bandana. BC’s live eagle mascot, named Welles, will make an appearance at the school’s pre-game fanfest, and the university will host Crowther’s family and celebrate Boston College’s mission of producing “men and women for others.”
For a fleeting moment here at USC, we thought we knew something about heroes. When we heard the initial story about Josh Shaw spraining his ankles by jumping off a balcony in order to save his nephew from drowning, we all lauded his actions and insisted that it was the Trojan way. When we found out that he fabricated the heroic story, we were all crushed, and, unfortunately for us students, it reflected poorly on the entire university.
But Crowther is a real hero, in every sense of the word, and he deserves to be honored for his brave deeds.
I never thought I’d write a column about an alumnus of the school we were about to play (and hopefully demolish) the next day. So far I’ve stuck to USC football — it’s what I know best. But I wanted to share the story of Welles Crowther’s heroism with USC students who might not have heard it before or who might wonder why the maroon and gold Eagles were wearing bright red paisley patterns on their helmets this Saturday.
I’d say that our football fans are generally pleasant and respectful (alumni, at least), but USC students are often quite uninformed and obnoxious. (Yes, clamoring about how many Heisman trophies USC has won while walking past opposing fans on the way to the Coliseum and then leaving after just one quarter is about as obnoxious as it gets.)
Football fans can be so atrocious to each other, and students especially turn to tearing the other team down. I’ll admit I participated in a few anti-Stanford chants last Saturday (But not the “’SC rejects’” one because, if we’re being honest, that’s just a preposterous claim.)
I know that I sound really unspirited right now and people might just crumple up this column, throw it at their TV when BC scores its first touchdown this weekend, and continue to find ways to make fun of the Eagles.
But think back to our first home game, when we held a moment of silence for former Trojan track star and American soldier Louis Zamperini, who passed away this summer. Think of how proud we all are to have alumni like Zamperini and Neil Armstrong and how people look past their anti-USC sentiments to respect them as well.
It’s times like that when sports fans can come together to celebrate something larger than the football game at hand. And the anniversary of Sept. 11 is just the occasion to do that.
If you’re heading to Boston for the game or if you’re watching the game at home, maybe you could dig up a red bandana and don it to honor Crowther and the rest of the Americans who lost their lives on Sept. 11.
I hope that by writing this I stop at least a handful of USC students from turning to their friends this Saturday and ignorantly asking, “Why are they wearing those stupid uniforms?”
Save that question for Oregon.

The USC football team is aiming to avoid a letdown as it travels across the country to face Boston College on Saturday. The No. 9 Trojans (2-0, 1-0 Pac-12) jumped five spots in the AP Poll after their stunning win over Stanford, but will be embarking on a decidedly longer road trip this weekend — the team’s first to the East Coast since a 2012 matchup at Syracuse. Even with the long flight and next week’s bye in mind, head coach Steve Sarkisian is not worried about the Trojans’ mindset.
Good memories · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler was named USC’s starting quarterback in the week leading up to last year’s game against Boston College. Kessler threw for 237 yards in a 35-7 win. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
“[The late start time] allows us to get a little extra rest, which, when you’re traveling back-to-back weeks, is helpful,” Sarkisian said. “Traveling on Thursday is helpful as well, we can get there and get a little bit more acclimated. All in all, I think we’ll be fine.”
The Eagles (1-1, 0-1 ACC) visited USC in the tumultuous final days of the Lane Kiffin era last season, falling 35-7 as then-redshirt sophomore Cody Kessler played his first game as the Trojans’ sole starting quarterback. Kessler threw for 237 yards and two touchdowns, while a dominant effort from USC’s front seven held future NFL running back Andre Williams to just 38 yards on 17 carries.
This year’s Eagles squad has struggled without Williams, following up an uninspiring win over Massachusetts in its opening game with a 10-point conference loss to Pittsburgh last week. Still, the team’s rushing attack has remained strong behind the versatility of dual-threat quarterback Tyler Murphy. Murphy is averaging 7.2 yards per carry in 29 attempts so far this year, good for 210 yards and two touchdowns. Sarkisian praised the Eagles’ ability to provide varied offensive looks.
“One of the unique strengths of their system is they give you a lot of stuff,” Sarkisian said. “They give you multiple personnel groupings, they give you just about every shift, motion, formation that we can think of, and they have an athletic quarterback to do all that stuff.”
The USC defensive front will attempt to emulate Pittsburgh’s success without senior inside linebacker Hayes Pullard, who is suspended for the first half of the game. Pullard has racked up 16 total tackles so far this season, second only to junior defensive end Leonard Williams’ 18. Pullard’s direct replacement, sophomore Michael Hutchings, and redshirt junior Anthony Sarao will have to pick up the slack at the center of the Trojan defense.
“It’s about adversity,” Sarao told Trojans Live. “Like once [Pullard] left the field, it hit just hit me emotionally. It fired me up and I got real emotional, and me and Leonard [Williams] rallied the troops and that was really it.”
Though Boston College has found success running the football, stopping the run has been a completely different story. Pittsburgh running back James Conner had his way with the Eagles last week, finishing with 214 of the Panthers’ 303 rushing yards. USC’s up-tempo ground game will once again be driven by sophomore tailback Justin Davis and redshirt junior Javorius “Buck” Allen, who picked up a career-high 154 yards against Stanford. Redshirt junior Tre Madden led the team with 102 yards and a score in last year’s win over the Eagles, but has been slowly moving up the depth chart while recovering from a toe injury.
Murphy’s success through the air has been limited, welcome news to the USC secondary. The unit looked utterly lost for large portions of the Stanford game, allowing the Cardinal’s Kevin Hogan to pass for 285 yards on 22 completions, numbers that were deflated by Stanford’s ineptitude in the redzone. One strategy that USC may use to improve its play in the defensive backfield is giving more reps to two-way freshmen Adoree’ Jackson, who saw time at cornerback and wide receiver last week.
“He’s one of our best cover guys,” defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox said of Jackson. “We’re going to continue to push him, and he hasn’t shown us any reason not to. That doesn’t mean he’s perfect, he’s gotta continue to get better too, but we’re not scaling back.”
For his part, Jackson is still adjusting to the college game.
“It still hasn’t hit me really that I’m playing college football,” Jackson told the LA Daily News. “It was crazy … It was a fight for the ball [against Stanford’s receivers]. It was just two athletes fighting for the ball.”
The weather is adding an interesting wrinkle to Saturday’s game; forecasts are showing a chance of rain in the Boston area this weekend. Sarkisian, who coached in at Washington for five years, is not worried about the elements.
“I miss the rain,” Sarkisian said. “We’re fine. These guys have played in it before … it can be another piece of adversity that we can overcome.”
USC leads the all-time series against the Eagles 4-0. The teams played a home-and-home series in 1987-88, and met again in the 2009 Emerald Bowl. This game will kick off at 5 p.m. PST and can be viewed on ESPN.

No other serial killer has infected our collective unconscious quite like Jack the Ripper. He is history’s resident boogeyman, a nameless, faceless ghoul who stalked the street corners around London’s Whitechapel District from 1888 until roughly 1891, murdering and mutilating at least five women, most of them prostitutes, before receding into the fog of myth. The strange and terrible nature of his crimes, coupled with the fact that he never answered for them, caused the Ripper’s legend to endure, spawning a century’s worth of books, films and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of conspiracy theories ranging from Masonic blood sacrifices to the direct involvement of the royal family.
You Don’t Know Jack · Russell Edwards, who claims to have uncovered the identity of the real Jack the Ripper, says From Hell, a 2001 film starring Johnny Depp, inspired him to reopen the investigation. – Photo courtesy of 20th Century Fox
 
Last weekend, however, there was an apparent break in the 126-year-old case, and an article published by The Daily Mail suggested the notorious killer had been identified as Aaron Kosminski, a Polish-Jewish immigrant who was working as a barber in Whitechapel at the time of the murders, thanks to mitochondrial DNA evidence found on a blood and semen-stained shawl allegedly belonging to Catherine Eddowes, one of the Ripper’s later victims, who also lost her left kidney to the fiend. The shawl, reportedly stolen from the crime scene by a Victorian policeman as a gross-out gift for his wife, is currently in the possession of businessman and self-described “armchair detective” Russell Edwards, whose book, Naming Jack the Ripper, conveniently hit shelves earlier this week.
Edwards’s announcement, based on the findings of Liverpool John Moores University molecular biologist Dr. Jari Louhelainen, quickly raised the hackles of skeptics and “Ripperologists,” who have plenty of reasons to be suspicious of this supposed breakthrough. In 2002, there was a similar uproar over Patricia Cornwell’s book Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper — Case Closed, which used DNA found on the postage stamp of one of the Ripper’s alleged letters to the police as evidence that British painter Walter Sickert was in fact the murderer. Then there’s the shawl itself, which could easily be tainted with other people’s DNA — and that’s if it’s the genuine article to begin with. Besides, even if Kosminski was one of Eddowe’s clients, that doesn’t necessarily mean he was her killer.
To be frank, the truth of Kosminski’s guilt counts for very little now. It doesn’t matter who the Ripper really was. What matters is the power the character continues to exert on the public imagination through the realm of fiction, particularly literature and cinema. Edwards’s interest in the case, for instance, was piqued by the 2001 movie From Hell, starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham, which was an extremely loose adaptation of Alan Moore’s celebrated 1989 graphic novel of the same name, which itself was inspired by Steven Knight’s 1976 book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution.
The Ripper has been with us for the better part of 12 decades now, but he seems most at home in film, where the joys, fears and neuroses of our culture are offered up in flickering microcosm, a shadow play of ancient truths, prescient wonders and terrors older than time.
Along with Alfred Hitchcock’s The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog, one of the earliest and best-known portrayals of the Whitechapel killer can be found in G.W. Pabst’s 1929 silent melodrama Pandora’s Box, the Austrian director’s first collaboration with Louise Brooks, a cat-eyed Kansas waif whose wild girl facade belied hidden reservoirs of acting talent. The film features Brooks as Lulu, a career temptress whose reckless sexual escapades drive her to murder in Germany, fugitivism in Egypt and prostitution in London, ultimately leading to a fatal third-act encounter with the Ripper (Gustav Diessl). Lulu’s final scene, cast in a veil of shadow and fed on the horror of the implicit, is an unqualified triumph of expressionist cinematography, the kind engineered to produce nightmares.
The character has also proven himself surprisingly malleable, appearing in everything from the crackerjack sci-fi comedy Time After Time, where the Ripper (David Warner) hijacks H.G. Wells’ time machine and runs amok in modern-day San Francisco while the author himself (Malcolm McDowell) gives chase, to no less than two separate Sherlock Holmes adventures.
The first of these, 1965’s slapdash but spirited A Study in Terror, pits the Great Detective (John Neville) and Dr. Watson (Donald Houston) against the insane Duke of Shires (Barry Jones), who triggers the Ripper killings after his son falls in love with a beautiful prostitute. Bob Clark’s far-superior Murder by Decree, starring Christopher Plummer as Holmes and James Mason as Watson, expands on the theories put forth in Knight’s book and embraces a far-reaching Masonic conspiracy surrounding royal physician and real-life Ripper suspect Sir William Gull. The latter film is buoyed by Clark’s sharp directorial instincts, which he would soon put to even better use in A Christmas Story, and the chummy banter between Plummer and Mason.
So what is it about the Ripper that still intrigues us? Why does he continually bleed into our art? Why does his shadow loom so large over the last century? Morbid curiosity simply isn’t enough to explain the public’s ongoing fascination with the Whitechapel murders. Some point to the character as the embodiment of the social ills — for Victorian England, it was crushing poverty and neglect — that plague every time period in one form or another. Others see him as a perversely romantic figure who could only love through violence. Even if we close our eyes and refuse to see him at all, he’ll still be out there, the invisible monster, the chaos peddler, the black hole in our cultural firmament.
Aaron Kosminski, who suffered from auditory hallucinations commonly associated with paranoid schizophrenia, died in a mental asylum in 1919. He only weighed 96 pounds at the time of his death. His victims, assuming they really were his, have all been cried over and buried. But there’s something in human nature that abhors a neatly solved mystery, especially one that ends with such a plausible, garden-variety culprit. It’s the same reason many viewers were left unsatisfied when Cthulhu didn’t show up in the True Detective finale. Maybe part of us would prefer a monster. When it’s just a man, the world feels like a far more sinister place.

Big Sugar Bakeshop, a Studio City bakery specializing in updated versions of classic American desserts, opened its second location in downtown on Sept. 2. The quaint bakery prides itself on making all of its treats in small batches using high-quality ingredients.
The Sweet Life ·Cupcake flavors at Big Sugar Bakeshop vary from old favorites like vanilla and red velvet to the more exotic Dulce de Leche and Cinammon with cocoa. Big Sugar also offers a doughnut muffin. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
Cupcakes anchor the menu at Big Sugar, from traditional flavors such as vanilla and red velvet to more eccentric options including dulce de leche and cinnamon with cocoa. The icebox cupcake — tender chocolate cake filled with whipped cream and dunked in a glossy chocolate ganache — is a creative riff on the retro dessert. The coconut cupcake is delicate and flavorful, crowned with a generous smear of coconut-infused cream cheese frosting and wispy coconut shavings.
The doughnut muffin, a hybrid between two ubiquitous baked goods, is another signature item. Big Sugar uses a basic doughnut batter for the petite breakfast pastry, which is baked rather than fried, then rolled in butter and cinnamon-sugar while still warm.
Dense and deeply chocolatey, the salted caramel brownie will satisfy even the most demanding sweet tooth. The brownie contains a gooey sliver of salted caramel and a sprinkle of coarse sugar on top, creating an ideal balance of salty and sweet.
In addition to the main menu, several items rotate based on seasonal availability of produce. Named “Best Apple Dessert” by Food & Wine in 2008, the apple pie bar contains caramelized apples nestled atop a crisp, buttery shortbread crust. To accompany the baked goods, Big Sugar serves Groundwork coffee and espresso drinks.
The shop’s decor is homey and inviting, featuring display shelves stocked with a variety of cookbooks, kitchen accessories and vintage knick knacks. “With one stop, you can find the perfect cake, card and gift to make the most of any party,” Big Sugar’s website explains. Whether to answer questions about ingredients or to help you assemble a festive gift basket, the friendly and knowledgeable staff makes customers feel at ease.
While the store does not offer seating, the sprawling courtyard of the City National Plaza is just a short walk away. All of Big Sugar’s portion sizes are quite generous, making the bakery an ideal destination to enjoy with friends, either for a quick breakfast or an afternoon snack.
For students on a budget, the menu items are reasonably priced yet made using top-notch ingredients. All of the cupcakes are $2.95, while the sizable cookies are a steal for only $1 each. At $3.25, the brownies and bar cookies are on the more expensive side, but can easily be split between two people.
An added bonus, the bakery is just three stops away on the Metro Expo Line, eliminating the hassle of paying for parking. For students and business people alike, Big Sugar’s handmade baked goods, welcoming ambience and attentive service provide a sweet oasis from the hustle and bustle of the Financial District.
 
Big Sugar Bakeshop is located at 612 S. Flower Street. Open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Closed Sundays.

For Congress, it is rare for the mere act of voting to become more significant than the outcome of that vote. If the United States is to take significant military action against the Islamic State, they must do so with authorization from Congress. To allow anything else, including the unbridled and open-ended conflict that President Obama outlined in a speech to the nation on Wednesday night, sets a dangerous and unconstitutional precedent very far from the ideals upon which our nation was founded.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
 
Obama announced air strikes in Syria and a more comprehensive bombing campaign in Iraq in an effort to “degrade and ultimately destroy” the movement that has taken over most of southern Syria and northern Iraq, and resulted in the beheading of two American journalists in the last month. Obama and White House officials have claimed that the new bombing campaign in Syria is constitutional and requires no Congressional approval, because of the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). That’s right: A session of Congress 13 years ago authorized military action today against a movement they didn’t even know existed.
How strange does that sound?
The history of war powers is complex. When Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973, they did not intend to end executive war powers, but rather to require Congressional approval after a certain time — 60 days. Clinton questionably violated the act in 1999 with the Bosnia invasion, but post-9/11, a new era of executive action was born. Congress passed the 2001 AUMF, which the Supreme Court has validated as giving broad powers to the executive to wage war outside of Congress. The AUMF, however, specifically gives the executive the authority to use force against those who “planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons.”
It’s a slippery slope. The Islamic State’s leaders have broken from Al Qaeda in Pakistan, and little (if any) evidence has been shown to link them to the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks. The Obama administration’s reasoning on ISIS sounds a lot like the Bush administration’s reasoning in the 2003 pre-Iraq invasion. There is a lot of talk, and little evidence. Déjà vu?
It’s time for all of that to end. Congress showed signs of life when it took a stand on Obama’s request to use force in Libya in 2011 by voting to cut funding for the operation, but that will be for naught if representatives remain silent on action in the Middle East, which has no timetable to describe the length of the mission. In fact, operations in Iraq since the ISIS invasion have already exceeded the 60-day limit.
Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, imperialist or isolationist, one thing that it is important to agree on is the need for Congress to, at the bare minimum, have a voice in this matter. This voice cannot be the one Obama has asked them to have — authorizing $500 million to train pro-western rebels in Syria — but a voice that either authorizes or rejects the entire mission in the first place.
Such a vote likely won’t come, but the conversation shouldn’t stop. In the next Congress, a serious look at repealing the 2001 AUMF is necessary. As we pass the 13th anniversary of 9/11, we should no longer rely on 14-year-old military authorizations to confront our enemies.
An executive unhampered by Congress could do far more damage in the coming century than the radical Islamic network of the year. Worse yet, for all his violations of the War Powers Act (which the AUMF cannot supersede), Obama’s leadership is the least of our problems — but an imperialist, militaristic president that the nation elects in the future might be.
“The AUMF is now nearly 12 years old,” said Obama at the National Defense University in May 2013. “Unless we discipline our thinking, our definitions, our actions, we may be drawn into more wars we don’t need to fight, or continue to grant presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states.”
That wasn’t a Congressman, a general or even a civilian speaking. That was President Obama one year ago. And if Obama — who has overseen a massive drone program and the reintroduction of force into Iraq — is worried about a future executive abusing the power, maybe we should be, too.

Even when Obama tries to muster all his strength and courage – when it comes to military action – you can tell he is scared and un-sure of himself. It is too bad he started his Presidency with an Apology Tour and tried to make friends with the very people he is claiming he will kill today. Obama does not have any idea how to lead in foreign afairs – he just wants to be the guy the entire world loves and he wants to be the “Anti-George Bush”. Unfortunately for him – he is discovering that when you assume the responsibilities of the President – you can not just try and be the cool guy everyone loves – you actually have to make adult decisions and it is not all pixie dust and good vibes…
I am still trying to understand how exactly ISIS is a threat to the USA. ISIS is in the middle of an attempt to recreate the Ottoman Empire, the Persian Empire, the Roman Empire, the Egyptian Empire or something like that. This region has been in constant conflict since the beginning of recorded history. Sending US forces or weapons or money to the region is a waste of tax dollars.

Though Disney and electronic music D.J. Deadmau5 seem to have little in common, the two entities are facing off in a legal battle. The creators of Mickey Mouse are filing a trademark lawsuit against the musician for his signature ears, which they allege resemble those of Mickey Mouse too closely. Disney wants to prevent the performer Deadmau5, whose real name is Joel Thomas Zimmerman, from trademarking the image he has been using for over a decade.  Though all original work deserves respect, Deadmau5’s ears are not a threat to Disney’s favorite mouse. They more closely resemble a parody, or social critique of Mickey Mouse, and his right to use the ears should be protected. The costume is a signature of his performance persona and an extension of his freedom of expression.
According to the Daily Beast, Disney is no stranger to the issue of copyright, reporting that “[the corporation] gained a reputation as the world’s largest copyright enforcer (some would say copyright troll),” and has ample resources to fund legal disputes. In fact, Disney prominently backed the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which was passed in 1998. This law automatically and retroactively extended copyright and prevented these icons from passing into the public domain. In other words, this law allowed Disney to keep Mickey Mouse under copyright.
Despite the resemblance between Mickey’s ears and Deadmau5’s performance costume, his use of the ears is not a threat to Disney and does not directly infringe upon their copyrighted character. Copyright infringement becomes an issue of integrity and economic gain when consumers mistake the knock-off for the original version. For instance, purse or shoe manufacturers might take brand name logos with the intent to deceive consumers and make a profit. In this case, it is clear that copyright law should be enforced and upheld.
This case between Disney and Deadmau5, however, is not so clear-cut. While it makes sense that Disney might not want to be associated with the electronic music D.J., this situation begs the question as to whether any consumer would conflate the two images. Unlike the knock-off purse example, Deadmau5 is not claiming to be Mickey Mouse or trying to associate himself with Disney for economic gain. In fact, it seems he is attempting to do just the opposite. Deadmau5’s use of “Mickey Mouse” ears could be viewed as ironic — it is more of a social critique than an attempt to impersonate Mickey.
In this instance, Deadmau5’s costume falls under the protection of fair use law. According to the Stanford Copyright and Fair Use website, “a fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and ‘transformative’ purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner.” Fair use laws allow people the freedom to make social critiques and parodies of otherwise copyrighted material without legal repercussions. Fair use laws protect parodists, such as musician Weird Al Yankovic, to allow artistic expression.
Just as Weird Al uses the First Amendment, freedom of speech and fair use to defend his work, Deadmau5’s ears should be subject to the same legal protection. Even though Deadmau5’s ears are a silent comment on Disney’s favorite mouse, his right to use them should be upheld. The ears are a signature part of his performance persona and only evoke Disney in an ironic way. His use of “Mickey Mouse” ears adds a layer of satire to his performances and is integral to artistic expression.
As Daily Beast writer Jay Michaelson  asks, “Are all mice with round heads and ears copyrighted by Disney?” Michaelson suggests that Disney may have gone a step too far by targeting Deadmau5 and adds that not all copyright infringement is negative. While this may seem paradoxical, Andrew Leonard, staff writer at Salon, suggests Disney benefitted from the explosion of parody videos based on the movie Frozen. According to the Wall Street Journal, there are over 60,000 fan-made versions of Frozen’s “Let It Go,” which have been viewed more than 60 million times. Even though these parodied versions do not directly increase Disney’s bottom line, evidence suggests that they draw attention to the original.
While it is doubtful that Deadmau5’s ears will encourage electronic music fans to purchase Mickey Mouse related merchandise, this example reinforces the idea that copyright infringement is an ambiguous issue. Disney owns every right to claim Mickey Mouse as its own, but this should not prevent artists from using similar images. Deadmau5’s signature ears should be protected under fair use and freedom of expression, without a squeak of discontent from Disney.
 
you appear to be dismissing a trademark lawsuit using copyright arguments. i don’t think disney is making any copyright infringement claims.
