It’s the time of year where new releases are few and far between. Awards season has saturated the box office with Oscar nominees and critically acclaimed films. Movies like Frozen, American Hustle and The Wolf of Wall Street have accumulated large audiences over the past few weeks.
In stark contrast to last weekend’s release of I, Frankenstein, this weekend has has female-targeted releases of Labor Day and That Awkward Moment.
Labor Day, starring Josh Brolin and Kate Winslet, is the tale of a convict taken in by a single mother and her child. Its major themes include morality and the nature of love. The two leads are both very well established and talented actors, and critics have already noted both actors deliver quality performances. The film emphasizes romanticism more than sexuality, earning the film its PG-13 rating.
That Awkward Moment plays to a much younger demographic, starring Zac Efron, Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller as three best friends who promise to stay out of relationships together.  While it loosely follows the format of a romantic comedy, it plays out a bit more like a “bromantic comedy,” peppering raunchy jokes into a romantic comedy-esque storyline. The film will most likely cater to a female demographic over Super Bowl weekend.
How well they actually perform will most likely come down to marketing.
Labor Day was first released in December to a limited audience, attempting to gain momentum through word of mouth. While the film has received generally positive reviews, it has not achieved the critical acclaim to dominate the box office.
That Awkward Moment has turned to social media to draw interest. With promotional clips, teasers and trailers garnering massive amounts of YouTube views, marketing has played into the younger generation’s reliance on social media to generate an audience for the R-rated comedy, solidifying its presence in the minds of moviegoers.
But neither film has what it takes to dominate the box office this weekend. Ride Along, the Kevin Hart and Ice Cube action-comedy, will likely spend its third consecutive week at No. 1.

Thank goodness Friday has arrived – treat yourself to something sugary. You  deserve it.
I am an advocate of sweets; whether that includes ice cream, cupcakes, soufflés, pudding, fruit, macarons or cookies, I believe that everyone should allow himself or herself to have dessert. It’s the beginning of the year, so like myself, many people have started diets and workout regimens to look great for spring break – but we cannot limit our happiness. That joy, in my opinion, stems from having sugar in our bodies, like eating cookies.

For those who know me, aside from having a sweet tooth, I take care of my body  by exercising and eating right – dessert is the ultimate prize. I look at dessert as my little reward for a hard day’s work. Of course, I try not to over do it, but sometimes one measly dessert is all you need to get some positive, feel-good energy to carry on – putting a cherry on top, if you will.
This inspired a little saying that I created, similar to another – “A cookie a day, keeps your heart in place.” With that, you allow yourself to splurge, just a little – no, this is not cheating, but self encouragement – but also can help you become a disciplined individual in regards to diet.
Not convinced? Here’s more.
Last semester, our football team fell into a rut. Thanks to a much needed coaching change, the season ended pretty well. But I also attribute this to diet.
When Coach O took over, players weren’t asked to eat less or to eat healthier. Instead, they were allowed to eat cookies. One of Coach O’s first changes was bringing back the dessert table, making players’ lives a whole lot sweeter – their stomachs were smiling, and thanking the football gods for existing.
Cookies are one of the best desserts. If you are at a social gathering and there happens to be a dessert bar, cookies make great leftovers and are compact enough to fit in your purse, pants pocket, jacket pocket, wallet and bra – I recommend using a napkin for clean purposes.
They are easy to make and can be frozen for extended periods of time, so if you don’t want to eat them all in one sitting, you can fit their compact little bodies into plastic bags and put them away for some hibernation.
Cookies serve many purposes. They make great gifts to friends, teachers, mentors, professors and loved ones. Cookies can be turned into breads – you read that correctly – and granolas. Not the healthiest of granolas, but it’ll give you a sweet parfait.
Cookies bring people together. Ever heard of holiday cookie swaps? Valentine’s Day is coming up, so single ladies, a cookie swap with the besties is an awesome idea.
One of my favorite cookie recipes covers the chocolate craving and the healthy side of life: Kim Boyce’s Whole Wheat Chocolate Chip Cookies. You can satisfy your sweet tooth without sacrificing your diet.
