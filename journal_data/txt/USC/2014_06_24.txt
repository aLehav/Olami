The USC Gould School of Law is implementing a new program next fall that will allow select students to complete their undergraduate and law school studies over the course of six years.
The program, known as 3+3, puts select students on a fast track toward law school. USC students interested in 3+3 can apply during their junior year and, upon acceptance, enroll in Gould during their senior year.
Their senior year would then consist of graduate studies, and at the end of that year, the students would earn their bachelor’s degree.
Following graduation, after two more years of law school, they would earn their law degree.
By participating in this program, students are not required to take the LSAT for admittance.
The program is open to applicants of all majors, but is quite selective. Students must have a minimum GPA of 3.8, as well as strong faculty recommendations and numerous writing samples.
Additionally, as students accepted into the program start their law school course load in their senior year, applicants must complete their major requirements by the end of their junior year.
Applications will be available starting September 1 for the fall 2015 semester.
Chloe Reid, associate dean for admissions and financial aid at Gould, told USC News that 3+3 is for the student who “know they want to pursuer a legal career from early in their education, and who are ready for graduate-level work in their senior year.”
The Dean of Gould, Robert K. Rasmussen, told USC News that the program is indicative of the law school’s continued innovation in their education methods.
“Law schools know that they need to be creative and forward thinking when it comes to legal education,” he said. “We are extremely excited to offer this program to Trojans who want to continue their academic careers here.
Then you can end up just like Andrew Carmichael! Google the LA Times story on this USC Law School grad. He was a prodigy who graduated college early. After USC law school, he ended up $215,000 in debt and went back to the computer job he had before law school. There isn’t much opportunity in the legal industry. I’m shocked people are still interested in attending law school. If you haven’t figured it out by now, the salary and job numbers offered by law schools are pure fantasy. Spend some time talking to a solo lawyer or a lawyer who works in a small firm (the vast majority of lawyers, btw). Ask them if they regret going to law school and how much they make. You’ll be shocked. You’ll also have to fight with tons of other law grads just for the chance to work in a small firm. Seriously, if you’re thinking about law school, you need to figure out a better plan for your life.

Research from the USC School of Pharmacy has found a potential new drug treatment for treating alcohol use disorder through using a common anti-parasitic medicine.
Trojan science · Ph.D Candidate Megan Yardley has been a member of the research team for five years and says human trials are “promising.” – Phillip Channing | USC News
 
The drug, ivermectin, has traditionally been used to treat parasitic infections in humans and animals.
The results of a five-year animal study by the school, however, reveal that it may be able to do more than just that.
Using mice, the research team discovered that giving 30 milligrams of ivermectin to the rodents reduced their alcohol intake, both in social drinking models and binge drinking models.
Megan Yardley, who will receive her Ph.D. from the School of Pharmacy this August, joined the research team when they first began animal studies five years ago.  She noted that the animal data has been very promising, and the FDA has approved the team to continue the research with human subjects.
“Everything is sort of lined up to start the human studies as soon as possible,” she said.
Yardley mentioned it is still too early to tell what the potential results will be from the human trials, but the possibilities of the drug will be clearer in the months to come.
“Hopefully in three months we’ll have a much better idea on how it works — whether it decreases cravings or the pleasurable effects people feel when they consume alcohol,” she said.
One of the team’s biggest apprehensions is the potential side effects of ivermectin when used on a regular basis. Currently, the drug is only taken a few times a year, but alcohol use disorder is a much more chronic issue and would need to be treated often.
“[Ivermectin] might open some doors, but again, we still have to do a lot more toxicology studies to make sure this chronic exposure to ivermectin isn’t going to be problematic,” Yardley said. “It seems really promising, and the human studies will be able to tell us a lot.”
Some of the promising attributes were that ivermectin doesn’t cause anxiety and doesn’t have rewarding properties — two characteristics that if existed, would be problematic to treating an alcoholic population.
If this treatment proves successful in humans, it could come as a welcome relief to the reported 18 million people in the United States who suffer from alcohol use disorders.
Statistics from the World Health Organization stated that there were 3.3 million deaths from alcohol consumption in 2012 alone.

USC is exploring the possibility of acquiring or merging with The Scripps Research Institute, a private biomedical research organization based in La Jolla.
The institute boasts several Nobel laureates and has played a key role in the development of treatments for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
“The University of Southern California (USC) and The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) are discussing the possibility of a relationship that would enhance the missions of both institutions,” Michael Marletta, President and Chief Executive Officer of TSRI, and Elizabeth Garrett, USC Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs said in a joint statement on June 17. “TSRI and USC have a shared commitment to academic excellence that will result in meaningful breakthroughs to improve health and well-being.”
Carl Marziali, USC Assistant Vice President of Media Relations, told the Daily Trojan that there have been no new developments with the proposed merger since the statement was released.
A private research organization, TSRI receives the bulk of their funding through federal grants from the National Institutes for Health and contracts with pharmaceutical companies who benefit from their research.
With federal funding dwindling, the institute would need to receive major private donations to remain financially sound. A collaboration with USC would give TSRI access to ample funds from USC’s $6 billion fundraising campaign, $3 billion of which has already been raised.
The San Diego Union-Tribune, the paper that first broke the story, reported that many employees at TSRI are disgruntled by the news of the proposed merger.
In an email to Marletta, ten department chairs and a dean expressed their concern about the merger, saying it would negatively impact the culture of the institute.
“[TSRI] is a singular source of biomedical advances and commercial efforts for the common good,” they wrote. “This singular success is an outgrowth of the culture at Scripps that nurtures ideas, risk-taking and scientific entrepreneurship, and a strong sense of collaboration and collegiality. We believe that the proposed path with USC would destroy much of what has been built and what we and others in the community value so much.”

The last few weeks have been rough for Star Wars fans. First the Expanded Universe novels, comics and video games were unceremoniously dropped from the official canon, then a barrage of leaked set photos threatened to pollute the air of mystery surrounding J.J. Abrams’ Episode VII and finally, as if to add injury to insult, Harrison Ford broke his leg when the Millennium Falcon’s door accidentally closed on him during filming at Pinewood Studios, forcing Abrams and company to adjust their shooting schedule without bumping the movie from its Dec. 18, 2015 release date.

Then, like an asthmatic cyborg hurling a senior citizen down an elevator shaft, a single action restored balance to the Force. In perhaps the most inspired industry move since Warner Bros. handed Christopher Nolan the keys to the Batmobile, Disney has tapped USC School of Cinematic Arts alumnus Rian Johnson, the acclaimed auteur behind Brick and Looper, to write and direct Star Wars Episode VIII, the second and reportedly darkest installment of the planned sequel trilogy. The 40-year-old filmmaker, B.A. Production ‘96, will also develop a treatment for Episode IX, which he might end up directing as well.
So what exactly does Johnson bring to the holochess table? Like Gareth Edwards and Josh Trank, the two directors Disney recently hired to lens a series of stand-alone Star Wars movies (each rumored to center on either Boba Fett, Han Solo or Yoda), Johnson is an artist whose projects tend to be clever without being cutesy, stylish without being shallow and self-aware without being self-absorbed. All three directors have had previous dalliances with blockbusters: Johnson hit critical and commercial pay dirt with Looper while Edwards followed up his micro-budgeted creature feature Monsters with this spring’s mostly well-received Godzilla and Trank used his Akira-in-suburbia superhero flick Chronicle as a springboard for tackling Fox’s forthcoming Fantastic Four reboot.
Johnson first made waves at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival with Brick, which transplanted the hardboiled affectations and contused worldview of Dashiell Hammett crime novels and the genre-splicing anime Cowboy Bebop into the mouths and minds of twenty-first century high school kids. The movie, a remarkably assured debut that followed a marble-mouthed teenage gumshoe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) investigating the murder of his estranged ex-girlfriend, quickly became a cult sensation, establishing Johnson as an out-of-the-box talent. His follow-up The Brothers Bloom, a middling caper comedy starring Adrien Brody and Mark Ruffalo as a pair of fraternal con artists, represented a bit of a sophomore slump, but he regained his mojo just in time to make 2012’s thrilling, refreshingly cerebral Looper.
Yet as impressive as Johnson’s film credits are, the true measure of his gifts can be taken by his contributions to the small screen, specifically AMC’s Breaking Bad. He directed three of the best episodes of the series, including the claustrophobic two-man show “Fly” — which found Walt (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse (Aaron Paul) butting heads and coming to grips with their increasingly Kafkaesque existence while searching their meth super-lab for an elusive contaminant — and the gut-wrenching, apocalyptic series climax “Ozymandias,” now universally regarded as one of the greatest episodes of television ever aired.
If Disney allows Johnson the same amount of creative leeway it’s shown Pixar and Marvel in the past, we could easily be looking at the most emotionally deep, character-driven Star Wars movie since 1980’s The Empire Strikes Back, which itself was directed by USC alumnus and former faculty member Irvin Kershner. Our university has always shared an inexorable bond with George Lucas’ beloved space opera, so it seems only fitting for another Trojan to help set the course of its future.

As hip-hop collectives go, there are few generating as much hype as Black Hippy, the Los Angeles-based outfit of Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Kendrick Lamar. Though his last official album release was 2012’s Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City, Kendrick Lamar remains rap’s poster child as the perfect union of respecting hip-hop’s eccentric traditionalism, employing next-level lyrical dexterity and having an uncanny ear for listenable production.

Schoolboy Q has fashioned a niche for himself as one of the most sought-after party rappers in recent memory, with hit singles such as “Man of the Year” and “Collard Greens” receiving heavy rotation on Top 40 radio stations. Jay Rock, who was the first member of the collective to be signed to a major label, is an underground icon in the Los Angeles hip-hop scene. His brief cameo in GKMC’s “Money Trees” was heralded as one of the best guest verses of 2012 by Complex magazine.
Which leaves us with Ab-Soul, the mysterious man who seems to always wear sunglasses and maintain a low profile. His latest release, These Days… hit iTunes on Tuesday amid relatively little fanfare for a Top Dawg Entertainment release. Ab-Soul has yet to fashion out a memorable identity for himself, and despite being on his third album with These Days…, Ab-Soul remains a bit of an enigma.
Ab-Soul’s persona is actually nothing new — dozens, if not hundreds, of underground rappers struggled to strike a strong balance between “getting a message across” and maintaining popular appeal to get them over into the mainstream. The Carson, California native clarifies “Ab-Soul, abstract, a—–le,” and These Days…, if nothing else, is abstract.
The woozy, reedy-voiced Ab-Soul bounces around broad concepts like outer space, ounces of marijuana and “fifty dollar drawers,” among other things, but fails to bring a requisite focus or message to the tracks. The album itself is akin to Ab-Soul’s musical persona, lacking any cohesion or specific direction, choosing instead to remain in a self-indulgent, exclusive brand of intelligence that seems to only make sense to the rapper and his closest, reefer-reeking fans. The tracks on These Days… oscillate between uninspired tropes about a drug-addled lifestyle like on “Twact,” or jarringly awkward treatises on falling in love with someone’s mind on “Sapio Sexual.”
It’s telling when an album’s strongest tracks involve other artists. In Ab-Soul’s case, he squanders the opportunity to exhibit versatility and instead is completely overwhelmed by stronger verses on his tracks. For example, “Hunnid Stax” chops a haunting vocal sample from Lana Del Rey and interpolates a menacing bass line. Soul borrows lines from — of all rappers — Big Sean while sounding consistently uncomfortable extolling the virtues of his newfound wealth. Guest rapper and labelmate Schoolboy Q, on the other hand, raps like he never left the studio for his latest effort Oxymoron. The South Central Los Angeles native sounds almost gleefully comfortable firing off some appallingly misogynistic lines. Content notwithstanding, the track is an absolute banger.
Unfortunately, tracks like “Hunnid Stax” are the exception and not the rule. Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar both sound in fine form and almost seem to sound better than usual when pitted against Ab-Soul’s self-indulgent abstractions. These Days… does little to improve perception that Ab-Soul is the odd man out in the group, and though Ab-Soul does have a credible stable of followers who appreciate his head-in-the-clouds approach to intellectualism, it’s hard to imagine any new followers latching on to the rapper’s latest effort.

USC’s athletic department announced on Monday that the school will offer four-year scholarships to student-athletes in revenue sports effective July 1.
Game changer · USC athletic director Pat Haden has been vocal in his pursuit of better conditions and benefits for student-athletes. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
This marks a shift from the former practice of offering one-year scholarships that can be renewed or reneged at the end of each year.
Under this new policy, which will apply to all current and future scholarship student-athletes in USC’s football, men’s basketball and women’s basketball programs, athletic director Pat Haden says “USC hopes to help lead the effort to refocus on student-athlete welfare on and off the field.”
USC is not the first institution to implement multi-year scholarships for student-athletes, though. The NCAA first allowed them to be offered in 2011, and programs such as Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State signed on quickly. Northwestern, a school recently in the limelight for allowing its student-athletes to form a union, offers four-year scholarships to all scholarship student-athletes, not just those in revenue-generating sports.
The news of USC’s policy change comes just two months after the NCAA announced that student-athletes could receive unlimited snacks and meals effective August 1. Prior to the decision, Division I athletes were afforded three meals a day or a stipend for food.
Haden has been very vocal about making changes to benefit student-athletes.
“While I always want to do as much as we can for our student-athletes, it is important to acknowledge how valuable the scholarship already is,” Haden noted in his monthly State of Troy announcement. “I am the perfect example. I could not have attended USC without a football scholarship, and my experience here built the foundation for my entire life. Football changed my life. USC changed my life.”
Haden’s decision to offer multi-year scholarships will likely have a positive impact on recruiting, especially following the recent end to the sanctions placed on the football and men’s basketball programs in 2010.
The four-year guarantee ensures that student-athletes cannot have their scholarships revoked at the end of each year due to injury, coaching changes or a poor athletic performance, which might provide peace of mind to many young players.
One notable high school recruit already sang USC’s praises for adopting this change.
Five-star defensive back Iman Marshall (Long Beach Poly) tweeted “USC is now offering four year scholarships to all student athletes in lieu of one year renewable scholarships, #GAMECHANGER!”
Marshall has received offers from USC, UCLA, LSU, Stanford, Michigan, Notre Dame and a number of other top football programs in the nation.
USC’s decision to offer multi-year scholarships comes in the middle of former UCLA basketball player Ed O’Bannon’s high-profile lawsuit against the NCAA regarding the rights to use student-athletes’ likenesses without them being compensated.
Though Haden has advocated for the welfare of student-athletes in many ways, he has come out publicly against the O’Bannon suit.
“In financial terms, it would cost every institution millions of dollars,” Haden said in his June 2014 State of Troy announcement. “Schools would have to set that money aside to pay student-athletes for the use of their likeness, which is the crux of the case. In order to do so, institutions would have to shave that money from their annual budget, which could lead to severe downsizing and even the elimination of some sports. No athletic director wants to have to make that decision.”
In the announcement, Haden also noted that USC remains committed to assisting student-athletes with receiving their degrees after their athletic eligibility runs out. More than 250 former Trojan student-athletes have returned to USC to finish their degrees over the last decade.

Driving Lamborghinis, poppin’ bottles, raining cash, showing off new Rolex watches and taking extravagant and exotic trips via private jets, “Rich Kids of Snapchat” has been gaining high publicity in the past few weeks by posting obnoxious snaps on Facebook. As of this morning, the Facebook group has reached more than 23K “likes,” and the number is only rapidly increasing.
Art by Mollie Berg
“Rich Kids” has a Snapchat account, RichKidSnap, that regularly updates “stories” and occasionally sends out snaps to individuals, while the Facebook account highlights the popular Snapchat stories to attract more likes and followers. The operator of the Rich Kids accounts claims on the Facebook page that they are “living the frat life” and that they are currently in Los Angeles. Yesterday, Rich Kids of Snapchat sent out a message on Snapchat, claiming that they’re coming to USC in the fall. Whether it was true or false, we could not be sure. But since president Nikias has recently been working to distance USC from the “University of Spoiled Children” and the party image, this could be a potential black mark for the university.
It seems that recently there’s been a growing trend in the entertainment world in which many social media personalities and reality television shows become popular through publicly displaying their wealth in obnoxious ways. “Rich Kids of Instagram” puts up images of spoiled rich kids showing off their lavish lives on Instagram and Tumblr. “Rich Kids of Beverly Hills” documents five wealthy young people in their 20s, living luxuriously in their material world without having any real problems that people their age normally face. The show seems to be quite a success, as E! is developing a spin-off for Season 2, called “Rich Kids of New York”. Meanwhile, the Kardashians have always been known for showcasing their prodigal lives in their reality show, and last Saturday probably marked the craziest “rich kid” activity we’ve seen, when Kim and Kanye threw a “Kidchella” party for their daughter’s first birthday. As the name suggests, it was Coachella for kids, and they incorporated Coachella events and designs such as stages, face-painting, hair-braiding, tie-dyed wristbands and the iconic Ferris wheel. The most ridiculous part was of course that the one-year-old girl had no idea what was happening and will not remember that day.
What amuses me about this trend is that these “rich kids” constantly receive condescending and negative comments, yet more of them are emerging as a result of growing popularity and publicity. There are countless reviews and commentaries criticizing or mocking these celebrities and social media users, and there are audiences and followers posting negative comments, indicating their frustration and even anger toward these rich personalities. Regardless of their annoyance, however, audiences, followers and the media stay tuned into the lives of these rich kids.
I couldn’t help but wonder about the rationale behind our obsession with spoiled, annoying rich people. Why is it that we hate the way they waste resources and complain about stupid things when there are people in the world suffering from real problems, but at the same time, we find pleasure looking at how absurd these rich people are? I think there are several explanations. Some of us enjoy it because we are jealous of these people, so we find it enticing to live the extravagant life through their experiences. Some of us may be curious to know what rich people do because we want to be one of them. Most of us, however, take pleasure in keeping up with these rich people because it somehow makes us feel better about ourselves. We look at these people who obtain great wealth but appear shallow, stupid and ridiculous, and we secretly feel superior to them because we are supposedly not as materialistic and we are supposedly more cultured. We find comfort in knowing that even if we don’t have the same amount of money, at least we care about more important things and we have better morals. This mentality, however, may just be a hypocritical way to boost our own ego, since if we’re really better than them, why would we need justifications through trashy media? The blowup of this Rich Kids phenomenon is then not only an indication of growing materialism, but also a rise in hypocrisy in society’s standard ethical values.

Lately, my news feed has been overrun with sponsored advertisements promising to “BLOW YOUR MIND” — these posts usually discuss topics such as what a celebrity used to wear, or offer a compilation of cats in various poses. Regardless of the subject matter, I have yet to be anything more than mildly amused.
There is nothing inherently wrong with articles pandering to what readers want to see, because it is how these websites make money. But even when a media outlet reduces its content standards to focus on non-news, generally trivial subject matter, they still have a responsibility to provide the content in question in a way that doesn’t simply exploit the viewer. In addition, Facebook and other websites that spread news media content have a responsibility to balance more shallow content with real news, because the saturation of clickbait media is forcing more and more news outlets to change their business models.
Instead, these “clickbait” websites are changing the very structure of their content to maximize advertising revenue at the expense of the viewer. Showing one picture per page with a “click to navigate” button to see more content, they extend “10 facts about these sports legends that will change your life” into a ten-page article with barely ten sentences and ten pictures of actual content, often with advertisements thrown into the mix — and these are in addition to the banner advertisements that already accompany the side of the article. Often, there are so many advertisements that it is difficult to distinguish between them and the minimal content.
Unfortunately, these websites use this strategy because it works. Clickbaiting has become a science: luring viewers in with an ambiguous title promising great content, then forcing them to click through page after page to find it. This makes sense, as Facebook has an algorithm for providing content to viewers that can be easily exploited. But it is as much the viewers’ fault as it is that of the content creators that such poor content is thriving.
Users of these websites, then, need to become more aware of when they are being manipulated versus when they are being provided quality content. Content creators, obviously, provide content that they predict will be read — by refusing to click on manipulative content, viewers can change what outlets will produce. This is easier said than done, as the whole idea of clickbait is based around the idea that it is hard to resist. But by becoming more conscientious consumers of media, viewers can help decrease the saturation of manipulative content that has become so pervasive in social media.
Again, this isn’t to say that all content of this nature is bad. Sometimes you want to consume mindless or shallow content, and there is nothing wrong with that. There is a difference, however, between providing this content and using it to cash out on advertising revenue or number of page views. To improve the content that saturates our social media and the Internet, consumers must prove that they don’t want to be manipulated in this way.
Clickbait journalism and media doesn’t just exploit the viewer, either. As it becomes more and more mainstream, reputable news outlets are having to compete for page views by diminishing their content. Last week, for example, Time magazine published an article titled “This Photo of Kim Kardashian Shows Why Women Can’t Have It All,” criticizing Kardashian for “trying to be every type of woman at the same time” based on one paparazzi photo. Time, a generally professional news organization, should not be posting this kind of content in the first place. What makes it worse, however, is that it seems to have been designed specifically to garner page views, with a buzzword celebrity and a title that hints at interesting content. It’s unfortunate that even a publication like Time has to resort to these techniques to stay relevant.
There are plenty of reasons for this rise in clickbait journalism, with the blame falling on both publishers and readers alike — according to Tony Hailie, CEO of website traffic-monitoring company Chartbeat, there is no correlation between media consumers reading and sharing articles. When people generally just skim articles, it makes sense that the most easily skimmable and most shocking-at-a-glance articles will thrive. But to keep content publishers’ standards high — and to prevent readers from being manipulated by these publishers — it is important to recognize these trends in content, and respond appropriately. Both readers and the social media websites that act as the vehicle for sharing content should pressure these producers to provide the content they advertise, not content for advertising and page views.
