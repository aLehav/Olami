Voter turnout was down in this year’s Undergraduate Student Government election by 39 percent, according to Associate Director of Election and Recruitment Logan Dallas. Dallas announced during the election results on Tuesday that 3,700 votes were cast in this election, compared to last year’s election, where 6,027 votes were cast.
Dallas mentioned the shortened campaign. The 2015 race lasted three weeks, instead of the two weeks we saw this year. Dallas said it was a reaction to the oversaturation experienced by students in 2015.
“Firstly, we had a shorter campaign as reaction to last year’s Rini vs. Providence Campaign,” Dallas said. “We got a lot of feedback from organizers and people running campaigns that the elections needed restructuring. Students were being bombarded.”
Dallas also mentioned the reduced competition this election year, leading to a lack of motivation for voters.
“This year, people weren’t as fired up.” Dallas said. “Maybe because the candidate tickets are quite similar.”
Student sentiment echoes Dallas’ theories. Carlotta Gartner, a junior majoring in business administration, did not vote in the election. She said the USG election was not a priority to her or her peers.
“I saw it outside, but honestly, I’m not really interested.” Gartner said. “I never really discuss it with other students; it didn’t seem like a big discussion in class or with my friends.”
Matteo Tanaka, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science, did vote in the election. Yet his interest was fleeting. Tanaka picked the ticket he was exposed to most.
“I chose them because I saw their posters the most,” Tanaka said. “I was aware that [the elections] were coming, but I didn’t know when. I just happened upon them on the way home.”
Tanaka commented on the importance of the election to the average student and the lack of effect it has on the student body.
“No one’s really interested; no one really sees the value,” Tanaka said. “The student body president isn’t an immediate concern. It doesn’t seem to have a direct effect on you personally.”
Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article contained a misspelling. It is “student body president” not “study body president.” The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Students, faculty and staff at the School of Cinematic Arts came together in a town hall style forum hosted by the SCA Council of Diversity to have an open discussion about inclusion in the school and the entertainment industry at large on Thursday. The agenda for the night included an open mic where students could share personal anecdotes and voice opinions relating to the state of diversity at SCA.
These conversations are part of an ongoing effort to address campus climate. Last fall, USC’s Provost Office issued a campus-wide memorandum on “access and opportunity, diversity and inclusion” on behalf of President Nikias and the entire USC student body.
Students at the town hall, which took place in the SCA Gallery, talked about how some stories never even have the opportunity to be told, specifically those authored by or for communities underrepresented in race, gender, sexual orientation or class.
Christopher Ortega, a black sophomore majoring in film and television production, said he felt that his stories were misunderstood by faculty members in a way that inhibited his artistic freedom. He explained how students of diverse backgrounds feel pressured to align their work with culturally dominant narratives featuring white, male, heterosexual characters and how a more diverse SCA faculty would improve that.
“More diversity at the faculty level would at least give a new perspective on how stories are told,” Ortega said.
In addition to a more diverse faculty, other students called for a reform of the films that are shown and discussed in SCA classes.
“We really need to make sure that we’re investing some time, energy and effort into seeing work from directors of color and marginalized voices that have been doing this work for a long time,” said Rachel Summers, a MFA production student.
The panel leaders ended the night with a summary of proposed initiatives to enhance diversity and inclusion at SCA. These included a push for a more diverse faculty and student body, diversity training for faculty and staff, reform of the major’s foundation course, Introduction to Cinema 190 and serious discussion about content in all classes.
Panel leader Funkster Scerbak, a sophomore majoring in interactive media and games, seemed optimistic about the changes that could be implemented at SCA to improve issues of diversity in the industry.
“We need to talk about accessibility that people have to cinema in the first place, and I think that SCA is a great place to start with that,” Scerbak said. “We need to bring in a lot of different people, and that’s where the argument of merit versus race is kind of bogus, because context is invariably more important than merit or race.”

USC students will soon have a chance to compete in College Star, a collegiate singing competition modeled after American Idol. While the show was initially available to UC Berkeley students exclusively, Brent Freed, a junior at UC Berkeley and the producer of College Star, is bringing the show to the USC campus this March.
“The model works so well in Berkeley — we have hundreds of people that would audition,” Freed said. “After a couple years, I realized — this could work at so many other schools. Having had a lot of family members who went to USC, and as a big fan of USC myself, I said to myself, ‘Why don’t I give it a shot at USC?’”
The competition begins with an online audition, which is currently open, and will close on Feb. 21. Students who wish to compete in the future rounds of the show should upload online audition videos through the College Star Channel of Indi.com, an online platform promoting music. Original compositions, covers, and any genre — rap, country or pop — is welcome.
The show has also partnered with 1500 or Nothin’, a musical ensemble composed of producers and songwriters, some of whom have been nominated for Grammy Awards, which will evaluate all the contestants throughout the show. The company has previously produced for Bruno Mars, Snoop Dogg, Adele and Beyoncé, as well as Kendrick Lamar’s Grammy-winning album, To Pimp a Butterfly.
The top 24 contestants from the online audition will be invited to the Boot Camp weekend, held at USC on March 5-6, where they will be offered training sessions with record producers. The 12 best contestants will be given a chance to perform at the live show at the Belasco Theater on March 24.
“At the live show, the audience gets to vote through a texting service,” Freed said. “The judges will also vote. The two votes will be calculated, and the winner will be immediately determined at the live show.”
The winner of the show will get a chance to produce a single with the producers. Grant Genske, a previous winner of the show and a graduate of UC Berkeley, released an EP three months ago.
“The producers are only providing the platform to meet with songwriters, producers, managers and help people get opportunities to work with people who have a lot of experience with the music industry,” Freed said. “The winner of the show becomes a campus icon. Grant lives in San Francisco, but he has been offered opportunities in Los Angeles, and will be move to L.A. soon to pursue his music career.”
Any USC student is eligible. According to Freed, winners of the show have included everyone from engineers to political science majors.
“What we are creating is an opportunity for students to showcase their talent,” Freed said. “We do not feel like every single student that goes to college is a musician or majoring in pop music. Whether you are an a capella singer or pop music singer, an engineer or a math major, this competition is very diverse. It is open to anybody who sings.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the winners of the competition will have the opportunity to produce an album. It is a single. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The excitement in Andrew Kozlovski’s voice is clear as he reels off the ingredients in the chemical cocktail he’s brewed; Brainz Power is a mixture of dietary supplements and research chemicals that gives students an additional edge in their learning abilities.
The cognitive enhancement tonic Kozlovski, a sophomore studying business, designed is a nootropic, which comes from the Greek “noos” for “mind.” It is intended to safely enhance cognitive functioning by promoting better memory, clarity, focus and enhanced problem-solving abilities and has resulted in a successful entrepreneurial venture for Kozlovski.
According to Kozlovski, the idea for the nootropic came after he realized that many of his fellow students were taking prescription pills in order to concentrate more effectively.
“It’s the demand from the student community which made me start researching,” Kozlovski said. “Once I saw that there are alternatives to prescribed medication, I started to think that I had a pretty good idea.”
Kozlovski went about looking for a natural solution and started collecting ingredients for his formula, which would later become Brainz Power. Once the manufacturers for the drug were found, he came up with a sustainable marketing plan and has gone about executing it for the past eight months. The venture boasts a highly popular Instagram account, which Kozlovski notes as the most effective channel among all of social media with a following of more than 100,000.
According to Kozlovski, Brainz Power works because similar products like Adderall are inaccessible to the general population and are not healthy. Kozlovski noted that all the ingredients of his product are natural and, therefore, completely safe for consumption. Legally, the product has passed all verifications, as the manufacturing unit and the process under which the formula is made have been approved by the FDA.
Kozlovski believes that this is the first time that a nootropic has been marketed to such an extent, reaching out to more people as a primary option instead of an alternative. The tonic bottles are priced at $3 each, a price that Kozlovski said he is able to maintain because he uses free online promotions instead of costly newspaper advertisements. This business scheme has helped the venture reach out to several hundred thousand customers.
For Kozlovski, the motivation behind starting this venture was more than just executing a business plan successfully.
“I was always looking for a great business idea that I could work on,” Kozlovski said. “But I was also looking for a way in which I could invent something that could make a difference in people’s lives.”
Kozlovski has had an abundance of support from his friends and professors, who have encouraged him throughout the process.
“It was great to hear someone so young create a solution to stop college kids to stop abusing harmful medications,” said Michael Wang, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience. “He told me about how the science works behind all of the ingredients, and I looked them up. There are universities that have tested these ingredients, concluding and confirming that there are positive results.”

No. 12 USC baseball opens its season against North Dakota at Dedeaux Field on Friday where the Trojans look to forget their disappointing loss in extra-innings to Virginia in last year’s NCAA Regional Final. Although the team’s trip to Lake Elsinore in 2015 didn’t end the way head coach Dan Hubbs had planned, he hoped his players would take confidence from their postseason experience and bring it into the new year.
“Virginia were the eventual national champions,” Hubbs said. “And the team that they beat [in the College World Series Finals], Vanderbilt, we beat earlier in the year. Another team, TCU, went [to the World Series], and we beat them, too.”
Hubbs also said the key to having a good season, starting this weekend against the Fighting Hawks, was to “maintain that edge” that the squad’s returning members earned through their experience last season.
“The makeup on the team is strong. I think the makeup of the team is great,” Hubbs said. “We have a ton of guys back from last year’s team who know what it takes, and the leadership is strong.”
Senior pitcher Kyle Davis is one of 20 returners to the Trojan roster this year, and he is scheduled to toe the rubber as the starter for Friday’s opener. The veteran hurler, who was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 29th round of last summer’s MLB draft, was itching to get back on the mound in a non-intrasquad game.
“It’ll be nice to finally face another team other than ourselves,” Davis said. “Getting out there again and pitching on opening day will be cool for me.”
Junior Jeremy Martinez, who will be called on to fill the backstop void left by graduated Johnny Bench Award winner Garrett Stubbs this year, agreed.
“It’s going to be nice to put on a uniform again, to see fans in the stadium and all that good stuff we like playing baseball for,” Martinez said. “If we play our type of baseball, we’re going to come out on top with a three-game sweep.”
After spending most of 2015 at first base, Martinez will catch and call the games for Davis and the rest of the pitching staff against an unfamiliar foe in North Dakota. The Fighting Hawks compete in the Western Athletic Conference against the likes of Cal State Bakersfield and Seattle University.
The last time the Trojans played anyone from the conference was in 2014, when they beat Grand Canyon, 6-3, at home. North Dakota finished last season with a 24-27 overall record. The Fighting Hawks entered the WAC Tournament as the No. 3 seed and managed to beat Northern Colorado, but successive losses to Bakersfield and Sacramento State denied them a conference championship.
Regardless of opponent, Martinez said the team is looking forward to starting the season.
“[We want] to just go out there and have fun, not put too much pressure on ourselves and enjoy the moment,” Martinez said.
But when asked about their ambitions for the season as a whole, both Martinez and Davis have very clear goals in mind.
“It’s national championship or bust,” Martinez said.
Davis agreed with Martinez.
“Especially coming off of last year,” Davis said. “Being so experienced this year, it’ll be Omaha, the World Series.”
First pitch on opening day is scheduled for 6 p.m. on Friday at Dedeaux Field. Saturday’s game begins at 2 p.m., and the Trojans will wrap up their three-game set against North Dakota on Sunday at 1 p.m.

The Women of Troy hit the road this weekend to play Pac-12 leader Oregon State and Oregon. Both Oregon schools have winning records in conference, and USC will have their hands full this weekend.
“You could argue that these two are the hottest teams in the league right now,” associate head coach Beth Burns said.
USC (18-8, 6-8) will first head to Corvallis, Oregon, on Friday to play No. 7 Oregon State (22-3, 13-1).  Oregon State has been phenomenal all season, only losing once in conference play to UCLA Jan. 4. Since then, the Beavers have won 12 in a row, including a 67-44 blowout of fellow Pac-12 competitor No. 9 ASU.
Oregon State has stifled opponents with their defense all year, limiting opponents to 50.1 points per game, which makes them fifth best in the nation. The Beavers have been exceptional at protecting the paint this season and the Women of Troy will need to be able to make the most of their opportunities if they hope to defeat the red-hot Beavers.
“We really worked hard this week on making shots,” Burns said. “It’s really hard getting paint points against Oregon State since they’re so long and so big.”
Senior guard Jamie Weisner is Oregon State’s best player.  Weisner has been stellar for the Beavers all season — averaging 17.4 points per game — and is coming off a career-high 27-point performance against Utah.  She has been the leader of the Beavers’ offense all season long and the team will need to try and limit her production if they hope to leave Corvallis with a win. Weisner had 14 points against the Women of Troy in the Beaver’s matchup against USC.
USC then heads to Eugene, Oregon to play a Ducks team that has been playing well as of late.  The Ducks (19-6, 8-6) started out the season undefeated before struggling in conference play, including a loss at USC on Jan. 4. However, the Ducks have won five straight and are 8-1 in their last nine games with the lone loss coming to No. 9 ASU.  The Ducks are also one of the highest scoring teams in the nation — averaging 75 points per game — and USC will have their hands full when they visit Eugene.
The player to watch from Oregon is senior forward Jillian Alleyne — who is currently averaging 18.6 points per game.  Alleyne is from nearby Fontana and is one of the best players in the NCAA.  She was rated No. 16 in ESPNW’s preseason list of the top 25 players in the nation and has not disappointed with her performance this season.  She is a key cog in the Duck’s high-powered offense and USC has to make it a focal point to try and limit Alleyne.  Alleyne had a dominating 23 points and 17 rebounds in her previous matchup against USC.
“[Alleyne] is a double-double machine but we have our own double-double machine in Temi Fagbenle,” Burns said.
Coming off a disappointing loss to Washington, USC salvaged the weekend with a win against Washington State on Sunday. USC continues to miss starters Brianna Barrett and Jordan Adams and in order for the Women of Troy to leave the state of Oregon with a pair of victories this weekend, Temi Fagbenle must continue her stellar play.
After struggling with foul trouble versus Washington, Fagbenle bounced back with a phenomenal 26-point 13-rebound performance against Washington State. Fagbenle has been a crucial part of USC’s success this season, and this weekend will be no different.

Last weekend, I was taking a Lyft back to campus when small talk with my driver led to reactions to the Super Bowl.
I told him I was disappointed that the Carolina Panthers lost because I like Cam Newton. My driver, a middle-aged white man, was incredulous.
“Why?” he asked. “I’ve never seen a more arrogant, whiny player in my life. The way he goofs around on the field shows he’s only in it for himself. And how he acted at the press conference? What a sore loser.”
To which I responded by saying Newton was simply having fun with football, smiling and dabbing — his signature celebratory move — and letting his personality show. The driver conceded the point, but was still emphatic that he didn’t like Newton and was glad the Panthers lost to the Denver Broncos.
I couldn’t help but chuckle to myself and think that this man epitomized exactly what detractors have been whining about ever since Newton burst onto the scene: How dare this quarterback be black, talented and brash enough to do things his way? How dare he show his true emotions after losing the biggest game of his life?
To be fair, Newton is the kind of player you would hate to have on the opposing team. Skill-wise, he’s extremely talented as a dual-threat quarterback, and at 26 years of age, is just reaching his prime. But on top of that, he rubs it in. He smiles like he doesn’t have a care in the world. When he scores a touchdown, he dances, dabs and dances some more.
People have a problem with that. They see a black athlete not just succeeding but actually imposing his will on the game while playing a position historically dominated by white men, and they have no idea how to react. For instance, a mother who attended a Panthers game with her daughter wrote a letter to the Charlotte Observer chiding Newton for his arrogance and not being a proper role model.
“I’m an African-American quarterback that may scare a lot of people because they haven’t seen nothing they can compare me to,” Newton said in January.
How’s this for comparison: Aaron Rodgers’ “Discount Double Check” celebration has earned him millions in endorsements from State Farm. Tom Brady’s constant cursing on the sidelines has led to actual FCC complaints. Carson Palmer was fined by the league after he taunted Seahawks’ fans with a pelvic thrust during a game last November.
I don’t see how Newton’s “dab” is any different from Rodgers’ championship-belt maneuver, yet Rodgers is glorified while Newton is criticized. Despite Deflategate and being generally disliked by anyone outside New England, Tom Brady’s reputation is still higher than that of Newton’s. And why weren’t there any “letters to the editor” after Palmer’s inappropriate maneuver?
This is the double standard that exists between famous black and white sports figures, a juxtaposition that has become even clearer with the recent allegations against Peyton Manning that range from having human growth hormone distributed to his wife in 2011 to the resurfacing of a 1996 incident in which Manning was accused of sexually harassing a trainer when he was at Tennessee.
While the facts in both allegations remain blurry, illegal doping and sexual harassment are real-world incidents that merit greater discussion and criticism than some dance a black quarterback does after scoring a touchdown.
Yet, in the days following the Super Bowl, all the criticism was directed at Newton for his supposed “poor conduct” in his postgame press conference, where he barely answered questions before saying, “I’m done, man,” and walking out.
For this, Newton got pummeled. He was portrayed as a sore loser, chastised for gloating during victory but acting like a child after defeat. People wanted him to show some humility and own up to his pompous actions on the field. Instead, he spit on them, but unlike Brady or Bill Belichick – who often do the same thing to the media – it only added on to the notion that Newton was a stuck-up, self-centered jerk.
Meanwhile, on the field after the Super Bowl, Manning went rogue with his sponsorship plugs, kissing Papa John and mentioning several times in interviews that he would celebrate by drinking a Budweiser. Active players are not allowed to sponsor alcohol brands, but hey, nothing to look at here. Manning is a squeaky-clean, picture-perfect white quarterback with a golden boy image, and thus deserves a free pass.
I don’t know why race in sports is still an issue in this day and age, but clearly, the backlash to Newton’s rise shows the problem has not been solved. Newton is not a sore loser; he is a football star who has fun with the game and is not afraid to display his emotions but just happens to be black. Let’s set aside these ridiculous stereotypes and appreciate talented athletes – white or black, dab or no dab – for who they are.

Great article.  So far the comments only serve to reinforce the author’s point.
I like Cam Newton. But I don’t see how the race card comes into this.
It is not the color of his skin but the content of his character that rubs folks the wrong way.  The writer is too young to understand that Cam Newton was a cheater and a theif. He left UF for a junior college in Texas because the campus police dept was going to arrest him for stealing another student’s laptop. Then prior to attending Auburn, his father shopped him to the SEC schools and he attended school of the highest bidder. Known fact.
No doubt the man is talented, but a role model for young kids, he is not.
The cabbie made no racial slurs. Most likely, he was merely disgruntled about the lavish attention paid to a quarterback young, brash and highly successful. Why inject race and accusations of racism? The accusation of unfairness and racism point at the writer, not at the grumpy cabbie.

The women’s lacrosse team will face Duke in Costa Mesa at 7 p.m. Saturday. The Women of Troy are off to a flying start after dismantling Stetson 21-2 at McAlister Field in the season opener.
Junior attacker Michaela Michael bagged six goals in the game, consistently breezing by Hatters defenders en route to the net. Meanwhile, junior Drew Jackson attacked Stetson in the midfield all afternoon. Jackson scored a hat trick and also did her bits defensively, forcing a handful of turnovers.
Jackson and Michael looked unstoppable, as did senior midfielder Amanda Johansen. During the program’s inaugural season in 2013, Johansen was named Rookie of the Year in MPSF. Three years on, Johansen has emerged as a veteran leader and an anchor in the middle for the Women of Troy.
Johansen and Jackson powered the midfield in the blowout win over Stetson, but the defense played lights out.
Senior Courtney Tarleton and junior Nina Kelty held down the fort and ensured that goalie sophomore Gussie Johns had a relaxing afternoon between the pipes. The defensive reinforcements, including senior Carley Horan, also stepped up and never lost concentration even once the team had built an unassailable lead.
While Michael’s offensive dominance will be key in the upcoming fixture against Duke, the outcome of this game could very well come down to USC’s defensive performance. Duke is the No. 5 team in the land and is averaging more than 15.3 goals per game this season. The Blue Devils have played three games thus far, one of which was a home defeat to perennial powerhouse Northwestern.
The Women of Troy fell just short in last season’s opener to Northwestern — a 12-11 overtime loss at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. In fact, this year’s opener, despite the lopsided score line, was a milestone for the program. USC women’s lacrosse was 0-3 in season openers, a statistic head coach Lindsey Munday certainly did not forget after the victory.
Munday lauded her team’s positive spirit after the win and expressed her pride for a talented senior class that has built the program from scratch.
“These girls bought into something that didn’t exist,” Munday said of the seniors. “They bought into sort of a vision, and so that’s really all you can ask for as a coach.”
Nearly half the roster is composed of seniors. But it is Michael who will look to break her point total of 76 a season ago. Duke will undoubtedly need to craft an excellent game plan in order to slow — let alone stop — the dynamic attacker.
Michael attributes her success to those around her.
“I think it’s really all about my teammates,” Michael said. “They know what I’m good at, and they know what situations I want to get the ball in.”
Before the Duke game, Munday will likely be doing shooting drills with the team.
“I think offensively you can always work on your shooting,” Munday said.
USC’s shooting against Stetson looked great, but an elite Blue Devils defense will really put the Women of Troy’s shooting accuracy to the test.
Saturday’s game is part of the 2016 Orange County Winter Invitational.

Los Angeles’ Thai Town is home to hundreds of local establishments serving tom yums and pad thais. However, one of the most authentic Thai meals you can get is not located in Thai Town. Located within the quiet end of LA’s Chinatown, Pok Pok LA is a gem for those seeking to experience vibrancy and the spice of Southeast Asian culture.
Pok Pok LA traces its roots to the original Portland establishment founded by chef Andy Ricker. After expanding from Portland to New York, Pok Pok earned a Michelin star and received widespread acclaim for its gourmet Thai dishes. Despite the fact that Ricker is not of Thai descent, the culinary veteran has traveled to Southeast Asia extensively over the years, learning new recipes and techniques from natives.
Located in the Mandarin Plaza on N. Broadway, Pok Pok LA strives to create a relaxing environment where people can experience authentic cuisine. With year-round Christmas lights, vintage Thai banners and kitschy floral-patterned tablecloths, the restaurant successfully imitates what an actual restaurant would look like in Thailand. The servers offer their recommendations to patrons while explaining every possible aspect of the dish. From the origins of the fish sauce to the technique in which pandan leaves are marinated in the water served, the servers are especially knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu and provide amazing service for restaurant-goers.
The menu itself is unique because each dish is accompanied by a statement of where its origins are derived. By doing so, Pok Pok LA hopes to emphasize its authenticity to restaurant patrons who may question the validity and style of the dishes. It is guaranteed that Pok Pok LA is one of the best locations for not only tasty, but also gourmet specialities from Northern and Northeastern Thailand. The items on the menu are divided into shareable appetizers, single entrées and shared entrées with sides. On the back are a variety of drink options, ranging from beers to Thai-style limeade.
The signature item on the menu happens to not be Thai: Ike’s Vietnamese fish sauce wings are arguably some of the best wings in Los Angeles. With wings from establishments like KyoChon pailing in comparison, the fish sauce wings are unlike any other chicken wings. Ike’s wings are marinated and tossed in caramelized fish sauce from Vietnam’s Phu Quoc Islands, renowned for its expertise in fish sauce production. There was an excellent balance between the sweet and savory, and the dish paired especially well with a cold Tsingtao beer. Ike’s fish sauce wings are, as many people say, “finger-lickin’ good.”
The next dish was khao soi, a mild curry noodle soup made with house-pressed coconut milk. Served with either chicken or vegetables, the dish contains egg and crispy fried noodles along with shallots, picked mustard greens and special roasted chili paste. The khao soi was a perfectly executed dish; the mildness of the spice complemented the creaminess and consistency of the broth. The coconut milk did not overwhelm the flavor of the broth, and the crispy noodles added a unique texture to the noodle dish.
The final dish was a shareable entrée called kaeng hang leh. Served in a clay pot, the braised pork belly and shoulder were marinated in a special Chiang Mai specialty curry with ginger, palm sugar, turmeric, tamarind, Burmese curry powder (phong masala) and pickled garlic. The server noted that the phong masala was imported from a special vendor in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The braised pork belly went well with a portion of sticky rice. The sauce was sweet but also had a distinctive savory taste that was reminiscent of other Asian minced-pork dishes. The kaeng hang leh, however, was the weakest item that was ordered in terms of flavor complexity and technique.
For dessert, the Pok Pok Affogato is a customer favorite. The house-made condensed milk ice cream was drenched in a shot of Vietnamese black coffee and paired with crispy Thai crullers. The consistency of the ice cream was particularly rich and creamy, while the Thai crullers went surprisingly well with the melted ice cream and coffee shot.
Pok Pok LA has earned its reputation as one of the most authentic restaurants serving Thai cuisine. Despite being on the more expensive side, the restaurant has continuously brought in waves of new customers and five-star reviews. Pok Pok LA is undeniably a restaurant to try in Los Angeles in the near future.

It’s just another Pleasant Valley Sunday. You’re listening to some oldies while taking the Last Train to Clarksville. You’re staring out the window like the Daydream Believer that you are. Gotten the hint yet? Yeah, that’s right. Hey, hey, it’s the Monkees!
This month, the beloved ’60s group announced they were releasing a brand new album later this year to celebrate their 50th anniversary. Let’s get one thing straight: no, I am not just messing up the name of Alex Turner’s backing band. For those who don’t get the name recognition, The Monkees were a rock/pop group from the late 1960s chosen for the purpose of a television show.
The band, composed of Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork, Michael Nesmith and Davy Jones, receive a lot of flak for their origins. They didn’t write most of their own music, weren’t originally experienced or accomplished musicians and their songs didn’t have the same substance as their quartet counterparts The Beatles, but that doesn’t mean they didn’t make waves. Tork is credited as financially assiting Jimi Hendrix’s career, and Hendrix even later opened for them. David Bowie was born David Jones but changed his stage name so as not to get confused with the then-popular Davy Jones. The Sex Pistols covered them, Kurt Cobain adorned his guitar with them, Brian Wilson was inspired by them and Breaking Bad showed meth being cooked soundtracked by them.
So why do I feel required to preface my discussion of The Monkees with a paragraph of credibility? Why is it that some bands have to fight for legitimacy in this industry? Music is filled with this idea of “bands we love to hate.” Certain genres and lots of artists are constantly preceded as a “guilty pleasure,” as if the mere enjoyment of a musician isn’t enough to validate it. Is it because the Monkees didn’t always write their own music or because their marketing schemes were so direct? Or maybe even because Davy Jones was a pretty boy or because they were backed by a laugh-tracked sitcom?
Regardless, why is it that music is broken down to its components when it’s so much more than the sum of its parts? At the end of the day, through the entire process, a song is created. When you fall in love with a person, when that person challenges you, excites you and inspires you, do you care that the person was raised in one neighborhood or another? That it was their teacher or their parent who influenced them? Or do you just enjoy the person lying next to you. So why should what goes into a song make it any less real?
“Daydream Believer” was written by John Stewart and produced by Chip Stewart. Record execs, producers and writers saw through the song before it reached Jones’ hands, but I still cry whenever I hear it. Whatever songs the boys didn’t have a large hand in creating were recreated in the recording studio by their own experiences and emotions. Dolenz once said, at the end of a Monkees episode, that he wanted to be an architect so he could build something that would last forever. I’m just a human and one day I’ll die (probably from tripping; I’m incredibly clumsy), but those four boys taught me the importance of looking beyond the surface, loving without elitism, laughing without judgment and goofing off because it’s f-cking fun. They helped me become the fun loving person I am, who doesn’t limit her adorations because of a superiority complex. Every time I’ve introduced a friend to a new band. Every time I’ve embarrassed myself to cheer up my friends. Every time I’ve remembered that severity doesn’t make a person important, sincerity does. All these times and more, created a ripple effect that will live on in some manner or another and that is an architectural structure that Dolenz created. And that is not invalidated or discredited by who wrote what songs or scripts.

Ding-dong, kids. After 29 years on the Supreme Court, our favorite Associate Racist — er, I mean Justice — Antonin Scalia, has sadly died. A precious vacancy and a wall of conservative partisan screaming has been left in his wake.
In the measly five days following Scalia’s passing, the Republican party has come forward at full force to demand that President Barack Obama not invoke his presidential right to appoint the justice’s successor. In a stroke of politically motivated hypocrisy and partisan enmity, the Republican Party has once again showcased their unwillingness to hold any values sacred, play by any rules or hold their tongues on any matter if doing so impedes establishment goals.
But actions like these have profound consequences. For one, they continue to alienate millennial voters and potential party members. In the coming election and moving forward into the 2018 midterms, young Republicans need to urge their party to abandon their partisan crusade, reel in their radical sects and come back to the table like the educated adults they claim to be. Otherwise, in 20 years, they may not have a party at all — or at least not one they’d want to be a part of.
Scalia wasn’t popular, that’s to be sure. It’s not hard to see why — any man who’s willing to publicly say that he recommends easier universities for black students isn’t going to win over many supporters.
It also didn’t help that Scalia was a strong proponent of constitutional originalism — a philosophy that holds that judicial review should be practiced according to the exact wording and original meaning of the Constitution. But the Constitution wasn’t built to be rigid; it was written with purposeful elasticity to avoid becoming an obsolete artifact rather than a lasting backbone of national purpose. The Founding Fathers couldn’t ever have imagined the social and economic questions we face today — affirmative action, social security, LGBT rights, the Equal Rights Amendment or abortion. They did their best with what Western culture had historically experienced, allowing fluidity for the Constitution to operate in situations they couldn’t expect.  Scalia’s use of word-by-word interpretation primarily served to delay and impede the achievement of civil rights for women, gay people and people of color. It’s not hard to see why the Republican Party loved him so much.
But it says very clearly in Scalia’s beloved Constitution that the sitting president nominates Supreme Court justices when vacancies emerge. There’s no clause adding, “unless it’s a black Democrat you don’t like.” And last time I checked, the President’s term was for four years — not three and a half or until you hammer your Ted Cruz for President picket into your front lawn.
In keeping with that same originalism Republicans loved, Scalia would probably be the first person to say that Obama should appoint his successor. Unsurprisingly, the Republican Party is supporting whatever is to its own benefit, regardless of hypocrisy. Let’s be candid: the Republican Party isn’t resisting Obama’s appointment privilege because they think it’s really the “right” of the next president. They’re resisting because they recognize that the next justice will in all likelihood be liberal.
A reminder to the Republican Party: You lost the 2012 election. You had your chance. You lost. The citizens of the United States, the country you claim to love so much, chose a Democratic president — twice — and he’s going to have the privileges that come with his office. Maybe Republicans who can’t accept it should go back to kindergarten, a setting better suited for their selfish whining.
The few young voters who still support the Republican Party establishment need to act and express to their party that they don’t condone hypocrisy for the sake of partisan interests. If they detest Hillary Clinton for her embroilment in establishment, corporate politics, they should equally despise the selfish and deplorable actions of their own establishment, corporate party. If they really believe in the values they say they do — patriotism, strict morality, hard work and playing by the rules — they might want to communicate to their party, in the coming election as well as the following midterms, that they want to see those values reflected in the actions of Republican candidates and party leaders. If the next generation of Republicans doesn’t turn the party around and get control of its radical ends, the 21st century evolution of the Republican establishment might not be one they like all that much. Republicans, you’ve got issues to fix.
So get it together.
Lily Vaughan is a freshman majoring in history and political science. Her column, “Playing Politics,” runs  Fridays.
Ms. Vaughn: Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I respond with respect (and a little sarcasm, if you’ll excuse me) . There is so much wrong in what you say, its hard to know where to begin. First, on the appointment clause of the Constitution, a clause I’m not sure if you read carefully; there are two parts to it. The clause says there is equal power in the president and the Senate in appointing a new Justice.The President is welcome to fulfill his part anytime. The Senate is under no obligation whether controlled by Democrats, Republicans or Wickens to do its part under any time constraint. The Senate may respond in 15 minutes to the next regressive, radical leftist judge Mr. Obama nominates or it may never respond. That’s the rules we live by. And in section 5 of the Constitution it allows you to lobby your Congressmen or State representatives to amend the Constitution in any way you see fit. That is called the rule of law in our civilized society. ( I presume between leftist indoctrination sessions at USC you have learned the Constitution may be amended in two ways under section 5.)  And secondly, I find it very problematic that you seem to think you speak for all millennials. Many people your age have been raised by people like me who deeply love America and our Constitution. We  and millions of our children reject the leftist values you seem to embrace. This is a beautiful country. constitutional republicans now embrace the traditional great liberal values of our American founding. The left on our campuses, in our MSM, and Democratic party embrace the throw back, regressive, degrading tired and worn Marxism and socialism of the 19th Century. Thank God millions of our young people understand American values and will reject the meanness and destructiveness of the Democratic leftist party. I understand you disagree. Neither of us needs to run to safe rooms . Its the beauty of America we still have freedom of speech. I presume you and your leftist colleagues are woking hard to overthrow that liberty as well. Take care: respect you as a person but obviously deeply disagree with some of your current ideas. People do change though. I was a Democrat once. I grew up and left the child like world of leftism .
The old Republican big tent has become a freak show—a real CRASS menagerie of True Christian (TC) pro-lifers with no concern for the life of a mommy, other TC that find no room in the inn for God’s Children from south of the border, and another assortment of TC that are True Conservatives more than anything else and are willing to stuff a camel haired fat cat name Trump through the eye of a needle right into the Oval Office. And they also got a TC standing for Ted Cruz that is going around lying like hell.  Meanwhile the pope of another TC (The Catholics) is not sure that needle-stuffed Trump sound much like a TC if he wants to build a wall to keep God’s’ children out of the inn.  
All of this kind of stuff is enough to short circuit Robo Boy Rubio into going around stuck saying the same thing . . .same thing . . . same thing,  No wonder Boy Jeb has his mommy and daddy and big brother out on the trail babysitting him with surely his old nanny  soon be showing up to change his diaper—what a mess!
Obstructionism is what Republicans are about these days.
It is 80 years since there was an election year appointment and never one that would so blatantly change the balance of the SCOTUS.  
The people have most recently spoken by firing Pelosi, Reid and taking the keys and the drivers wheel to the Senate and House away from the Democrats. The policies of Obama have weakened your party from the day of his inauguration.
The fact that Obama cannot even show his respect by attending his funeral of a faithful American is deplorable in many eyes but certainly not surprising after 7 years of service as POTUS.
You opine in this post with little facts.  
Iis disappointing to this fellow Trojan that such trite (unoriginal, overused thought) is given such prominent exposure. DT is a newspaper for USC Trojans and not a platform for espousing and advancing the liberal agenda. 
Scalia has already received far more respect than he ever deserved. He was an absolute obstructionist. 
You’re critically ignorant and delusional if you think otherwise. Seems it may be time for you to visit the fantasy land in the sky and leave reality to the actual adults.
Actually Obama was elected most recently by over 5 million vote margin with a specific consideration for who would fill court vacancies. The congressional shifts have most reflected Republican prowess at gerrymandering districts for the house, and commandeering small states for the senate. The Supreme Court is a collective concern and the collective desire of the electorate was for Obama to have this responsibility.

With almost two-thirds of the vote of the USC student body, Edwin Saucedo and Austin Dunn were voted into office Tuesday to be Undergraduate Student Government’s next president and vice president. But according to Associate Director of Elections and Recruitment Logan Dallas, only 3,700 students even voiced their opinion by voting — a nearly 40 percent decrease in voters compared to the USG presidential election last year.
Such a steep decrease in voter turnout to choose the leadership of student government seems unlikely following  the unprecedented rise in student activism that has graced our campus over the last year. Indeed, the involvement of students in campus politics has increased in the form of record-high attendance at Senate meetings and extremely competitive Senate elections.  But this momentum has just not manifested in voter turnout. And as USG moves into another year, it should critically analyze this change and put forth greater efforts toward increasing voter turnout in USG elections.
This semester, elections just didn’t get the same attention that it has in years past, and the problem stems from the modifications to the election system. According to Dallas, the duration that candidates were allowed to campaign decreased from three weeks to two weeks this election cycle. Such a truncation of campaign time may have contributed to a lack of awareness of USG elections on campus. This change to the overall process glazes over the issues the University needs to address.
Two weeks ago, the Daily Trojan Editorial Board outlined the issues the future USG president and vice president needed to address, including sexual assault prevention, increased sustainability measures and greater campus cohesion between various organizations. These matters have been spotlighted by students, who have rightfully criticized the current way things are conducted. However, without putting every effort to encourage students to vote, these concerns are not reflected in USG leadership in the next year.
The USG elections commission should strive to extend campaign time duration and greater advertise elections to guarantee that USC student government leadership is really representative of the will of the entire student body. This comes from increasing current voting incentives and encouraging students to make their voices heard at the ballot box. Moreover, the elections commission should put forth greater efforts in the form of advertising, using social media as well as through traditional methods like flyers in lecture halls. Student organizations and advocacy groups should also do their part to encourage their members to vote.
USC is not alone in suffering from low voter turnout. According to the Daily Bruin, just 29.6 percent of UCLA students elected their student government leadership last year. And according to NPR, in 2012, only 45 percent of millennials turned out to vote for the president of the United States. But this number is still more than twice the voter turnout of USG elections — which is less than 20 percent of the student body this year, considering that USG represents roughly 19,000 undergraduate students.
Trojans, we can do better. From every level — the personal to the organizational — USC students have created remarkable momentum in tackling what we need from the administration and one another. It’s time that USG capitalize on this unique moment in the University history and bring students to engage in the most basic form of participation in collegiate democracy — voting in elections.

Last year, I was driving up to USC with my dad and a car loaded full of my belongings. I was moving into my dorm in preparation to begin my life as a college student. To be frank, I was more scared than I was excited. I was afraid I wouldn’t get along with my suitemates and that I would have a difficult time adjusting to my new life. One of my biggest fears was the idea of eating alone at the dining hall. It sounds silly, but the thought of having no one to share a meal with seemed like the epitome of loneliness.
We live in a society where F.O.M.O, or Fear of Missing Out, is all too real. It’s imperative that we stay connected to our surroundings, because as soon as we fall out of the loop we are left in the dust. We’re glued to our phones. Eating alone is taboo. It’s come to the point where the idea of being alone has almost become reason to pity someone. “Alone” is something we want to avoid at all costs. 
It’s so easy to get caught up in the idea that we have to be constantly making social connections in order to be okay. Yes, it’s important to have friends and loved ones. We are meant to build relationships with people. But it’s just as important to be aware of who you are and what you need. Sometimes, it takes being alone to realize what those needs are. 
Ironically, being alone in the long term gave me more confidence. I learned a lot about myself that first year of college because not only was I away from home, but also I had to face the fact that there will be moments when I was going to be my own company. Being alone taught me that I, someone who struggled with the idea of self worth and value, didn’t need someone else to be complete. It taught me what I want and don’t want out of a relationship, whether it be with a friend or a lover. It allowed me the time to figure myself out. 
Being alone isn’t easy. It can be scary. But the next time you sit alone at dinner, don’t sweat it. These acts are a self investment that will be invaluable to your happiness and well being. 
You owe it to yourself.

With less than 90 days until graduation, there’s a certain pressure, partially self-imposed and partially peer-imposed, to capitalize on every opportunity during senior year. Everyone wants to make it the year of saying yes to every adventure, big or small. At the same time, however, I know I have a future to prepare for — that I need to make responsible decisions applying to jobs and saving money for post-grad. 
Trying to maximize all my opportunities to travel, to explore, to go to concerts, to take useful and exciting classes and more — basically to do everything — unfortunately, isn’t a sustainable lifestyle. I’m beginning to realize that both logistically and financially it’s kind of impossible to do it all. Sometimes there just isn’t enough time in the day.
So recently I’ve been asking myself where exactly to draw the line. Should there be an even balance between being responsible, and being restless? Or do I want to walk the line of how long I can put off writing that paper, how many new L.A. restaurants I can go to and how many trips I can afford while still landing a job and saving just enough in my bank account? 
For the past few months I’ve been looking into planning a post-grad trip to Iceland, and I’ve finally found a group of friends that’s ready to commit to booking plane tickets. However, with job applications with my name on them sitting on desks in cities across the United States, I’m unsure where to even book my flights from or where to return to. That’s logistical problem number one. 
Then, there’s the question of how long I can afford to be out of the country. Will I put my job prospects at risk if I would potentially need to delay when I could begin working? What about internships and fellowships I’ve already applied to that have strict June 1 start dates? I know this summer might be the last chance I get to travel for a while, and I want to make the most of it, but I also recognize that it’s not exactly responsible to jeopardize career opportunities in order to do so.
This internal struggle is part of the reason why many of my friends didn’t want to commit to a post-grad trip in the first place. It is a list of very valid concerns.
I know I’m extremely lucky to have all these opportunities in the realm of possibility while also graduating from a USC in the next few months. I also know that I’ll likely have to make certain choices. I can’t let the nagging question, “But when am I going to be able to do ______ or go to_______ after graduation ever again?” stress me out because, although it doesn’t seem like it now, a lot of these opportunities  may very well present themselves again in the future. (Even if it means waiting a few years for my vacation time to build up.) In the meantime though, I’ll just have to focus on being restless in the most responsible way possible.

Inevitably, the music we listen to now will be known as classics decades on. Nostalgia is what makes us humans, and music plays an important role whenever we feel like taking a walk down memory lane. As we grow older, music changes as we change. Though we can listen to what’s “in” right now while driving in L.A. traffic or at parties on the Row, there’s just something about old school tunes like “Yeah!” by Usher or Baby Bash’s “Suga Suga” that takes us back to a time of bliss. We often associate that love song with that high school crush, or can’t help dancing to tunes that just make us feel great. On the other hand, whenever the depressing song that we’ve overplayed comes on, we also feel pang of grief. The 2000s gave us millennials a time to feel alive and a way to get groovy with sentimental tunes. Here is a list of the top 20 songs from the year 2000 till 2010.
1. “Yeah!” by Usher feat. Lil Jon and Ludacris
2. “I Gotta Feeling” by The Black Eyed Peas
3. “Dead and Gone” by T.I. feat. Justin Timberlake
4. “We Belong Together” by Mariah Carey
5. “Gold Digger” by Kanye West feat. Jamie Foxx
6. “What Goes Around” by Justin Timberlake
7. “Lose Yourself” by Eminem
8. “Low” by Flo-Rida (Feat. T-pain)
9. “Feel Good Inc.” by Gorillaz
10. “Poker Face” by Lady Gaga
11. “You’re Beautiful” by James Blunt
12. “Umbrella” by Rihanna feat. Jay-Z
13. “Kids” by MGMT
14. “I’m Yours” by Jason Mraz
15. “Suga Suga” by Baby Bash feat. Frankie J
16. “Ridin” by Chamillionaire feat. Krayzie Bone

Last Saturday was a really big day for me, because in my quest to try all of the donut places in Los Angeles, I found my favorite one. This is a big deal, I swear. On the well-known street of Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice sits a small shop called Blue Star Donuts that, despite its own trendiness, gets intermixed with the rest of the hipster-vegan stores. I know the semester is not over and I still have several more donut shops to explore, but when you find a gem like this one in a sea of donut shops, one bite is enough to convince you that this place is a winner.
When I walked into the store, I peered over the shoulders of the customers waiting in line in front of me, and I noticed that there weren’t that many donuts to choose from. Regardless, I still had a difficult time deciding which ones to order because they all looked so appetizing. I finally settled on a Blueberry Bourbon & Basil (the shop’s most popular flavor) and a Mimosa Donut.
If I had to choose, I would say the Blueberry Bourbon & Basil was my favorite because the texture of the dough was so perfectly fluffy.This is a consistency that I have only found at gourmet donut places, which in itself makes paying the extra dollar or two worth it. On top of that, the blueberry-flavored frosting gave it a special touch to satisfy my sweet tooth without going overboard on the sugar.

The next donut I tried was the Mimosa Donut. I had never seen this flavor attempted anywhere else, so I just knew I had to try it. Just like the Blueberry Bourbon & Basil, this donut had the perfect dough consistency that reminded me of angel food cake in a way. This one, however, had a more tangy taste, which is perfect if that’s what you’re in the mood for that day!
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
Just like the rest of the shops on Abbot Kinney Boulevard, Blue Star Donuts is remarkably trendy with a minimalist style. I found it very fitting that they had a sign that said “Quality over Quantity,” because if there’s anything I dislike about Blue Star Donuts, it’s that it is a bit pricey.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
That said, however, there are many things I am willing to sacrifice for the luxury of treating myself to more of these five-star donuts. I also really appreciated the simple display of each donut flavor offered that day, but the shop was too small and could only fit the people who were in line so I ended up having to eat my donuts outside. Despite this minor inconvenience, I can hardly make myself complain about having to eat outside because Abbot Kinney Boulevard is the perfect place to eat while taking a stroll — especially on a sunny California day!
Blue Star Donuts is open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week at 1142 Abbot Kinney Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA, 90291.

Kendrick Lamar didn’t just walk away with five Grammys after the 58th Grammy Awards show. This past Monday, Kendrick put on an awe-inspiring performance that LL Cool J deemed “controversial” prior to his showcase. He narrated an empowering story that speaks to the underlying social issues regarding racism within our generation.
The chains and cell bars that were introduced at the beginning of Lamar’s performance immediately stunned the audience. His sophisticated dance techniques, along with his stage presence, validate his passion for conveying his message through his music and dancing, as demonstrated at the Grammys.   

It’s no question that Lamar deserved the honors of Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song. Lamar’s live representation of this political message encapsulates the body of work that he raps about in his second album To Pimp a Butterfly. He sings about the oppression of the African race in the modern day context, and further translates these personal stories into artistic masterpieces. The music video for his renowned rap song “Alright” brought Lamar on the forefront of online media because of the cinematic elements used in documenting the historical and ongoing struggles of African Americans. Lamar replicated the visual symbolism in the music video onto the main stage Monday night when he performed “Alright” by incorporating the bonfire and swift body movements. 
Lamar’s performance piggybacked Beyoncé’s cultural references in her new music video “Formation.” By displaying historical artifacts of African American culture and sharing personal narratives, Beyoncé and Lamar both articulate the voices of the oppressed through their art. 
Kendrick Lamar isn’t the voice of a single rapper. He’s the voice of millions.

Toasting up an English muffin and loading on some toppings is a smart, tasty way to fuel your morning — especially during midterms season. English muffins have many benefits. Besides being fairly low in fat and calorie content, they’re also versatile and suitable for various dishes. To add, they’re a wonderful supply of fiber and carbs to get your day going. These muffins come in multiple forms at most grocery stores. Though the original ones are great, I try to opt for high fiber or whole grain muffins whenever possible. Check out a few easy ways to top off your muffin to fuel your mornings. 
You can’t go wrong with a little bit of whole grain, protein and potassium before class. Banana pairs very well with peanut or almond butter, and putting both on your muffin gives you a good, filling combination. Lightly toast if you prefer two halves of a muffin. Spread with peanut or almond butter and top with slices of banana. This English muffin option is both easy to make and delicious to enjoy! 
At brunch the other day I ordered the avocado toast off the menu. It came with a perfectly poached egg and cantaloupe in a fancy arrangement. As delicious as it was, I have neither the time nor the money to replicate it every weekend. 
To make an easy version of this favorite, lightly toast two halves of an English muffins. Mash half to a whole avocado and spread over toasted halves. Fry or poach an egg or two. I prefer poached with this one, but poaching can be tricky — my first egg blew up in the microwave. I’ve found that gently pouring an egg into a pan filled with just boiled water, then leaving it to cook with the lid on for about five to six minutes works decently. After that, remove and place the egg over each avocado toast. Sprinkle with salt (I like garlic salt) and pepper, or feel free to add additional toppings. This muffin-avocado-egg combination is packed with protein. Add more nutrition with with some veggies on top. 
Instead of just tossing some fruit in a cup of yogurt, you can top off a half of an English muffin with your favorite greek yogurt and fresh fruit. This combination will give you some protein along with your daily dose of carbs and vitamins. Spread plain or vanilla greek yogurt on a half of an English muffin and top with your favorite fruit (berries work great). Drizzle with some honey for added sweetness!
Last note: Make sure you don’t skip breakfast during midterms. If you find yourself low on time, try these out for a sweet and smart way to help you get through your day!
