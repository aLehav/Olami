Starting August 2011, the Graduate Record Examination will be drastically revised in an attempt to reset the scoring system.
After next August, the current version of the exam — the standardized test for students applying to graduate school — will no longer be administered.
The changes are broad, affecting every section of the exam and its format.

“This is the biggest test change in the GRE’s history. Fundamentally, everything is changing — from the type of test that it is, to the scoring, to the test interface,” said Lee Weiss, assistant director of graduate programs at Kaplan, Inc., a company specializing in test preparation.
Major changes include a new point system, with each of the verbal reasoning and quantitative reasoning sections out of a maximum of 170 points, instead of 800 as it currently is.
“The reason the test-maker is making this change is because they want to make sure that small differences in scores look like small differences,” Weiss said.
Scores will vary by one-point increments, instead of 10-point increments.
“They’re [also] trying to reset the scoring scale. Right now, if you get an 800 on the math section, you’re still in the 94th percentile, so they’re trying to reset it about a mean of 150 so that scores match up with percentiles,” Weiss said.
Additionally, test-takers will now be able to skip between questions on the new GRE, which is not a feature on the current version.
The current exam, which is administered on a computer, currently adapts each subsequent question to the response on the previous question — if a student gets a question correct, the next one will be more difficult.
In the new version, however, sections, instead of questions, will be adaptive. If a student scores well on one section, the next section will be harder.
The new GRE will also be longer, by almost an hour, and contain different types of questions in all three sections: verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing.
The last major change to the GRE exam was in 2002. Test administrators replaced the logical reasoning section with a writing section, Weiss said.
Kosiso Ugwueze, a sophomore majoring in creative writing and international relations, said he plans to take the new exam when it comes out.
“I appreciate that they’re making changes. Since they’re changing [the GRE], that means that they’re evaluating it,” Ugwueze said.
Educational Testing Services, the company that administers the GRE, said the new exam will better demonstrate a student’s preparedness for graduate school.
USC officials said the exam could help evaluate a student’s application.
“It might be a good thing because it might give us a better insight into how a student is doing, as far as academics go,” said Wendy Jimenez, admissions coordinator for the USC School of Cinematic Arts.
The current exam has been in place for several years and is very predictable, according to Weiss, making the change an unpredictable one.
Zac Geoffray, a senior majoring in cinema-television  production, said he is now more wary of the new test.
“Now that I’ve heard [about the revision] I might want to take it before it changes,” Geoffray said.
To encourage students to take the new exam, a 50 percent discount is being offered to students who take the exam between Aug. 1 and Sept. 30, 2011. The test currently costs $160.

The Muslim Student Union and the Ansar Service Partnership will hold a charity event called the Hassan Hathout Fastathon on Wednesday and invite all students from any background to participate.
The FastaThon is a one-day event when Muslim students find non-Muslim volunteers to abstain from food, drink and sexual relations from sunrise to sunset, according to Ansar Service Partnership Interfaith Coordinator Sarrah Shahawy.
For each non-Muslim who agrees to participate in the event, several businesses and donors have decided to either donate a certain amount of money per volunteer or make a flat donation. The proceeds go to a non-profit organization that helps homeless communities on Skid Row.
This year, the charities receiving the Fastathon donations will be the ILM Foundation and the Coalition to Preserve Human Dignity, organizations that sponsor a yearly event called Humanitarian Day.
During this day, several organizations representing different faiths will collaborate to provide items such as clothes, food and hygiene kits to Skid Row residents, Director of Muslim Student Life Ali Mir said.
“By fasting, we are putting ourselves in the position of those who are starving and thirsty. The ILM Foundation aims to help exactly these people and show that all people deserve the same dignity and respect no matter where their path in life might have led them,” said Taha Syed, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering.
During the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast to practice self-control and learn spirituality, humility and empathy for those who go hungry every day, Shahawy said.
By holding the Fastathon, the Muslim Student Union and Ansar Service Partnership encourage other USC students to share this tradition and to help raise awareness about the hunger and poverty present not only around Los Angeles but also surrounding the USC campus, Shahawy said.
“We feel that being aware of the suffering of our community and working to alleviate it is at the heart of what it means to be Muslim and what it means to be a USC Trojan,” Shahawy said.
Students said they believe the Fastathon is a way to encourage community and individual awareness.
“To me, fasting is a great way to reflect upon my potential to be in control of my actions,” said Raza Baqai, an undeclared sophomore.
Usually, there are anywhere from 200 to 500 students across the university who participate, and all students are encouraged to pledge, no matter their background, Sahawy said.
“Based on what I saw at last year’s Fastathon, and knowing how fast the club is expanding this year, I fully expect it to be a huge event for USC students, one that encourages growth of the community and also awareness of what actions are the basis of Islam,” Syed said.
To sign up for the Fastathon, students can visit the Muslim Student Union website at uscmuslims.com and fill out the RSVP form.
It’s nice to see an article about Muslims at USC serving non-Muslims.  Awesome!
This is such a great article.  I’m glad to see fellow Trojans using their faith to serve an underprivileged community.  Fight on!

Proposition 19
A YES vote on this measure means individuals age 21 or older could, under state law, possess and cultivate limited amounts of marijuana for personal use. In addition, the state and local governments could authorize, regulate and tax commercial marijuana-related activitites under certain conditions. These activities would remain illegal under federal law.
A NO vote on this measure means the possession and cultivation of marijuana for personal use and commercial marijuana-related activities would remain illegal under state law, unless allowed under the state’s existing medical marijuana law.
Proposition 20
A YES vote on this measure means the responsibility to determine the boundaries of California’s districts in the U.S. House of Representatives would be moved to the Citizens Redistricting Commission, a commission established by Proposition 11 in 2008.
A NO vote on this measure means the responsibility to determine the boundaries of California’s districts in the U.S. House of Representatives would remain with the legislature.
Proposition 21
A YES vote on this measure means an $18 annual surcharge would be added to the amount paid when a person registers a motor vehicle. The surcharge revenues would be used to provide funding for state park and wildlife conservation programs. Vehicles subject to the surcharge would have free admission and parking at all state parks.
A NO vote on this measure means state park and wildlife conservation programs would continue to be funded through existing state and local funding sources.
Proposition 22
A YES vote on this measure means the state’s authority to use or redirect state fuel tax and local property tax revenues would be significantly restricted.
A NO vote on this measure means the state’s current authority over state fuel tax and local property tax revenues would not be affected.
Proposition 23
A YES vote on this measure means certain existing and proposed regulations authorized under state law Assembly Bill 32 to address global warming would be suspended. These regulations would remain suspended until the state unemployment rate drops to 5.5 percent or lower for one year.
A NO vote on this measure means the state could continue to implement the measures authorized under A.B. 32 to address global warming.
Proposition 24
A YES vote on this measure means three business tax provisions will return to what they were before 2008 and 2009 law changes. As a result, a business will be less able to deduct losses in one year against income in other years; a multistate business will have its California income determined by a calculation using three factors; and a business will not be able to share tax credits with related businesses.
A NO vote on this measure means three business tax provisions that were recently changed will not be affected.
Proposition 25
A YES vote on this measure means the legislature’s vote requirement to send the annual budget bill to the governor would be lowered from two-thirds to a majority of each house of the legislature.
A NO vote on this measure means the legislature’s vote requirement to send an annual budget bill to the governor would remain unchanged at two-thirds of each house of the legislature.
Proposition 26
A YES vote on this measure means the definition of taxes would be broadened to include many payments currently considered to be fees or charges. As a result, more state and local proposals to increase revenues would require approval by two-thirds of each house of the Legislature or by local voters.
A NO vote on this measure means current constitutional requirements regarding fees and taxes would not be changed.
Proposition 27
A YES vote on this measure means the responsibility to determine the boundaries of State Legislature and Board of Equalization districts would be returned to the Legislature. The Citizens Redistricting Commission, established by Proposition 11 in 2008 to perform this function, would be eliminated. (Proposition 20 on this ballot also concerns redistricting issues. If both Proposition 27 and Proposition 20 are approved by voters, the proposition receiving the greater number of yes votes would be the only one to go into effect.)
A NO vote on this measure means the responsibility to determine the boundaries of Legislature and Board of Equalization districts would remain with the Citizens Redistricting Commission.
Spell Check Much?
Proposition 19 ‘activitites’ should be ‘activities.’
But I sure am glad the DT Editors are supporting Gov. Moonbeam…

A student sustained injuries after falling from the sixth floor of Birnkrant Residential College early Monday morning, according to Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
In an e-mail sent to some Birnkrant residents, the student was identified as Jackson Roddy, a freshman majoring in accounting.
Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics and the Los Angeles Police Department responded to the scene at about 6 a.m.
DPS officers were on the scene where freshman Jackson Roddy fell Monday morning in front of Birnkrant Residential College. The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the cause. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
Roddy was transferred to California Hospital, and doctors have been working to stabilize him and assess his injuries, according to Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson.  
“Right now, what everyone is focusing on is his health and his recovery,” Jackson said, adding that Roddy’s parents are with their son.
The cause of the fall is still being investigated by LAPD, Carlisle said, though a university statement said foul play is not suspected.
Roddy is pledging Sigma Nu fraternity. Brian Huefner, the president of Sigma Nu, said he is working to ensure other fraternity members receive counseling and support.
“The first piece of action was to make sure everyone was aware,” Huefner said. “We’re staying by each other. Everyone’s really shooken up.”
The university encourages all students to seek counseling if needed and said it is reaching out to those who might have been affected by the incident. Four counselors have been designated specifically to the Birnkrant dorm, the statement said.
“We’ve reached out to his roommate and other students in Birnkrant,” Jackson said.
Birnkrant is an eight-story building with seven floors of student housing primarily for freshmen students.
Students can contact Student Affairs at (213) 740-2421 or the USC Student Counseling Services at (213) 740-7711.
“Our thoughts and prayers go to the student and his family,” Jackson said in the university statement.
Sigma Nu will host a prayer vigil for Roddy at 9:30 p.m. in front of the fraternity’s house on The Row.

The 2010 Good Neighbors Campaign has concluded its official efforts; however, the program will continue accepting donations through the end of the year in hopes of reaching its expanded campaign goal of $1.3 million, an increase of $100,000 from last year.
At the end of the month-long campaign, Good Neighbors was about $150,000 short of its goal. The campaign can get as much as 15 percent of its donations after the set deadline of Oct. 31, however, and potential donors are encouraged to give even after the deadline has passed, says Campaign Director Carolina Castillo.
“This campaign tends to drag out a little longer, so … we’re heading in the right direction to meet our goal,” Castillo said.
Castillo said there were many reasons for this year’s higher goal.
“The economy is still struggling, so local nonprofits are definitely feeling the impact,” Castillo said. “The needs of our communities [also] evolve and change.”
This year, the campaign had more than 500 donors who pledged to donate 1 percent of their salaries to the campaign. These donors become members of the President’s Leadership Circle, and President C.L. Max Nikias will host a dinner at his house for them later in the year.
Castillo said that Nikias added a new energy to the campaign and was extremely supportive of the effort.
The campaign benefits a number of organizations in the USC community. Past recipients include Troy Camp, the USC Thornton Outreach Program and the 32nd Street/USC Magnet School.
“Most [of the funding] goes directly to camp, for renting the facility, getting supplies and other costs,” said Maxine Welcome, co-executive director of Troy Camp. “We try and keep our costs down throughout the year to put almost all of the money toward [the week of] camp.”
The theme for the year was “A Tradition of Giving.” Castillo said the theme represents the Trojan Family’s strong commitment to supporting its communities.
“USC has a tradition of giving through public service, through research [and] through teaching, so we thought that [the theme] would be a nice way to recognize the university’s efforts — outreach efforts that have been going on for decades,” Castillo said.
“I really love that we, as a university, are always working to better our relationship with the community,” Welcome said.
“I think that is something really unique about that, and it’s something that we take pride in.”
Castillo said that it was important for the campaign to try and fully address communities’ needs. She said the campaign allows for stronger relations between the university and its communities, and it allows students to practice what they’re learning in the classroom.
“Dental, pharmacy, business students can all take what they’re learning and apply it to real, lifelike situations — real life problems,” she said.
Castillo said the program focused on increasing the number of campaign leaders and held an orientation for these leaders to get them motivated and teach them how to promote the campaign in their respective areas.
Leaders were in charge of promoting the campaign and raising funds in their respective departments on campus. Fundraising techniques for the campaign varied from department to department.
This year, fundraising efforts included carnivals, auctions and raffles. Prizes for donors included an iPad, Wii games, autographed items and weekend hotel stays.
The Dean of the USC Libraries, Catherine Quinlan, put out a fundraising challenge to the university. Participating departments will have their names entered in a raffle, with a grand prize of $15,000 in additional funding for their department.
“[Campaign leaders] are really the key to the campaign — to making it successful, to informing and educating others about campaign, and to educating others about the works that it makes possible,” Castillo said.
This type of support and encouragement for the campaign is vital, she said.
The Good Neighbors Campaign will begin accepting grant applications for next year in the spring, and grants will be awarded in April.

The first season of the Michael Cooper era didn’t go quite as planned.
Despite posting a 19-12 record and advancing to the Pac-10 conference semifinals, the USC women’s basketball team was not selected to play in the NCAA tournament. The snub left a bitter taste in the team’s mouth, which declined an invitation to participate in the less prestigious National Invitational Tournament.
“It was a little heartbreaking, but we put the decision in the selection committee’s hands and we’re not doing that this year,” said junior guard Ashley Corral.
On the rise · Senior guard Jacki Gemelos shoots over a UCLA defender last season. The senior helped lead the Women of Troy to a 19-12 record in 2009, creating high expectations to be set for the upcoming season. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
This season, the team expects more out of itself. Cooper, in his second year at the helm, said the players and staff have more familiarity with each other.
“I think as a team and as coaches we know each other [better],” Cooper said. “They understand our philosophy now, so I’m looking for bigger and brighter things.”
Any improvement the team sees will result from an intense off-season spent training. Senior guard Jacki Gemelos said every player on the team stayed in Los Angeles this summer to work on her game, and junior guard Briana Gilbreath said the team used last season as motivation during the off-season.
“The fact that we need to determine our own fate this year is what made us work so hard,” Gilbreath said.
To get there, the Women of Troy will face a number of challenges.
Just reaching last season’s win total will be an accomplishment. The Women of Troy compiled a record of 12-6 in conference play last season, a mark that will be difficult to duplicate. Making matters worse, the Women of Troy lost several important contributors this season, including guard Hailey Dunham and guard/forward Aarika Hughes.
“Aarika was our biggest vocal leader, so a lot of us have tried to pick up that slack,” Gemelos said. “It isn’t easy replacing her.”
Still, the team returns its core group of players. The team leaders are Corral (15.1 ppg, 5.0 apg) and Gilbreath (15.1 ppg, 5.9 rpg), who both earned All Pac-10 honors as sophomores. Gilbreath was also named the conference’s Co-Defensive Player of the Year.
“I’m going to go out there and stop anybody who needs to be stopped,” Gilbreath said. “Helping out my teammates on defense and offense — whatever I need to do.”
Other key contributors include senior center Kari LaPlante and Gemelos, who has struggled with injuries since arriving at USC five years ago. The senior guard, who said her game is starting to come back as she returns from a fourth knee surgery, will be counted on to provide the Women of Troy with another playmaker in the backcourt.
“With Ashley and I being creators I think it’s going to open things up for everybody else,” she said.
Sophomore forward Christina Marinacci also returns with a year under her belt after receiving Pac-10 All-Freshman Honorable Mention.
Along with these players, the Women of Troy brought in a nationally ranked recruiting class that Cooper said he believes will make an immediate impact.
“[Freshman forward Cassie] Harberts will definitely come in and contribute with some size underneath and a basketball IQ that is out of this world,” Cooper said. “[Freshman guard] Len’Nique Brown will give us a legitimate backup point guard that can create some offense for us in transition.”
Cooper is not the only one impressed with the new additions. Gemelos expects Harberts, one of the top recruits in the country, to contend for Pac-10 Freshman of the Year.
“I think [Cassie] is that good,” she said. “It’s really nice to have another post presence inside for us guards.”
Along with Harberts and Brown, the team also welcomes new faces in forward Desiree Bradley, center Lauren White and forward Thaddesia Southall.
“We have a lot of great, new talent coming in and they should mold well with the team,” LaPlante said.
With plenty of able-bodied freshmen and a healthy roster to begin the season, the Women of Troy should be able to utilize their depth. Last year, injuries plagued the team and forced the starters to log heavy minutes. Corral and Gilbreath both averaged more than 30 minutes per game, and Corral played the entire game on numerous occasions.
“The main issue was us being healthy last year,” LaPlante said. “We had so many injuries, but now we have everybody coming back.”
Redshirt sophomore guard Stefanie Gilbreath has also dealt with injuries during her career, having undergone three knee surgeries. She is expected to make her USC debut early this season, and the person most excited to see her back on the court is her younger sister, Briana.
“It’s going to mean the world to me,” Briana Gilbreath said. “I can’t wait to get on the court with her again. Every time we’re out there together it’s like magic, so I’m excited.”
The Women of Troy will also have some new coaches on the sidelines as well in Laura Beeman and Cooper’s son, Michael Cooper II. Cooper said he wanted a staff that he was comfortable with and could teach the players.
“I’ve coached with Laura Beeman before and she’s from a winning program at Mt. Sac,” he said. “She’s been around a college atmosphere and I think she’ll come in and add some credibility as a coach that knows the Xs and Os.”
With plenty of change in the offseason, the Women of Troy now get a new start to their season, where they can work to slowly build upon last year’s success.
Despite all that happened last year, the Women of Troy look poised to improve upon last season and make a strong push for a Pac-10 title and a NCAA tournament bid. Still, the players know they cannot overlook any opponent.
“We need to win games we should win,” LaPlante said. “We’ve put in a lot of work this summer so we control our own destiny.”
USC kicks off its season Nov. 9 at 7 p.m. with an exhibition game against Biola. The team’s home opener is Nov. 12 at 1 p.m. against Gonzaga at the Galen Center.

The Coliseum crowd was electric.
The fans had not created this kind of atmosphere for a USC home game in a long time. Maybe it was because No. 1 Oregon was in town, the first time a top-ranked team has visited the Coliseum since 1988.
Wide open · While crowds initially fill the Coliseum on Saturdays, USC has consistently dealt with dwindling attendance late in their games. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
Excitement was in the air. The Trojans, especially the defense, were feeding off this crowd. Every defensive stop garnered a roar from the 88,726 fans in attendance. People were on their feet for every third down, seemingly willing to stand by the Trojans until the end.
That is, until the middle of the third quarter, when the USC crowd fell silent and watched as the Trojans submitted to Oregon’s nation-leading offense.
The crowd looked as fatigued as the Trojans did on the field. The Ducks were so exhausting, they drained the passion right out of the Trojan faithful.
By the fourth quarter, even with USC down only two scores, the stadium began to empty. Never was it more important for Trojan fans to stick by their team; instead, they threw in the towel and headed for the parking lots and the parties.
This doesn’t happen in the Southeastern Conference. It is unheard of for home fans to leave even a mildly close game before the final whistle.
But for some reason at USC, whether it’s a lopsided win or loss or even a close game, it does not matter. The USC stadium is half-empty by the end.
Other fan bases stand up on every play during a big game, not just on third down. I was at the Nebraska-Miami national championship game in 2002 and noticed the Nebraska fans sitting behind me were on their feet for every bit of the action.
I assumed that was because of the stakes of the game but the Nebraska fans assured me that this was normal. No matter who Nebraska was playing, they never sat down while the game was in action.
I couldn’t believe it. As a 13-year-old, I had already been to dozens of home USC games and never did I see that kind of passion. I was used to a stadium of 90,000-plus people, 60,000 of whom were there more to say they’d been there, and maybe only 30,000 total who really cared.
Then last Saturday, I thought I saw it. I had never seen anything like it at the Coliseum, the entire stadium weaving and chanting together, the taste of the upset within its grasp.
But just as soon as it had come, it was gone, as fast as you could say LaMichael James. The Trojans did not quit on the field, but USC fans definitely quit on the Trojans.
Of course, what happens on the field, not in the stands, decides who walks away the winner. The players must sway the momentum so the crowd can feed off it.
But a real home-field advantage occurs when the crowd can build that momentum for itself: when noise translates to support, when 90,000 people can motivate 11 young men by repeatedly reminding them that they believe.
This is not to say that the outcome of the game would have been any different if the crowd had stayed around. By all means, an Oregon victory was assured by the middle of the fourth quarter when sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley threw his second interception.
Most USC fans had decided it more prudent to beat traffic or start the partying by this point.
Maybe the Coliseum is too big a place to expect every person in attendance to be a never-say-die fanatic. Maybe Los Angeles is too much of a happening place to expect people to sit through an entire football game.
Whatever the cause, it is the reason there will never be a true home-field advantage at the Coliseum. The Trojans once won 35 consecutive home games, but that was never about the stadium or the fans. It was always about the Trojans on the field.
Now that sanctions will prevent the Trojans from being what they were last decade, whatever mystique the Coliseum had will evaporate because the crowds that attend USC home games are just not going to stick by a losing team.
No Trojan is going to blame the crowd for the team’s performance, but they must recognize the importance of fan support.
“It seems like [we had a rhythm] only the first quarter and the third quarter, where we were rocking and you could tell the stadium was in it,” sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said. “Finishing I think is what we didn’t do.”
Neither did the USC crowd.

I am back. I have done research, and I have learned much. USC is jealous that they have to share a acronym with U. South Carolina. It is why you guys cheat to distinguish your team. I have also acquired the knowledge of Barkley. He stinks worse than the leaking sewer pipes in that ghetto you call home. I wouldn’t let my kid sisters pet rat visit USC for risk that it would get mugged, or worse yet hang out with you losers. Evidence you ask? Easy, you morons correct each other on spelling on blogs…IDOITS! Oregon fans are way more classy than you dirtbags! Your mascot does not compare. Jobs? My name is Jobes bitch, who said I need jobs. Oregon is the truth, our girls are even hotter. Your girls are alright, but they would be better of quitting school and working the corners on that ghetto you scumbags live in. Who knows maybe I’ll pimp a couple of ‘um. Feels good to be Guy Jobes, fan of the best team ever!
Ducks are what it’s all about, your luck just ran out! (cheaters)
So your research missed the University of Oklahoma?
I agree that fans should stay through the last play of the game, and I am one of those fans.  I am also one of the 40,000 who sat through every play of the Paul Hackett era.
I understand what you are saying about Nebraska and their loyal fans, but it is easy to glorify them from afar.  I went to the USC-Nebraska game in Lincoln, where the Trojans throttled the Huskers.  The Nebraska fans exited the stadium early in the 4th quarter.  The same thing happened with Oklahoma fans in our National Championship game in Miami.  I doubt that 10% of the Sooners were there for the last play.
It is always great when something exciting happens at the end of one of those game, such as the touchdown against UCLA last year.  You never know what is going to happen, so stay to support the team.  Fight On!
Guy Jobes,
Sounds more like Blow Jobes.  Anyways, I bet you Junior College guys at “O”U, I mean Zero U  will never  understand what being a champion is all about. Your Ducks can go undefeated this season but you will never be a champion in my book because you need to have class to be a champion and that you don’t have.  By the way, you ever notice that Duck and Suck rhyme? Quote me…..the time will come when Oregon becomes Oregone!
Aloha, Dude.  Fight On!
Very well put, Trojan Faithful.
Oregon fans are vulgar, rude, obnoxious, and live in an area in the country where it’s OK to interbreed among the folks in the community.  Ya know what they say about folks who live in the Northwest?  It’s where the men are men, the women are too, and the sheep are nervous!
I frequently travel to the NW, and I must say, other than there are  lot of trees and greenery, ….  well, that’s bout it.
Oh, I’ve been to Eugene.  One of my very best friend’s father was a US Senator from there.  I love my friend to death and would do anything for her, bu the average population’s IQ in that state is that of  lackluster bRuin.  You prents and grandparents smoke wayyyy too much pot, and dropped too many tabs of acid in their day….  they ruined the gene pool for you all.  Go back to the commune, learn to live off the land, because there ren’t any jobs up their and your alumni association isn’t going to hire you either.  
One more thing… the more you trash talk about us, the better we feel about it, because, your arrogant attitudes just indicate to us that you’re jealous, wish you had what we have, and are hoping that the SC program doesn’t regroup over the next few years to take down all Pac-12 teams.  Our time is gonna come, and it’s in sight.  Enjoy your new-found winning streak, now, while you can.  Like Christmas, and that’s how you’re acting, it’ll soon be over!
Fight On brothers and sisters!
Beat the Sun Devils.
Hey Greg, if your going to represent a great institution like USC, maybe tomorrow you might pay more attention in your spelling class. The correct spelling for prents, (parents) and bout should be (about),or maybe just show up for class will probably do. But anyway,I’m a big fan of USC football I have great respect for the program and I hope they get things going in the right direction soon.I had a good time attending the game down there, and was treated with respect from the Trojan fans.One last thing, we don’t smoke pot or do acid anymore up here. We now are getting high on “Quack”……remember Greg you need to learn how to “Win The Day”, be nice.    Have a nice day……………..
The Trojans played their best game of the year against the number one team in the nation. Even tho it was a losing effort, it doesn’t take away the merits of a truly great game. Since when do Trojans make excuses for a loss? The team shouldn’t need the crowd to perform, EVER! I am not a fair weather fan, screw the band wagon! USC forever! The Trojans have nothing to play for other than pride, thanks to the knuckleheads at the NCAA. Punishing people who had NOTHING to do with Reggie Bush’s misdeeds is unjust. USC will regain our greatness on the field again. Until then, GO USC! FIGHT ON!
Hey Stephen,I totally agree that the present USC football program shouldn’t be punished for something that happened a while back. And I will betcha that these type of violations are still going on with other programs in the country,just they haven’t been caught yet. But that’s all you can do is fill the stands, and support your team, because it will get better in time.
During the end of the Paul Hackett era the stadium was empty from start to finish. There were only about 40,000 fans in the stands and of those 40,000 about 34,000 were Trojan fans. Then Pete Carroll turned things around and Trojan tickets became coveted again. How did the University repay those loyal fans that supported the Trojans through the toughest of times? They cut the number of season tickets they could renew, pushed them up in the stands and away from the 50 yard line to accommodate the “band wagon” fans with money who wanted those prized seats. Now that the decade of dominance is over, the band wagon fans will turn their backs on the Trojans and those loyal 35,000 will be needed again. If you treat this emotional game like a business your fans will be customers, not loyal fans who will support the team whatever the outcome is. The university needs to be loyal to those who are loyal to them. If the university continues to cater to the band wagon fans that only will pay top dollar to see a winner, this is the type of support our team will get. To quote the bible “you reap what you sow.”
Ducks = Nouveau Riche.  It’s always the newly rich who have the worst behavior.  Hang around the old money folks for a bit and learn something.  Here’s a Jeopardy quiz for you.  Answer: 24.  
Question: How many Rose Bowls has USC won?
Why so many ducks around here. Don’t they have their own bl-O-g.?
1957 grad of USC.  NE season ticket holder since 1968.  NE fans are the greatest . All fan bases could learn from them.  I love my Trojans and living in this football rabid state is just a pleasure.  The Pete Carroll era was so great and Trojans will rise again to the great heights. Pat Haden was a great hire.   Remember we always have our Song Girls and a wonderful horse.   FIGHT ON
Dear Condom Enthusiast,
Where there is smoke, there is fire. I am an Oregon alum. We won the Rose Bowl in 1917, so get your facts straight. Fight on? Why, where are you going? USC is a good school, but who would want to live in that hellhole of a neighborhood anyway. Anyway, I retract my negative statement regarding this blog. I do like this blog. It is fun to watch cheaters get what they deserve. Thanks for passing the torch, hopefully it has not been too damaged by the crimes that have occurred on your team.
Go Ducks! USC Sucks!
Jobes,
1917 it was the pac 8 you dumbass. Fight On is an expression you Oregonian hippie. Much more clever than “O” There you go again with that cheating crap, once your school gets anywhere near us in sports or academics historically come talk to us. How’s that Oregon degree treating you? no job? yeah didn’t think so. Explains why you’re on this site you have nothing better to do. Living in a hell hole? First off we live, on campus, therefore its not in a hell hole you dumbass. Secondly, we still are a better school than yours even with our location…shows how much Oregon has going for them… And crimes? again your an idiot its a crime… what last time I checked how was masoli doing you hypocritical duck…at least reggie was good enough to make it count masoli was just stupid to steal hahaha
Fight On!
Maybe if your team wasn’t a lying, cheating, scumhole for the last ten years, with a coach who was willing to jump off the ship before the boat sank. Admit it, you guys are the white collar criminals of college football, now you got caught, what’s there to be excited about when your fans only like to win while cheating. 
Everyone hates your team and this whiny, trashy blog.
Go Ducks! USC sucks!
Guy Jobes,
You lack so much sense its unbearable. First, off get your facts right. Our TEAM was not cheating, neither was our school. A PLAYER was so called, “cheating” nonetheless, the university had nothing to do with it. Reggie was driving an impala that was being paid off in payments, therefore, no one could have known from the naked eye. Check your facts idiot! Secondly, how are we white collard criminals? we have 1 player in our history caught of wrong doing and now we are everyone’s demise? please…get your facts straight again. If you want to criticize a program go criticize ohio st for maurice clarrett, or UNC for their 9 players, or how about Miami for their drug busts in the 1990’s. Now I know you probably went to a mid level or even public school college, or maybe you have yet to graduate from your Junior College, but don’t go bashing a top 25 ranked school academically and athletically for consistently running the PAC 10. You know that “O” Oregon prides on…well it means: 0 heismans, 0 national titles, and 0 rose bowls. Also you claim everyone hates this blog…my question is then why are you on here? Again, have fun at your Junior college and tell me how living off the streets go. Lastly, don’t hate us cuz you aint us…FIGHT ON
Hey Trojan Faithful, you left out one more  “O” meaning, it also stands for zero NCAAFB violations…….

Days after Athletic Director Pat Haden announced the construction of a $70-million athletic complex, USC coaches and athletes reacted to the news in a way that many people might expect — with excitement.
“Heritage Hall is one of a kind. It’s a landmark, but I think we’ve outgrown it,” sophomore track and field team member Farren Benjamin said.
At 110,000 square feet, the two-story complex will give the department more space than the current 70,000-square-foot Heritage Hall, the current hub of the athletic department. Considering that Heritage Hall will also remain in use, the complex will provide plenty of room for USC’s 21 sports teams to grow.
The new space will include an academic center, study rooms, a training room and a 32,000-square-foot weight room. It will also house meeting spaces, offices and a locker room for the football program.
“I think it’s a great thing, not only for the football program but for the school. USC has always had a great tradition of excellence and now [we’ll] have a great facility,” sophomore football safety T.J. McDonald said. “We’re going to have a nice locker room … the academic facilities, that’ll be good as far as tutoring goes.”
The new facility might give student-athletes more resources, but it doesn’t mean that Heritage Hall, which opened in 1971, will be forgotten. The facility will allow for a reallocation of space in Heritage Hall for athletic department staff, an expansion of the equipment room and a new lounge for student-athletes.
“It is a really special place to me and to a lot of athletes, and I don’t think this [new facility] will replace it, but it will be a great addition,” Benjamin said.
Giving the athletic department more space is a project that has been long overdue, players said.
“[The athletic facility] is totally necessary considering our university has the top athletic programs across all sports,” junior tennis player Alison Ramos said.
Construction is slated to begin in January, and is expected to take about 18 months to complete. The wait will be worth it, many said, for several reasons.
“I think any time you can bring a state-of-the-art facility to any department, you are going to have immediate returns on that,” USC women’s soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “The type of support we get will only improve, the type of work we can do down there can only improve.”

Chant disrespects school, tradition
As an alumna who now lives on the East Coast, I have to settle to watch USC football games on my TV instead of inside the historic Coliseum.
I’ve never been a fan of the “Hey, you suck” chant during football games because it exhibits an extreme lack of good sportsmanship.
However, I am now completely embarrassed to say that the current students have taken the chant to the next level.
I was confused when, as I was watching last weekend’s Homecoming game, my TV’s sound kept cutting out. As I listened more intently, I realized that it was because students had added a simple word to the end of that chant, which ABC then censored. I was absolutely appalled and contacted a local friend of mine to confirm the change in the chant.
Please tell me where this kind of chant falls into the qualities that we, as Trojans, attempt to exemplify: “faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous and ambitious?”
One of my favorite things about going to USC games is to see that alumni of every age, young and old, remain faithful in their dedication of all things USC. How then do you think they feel hearing that sort of chant coming from the student section? How do we change this behavior? Do we even want to?
Change shouldn’t come from a request by our university officials. Change shouldn’t come from the parents of our students trying to impart a “be nice to others” philosophy.  Change should be driven by you — our current students.
I hope that this letter does not fall on deaf ears. I hope that current students are embarrassed by their peers and refuse to be a bystander to this type of behavior and language.
We are all proud of our university, both students and alumni, and it hurts all of us to have our university’s traditions and reputation trashed by chanting “Hey, you suck dick.”
Fight On!

Prop. 19 isn’t clear road to legalization
Looking at marijuana prohibition from a strategic level, it becomes clear that legalizing marijuana in California will have a devastating effect on federal marijuana law enforcement.
During Prohibition, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New York, Massachusetts, California, Wisconsin and eight other states repealed or modified their alcohol prohibition laws, leaving the burden of enforcement of Prohibition to federal authorities.
There was nothing the feds could do to compel state cooperation with federal Prohibition because there is no constitutional requirement that states must duplicate or enforce federal legislation. The fact that states cannot be compelled to enforce federal legislation is well-established constitutional law.
The promises of Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, U.S. Attorney Gen. Eric Holder, Steve Cooley and others to continue enforcing marijuana laws after Proposition 19 passes are empty threats.
Although state laws cannot repeal federal statutes, there’s no way states can be forced to enforce federal marijuana prohibition. Currently 98 percent of federal pot cases come from investigations and tips done by local law enforcement. Proposition 19 will end all California law enforcement cooperation with federal marijuana prohibition.
Since the Drug Enforcement Administration only has about 5,000 agents worldwide, the feds will be unable to enforce their pot laws in California without local help after Proposition 19 passes. The DEA will only be able to make token raids.
When two or three states follow California’s lead, federal marijuana prohibition will be deader than King Tut’s cat.
The feds might have their “law,” but they will not be able to enforce it after Proposition 19 passes.
Vote yes on proposition 19.

Lindsey,
As a current USC undergraduate, I completely agree with you. I have never been a fan of the chant and find it extremely vulgar and disrespectful. Usually only a few students say the last part, and it is always very awkward and embarrassing. I don’t know how it can be stopped, but I am glad you wrote this letter and hope that more students read it!

Some causes are just perpetually in the limelight: Earthquakes. Budget crises. Lindsay Lohan.
These days, it’s hip to wax eco-friendly, which explains some of the uproar on campus surrounding Proposition 23, the motion to repeal California’s 2006 Air Pollution Control Law (A.B. 32).
Sandwich boards were worn proudly. Fliers were distributed aggressively. Free California Public Interest Research Group T-shirts reading “VOTE NO Prop 23” were stuffed into the bicycle baskets of unsuspecting students while they were in class, probably learning the policy strategy that led to the proposition being put on the ballot in the first place.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Today, eligible students will hopefully flock to their nearest designated voting areas to decide Proposition 23’s fate.
Most will probably have worked through any confusion by the time they head to the voting booths. But if they haven’t, it would certainly be understandable.
The information moderate voters might have perused in order to be swayed one way or the other is complicated, to say the least.
For instance, the California Official Voter Information Guide, which includes pros and cons to each proposition, has a testimonial from the American Lung Association in California that reads, “Prop. 23 would result in more air pollution that would lead to more asthma and lung disease, especially in children and seniors. Vote NO.”
A few paragraphs lower: “Proposition 23 doesn’t weaken or repeal the hundreds of laws that protect the environment, reduce air pollution, keep our water clean and protect public health. Proposition 23 applies to greenhouse gas emissions, which the California Air Resources Board concedes ‘have no direct public health impacts.’”
In situations where both parties are at least partially right, it’s hard to know who’s more right. Proposition 23 is not the Pandora’s box of pollution and oil company porkbarrel that its opponents make it out to be, nor is A.B. 32 the financial black hole bemoaned by the proposition’s supporters.
What gives Proposition 23’s opponents the edge is a combination of a crucial provision buried within the text of A.B. 32 and the potential of the green job market in California down the road.
In “Miscellaneous Provisions,” A.B. 32 states that “In the event of extraordinary circumstances, catastrophic events or threat of significant economic harm the governor may adjust the applicable deadlines for individual regulations, or for the state in the aggregate, to the earliest feasible date after that deadline.”
This means that if A.B. 32 proved too unmanageable a strain on California’s economy, as Proposition 23’s supporters suspect it might, it could be suspended for a period of one year while the governor assesses the best way to maintain it without damaging the economy, budget and job market.
Thus, voting no on Proposition 23 does not sentence California to go down with a sinking piece of legislation, should A.B. 32 prove possible in the long run only at the expense of the state budget.
Then there’s the green jobs market. Skeptics and non-believers have doggedly reminded us that alternative energy jobs in California compose a meager 1 percent of the state workforce.
To base a vote against Proposition 23 upon the argument that green jobs make up for the burden A.B. 32 places on our economy is naïve. But a more logical, big-picture approach to California economics seems to justify A.B. 32 as well. The green jobs market has skyrocketed by more than 36 percent in the last 15 years, leapfrogging the growth rate of the entire state labor force.
Clearly this isn’t enough to salvage California’s economy and high unemployment rate on its own, but consider how obscure a field alternative energy was 15 years ago, and how much publicity and funding it receives today.
As the public becomes increasingly disenchanted with the nation’s dependence on oil, and as its savvy about the consequences of pollution grows, alternative energy only picks up more speed.
There’s a reason that the words “alternative energy” and “future” are thrown together as often as they are. It might not be California’s breadwinner at the moment, but it’s not unreasonable to think that laws like A.B. 32 will end up paying for themselves, if not as soon as we might like them too.
It’s also hard to get around the fact that Proposition 23 will only reinstate A.B. 32 when California’s unemployment rate dips below 5.5 percent, something that will be accomplished in roughly the same time frame as Meg Whitman winning the majority of the Latino vote.
Proposition 23 isn’t a cut and dried issue. As Whitman, who opposes the proposition, has proven, it’s not as simple as voting along party lines, and it’s not just a matter of deciding whether your allegiances lie with the economy or with the environment.
Many voters will likely recall only the fliers and the sandwich boards and reflexively vote no. But they should also be apprised of what exactly the proposition means for the future of California.
We have to take the leap of faith with alternative energy and green agendas eventually — if we abandon them every time the economy is struggling, we’ll never get any decisive environmental policy off the ground. The safety net in A.B. 32 gives us a chance to explore how the regulation will play out without tying policymakers’ hands or handicapping the struggle against unemployment.
At least for now.

I’ve already voted NO ON PROP 26
I’ve already voted NO ON PROP 23
Eventually our economy will recover from “The free market will regulate itself”, and
at that time there will be more jobs either way, but the choice really becomes
do we focus on a future that is as long lasting as sun rises or as dead end as dinosaur juice.
Move forward.
There’s a reason “green jobs” and “future” are often linked – clean technology and clean jobs are the fastest growing industry in California.   Not too long ago, they said computer technology was just a “niche market” for geeks who wanted to play around, and Facebook was this local idea to get girls.  When it’s a good idea, it explodes!  And, a clean environment and green jobs are a great idea, and a big win-win!  Vote NO on Prop 23!
I hope everyone will vote NO on Prop 23 today. Right now California has an edge in the global clean energy economy and is positioned to compete with China and the European nations that are already ahead of the United States in transitioning to clean energy. Clean energy jobs in California grew by 5 percent during the recession while overall jobs declined. But Prop 23 would take away that edge and send us back for many more years at the  beck and call of the oil and gas companies. If you want a clean energy, good jobs future, vote NO on Prop 23!
Do you students not want to have any jobs available in this state at all? Then by all means vote no on 23.
The science isn’t even there to support the draconian measure of AB 32.
PROP 26 is just as destructive as PROP 23. Prop 26 is a treacherous, Big Oil rip-off, which “passes the buck”  from oil corporation, clean-up fees to the taxpayer, who will pay the oil recycling fees, the materials hazards fees and other fees. If you do not understand the ambiguities and the intrigues behind Prop 26, then, vote no. Power to the people. Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell are silent partners behind prop 26.

If you weren’t partying, trick-or-treating or otherwise gallivanting at 10 p.m. on Halloween night, chances are the television was on. And for 5.3 million people, AMC was the channel to watch.
Dead or alive · As with the comic series, The Walking Dead details Rick Grimes’ (Andrew Lincoln) attempts to survive a zombie outbreak. - Photos courtesy of AMC 
The cable television channel took on the richly detailed, psychologically probing series The Walking Dead. Bringing to life the characters of Robert Kirkman’s comic series of the same name, the show revolves around the aftermath of a zombie outbreak. The pilot was an episode that would appeal to comic book and Halloween lovers alike, balancing a faithful account of the comic book with the right amount of zombie facetime.
But the series expands beyond that. Since Kirkman’s first issue back in 2003, the tone of the story was clear. Kirkman’s intent is not to spook people in cliché Halloween fashion but instead to dig deeper into the idea of someone being trapped in a world chock-full of zombies.
“This book is more about watching [protagonist Rick Grimes] survive than it is about watching zombies pop around the corner and scare you,” Kirkman explained in the introduction to Days Gone Bye, the first volume in the series and aptly the title of the first episode.
The psychological thrill carries over very well in the show’s first episode. Adapted to the screen by director Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption), the  television series takes the liberty of including material not in the original work.
The pilot starts off with Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), the lone sheriff deputy of a petite Southern town who wakes from a coma to find the world has gone to hell. The opening scene finds him wandering amid abandoned vehicles. As he crouches to look underneath a car, the camera begins to control and experiment with point of view in classic horror film fashion.
Here the audience has tunnel vision as two skinny legs, with the feet in a pair of filthy bunny slippers, slowly move within Grimes’ view. A pale hand reaches down and grasps a white plush bunny lying alone on the bare ground. Grimes tries to help what he thinks is a little girl but instead encounters a zombie, her face bloody and distorted, and kills her with one clean shot to the head.
The flashback creates a different mood in the beginning of the story, though one that remains true to the original intent. The Walking Dead follows the events in Grimes’ story in strictly chronological order, beginning with the car chase that lands him in a deep coma.
In doing so, the series maintains the comic’s tone while avoiding a strict reproduction of scenes. Here, the audience immediately realizes the sad reality that the disease spared no victims and that Grimes had no choice but to shoot the girl.
This technique is echoed later in the episode, the most important display seen in the inclusion of a female zombie that never existed in the series — the wife and mother of the Jones family.
Here, the audience watches the heart-wrenching struggle of father Morgan Jones and his young son Duane as the woman they love transforms into a zombie they fear.
Part of the strength of the comic was Kirkman’s ability to make readers stop and wonder what they would do if events similar to the comic happened in real life. Darabont takes this idea further by making the audience question the possibilities of a loved one becoming a zombie.
In general, the camera can take more liberties than comic books to create the effects in which movies and television shows specialize in. Here we get the full effect of the zombie state of being and the makeup artists do an excellent job of recreating illustrator Tony Moore’s hauntingly detailed work in the comic.
The zombies are shown in various states of decay and the bright color of fake blood assails audiences in various scenes, including a lengthy cut of zombies eating a horse as an upbeat song plays paradoxically in the background.
Yet, as with any adaptation, the question is: Will it stay true to the intent of the material, or will the blaring brightness of production lights create an overblown version of an otherwise sound and good story?
In this case, the camera works to the advantage of Kirkman’s vision by embracing the purpose and message of the comic books and also takes the time to do what they cannot.
The lingering images force the viewer to keep his gaze on the face of the suffering zombie, showing the blood spewing from its dead brains in slow motion while its fingers of a zombie slide on barbed wire, and the camera pans out from the street to show the complete infestation of the city Grimes once knew.
For zombie fans, comic book aficionados and those thirsting for more of the Halloween spirit, the show must — and will — go on. The visceral first episode managed to serve as a strong and sincere snapshot of the world Kirkman created in his comic book series.
Though fans of any series might feel hesitant about a television adaptation of a beloved series — past examples have not exactly been great translations, such as Birds of Prey or Smallville — The Walking Dead proves that the right combination of solid acting and attention to the original work’s intent can result in a riveting television show that appeals to original fans and newcomers alike.
The next few Sundays at 10 p.m. will tell whether the series can meet the expectations set by the first episode or will fail to fully capture Grimes’ fantastical journey.

Good Charlotte has seen much success over the years, beginning with its first two records that garnered much support from both the pop and punk communities.
Heartbeat · Good Charlotte’s latest album is a fast-paced record where even the slowest song would not be soft enough to be a ballad. - Photos courtesy of EMI Music 
With 2004’s The Chronicles of Life and Death and 2007’s Good Morning Revival, the band members evolved their sound to include more dance and pop elements, alienating a hefty portion of their original fan base while gaining a whole slew of new fans in the process.
Now, Joel Madden (vocals), Benji Madden (guitar/background vocals), Paul Thomas (bass), Billy Martin (guitar/keyboard) and Dean Butterworth (drums) seem to have come full circle as they release Cardiology, an enjoyable combination of the best elements from all four of their previous records.
“Introduction to Cardiology” opens with soft vocal harmonies as Madden sings that cardiology is guiding you and me / through ancient history before the pop-punk guitars of the first full song, “Let the Music Play,” blare through the speakers.
Laden with a synth/keyboard backing, the song channels elements of early and new Good Charlotte and features pounding drums in the verses and a soaring chorus.
“Counting the Days” is one of the album’s best tracks and is so energetic that perhaps it should have swapped spots with “Let the Music Play” to start the record properly. This catchy number is sure to get fists flying in the air, especially when the rousing gang vocals add to the already high-octane beat.
Up next is “Silver Screen Romance,” which also keeps the energy up as a grooving bass line complements the fast guitars that lead into a sing-along chorus. The vocal arrangements are well done as are the lyrics with lines such as Oh, the nights were cold / without you hanging on my arm / it’s so good to be home.
The album’s first single, “Like It’s Her Birthday,” an upbeat song about a girlfriend that cannot be trusted, sounds like it could fit right in on Good Morning Revival and seems designed purely to get hands waving in the air. An excellent guitar solo in the bridge also adds a nice touch.
“Last Night” is another gem on the record, opening with a riff sure to grab anyone’s attention, and has perhaps the most anthemic chorus ever written by Good Charlotte.
Throughout this tale of debauchery, Madden sings lines that include All that I remember / is that you had me at hello / I knew right when I met her / that I wouldn’t take it slow.
Keeping the party atmosphere alive is “Sex on the Radio,” another catchy offering sure to find much success on the radio with high quality vocals provided by Madden and accentuated throughout by precise hand claps.
“Alive” is a hard-hitting love song while “Standing Ovation” channels Americana-style vibes with its opening riff. The latter is an inspirational offering about seizing the day and has a slower tempo to it than the previous tracks.
The slowest song, however, is “Harlow’s Song (Can’t Dream Without You),” an emotionally touching song about a father’s love for his daughter. It is not exactly a ballad, however, because of the strong build up just before the second verse.
“Interlude: The Fifth Chamber” is successful on its own, with a beautiful symphonic arrangement, but it does not lead seamlessly into the next track, “1979,” as it should.
“1979” is an upbeat, acoustic guitar-driven track about reminiscing about the good times, as Madden sings No time can take away these memories / remember when you said to me / that we’d be all right.
“There She Goes” features more impressive vocals from Madden and a masterfully constructed bridge to make the song memorable.
“Right Where I Belong” is home to an intriguing orchestral opening before the rest of the instrumentals kick in. The song is all about redemption, with lyrics that include I don’t know where to begin / to say I’m sorry for my sins, and its chorus will undoubtedly get hands waving in the air.
Closing the record is the title track, “Cardiology,” which is an extended version of the 47-second introductory track, further reinforces the idea that Good Charlotte has come full circle with this record.
If there is any one album that can define Good Charlotte up to this point, it is Cardiology. It touches on all of the elements of its past repertoire while adding an increased eye for detail and finesse.
There are fun party songs but also mature tracks about love and spiritual struggle, meaning that the record captures almost every feeling across the emotional spectrum.
What this release will do for Good Charlotte’s fan base remains to be seen, but it’s hard to imagine that anyone from either of the two factions could listen to Cardiology without having a smile come across their face.
The reviewer is correct: Cardiology does show Good Charlotte has come full circle and in a very good way.  The album is truly the best one they have ever released.  If you are an old school fan, you’ll see songs that could easily have fit in with their debut titled album as well as Y & H.  On the other hand, if you liked the later offerings, you will find that too.  However, the best part of this album is simply that the boys finally made it back to the point so many artists never make it back to in their musical journey.  They remembered why they made music in the first place and just had fun.  Kudos to the writer and the paper for still upholding the ‘standard’ of enjoying life.
I remember when I was a freshman at USC in 2002, excited about the new GC album (The Young and the Hopeless) coming out on my birthday, Oct 1, as I had been a big fan of the self-titled. I stopped listening to GC after that album though. I agree with the reviewer that the first two albums garnered support, at least initially. I think it was after the second album that they started to become a “bad joke,” as Brian suggests. I didn’t realize they were still making new music, so thank you to the reviewer doing this review. I might check out the album to see if there really are elements present from their early albums, as the reviewer claims. I’m not holding my breath though. 
It’s also weird to think that the many of USC students reading this article were barely in middle school when I was a USC freshman in 2002 when The Young and the Hopeless was released. So I’m sure their perspective of GC during that time period as a middle school student is much different than mine as a college student.
“Good Charlotte has seen much success over the years, beginning with its first two records that garnered much support from both the pop and punk communities.” Are you kidding? Good Charlotte is mostly seen as a bad joke these days. Surely there must have been some other band or album worthy of a review than these guys. 
I don’t mean to come down on the writer, but more the paper itself for lowering standards.

Sandro Corsaro, a USC alumnus, spent more than four years developing the short film that would land him the showrunner position on his original animated series, the Emmy-nominated Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil.
Talk to him today, and he’ll tell you that he never regretted a single moment of those years.
Prior to graduating from USC, where he majored in fine arts and animation, Corsaro started his professional career through a yearlong internship on the hand-drawn/CGI-hybrid film The Iron Giant.
Although he would become a member of the Disney team in 2006, Corsaro started out in creative development for Warner Bros. Animation, MTV Networks and Crest Digital.
Before giving his pitch for Kick Buttowski, Corsaro served as creative director for Disney Online, where he oversaw initiatives across the company’s flagship website.
Assorted campaigns included bolstering Disney’s online franchise, revamping the site and developing content. Corsaro would also publish two books — The Flash Animator and Hollywood 2D Digital Animation: The New Flash Production Revolution — to further promote his distinct animated style and overriding dream.
Today, Corsaro is the executive producer of his own show, one he worked hard to get green lighted Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil is the No. 1 series in total viewers for Disney XD. The show exhibits the signature style of flash animation, complemented by a suitable dose of 3-D environments.
For Corsaro, the development and subsequent success of his deft and zippy animated romp is nothing short of life-affirming.
“For as long as I can remember, I have always loved to draw. I was constantly coming up with new characters and inventing stories around them,” Corsaro said. “Taking what started out as a singular playful sketch to a massively collaborative TV show for Disney has certainly represented an element of that childhood fulfillment.”
But let us not forget what it took to get to that fulfillment. Kick Buttowski represents the culmination of many years of tireless work, not overnight success.
In the film industry, one must be prepared to toil and struggle before their ultimate goals materialize. More often, it is not that they face career cataclysm or intolerable diversity, but simply a limbo period between a “9-to-5” entry-level position and a coveted creative role.
“When starting out, you have to be willing to do jobs that might be below your immediate goals,” Corsaro said. “As your career evolves, you can begin building credibility through measured conviction.”
Despite the potential monotony of the first post-college job, it is essential that those in the entertainment world show some foresight and begin to see the value of current circumstances in regard to long-term aspirations. Too often, filmmakers forget how some of the greatest men have had some of the humblest beginnings and how it is counterproductive to compare the prolific careers of young millionaires to their own.
When filmmakers start to compare themselves to rapidly successful strangers, it unfairly diminishes their respectively significant accomplishments, especially when they take place over a long period of time. In definition, a career is based on the idea of longevity.
Filmmakers are propelled from one place to the next by a series of unpredictable occurrences and must simply be prepared when that golden opportunity arrives. Of course, at times, it’s almost impossible to know which one of many short films, drawings or industry contacts is going to ignite that long-term career, but in that uncertainty should be love for the process.
“When you have a creative idea, there is no mathematic formula or business plan to objectively distinguish success from failure,” Corsaro said. “On the onset, all you have is your instinct and confidence.”
For Corsaro, the four and a half years that he spent developing the short film that inspired Kick Buttowski was born out of a desire to perfect his craft and make sure it was done right. It did not represent “lost years.” In a practical sense, Corsaro was not working exclusively on the short but maintained steady income elsewhere — he was not a starving artist wasting away on a dream. And in a more metaphorical sense, those years each represented a separate but equally telling exploration into a creative soul.
“Certainly those moments can be incredibly lonesome, as you don’t have a team of trusted people to bounce ideas off of — so you go with what you and you alone think is best for that story or design,” Corsaro said. “[But] as challenging as that time was for me on a number of levels, it turned out to be one of the most treasured experiences of my creative career.”
After years of working on the project, Corsaro was able to see it come to fruition, and it was worth every year.
You have to love the journey.

Each week, five shadow figures appear on the Daily Brink’s home page. Each, one of the shadows drops to reveal a portrait. Clicking on the picture will take you to a profile, featuring an interview and a gallery of portraits of the subject.
The interviews themselves are very informal — jokes and humor are littered throughout the questions about the subject’s inspiration and passion. Each interview always ends with the question, “How can Daily Brink help?”
The individuals interviewed hail from a variety of fields and backgrounds — musicians, models, bloggers, activists, a jam anarchist and even a 10-year-old technology genius.
The founders of The Daily Brink come from our very own Trojan Family: Gary Goldman, a senior majoring in international relations (global business) and Jeremy Allen, who graduated from USC in May with a degree in studio arts.
The duo initially had an uncertain start.
“This had never been done before, so we kept thinking something would go wrong, that somehow it wouldn’t work out,” Goldman said.
Despite their doubt, the two extended the Trojan connection further with the addition of webmaster Ryo Chiba and head photographer Zack DeZon, both USC alumni.
The idea for the website came to Allen after interning at Interview Magazine, which contains a section that features interviews with someone on the cusp of something new and exciting in a variety of fields.
“I felt it was the most interesting part, and I wanted to devote an entire publication to just that,” Allen said.
The pair began to find potential interview subjects by talking to their friends.
“I have this theory that everybody knows at least three people who are doing something fascinating, especially people from USC,” Allen said. “Every school at USC is the best at what it does, so whenever we seek out someone special, we know they’ll be there in any profession.”
This led to the discovery of the site’s very first “brinker,” Patricia Manuel. Manuel is the 2009 national U.S. boxing champion and is training to be the first female boxer to represent the United States at the 2012 Olympics.
“You would think that she had a lot of press around that, but no, she’s an African American butch lesbian, and the press doesn’t want to talk about that,” Goldman said. The day after the interview was published on the Daily Brink, Manuel was featured AfterEllen.com.
In addition to interviews, visitors to The Daily Brink can also utilize a social networking component to connect to these “brinkers,” with each interview page featuring a comment box that contains the subject’s e-mail address.
Clicking on the connect box will allow viewers to see what the subject is looking for — be it donations to pet organizations, volunteers, representation, or just promotion of products and activities.
“You read about someone, you get a chance to connect with them and then you can help them,” Goldman said. “It’s a full circle.”
Since the website’s launch on Sept. 6, the Daily Brink has received about 16,500 views. Despite being in its nascent stage, Allen and Goldman have several plans for the young project, including an iPad application, blogs, podcasts and even expanding to cover “brinkers” across the world.
“The site is based on the foundation of forward thinking,” Goldman said. “We never want to be complacent — we always want to be one step ahead.”

Recently compiled police data showed that gang-related crime has dropped 40 percent over the last three years in inner-city neighborhoods that have Summer Night Lights recreational centers, a program intended to curb violence through mentoring, counseling, and leisure activities.
Summer Night Lights was launched in the summer of 2008 and has now expanded to 24 sites in the Los Angeles area. The hours of operation were extended to midnight four days a week to provide a safe place for residents to go to during the time of night when violent crimes are most likely to occur.
The data showed that residents of neighborhoods with a Summer Night Lights center made 710,000 visits between July 7 and Sept. 4 in the summer of 2010. The program also provides free meals; on average, 10,929 people received a free dinner each night that Summer Night Lights was in operation throughout the city this past summer.
“You are there to feed these neighborhoods, literally and symbolically,” Deputy Mayor Guillermo Cespedes told the Los Angeles Times. “This isn’t a soup kitchen. This is literally nourishing the neighborhood,” he said.
well done this is amusing

With elections tomorrow, people might be curious as to which of their friends are going to vote and which are not.  Thanks to a Facebook application created last week, users of the social networking site can now figure this out with just a few clicks of the mouse.
On Oct. 25, the California Democratic Party released the “Friend Out the Vote” application, which searches a user’s list of Facebook friends — with his permission — and identifies which ones are registered as Democrats but don’t vote regularly. It does this by matching friends’ names to their party registrations and voting histories, using the same strategy political parties use when it targets voters through direct mail.
“It’s no creepier than getting a piece of mail saying vote for candidate X or candidate Y,” Tenoch Flores, a spokesperson for the Democratic party, told the Los Angeles Times.
Once the list is generated, the application encourages the person using it to urge their friends to vote on Nov. 2.  The friends that come up on the list of non-voters do not have to give their consent prior to being listed.
The CDP says the application could be an extremely useful tool in getting the 15.4 million voting-age Facebook users in California to cast their ballots in tomorrow’s election.

Soul duo Nikki & Rich have been testing the boundaries of the music world with their raw, innovative combo.  Haven’t heard of them?  Well, you will soon.
The combo is comprised of Nikki Leonti, the beautiful voice behind the soul powerhouse, and Rich Skillz, a former DJ turned producer.  The two recently collaborated to produce a funky, retro-soul sound that is nostalgic for old Motown, but still manages to stay fresh.
With a song airing on the HBO hit-series Entourage, and appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Ellen, Nikki & Rich have been continuing to attract new fans.
Thus far, the dynamic duo have released their EP Next Best Thing, which serves as a preview of what the couple is capable of and what listeners can look forward to when their album, Everything, drops early next year.

A male student fell from the sixth floor of Birnkrant Residence Hall this morning, according to Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
According to an e-mail sent to Birnkrant residents, the student was identified as Jackson Roddy, a freshman majoring in accounting. Roddy is pledging Sigma Nu fraternity.
Los Angeles City Fire Department paramedics and the Los Angeles City Police Department responded to the scene at about 6 a.m. and treated Roddy. A DPS report listed the incident as happening between 6:02 and 6:30 a.m.
Though his condition is not known, Roddy was transferred to the California Hospital.
The university released a statement on USC’s website shortly before noon.
“Our thoughts and prayers go to the student and his family,” said Dr. Michael L. Jackson, vice president for Student Affairs.
The statement also encouraged all students to seek counseling if needed, and said the university was reaching out to those who might have been affected by the incident. Students can contact Student Affairs at (213) 740-2421 or the USC Center for Work and Family Life at (213) 821-0800. Four counselors have been designated specifically to the dorm, the statement said.
Though official DPS reports in the morning indicated that incident might have been caused by a jump, authorities said they now do not know the cause of the fall and are still investigating.
“I don’t even know how to characterize what happened except that we know that someone on the sixth floor ended up on the ground. How that happened is being investigated by everyone,” said James Grant, director of USC Media Relations.
