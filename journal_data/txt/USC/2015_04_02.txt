As the weather heats up, athletes and couch potatoes alike are facing a common fear: sweaty socks.
Two members of the Trojan family are working to curb this inconvenience by creating a line of odor-repelling socks.
Dubbed the SilverAir Sock, the foot accessories were developed by USC alumnus Sam Mazumdar, a 2011 Marshall graduate, and current USC undergraduate student, Waiz Rahim, a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering.
The socks are made from silver and Merino wool. Mazumdar and Rahim selected wool as the primary material because it has odor-resistant qualities and can sustain long periods of activity.
“We tried and tested a ton of materials and selected the finest Merino wool for its ability to wick moisture and regulate temperature,” Mazumdar said. “It’s a custom blend that’s unique to our product and is guaranteed to keep your feet super comfortable and happy.”
The company was funded through the crowdsourcing website Kickstarter. Within three hours of launching their odor-repelling socks, Mazumdar and Rahim received more than half of their target Kickstarter goal of $35,000 to launch the SilverAir Sock. They currently have raised nearly $70,000.
The sock is being introduced through their company Y Athletics. the idea for the company came from an idea Mazumdar had to create an athletic apparel brand that used the best products in every category. With that concept, Rahim used his marketing knowledge to spread the word about the company.
In addition to the SilverAir Sock, Y Athletics also sells its odor-repelling SilverAir shirt, which was launched in 2013. The company’s SilverAir shirts have been sold on its website and used by thousands of customers in all 50 states and more than 70 different countries. Through the popularity of their shirts, Mazumdar and Rahim were inspired to create the sock version of the product line.
“We love and wear our shirts every day, and they’re so popular that we have a difficult time keeping up with their demand,” Mazumdar said. “It just made sense to be able to offer the same performance in another piece of clothing that would benefit from the convenience.”
Now, they hope to let investors know that the socks are designed to be versatile and perfect for any situation, whether it be exercising or going out.
In terms of development, Mazumdar and Rahim have been working with their sock manufacturer for almost a year to test dozens of prototypes and designs before they came up with their final product to demonstrate to potential backers. Different athletic backers heavily tested their socks over a series of nine months in order for Mazumdar and Rahim to engineer a better odor-eliminating product.
“Our goal is to get as many people as we can get to experience this product because you don’t realize how amazing it is until you’ve used it. It makes living easier,” Mazumdar said.
Despite exceeding their financial goal, Mazumdar and Rahim are still accepting backers for their SilverAir Sock campaign on Kickstarter until May 2015. The company expects to start sourcing and producing the socks in June and shipping them to potential customers by August 2015.
Congratulations Waiz for being featured in Daily Trojan.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted an event called The Power, Danger and Responsibility of Voice on Thursday evening in Doheney Memorial Library. The goal of the event was to stimulate discussion among students and political experts about gender equality in Muslim households and how to make progress in these areas through sparking discussion about the issue.
The event began with a screening of the movie Breaking the Silence: Moroccans Speak Out! The film, produced by GlobalGirl Media, focuses on issues of sexual harassment in Morocco. Before the film was screened, a panel consisting of Williams; Heidi Basch-Harod, executive director of Women’s Voices Now, and Ariana Seymore, a freshman majoring in policy, planning and development, provided information about GlobalGirl Media and why these individuals wanted to get involved.
Williams discussed the origination of GlobalGirl Media and why she focused on garnering participation from girls of the global south.
“GlobalGirl Media was the brainchild of not just myself but a number of women,” Williams said. “I said, ‘I want to get more girls behind the camera, particularly girls from the global south. My partner wanted stories that were authentic and reported from the perspective of women through a gender lens.”
Seymore got involved with GlobalGirl Media in order to raise awareness for human trafficking in America.
She explained that many are uninformed or misinformed about sex trafficking in California.
“And the trouble that that girl’s friend was facing really concerned me and when I talked to other people about it they didn’t know that we had a sex trafficking problem in California or in the suburbs, and I thought that would be a great piece to report about because not only did not a lot of people know about sex trafficking in California but there are a lot of misconceptions out there,” she said.
Following the film was a panel featuring Zaid Abu Hamdan, writer and director for Bahiya & Mahmoud; Roopashree Jeevaji, actor in Words with Gods; Sherman Jackson, King Faisal Chair in Islamic Thought and Culture; Muslema Purmul, co-founder and scholar-in-residence at Safa Center for Research and Education.
The panel was moderated by Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute and Rebecca Siegel, lifestyle assignments editor at the Daily Trojan,
Jeevaji discussed that in order to move along to the next step to help women combat sexual harassment, it is important that more people become involved in the conversation.
“I think to have a dialogue is very important but I think the next step for women is to involve boys and men and encourage them to advocate for that change,” Jeevaji said. “To make them aware, to create a dialogue that they can be a part of, and create that awareness I think would be the next step.”
Hamdan, who originally grew up in Jordan, also noted how important it is to build a strong foundation of respect in order to combat the larger gender issues that pervade the Middle East.
“I really think this is even bigger than father-son relationships,” Hamdan said. “I think there is an undertone of women feeling inferior in the Middle East and being okay with it and that really bothers me.”
Purmul, who was raised in America but went to school in the Middle East, agreed but added that her experiences differed based on the socioeconomic status of her environment.
“I noticed for myself that when I was in public areas that anyone had access to, in particular a lower socioeconomic background, it’s not because they’re poor necessarily but because they do not have access to a solid education,” she said.
Purmul also noted how people with a more scholarly background in their faith tended to be more respectful in her experience, using a quote by the prophet Muhammed to illustrate this point.
“Only a noble man treats women in an honorable manner, and only an ignoble man of low character treats women disgracefully,” Purmul said.
I must agree with Don.  This sounds like another uninspired waste of time and effort.  Nothing new learned here folks.  This is everyday life in the Muslim world, and whether or not it is even our business to challenge it is up for debate.   But here’s the hypocrisy I see:  Many of the same people in our society who are wholly against our insertion into foreign lives and affairs (famously President Bush and Iraq, but there are several other examples) have absolutely no problem injecting themselves into the domestic and religious behaviours of Mulsims as discussed by this panel.  This is what Muslims believe and how they live.
And a final note for everyone that will change your life:  STOP CHASING EQUALITY.  It’s the wrong goal.  Chase FAIRNESS instead.  Equality rarely exists in life or in nature, but fairness is a virtuous goal we should all seek to achieve.  Sometimes what’s fair and right is not “equal”.  This is life-changing folks!  It will change the entire ridiculous narrative of our time.
I don’t get it. The panel assembled and concluded that Morocco, like every other Muslim country, treats its women like miserable slaves. So what was accomplished? Anyone who watches TV or reads already knows this. And the domestic habits of Muslims in their  own countries are beyond our ability to change. A waste of time and this article is a waste of space. Sorry, but there it is.

The Marshall School of Business will begin offering an online Master of Business Administration program focused on emerging technological business topics in the fall of 2015. The program will concentrate on Internet analytics, social media, virtual teams and entrepreneurial thinking.
Though the program focuses on the online workspace, the curriculum will encompass all core areas of business such as analytics and communications.
Marshall faculty will manage the online MBA program. Students will engage in the program by watching weekly seminars from professors recorded via webcam and will attend one weeklong, on-campus event. The flexible layout allows students with busy schedules to still have real-time interactions with teachers and view educational content that’s available at any time.
Marshall Dean James G. Ellis said that the program will be offered to students worldwide.
“The new online MBA [program] will allow students from around the world, regardless of time zone and location, the opportunity to join the Marshall Trojan Family and benefit from a world-class MBA degree,” Ellis said in a statement to USC Marshall News.
The content presented in the program was all made specifically for the class, as opposed to other online courses, which take in-class content and upload it online.
During class, students will work on interactive exercises and will sometimes meet in virtual group settings. Students will have the option to also take online courses from other USC schools, as well as Marshall Master of Science programs in entrepreneurship, marketing and global supply chain management.
John Matsusaka, USC Marshall Online MBA academic director, noted that the program will allow Marshall faculty to teach using new online resources.
“Online technologies continue to rapidly reshape our world,” Matsusaka told Marshall News. “As an innovator in higher education, our new program pushes the Marshall MBA into the online world, allowing us to deploy new learning technologies and to reach students across the globe.”
To help support the program’s launch and growth, Marshall has partnered with All Campus, a creative agency and enrollment services firm.
Joe Diamond, CEO of All Campus, said his company is happy to partner with Marshall and change the online classroom experience for the better.
“Our team looks forward to partnering with such an esteemed university on a program that’s built to raise expectations and change the way we all think about the online MBA,” Diamond told Marshall News.
Marshall has already developed other online programs like the Master of Business Taxation and Master of Global Supply Chain Management. The business school has trained faculty, organized an instructional team and created a studio to expand the online MBA program curriculum.

Due to the lengthy processes involved in acquiring performer contracts for Springfest, an annual on-campus music event, the USC Concerts Committee has been unable to release the names of the 2015 headliners in advance of the event on Saturday, April 4.
Caitlin Harriford, executive board member of the Concerts Committee, told the Daily Trojan that there have been issues surrounding the release of the lineup of artists for Saturday’s concert.
“The issue is that we can’t say anything until contracts are executed,” Harriford said. “Right now, they are sitting with a USC legal team.”
Harriford also said the process of confirming artists and announcing their performances involves  communication with the university’s legal counsel.
“They don’t really tell us when they’re going to sign [the contracts],” Harriford said. “It’s unfortunate that they’re not that transparent with us, but part of it is that they have to get all their terms straight.”
At the time of publication, confirmed Springfest 2015 headliners include Walla, Portugal. The Man and BØRNS.
Prior to Springfest performances, the Black Student Assembly is hosting Gearfest 2015 as a part of the Springfest activities on Saturday, at 3 p.m.
According to the Assembly’s Facebook page, the event “brings to life the fusion of music, fashion and technology across an eclectic mix of mediums.”
Artists confirmed to perform at Gearfest include Audio Push and Isaiah Rashad.
In anticipation of Saturday, Harriford spoke about Concerts Committee’s main goal which was to maximize student enjoyment.
“We’re just focused on putting on a really great show, and we hope people come out and have a great time,” Harriford said.

Doctors are supposed to provide answers when you’re sick or injured. Yet research has found that many patients in fact do not understand their conditions and as a result, patients need to take a more proactive role in their own treatment to improve their health literacy.
In the past year, 82.1 percent of adults in the U.S. saw a health care professional. Because healthcare is in such high demand, doctors can only afford to spend 15 to 20 minutes of their time with each patient. An extra hour they spend with you, explaining everything you possibly need to know about your health, is another two to three patients that they can’t now see.
That was my experience at least. When I went to a doctor for tingling in my hands and pain in my elbow, I was told that I had mild carpal tunnel syndrome and sent home with a week’s worth of anti-inflammatories. The office was busy that day and the receptionists were ushering people in and out as fast as possible. I left the doctor’s office without knowing what carpal tunnel syndrome was, what caused it or how to guard against it. Even with the drugs, my symptoms got worse not better and if you consider my health literacy, that’s not very surprising.
When resources are limited, you only get the time that others allocate for you so it’s essential to make use of the time you do have. Ask the questions that need to be asked or clarify again just to make sure you understand. You might feel embarrassed for not understanding what the doctor said the first time, but you’ll feel twice as foolish for leaving without ever knowing what he meant. If you don’t know understand your condition, how can you take care of yourself?
Most health problems serious enough to visit a doctor for don’t go away if you don’t deal with them. Online medical databases can be a resource to bridge the knowledge gap, but they aren’t perfect substitute for doctors who can evaluate medical histories and symptoms face-to-face. Why pick the substitute when you’ve just paid a doctor to advise you in the first place. Take the initiative to become informed and do it right the first time. You’ll save yourself a whole lot more time, money and stress in the long-term.

Before a packed Ground Zero audience last night, four Asian diasporic artists spoke of identity, displacement, and finally, finding solace in creativity. The Visions & Voices event, which featured performances from Sam Chanse, D’Lo, Nicolas Wong and Chiwan Choi, tackled weighty topics from sexuality to immigrant identity, through mediums that we often don’t see from Asian Americans in the U.S. This group of performing artists hailed from backgrounds that were just as diverse as the narratives they shared, with roots in Hong Kong, New York and Sri Lanka — just to name a few.
Though each artist grew up under different circumstances, what they all shared in common was the sense that they had lived their lives under multiple identities, hence the event’s namesake, Self/Split. Though all four artists can be considered to be of the Asian diaspora, Sam Chanse mentioned that the Asian American issues — especially pertaining to the topic of identity — didn’t just apply to Asian Americans, but to everyone.
“Asian American issues are universal. You don’t have to be Asian American to understand oppression, to be in the margin, or smell your mother’s cooking — everyone can smell,” she said with a wry finish.
D’Lo’s story was more personal, focused on experiences regarding being transgender and coming out. Chiwan Choi performed a somber poem that explored his experience of being “abducted” from his native Korea, to adjust to a new life in South America, a move that was his parents’ choice, not his. He spoke of memory and how language and other details have since become blurred in his mind. He realizes that his past is simply something artificial that is constructed out of the present visual cues, and that nothing he remembers can truly be verified. Choi believes that with each shift in his life, a part of his identity had been lost. He spoke of the relatable idea of wanting to go back in time, to see who he was before fragments of his identity split and were lost forever, but also acknowledging that it was poetry that could help him go forward to find what had been lost in the past.
Nicolas Wong also told a personal narrative, a story involving his dad’s illness to the trend in Mainland China to be giving birth in Hong Kong, where he is from originally. He spoke of how local Hong Kong women felt that their healthcare resources were being exploited. Sam Chanse shared a fictional narrative sprinkled with humor, where she portrayed multiple characters until finally exploring the details of her own identity. She too spoke of her path into the arts, and how it played a role into solidifying her identity until the point of today.
In a country with a fairly large Asian demographic, I still find it strange that Asian Americans are still underrepresented in the arts and literary communities. The experience last night felt like a rare one, when it shouldn’t have been. One of the largest takeaways from the evening was how varied each artist’s story was, both in structure and experience. It went to show that there is no single Asian American experience, no box that Asian poetry or Asian art could fit squarely into.

For a second-straight week, the USC sand volleyball team sits atop the AVCA national rankings. The team added  two more wins to their record on Thursday, defeating Loyola Marymount and Concordia in a doubleheader at Merle Norman Stafium.
The Women of Troy look to ride that momentum into the month of April against a familiar foe in No. 3-ranked Pepperdine.
Putting their undefeated record on the line, the No. 1-ranked Women of Troy (14-0) face a tough test on Saturday when they travel to Zuma Beach to take on the Waves in a clash between two of the best teams in the nation.
Off to their best start in program history, the Women of Troy are hoping to maintain their unblemished record with a good showing against the rival Waves. The two teams are certainly no strangers to one another, either, as the weekend matchup will be the schools’ 10th meeting all-time. Pepperdine holds the 7-2 advantage in those matches, but the streaking Women of Troy are looking to add a win to their own column and change the tide.
According to head coach Anna Collier, the team is looking to spoil the Waves’ perfect record at home as well.
“We’re really good at home here at Merle Norman because it’s our stadium and we’re used to it, so it’ll be tough to play at Pepperdine. In fact, I don’t think anyone has ever beaten Pepperdine at Pepperdine because it’s at a windy beach,” said Collier. “We got some practice time at the beach this week and trained for what we’re going to do when we do face them, and I think that’s going to give us a little more of an opportunity to beat them on their home court.”
Pepperdine, the defending national champion and losers of only five total dual matches in four years, are looking to avenge their loss to USC less than two weeks ago. Back on March 24, the Women of Troy handed Pepperdine a 3-2 loss at Merle Norman Stadium, and in that match, all three of USC’s lower flights produced points that would end up securing the victory.
The sophomore tandem of Allie Wheeler and Nicolette Martin scored USC’s first point at court four, while the senior-freshman pairing of Bria Russ and Jenna Belton at the five spot added a second point to the team total. USC’s top two flights of sophomores Sara Hughes and Kelly Claes and Sophie Bukovec and Alexa Strange both went down to the Waves in close sets, leaving it all up to the seniors at court three to pull out a victory. The No. 3 pair of Eve Ettinger and Meg Norton eventually pulled off a thrilling three-set victory over Pepperdine’s Emily Cook and Delaney Knudsen to seal the 3-2 dual victory for the Women of Troy.
With that win two weeks ago, USC has become the proverbial “giant-slayers” of the powerhouse Pepperdine program as of late. Only four teams have been able to beat the Waves, with USC being the only team to defeat Pepperdine more than once. After going undefeated in 2012, the two-time national champion Waves lost just one dual in 2013.
The Waves have been in a bit of a slump after losing two of their last three duals, the first being the 3-2 loss to USC and the other being a 3-2 loss to Florida International last week. With a loss against Hawai’i earlier in the season, three losses on the record for Pepperdine is uncommon, and the Waves are looking to get back to their winning ways with this match against USC.
Moreover, the Women of Troy have contributed to two of Pepperdine’s five total losses in program history, and with a win on Saturday, USC hopes to maintain a high level of play as it heads into the end of the regular season.
After playing six dual matches in a five-day span last week and playing two more duals on Thursday, the Women of Troy have finally gotten through the bulkiest part of their schedule. According to Collier, trips to Hawaii and Arizona, coupled with the five other matches held at Merle Norman Stadium, have been a great way to test the team.
“We’ve played a lot of duals last week and this week we’ve been resting because the girls were exhausted,” Collier said. “But we’ve had Monday and Wednesday off and worked on the technical things, which is what we need to do when we face Pepperdine.”
After its match against the Waves, USC will have just four more dual matches this season before they head to the AVCA Championships in Gulf Shores, Alabama, in early May. Though the ultimate goal is to win a national championship, Collier wants her team to remain focused.
“I’d almost rather not be 14-0 because it is so difficult to sustain that kind of winning, but we’re just going to keep working on the little things and improving with each match, so we want to take another step and work harder,” Collier said. “It’s a new challenge for the athletes, and it refreshes them so we can maintain that winning streak. Perhaps that’s how we can keep this streak going.”
The dual match between the Women of Troy and Pepperdine on Saturday will tip off at 10 a.m. at Zuma Beach.

With the spring game on the horizon, the USC football team is making the most of the final few days of spring practice.
This week’s practices were held at the Coliseum, which looked even more gargantuan in its emptiness. There has been a slightly different feel to practice of late, mainly because the players will actually be suiting up and hitting one another in real game action on April 11 for the spring game.
Head coach Steve Sarkisian has been keen on giving the team a variety of game-like scenarios during spring ball. At Thursday’s practice in the 11-on-11 drills, quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Max Browne were asked to start from the shadow of their own goalposts. 
On the first two drives, the offense managed to pick up a handful of first downs. The next two drives, however, saw the defense force a safety and a pick-six on back-to-back plays. The defense was fired up and rightly so, though they were unable to lay the lumber because the players were only wearing half-pads. Tuesday featured no pads, while the shoulder pads came out on Thursday. On Saturday, the team will be donning full pads, which will be a nice sneak preview of the spring game.
Though spring practice is essentially the prologue of the season, some storylines and takeaways have really stood out so far. The defense is firing on all cylinders, as several players have left positive impressions on coaches and teammates alike.
Soon-to-be junior safety Su’a Cravens is just scratching the surface ability-wise. Defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox, defensive backs coach Keith Heyward and linebackers coach Peter Sirmon certainly realize that Cravens can go from exceptional to unstoppable. Cravens is one of the most dominant safeties in the country, and quite frankly, the stat sheet cannot do his game justice. Sure, in 2014 his ten total tackles against Cal turned heads, as did his 31-yard pick-six against Oregon State. But his consistency just might be his greatest quality of all.
“Instinctually he’s always had it,” Sirmon said. “From where he started the first two weeks last season in terms of just the fundamentals, he’s grown immensely, and I think you are going to see that reflected in consistent production the whole season.”
As the linebackers coach, and thus the coach of defensive quarterbacks, Sirmon emphasizes consistency. Dependability trumps flash, and that same premise holds true for Cravens’ game. That steady production at the safety position provides a major boost to the Trojans’ secondary, even in spring ball.
As for the fellow members of the defensive backfield, Adoree’ Jackson spent Thursday’s session with the offense. Jackson hauled in a number of passes, contorting his body every which way and reminding every pair of eyes watching him that he is just as dynamic on offense as he is on defense. It is somewhat baffling to see USC’s No. 2 playing the role of shutdown corner on Tuesday only to come back on Thursday and dominate at the wide receiver position.
“I think what we learned about Adoree’ a year ago is he has a really high football IQ,” Coach Sarkisian said. “We’re going to have to be very strategic when we go into games of exactly how we’re going to use him.”
Sarkisian lauded Jackson’s diverse skillset, saying the freshman phenom is capable of scoring whenever the ball is in his hands. “He is something else. His ability to learn, retain and ultimately apply what he does on the field day after day from one side of the ball to another is very impressive,” Sarkisian said. As a two-way player, Jackson is the definition of an ironman and is truly a rare breed in modern-day college football.
Meanwhile, during Thursday’s “finish challenge,” inside linebacker Lamar Dawson made the winning play, as he once again showcased his skills and continued his high level of play that coaches have seen from him all spring. Coach Sarkisian said, “He’s just been a really active player for us—a guy who continues to show up and do those things we think he’s capable of doing.”
Additionally, inside linebacker Olajuwon Tucker is stronger, knows the playbook better and is becoming more versatile. Tucker and Dawson both look primed for a strong 2015 campaign, which will be of the utmost importance to this defense because of the up-tempo spread offenses, as well as the pass-heavy offenses and pro style offenses, that the Trojans will face in Pac-12 play.
“In our conference, we get spread out so much, and our linebackers get put in a lot of one-on-one scenarios to shed blocks off of guards and then get off the blocks and make those plays and make those tackles,” Sarkisian said. Sarkisian stressed size and physicality from the linebacker position as a way to minimize big gainers by dynamic offenses’ dangerous playmakers.
It should also be noted that defensive tackle Cody Temple is getting important reps this spring. Coach Sarkisian praised Temple for his tenacity in practice, especially because he is going up against one of the best centers in the nation in Max Tuerk. 
“All in all, it was a really competitive practice,” Sarkisian said. “There were some really cool teachable moments for us about playing and becoming a more disciplined football team, which is what we’re striving to become.”

The No. 8-ranked Trojans dropped three straight sets (20-25, 14-25, 20-25)  on its way to a road defeat at the hands  of No. 3- ranked Pepperdine on Thuesday night.
USC Trojans  (14-8, 12-7 MPSF) will not have much time to recover, as the team now heads up north to take on No. 14 Stanford (9-13, 6-10 MPSF).
Even though the team lost against Pepperdine, the Trojans now have the opportunity ro redeem themselves against the Cardinal, in hopes of  regaining a boost of momentum heading down the final stretch of the regular season.
In their last homestand, the Trojans outlasted both No. 7 UCSB and No. 12 UCLA in five-set matches. The matches were filled with high, down-to-the-wire intensity; some could even say heart-attack inducing intensity.
“The biotech companies are lining up to sponsor us for heart medication,” head coach Bill Ferguson joked.
According to junior libero and captain Brooks Varni, the team’s recent success has once again created a lively atmosphere.
“We’re having fun,” Varni s. “That’s the most important thing that kind of gets lost in all this.”
“Fun” has definitely helped the team get back into its early-season groove. For players like Varni, having fun keeps the focus on the court, and the team’s play has improved because of it.
“The reemergence of Brooks Varni — my gosh,” Ferguson said. “He’s come back and he’s doing it with confidence.”
Back in January, the Trojans handled the Stanford Cardinal in three-straight sets (25-16, 27-25, 25-19). Other than briefly during the second set, Stanford didn’t prove to be much of a challenge for USC.
The last time the Trojans faced the Cardinal, senior middle blocker Robert Feathers had a season-high .750 hitting percentage. With nine kills, Feathers tied a team-high along with freshman outside hitter Larry Tuileta, redshirt sophomore outside hitter Christopher Orenic and junior opposite Josh Kirchner.
When it comes to the Trojans’ offense, run by senior setter Micah Christenson, there have been fantastic performances from countless players.
Tuileta has been solid and dependable in the team’s recent matches, tallying up a combined 26 kills in the last two matches.
“He’s the stable guy on the outside hitting core,” Ferguson said.
Most recently, the Trojans have amped up their attack in the middle. Ferguson has been rotating between sophomore Andy Benesh, junior Tommy Leonard and Feathers. The rotation of the three — between their hitting, serving and blocking — has created a nearly unstoppable force at the net for USC.
“The three middles are all playing at a really high level,” Ferguson said.
“It gives us an option to change things up if we need to.”
The Trojans’ upcoming match against Stanford is one of their last three conference games. While the Trojans have already clinched a playoff spot, continuing to win would allow them to move up in the rankings and earn a better draw in tournament play.
The Trojans will head up to Palo Alto to take on the Cardinal this Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
 
That statement by Varni of having fun is a disservice to the fans and supporters of this team. Getting swept so easily
shows absolutely no momentum being gained from the last two wins which were over mediocre teams. There is too
much indecisiveness on the part of the coaching staff with playing time for a few of the players game after game. Some
thing wrong if the Trojans can’t beat Stanford and Cal Baptist (twice) to finish the regular season.

Half-nude dancers gyrate on the hood of a souped-up Dodge Challenger. Imports and muscle cars vie for dominance on the mean streets of Los Angeles and the sun-washed avenues of Abu Dhabi. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) practices his brooding in the rearview mirror while the hulking Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) flexes impatiently, fingering the biggest mini-gun this side of the first Predator movie. Yes, another installment of the Fast and Furious series is upon us.
The car-crazy franchise, which began with Rob Cohen’s The Fast and the Furious in 2001, is one of the strangest success stories in showbiz history, going from the cinematic equivalent of a sputtering clunker to a sleek luxury sedan — the last one grossed more than $700 million worldwide — thanks to a combination of constant, meticulous reinvention and sheer goofball audacity.
From the very beginning, though, the true appeal of these movies has been their steadfast, un-ironic commitment to providing big dumb fun in two-hour doses. That’s why their ever-expanding fan base turns out in droves for every new installment. In short, these are films made for action junkies who know the difference between regular cheese and premium cheddar, and that distinction has already netted more than $2 billion at the box office.
Every Fast and Furious film so far has possessed its own distinct feeling and flavor. The first movie, inspired by a Vibe magazine article about the perilous culture of street racing, introduced viewers to Los Angeles Police Department Officer Brian O’Connor (Paul Walker) as the undercover lawman infiltrated L.A.’s auto-fetishistic underworld, where he soon crossed paths with Dominic “Dom” Toretto, a champion street racer and part-time criminal with a multicultural crew of speed demons whose bonds go deeper than blood. Even though the film received mixed reviews, it grossed over $207 million on a relatively modest budget of $38 million by tapping into a lucrative niche audience of adolescent males and gear heads.
The sadly Diesel-less sequel, the ridiculously titled 2 Fast 2 Furious, moved the action to Florida and introduced Brian’s childhood friend Roman (Tyrese Gibson), an experienced wheelman whose quick wit and sharp reflexes prove instrumental in taking down Miami-based drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser). The film, directed by John Singleton, suffered from a rushed production schedule and a script so shoddy it drove away Diesel, making it the franchise’s most negligible episode. It also grossed significantly less than its predecessor, leading to the radical quasi-reboot that was The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, which adopted a new protagonist, Sean (Lucas Black), a reckless American teenager who becomes immersed in Japan’s drift racing scene after meeting Dom’s longtime friend and fellow racing enthusiast Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang).
Even though it appeared divorced from the official continuity save for a last-minute cameo from Diesel, Tokyo Drift actually paved the way for the franchise’s later critical and commercial resurgence by bringing on director Justin Lin, who would go on to helm the two most successful episodes of the series to date. It also serves as a lynchpin to the films’ slightly funky chronology, taking place shortly after the sixth installment, although this bold choice wouldn’t be made clear until nearly a decade later, during a jaw-dropping mid-credits stinger featuring the villainous Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham).
After stumbling with the overly somber fourth entry, unimaginatively titled Fast and Furious, which is notable mainly for reuniting Diesel and Walker, Lin roared back with what would become his magnum opus. If the rest of the series is premium cheddar, Fast Five is straight up pule (that’s the fanciest cheese in the world for those of you who aren’t hardcore turnophiles). This is the film that set aside the bluster of street racing and effectively switched genres, embracing the look and feel of a heist movie a la Oceans Eleven and The Italian Job. One sequence in particular involving a Dodge Charger dragging a massive bank vault through the streets of Rio rates an honorable mention in any discussion of the all-time great cinematic car chases.
Fast and Furious 6, also directed by Lin, continued the international intrigue angle, pitting Dom’s family of friends, now reluctant government agents, against a cadre of globetrotting mercenaries run by Deckard’s younger brother Owen (Luke Evans, best known as Bard the Bowman in the Hobbit trilogy). It wasn’t quite the breath of fresh air that Fast Five was, but it still had its moments, including a physics-defying highway chase involving a tank and an absurd final battle set on an airstrip that seemed to go on for dozens of miles.
So how will Furious 7, which is expected to enjoy a nine-figure opening weekend, stack up against its predecessors? The film boasts a new director, James Wan, whose previous credits include modestly budgeted horror hits Saw, The Conjuring and the first two Insidious films, as well as the underrated Kevin Bacon vigilante thriller Death Sentence. It will be interesting to see what the notoriously frugal filmmaker is able to accomplish with a blockbuster budget.
The true test of the movie’s quality, however, will be whether or not it serves as a worthy send-off to the late Paul Walker, whose untimely death in 2013 no doubt haunts every frame of the finished film. Early reviews have been largely positive so far — a rarity for this resolutely populist franchise — with a few notoriously stonehearted critics even confessing to shedding tears during the final shot, which is rumored to be a loving tribute to the actor, who had already filmed the bulk of his scenes prior to the car accident that claimed his life (Walker’s two brothers were later asked to serve as stand-ins and Peter Jackson’s effects company Weta Digital allegedly provided CG augmentation). Even if the film itself disappoints, its very existence sends a well-intentioned but slightly ghoulish message: Not even death can slow this franchise down.

Our Daily Trojan Photo Editor, Mariya Dondonyan, received the opportunity to be sponsored by Contiki this last spring break and join in on the company’s Sun and Steam tour to photograph the northern island of New Zealand. Our focus was on finding the importance of traveling while students are still in school and the benefits it could have on our lives.
New Zealand is an incredibly gorgeous, tropical country with the kindest locals and warmest culture. The vibe of this country is always in high spirits and full of adventure. While on Contiki, many ‘Me Time’ adventures were offered for the travelers on board including activities as relaxed as cave tours and aquarium trips to extremely adventurous ones like bungee jumping, white water rafting, and sky diving. In addition to ‘Me Time’ optionals, Contiki offers their own inclusions that give us the opportunity to learn more about that country’s culture and local environment outside of tourist-y attractions.
One of the towns we visited was Rotorua because of it’s important hub of Maori culture. We recognized and respected their culture and traditions today as we visited the Tama-te-kapua house which is a Maori meeting house. We took a stroll through Ohinemutu to the Te Papaiouru Marae, the town’s village center and listened to stories, songs and chants and learned about ancient Maori mythology and beliefs. There was a great sense of richness and depth of Maori culture in the air and it was refreshing and enlightening. After our culture learning, we enjoyed an amazing Maori hāngi dinner and traditional dance concert. Some of the foods we tried from the hāngi were sweet potato and chicken cooked on hot rocks in an underground pit – just as they have been for centuries.
One of my favorite outdoor activities we did as a group was white water rafting. A big group from Contiki chose to go together and we quickly made our way over to the park. Everyone grabbed a wet suit, prepped with helmets and water booties, hopped into a car and made our way over to the river we were rafting. It was intense. We rafted over the highest commercialized waterfall in the world. We all held on for dear life as we just fell vertically down this raging waterfall with six of us on a raft. Water went up my nose, I just kept my eyes shut for the entire way down, and hoped we wouldn’t flip over. Happily, we just plopped right back out of the water and made it out alive! Our guide was one of the coolest guys on our trip, and he made our raft do some insane stunts through the other rougher rapids. At one point we all jumped out of the boat and held onto the bottom as we fell through a smaller waterfall. It was challenging, but the most adventurous fun I’ve experienced yet. Well worth every moment.
All this adventuring and culture exposure opened my eyes to life outside of the classroom in Los Angeles. There are countless of reasons why students should try to travel often while in school, if not to learn first hand about other cultures and educate themselves in the world they live in, but to also learn more about themselves as individuals. When we travel, we are exposed to distinct cultural perspectives and we earn a better understanding and appreciation for the nation’s people and history. Traveling gives us the opportunity to witness and even experience a new way of life and become more open minded. Traveling has also proven to help with getting greater job opportunities because what we learn and the characteristics we develop while being abroad makes us better candidates for leadership positions. When we’ve returned with a new perspective on culture, a new list of language skills, a willingness to learn, and an eagerness to explore, we’re only building on the best qualities that will translate into an incredible employee in the work field. Lastly, college is the time for ‘finding yourself’ and there’s nothing quite like being on your own in a foreign country. Students who study abroad or travel while in school become explorers of their new nation and really discover curiosity and excitement that they may harbor. We have the chance to discover ourselves, all while gaining an understanding of a different culture. It’s the most beautiful learning we can do.
Contiki offers loads of trips and adventures around the globe for students, and the best thing about them is that even if you decide to travel alone, you won’t be alone for long. In each tour, you’re with about 25 other young adults around the same age group and you all become explorers together through your journey. It’s incredibly simple to make friends with the other travelers on Contiki and even along your journey when you meet locals. These are friendships you often take back home with you and keep forever. Now Trojans, that’s how you truly build an international network.
So travel while you can and travel while you’re young! See the world, make new friends, learn first hand about other cultures and ways of life, and lastly, learn about yourself and figure out what you truly want in this world. The world is your oyster, go explore.

Remember Ocean’s Eleven, the brilliantly acted, written and directed thriller about a Las Vegas casino heist by Danny Ocean’s band of thieves? Now imagine a medieval setting, cheesier writing and worse acting, where George Clooney gets beheaded in the first 15 minutes and Andy Garcia cries in every scene. In that moment of imagination, you have Last Knights, a film that hardly deserves the limited and on-demand release it has received.
Clive Owen, of Words and Pictures, Shadow Dancer and The Knick fame, plays Raiden, a dreadfully tragic hero who succeeds his medieval master, Bartok (Morgan Freeman), and leads a band of swordsmen to infiltrate the compound of Aksel (Gezza Mott), a corrupt second-in-command to the woefully blase emperor (Peyman Moaadi).
Poor Morgan Freeman. Advertised as one of the film’s superstars, audiences will surely be saddened by the beheading of Freeman’s character within the film’s first minutes — not because it is a particularly sad or emotional moment, but because the film literally kills off its only talented actor in a scene that tries so hard not to be violent that it resembles a glorified hair cut.
From there, cue Ocean’s Eleven knockoff. Besides the fact that it is never actually clear who these knights bear historical resemblance to, it seems that the time it takes to sit through the film is roughly equivalent to the years that have passed between the age of the Last Knights and today. If you enjoy sword fighting for sword fighting’s sake, a bunch of trumpet noises and some lines that could have been borrowed from a George Bush speech pre-Iraq invasion (“You must always be on alert”), then you’ll love the film. But if you are prone to sleepiness on a five-hour car ride and find yourself skeptical after watching a single man slaughter 30 obese, armored henchmen that run toward him at the same time, save your money.
Unfortunately, Last Knights is just an all-around bad film. Usually, reviewers can squeak out some rosy praise for the music, the sweeping and breathtaking scenery, or even the font selected for the credits. But with this film,there was nothing positive to speak of. In bizarre thousand-yard stare after bizarre thousand-yard stare, after looking into the eyes of Owen far longer than any human on planet Earth should, all one can think is: “Bad cinematography, bad cinematography…”
Elevator talk is one of the most fun things about press screenings. After a particularly bad film, the ride down to the parking garage is always dreadfully silent. To break the silence and inject some sense of humor into a group of people who are somber about the dreadful fashion in which they have just wasted two hours of their lives, some blog reviewer or newspaper columnist always comes through with a stab of humor. Ironically, it’s usually a funnier joke than anything said in the movie.
This time, like most times, that person didn’t disappoint.
“Could Clive Owen storm the White House?” someone wondered. In that moment, despite all of the criticism levied above, the sheer impracticality of the mission Owen and company happen upon was captured perfectly. This one is really bad. In his most intoxicated state of mind, M. Night Shyamalan could have fallen asleep on his keyboard and come up with a better plot twist.
In that sense, perhaps there is a redeeming silver lining to Last Knights. Should a group of friends find themselves in woeful boredom on a Wednesday night, when everything from Home Depot to the petting zoo to the creepy bowling alley is closed, dig into your couch cushions for some change and buy this film on pay-per-view. (Please don’t use credit cards, cash or any other semblance of real money — the film doesn’t deserve it.) If you’ve gotten this far, try out the following Last Knights drinking game, which should, of course, be played with water (hydrate, kids!).
First, a gulp every time you get uncomfortable when Owen stares into the eyes of the camera for too long. Second, a swig every time you wonder why a character hasn’t managed to die amid a lengthy sword fight. Third, an extra-big sip when said character actually dies, and a bonus drink if it happens by a beheading which you don’t see because you are still staring into the eyes of Owen.
To those still willing to experience a boring film, or those desperately in need of a social Wednesday night, there is only one thing to say: sweet dreams.

Like many of you reading this column, my past two weeks have been spent watching one of the best sporting events of the year: March Madness. From massive upsets in the first round — UAB and Georgia State in particular — to a No. 7 seed making the Final Four, this tournament has been fairly exciting, though not as great as past seasons.
The NCAA Tournament has never been more popular, posting the largest average overnight ratings in over 25 years. Last Sunday’s regional final between Duke and Gonzaga earned the best overnight rating for a regional game in over 10 years.
While the men’s tournament has rolled on basking in the national spotlight, however the women’s tournament is being played in the shadows.
This topic of discussion came up recently in my sports and technology class taught by Professor Jeff Fellenzer. While discussing the NCAA Tournament, a girl in my class asked Professor Fellenzer if he thought that the women’s tournament would ever become as popular as the men’s. What was supposed to be a simple question turned into a 20-minute debate about what could make the women’s tournament grow, leaving me contemplating the issue ever since.
In my opinion, the first and most important step for the NCAA to take is to reschedule the women’s tournament. As seen with a majority of professional sports, fans often choose to watch men’s sports over women’s — that’s just a fact. While no one expects the women’s tournament to challenge the men’s in terms of popularity, playing them at the same time basically inhibits any growth for women’s basketball.
The NCAA should follow the WNBA, which has shown signs of growth, and schedule its women’s and men’s tournaments at different times. Imagine if people were given the chance to watch March Madness twice. The buzzer beaters, Cinderella stories and other madness are all there, just hidden behind the shadows of the men’s tournament.
Another major factor that needs to be addressed for women’s college basketball is competitiveness. Out of 32 possible championships, 17 have gone to two schools, UConn and Tennessee.
Take this year as an example of how competitiveness is skewed in women’s basketball. In the Elite Eight, when teams are playing the best within their region, the average margin of victory was 12 points in the women’s tournament compared to just seven in the men’s game.
The No. 1 overall seed UConn Huskies have won the past two championships and look poised to claim their third-in-a-row this season. The Huskies have outscored their opponents by an audacious 164 points in just four games.
While changing the date of the women’s tournament and making the game more competitive will help, Professor Fellenzer suggested a great idea that I believe could make the women’s game more exciting to watch: lowering the basket.
Since the departure of Brittney Griner to the WNBA, there has not been a single slam dunk in women’s college basketball. Heck, in the history of women’s collegiate basketball, only seven players have ever dunked. It makes no sense to me why the height of the basket is 10 feet when the average height of a women’s basketball player is under 6 feet.
What makes the men’s game so entertaining is the jaw-dropping dunks, freak athleticism and plays that make the audience gasp. Lowering the basket would allow the athletes to show off their athleticism, while also evening the playing field. Though this change would probably never happen, it’s fun to fantasize about a league in which women are dunking at the same frequency as men.
One tidbit to point out is the fact that women’s basketball is one of the only sports that uses the same rules and requirements as its men’s equivalent. In volleyball they have lower nets, in lacrosse less pads, and in softball they pitch underhand.
The idea of lowering the baskets would most certainly be met with some criticism and skepticism. Change can cause some uproar from athletes and media alike; however, I truly believe that lowering the basket would help enhance the appeal of women’s basketball.
Though these are all fun suggestions, the women’s tournament has the ability to grow under the right circumstances. Only time will tell if the NCAA makes the appropriate changes to grow the game.

Until yesterday, Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act — signed into law by Gov. Mike Pence — attempted to mimic similar legislation passed by the federal government and 19 other states, but it stupendously failed.
In its original form, the law allowed persons, businesses and any other private entity to refuse to provide service to people of different races, sexual orientations or gender identities on the basis of religious belief, and use the law as a defense if they were ever sued for it. Yesterday, Pence signed an addendum to the law undoing that and clarifying that the law could not be used in that manner. But Indiana, like many states, still does not include sexual orientation in the list of categories protected by its anti-discrimination law, and that must change.
Nineteen other states have RFRAs, and the federal government also passed one in 1993 that sailed through the Senate on a 97-3 vote and was signed by former President Bill Clinton. These laws attempt to impose the following basic protection: If the government wants to “substantially burden a person’s free exercise of religion,” it must demonstrate a “compelling government interest” and act in the least restrictive way of doing so.
But even these laws are too broad and have since been extended far beyond the original intent of their supporters, which was “to be about benign and relatively uncontroversial matters, such as allowing Muslim jail inmates to wear closely trimmed beards, or assuring that churches could feed homeless people in public parks.” Seventeen of the law’s original supporters in Congress have since withdrawn their endorsement, especially after the highly controversial Hobby Lobby decision. There, the Supreme Court gave companies the right to refuse to provide birth control for employees on the basis of religious belief — a provision that was mandatory in the Affordable Care Act — and the court cited the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act as grounds for doing so. Not only is the law now being used to deny women access to birth control, but the federal government, like Indiana, has yet to recognize sexual orientation as a category protected by anti-discrimination laws.
The common thread woven in each of these strings is as follows: The right to free religion is not absolute and must be reconciled with other important rights, namely the right of women and LGBTQ people to be treated equally under the law. Waiters should serve them at restaurants, just like firefighters should put out a fire at a home regardless of the sexual orientation of the people who live there. It is time to stop treating LGBTQ people like second-class citizens, which brings to mind an important, larger question: Why hasn’t Indiana, 29 other states and the federal government passed laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation?
The battles over discrimination are not going to be won and lost in debating broad pieces of legislation that ostensibly protect the freedom of religion; they are going to begin there, and anti-discrimination laws can’t get lost in the noise. Especially when it comes to states that have passed laws protecting religious freedom, of the 19 that have done so, only two also have laws the prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
That some states have selectively chosen to protect religious freedom but still battle gay marriage and countless other measures to protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination represents just how far the needle still has to move on the United States’ moral compass. All of the energy directed at opposing the old iteration of Indiana’s religious freedom law should be martialed into exactly that cause. People should not rest until every state and the federal government not only recognize gay marriage, but also enshrine into law the right of people not to be discriminated by their employers on the basis of sexual orientation.
So let’s further equality because it remains fundamentally important, not just because Indiana decided to attack it. It is easy to oppose infringement of certain rights, but it is another matter entirely to support expanding rights altogether. The media has a woefully short memory, and the Indiana debate has created a moment that might not come again soon. The momentum cannot be squandered. The incredible energy that has been directed at Indiana has taken us off the ledge, but it shouldn’t prevent us from running toward higher ground.

Nate – You’re right about the needle on the United States’ moral compass, but I think you’re confused about the DIRECTION it should move.  “Tolerance” works both ways, and people should understand that religious Americans (particularly Christians) are on the right side of our nation’s history when it comes to liberties and freedoms.  Of all places in the world, the United States is not where a Christian should need to defend his rights or practices, including their feelings about homosexuality.  Thankfully our nation’s religious and Christian founders guaranteed, constitutionally, that others (perhaps like yourself) could practice any religion they like… or no religion at all.  But never was there any intention for the government or society to intrude or mold or undermine the full and free practice of their Christianity.  These are the facts and I’m unnerved that many in our modern society don’t understand this.
You and many others should probably read up a little on active versus passive rights.  Christians and other religious people in our society MUST be tolerant of all people, including homosexuals, regardless of their religious beliefs.  (Indeed, Christianity preaches hate for sin but love for the sinner.)  But this concept is quite different from forcing someone of a particular religious conviction to actively or conscientiously perform an act or behaviour that is a conflict for them and their faith.  We see this precedent all the time in such things as conscientious objectors for military service or parents who don’t want certain medical care or vaccinations for their children.  You learn in law school that there are many rights we enjoy that stop or are suspended when they encroach on someone else’s rights.
The above notwithstanding, I’ve always found that Democrats and liberals focus way too much on rights, instead of responsibilities.  I find that time spent on the latter is considerably more rewarding, and leads to abundantly more true “tolerance” than liberals could even imagine.

Last Monday, George Zimmerman, the infamous neighborhood watchman accused of and later acquitted for the murder of Trayvon Martin, posted a video of what appears to be an attempt at public exoneration of himself. Zimmerman reflected upon the night of Trayvon’s death, saying, “I believe God does everything for a purpose. Only in a true life-or-death scenario can you have mental clearness to know that you cannot feel guilty for surviving.”
This excerpt is just one section of the 14-minute video, and yet it perfectly captures the kind of systemic racial problems that pervade the country. First, it is doubtful that Zimmerman operates on any clearness, given he refers to an event in which he murdered an unarmed teenager as a “life-or-death” experience. If that kind of victim-based rhetoric is used, it should be to discuss Martin’s own inability to survive after he was shot by Zimmerman’s 9 mm semiautomatic gun. Second, the fact that Zimmerman explicitly states that he feels no remorse for killing a child is alarming — no matter the circumstances.
Far more revealing, however, is Zimmerman’s reply when asked if he had evolved from the man he was five years ago: “Absolutely not. I’ve had to have my guard up significantly. I have to look over my shoulder on a daily basis, several times a day.” This answer represents a myopic worldview prevalent among far too many Americans. In this racially driven case, Zimmerman sees himself as the victim, failing to understand his own contribution to a racist system and the racial privilege from which it stems. When he complains about his own anxiety and fear of unwarranted aggression, Zimmerman does not consider that the same feeling bears a heavy burden on the lives of millions of people as they take careful precautions with law enforcement.
Whether he wants to admit it or not, Zimmerman’s statement comes from a place of privilege. In 2015, minorities make distinctly different calculations than their white counterparts when dealing with law enforcement. While racial minorities are forced to consider inherent racial bias and assumptions of criminality, whites don’t even encounter these challenges on an everyday basis. Young black men are taught how to behave, what to wear and what to say so as not appear too suspicious — a lesson that doesn’t seem to even enter the white consciousness. Study after study has substantiated these claims and concerns, like in Arizona, where the state highway patrol was 3.5 times more likely to search a stopped Native American than a white person and 2.5 times more likely to search a stopped African-American or Hispanic. When George Zimmerman bemoans his new challenging lifestyle, he exhibits a complete ignorance of a struggle that plagues millions of others, not because they murdered a teenager, but because of the color of their skin. It isn’t just George Zimmerman. Rather, he is the product of a system in denial.
According to the Pew Research Center, 49 percent of whites were satisfied with the Zimmerman verdict and 21 percent didn’t have an opinion, while only 5 percent of African-Americans reported feeling satisfied and 9 percent didn’t have an opinion. If this doesn’t indicate a division within the American experience, these numbers should: 60 percent of whites responded to the survey by saying that the racial component of the case received more attention than it deserved, while only 13 percent of blacks felt the same way. This polling alludes to the dangerous belief in a post-racial America that race no longer needs to be discussed.
George Zimmerman’s comments need to begin a dialogue surrounding our consciousness of racial divisions. People are all subject to subliminal prejudices embedded in society and entrenched in our everyday experiences. It’s time to acknowledge it. Looking at cases like Trayvon Martin and saying “Well, that’s them, and not me” isn’t working. Zimmerman’s attempt to distance himself from his own actions also isn’t working. He only presents further proof that there’s a fundamental disconnect between the United States’ racial narratives — one only further buttressed by a denial of racial privilege.
Zimmerman, The guy who was in such fear of Trayvon..” He’s coming toward me..he’s got his hand in his waistband”..”I don’t know where this kid is” that he doesn’t think keeping a 911 dispatcher on the phone till the cops get there is necessary. In fact near the end of the call he seems quite eager to end that call..
Non emergency dispatcher, and everyone in the past that has run toward the rear entrance continues out and is never seen again. The assumption by both Zimmerman and dispatch is that this person has done the same and there may be little point in having the police come out, but Zimmerman agrees to wait for them and fill out a report etc. The neighborhood has a burglary problem, not an angry teen beats up people problem, so Martin’s actions were completely unexpected.
I think you miss my point. Zimmerman was in fear of his life. Or at least tried to give that impression Why would he want to end a call with the police if he was in fear of his life?
The whole Z family has become a pack of whining grifters looking for attention and cash support.  Despicable racists.
what a bunch of crap. Defending one life against a violent aggressor is a right all share in every state. You probably are so ignorant that you don’t know that CA SYG law is more liberal than Florida, not the SYG was actually relevant, it wasn’t. Just another media LIE. 
The only racists are the Martin, Fulton and their shyster attorneys who  constructed the “great white defendant” to execute their shake down. I doubt current USC students have a clue as to the literary reference I used. hint read Tom Wolfe. 
Ask yourself WHY did grifter Sybrina NOT sue Z in a civil case. Answer- ping logs and text messages from Trayvon phone come into court along with his history as of burglaries.
The ONLY racial privilege associated with this case benefits the Martin family. The media protected them from being exposed as the LIARS they are. 
What a twisted essay built on nonsense.
You show me a Black man calculating how to deal with law enforcement, and I’ll show you a gangbanger.
Thanks to the Gunshine State of Florida, George’s parents and 6 jurors — this remorseless sociopath is free.
Place Zimmerman’s minor injuries on any other person, and his supporters would be writing “sick, whining crybaby”.
You sound like you don’t have a clue to the nature of his injuries, but that is beside the point, Martin wasn’t shot for beating Zimmerman, he was shot when he reached for his gun to kill him.
Zimmerman was a stupid hothead who tried to be policeman. He had no business shadowing that nasty young tough. The tough was beating Zimmerman’s head on the sidewalk, and Zimmerman, like an idiot, drew his pistol and shot him.Fine, we know that. So who cares what Zimmerman says today? For better or worse, his trial is over. This article reads like a junior high column, though. “no remorse for killing a child.”  A child? Seventeen, 5′ 11″, and already a junior thug. “Dialog?” “Narratives?” What we need is not more chatter, but less stupid hotheads like Zimmerman.
Martin beat Zimmerman for a minute with no harm to himself of any kind while Zimmerman screamed for help and tried to get away. Martin was not shot because of this beating, not judged or punished for the beating. Martin was shot because when he saw Zimmerman was armed he didn’t stop his attack. No different from both of them spotting a rock, the first one to get it is the one who lives. The main difference between the situations Martin and Zimmerman faced is that all Martin needed to do was stop his attack and no harm would have come to him. Zimmerman was looking at death if Martin gained control of the gun.
The case was never about race, half the residents of the complex were dark skinned minorities like Zimmerman and Martin.
Your comment doesn’t make sense.  The part about why Martin was shot anyways.
Zimmerman did no harm to Martin of any kind until Martin saw his gun and reached for it saying you are going to die tonight. Zimmerman got to the gun first, so he lived instead of died.
Zimmerman gospel.
Forensic facts.
Your comment is an hysterical, bloated lie.
What, you mean the hard facts I have related don’t agree with the story the Martin’s lawyer made up with publicist Ryan Julison and sold to media? You do understand though that when they made up the story they didn’t have any real access to what happened or who Zimmerman was, just some fragments from a illegally leaked police report?
Sad in funny way you still believe any of the lies they told and the media passed on, but genuinely pathetic that you still believe all of it.
Zimmerman isn’t white, only his last name.
Zimmerman isn’t a racist, he is a life long advocate for racial justice active in his community.
Zimmerman never approached Martin, Martin ran away and came back 80 yards from hiding sneaking up behind Zimmerman.
Are you sure?
Because it was written on Zimmerman’s Hispanic skinhead face that he was the good guy ? One moment you are minding your own business walking home. You realize that you are being followed by car. You try to get away. You realize that the creep starts running after you. Adrenaline is pumping. You get in a fight. Suddenly you realize that the creep is armed. Is the creep less dangerous now that he has a gun? You let him draw it? If all you have to do when you get in a fight is to stop fighting to walk away unharmed, why do people carry guns?
You left out reality, Not walking home, standing looking around in the rain for half a hour talking on his cell just inside a side path into the complex..
Trayvon does not TRY to get away, he easily runs out of Zimmerman’s sight in seconds. Runs 80 yards from the area Zimmerman stops at, then four minutes later sneaks back and beats Zimmerman.
No fight, just one person pounding the other with no harm of any kind done to Trayvon, while his victim tries to get away and screams for help.
Creep? Why not use the actual term Trayvon used, “Creepy, as s cracker”, urban slang for gay molester.
When you see the person you have attacked and beaten, that has done no harm to you is armed, the sane thing to do is STOP the attack, not make it a life and death struggle. Regardless its clear self defense for Zimmerman to shoot his attacker to prevent him from getting to his gun and killing him.
Once a threat ends, so does the lawful use of force. Zimmerman would not have shot Trayvon if he stopped the attack. An unlawful person, say an angry teen kicked out of his mother house and put on a bus to strange town that is beating a stranger for looking gay, the opposite is true. Zimmerman would be dead, Trayvon would have the 9mm he was hoping to get, and be back in Miami the next morning bragging to his friends.
How did GZ know that TM was on his cell for half an hour? Are you saying that Zimmerman followed his suspect for the duration of the phone call ? How else can he know when the phone call started? Have you ever been followed by a stranger during half an hour ?  Creepy or not? Or only creepy if the person following has a darker complexion than the person being followed?
What’s the most suspicious behavior.
– a  white teenager on a phone in the rain between 6:54 and 7:12. (phone records)
– a black male following and observing a white male on the phone in the rain for half an hour?
– a black teenager as TM sitting in a car in the middle of the night observing the back of a gun shop (as GZ in july 2014)?
GZ was at a 10 seconds running distance when asked by the dispatcher if he was following him. He got in a fight 4 minutes later at the top of the T walking back after having continued to search for his suspect all the way to Retreat View. Nobody knows where TM was all that time. For all we know he can have been hiding all the time close to the top of the T ,without knowing where his pursuer was.
Tell me what ‘s the sane thing to do, if you have been looking for someone down a dark alley with a flashlight and if that person confronts you and asks you why you are following him.
– identify as a concerned neighborhood watch captain  
– remain silent and reach into your pocket or waistband for an unidentified object.
GZ decided to get into his pockets and got hit before he could draw Try following a cop and reach into your waistband when he confronts you instead of reassuring him that you have no bad intentions..
Zimmerman only knows Martin in standing in the rain looking around and that he is not a resident. We know Martin was standing there for half an hour due to the rest of the evidence, time he left 7/11 and Rachel Jeantel’s testimony and the phone logs.
Zimmerman and Martin have essentially the same complexion.
Martin is reported to police because he meets the police standard for being reported, not recognized as a resident and not going about his business, acting suspicious. Martin is using a headset, so Zimmerman has no way of knowing this is why he is looking around acting strange.
Jeantel testified Martin was near his daddy’s house, Brandy Green’s condo. Independently Zimmerman tells the dispatcher on the recording that Martin has disappeared from his sight toward the rear entrance. Look at an aerial view of the complex, there isn’t a place to be out of sight within 60 feet of where Zimmerman stopped. Martin went south, Zimmerman walked east to the street to get an address to direct the police to, as the same street name circled the whole complex making it useless without an address.
Strawman, Martin confronts Zimmerman from behind about five feet away saying “Do you have a problem?” and continuing to approach. Zimmerman says “No” and digs for his cell phone, then while his guard is down Martin punches him in the face as hard as he can, breaking his nose and knocking him to the ground, Martin sits on him continuing the beating. There is NO indication that Martin thinks Zimmerman has a weapon, as there would be if you believe that started the attack. Martin’s attack is focused on silencing his screaming victim, with no struggle for a weapon until a minute later when the jacket rides up.
You need to look at a photo of the complex, its wide open between the rows of condos, whoever is approaching the other person will see them from a good 30 yards away. Martin could have asked his question regardless of what it was from 20 yards away. The only reason to sneak up so close behind Zimmerman is as a prelude to an attack.
Screaming for help for a minute didn’t stop Martin’s beating, saying he was neighborhood watch might have made it worse. Martin’s last fight at school was with someone who snitched on him according to his cell phone messages.
If Zimmerman didn’t know how long TM had been there in the rain, then the duration of the phone call is irrelevant to what happened, unless you think that TM brought this upon him by taking the risk that somebody might see him hanging around in the rain, without realizing that he was on a cell talking to a girl.
Same complexion? Next you’ll tell that Salma Hayek can one day be cast as Michelle Obama.
Ban headsets.Or phone while sitting in a car as Zimmerman.
Any place in the alley is “near his daddy’s house” after covering 90% of the 0.7 mile walk from the 7 11 store. The girl has no way of knowing what “near” means.
If Walter Scott had been filmed digging in his pockets, while being tazered unsuccessfully or even while running away police officer Michael Slager would have had a better defense. Without video footage you would have believed that the tazer fell where the body was located.
Night was falling. Zimmerman pretends that fear paralyzed him when he didn’t manage his flashlight to work while on Retreat View Circle. If he could see 30 yards why did he need a working flashlight to get back to his car? 
Zimmerman said that Martin came out of the bushes. No bushes there but screens at the back of the houses. For all is known the scenario where TM hid just south of the top of the T, knowing that the man in the truck ran after him, and got up once Zimmerman closed up on his hiding place armed with his flashlight is just as plausible as the one where he made it all the way home and came back..
GZ didn’t know anything about TM. After having been arrested for assault on a police officer in plain clothes GZ should have been prepared to identify.
The story Crump and Julison made up, and most of the media carried was that Martin was walking home, a situation where nobody would have paid any attention to him, but a total lie based on the evidence and testimony. It is relevant to discarding the whole of the Crump story as the fiction it is.
What is relevant to Zimmerman is that Martin was not recognized as a resident, which he was not, and he was not going about his business. Those are the criteria of Sanford PD and most others for reporting someone as suspicious.
Without a flash or photoshop, Martin and Zimmerman are close enough in skin tone and neither of them would ever be mistaken for white. Zimmerman’s African ancestry isn’t as visible, but that doesn’t change the facts of his racial heritage.
Anyplace in the “alley” would still be in sight of someone at the T. Jeantel doesn’t guess the location, she testifies that Trayvon says he is at his Daddy’s house, but decides not to go in.
I don’t comment on cases with partial information, and too little is known so far in the Scott case to say other than it shares little to nothing with the Martin case.
Zimmerman tried to get his flashlight working while looking for a street address to pass on to the police, but nothing suggests he thinks Martin has not run out the rear entrance, or that he is being any more than cautious in giving out his home address. Listen to the dispatch recording, its calm once Martin runs out of his sight.
Once again, educate yourself, many images of the complex are online, including the walk thru Zimmerman gives the police the next day, there isn’t anyplace in the central area to hide except the passage between segments of the two rows of condo’s a good 80 feet away from the crime scene. Far from plausible, its ridiculous as well as contradicted by Jeantel’s testimony. Jeantel specifically says Trayvon sees Zimmerman, and goes to confront him.
If Zimmerman walked south, the direction Martin ran in, he would be easily vivible at a great distance to anyone looking north. Zimmerman walking west towards his truck would place Martin behind him, out of sight and unknown until he chose to speak.
GZ pushed a cop that grabbed his friend without identifying himself as cop. No injury of any kind, but he was still arrested. Later events supported the cop not identifying himself.
Martin got his last suspension for fighting with, in Martin’s words on his cell, someone who snitched on him. Other than gay bashing, beating up Zimmerman for calling police is the second most likely situation, so telling Martin he is neighborhood watch is not likely to stop a beating where screaming for help doesn’t work.
1. TM was walking home minding his own business, phoning.
2. GZ can report him as suspicious
3. but when  GZ gets out of his car to follow TM he is himself acting suspiciously to a teenager who was minding his own business. What could have been relevant to TM and led him into thinking that GZ was not a concerned citizen,  is that the shaved head in the car did not roll down the window to identify himself as such. If he had known about neighborhood watch rules the sole fact that GZ came after him, could have make him think that he was not a watch. Didn’t Jeantel warn TM that it could be a ‘rapist’ ? Their anxiety seems genuine.
4. Are you saying that GZ’s brother, Robert with the same Afro Peruvian heritage can not ever be mistaken for white? He just dresses up better and seems better educated than his brother George. Fact is that the Zimmerman brothers can not ever be mistaken for Afro American. The fact of their racial heritage is irrelevant. Hitler might have had a Jewish grand father and was apparently aware of it. Is that proof that he can not have had a grudge against Jews?
Jeantel said that he was “right by his daddy’s house”. and that might not even have been TM’s exact words. That can be anywhere in the alley leading directly to the house.
I watched the reenactment video. You could hide a small horse behind the white screens. Suppose he was hiding behind one of those screens close to the T. Suppose he sees GZ checking the top of the T with his flashlight walking E-W. Suppose he makes the bad decision to get out of hiding and to walk up to him to ask him why he is following him. What’s wrong with that? And then GZ decides to get into his pockets and this adrenaline fueled situation gets out of hand.
I am not judging GZ for the assault of a po incident. Just saying that after that incident he should have known better than to follow a teenager without being prepared to identify. GZ  was carrying a gun. He knew that he had to avoid getting into a fight. 
Guess we’ll never know if identifying would have calmed things down. It’s just the normal thing to do. GZ didn’ know anything about TM’s school suspensions for fighting.
Sorry but that is a lie, Martin is NOT walking home. He isn’t walking anywhere, he is standing in the same area looking around while passing the time on the phone to various people.
Its a gated community, anyone in a car came through a gate and is likely a resident. Martin is not a resident, nothing in evidence suggests he was even an invited guest. Sabrina put him on a bus to Sanford, but Brandy Green and Tracey Martin were out of town, with just 14 year old Chad Green at the condo. Its possible Brandy Green was “ok” with Trayvon doing drugs in the condo alone with Chad, its also possible he was not a welcome guest.
Your attempt to profile Zimmerman as a skinhead falls far short of credibility, his hair was short, but not as short as was depicted in the old mug shot the media used. Regardless your profiling based on appearance is disgusting.
Robert Zimmerman looks more like his father than his mothers side of the family, which has nothing to with how George looks, which is clearly on his mothers side, Afro Peruvian.
Zimmerman is watching Martin run south, hiding in a screened area would have been visiable, stopping short of Brandy Green’s condo would make no sense. Regardless the distance was substantial and sufficient to discard the notion that Zimmerman approaches him.
Martin can ask questions from 30 feet away, sneaking up behind Zimmerman until he was close enough to strike is what he actually did. Martin punched him in the nose as his first act, then with Zimmerman helpless and bleeding on the ground and ZERO threat to Martin, Martin sat on him holding him down and beat him for a minute while Zimmerman did nothing but scream for help and try to get away.
Think about what you said, “GZ was carrying a gun. He knew that he had to avoid getting into a fight.” This is a big reason why Zimmerman would NEVER approach a stranger close enough to be attacked. Would never willingly engage in a physical struggle.
No identifying is NOT the normal thing to do, staying away and watching from a distance is the normal thing to do. Neighborhood Watch has no authority, no identification as NW, and the complex has a NW sign at every entrance.
You pick the reason Martin gives Zimmerman a beating; reporting him to police, or looking gay and watching him. None of the other suggested reasons hold up, Martin certainly was not afraid of the smaller defenseless looking man.
Doesn’t matter if he walks or halts while phoning. He’s minding his own business. Talking to various people or to Rachel? 
“Yet by that winter night, he’d been there for seven days, (…) His father Tracy had taken his son four hours away from home (…)”  (source CNN may 23, 2012)
I went through 6 mugshots. Don’t know where he has less hair than on the one where he is ‘bleeding’.
Zimmerman didn’t watch Martin run south. He stopped running 10 seconds after getting out of his car, then continued walking east. At that moment he’s not at the top of the T. Martin on the other hand doesn’t know that GZ stopped running, so he can expect his pursuer to arrive at the top of the T before he can make it home unseen. That’s a good reason to decide to hide, if the alternative is leading he creepy acting character to your front door. 
TM punched a shaved head pursuer who reached into his pockets for an unidentified object instead of trying to defuse the situation by explaining why he was following him. Next time you get pulled over, why don’t you try to reach in your pockets while a police officer expects you to identify yourself.
Zero threat? When you get into a fistfight with a possibly armed individual, that individual represents zero threat? You sure have lots of certainties about what’s going on in the minds of
GZ and TM. In one of your previous posts you wrote “Once a threat ends,
so does the lawful use of force. Zimmerman would not have shot Trayvon
if he stopped the attack.”  Do you expect a random citizen, possibly a criminal,  to have higher self control or highr morals than the police officer who shot Walter Scott in the back running away from him?
To avoid getting in a fight he should have stayed out of that alley. Didn’t the kid come to check him out already while he was still sitting in his car? Wasn’t that enough? What about the once bitten twice shy ?
Staying away. That’s exactly what the dispatcher asked him to do. But GZ knew better…Of course NW do not have authority. They are not supposed to follow or confront, they are supposed to watch. When TM ran and probably heard the man in the car coming after him, was he thinking I’m being watched or I’m being chased after?
Wrong, regardless of which hate source you got your made up information, it does not match the facts.
Martin is minding his own business, whether that business is innocent we will never know, and it does not matter, it is what his behavior looks like to a reasonable person with the same information that Zimmerman has; standing in the rain looking around, not walking anyplace, and not recognized as a resident.
CNN isn’t the source, they are just repeating what Crump and Julison pass on, Martin was put on a bus and sent to Sanford. Yet that winter night dozens of residents in the area near Brandy Green’s were questioned by police and NOBODY mentioned a teen visitor from Miami.
Why do you use the racial slur “skinhead”? It has no meaning in reference to a Latino.
Zimmerman ran east for about 12 seconds and stopped in the area of the T, with a full view between the rows of condo’s to the street at the rear entrance. Martin will not be out of his sight and location unknown until he cuts through between a segment of the condo’s. Zimmerman doesn’t walk east to the next street for an address until the call to dispatch has ended about 90 seconds later, long after Martin is out of his sight. There is no reason to assume Martin has not run out the rear entrance, or to suspect he will come back and attack Zimmerman.
Jeantel makes no mention that Martin is aware that Zimmerman watched him run south, and indicates surprise when he sees Zimmerman most likely messing with his flashlight at the other end of the street.
Bully gay bashing vigilante Martin is not a cop, and has no business attacking anyone whether he thinks they are armed or not. You keep using the  false term “pursuer” for Zimmerman who never approached Martin, its a lie.
Zero threat should be obvious, Martin knocked him down with one punch, easily ran away, and now Zimmerman is flat on his back bleeding from a broken nose, how much less of threat could someone be? How about after a minute of beating the person with no harm of any kind to yourself, is that past your threshold of no threat?
Its called not being stupid, if Zimmerman wanted to shoot Trayvon he could have done it from his truck at no risk to himself. If Martin stops the attack, does that hands up stuff and stops being a threat, then shooting him is murder and NOTHING suggests that Zimmerman meant him any harm of any kind. An intelligent view would be that 99.9% of the time Martin could have rolled off Zimmerman and ran away with nothing whatsoever happening to him.
Why is it at the time Zimmerman is watching Martin run south that you suggest Martin is too dangerous to watch? Martin has committed no crime, is it perhaps a racist view you have of Martin that Zimmerman does not share?
No the dispatcher did not suggest he stay away, he said we don’t need you to do that, in regards to following Martin at a distance to watch him. Also Zimmerman later said when the dispatch said that he realized it was a good idea and agreed with it.
Nothing suggests when Martin ran he was aware Zimmerman got out of his truck to watch where he was running to.
Zimmerman never approaches or confronts, and he stops trying to watch Martin. Four minutes later, non resident Martin comes back to resident Zimmerman and beats him, not because Martin is afraid, or Zimmerman poses him any threat, but the opposite, he thinks Zimmerman is gay and defenseless, a punching bag for Martin’s personal frustrations.
Serino believed Zimmerman’s observations were “faulty”. Also considering the time and day, the person he was on the phone with, and the fact Martin looked directly at Zimmerman and stared at him long enough for him to identify him it is highly unlikely he was casing houses. We also know now that Zimmerman’s wife left him the night before the incident which would have influenced his state of mind. 
All in all, it appears the Sanford PD correctly recommended manslaughter charges. 
Of course his ‘business’ is innocent, unless you think that he’s consulting with Rachel during 18 minutes, who’s masterminding it all from the moment he left home to buy candy.
Whether he is a skinhead or not, — and he is not — it does not matter, it’s how he looks like to a reasonable person who suddenly realizes that he is being followed. 
“There is no reason to assume Martin has not run out the rear entrance, or to suspect he will come back and attack Zimmerman.” — That’s armchair quarterbacking. You know or you don’t know if he is gone and GZ obviously didn’t know, when he was talking to the dispatcher. He didn’t know it either when he was trying to make his flashlight work once on RVC.
(Following is by Sling Trebuchet, “Zimmermamn’s call”)
” Dispatcher: Okay do you live in the area?
Zimmerman: Yeah, I…[unintelligible]
Dispatcher: What’s your apartment number?
Zimmerman: It’s a home it’s [house number removed], (knocking sound) Oh crap I don’t want to give it all out, I don’t know where this kid is.
This last response is informative. (…) this central pathway area is very dark. In addition, a series of back porch separators offer good cover for anyone who wants to hide. Zimmerman isn’t assuming that Martin has continued to run. He is aware that he might be close by. The kid might be within earshot, and therefore become aware of where Zimmerman lived – posing the possibility of thuggish action being taken against his home in the future.”
You have an issue with “skinhead” and “pursuer”, while you routinely call TM “a bully gay bashing vigilante” ? GZ started running after TM down a dark alley. That’s called following, pursuing. He didn’t need to get to his own street for a street name. His truck was parked in Twin Trees and that’s where he was supposed to wait for the police. He decided to let them call him because he didn’t know where he would be. He wanted to keep all his options, including resume pursuit if he regained sight of Martin which he lost almost immediately after getting out of his car. He never knew if he went east or south at the top of the T so he checked out the WE section.
He called for a police officer because the kid was having his hand “in his waistband” when he came to check him out. So the teenager is possibly armed and dangerous when he’s sitting in his car and no longer  down a dark alley?
GZ zero threat. I treated that. 
You don’t know anything about what was going on in Zimmerman’s mind or in Trayvon matin’s for that matter. “He stopped trying to watch Martin.”, When? After saying OK to the dispatcher? Why did he need a working flashlight, why did he lose so much time trying to make it work on RVC if he was convinced that his suspect was no longer in the area? Even Stevie Wonder could have made it from RVC in a straight line to where his truck was.
Maybe in your reality that makes sense. But in this reality a person who just moments before ran from someone would not go back to confront that person. And even if you want to belive that happen (Which given the time frame would of been impossible) why wouldn’t Trayvon who was supposedly wanted to cause Zimmerman great bodily harm not come back with a weapon? Why would he go home and then come back with his phone and items he had just purchased at 7-11? 
Reality also states that a person who got punched in the face as many times and had their skull bashed into concrete as George claims would not suffer minor injuries.
Facts are facts, Martin ran to the area near Brandy Green’s condo, Rachel Jeantel was clear about this in her testimony which matches Zimmerman’s voice on the dispatch recording saying Martin has disappeared from his sight to the south. Jeantel also testified that Martin saw Zimmerman and went back and confronted him.
Why would Martin want a weapon, he had zero fear of the smaller defenseless looking man he thought was gay. Martin went back to give him a beating with no expectation of any risk to himself, a whoopin, no reason to think he intended great bodily harm until Zimmerman started screaming for help.
Four minutes is more than sufficient time for Martin to reach Brandy Green’s condo and to come back, its about 80 yards, 160 yards total and easy walk in two to three minutes. Again, facts are facts, the crime scene is the area where Zimmerman was waiting for police, not where Martin ran to near Brandy Green’s condo.
The police on the scene and EMT saw his injuries as consistent with the nature of the attack, liars in the media claimed they were minor with no evidence to support the claim except intentionally distorted video.
When Jeantel said that Trayvon wen t back to confront she was talking about earlier that night when we heard Zimmerman say ” Now he’s coming toward me”.
Try to get your facts straight.
why wouldn’t Trayvon who was supposedly wanted to cause Zimmerman great bodily harm not come back with a weapon?
Because thugs and future felons are not that bright. Ever heard of the knockout game? You don’t need any thing else but your hands to kill someone. Reply if you think that’s not possible. How’s that reality for ya?
So really you have no logical explanation to my question. But instead just throw yet another unfounded accusation in order to sustain you’re unfounded beliefs
Well, how about this one. Martin was in a school fight not long before the TM GZ incident. I believe that is why he was suspended from school. He’s no stranger to fighting and wanted to build up his reputation by sucker punching and beating the hell out of a “creepy ass cracker”. That sounds pretty logical, don’t you think? I got more if you don’t like this one either.By the way, the correct verdict was given, good for you GZ, This story is old and stale. Darrell Davis, we’re just beating a dead horse with a stick at this point.
1. Hard to scream when you should be choking on your own blood from the broken nose
2. How could Trayvon see a gun that was holstered on George’s back if George was on his back?
Please don’t mix fantasy blog raving with clear facts, how ever hard it was to breath or scream, Zimmerman managed both, it certainly was not Trayvon screaming for help.
Again blog raving suggested that Zimmerman’s holster was in the silly location of the middle of his back, and there isn’t a place for a holster there. Just behind the bone of your hip, easily seen once Zimmerman’s jacket rides up and he is rolling from side to side to escape his attacker.
The only one racism that still exists in our country, is black racism, let us face it. Black liberation theology is a theoretical foundation of the black racism, and the practical implementors are Jeremiah Wright, Obama, Holder, Sharpton and tutti quanti.  The black racism it a dead end for the African American Community (AAC), the most troubled and dysfunctional community in the US.
 Instead of incorporating themselves in the world civilization, instead of realizing the color blind society based on mutual respect and meritocracy, is a way to go for blacks, AAC is saturated with hatred, propaganda of wrong ideas that include but not limited to abusing of affirmative action, racial hatred towards whites, racial riots to protect violent criminals, (like in Harrison where AAC were protecting a violent criminal who had robbed a Hindu shop owner with Ghandi portrait on the wall of his shop, and attacked a police officer), wrong ideas that the white racism is AAC’s the main problem.
AAC faces some serious problems that are situated inside of this community. Trayvon Martin symbolizes these problems: separated parents, suspension from school for violence and drug use, connections with street crime, suicidal tendencies to attack someone physically. Martin himself loved street fights, and advocated a decisive punch in the nose to win the battle. This is what he did to Z. The only unexpected for him thing was that Z had a gun. Martin wanted to play a knockout game on Z with impunity, and nobody said that it is a part of affirmative action for blacks – to punch with impunity, even Eric Holder wouldn’t say it, at least publicly.
Obama won elections twice because whites voted for him. If white racism was the main problem for AAC, Obama would never be elected. It means Black Liberation Theology is wrong. This Nazi style ideology has to be defeated by blacks themselves. It would be a good first step on a long road of self cleansing, self improvement, incorporating into the world civilization.
And by the way, Z is a Latino guy who tutored black kids for free, and defended a black homeless person against police. Racist? No way.
Wow.  I gotta admit, this is an impressive comment.  You managed to go from an article suggesting the need to start (continue?) a conversation in our society about the “fundamental disconnect between the United States’ racial narratives” to a ridiculous claim that the African American Community is characterized by some sort of “Nazi style ideology” … all in the space of 4 short paragraphs.  That is some impressive rhetoric.
Thank you for so thoroughly proving the author’s point.
Black Liberation Theology is the prevailing ideology of the modern AAC, and it is racist, full of hatred and is a clear form of Nazism.

Last Thursday, I was supposed to go to Lisbon. My two roommates and I had planned the getaway weeks ago, and I was beyond excited — I had been looking forward to it for weeks. The sun! The beach! The tapas! I even packed dresses and sandals.
And then it all went wrong.
When we went to book our airport shuttle, the ideal time was sold out, so we booked the next one. It was cutting it a little close, but we figured we’d be fine — we’d used the shuttle to get to the airport before and were always either on time or early, giving us plenty of time to zip through security.
But of course, that day was different. The shuttle arrived twenty minutes later, and only got later and later as it slowly inched its way to one of London’s many far-flung airports. By the time we arrived, we were an hour after schedule. Just before hopping out and sprinting into the terminal, I looked at my roommate Jordyn.
“I don’t think we’re going to make it.”
Famous last words.
But, we had to try. We ran into the airport, and because we had checked in online, straight to to security, where we saw a very long line stretching out in front of us. We informed a member of airport security about our dilemma, thinking that, like in America, they’d let us cut to the front. But oh no, this is England, so we had to pay to get a pass for the shorter, but still very present, “fastpass line.” We attempted to talk our way to the front of said line, only to meet some very unfriendly people, who informed us it was too late for us so they would not in fact let us go ahead of them.
After (finally) getting through the queue, we began to sprint. At least as far as we could. You see, of course we had the literal last gate possible in the sprawling airport. I glanced at all the information screens as we frantically rushed through the terminal, as the status for our flight went from “final boarding call” to “boarding closed.” Just a little further, I promised myself, maybe everything will work out. I arrived at the gate, which seemed to be miles from where the shuttle had dropped us off. There was no one in line. It looked deserted. Out of breath, I approached one of the Ryanair workers.
“Is there anyway we can still get on the plane?”
She turned to her coworker. The plane hadn’t left yet. Yes, they decided, they’d let us on.
That was until she saw my passport. “Where’s your stamp?”
“What stamp?”
“Your visa stamp.”
Never having heard of this “visa stamp,” I stared at her blankly. Unbeknownst to me, Ryanair requires non-EU citizen passengers to get a stamp — at the very front of the airport. Having only previously flown Ryanair to Edinburgh, a domestic flight, and never having had to do it for another airport, I hadn’t known. There was nothing she could do, the worker declared. It would take too long to go back and get the stamp so we were out of luck.
We went to the Ryanair help desk to inquire about any other flights. They had one, the next morning, for 110 pounds, a hefty sum for a budget airline ticket to a nearby country. But, just as we almost decided to spring for it, spend the night in the airport and attempt to salvage our trip, the man realized that all the flights to Lisbon were actually sold out. Until Tuesday.
No one wanted to return to our flat, so we sat in the airport, looking up other airline’s flights, calling our hostel about cancelling our reservation for that night, trying to see if we could plan another trip later on. I’d be lying if I said some tears weren’t shed by all. Eventually, drained, we headed back to the city.
On our shuttle back, I put earphones in, determined to listen to music and rest a little rather than depress myself more by thinking about the trip, and pressed shuttle. Quite fittingly, the first song that came on “Float On” by Modest Mouse.
“I backed my car into a cop car the other day / Well he just drove off sometimes life’s OK / I ran my mouth off a bit too much oh what did i Say / Well you just laughed it off it was all OK.”
Yes, my trip to Portugal was ruined and I spent yet another rainy, gray weekend in London. But that’s life. You live and you learn.

Hip-hop might not have been born in L.A., but it’s definitely taken up a permanent residence in this city. It’s no wonder that our parties are teeming with the newest hip-hop tracks and albums. When that song comes on, the crowds go crazy and everyone sings along to the lyrics — the dirtier, the better. I’m not here to judge music taste, because quite frankly, it would be a lie to say that I don’t listen to artists such as The Weeknd or Jeremih.
But what I’m really curious about is how hip-hop can get girls at parties to sing lyrics like Rae Sremmurd’s, “Come here hoe, mistletoe….Lil bitty b**ch wanna jump on this d**k”. Let’s reverse the situation and consider this: could we ever get guys to enthusiastically sing about songs that talk about them degradingly and disrespectfully?
Probably not. Unfortunately, misogyny is one of hip-hop’s hidden (but not so subtle) labels. Maybe it’s because this misogyny is excitingly subversive in our relatively forward-thinking, modern-day society. Or, considering that the large majority of hip-hop consumers are non-black, maybe it’s also a way that mainstream society likes to view black culture. There are countless theories for this misogynistic attitude is so rampant, but the real question is — will it ever change?
Though sexism in hip-hop culture is well and alive, the rise of female hip-hop artists like Nicki Minaj and Iggy Azalea might actually be good for the feminist cause. Sure, they’ve both dedicated many songs to their curves and female parts, but as women, they wield the sexual power in the song. There might be a lot of contention over lyrics like Nicki’s, “Yeah I got a big fat a**,” but the concept of flaunting female sexuality does not and should not be unfeminist. If men in hip-hop can be proud of their sexual prowess, then why should we judge women for it?
