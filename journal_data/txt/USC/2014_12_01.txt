Sarah Hamm-Alvarez, Gavin S. Herbert professor of pharmaceutical sciences, was named a 2014 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists fellow at the association’s annual meeting and exposition in November.
AAPS’s primary criterion for election to fellow status is “professional excellence in the fields relevant to the mission of AAPS,” which is “based on the individual’s documented sustained level of superior and distinguished professional achievement and contributions in a relevant field.” Recipients must be AAPS members.
Hamm-Alvarez, who is also executive vice dean and vice dean for research and graduate affairs at the School of Pharmacy and director of research development for Southern California Clinical and Translational Science Institute, is one of 17 scientists nationwide and the fourth person from the School of Pharmacy to be recognized. She was designated with this honor for her breakthrough translational research on membranes.
Hamm-Alvarez’s work made early detection of Sjögren’s syndrome possible through the discovery of pathological changes in membrane trafficking mechanisms in lacrimal gland acinar cells. Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that leads to damage of the glands that produce tears and saliva, resulting in dry mouth and eyes. It may affect other body parts such as the kidneys and lungs.
“The test we’ve developed provides a low-cost diagnostic tool that has the potential to increase early identification of Sjögren’s syndrome patients,” Hamm-Alvarez told USC News. “We’ve discovered an enzyme that is enriched in the tears when examined in our lab disease models.”
The current translational trial is moving her invention into a marketable product that can be used by ophthalmologists and optometrists to diagnose the potentially dangerous disease as simply and effectively as possible.
“This is an exciting next step for us,” Hamm-Alvarez told USC News. “It promises early diagnosis of Sjögren’s disease and early diagnosis promises better health outcomes.”
Hamm-Alvarez received a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Carleton College in 1986 and was awarded a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Duke University in 1990. At Duke, she completed a three-year postdoctoral fellowship in cell biology, and in 1993, she joined the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences faculty at USC as an assistant professor. Her other research emphases include protein-targeted drug delivery and characterizing nanoparticle interactions with cells. She has authored numerous papers and reviews in her field and lends her expertise as a reviewer of a variety of journals and grant review boards.

The Los Angeles Office of Zoning Administration held a public hearing at City Hall Nov. 25 to consider the expansion of oil drilling being conducted by the Freeport-McMoRan Oil and Gas Company in the University Park neighborhood. Dozens of community members, activists and USC undergraduates who oppose the plan flooded City Hall, unamimously demanding an environmental impact report.
Freeport-McMoRan plans to drill a new well and re-drill two existing wells in the West Adams area. The main oil drilling plant in South Los Angeles is located just a few blocks west of the University Park campus on Jefferson and Budlong Avenues. A significant number of USC undergraduates reside in that area but much of the student body is unaware of the drilling activities near campus.
Though oil and drilling companies have owned the site since the 1960s, community concern only arose a few years ago. Earlier this year, hundreds of community members gathered at a South Los Angeles church to discuss their worries concerning the company’s well proposals. Residents are particularly concerned with the extraction procedures being conducted by Freeport-McMoRan, which has been accused of injecting toxic chemicals into the ground of a residential neighborhood. When the chemicals are injected deep into the ground, they dissolve large amounts of rock and shale, which allow for the oil to be extracted. Some of these chemicals include toxic hydrochloric acid and benzene.
During the hearing, Freeport-McMoRan representatives assured associate zoning administrator Maya Zaitzevsky that the chemicals being used are present in many household products.
“Those sound like really frightening names but they are routinely used in personal care products,” said L. Rae Connet, a representative of Freeport-McMoRan.
The company representatives provided a list of household products that contain some of the same chemicals.
The Environmental Student Assembly and the Environmental Affairs Organization at USC have played a leading role in rallying for the opposition. Dale Solomon, a member of the EAO, said the drilling activities were both a safety and an environmental concern. For these reasons, the community was demanding a full environmental impact report from Freeport-McMoRan.
“The actions of Freeport-McMoRan say one thing only: Money above all,” Solomon said at the hearing. “Would you have your children attend the elementary school that’s two blocks away? Would you allow this in your community?”
In an effort to spread awareness of these activities on USC’s campus, Solomon and the EAO will be conducting an open meeting this Dec. 3 at 6 p.m. at Von KleinSmid Center Room 256. EAO is gravely concerned with the possibly harmful health effects of the drilling and is looking to inform USC students who share similar concerns.
Kaytee Canfield, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies, expressed her worries during an EAO meeting in November.
“Some of the workers on the site handling the chemicals have been seen wearing hazmat suits,” she said. “They are drilling right next to and under homes. Should the residents be wearing hazmat suits?”
During the Nov. 25 hearing, many West Adams residents complained about noise, odors and traffic resulting from the site on Budlong Avenue.
A U.S. Army veteran that resides in the West Adams area explained to the zoning administrator that many of the same chemicals were used for drilling in Iraq. He went on to say, however, that the Army made sure that the facilities containing chemicals such as the hydrochloric acids were segregated from housing and mass gathering areas to protect U.S. soldiers and allied residents.
“There is a reason why the FMOG employees wear so much [protective gear],” the veteran said. “We wouldn’t do this to our own soldiers, to our Afghan or Iraqi allies — we shouldn’t do it to our kids.”
Other residents were also concerned about the noise.
“There is currently noise from their routine operations that is deafening,” said Jennifer Blue, a resident who lives a mile away from the site, during the hearing.
Blue said that the residents often hear the pipes being driven into the ground.
During the hearing, Freeport-McMoRan representatives, who were all attorneys, touched on jurisdictional issues. They claimed that the zoning administration has jurisdiction over land use but there are several other agencies such as the city and county fire departments with much more technical expertise who have previously examined the site of the drilling.
“In the last five years, the facility has been inspected by one or more of these technical agencies 17 times,” Connet said.
Freeport argued that the community’s worries are understandable but often unfounded.
“We are aware that there has been heightened community concern,” Connet said.
Ivan Kumamoto, a member of the EAO and a junior majoring in business administration, argued during the hearing that Freeport-McMoRan should do more for the community.
“If they claim to be so responsible to the community, the least they can do, the very minimal thing they can do is to provide a third-party environmental impact statement,” Kumamoto said.

Professor Michael Tesler from the University of California, Irvine presented a lecture, “Priming Predispositions and Changing Policy Positions,” to discuss how citizens change their minds regarding politics in the Von Kleinsmid Center on Monday morning. The event was hosted by the Department of Political Science as part of its visiting speaker series.
Primetime · UC Irvine Professor Michael Tesler discusses the role of priming in forming political opinions during a lecture on campus Monday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Tesler, whose specializations include public opinion and race politics, received his degrees at UCLA and also taught at Brown University. He is in the process of publishing a book titled Most-Racial: The Growing Racialization of Mass Politics in the Obama Era.
Tesler began his talk by defining the difference between the social effects of priming and opinion change with political communication to citizens.
“Priming [means] that the more attention mass communications pay to a particular aspect of political life, the more citizens use this to evaluate the candidates,” Tesler said.
Tesler gave the example of a citizen changing his or her candidate preference while keeping a predetermined view on a specific issue as an instance of priming.
“Opinion change is changing my views to match my candidate’s views,” Tesler said.
Tesler believes some people tend to maintain and strengthen these views over time.
“These two depend on how crystallized people’s opinions are at the time,” Tesler said. “By crystallized, I mean that these views are hardened over time and maintain a consistency throughout someone’s life.”
One phenomenon discussed was the American electorate’s lack of information about certain policy concerns. Tesler said that some citizens tend to rely on mass media communications for their political opinions.
“Most Americans lack well-developed positions about policies. Thus, they are heavily influenced by elite positions,” Tesler said.
Tesler’s research came from analyzing events in presidential politics.
“My research involved looking at new cases to see where information is either primed or an opinion change,” he said.
Tesler examined presidential politics in administrations ranging from Eisenhower’s to Obama’s. One of the cases he brought up was the impact of Obama becoming the first president to openly support gay marriage in 2012.
Tesler explained that this statement had a significant priming effect in changing public opinion to have a more favorable view of gay marriage.
Tesler noted, however, that this priming effect was short-lived.
“In two weeks’ time, the big priming effect that changed people’s opinion decays,” Tesler said. “Priming effects will disappear as new ideas become salient.”
Tesler concluded his lecture by explaining how his research can explain some forms of political communications.
“My priming hypothesis allows for political communications to affect the overall popularity of a candidate or issue,” Tesler said. “Political party-sponsored communication shapes some political attitudes, but it does not run roughshod over all of them.”
Tesler also talked about how citizens can impact politicians by formulating their own political opinions.
“Citizens can still hold politicians accountable if they take positions,” Tesler said.

On Monday night, the USC Program Board Speakers Committee hosted noted screenwriter and speechwriter Jon Lovett in The Art of Bull$#!t, a commentary on American politics in which he reflected on his years in the White House.
Funnyman · Jon Lovett, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, encouraged students to pursue careers on Capitol Hill. — Chandler Golan | Daily Trojan
The event, which was held in Taper Hall at 8:00 p.m., was open to all USC students and faculty.
“We bring a multitude of speakers every year to discuss topics relating to education, diversity and cultural awareness,” Speakers Committee Director Amanda Schmitt said. “We’ve had people from Barack Obama to Stan Lee, and we were so excited to have Jon Lovett come speak about life in Washington D.C. and American culture.”
Dubbed “Washington’s Funniest Celebrity,” Lovett was Obama’s former speechwriter for three years and wrote jokes for the president’s annual White House Correspondents Dinner. Prior to that, he was the chief speechwriter for Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign.
“Politicians are relying on comedy because it’s a way of breaking through to listeners when it’s so hard to get news to people,” Lovett said. “Humor is a way of saying we share the same view of what’s ridiculous or absurd. A laughing response is shorthand for, ‘I understand you.’”
Lovett emphasized the continued influence of the media in politics and how it has evolved.
“One of the things I learned when I first got into D.C. was how much the daily lives of senators was getting the press to cover what they want to talk about,” Lovett said. “For a long time, it was about finding a great pithy phrase for a sound byte. These days, what we share are honest, emotional, sincere expressions of either moments of surprise and moments of unexpected honesty, when the artifice of politics seems to break down.”
Lovett said Hillary Clinton’s widely publicized display of emotion in New Hampshire during her campaign humanized her to the American people.
“It was an honest, raw moment when people got to see a side of her they didn’t see before,” he said. “I think this shows we’re moving in the right direction because it demonstrates how the interests of politicians and ordinary citizens become more aligned.”
Still, Lovett recognizes that solving many of the country’s most pressing issues are hindered by dishonesty in the public and private sectors alike.
“We have serious problems, and we have serious things we need to do, but so much of our culture right now can’t be trusted,” Lovett said. “We’re drowning in partisan rhetoric that’s barely true. It’s dangerous and it affects every facet of our lives. Cynicism is a natural response to the kind of culture we live in.”
Lovett stressed the importance of the younger generation in changing the country’s mindset from cutthroat partisanship to valuing honesty.
“What gives me hope is ‘peopleship’ — a new generation is coming of age,” Lovett said. “The big test you guys are going to face when you leave here is the test of being the generation that fights for a renaissance of integrity, that fights for something true.”
After three years of writing speeches for Obama, Lovett decided to pursue screenwriting. He is a producer on the HBO award-winning series The Newsroom and is the co-creator and head writer of the 2010 NBC sitcom 1600 Penn.
“I left government because I wanted to write about things I cared about outside of the visible spectrum of politics, which is very small. There’s a lot you can’t talk about,” Lovett said. “I wanted to have an impact in a different way and talk about things in a different way.”
Lovett encourages recent graduates to consider jobs on the Hill.
“I think it’s great so many young people go into government,” Lovett said. “It’s a time in which you’re naturally optimistic and that’s a great energy in our government. In a way, we depend on every generation of young people to come into government and bring in a fresh perspective.”

For many college students, finals week is synonymous with countless hours of studying, sleepless nights and unhealthy eating patterns. What caffeinated beverages and junk food lack in nutritional value, they make up for in quick jolts of energy. It can be difficult to prioritize eating well through this particularly stressful period of the semester. Through personal experience, I have discovered a few simple tips and techniques to stay healthy amid the stress. Making minor yet mindful changes to your routine will improve your overall mood and energy level, helping you feel prepared and confident on exam day.
A healthy alternative · Tomato and chickpea salad with yogurt dressing is a perfect example of a substantial salad that can provide vegetables and lean proteins as an alternative to fatty foods while facing off with an exam. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
 
Start with a solid breakfast
Skipping the first meal of the day is one of the worst decisions a college student can make during finals week. Eating a hearty, well-balanced breakfast not only gives you the energy to start the morning off right, but also helps reduce unnecessary snacking throughout the day. Protein-rich foods such as eggs and Greek yogurt are reliable and versatile options. With minimal effort, both of these staple ingredients can be quickly transformed into a satisfying meal. If you are in the mood for something sweet, mix yogurt with nut butter, fresh fruit and a sprinkle of muesli or granola. I often pack this breakfast in a jar in the evenings, allowing me to throw it in my bag when I leave for class.
Though even novice cooks can scramble eggs, mixing in a handful of diced vegetables, leafy greens and grated cheese instantly transforms the old standard. These ingredients not only add fresh flavor and color to the scramble, but they also increase its volume, making you feel more satisfied.
Look for substantial salads
Most college students indulge in fatty foods during times of stress, but a hefty salad consisting of grains, vegetables and lean proteins can be surprisingly satisfying. Even though these substantial salads require a few different ingredients, they are quite simple to prepare given a well-stocked refrigerator. To keep each bite interesting, it is important to maintain a balance of flavors and textures. Raw greens and vegetables serve as the base, while sliced avocado and a fried egg provide richness, and garnishes such as toasted nuts and dried fruit add crunch.
There really is no right way to assemble a salad; feel free to get creative and tweak the flavors according to your tastes. For inspiration, look no further than my tomato and chickpea salad with yogurt dressing. The cool yogurt dressing perfectly complements the peppery arugula and toasted pine nuts. A fried egg, with its crisp, lacy edges and signature runny yolk, binds the dish together into a cohesive whole.
 
Snack with discretion
While snacking helps students persevere through arduous study sessions, overeating out of boredom can quickly become a dangerous habit. Dividing snacks into individual portions is an easy yet impactful way to control the amount you consume. Rather than munch on trail mix or pretzels directly from the bag, distribute single servings into separate containers. Doing so helps you visualize exactly how much you snack on in a given day, and understand appropriate portion sizes. If you have an insatiable sweet tooth, try creating a rewards system for chocolatey treats. Your productivity may increase knowing that a piece of dark chocolate is waiting for you after you finish writing a page of your research paper. Though these recommendations are useful to keep in mind, avoiding impulsive snacking entirely is the ideal solution. To reset your focus during a long night of studying, take a short walk around campus or read an article from a favorite magazine. Ultimately, you will feel proud of yourself for resisting the urge to eat out of stress.
Tomato and Chickpea Salad with Yogurt Dressing 
• 1 15 oz. can of cooked chickpeas
• 1 cup of cherry tomatoes, sliced crosswise
• ½ cup of cucumber slices (from about 2 medium cucumbers)
• ½ avocado, cubed
• 2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted
• 2 cups arugula
• ¼ cup plain yogurt
• 2 teaspoons olive oil
• 1 teaspoon lemon juice
• 2 large eggs
• Salt and pepper, to taste
Total: 15 min. Serves 2.
1. Rinse and drain the chickpeas and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. In a medium bowl, mix together tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, chickpeas and pine nuts. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
2. To make the dressing, combine yogurt, olive oil and lemon juice in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the chickpea mixture in tablespoons, mixing just until the chickpea mixture is coated. Set aside.
3. Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Spray with non-stick cooking spray or coat with olive oil. Once the oil is hot, crack the eggs into the pan, season with salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the edges are browned and crisp but the yolk is runny. To serve, place one cup of arugula on each plate. Divide the chickpea mixture evenly between the two plates and top with the fried egg.

Just in time for soft snowflake-filled mornings and afternoons filled with rich hot chocolate comes She & Him’s new album Classics, which is released on Dec. 5. This record stars the “She” counterpart, Zooey Deschanel, voice accompanied by M. Ward’s “Him.” A smooth, sweet and very old-school album, Classics is reminiscent of the times in which some of the album cuts were originally produced.

Ward’s smooth melodies on a tracklist featuring a series of lesser-known hits spanning generations of iconic singers including renditions of Frank Sinatra’s “Stars Fell on Alabama” and Carole King’s “Oh Not My Baby.” – Photo courtesy of She & Him
The album opens with a beautiful cover of Frank Sinatra’s “Stars Fell On Alabama.” The band reminds listeners of the smooth jazz syndicated sound that accompanies most of Norah Jones best work. It’s easy to see why they chose this smile inducing song as their album opener. “Stars Fell On Alabama,” sets the tone for the whole album and alerts listeners to its potential to becoming an unforgettable holiday record. Christmas favorites are not among the songs recorded, but Classics pulls from every generation and will surely put a smile on any relative’s face as they remember the hits of their younger years.
The next cut, “Oh Not My Baby,” a Carole King original, showcases Zooey Deschanel’s unique voice. Though not as classic as King’s, Deschanel’s voice is able to add a haunting beauty to the old pop favorite. This song was meant to accompany holiday cocktail parties or just those Mad Men-esque evenings where a little beauty is necessary.
The whole album is classy and decadent, oozing over the sides like a double-rich chocolate cake. The third song on the album, “It’s Not For Me to Say,” originally by Johnny Mathis, only emphasizes this point. A sleepy number that makes one think of satin dressing gowns and looking at a tired Las Vegas circa 1973 at 4 a.m.,  the song captures the mood that Mathis was trying to create while adding their own almost-too-sweet layer of frosting on top.
Though the album could be too much, too overdone or just too sappy to listen to, She & Him offers enough range and versatility, and their band enough innovative phrasing, that Classics maintains its classic quality rather than falling into the pit of being dated. That said, the album does retain a sort of campy spirit that would make it a perfect gift for anyone who would frequent Urban Outfitters or pair his ironic moustaches with suspenders. In other words, with this album, She & Him have created an almost-not-quite pretentious, retro-chic, vintage-tinged sound that should be queasiness inducing and yet, for some reason, isn’t in the slightest.
The fourth cut on the album, “Stay Awhile,” could rouse a two-step in just about anyone. Though this album has already marked a space on most holiday morning playlists, this particular song carries it over to old school cocktail parties as well as lonely drives through the country. A fun dance number like this is reminiscent of soundtracks to indie movies set in the heartland or the background music of a holiday episode of The Office.
This strange, hip, slightly cheesy sound is exactly what She & Him are going for. In their past holiday album, they were able to make holiday favorites more approachable for Generation X-ers and millennials who had sworn off anything mainstream.  Classics does the same thing and takes it one step further. She & Him don’t have to do any extra work to make old school vintage Americana songs approachable for their hip audience, but their updates do make their sound accessible for more mainstream listeners who would have steered clear of them in other circumstances.
She & Him purposely did not create a holiday album. However, intentionally or not, Classics will become the perfect accompaniment to a holiday season spent with friends, or family. She & Him bring a home staple that could be a present for mom or just a way to calm down in traffic during the Winter morning commute. The album is safe and comforting like a hug or a favorite pair of socks, and like both, it won’t go out of style anytime soon.
Classics, is available for download on iTunes and Spotify. Let Deschanel and Ward dot the “i’s” on the Christmas cards and make cooking the holiday ham, just a little sweeter. An all-around warm and fuzzy collection of old hits with a new urban spin, Classics, is a must for this holiday season.

In Before I Disappear, Shawn Christensen’s first feature film, the director proves himself as a new cinematic voice that is unique, unafraid and assured. Here, he juggles directing, screenwriting, acting, producing and song-writing duties. As if that wasn’t enough, Christensen must also deal with a lot of built-in expectation, as the movie is an expansion of his short film “Curfew,” which won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 2012. Where “Curfew” is an exercise in concise and powerful short-form storytelling, Before I Disappear is a wild and bizarre journey that adds worthy substance to the story and makes wonderful use of its longer running time.
Oh, what a night · Expanded from director Shawn Christensen’s short film “Curfew,” Before I Disappear follows troubled protagonist Richie (Christensen) and his niece Sophia (Fatima Ptacek) as they go on a whirlwind, sometimes surreal adventure over the course of a single night. – Photo courtesy of IFC Films
As Before I Disappear begins, Richie (Shawn Christensen) is in the process of killing himself when the phone rings. It is his sister, Maggie (Emmy Rossum), with whom Richie hasn’t spoken in years. She is in a bind (the likes of which won’t be spoiled here) and needs Richie to look after her daughter, Sophia (Fatima Ptacek). Richie agrees, bandaging his wrists, popping some meds and setting out into New York. Over the course of a single night, Richie takes Sophia on a mind-bending trip, often straying from his well-intentioned plans. It is unapologetically fun to watch and resonates with a real emotional core.
The film explores the darkness of its characters, yet finds a way to still be hysterically funny. This is important because when these people are hit with increasing degrees of conflict, it would be easy to succumb to that despair. Christensen will not allow that to happen.
“In these past three years, I’ve had some low points, and I felt like making films that had some sort of life-affirming nature to them inside a darker context I guess, just because of where my head was,” Christensen said.
The emotional connectivity that Christensen feels to his material is evident in every moment of the film. He effortlessly guides the audience between comedy and tragedy, tension and release, life and dream.
The surreal plays a major part in Before I Disappear, with Christensen orchestrating some of the more cinematically jubilant moments in any film in recent memory, the kind of visuals that beg to be watched again and again. A few sequences (including an impromptu choreographed dance in a blowing alley and a mask party featuring a bow-and-arrow) seem to benefit from Richie’s unfortunate circumstances.
“In a movie like this where a guy has lost some blood and he’s on some meds and he’s confused, and he’s disoriented, it’s a great way to use some cinematic license to play with that,” Christensen said.
It is the vision, theme and atmosphere that is the stamp of a filmmaker, and Christensen cements himself among the best when it comes to creating a consistent and inviting mood.
The music is also stunning throughout. Christensen had grandiose ideas that were quickly shunned by his producers due to the film’s low budget and the high royalty costs of the songs. His pricey choices included David Bowie and The Animals’ hit “House of the Rising Sun,” for starters. Knowing that these songs would elevate the film to new heights, Christensen went the route less traveled.
“I decided to go to the managers of these bands and say, ‘This is how I want to use your music, I love your music, this is how it inspired me and saved my life when I was growing up, and I’d love to use them in the film.’ I sent them a clip of it, and they said sure, and they said sure for very, very, very little money,” Christensen said.
Though Christensen himself is a leading man with bravado, carrying a film that weaves in and out of reality with an effortless grace, the ensemble cast is also  amazing. Ron Perlman, Emmy Rossum and Paul Wesley (also one of the film’s producers) bring their absolute all in their supporting roles, filling each scene with incredible humor and tension, letting their characters breathe and exist within this hyper-reality. Christensen’s co-star, young Fatima Ptacek reprising her role as Sophia from the short film, is a knockout. Sophia is a bit conceited, condescending and arrogant, but Ptacek has an uncanny ability to allow the child to come through. It is a stunning performance, and Christensen says Ptacek’s maturity as a person affects her maturity as an actress.
“She is way ahead of her time and age,” he said. “The types of movies she watches at her age are the types of things I didn’t start watching until I came to high school or college.”
Christensen and Ptacek’s performances provide the emotional heartbeat, their chemistry palpable, as they propel the story with their banter and infectious likability.
When asked what he plans on doing next, Christensen said he is going to be sticking around the independent scene for a while, buying back a script he wrote that he sold to Fox a few years ago called Sidney Hall. He is candid about this expectations, though.
“I don’t want to do an independent movie for that little money that I did Before I Disappear, but I also want to tell a good story. If that happens at the studios fine, but I think this project, Sidney Hall, is a little more for independent and art house cinemas,” he said.
Independent budgets might be a roadblock toward the grand vision that Christensen is working toward, but his passion is clear.
“I love movies, I love being entertained, so I don’t think it’s a problem for me to find ways to entertain people within the independent form,” he said.
There is no doubt that Christensen can utilize the independent system and create a singular, must-see vision; those who watch Before I Disappear will be convinced. If he is moving toward the studio system and their seemingly endless resources, then Hollywood will be better for it, because it should be their privilege to welcome a true and proven talent into their ranks just as he begins to harness the recognition he deserves.
Before I Disappear will be released in Los Angeles on Dec. 5 and is also available on iTunes and VOD.

As the holidays jingle in, the newest color of the season seems to be Apple (RED). In an unprecedented two-week campaign that began Nov. 24, tech giant Apple Inc. will be donating a portion of its holiday sales from retail and online stores to (PRODUCT) RED, a licensed brand with a mission to rid the world of HIV/AIDS in Africa by engaging the private sector. Though raising funds for a cause seems exclusively beneficial, the ethics and efficacy of this so-called “conscience consumerism” concept should raise questions.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
 
Founded in 2006 by activist Bobby Shriver and U2 lead singer Bono, private company (RED) has partnered with a slew of companies that include Nike, American Express, Armani, Beats Electronics and Starbucks. (RED) will donate a percentage of the funds it receives from partner brands to the Global Fund. In exchange, these partner brands benefit from the opportunity to increase revenue through the (RED) license.
Apple seems to be cashing in on the holiday shopping frenzy with (RED). On Black Friday, all U.S. Apple stores and online counterparts offered customers buying select products a special edition (RED) gift card. Yesterday, for World AIDS Day, Apple donated a portion of all in-store and online purchase to the cause. The campaign also includes 25 partnering app-makers, from the teams behind Angry Birds, Toca Boca and more, which will donate all proceeds from purchases of their apps or in-app upgrades to (RED).
Though it’s a case of ethical consumerism, it also seems to be a show of slacktivism, a term used to describe an act of showing support for a cause to make people feel morally superior with minimal personal effort. Campaigns like this beg the question of why a retail middleman between the charity and the donor is needed in the first place.
In fact, the campaign seems like more of an effort to associate private corporations with charitable causes for the sake of image rather than pure philanthropy. After all, each company will return a share of the profits from the sale of (RED) products — only in exchange for an opportunity to increase their own revenue and profits by attracting more social-conscious consumers. There’s also a lack of transparency when it comes to the proportion of profits from (RED) products donated to the Global Fund after (RED) receives funds from companies like Apple.
Not to mention, according to news site Philanthropy Action, participants such as Gap, Motorola and Apple have invested $100 million in (RED) advertising but have only raised about $18 million for the Global Fund. The disproportionate ratio between the marketing outlay and funds raised is alarming. In her piece “Costly Red Campaign Reaps Meager $18 Million,” AdvertisingAge writer Mya Frazier mused, “[Is] the rise of philanthropic fashionistas decked out in Red T-shirts and iPods really the best way to save a child dying of AIDS in Africa?” Other voices hit the nail on the head as well. Buylesscrap.org is a site that encourages people to give directly to the Global Fund, with the rallying cry, “Shopping is not a solution. Buy less. Give more.”
Only time will tell if this edgy, innovative campaign will inspire consumers to become better citizens or serve as just another excuse to feel good about themselves. In theory, it might sound appealing, but the campaign could easily shift into the realm of cause branding instead of corporate social responsibility.

Dear Valerie
Thank you for your interest in (RED)’s efforts to raise money and awareness for the AIDS fight and particularly this year’s World AIDS Day campaign. There are a couple of inaccuracies that I would like to address:
I think it’s important first to clarify the reason for (RED)’s existence. It was established in 2006 to drive a sustainable flow of corporate dollars to the Global Fund. As you may know, the Fund was established in 2002 as the world’s ‘war chest’ to fight three preventable and treatable diseases – AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. From day one, its charter was to be a public-private partnership, with funding coming from both governments and the private sector. 
In its first four years of operation, while it received great support from the public sector, the Fund had managed to get only $5 million from the corporate sector. If this dynamic didn’t change, there was a risk that government support for the Fund might diminish. Bono and Bobby Shriver created (RED) to solve this problem. In its eight years of existence, (RED) has generated over $275 million for the Global Fund’s fight against AIDS, every single penny of which has gone to work on the ground. There is no overhead removed by either (RED) or the Global Fund. 
The article you cite about marketing dollar imbalance vs donations to the Fund actually originated in an erroneous piece from Ad Age in 2007. Both the figures cited and the implication that (RED) was spending millions of dollars in marketing is wrong.
Part of (RED)’s job is to convince our partners to use some of their existing marketing budgets to sell more (RED) products and keep awareness levels high about a pandemic which has killed 39 million people to date – unnecessarily dead from a preventable, treatable disease. 
We’re proud that, according to the latest Global Fund reports, (RED) money has supported HIV/AIDS grants that have impacted the lives of 55 million people. We’re
grateful to our partners for choosing to play an active role in the AIDS fight, generating millions of dollars for the Global Fund annually. 
We’re happy to talk about (RED) and the AIDS fight anytime if you’d like to get in touch. 
Sincerely, 
Sheila Roche
Head of Communications, (RED)

Yesterday, while most companies aggressively marketed Cyber Monday deals, tech giant Apple rang in the holiday season with a new initiative that promises to make its customers inspi(RED).
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
 
The corporation launched its two-week campaign PRODUCT (RED) on Nov. 24, pledging to donate a portion of all its in-store and online purchases on certain days, as well as all proceeds from purchases of the 25 participating apps, to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
Such initiatives are laudable in that they not only bring awareness to serious issues in an innovative way, but they also allow the average consumer to make a difference and deviate from the usual slacktivism that has become all too popular, especially among social media users.
(RED), which was launched in 2006 by U2 lead singer Bono and activist Bobby Shriver, aims to utilize the private sector to raise both awareness and funds for eliminating HIV/AIDS. Over the years, the organization has raised more than $250 million.
Though Apple’s initiative is new, its involvement with (RED) is not. In fact, of the $275 million raised by (RED), Apple has contributed more than $75 million — 27.3 percent of total campaign funds raised.
And such funds truly make an impact. The 650 children born each day with HIV have an increased mortality rate if they fail to receive the necessary treatments that cost approximately 40 cents a day. With more than 55 million people receiving treatment from the Global Fund, (RED)’s efforts clearly make a tangible difference.
(RED) has received its fair share of criticism. Some say that the campaign aims to provide false gratification to major companies and their consumers. Though critics are free to question the genuine compassion of the corporations collaborating with (RED), they can’t argue with the numbers. Whether for the good of the cause or for sheer good publicity, (RED) has successfully utilized its partnerships with dozens of corporations — including The Coca-Cola Company and Starbucks — to raise millions of dollars that go directly to AIDS treatment programs. The effort has the potential to compel even more companies to join the (RED) bandwagon.
“This campaign is certainly something that could cause other companies to step up,” (RED) CEO Deborah Dugan told USA Today. “And we need to keep the heat on (HIV/AIDS) or we’ll slip back to where we were.”
It goes without saying that you don’t have to buy a (RED) product to care about this issue — there are other ways to make a meaningful impact at the individual level, from personal donations to volunteer service. But just as such acts are laudable, so too are the small opportunities that consumers can take to make a difference — actions that are more tangible than Facebook likes or videos of people dumping ice water on their heads. Initiatives like Apple’s (RED) campaign give ordinary people the opportunity to shake their slacktivist tendencies and put their money where their mouths are — all through a simple purchase of products they would likely purchase regardless.
With the season of giving upon us, initiatives like Apple’s (RED) campaign remind us that even small acts of giving can make a huge difference.

In the words of head coach Jovan Vavic, “It’s a new season,” for the USC men’s water polo team.
The No. 3 Trojans’ (23-6) rollercoaster of a regular season is over, and their NCAA Tournament run got underway with a dominant 19-4 win over No. 6 Whittier in a play-in game  last Saturday.
Geni from the pool · Senior driver Kostas Genidounias opened the scoring on Saturday, in the process becoming USC’s career leader in goals. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
USC senior driver Kostas Genidounias opened the scoring, becoming the school’s all-time leading scorer with 255 goals. Vavic felt it was fitting that Genidounias reached the mark in his final home game at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
“That’s a very special moment,” Vavic said. “His mom and dad and sister were there. Kostas is such an unselfish player. The fact that he became the leading scorer and is still unselfish … I mean, he could have scored another 70 goals on top of what he scored in those four years if he was a selfish player.”
The Poets (23-13) evened the match at one before the Trojans went on a five-goal surge, including two consecutive strikes from senior driver Rex Butler and another two in a row from freshman utility James Walters. Whittier again cut the lead with a goal of their own, but USC scores from senior driver Marc Vonderweidt, redshirt sophomore driver Luke Felton and senior two-meter Max Hurst-Mendoza extended the Trojans’ lead to 9-2 by halftime.
Four USC players scored in the third quarter to increase the lead to 15-5 entering the final frame. But the Trojans were not finished just yet. In the fourth quarter, Vonderweidt and Walters earned hat tricks, while freshman driver Lazar Pasuljevic became the 12th USC player to score.
In addition to Genidounias, two other Trojans moved up in the record books on Saturday. Butler’s two goals placed him at No. 25 on USC’s all-time career scoring list with 114. With five saves against the Poets, freshman goalie McQuin Baron advanced to second place on USC’s single-season save list with 264. Baron is now five saves away from passing Andrew Tinseth’s 1993 record.
Vavic knows this win was significant for the Trojans, not just to stay alive in the NCAA Tournament, but also to build confidence after placing in fourth at the MPSF Tournament.
“We definitely feel better about ourselves now,” Vavic said. “It’s a new season. We have two games left, and we are still alive. Our goal back in September was to make it to the NCAA, and we did it. We’re focused on getting the job done in San Diego.”
Over the course of the season it seemed that USC played well when it needed to, but often struggled in other situations. The team proved itself as a contender for its seventh straight national title by winning the SoCal Tournament, but lost crucial regular season matches to UCLA and Stanford. Now that every game is win or go home, Vavic believes the Trojans are in prime position for success.
“I definitely mentioned that [to the team] about the season,” Vavic said. “We lost in the semifinals of the MPSF Tournament which was not a must-win for us. The game that was a must-win was [UC] Irvine and that was the game we prepared. So that’s a good sign, a very good sign.”
With this victory, the Trojans are off to La Jolla, California, where UC San Diego will host the NCAA Tournament semifinals and finals. The Trojans are set to play No. 2 Stanford (25-3) Saturday at 3:10 p.m. USC played the Cardinal twice this season, with the first meeting resulting in a last-second road loss. The two teams met again in the conference tournament in a defensive battle; that game also went to the Cardinal, 7-4. Nonetheless, Vavic believes that this history does not play any role in this game.
“In 2012 our [women’s] team went to the NCAA and we were ranked No. 6 and played Stanford and UCLA,” Vavic said. “We hadn’t beaten them once. In the semifinals of that tournament, we crushed UCLA. It was not even close. It’s a new season. The playoffs are a new opportunity. We have two weeks to prepare. What really happened in those last two games doesn’t matter.”
If the Trojans are victorious, they will play in their 10th straight national championship game and get a shot at their seventh straight title on Sunday at 3:10 p.m.

It’s a crisp fall morning in Southern Californian suburbia, the kind where leaving the warmth of home makes my breath create wispy streams of condensation that trail me as I run to the end of our driveway, where the day’s copy of the Los Angeles Times sat in the same spot every morning for almost 10 years.
To anyone else, this unremarkable lump of gray paper contained the day’s news: It described the previous day’s events and foreshadowed what was to come. To an 8-year-old kid who ripped open that cellophane cover or pulled off the plastic tie and rifled through to section C (and later, section D), it was entering into another world: It was a matter of how the Lakers won or lost, of whether or not Wilton Guerrero was the rookie that would turn the tides of the Dodgers’ franchise. What did J.A. Adande, Bill Plaschke think? Most importantly, knowing what was happening in sports was the way an 8 year old who spoke mostly English could communicate with a father who spoke exclusively Korean. In other words, to me, that unremarkable lump of gray paper meant the world.
In my younger years and through adolescence, my father couldn’t communicate very complex concepts to me due to my limited grasp of the Korean language. My understanding of my father was limited to an emotional binary: when he was upset (at which point I was generally in fear) and when he wasn’t upset, which was the default setting. The only time I could get to know my father on more than a surface level was in his evaluation of sports events.
I would decipher these happenings and player performances through hard statistics, obsessing over the analysis of Mark Heisler and poring over the NBA statistical leader boards and box scores, and my father would point things out purely from his observations. At the zenith of Michael Jordan’s powers, my father was the one pointing out the play of Scottie Pippen and how the lanky Arkansas native was guarding the passing lanes and limiting the cutting ability of opposing players.
“Pippen is a gentleman, a real man,” my father would tell me in Korean. “He does a lot of the hard work, and Michael Jordan gets most of the glory, but Pippen is what a man should be.”
And such were the lessons from my father. Pippen was impressive on the stat sheet, but I would argue my face blue about Michael Jordan’s vast statistical, and thus actual, superiority. There was something particular about my father’s observation, though, that transcended simple statistical analysis. It takes keen spectatorship to point out how Pippen would hand-check a man in the post precisely as the wing dumped the ball off, like a defensive back contesting a quarterback’s pass, leading to an easy steal.
In sports, scoreboards tell a simple story, but it takes experiencing the visual spectacle to appreciate its beauty. The only way to relive that spectacle is through video, radio or the written word. “The Shot.” “The Flu Game.” The words invoke indelible images, things that can’t be caught in the box score. Sharing these things with my father was a point of emotional connection with him that simply could not be matched. Reading the L.A. Times brought back the images I had seen on television the night prior but added a richness and depth that I wouldn’t be able to put in my own words — at least not yet. But my father only needed to bring up a player’s name or a single, pithy observation about Derek Fisher getting torched by younger point guards for us to connect on a level that transcended a language barrier. Immediately, father and son track on the same narrative, the archetypal story of a man struggling with age.
I wanted to write about sports because it does this: It connects people of different languages and different backgrounds. It spurs discussion, helps people relive the thrill of victory or stokes outrage after a loss. Most importantly, it cemented a bond between a father and son where otherwise that bond could not have existed. It helped a man facing a language barrier teach his son values and principles to carry for a lifetime by describing a single player.
The barbershop-style debates would eventually come with time, as my father and I developed a relationship that became deeper and more richly colored still through a mutual affinity for sport. The language barrier between my father and me became less pronounced through the years as my Korean improved, but when we need to illustrate complex concepts, our conversation always turned to sports analogies. My wish to write about sports at the Daily Trojan stemmed from a desire to put the visual spectacle in words so that we could forge bonds that transcend them. I hope I have been successful in doing so. It has been an honor to serve as your eyes and ears.

If a USC football team can’t beat both, it must beat at least one of USC’s longtime rivals for its season to be considered a success in the eyes of some Trojan fans.
Bouncing back · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler responded to a lackluster performance against UCLA with an excellent effort against the Irish. Kessler threw for 372 yards and six touchdowns on Saturday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Though USC looked outmatched against crosstown foe UCLA in a 38-20 loss last week, the Trojans redeemed themselves to some degree with a dominating 49-14 victory over Notre Dame on Saturday. The highs and lows of the last two games are indicative of both the first season under head coach Steve Sarkisian and the careers of the seniors who played in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the final time.
“I’m happy for this [senior] class,” Sarkisian said. “Their last game in the Coliseum is something they’re obviously going to remember for a lifetime.”
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler threw six touchdowns to five different receivers, and the Trojan defense held a Fighting Irish offense that was previously averaging about 35 points per game to only two touchdowns.
“All three phases were just tremendous,” Sarkisian said.
The Trojans started the game on a 35-0 run. After punting on their first possession, the Trojans found the endzone on their next five. Kessler finished the day 32-40 with 372 yards and no interceptions. He at one point completed 16 passes in a row and set his career record for completions.
Kessler said the team planned on running a particularly up-tempo style and that they executed the game plan excellently.
“Today, it was obvious how tough it was for them to get lined up against us,” Kessler said of the fast pace. “It really played to our advantage.”
Notre Dame did not advance the ball into USC territory until the second quarter. The Irish did not score until the 4:11 mark in the second half, after backup quarterback Malik Zaire had replaced starter Everett Golson.
Golson finished the day 7-18 with 75 yards and one interception in the air. The dual-threat signal caller came into the game with 291 rushing yards on the season but left the game with a net -14 yards rushing after being sacked three times. The Trojans also forced one Golson fumble and finished the day with two caused turnovers.
Senior linebacker Hayes Pullard said the key was for the linebackers to get pressure on Golson, something they didn’t do the week before against UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley.
“We learned from last week, us linebackers weren’t going,” Pullard said. “We had to get after it and help our D-line. We prepared all week. [Defensive coordinator Justin] Wilcox had a great plan for us.”
Trojan fans also got to see a backup in at quarterback for USC but under slightly different circumstances. Redshirt freshman Max Browne relieved Kessler with about 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter but did not record a passing attempt. On the Trojans’ final drive, senior Anthony Neyer, the fifth quarterback on USC’s depth chart, subbed into the game as the signal caller. He also did not record a passing attempt but did rush for five yards on two attempts.
“It was awesome,” Neyer said. “It was such a blessing to be able to come into this Saturday against Notre Dame in my last game in the Coliseum and see everybody do so well.”
At the final home game in the careers of the 12 seniors on the roster, the Trojans celebrated Senior Day by honoring each senior player before the game. The 12 seniors were announced individually coming out of the tunnel before the game and were met by family at midfield.
The seniors honored included Neyer, Pullard, tight end/defensive end Teddy Baker, safety Gerald Bowman, center Giovanni Di Poalo, offensive tackle Nathan Guertler, kicker Andre Heidari, cornerback Josh Shaw, linebacker J.R. Tavai, tight end Randall Telfer, guard Aundrey Walker and tight end Chris Willson.
Bowman recorded an interception and seven tackles, Pullard recorded three tackles — including one for a loss and a fumble recovery — Shaw recorded a tackle and Telfer caught Kessler’s sixth touchdown pass.
The win concludes a tumultuous first regular season for Sarkisian as USC’s head coach. The Trojans were in contention for the Pac-12 South championship until losing to UCLA in their final conference game. In addition to a big defeat against UCLA, the Trojans lost decisively out of conference to an unranked Boston College team then lost on the final drive against both Arizona State and Utah.
Sarkisian said the Arizona State loss stings particularly strongly, as the Sun Devils won the game on a miraculous “Hail Mary” pass as time expired, and Trojans would have made the Pac-12 title game if they had successfully defended that one play (with all else being equal over the season).
“Those are some gut-wrenching losses,” Sarkisian said, looking back on the regular season. “It’s my job to figure that out so that doesn’t happen again.”
One more win in their bowl game will leave the Trojans just short of 10 wins on the season, but Sarkisian said he would nonetheless be proud to see the 8-4 Trojans finish with nine wins. Though he said he was looking forward to next year, saying, the focus was on finishing off the season with a bowl win.
“I’m proud of the way we played,” Sarkisian said. “I think it gives us a chance to head into bowl prep with a lot of confidence.”
Quick Hits
Kessler was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against Notre Dame. It is the third time he has won the award this season. Arizona linebacker Scooby Wright III won the conference’s Defensive Player of the Week Award, and Utah punter Tom Hackett received the Special Teams Player of the Week Award.
Redshirt junior linebacker Charles Burks and redshirt sophomore wide receiver Robby Kolanz received honorable mention All-Pac-12 Academic honors.
It remains unclear which bowl game the Trojans will attend. This season, the Pac-12 is affiliated with the Alamo Bowl, National University Holiday Bowl, Foster Farms Bowl, Hyundai Sun Bowl, Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl and Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl. Based on the current conference standings, USC will likely land in either the Holiday or Las Vegas Bowl. The Trojans defeated Fresno State 45-20 in last season’s Las Vegas Bowl.
Sarkisian said USC will resume practice on Friday.

It’s been a few years since USC has defeated Notre Dame, so many fans might have forgotten how sweet of a feeling it is to beat the Fighting Irish. Saturday was a reminder: There is nothing quite like winning rivalry games.
The matchup between USC and Notre Dame on Saturday wasn’t just a win, it was a beatdown of epic proportions. The Trojans thoroughly dismantled the Irish. They carved up a young secondary through the air and ran roughshod through the front seven.
Granted, this wasn’t a Notre Dame team at full strength. The combination of academic suspensions and a severe injury bug has decimated the Irish defense. Very few Notre Dame defenders who made it through Saturday’s game unscathed were slated to start back in the spring. While that helps put the win into perspective, it doesn’t dim the happiness of Trojan fans all around the country. That was the perfect way to respond to an emotionally draining defeat at the hands of the Bruins last week.
While the victory was tremendous and allowed coach Steve Sarkisian to forever vanquish his “Seven Win Sark” moniker (back-to-back eight win seasons), it raised a few more questions about the future of the program.  While it’d be easy to say where this offense was against UCLA, it was clear that the Bruins’ defensive talent dwarfed that of what were mostly Notre Dame backups out on the field.
It would have been nearly impossible to play that great against an attacking Bruin defense, but it does make one wonder where the middle screens and quick passes to the tight end and receivers lined up in the slot were last week. Also, where has George Farmer been all year? While the defensive backs for Notre Dame may not be All-Americans, they are still talented athletes. Farmer’s blazing speed made it look as if they were operating in cement.
By all accounts Farmer is the fastest player for the Trojans, which is saying something considering the bevy of former track stars who played on the team this year. If Saturday was any indication, his knack for getting behind defenders deep rivals that of former Trojan receiver Ronald Johnson. If Farmer can emerge next year as a legitimate deep threat, that adds another weapon for the Trojan offense.
Farmer is only one of the many positives going into next year. With a young and improving offensive line, most skill position players returning next year, and a full recruiting class the Trojans have the potential to be one of the best offenses in the country in 2015. This is of course contingent on play calling and coaching, which is where the questions lie.
It’s one thing to put up impressive performances against depleted rosters and less talented teams, which USC did well this year. It’s another to come through against ranked opponents and upper echelon defenses. This was more of a struggle in 2014. Whether the playcalling was conservative due to depth concerns or more of scheme remains to be seen. The 2015 season will offer the answer to that question.
With the exception of Boston College, the 2014 Trojans beat every team they were supposed to. Every team has a trap game so the game against BC can most likely be attributed to that. If USC played Boston College 10 times, they would probably win seven or eight of them.
Against teams playing without a talent gap, the Trojans went 2-3. This is where USC will need to improve in the coming years if they want to compete for national titles. With full recruiting classes, the Trojans might be able to move their talent level back up to elite status across a full roster. This would give them a pronounced edge in terms of talent over most Pac-12 teams with the exception of Oregon, UCLA, and possibly the two Arizona schools. That means wins over teams like Utah and Washington would go back to two or three touchdown victories as opposed to nail biters.
Even when they improve talent and depth, the Trojans will still have four games a year where coaching will have to be the deciding factor between a win or a loss. Notre Dame will be back to normal next year and a force to be reckoned with. As will the Pac-12 teams mentioned above.
This is where the question of coaching comes in. Will Sarkisian be able to replicate offensive performances like the ones against Fresno State, Colorado and Notre Dame against better teams next year? While the offense may not be that dominant, if they could just perform at 80 percent of their potential, the Trojans of the future could be a truly vaunted offensive attack.
The team showed flashes of this in games against Utah, Arizona, and Arizona State in the first half of those battles. With a full roster, will they be able to turn in four quality quarters against elite teams moving forward and avoid playing not to lose?
The same could be said on defense. Will the Trojans get back to recruiting and developing big physical linebackers who can be play makers? With an experienced secondary, will the team blitz more and impose their will on opposing offenses? Can USC be both a dominating defense and an up-tempo offense?
While all this remains to be seen, the Notre Dame game did offer glimpses of what could be a truly great program in the future. Now that sanctions are over, Sarkisian and company can hit the recruiting trail with full force. Regardless of one’s opinion on their coaching prowess, there is no doubt that Sarkisian and his staff are some of most gifted recruiters in the country. Combine that with the fact that SC recruits SC, and the Trojans should be back in the top three of recruiting boards in no time.
This is somewhat comforting as even if the Trojans underperform stupendously in the coming years, the team will be so littered with talent that they could still stumble into 10 victories annually. There was no better symbol to close out the sanctions era than that Notre Dame victory.
The Fighting Irish could barely field a competitive team with a depleted roster due to injuries. They experienced three or four weeks of what USC has gone through for a few years. USC has played Notre Dame close each year with depleted rosters, demonstrating their will to persevere. The window of the NCAA’s attempt to cripple the Trojans for years ended with a resounding rebuke in the form of a 49-14 victory.
It’s nice to know that even when USC isn’t at it’s best they still can win eight to 10 games. One only has to look crosstown to see a team that at it’s best can’t even beat Stanford or Oregon. While it may seem like a while ago, it’s always good to remember that the Trojans at their finest collect Rose Bowls like kids collect candy.
Here’s hoping that 2015 will be the year USC finally gets back to its best.

Where was this team on Nov. 22nd?! How come the way they played against ND was different than against Ucla? That makes no sense; it’s inconsistent.
Good job nonetheless. Good luck at whatever bowl we play in. Fight on!
