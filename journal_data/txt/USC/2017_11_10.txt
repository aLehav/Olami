The USC men’s basketball team routed Cal State Fullerton, doubling their score 84-42 in the team’s season opener at the Galen Center on Friday. 
Touted as one of the most experienced teams in the nation, USC displayed a medley of veteran development and newcomer talent that warranted the preseason top 10 hype.
News broke just before tip-off, when USC announced sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton would be held out indefinitely as a precaution surrounding questions of his eligibility. Melton is likely to be one of two previously unnamed players in the investigation surrounding associate head coach Tony Bland. The other player has not been named; everyone else suited up and played for the Trojans on Friday.
The Trojans did not appear to miss a stride without Melton, who likely would have started. Andy Enfield used his entire 14-man bench tonight and had nine play for more than ten minutes. Five players — junior forward Chimezie Metu, junior forward Boatwright, senior guard Jordan McLaughlin, sophomore guard Jonah Mathews and redshirt sophomore guard Derryck Thornton — scored in double digits. 
Friday’s game exposed no systematic flaws save sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic’s foul trouble, but errors like a missed dunk by senior guard Elijah Stewart, some badly-missed jumpers and a few sloppy possessions proved the Trojans still need time to grease away the rustiness.
“I think we’re much better now than we were at the beginning of training camp 30 practices ago,” head coach Andy Enfield said. 
He appreciated the way his upperclassmen came out and set the tone, playing hard on defense.
At times, USC’s game plan looked familiar but improved. For instance, throughout the past two seasons, McLaughlin has run a high pick-and-roll with Metu. Tonight, however, Metu shared in the ball-handling and even made a pair of 3-pointers.
“The next big part of Chimezie’s game was to improve his range,” Enfield said. “He’s so quick, if he gets out to the 3-point line, he can get by a lot of people.” 
Boatwright said that guarding Metu has become “impossible” since he added perimeter proficiency and ball-handling to his long list of on-court abilities. Metu’s well-rounded game manifested itself in a double-double stat line: 18 points, 10 rebounds and two blocks in only 23 minutes.
Other reminiscent elements of the game included a pair of high-arcing Boatwright 3-pointers and a third from Stewart, plus a handful of McLaughlin floaters including his trademarked buzzer beater, which on Fridaycame at the half to give the Trojans a 42-15 lead. 
But Rakocevic’s foul trouble was all-too-familiar. In 13 minutes, the sophomore amassed five fouls and had to leave the game.
“It’s a concern,” Enfield said of Rakocevic’s fouls. “He needs to learn to play with his feet, not his hands.”
Other new elements of tonight’s game include four USC debuts and staggering depth. After a year of anticipation, Thornton made a quick on-court impact, nailing a 3-pointer on his first shot attempt. He looked explosive throughout his 11-point performance. He did commit three turnovers, but his teammates are still adjusting to his temp0, which is different than McLaughlin’s.
“Derryck is really fast,” Metu said. “When he’s in the game, we’re playing more in transition. [McLaughlin] is fast, too, but he’s more surgical.” 
Freshman Jordan Usher played 15 minutes in his debut but failed to score, as did Chuck O’Bannon, Jr. who played nine minutes. Victor Uyaelunmo debuted with less than five minutes left in the game, scoring 4 points from the free throw line.

On a typical weekday afternoon, students gather at USC Village. Some sit in the piazza under umbrella-topped tables, others pass through to get to their residence hall, Trader Joe’s or Target. But how many are actually purchasing food from the shops?
Since its opening this fall, the highly anticipated USC Village has provided students with a variety of new dining options. Conveniently sandwiched between a bevy of student housing and campus, the $700-million complex has given room to new establishments such as CAVA, Sunlife Organics, The Baked Bear and Starbucks. 
On the surface, USC Village seems to fit all students’ needs — new dining options, residence halls and stores — except for one road-bump: how its food can be purchased. Currently, restaurants at USC Village don’t accept dining and discretionary dollars from USC students, a strict limitation for those who want to purchase food through their dining plan or earned discretionary dollars.
Even before the same time the retail-residential complex opened its doors, complaints and commentary arose deriding the University’s steps toward gentrifying the surrounding area of  South Los Angeles, USC Village being the most glaringly obvious example. It is an uneasy parallel, then, that USC Village also seems to be a commercial enterprise set apart from the University’s students, themselves, along with local residents. 
It feels like a contradiction, in the simplest of ways, that students still cannot use the currency designated as an inherent part of living and working on campus to purchase food from establishments in a new part of USC now embraced as part of its campus. This, in itself, is a pitfall and limitation that deeply affects USC’s student community. It’s also an example of a concerning trend of shortsightedness University administrators have followed in their planning and envisioning of what USC Village was meant to be for their students and surrounding community.
Although USC Village is now considered an expansion of campus, with regulated hours, gates and connecting crosswalks to the original campus, it still stands a peripheral aspect of campus in many ways. Many were misled that all shops would be open simultaneously by August, with no specification as to what “Fall 2017” meant. As of now, only 15 of the 27 shops are open for business. And of 15 possible restaurants, only five are currently operating: CAVA, Sunlife Organics, Greenleaf Gourmet Chopshop, The Baked Bear and Starbucks.
These options are not only limiting, but have also become indicative of the unaffordability of USC Village’s establishments. Take Sunlife Organics for example. On average, the cost of a smoothie or bowl is between $7 and $10. But there are items that are substantially out of budget for many students. The most expensive fruit bowl, “The Samurai Bowl,” costs a whopping $16.95, and the most expensive shake, “The Billion Dollar Meal,” costs almost $28 — not including taxes. 
There are myriad dining options in and around the USC campus that are inexpensive, and it would be easy to take a walk down Figueroa Street and stop by McDonalds, Subway, Jack in the Box or any of the fast food locations. These options, for college students, may seem more appealing than an $11 salad at Cava. 
But even relatively more expensive, non-fast food options at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center such as Lemonade or Verde, which might offer similar dining experiences as restaurants at USC Village, may still end up drawing more students simply because they accept dining or discretionary dollars. 
Ultimately, it’s the University’s prerogative as to how they want to shape USC Village. And it would seem harsh to complain about more dining options and shops around campus as well as more space for students to spread out and relax. But this is less about having these options and more about what the options represent in terms of how the University views USC Village, which cost $700 million to build.
At a school where roughly two-thirds of students are on need-based financial aid, it is shortsighted to not have inexpensive options at USC Village, or to at least allow students to use their dining or discretionary dollars. It seems nonsensical that, if USC Village is indeed part of the USC campus, that vendors in the Village don’t let students spend credit that they either already paid for or earned like they can at vendors on campus.
Based on the restaurants and stores already opened and those that will be open, it seems like the University wants USC Village to be upscale, to cater to students who can afford higher-end options. This is not representative of the economically diverse student population, which includes many well-off students, but also has plenty of others who live paycheck-to-paycheck and could not justify spending $7 on a smoothie. 
It’s too late to change the vendors at this point. But the least USC can do is allow students to use dining or discretionary dollars so that everyone — regardless of their economic situation — can enjoy the full options provided at USC Village, which, in his speech at the Village’s opening in August, President C. L. Max Nikias called “a labor of love for all of us.”
Daily Trojan Fall 2017 Editorial Board
“It feels like a contradiction, in the simplest of ways, that students still cannot use the currency designated as an inherent part of living and working on campus to purchase food from establishments in a new part of USC now embraced as part of its campus.” If I were an editor for DT, that sentence wouldn’t have made it past the desk. : js
Not the best way to ask for a job. :)
Haha good thing I’m not then ey
Once again the anonymous ladies of the DT are demanding more access to food.   It does not cease to amaze me this current fascination with having unlimited access to apparently “free” food while others pay for it.
There are places in this world not so far from this great country were food is a real issue and people are starving.  My son and I work very hard to help these truly needy people get the food they need to be healthy and productive members of God’s extended family.   Maybe for once you could help feed someone who truly needs it and stop only thinking of your own selfish needs.
Ladies, please take a hard look at your bodies and see if this is really what you need (more food).   I’m sure many of you could stand to lose a few pounds.   Likely having a greater access to those salty and fatty foods you crave will only make things worse.  This is no way to treat the body that God gave you.
God Bless and eat less!
What is wrong with you? “God Bless and eat less”?
To lapse into your vernacular, that’s no way to use the voice that God gave you. I won’t make assumption about the socioeconomic status of your household (though I could make an educated guess, “Mom with Greek Son”), but there is literally nothing wrong with expanding students’ access to food on campus. It’s not a zero-sum game – in fact, I’d venture to say that your son might have a lot to gain by chatting over a meal with some of his lower-income peers. 
Take a break from the comment sections, too: having greater access to a platform from which you can externalize your self-loathing and insecurities will only make things worse.
First, you are assuming women wrote this and with the intent of being able to eat more. Second, their eating habits is absolutely none of your business. Please stay to your own body and household instead of trying to restrict other people who have paid for and earned the money that they are trying to use. To make an argument just as presumptive as yours: your son probably wants size 0 women – perhaps he should start being less sloppy and be a decent human being who does not have a sense of entitlement towards women as if they were goods.
Speaking of which, did you read the article? There is no “free” food being talked about. People paid real money for dining dollars and are paid for working on campus in discretionary.
Yes my son is in what many consider the top fraternity at USC.  However, his life is not about partying but instead serving his Maker.   He an others in his fraternity give far more back to those in need than you might imagine.  
Every summer and spring break while you are partying it up at the beach somewhere, my son and many of his friends are working in central America with some of the poorest people on God’s Earth.  People who consider other’s garbage to be food and children often wear discarded plastic bags as clothing.  Death from disease and malnutrition is an everyday occurrence for these people.  Even with all the poverty and death around them, these people believe in the Greatness and that only thru Him will they find Salvation.  
You live in the best country in the World where food is easy to obtain (often you eat too much) and thus you forget where the bounty of food comes from.   Further, you display such an anger toward me, my family and my faith for merely expressing my opinion.    I don’t claim to understand why you hate so much but I will still pray for all.  Even the sinners and disbelievers can be redeemed through Faith and you still have time to change your ways.
My son and I am going to pray for both.
God Bless!
You failed to mention whether or not eating establishments in the original university village accepted dining and discretionary dollars.  My guess is that they didn’t.  Your sense of entitlement is amusing.
Was the original village part of the USC campus? Absolutely not. The establishments in the USC Village are new; not the older business continuing their business. Like every other establishment on campus, they could have easily been required to be a part of the USC system.
Sense of entitlement? People paid for dining dollars the same as a dollar, were paid in discretionary dollars for working on-campus instead of real money and were told they could use it at on-campus establishments. You seem way too keen to push the entitlement narrative. You are inserting it in a story that has nothing to do with it.

I’d hate to do anything to interrupt Donna Brazile’s book’s inevitable disappearance into the ether, but unfortunately, it broaches topics that we — some of us the future Democrats of the American political diaspora, and some of us the future Democratic National Committee leaders of those Democrats — need to get straight.
Now, my disappointment with this bizarre and ridiculous turn of events mostly stems from the ham-handed nature of Brazile’s attempt to make her story fit her title — that is, Hillary Clinton’s Secret Takeover of the DNC. I won’t rehash the details. Feel free to read it. She describes a fundraising agreement between the super PAC Hillary for America and the DNC, which allowed Clinton to bail the DNC out of nearly $10 million of debt in exchange for what was essentially control of her own fundraising. Legal? Yes. Commendable? Depends on what you value. 
I’d prefer to have a functioning DNC, even if it was in such a state that Clinton had to come save it. Brazile’s story spends a while afterward grasping at straws, all in the context of a heartfelt phone call to bright-eyed, innocent progressive hero Bernie Sanders, trying to put her story together to spell corruption. Sadly, it doesn’t. That’s all coming from the woman who was willing to leak debate questions to a presidential campaign (Brazile claims she can’t find those correspondences). Brazile also claims not to have known about financial problems within the DNC that were reported as early as 2012. Her book, including this story, also details the “techno hush” of HFA’s Brooklyn offices — “calm and antiseptic,” she calls it (were they not playing gospel music to candlelit dens?) — along with a host of other dramatic anecdotes. It’s a burning of bridges and grinding of axes. Fine. Clearly, she believes it. I don’t believe she has malicious intentions. But that’s the problem. 
When will we ask ourselves why we sincerely believe it is topical and important to continue  sitting around talking about Hillary Clinton.? Books upon books are coming out on the 2016 election — makes sense, after all — and Clinton published her own memoir, a farewell to the political arena, if you will, a little while ago. But for someone as accomplished as Brazile to run around the country a year later to market another Clinton takedown? Disappointing indeed.
Hillary Clinton is retired. She is appearing on cute, comedic late-night talk shows, speaking at women’s groups and going for walks. She is not a candidate. She is not an officeholder. She is a private citizen. I’m tired of listening to ungrateful and pointless moaning about someone who, for upcoming elections’ sakes, no longer exists. 
We are living in a time when Democrats must celebrate moderate victories — Virginia, New Jersey, New York City — to energize a largely worried and tired base. We still need to find our footing in terms of truly competent, charismatic party leadership. We still need to solve the problem of the single, unified message; we still need to find a way to reach out to lost voters and forgotten demographics. If you support progressivism and the stable first-world state it promises, then get over it: The DNC is what you’ve got. The Democrats are it. So, to all of those who would rather moan about Clinton and the host of other has-been Democrats, to all of those who would rather cannibalize the party to make some point about your own inability to stomach the political reality, to those who would rather bask in the sour taste of our problems than do the real work to seek the solutions — take a page out of Brazile’s book, say your piece and get out.
I don’t mean to advocate sycophantry, but there’s a reason why the lock-step method wins elections for Republicans. But I get it. We’re reasonable. We’re free-thinking. But look: You either believe in the party and its core values, or you get out, like someone with dignity would. The DNC does not exist to be a halfway home for every ideology left of center. If you don’t like the Democratic message, if you curl your lip at centrism, if realists like Obama and Clinton simply didn’t do it for you, feel free to continue crying and abandoning — and watching your issues remain unheard and unachieved. You need the DNC. It’s a two-way street, though, and I’m not denying that. The Democratic Party has always had its coalitions, and most of the time, it’s been stronger for the inclusion of these groups and others. But the RNC was shortsighted enough to give itself up to its Tea Party ends. The DNC cannot afford to do the same with the ultra-progressives. 
If you want to solve the DNC’s problems, if you want to see it shift strategies and change directions, commit. Don’t whine. Don’t leave a paper trail of its dirty laundry. Commit. You want to change the DNC? You want to revamp the DNC? You want to revitalize the DNC? Commit to the DNC. 
There is one major partisan institution of progressive change in this country. There is only one. It bankrolls almost 50 percent of your national representatives and many more as the ranks get lower. It is the DNC. 
The Democrats need to reunite again. Do not entertain this gossip-mongering and whining and demanding. Get involved locally. Support competent leadership nationally. Take ownership of the Democratic National Committee. 
Lily Vaughan is a junior majoring in history and political science. Her column,“Playing Politics,” runs Fridays.
For practical political purposes, yes, I agree that it is in the best interest of liberals and leftists to elect the DNC. We need to come together in votes; but that doesn’t make the DNC immune to criticism. I don’t appreciate the tone of your post – “quit whining/crying” – just like you said, the DNC isn’t made to accommodate everything left of center. I don’t see where you are getting at, then, by asking the “whiners” to go elsewhere.
“If you curl your lip at centrism, if realists…” Sorry – these people also need to be a part of the DNC because that is exactly what divided the DNC. If you’re looking for neoliberals, many of them are voting GOP now. You may keep trying to have the pretense of The Thoughtful Centrist but centrism won’t take us anywhere. The DNC needs an active platform and people willing to fight for it. It’s not a dichotomy with realism. You can be diplomatic and make things work while still sticking to your platform and not being a centrist. What Obama did was hardly, hardly centrist.
A sensible article. But what would make it better, would be discussion of a key question:  To what degree does the DNC finance the Democratic Party candidates for President during the Primary and after? This percentage should be compared to how much each candidate can raise for himself or herself. This is critical, because it bears directly on the power and importance of the DNC.

Given Hollywood’s tendency to recycle characters and stories for films, it is always refreshing when directors focus on originality. Writer, producer and director Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri exemplifies this perfectly. The movie tells the story of a grieving mother who rents three abandoned billboards outside her hometown to attract the attention of the local police department and incite it to continue investigating her daughter’s violent murder — a concept so oddly specific it makes me wonder how McDonagh even came up with this idea and pitched it to Fox Searchlight. 
Frances McDormand, in the lead role of the divorced single mother Mildred Hayes, carries the movie and delivers a stellar performance that puts her ahead in the running for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. She appears mostly stoic and seems to only express feelings of anger and gloominess. However, through her subtle expressions and the intricacy of her line delivery, she effortlessly communicates her character’s crankiness, wittiness and pain. These qualities are important in an actress portraying Hayes, who must display a strong sense of determination in eliciting attention from the police despite countless roadblocks that hinder her from reaching her goal. 
Although the cast is large, McDonagh displays directorial intuition in deciding when to include characters in scenes so that none of their roles become overused or tiresome. In some ways, Woody Harrelson’s portrayal of police chief William Willoughby is just a characterized version of his real-life persona. But unlike most characterized performances, he pairs his own personality with strong, but subtle expressions of concern and wit  that are characteristic of Willoughby. 
As police officer Jason Dixon, Sam Rockwell uses his mannerisms in his nuanced body movements and facial expressions to bring the character to life. The snide cop undergoes an unexpected arc that contributes greatly to the film; with the way the film establishes his controversial character, certain choices made for his story are bound to catch audience members off guard.

The acting, overall, is so excellent that even the extras are as compelling as the main characters. Sandy Martin, in particular, stuns in her role as Dixon’s mother. The interactions between all these characters are very strong, bolstered by McDonagh’s standout screenplay. With the exception of one slightly cheesy line, the dialogue flows just as naturally as the actors’ performances. The jokes in the script are seamless, as they blend into the scenes in which they are used and work well in the context of the film. The movie doesn’t lose its pace and some jokes are timed perfectly to create the intended effect. The rest of the dialogue forces viewers to involve themselves with the characters, as tensions between Hayes and the police slowly but steadily escalate. 
However, this isn’t the screenplay’s only strong suit. The film does not rush to reveal all the information as soon as possible;  rather, it integrates information in a way that flows well with the film’s rhythm and easily clarifies any doubts that the audience may have. Every plot point that could be perceived as cliche is either completely subverted or presented in a way that makes it feel less blatant and trite. Audiences will have an initial expectation of how the film will turn out, but then it will take them in the completely opposite direction, suddenly leaving them lost and more curious as to how the situation will play out. There are moments in which you will hope for one outcome, even though the film has no desire to provide a happy ending. Everything that happens is not only necessary for the plot but also fits with the film’s grim, yet comedic tone.
I didn’t know what to think of this film when I saw the insanely positive reception it picked up; part of me was skeptical that this film would not live up to the extreme praise. The minor flaws in this film were so few and far between that they could be passed off as tolerable annoyances, but the rest of the film was so strong that pinpointing these issues seems almost trivial. Apart from the concept, there was little to indicate that McDonagh’s third film would be one to stand the test of time. However, there’s really no other way around it — Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is truly a masterpiece.

Among other things, Breitbart News is famous for running articles suggesting birth control use makes women “unattractive” and “crazy,” and claiming feminism is worse than cancer. Now, it can add another seriously bizarre item to this list — its characterization of allegations against GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore’s history of sexual predation on teenage girls. 
According to a Washington Post report published this week, Moore allegedly asked a handful of teenage girls as young as 14 on dates and kissed and made sexual advances on them in the 1970s. Breitbart responded by attempting to debate the age of consent, and listing deeds by Moore that sounded romantic — he read one of his teenage paramours poetry, played the guitar and never moved farther than kissing. Breitbart may be known for its extreme tendencies, and yet pathetically enough, the phenomenon of romanticizing unhealthy, abusive romances in history, literature and popular culture is prevalent. 
From Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita, a graphic and horrifying tale of pedophilia, being perceived by some as a love story, to celebrations of E.L. James’ Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy — a hotbed for abuse, manipulation and coerced consent — as romantic, too often we see audiences pretend the lines between right and wrong can be blurred in order to fulfill their twisted personal ideas of what a good love story is. 
In Lolita, a middle-aged man seduces an orphaned adolescent girl, and tries to persuade his readers that his actions are somehow less deplorable because the young Lolita isn’t sexually “pure” because she spent a summer experimenting with boys her age. And so, in the eyes of her older abuser, he somehow isn’t to blame for taking advantage of her. And in the Fifty Shades trilogy, a multi-millionaire executive leverages his money, power and expansive business empire to stalk and coerce a young woman into ceding her rights to enter a sexually violent relationship with him.

And while recurring, frustrating allegations of sexual abuse in entertainment, politics and every sphere with disproportionate power dynamics are often unilaterally condemned by public figures, different aspects of abuse and manipulation continue to be romanticized in their work. Just last week, singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey publicly apologized for her 2014 song, “Cola,” in which she referenced Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein’s practice of lavishing young women with diamonds and her personal experiences with him. Her songs constantly narrate dark, doomed love stories, and that’s all well, but at the very least she recognized that in the present context, her lyrics about Weinstein’s sexual, coercive relationships with young, aspiring actresses crossed a line. 
I’m hardly one to sympathize with Breitbart — placing the word “Breitbart” in the same sentence as “sympathize” is actually a deeply uncomfortable act for me. And yet our collective societal fascination with romantic taboos has undeniably stunted some people’s ability to draw clear lines around right and wrong — or, in Moore’s case, legal and illegal —  to the extent that a popular conservative news outlet on Thursday seemed to characterize a middle-aged man’s relationships with and sexual predation of young women in a romantic light.
This, obviously, needs to change. The consequences of people thinking sexual coercion is tolerable — even romantic — have become increasingly clear amid rampant sexual abuse allegations across multiple industries. Hopefully, our collective disgust with Breitbart’s portrayal of Moore’s inappropriate relationships will help pave the way to change.

“Fifty Shades” is a crappy novel written by a woman and sold to an audience of women. Feminists are like Catholic priests: they love talking about the sins of “unbelievers” while ignoring their own disgusting behavior. For example, let’s talk about Kegan Allee, that lesbian feminist administrator who loves icky, icky stuff. Her favorite author is apparently Anais Nin, who “is best known for her two volumes of erotic literature, Delta of Venus and Little Birds, works that explored extremely dangerous sexual undertakings which included pedophilia, necrophilia, sadomasochism and even bestiality.”

Military Appreciation Week featured events including the Veteran and Military Families Recruiting Night, where about 45 employers came to recruit military and veterans to work for them. Photo courtesy of Josh Byun.
The Veterans Resource Center at USC hosted its annual Military Appreciation Week on campus this week, which featured events from professional development to community service.
“We really wanted to emphasize the military community, because it definitely takes an entire family to support their person that’s serving or has served,” VRC Coordinator Jennifer Perdomo said. “We appreciate them for their service and their time and their commitment, as well as show them all the supportive offices and departments that are on campus.”
The week kicked off with a “Salute to Veterans” event on Monday, which honored USC’s veterans and military members over lunch, followed by a professional development workshop sponsored by the Veterans Association at USC. It featured a brief informational presentation and allowed veterans to practice one-on-one interview skills and elevator pitches. 
Perdomo said the largest and most anticipated event of the week was Wednesday’s Veteran and Military Families Recruiting Night, a University-wide collaboration among several organizations, including the Provost’s office.
Around 45 employers attended the event, and 465 registered veterans and military family members came from as far as San Diego to participate, Perdomo said. 
Joshua Lynch, a senior majoring in business administration who helped coordinate recruiting night and was also the lead presenter for professional development workshops, said that career development is important for student veterans. 
“At this school, with the kind of opportunities you have, it’s not about what you know, but who you know,” Lynch said. “That applies everywhere, but it’s not always apparent to student vets, especially when networking isn’t a common or apparent strategy for navigating your career within the military, at least at lower levels of your career.” 
In addition to professional development events, free exercise classes were also offered to Military Appreciation Week participants through USC Recreational Sports. 
The week ended with a community service opportunity for veterans and military members to build homes through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity, as well as a free ticket to Friday’s basketball game against Cal State Fullerton and an invitation to a Trojan football watch party with the Veterans Alumni Network. 
Overall, Lynch said that this year’s Military Appreciation Week was a success. 
“There were plenty of opportunities to get involved — maybe too many,” Lynch said. “I think we covered most, if not all interests from the University interests and the interests of the student-vets.”

Homelessness Awareness Week is an annual event by the USC Homelessness Action Committee, which features events around campus to provide volunteer opportunities and destigmatize the issue. Daily Trojan file photo.
For many USC students, the issue of homelessness in Los Angeles is not something that comes to mind in everyday life. The USC Homelessness Action Committee aimed to change that by hosting USC’s annual Homelessness Awareness Week, which ran from Monday to Wednesday.
The event featured four events to educate students about the complex social problem of homelessness and to provide volunteer opportunities for interested students.
The committee was first founded last year to raise student awareness about Los Angeles’ Measure H, a tax bill for the largest homelessness funding program in the United States, but expanded its purpose after Measure H’s passage in spring 2017, according to the committee’s president, Cassie Woods, a graduate student studying public administration. 
The committee is also associated with the USC Initiative to End Homelessness, a program started after Provost Michael Quick classified homelessness as a “wicked problem” that the University had the responsibility to tackle. 
Held on Monday at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, the first event of the week was a documentary screening and discussion that focused on stigmas associated with homelessness and how to address them. 
The documentary, The Invisibles, was made by Dworak-Peck clinical professor of field education Rafael Angulo, and told the stories of four individuals who had experienced homelessness and the hardships they faced. 
Following the screening, attendees participated in a discussion that featured youth who had experienced homelessness, from the organization Safe Place for Youth, which provides drop-in services, health services, education programs and more for youth experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles area. 
“I think it definitely presented well the personal stories of those people and how it is possible to have their lives transformed, once they get housing,” said Forrest Scharmer, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, who attended multiple events during Homelessness Awareness Week. 
That event was followed the next day by a talk given by Jim Burklo, associate dean of religious life, at the University Religious Center. Burklo spoke about fighting homelessness at a political level, focusing on the issue of what he referred to as Not In My Backyard activists, who, although supportive of helping homeless individuals, don’t want shelters built in their neighborhoods. The talk also featured Brenda Wiewel, director of the USC Initiative to Eliminate Homelessness. 
“Burklo and [Wiewel] gave very good practical advice for how we can get involved in the political process to help these initiatives like lower-income housing, safe parking, how to make them move forward,” Scharmer said. “I’m definitely going to go to more city council meetings — I’ve heard it before, but they just reinforced it here that it’s really important to go.”
The events of the week culminated on Wednesday, when the committee hosted a volunteer fair in Alumni Park during the day, and a guest panel discussion on Measure H in the evening. 
The volunteer fair featured over 15 nonprofits in the Los Angeles area, giving students the opportunity to get involved in the fight against homelessness with organizations that best suited them. 
The panel discussion featured three experts working directly to tackle homelessness: Elizabeth Heger, director of family programs at People Assisting The Homeless; Briana Mandel, director of program development and training at Imagine LA; and Kenon Joseph, a regional coordinator for the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.
They spoke about the impact Measure H has had since its passage in spring this year, analyzing its actual effect on the fight to end homelessness in Los Angeles. 
With those four events, Woods hopes students can learn about homelessness while also prompting them to take action against it.
“I also want to provide them with concrete actionable steps, so if they want to do something, I want to open the doorway for them to find that route,” Woods said.

The Young Researchers Program was founded in 2009 by two doctoral students in the earth sciences department to provide research skills for local high school students interested in STEM fields. Photo courtesy of Erin McParland.
The USC Young Researchers Program is evolving in its seventh year as a summer program for high school juniors and seniors, which is run by USC doctoral candidates and mentors to integrate local students into research conducted at the university.
The main purpose of the program is to have one-on-one mentoring sessions between the high school student and the graduate student in a professional laboratory setting. 
The program was founded in 2009 by Carie Frantz and Laurie Chong, two former graduate students in the earth sciences department, with the help of professor Will Berelson.
“I knew I wanted to be a mentor for YRP when I first started at USC,” said Emily Burt, a doctoral student studying geological sciences. “I thought it was a tangible way to help increase diversity [in] academia and also for me, personally, to start gaining mentorship skills right away.” 
The program provides free interactive experiences to students within a five-mile radius of USC, especially to those who are underrepresented in the community and in the sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics fields, according to doctoral student Joyce Yager, the program’s recruitment coordinator. Through the Young Researchers Program, these students are able to develop research skills while being exposed to college and laboratory work.   
“I think that this program really gives students the confidence to work in a research lab and be on a college campus,” Burt said. “They’re gaining research skills but also getting some college preparedness about the different aspects of applying to college like financial aid, admissions and four-year institutions.”
The application opens during spring, and students are admitted to the program through a lengthy process that includes short-answer questions, personal statements and letters of recommendation. Afterwards, the program board reviews and selects the best applications.
“We are just looking for students who show a genuine interest in the STEM field and also for those who never had an opportunity like this,” said Erin McParland, a doctoral student studying marine biology and biological oceanography. “We try to bring in students who are very impressive applicants who just never had the chance to shine.” 
Each high school student is paired with a graduate student and given six weeks to create a research poster based on their specialized topic, McParland said. The students are also expected to work 15 hours a week over the summer to complete their research. 
“I was interested in volunteering and working with a student,” Yager said about her experience as a doctoral student. “Especially since as graduate students, one of the things that we think about is if we are going to become faculty members a few years from now and mentoring our own students. So mentoring high school students is a great way of starting to work on those skills.” 
The doctoral student-volunteers study in a variety of specialized fields, such as marine biology and engineering. The types of sciences researched vary from year to year because they are based on the preferences of the student, Yager said. Many of the mentees are matched with a mentor who is studying and already doing research in a field that they are interested in. However, in Yager’s experience volunteering, the most common sciences that are explored are neuroscience, chemistry, computer science, geology and biology. 
“A good number of the research projects tend to fall under testing different methods that graduate students might use,” Burt said. “The research project that my mentee did was testing the way that we collect water from soils to see if that affected its chemistry. Some other students learned to code games using Python or they learn how to create codes to manage information systems.”
At the end of the program, the students present their research posters to USC faculty, mentors and their family members at a poster symposium. 
The mentors hope that YRP cultivates more underrepresented students to develop an interest in pursuing a career in STEM and to build confidence in applying to and attending a four-year college.

When the Week 11 College Football Playoff rankings were released on Tuesday, USC vaulted to No. 11 in the polls, up six spots from last week. The Trojans are now positioned to make some noise on the national stage if they win out and capture the Pac-12 Championship. But for now, head coach Clay Helton and his team are concerned about the task at hand: a tough road game on Saturday against Colorado. 
“We’re just focused on the next game, to be honest with you,” Helton said. “This team has always been about preparation and treating it like a playoff game, each game like a playoff game.”
This year’s Colorado team has been disappointing compared to last year’s — and for good reason. In 2016, the Buffaloes shocked the college football world by finishing the regular season at 10-2 and capturing the Pac-12  South for the first time in school history.  After building a reputation as one of the most woeful Power-5 conference schools in the nation, Colorado earned its first winning season since 2005 and its first ten win season since 2001. Head coach Mike MacIntyre won the Walter Camp Coach of the Year Award for leading the massive turnaround. 
Following up the team’s magical 2016 season was never going to be easy. Colorado clinched bowl eligibility in October last year, but the Buffaloes are still fighting for that goal right now, sitting at 5-5 with two games left. Saying a return to the Pac-12 Championship lies out of reach is an understatement, as Colorado currently stands dead last in the South division. The Buffaloes’ lack of success might be a tad misleading, however. Unlike last year when the team found ways to eke out close games against the likes of Oregon, Stanford and Utah, Colorado has been on the other side of the 8-ball in 2017. Three of its five defeats were decided by less than two touchdowns. 
“They put good defensive personnel on the field and they’re very well coached,” Helton said. “I haven’t seen any fall off from last year … The kids are playing very fast, very physical and you look at it, they’ve been in close ball game after close ball game against some really good teams.”
Colorado’s biggest strength is undoubtedly its ground game anchored by star running back Phillip Lindsay. The undersized (5-foot-8, 190 pounds), yet deceptively powerful back averages 133.4 rushing yards a game on an FBS high 263 carries. He’s a threat out of the backfield too, with 11.7 yards per reception (he snagged a nifty 60 yard catch last week). In spite of Lindsay’s fantastic and prolific season, Colorado has struggled to convert his production into points, ranking second-to-last in the conference with 28.0 points per game. 
The Trojans are tasked with stopping Lindsay and Buffalo quarterback Steven Montez (2,404 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, seven interceptions), after two solid defensive outings against Arizona and Arizona State. USC has shown a knack for making big plays on defense, recording the most sacks in the Pac-12 (34) and the second-most interceptions (13), yet the team still grapples with consistency. Against Arizona, the Trojans’ defensive front bottled up quarterback Khalil Tate in the first half but then allowed him to explode in the final two quarters. He rattled off runs of 32, 21 and 52 yards in the second half, bringing the Wildcats back from a seemingly insurmountable 22-point deficit. 
The defense could potentially be aided by the return of sophomore defensive lineman Christian Rector, who broke his hand in practice a couple of weeks ago. He practiced with his hand clubbed on Thursday, and Helton said he will be a gametime decision for Saturday. 
On the offensive side of the ball, USC is starting to fire on all cylinders. 
Sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold threw an ugly interception on the goal line last week, but otherwise played a spotless game, completing 77 percent of his passes to 10 different receivers combined with three touchdown strikes. 
Meanwhile, junior running back Ronald Jones II carried over momentum from his season-high 216- yard rushing performance against Arizona State, rumbling for 194 yards and three touchdowns against the Wildcats. The “Texas Tesla” will not have to shoulder the entire rushing load against Colorado. Freshman back Stephen Carr is finally healthy after being plagued by a foot injury for weeks, and junior Aca’Cedric Ware burst open for a breakout game last week. His 122 yards on 8.7 yards per carry helped the Trojans reach the 300-yard rushing benchmark for the third time this season. 
“I’ve been really pleased with what [offensive coordinator Tee Martin] has done,” Helton said. “When you think about where we are right now, we’re a very balanced offense. We’re rushing for over 200 yards a game, throwing for almost 300. It’s the best offensive numbers since 2005.”
Saturday’s game kicks off at 1 p. m. PST. USC leads the all-time series with Colorado 11-0.

USC women’s basketball begins a new season against Montana State on Friday, but the team is full of recognizable faces. Even head coach Mark Trakh, who replaced Cynthia Cooper-Dyke after her resignation last season, has been around the block before. He coached the USC women’s team from 2005 to 2009, leading the Trojans to two straight NCAA tournament appearances. After spending the last six years at New Mexico State, Trakh feels back at home.
“I’m really happy,”  Trakh said. “It’s a great institution, it’s a great place to coach, the tradition and everything. It was a great five years when I was here the first time, getting to know everybody and I’m really, really excited to be back. It’s a dream job.”
As Trakh gets set for his second tenure as head coach, he inherits an experienced roster that showed flashes of potential last season. 
Four of the team’s five projected starters played significant minutes in 2016-17, but the fifth is no rookie. Sixth-year senior Jordan Adams tore her ACL five games into last season and was granted an extra year of eligibility by the NCAA. The versatile guard holds career averages of 6.1 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists.
“She joked with me, ‘I think you recruited me the first time you were here,’” Trakh said. “She’s a great kid, the glue that holds us all together.” 
In addition to Adams, senior Sadie Edwards (9.2 points per game), sophomore Minyon Moore (2017 Pac-12 All-Freshman), and junior Aliyah Mazyck (40 3-pointers made) make up an accomplished and battle-tested collection of guards. The backcourt, however, will have to replace the 3-point production of Courtney Jaco, who graduated last spring. Jaco is second all-time in school history for 3-pointers.
“She’s obviously one of the best shooters in the history of the University of Southern California,” Edwards said. “That’s no easy task, but Aliyah has been in the gym improving, she’s been shooting the ball extremely well. Having Jordan back will help stretch the floor, and I have been in the gym working really hard on [my 3-point shot].” 
In the frontcourt, senior Kristen Simon returns, bringing back her powerful, bruising style of play. She looks to build on an All-Pac-12 year in 2017, in which she averaged 14.6 points a game and recorded 10 double-doubles. 
Last season under Cooper-Dyke’s leadership, the Trojans raced to an impressive start finishing 9-2 in their non-conference slate. But the team quickly crumbled in Pac-12 play, losing seven of their first eight match-ups. They finished with a 14-16 record and a last place conference finish. 
“This year, we have a lot more excitement and energy on the floor,” Adams said. “I just think this coaching staff really stresses family and togetherness. If we can play like that, play together and share the ball, then we’re going to be alright.”
While so many aspects of the Women of Troy look familiar as they enter their 2017-18 campaign, Trakh has noticed at least one difference from when he last coached the team nearly a decade ago.
“All the facilities have upgraded a lot,” Trakh said. “But basically, it’s just the same special place that I left.”

Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
Hey, remember when the season ended three weeks ago?
Members of the media hate being wrong, but I couldn’t be more thrilled to eat crow right now. After USC got humiliated 49-14 at Notre Dame last month, fans and analysts alike dismissed the Trojans as a mirage. No one was spared: Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold was dubbed overrated, people called for head coach Clay Helton to get the axe (along with pretty much everyone else on his staff) and the squad as a whole was slammed for a perceived lack of effort. Considering how hapless USC looked against the Fighting Irish, it was difficult to dispute — no matter how stubbornly Helton insisted the team’s season-long goal of winning the Pac-12 Championship remained within reach. The College Football Playoff dream was dead, and with no semblance of momentum on their side, the Trojans looked like they were heading toward a late-season collapse.
“There’s no bright spot to look to anymore,” I wrote the week after Notre Dame. “It’s hard for me to believe that Helton and company will suddenly clean things up to win the Pac-12, which means that after all the fanfare, it’s just another lost season.”
Then USC reeled off back-to-back wins over Arizona State and Arizona. The Trojans made a surprising jump all the way to No. 11 in the most recent CFP rankings, and a win at Colorado on Saturday can clinch the Pac-12 South with one game to spare in the regular season. I suppose I could still ultimately be proven right — the Trojans haven’t been overly consistent on either side of the ball even during their recent wins. Right now, though, I thankfully sound like an idiot.
Despite climbing six spots in the rankings, USC remains outside the serious playoff discussion barring an insane final month across college football. But this isn’t a lost season — not even close. If the Rose Bowl weren’t acting as a playoff game this season, the Trojans would have their sights set on a repeat New Year’s trip to Pasadena, and a conference championship would be the program’s first since 2008, when Pete Carroll roamed the Coliseum sidelines.
In fact, this season has the potential to be USC’s best since the Pete Carroll era. The team has up to three games left in the regular season (assuming it reaches the Pac-12 Championship). If they manage to win out and seize the conference crown, the Trojans will enter their bowl game — likely a marquee New Year’s Six matchup against another top-15 side — with an 11-2 record. One more victory to wrap up the year would put them at 12 wins: the highest total since Carroll’s 12-1 farewell season. Were people really saying “fire everyone” three weeks ago?
Not to say that a Pac-12 title or big bowl game are already a given — we’ve seen too many mistakes this season to assume anything. The Trojan defense has been prone to giving up the occasional big play all season (as illustrated by Arizona’s furious comeback last weekend), and the offense has sometimes tired out the defense with repeated three-and-outs between quick scoring drives. But if the Trojans manage to stay disciplined, Colorado shouldn’t be able to out-play them. The Buffaloes (5-5) sit in the Pac-12 South cellar, and more than half of their wins came in a season-opening homestand against Colorado State, Texas State and Northern Colorado. Colorado does sport a sharp 4-1 record at home thanks to the trio of victories, but it has split its only two conference games so far in Boulder — a loss to Arizona and a win over Cal.
Meanwhile, the Trojans are getting stronger and healthier. This weekend, they look forward to the return of redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Christian Rector, who has broken out as a pass-rushing force for USC this season, and junior running back Ronald Jones II looks to approach the 200-yard rushing mark for the third consecutive game. After scoring 40 or more points just twice in their opening eight weeks, the Trojans have now scored 97 points across their last two tilts. Unsurprisingly, they go into Boulder as close to two-touchdown favorites.
Of course, it would be classic USC to crush fans’ souls just as the team pulls us all back in. It would take a collapse of epic proportions to miss the Pac-12 title game, but you wouldn’t put it past this maddening squad, which has looked dominant at points against Stanford and Arizona but played down to the level of Western Michigan and Oregon State. Nevertheless, the Trojans also have the opportunity to build on last season’s Rose Bowl success in 2017 and put all doubts about Helton’s leadership to rest.
Yes, it’s hard to fathom, but USC can actually finish this season better than last year’s thrilling campaign. There’s still plenty of opportunity for the Trojans to blow it yet and limp to another four-loss campaign. But with four more wins, the Trojans will be conference champions and victors of another New Year’s Six bowl.
This season’s a long way from dead.
