Those who knew of Trustee and Rossier School of Education namesake Barbara J. Rossier, who died Aug. 11 at age 78 after a battle with lung cancer, remember her most for her unwavering commitment to education.
For those who knew Rossier personally, however, her commitment to education was matched only by her commitment to the Trojan community.
To USC graduate Blessing Waung, class of 2010, Rossier was not only an incredible university figure, but also a personal mentor.
“I met her at Town and Gown when I was a sophomore,” Waung said. “You’d think that she would be so intimidating because she was a trustee and a namesake, but she was the warmest, most genuine woman.”
In September 1998, Rossier and her husband, Roger, made a $20 million donation to the university’s School of Education — the largest gift ever made to an education school in the nation at the time.
“They wanted to leave a legacy of education,” Waung said. “That was the defining word of her lifetime — education.”
The school, which was renamed the USC Barbara J. and Roger W. Rossier School of Education in honor of the groundbreaking donation, has risen to 17th in the nation in graduate schools of education, according to U.S. News & World Report.
“The entire Trojan Family mourns the passing of Barbara Rossier,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement. “With her extraordinary energy, unshakable integrity and abiding commitment to providing excellent educational opportunities for everyone, she was an inspiration to us all.”
A proud Trojan, Rossier received her master’s degree in educational guidance in 1962, her Master of Education in 1970 and her Doctor of Education in 1971. Her involvement with the university, however, didn’t end at graduation. A university trustee since 1999, Rossier served for 20 years on USC Rossier’s Board of Councilors. She was also a member of the Alumni Association Board of Governors and the USC Associates Board of Directors.
Waung met Rossier through her sorority, Gamma Phi Beta, of which Rossier was honored as an alumna initiate. Rossier’s involvement, however, spanned the university.
In 1992, Rossier received the USC Alumni Association’s Alumni Service Award. Four years later, she was honored with the USC Rossier School of Education’s Recognition of Outstanding Service in Education (ROSE) Award.
From her cardinal and gold Smart Car to attendance at every football game, Rossier’s commitment to the university was unwavering.
“[The Rossiers] were just so genuinely proud to have served the school together,” Waung said. “Above all else, they were so proud to be Trojans. They would go to all the football games. They went to conferences everywhere from South Korea to Antarctica to support the university’s endeavors.”
To Waung, Rossier’s legacy represented what it truly meant to be a member of the Trojan Family.
“We talk about the Trojan Family, sure, and when you see someone from USC you can relate to them,” Waung said. “But when you treat them as one of your own, I feel like that’s what she taught me.”
Rossier is survived by her husband and their two sons, Dan and Steve.

For a student that graduated from USC in 1987, the year a gallon of gas cost 89 cents, monthly rent cost $395, and the cost of tuition and fees at USC was $10,564 for an entire year. A student attending USC in 2013 paid a price almost four times higher: $43,722
Even though Congress passed a rate reduction for unsubsidized Stafford loans last year, this year’s legislation reduces rates for all federal student loans. Eighty percent of students who are on subsidized loans are also being loaned unsubsidized funds.
The legislation, signed into law on Aug. 9, will save students an estimated $1,500 per year. It also ties the interest rate on all federal loans to the interest rate on the 10 year Treasury Note, the same interest rate the government pays to borrow funds from the public. In addition, the law will postpone an upcoming 3 percent hike in interest rates, which was seen as potentially devastating for incoming students.
The law will also put an end to yearly uncertainty about the change in the interest rate on loans: According to a press release from Peter McPherson, president of the Association of Public Land-Grant Universities, “interest rates on subsidized federal loans for college won’t double from last year, and a long-term fix will be in place to avoid these annual political chess matches over the loan program.”
Besides deterring potential students from attending certain colleges, the rising expense of tuition has forced many to take out massive loans for colleges’ tuition, causing a crisis of credit in the student-age demographic.
The average college graduate in 2008 walked off the graduation stage with a diploma and twice the debt as a graduate in 1996. A new report released by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on the status of direct federal student loans reveals that 18 percent of debt-laden students are in “distressed borrower” programs or have gone back to school, and 8 percent are in default, which means they haven’t submitted a payment for a year or more.
“I think that it is a shame that in the world’s richest country, students have to go into debt in order to obtain a decent education,” said Chris Patterson, a junior majoring in political science.
Though interest rates will undoubtedly rise at some point in the future, students are safe for now. Many USC students say the impact of student loans on their lifestyle is enormous.
“Some of my closest friends on loans have to make changes in daily spending by avoiding excess unnecessary goods,” said Ideen Saiedian, a sophomore majoring in business. “Although it creates a better sense of judgment with regards to spending and saving, I think that effect is minimal. The greater effect is probably that it influences decisions to get a job during otherwise free time like the summer.”
The new student loan law could be especially important for students at private universities like USC, where tuition rates tend to be much higher than those at public universities.
For Michael Yoshimura, a senior majoring in political science and business, the interest rate reform is a step in the right direction.
“I would prefer it if all federal student loans had 100 percent deferred interest until after graduation, because it would help out a lot of people with paying off that initial interest that keeps on compounding over the life of the loan,” he said. “But any bit off my final bill helps out a lot.”
In a statement prior to signing the legislation, President Barack Obama said, “our job is not done, because the cost of college remains extraordinarily high.”
Obama pledged to continue discussing the possibility for reform in the coming weeks.
USC’s tuition, not including room and board, is well above the average for a private university. According to USC’s online schedule of classes, the current per semester rate is $21,861, or $43,722 for the year. Between 2000-2001 and 2010-2011, prices for undergraduate tuition, room and board at public institutions rose 42 percent.
These statistics lead some students to conclude that the average of $1,500 in savings each year is not enough.
“[It’s] not at all enough to cover how expensive tuition has gotten, especially at private schools like USC,” said Dan Graham, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “With such a minimal change, I think that it’s actually more harmful in the long run because students who aren’t very informed will probably take out more loans than they would have before after hearing about the policy change.”
The USC Financial Aid Office has made a clear effort to combat both the rising cost of tuition and the economic downturn. This is reflected in the office’s mission statement.
“In recognition of the effects of the global recession on families, the total of university-funded financial aid has consistently increased over the last few years,” the statement reads.
Dean of Financial Aid Thomas McWhorter said the university has remained unwavering in its commitment to help students afford tuition.
“Even while the cost of tuition is rising, the university’s commitment to financial aid is pretty impressive,” McWhorter said. “We are continuing to do everything we can to make sure we continue to have need-blind admission and meet the full need of our undergraduate students.”
According to the office’s website, the university awarded over $429 million dollars in financial aid last year, including loans. USC ranks well below the national average in both the cohort default rate and the average debt per graduating student. Forty-five percent of USC students borrow federal loans.
McWhorter said this is due in part to USC’s money-savvy student body.
“We have a very high-quality student body, so our students are successful: They are graduating, making money and paying back their loans,” he said. “We find that students are being pretty judicious about which loans that they take and are making good choices about how they spend money.”
You skip a couple important facts.
In 1987 the average starting salary for a college graduate was around $15,500 / year. It was $18,700 when O graduated USC in 1991.  It’s $46,400 today.
In 1987 loans were issued by private lenders and only “guaranteed” against default by the government, today the government issues them, Onama changed that after the financial crises which was caused in part by people notnpayingnback loans.
Loans are optional no one is forced to take them, but if you borrow money part of being an adult and a responsible member of society is repaying them.  
Government debt as a % of GDP in 1991 was less than 40%.  Since 1/20/2009 it has gone from 62% to 108% and the gov will run out of money again in Oct.  spending is nothin line with gov income and the current administration has run trillion dollar deficits for 5 straight years.  
Yes tuition is out of hand, but student loans aren’t the problem.

Mayor Eric Garcetti’s office announced today that former University of Southern California Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Associate Dean Linda Lopez will serve as Chief of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs.
Lopez has been serving as the USC Dornsife Associate Dean for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives. She has a Ph.D. in political science from USC.
“It is a privilege and an honor to join Mayor Garcetti’s administration to help L.A. immigrants cut through red tape and make City Hall work for them,” Lopez said in a statement released by the mayor’s office.
During his time on City Council, Garcetti worked to reestablish the office. Creating an office to work with immigrants was also part of the mayor’s campaign platform.
“The Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs will play a critical role given L.A.’s large immigrant population and the national spotlight on immigration legislation,” Garcetti said in a press release.
The office will help documented and undocumented immigrants to navigate a pathway to citizenship, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Robert Hernandez, Marcia Dawkins and several other USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism faculty and graduate students held “Storytelling with Google Glass,” a forum about the impact and the possible uses of Google Glass in the field of journalism. The event was the first in a weekly journalism and public relations forum series, to be held every Tuesday at noon.
Faculty members and forum attendees tried out the new product and discussed its implications for journalism. Google Glass is a wearable computer with a prism that projects images directly in front of the eyes. Currently, Google Glass is very limited, with only a small amount of apps available, though Google has released the code for third-party developers to work on.
“The functionality of Google Glass will be much [greater] once native applications for it are developed,” said David Carr, a sophomore majoring in computer science and a “Google Glass explorer.”
According to the forum, Google Glass needs to be tethered to an Android smartphone in order to fulfill most of its functions, including news streaming and access to social media sites.
“The biggest downside is definitely the lack of internet connectivity,” said Alex Leavitt, a doctoral candidate in communications at Annenberg who owns a pair of Google Glass.
The main focus of the forum was the product’s use in journalism. Hernandez and Leavitt presented a few examples of how they used Google Glass to take point-of-view videos.
Hernandez said he believes that the main impact the glasses will have is not in content creation, but rather content delivery, by changing the way users of Glass receive news and other publications.
“It’s another tool in our toolbox, and it’s definitely something,” Hernandez said.
The Glass explorers demonstrated that taking pictures requires only a few hand swipes across the touch-sensitive panel on the left side of the device , or a voice command, making it much faster and simpler than using a phone camera. Glass explorers also spoke about how, for them, Google Glass will be a catalyst for discussions of privacy because using the glasses makes the wearer acutely aware of privacy violations.
“I think Google Glass is a cool idea, but it would sometimes be pretty intrusive on privacy,” said John Atyeo, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering.
The forum leaders also touched on how Google Glass affected the social aspects of their lives.
“I had to force myself to wear it,” Hernandez said. Sometimes, he said his friends cracked jokes at his expense, or he would draw unnecessary attention in public. Other Google Glass wearers mentioned that they had to deal with strangers being scared or put off after seeing that they were wearing Google Glass.
Despite a small amount of awkwardness, the general vibe of the forum was that this was something on the cutting edge.
“Google Glass kind of symbolizes our entrance into an era in which our lives become more wholly dependent on technology,” said Sarah Joh, an undecided freshman.

Thanks David,
As you say, the jury is still out, but the primary witnesses are not speaking. I do not know your background or relationship, if any, to Google. I have not read of Google or any other wireless device company for that matter, assuming responsibility to devote their considerable economic and professional staff resources to investigating the potential damaging health effects of their devices and informing their consumers to allow each consumer an informed choice. 
There has been a very rapid increase in EMF emitting devices we are exposed to on a daily basis (cellphones, laptops, tablets, SMART gas/electric/water meters, “wireless campuses”. As you note, there will be more and more since wireless technology seems to be the current “cash cow” of Silicon Valley and elsewhere. 
The cumulative and lifetime exposure of the ever increasing EMF emitters has not been addressed. It seems especially critical for the current college age population that the potential carcinogenic or other health effects are investigated since this age cohort has grown up with cell phones and the array of other expanding EMF emitting devices. Seems this topic is an excellent basis for many engineering and medical student research projects and faculty grants for the good of all. 
I do think the tech industry needs to be more forthright with consumers and take an active role protecting the health of its consumers or risk appearing in a negative light as Big Tobacco did in the 1960’s downplaying, or worse, smoking as a risk factor for cancer and heart disease.
I encourage all to keep tabs of the research suggesting carcinogenic effects of EMF emitting devices. The World Health Organization reclassified cell phones to a Class II carcinogen in 2011. This was due to studies showing a dose dependent relationship between cell phone use and gliomas (a type of cancerous brain tumor). Those with the highest cell phone use had a 40% greater chance of developing a glioma.
Google Glass sits right next to the frontal lobes. It is unfortunate and of concern that Google does not warn the public of potential dangers from Google glass use. Wireless tech has become a primary product of tech companies. The potential combined health effects of laptops, cell phones, tablets, SMART Meters and living/working on a wireless campus simply are not known, seemingly especially when wearing Google Glass is added to the mix.
The SAR levels measured on Glass are at or below those of mainstream smartphones, and Glass itself only contains low power WiFi and Bluetooth radios, not the higher wattage UTMS/GSM/CMDA/LTE radios found in phones.  But you’re right, the close proximity of Glass to the wearer makes this a more important topic.
The years ahead of us are going to bring a new wave of connected devices and sensors that are on us and around us, bringing a new age of contextual mobile computing.  But I think it’s important that you bring this up as the jury is indeed still out.

As the Trojans enter the 2013 season, the team’s offensive line has a surprising amount of stability. Even with the departure of three-year starter Khaled Holmes, the unit returns five players who have starting experience. The primary goal in fall camp was figuring out which combination of players gives the team its most effective unit.
Fourth-year offensive line coach James Cregg is joined on the line by Mike Summers, who will coach the offensive line alongside Cregg and serve as the running game coordinator.
Summers, who most recently held the same title with the Kentucky Wildcats for three seasons, brings an impressive pedigree and a wealth of experience to the coaching staff. He has coached both at the collegiate and professional level and his impact has already been felt at USC.
Summers and Cregg have many former four- and five-star high school recruits to work with on the line, and multiple players have displayed a knack for versatility thus far.
Junior Marcus Martin, who has spent the majority of the last two years at left guard, will spend this season at the center position. Though he had success at guard, the transition to a new position is one that Martin has fully embraced.
“I’m excited about it,” Martin said. “There is a big future there, and I’m happy to be playing center, and I’m thankful for the opportunity.”
Martin’s shift has created a vacancy at left guard, and the staff has had to move another player to fill the void. Enter sophomore Max Tuerk, who last season made USC history as the first true freshman to start at left tackle. Tuerk started at left guard for the first time last season in the Sun Bowl against Georgia Tech, and earned All-Pac-12 honorable mention honors for his strong freshman season.
Joining Tuerk on the left side of the line will be redshirt freshman Chad Wheeler. Arguably the biggest surprise of fall camp, Wheeler is a local product of Santa Monica High School and has gained more than 60 lbs. since he arrived on campus.
“It’s just hard work,” Wheeler said of his improvement this offseason. “It’s on every side. It’s not just strength, it’s also the technical aspects and knowing the playbook.”
The duo of Tuerk and Wheeler has certainly made an impression on USC head coach Lane Kiffin, who has been impressed by his young players’ performance.
“Those two kids are playing great together,” Kiffin said. “They have a great mentality about the game.”
Opposite of Tuerk on the interior line is a position battle for right guard. Incumbent senior John Martinez and junior Aundrey Walker, who has starting experience at left tackle, are vying for playing time. Martinez has started 25 consecutive games at this position, though Walker took the majority of the first-team reps toward the end of fall.
The Trojans have continuity at the right tackle position with senior Kevin Graf. With 25 starts under his belt, Graf is a veteran in the program and provides leadership and experience for the rest of the line. “Fall camp went very well for us,” Graf said. “This offensive line is coming along very well, and we just have to keep it going into the season.”
Though the unit has experienced many shifting parts thus far in the fall, it has the talent and experience to gel together and act as a formidable force for the team. It will soon be evident whether or not this combination gives the Trojans’ offense the power it needs to push the pile while also providing the time for the quarterback to direct a potent aerial attack.

Take a glance at the USC football schedule this year, and you’ll notice a few quirks: a couple of notable conference mainstays are missing that home game against Arizona isn’t on a Saturday and how are the Trojans playing 13 regular season games?
All of this makes for an interesting and unique schedule for USC this year, especially compared to the last few. Most notably, Oregon is off the slate for the first time since 2004, and Washington for the first time since 2000. Back on the schedule are Oregon State and Washington State after a    two-year hiatus.
The shift is due to the Pac-12’s new schedule rotation, which dictates out-of-division games. USC will play the Beavers and the Cougars for the next two years before returning to the Ducks and the Huskies in 2015 and 2016, then back again to Oregon State and Washington State in 2017, and so on.
It’s a dramatic difference in schedule difficulty for USC. The Ducks and Huskies have a combined 72 wins in the last four years, 42 by Oregon alone. In that same timespan, the Beavers and Cougars have won a combined 35 games.
Oregon State and Washington are more or less interchangeable as opponents. The Beavers have been slightly better in recent years, but the difference is insignificant compared to that of Oregon and Washington State. Playing Washington State instead of Oregon is quite literally swapping one of the top teams in the nation — not just the conference — with a team that hasn’t had a winning season in a decade and has finished dead last in the conference four years running.
The switch, however, does have one ominous consequence for USC: a trip to Corvallis, Ore., where the team’s last victory came in 2004. Twice the Beavers spoiled a probable title run for the Trojans with a shocking upset in Corvallis, knocking off No. 3 USC in 2006 and No. 1 USC in 2008, the lone loss of the season that year. In 2010, No. 20 USC converted just four of 16 third downs and was battered around by the unranked Beavers in the legendary Reser Stadium fog, which seemed to shroud all hope for USC.
This year’s trip to Corvallis will be for a Friday night game, one of three weeknight games on the docket for USC this year. The Trojans will open their season at Hawai’i on a Thursday and then host Arizona on Thursday, Oct. 10 at the Coliseum, the first regular season home game the Trojans will ever play on a Thursday that hasn’t fallen on Thanksgiving.
“It’s gonna be exciting,” USC redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard said. “The fans can come in during the week, maybe miss a couple classes. I’m sure some people will like that.”
The thought of some 70,000-plus people descending upon Downtown Los Angeles precisely at rush hour (kickoff is 7:30 p.m., meaning many people will be arriving at the Coliseum between 5 and 7 p.m.) is worrisome enough that the athletic department created a webpage dedicated to explaining some of the many ways this will be different from your average Saturday home game.
But the team isn’t concerned with traffic or a ban of on-campus tailgating. For them, it will be treated like all other games, with a hotel stay the night before and meetings throughout the day before heading to the stadium. And with no Saturday game the week before, the team will still have a full week of practice and then some.
“We’ll still bring that same intensity like it’s on Saturday,” Pullard said. “Coach [Lane] Kiffin still puts the emphasis on prep, not hype. When you’re prepared, you’re confident, and that’s our mindset.”
The only one of the three weeknight games where the schedule poses an issue is the Friday trip to Corvallis. USC hosts Utah the Saturday before, meaning the team will lose a day of rest that normally falls on Monday.
“It does break up your routine, and you try to stay in your routine as much as possible,” Kiffin said. “I don’t think many coaches would prefer that. I think we’d all just like to play every Saturday. But we also understand the impact of television contracts and why we do that, so we’ll just deal with it the best we can.”
With seven home games and six road trips, USC’s schedule is slightly imbalanced. The 13-game regular season is made possible by the Trojans’ season-opening trip to Hawai’i. The NCAA allows teams that make the trip out to the islands to schedule an extra home game, giving them extra revenue to offset the higher cost of travel.
“[The extra game] is just another chance to compete,” Pullard said. “Another chance to get better for postseason.”
The so-called “Hawai’i exception” allows USC to schedule four nonconference games — including Notre Dame — instead of three, adding in Utah State this year in addition to Hawai’i, Boston College and the Irish.
There is no particularly foreboding stretch this season, as there was last year when the Trojans took on three ranked teams in four weeks in No. 2 Oregon, No. 17 UCLA and No. 1 Notre Dame. This year, their four games against preseason ranked teams come every other week in a seven-week stretch to end the season, as Notre Dame, Oregon State, Stanford and UCLA are interspersed with Utah, Cal and Colorado.

I’ll admit that heading into the football season, USC head coach Lane Kiffin doesn’t have a lot going for him.
USC’s dive from preseason favorite to unranked with six losses last year was unprecedented, and Kiffin’s chilly public persona only fuels his detractors. If he wins fewer than nine games this upcoming year, there is a reasonable chance that he will be coaching elsewhere in 2014.
That said, there is an aspect of Kiffin that deserves some praise. In light of Aaron Hernandez’s murder charges and accounts of his transgressions stemming back to his days at the University of Florida, Kiffin’s ability to instill character and dignity in his players off the field warrants praise.
Fans all want a return to the early-2000s glory days of Pete Carroll, but as many Trojan diehards saw up close with the Reggie Bush scandal, the talent is not always worth the trouble.
For Kiffin, that mantra has held true. Not every player will be Matt Barkley, but for the most part, few will spend the night in jail or commit a crime.
We take it for granted, but Kiffin has run a nearly spotless ship when it comes to his players keeping out of trouble off the field. Former USC tight end Junior Pomee was arrested for burglary and similar charges this past February, but he walked the plank, as Kiffin booted him off the team.
Kiffin doesn’t make it a goal to be everyone’s “cool uncle” like former head coach Pete Carroll did. When both were at USC, Carroll was the party; Kiffin was the one breaking it up.
In 2011, former USC linebacker Everson Griffen organized a trip to Las Vegas with current USC players. Jordan Campbell, a former USC linebacker who was cited by police for a breach of peace with Griffen in 2009 when both were at USC, was also involved.
Partially out of fear for being suspected of giving improper benefits, athletic director Pat Haden banned the team from making the trip. I doubt Kiffin protested Haden’s decree. What happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay there, so the pair made sure the trip didn’t happen.
There will still be a drunken Marc Tyler rant or ineligibility due to golf cart issues once in a while, but Kiffin has kept the egregious incidents, such as arrests that seem to occur often at Ohio State or Florida, to an admirable minimum.
Winning is the goal every college football team goes into the season with. But at USC, fans should appreciate the job Kiffin has done on the recruiting trail since taking the job in January 2010. He’s racked up the star ratings, but also managed to sift out troublemakers before they even register for classes.
USC finished as one of  Rivals.com’s top 10 recruiting classes in Kiffin’s first three years, and just one of his recruits (Pomee) has run into legal trouble while at the university. In the Pac-12, only Stanford, Cal and UCLA have fewer arrests since Kiffin was brought in. Not only is he recruiting top talent, but he and his staff are controlling their players once they arrive on campus.
College football head coaches are often likened to father figures for their players. Kiffin is more along the lines of a principal, and that isn’t a bad thing. Growing up, few children want to be sent to the principal’s office. I imagine it’s the same for USC football.
He’s generally not friendly with the media. His sometimes-dispassionate demeanor doesn’t easily endear him to the raucous Trojan fan base. He’s going to keep everyone waiting with his decision on the starting quarterback. And his image from his admittedly immature days at Tennessee and with the Oakland Raiders still burns vividly in the minds of his many critics.
But Kiffin was born to coach. His father was a coach. His brother is a coach. When it comes to off-field disciplinary matters, Kiffin knows what he’s doing.
His coaching calls are still questionable and his public persona could be better. And if his team underperforms this season, he might be looking for a new job this winter. But don’t say Kiffin doesn’t know how to keep his players in line.

USC’s group of offensive skill players this season boasts a mix of returning talent and exciting young recruits expected to light up the field in 2013. With several capable recruits joining a field of returning players, USC should be able to spread out the ball more this year. This surplus of talent will take some of the burden off whomever the Trojans end up settling with at quarterback.
Ready for action · USC sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor (15) is primed for a breakout 2013 season after turning heads as a freshman. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Running Back
The team’s biggest strength appears to be in its backfield. Leading the charge for the running game is senior tailback Silas Redd. The highly touted former Penn State tailback amassed 905 yards rushing and nine touchdowns in his first campaign with the Trojans, and is looking to improve upon his efforts from last year.
“I want to stay healthy for the whole season,” Redd said. “A thousand yards, no fumbles, no missed assignments. I’m never one to complain about carries, but I definitely want over a thousand yards.”
Redd battled numerous injuries last season and required knee surgery in the offseason, which limited him in the summer and will force him to miss the season opener against Hawai’i. He had three carries or fewer in three games last season, and with departed running back Curtis McNeal battling injuries as well, the Trojans were left with a shortage of healthy scholarship running backs.
That should not be the case in 2013. USC is fortunate to have a deep stable of backs that will allow Kiffin to disperse carries as he sees fit and provide security should any player be injured.
Though Redd expects to be the primary ball carrier again this season, he will almost certainly be sharing carries with freshman tailback Justin Davis, who has surprised teammates and coaches with his physicality, quickness and natural instincts as a runner.
Davis’ strength is surprising considering he’s a true freshman. His north-south running ability invites contact, and Davis will oftentimes match or surpass the brutal strength of his defenders en route to yards after contact.
The Trojans’ deep stable of tailbacks will be rounded out by freshman Ty Isaac and redshirt sophomores Javorius “Buck” Allen and Tre Madden.
Madden, who missed all of last season with a torn ACL, is a particularly noteworthy addition to the backfield. As a true freshman in 2011, he appeared in all 12 games as a linebacker and on special teams. He switched to tailback the following spring and drew rave reviews in his first few days at the position, but suffered a knee injury shortly thereafter. With his addition, USC should have one of the most talented backfields in the conference.
“Our depth is finally back,” Kiffin said. “We have to produce on the field, but when you look at that position, you think, ‘Wow, that looks like a USC running back group.’ Some are inexperienced, but it’ll be exciting to see that group develop because that has been a goal of ours, to get that group back. I feel like we’ve got it back now.”
Joining the bevy of tailbacks are redshirt sophomore fullback Soma Vainuku and sophomore fullback Jahleel Pinner, who both showed their inexperience at times last year.
“The play of the fullback had a lot to do with issues last year, as we go back and look at the tape,” Kiffin said. “That had a lot to do with some of the short-yardage issues, too.”
Vainuku started last year but has been limited during fall camp, giving Pinner a chance to shine.
Kiffin may be intrigued by Pinner’s ability to catch the ball out of the backfield — especially after Vainuku failed to reel in a crucial fourth-down pass on the goal line in the waning moments of last year’s loss against Notre Dame.
“[Pinner] has done great,” Kiffin said. “You go through growing pains when you play guys earlier than they normally would. We went through that last year with him, and now he’s really coming along and is much improved.”
Wide Receivers
Even with the departure of Robert Woods to the NFL, USC’s receiving corps looked to be one of the deepest in the nation coming into the spring — but injuries have taken their toll in the offseason and thinned the group out considerably.
Oft-injured junior George Farmer was lost for the season when he tore his ACL in the spring, and freshman Steven Mitchell, who was considered an early favorite to start at slot receiver, succumbed to the same devastating injury during a voluntary summer workout.
Of course, having a Heisman Trophy contender in junior Marqise Lee, last year’s Biletnikoff Award recipient, helps offset those losses.
“I’ve made this statement before; he’s gonna leave here as the best [receiver] to ever play here,” Kiffin said, echoing his declaration from last September. “You can see the talent and the drive that he has … As a coach, you see that and realize how unusual that is.”
Sophomore Nelson Agholor seems poised to have a breakout season in 2013 alongside Lee after shining in the offseason.
“I really believe Nelson could have done similar things to what Marqise did his freshman year and Robert did his freshman year,” Kiffin said. “If he had been our No. 2 receiver [last season], I think he would have had the same type of numbers.”
Upstart freshman Darreus Rogers has set himself apart from junior Victor Blackwell and redshirt senior De’Von Flournoy for the No. 3 receiver spot with his performance in fall camp.
“He’s kind of made a significant play every day in practice,” Kiffin said. “We’re really excited about how he looks out there.”
Blackwell will likely still see playing time as one of the team’s few healthy wideouts, while Flournoy’s status is more uncertain, as he’s been in and out of practice since the spring with various minor injuries.
Tight Ends
Adding to the plethora of receiving targets is the Trojans’ talented group of tight ends. Though there are only three scholarship tight ends on the roster, each of them has the ability to be a major weapon.
The two front-line players are redshirt juniors Randall Telfer and Xavier Grimble. Listed as co-starters for the third consecutive year, each is a matchup nightmare for opposing defenses, listed as 6-foot-4 and 6-foot-5, respectively, and 250 lbs. each. The duo has combined for 18 touchdowns over the past two seasons, and figure to be an integral part of the team’s passing attack in 2013.
Joining Telfer and Grimble is sophomore Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick. Physically imposing at 6-foot-5 255 lbs., Cope-Fitzpatrick looks the part of a star tight end. Though he caught just two passes for 12 yards in 2012, and is playing behind two NFL prospects, he is expected to have an expanded role with few healthy scholarship receivers on hand.
“Those numbers are abnormally low, with five scholarship receivers and three scholarship tight ends,” Kiffin said. “We’re just going to have to do our best and make sure those guys can help us in different ways and in different roles.”

USC baseball coach Dan Hubbs has received a multi year contract extension, the school announced on Tuesday.
Hubbs was elevated from associate head coach and pitching coach just two days before the first game of the 2013 season after former head coach Frank Cruz was fired for an NCAA violation regarding practice hours.
Welcome back · USC head baseball coach Dan Hubbs (left, facing forward) led the Trojans to a 10-20 conference record in 2013, which was good for a tie for eighth-place in the always-difficult Pac-12. – Daily Trojan file photo
“I am excited for the opportunity to continue as the head baseball coach at USC. To coach at my alma mater is very special,” Hubbs said in a statement. “I look forward to building upon the rich tradition of USC baseball.”
Hubbs pitched for USC from 1991-93, earning All-American honors in his senior season. He has consistently referred to coaching at USC as his “dream job.”
The Trojans went just 20-36 last season, the 20 wins marking the lowest win total by any USC baseball team since 1957, when the Trojans went 18-4. A youthful squad showed promise, however, and the 2014 team will return six starters in the lineup and the entire starting rotation.
“The culture of this program is changing,” Hubbs said at the end of last season. “Guys are working extra on their own now. The kids have bought into the work ethic. It’s 35 guys invested in winning. And with another year’s experience and comfort, we’re gonna see a difference.”
Those comments echo what many of Hubbs’ players said last year, despite their struggles on the field. USC baseball is one of the most successful collegiate athletic programs of all time, but is mired in a decade-plus stretch of mediocrity.
The Los Angeles Times reported in July that USC offered UCLA head coach John Savage more than $1 million per year to take over the program, but he chose to stay in Westwood. Savage is a former USC assistant who led the Bruins to their first national championship in June.
Current Oregon and former Cal State Fullerton head coach George Horton was also rumored to be interested in the position, but USC chose to stick with Hubbs. Another coaching change would have given the program their fourth head coach in the last five seasons.

I hope Hubbs proves me wrong in the long run, but a multi year contract after last season is shameful . The
Athletic Dept. was looking hard to oust him with other offers , then turns around to keep him for more than
one season at a time. He was the top assistant in 2012 with a last place conference finish, and near the
bottom in 2013 with a .333 winning % getting swept by the ‘ruins for the 2nd consecutive year. Hubbs lost
five of six highly recruited players to the pros out of high school that doesn’t bode well for the next few years.
This would not be tolerated in football or even basketball.

Many students might have identified with a recent BuzzFeed article entitled “16 Signs You’re a College Student Who Needs to Go Back to School.” Granted, there is some pleasure to be derived from marathon sessions of Breaking Bad, but no one can stay away from the greatest place on earth for long. Now that students have arrived on campus, here are a list of apps that can enhance college life.
Need a Lyft? · The app Lyft helps students find a ride, and drivers are oftentimes distinguished by the pink mustaches on their cars. – Courtesy of Lyft
Venmo
There’s a great Seinfeld monologue in which he describes the horrible feeling of getting the check after a great meal: “We’re not hungry now, why are we buying all this food?” Odds are you’ve experienced the same thing, and it’s 10 times worse when you go out with friends. We’ve all been there: It’s the end of a great dinner and the check arrives, and unless someone is caught holding the bill, a small drama unfolds while everyone fumbles for cash and tries to figure out how much they owe while the waiter regrets not spitting in your food. And there’s the one guy who asks you to spot him and promises he’ll pay you back, but of course he never does. Now, there’s an app for that. Venmo allows you to pay your friends back right from your phone. You can link the app to your credit or debit card to make payments and “cash out,” or treat it like its own currency and simply receive and then send payments to friends. It’s a simple and effective way to deal with the hassle of being hungry students trying to go out for a meal.
Lyft 
If you’re not lucky enough to have a car on campus, and if you’ve experienced disappointment and frustration with Los Angeles public transportation, Lyft could be the solution for you. As its slogan “Your friend with a car,” suggests, Lyft is a ride-sharing service that matches you with drivers in your area, all of whom, Mom will be happy to know, have undergone DMV and background checks. After you get dropped off, you can donate through the app and drivers receive 80 percent of the donations.
GrubHub 
Students who get easily tired of redundant campus eateries such as EVK or Parkside can receive a change of pace with GrubHub, a mobile order pickup or delivery app from restaurants around campus. Simply enter a home address and the app will instantly find restaurants nearby, a great way to add variety to the college dining experience.
MapMyRun 
This app is a must-have for any runner. It uses a phone’s GPS to record routes, calculate distance, average split time per mile and, for users willing to divulge their weight, calories burned. Workouts are easily logged or even shared, and runners can compete with others in the area who run on the same trails.
Mint 
With a very simple interface that tracks expenditures to follow a budget, this personal finance app monitors users’ expenses, a feature that will come in handy after viewing that tuition bill. Syncing the app with a bank account allows users to view their expenses broken down by category and see where money is being spent each month. It also sends alerts when a user is spending more than usual on certain items and suggest areas where he or she can cut back. An excellent app to avoid awkward calls home for cash.
Evernote 
A simple and elegant digital notebook, Evernote allows users to take notes, add images and audio record anything in class or out. With apps available for iPhone, Android, iPad and a desktop version, it’s easy to sync notes across multiple devices. Consistently ranking highest among apps for productivity, Evernote is an excellent app to have in a student’s educational arsenal.
iTunes U 
With so much going on around campus, it’s easy to forget the primary reason to be here: To learn. iTunes U represents the future of education, a digital campus where students can take classes offered from hundreds of schools while lying on their bed in pajamas. iTunesU offers classes on anything from corporate finance to European civilization to mobile app development taught by some of the best professors in the world, and for free. All the course materials are easily downloadable, including quizzes and tests, and students can learn at their own pace. It’s a welcome departure from the normal registration process for classes, which always seems part lottery and part Darwinian struggle.

Gourmet cupcakes are so passé. Cronuts are the latest in the world of baked goods. As of last May, these hybrid creations brought together two unlikely allies, starting a sugary phenomenon.
It is hard to resist the heavenly smell of a freshly baked croissant, the crown jewel of every French boulangerie. Top that off with decadent cream filling, some killer glaze and fry it to perfection, and you’ve got yourself a deal with the carbohydrate devil. This, ladies and gents, is the divine-—or diabolical, depending on your dietary restrictions—culinary combination known as a cronut.
These delicate confections originated in New York City as a unique product of chef Dominique Ansel’s bakery and since their May 10, 2013 conception, they have taken the world by storm. That’s right, I said the world. Not only have cronut imitators popped up across the country, but Manila, Tokyo and Sydney also.
When I describe cronuts as delicate confections, I don’t just mean in the sense that they are flaky pieces of sugary happiness — they are actually physically fragile. According to Ansel’s Cronut 101 webpage, they can only be cut with a serrated knife (in order to preserve the pastry’s quaint architecture) and they should not be refrigerated since this would cause sogginess and the general decline of tastiness.
Ansel Bakery makes 200 cronuts per day and within minutes of its 8 a.m. opening, everything is sold out — people start queuing at least two hours before the bakery’s opening. Even celebrities such as Emma Roberts or Hugh Jackman must wait in line like everybody else and, in Roberts’ case, the cronuts sold out before she reached the front of the line. Never fear, though: Jimmy Fallon, a friend of Ansel, scored her one during a televised interview.
In other words, cronut hype has allowed Ansel Bakery to transcend the need for celebrity endorsement. Cronuts are the reigning A-listers of couture pastries.
Outside of Ansel’s SoHo bakery, cronuts cannot be found unless you’re willing to settle for imitation pastry. Ansel has gone so far as to trademark the name Cronut. DK’s Donuts, a 33-year-old Santa Monica donut shop, was even forced by Ansel’s lawyers to change its own Kronut to a less similar name, the O-Nut. Talk about possessive.
Cro-not definitely gets honorable mention for being one of the better imitator names, but most creative name has to go to Spudnuts Donuts in the Valley, where its product is called the doughssant, alternatively spelled Dough’Ssant. Though it’s not as short and quippy as cronut, doughssant sounds posh, and would actually be more fitting of the upper-crust reputation this pastry has garnered.
To be honest, I’m not even sure where or when I first heard that golden word uttered: cronut. But ever since, my taste buds slowly waged war against my better senses (the ones that encourage me to at least attempt to exercise), and I gave in to curiosity.
Though the original products can’t be found outside of New York City, I endeavored to see if worthy competitors existed in Los Angeles. According to LAEater.com and a well-aimed Google search, numerous imitators do exist, some of which arguably live up to their East Coast predecessor.
Before I began calling L.A. cronut spots for more information, I worried that long lines and limited supplies awaited me, as is the case for New Yorkers. Thus, I watched a how-to video from the Huffington Post and made my own cronuts (with lots of assistance from two kitchen-savvy friends).
Using Pillsbury crescent triangles, vegetable oil and a maple syrup glaze, we made “cronuts” in less than half an hour. The final product tasted great. Purists might contend that this is similar to buying knockoff designer products — you might not be able to perceive the difference but, deep down, you know. You know.
After some phone calls, I found that cronut-type pastries are easily found in Los Angeles. As mentioned before, DK’s Donuts offers the O-Nut, which is available 24 hours a day since they are continually made. Los Angeles already seems to be winning the customer-friendly aspect of this battle of the pastries.
Due to geographical convenience, I sampled the cronuts from Frances Bakery, a small shop located between Little Tokyo and the Downtown L.A. Arts District. To ensure an informed opinion, I placed an order for two cream-filled cronuts, a blueberry jam cronut and a chocolate cronut.
Nobody will be shocked to hear that cronuts are delicious. Ignoring their absolutely nonexistent health benefits, cronuts taste pretty magical. You can’t go wrong with a fried croissant covered and filled with mouthwatering ingredients.
I’ll bet you never thought a pastry fad could reveal any sort of significant truth about modern human culture, but think again.  My burning question is: What’s the big fuss over a piece of fried dough? Personally, I would not be willing to wait hours in line for a pastry that can be made at home and taste just as good.
The mentality behind the desperation for a cronut is alarming. It embodies conspicuous consumption literally, in that people are buying a product that takes no more than a minute to consume largely for their cultural significance. Don’t tell me you wouldn’t flaunt the prized last cronut of the day in the face of a forlorn child after waiting for hours.
It has also become second nature in our culture to share through social media what we are doing, where we are and what we are eating. These updates are most often intended to show others that we are engaging in the latest and greatest of products, and the amount of cronuts that have been Instagrammed since last May is probably horrendous.
I’m not claiming that my homemade cronuts could compete with Dominique Ansel’s professionally baked Cronut. On the other hand, I do think it’s important that, as a global consumerist community, we re-evaluate our priorities. Is a piece of deep-fried pastry really important enough to wait in line for?
Mostly, though, Ansel needs to bake more than 200 cronuts a day. I mean, come on.
 
This article was pretty light on information that was actually useful.
Pilsbury Crescent Triangles taste the same as a professionally made croissant?!? I’m not sure I trust your taste buds…

Without a doubt, one of the most highly anticipated albums of this year has been Earl Sweatshirt’s debut full-length release, Doris. Nearly four years have passed since a 16-year-old Thebe Kgositsile released his first (and only) mixtape, Earl.

This was quickly followed by the meteoric rise to prominence and notoriety in hip-hop circles brought about by the seemingly wild and nihilistic rappers that compose the ragtag family that is Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All — Tyler, the Creator at the helm and Earl as the slightly less rambunctious second-in-command.
Their music is gritty — delightfully imperfect, frequently dark and offensive, often hilarious and ultimately an extraordinary display of auteur-esque musicianship.
It was just as the skate mob/hip-hop collective began to find themselves at the center of what seemed to be a shift in youth culture when Sweatshirt, the rapper arguably possessing the most raw talent, inexplicably disappeared from the spotlight.
In early 2011, Complex magazine discovered that Sweatshirt had been sent to a reform school in Samoa for drug and behavioral issues. Odd Future fans were in uproar, followed by the seemingly universal condemnation of and outcry against his mother’s involvement. Sweatshirt, ostensibly overwhelmed, summoned a deep-seated maturity beyond his years and politely asked to be left alone.
Cut to the present day. Sweatshirt has since returned home, signed a deal with Sony under his own imprint of Tan Cressida and distribution through Columbia. The hype surrounding the stick thin, baggy-eyed rapper has reached its pinnacle while fans eagerly awaited a release — and now, Doris. The album, named for his late grandmother, is much like Tyler’s Wolf: far more introspective and self-critical than the Earl tape. Its blunt, brazen honesty is indicative not only of Earl’s deft rapping skills but also his continued growth.
The album’s starts on the wrong foot, as “Pre,” is arguably one of the weakest tracks due to SK LaFlare’s frankly asinine verse. The track features the braggadocious Sweatshirt that fans will recall from his earlier releases. “I’m a problem to n-ggas,” he raps in his first spoken line of the album, “Pop artillery, the carbonates with him / Starving to hit ‘em, spar with a n-gga,” then “Just watch, I’mma kill ‘em all in a minute.” He then spends the rest of the track asserting his premeditated dominance.
The Neptunes-produced second track, “Burgundy,” featuring frequent Odd Future collaborator Vince Staples begins with Staples berating Sweatshirt: “Why you so depressed and sad all the time like a little b-tch? What’s the problem man? N-ggas want to hear you rap. Don’t nobody care about how you feel.” Staples’ prelude comes to an end just as Earl explains, at least partially, the source of his stress-induced state of depression: “Grandma’s passing / But I’m too busy tryna get this f-ckin’ album cracking to see her / So I apologize in advance if anything should happen.”
“Burgundy” particularly sets the stage for the rest of the album’s narrative of “f-cked up” priorities and the constant desire to overcome both the nagging restlessness of his highs and the darkness of his lows.
The wobbly third track, “20 Wave Caps,” is very much reflective of Earl’s Odd Future affiliations. Featuring Domo Genesis, the dark track hearkens back to the anger present on the Earl mixtape, though now manifested in a manner that displays maturity. Earl addresses his contempt for his former friends who now treat him differently due to his enormous celebrity.
In the Frank Ocean-assisted “Sunday,” Earl seemingly apologizes to his neglected significant other, insisting that he’s faithful to her despite his celebrity status. The catchy chorus sees Earl lamenting his dependence on weed to fuel both his creativity and his romantic inclinations. The always astounding Ocean raps about his altercation with Chris Brown, which he hints was due to Brown using homophobic slurs against him.
The next track is the ominous and menacing “Hive,” featuring Vince Staples and Casey Veggies, which paints a dark, smog-smeared picture of life in Los Angeles: “From a city that’s recession-hit / With stress, n-ggas could flex metal with, peddle to rake pennies in,” and “Breaking news: death’s less important when the Lakers lose.” “Hive” is a standout track with decent features, though it seems that only Vince Staples is capable of keeping up with Earl’s vicious flow.
Arguably the most incredible track of the album comes next: the melancholy “Chum” addresses Earl’s return from Samoa, the traumatic childhood event of his father’s departure, and his coping with returning as a famous man to a Los Angeles that’s far from the hometown of his youth. The production, done by Christian Rich and Earl under the alias of RandomBlackDude, paints an intimate backdrop for the highly personal track.
“Sasquatch” and “Centurion” — which feature Tyler, the Creator and Vince Staples, respectively — are certainly going to be favorites for fans of Earl’s first mixtape, as both are almost absurd story-based songs with fascinatingly dark narratives that deviate briefly from the gravity of Earl’s more confessional tracks.
The latter half of the album is filled with surprises. “523” is an interesting musical interlude, followed by the brief 0:53 secondlong though head-bangable “Uncle Al.” Then comes “Guild,” a slow and seemingly marijuana-induced track featuring Mac Miller. The rest of the album features OF members Tyler, the Creator on “Whoa,” Domo Genesis on the final track, “Knight,” an awesome BADBADNOTGOOD collaboration on “Hoarse,” and, astoundingly, RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan on the incredible “Molasses.”
Thematically, Sweatshirt’s debut album is quite similar to Tyler, the Creator’s sophomore release. No longer quite the wild child behind the Earl mixtape, the 19-year-old emcee even stated on his Twitter many months ago that he expected a loss of fans to accompany his newest release. Doris is the supremely gifted Sweatshirt grappling with growing up in Los Angeles, his relationships with family, friends, his weed and cigarette habits, departure, return and reluctant stardom.
Doris is by far my favorite album in a long time, it’s just pure genius! He’s been getting great reviews and actually just did an interview breaking down Doris track by track, pretty awesome!
Pitchfork couldn’t agree more with this being the best new music from Earl Sweatshirt 
“Hive” was one of my favorite tracks off the album. The music visual was a great supplement to that dark and ominous tone he was setting. 
Couldn’t agree more. 
Solid review. I’ve been digging every minute of Doris.

Earlier this month, Time Warner Cable and CBS became embroiled in a high-stakes negotiation that resulted in CBS pulling its programming from 3 million subscribers in the Los Angeles, New York and Dallas areas. With the blackout of CBS and CBS-affiliated programming about to surpass the four-week mark this week, one of the key points of contention in this heated battle is the ability of programmers like CBS to do business with online video-on-demand services such as Netflix and Hulu.

Time Warner’s awareness of its video-on-demand competitors is telling, and raises an important question: Will cable go the way of the VHS and analog television in favor of online video services?
“There will have to be pressure on cable companies to unbundle and to provide more channels,” Katherine Bell, assistant professor of communication and media at CSU East Bay, said. “I don’t think cable companies are in imminent danger, but I do think that the landscape keeps on shifting with digital media.”
Since the company’s founding in 1997 Netflix had been a popular site for DVD delivery rentals, but its online movie streaming function catapulted it to new heights in 2007. Hulu was close behind, enabling people to watch thousands of television shows and movies for free, and other similar websites have cropped up in the wake of the pair’s success.
In May, Michael Powell, the president of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, told the Senate that Netflix is now the largest subscription video provider in the country. The 2012 Q2 earnings report of Comcast, America’s top cable provider, shows a loss of roughly 400,000 subscribers in 2012, while Netflix gained 630,000 subscribers between April and June of this year alone.
“For me, it’s kind of that I want to see what I want to see,” Bell said.
So is it time to cut the cord on cable? As of late, this question has been polarizing television lovers everywhere. Comcast’s Xfinity Double Play subscription for $89.99 a month, for instance, seems outrageous compared to Netflix’s tempting $7.99 a month. Though vastly less expensive than many cable packages, one can see how a dependence on online television providers can become costly and cumbersome.
Caitlin Plummer, a freshman majoring in print journalism feels Netflix should play a supplementary role to cable. “Netflix is great, but the selection is limited and it doesn’t add new shows to its queue each time one airs on cable,” Plummer said. “If you’re using Netflix to watch a TV show, you’re probably watching a show that has already ended [its run] anyway.”
For this reason, many believe that cable television still has as much, if not more, to offer than online alternatives.
“Netflix has some recorded TV and movies, but on the TV you have regular programs, DVR that can record programs and OnDemand,” said Mark John, a technical support representative for Comcast Xfinity.
Despite some of the aforementioned availability problems, online television provides a wide array of options and complete control over when and how to watch them. If an avid Lost fan wants to rewatch all six seasons without paying a hefty price to buy them on DVD, Netflix has him or her covered. For those looking to watch last night’s episode of New Girl, Hulu has it — and viewers can pause, fast forward and rewind it as much as they like. Television websites give viewers a power over what they watch that cable can never provide.
“There’s nothing better than binging on five episodes of your favorite sitcom, and unless you’re lucky and catch a marathon, you’re not going to find that on cable,” Plummer said. “Netflix is amazing for instant gratification because there’s no waiting for the next show to air or for the commercials to finish.”
Needless to say, there are things that Netflix and Hulu can never provide as well. The thrill of watching the Academy Awards or the Super Bowl live and in the moment is a treat only cable subscribers can enjoy, and live news broadcasts won’t be making their way to Netflix anytime soon.
Other innovators, however, are capitalizing on online television’s flaws and cementing their dominion over entertainment. Thanks to the likes of Roku and the newer Chromecast, online television viewers are no longer forced to huddle around their computers to watch their favorite shows. The brand new Google Chromecast, for example, can stream content from one’s computer onto one’s TV via Wi-Fi, no messy cords or setup required. The result: Online television now has advantages in comfort and convenience.
If one thing is certain, it’s that online options have the future on their side: ESPN, for example, is already offering WatchESPN, a live online streaming function.
Cable fans may have to face the inevitable truth that the future keeps on coming, wiping out the old and outmoded and threatening to take subscription television with it. With the Internet’s increasing involvement in most aspects of daily life, perhaps it’s more likely that cable will soon join the cassette and the VHS in the ranks of the obsolete, and society will see television customers make the switch to online viewing.

With the team’s final practice before its season opener in the books, USC head coach Lane Kiffin was asked a question that has dogged him throughout the entire preseason:
Do you know who will start at quarterback?
Up to this point, the answer to that question had always been no. But Kiffin changed his tune on Tuesday.
“Yup,” Kiffin said.
True to form, though, he refused to reveal the decision to the media on hand.
“I can’t tell you [which quarterback will start],” Kiffin said. “I’m not gonna tell you the end of the movie before you go to the movie. You’re just gonna have to watch.”
Kiffin revealed scarce details about USC’s roster or starting lineup decision’s for Thursday’s game against Hawai’i, but did announce that redshirt junior Josh Shaw and freshman Su’a Cravens will start at free and strong safety, respectively.  Kiffin refused to disclose whether or not redshirt junior strong safety Dion Bailey was injured or simply beat out by the former five-star recruit.
 
REUNITED AGAIN
For the second straight season, Kiffin will face off against his former colleague in Hawai’i head coach Norm Chow. Kiffin expects much of the same from the Chow-led Hawai’i offense.
“I’m sure they’ll take a lot of chances, just like they did last year,” Kiffin said. “They’ll be excited to play, just like everyone is in their opener. It sounds like their quarterback has been doing a good job in scrimmages. I’m sure they’ll pressure us with a lot of new players. I expect them to be very aggressive.”
In last year’s meeting between the two teams, the Trojans scored early and often en route to a 49-10 victory, with the first touchdown coming on USC’s first offensive snap.
 
ALL BUSINESS
Though the Trojans are headed for exotic Hawaii, Kiffin has stressed that luaus and beach days will not be on the agenda for his players.
“We’ve spent a lot of time with our coaches making sure they stay on top with their position groups,” Kiffin said. “This is a business trip. Our players understand that this really isn’t a vacation for them.”

Where there is progress, there is pushback. Texas demonstrated this very principle when lawmakers banned the sale of Tesla electric cars by citing a violation of dealer franchise laws. In doing so, they have effectively curbed their chances of combating global warming.
Unlike gas-operated cars, electric cars do not depend on oil. Tesla, in particular, has developed a zero emission vehicle with the charming look of a million-dollar sports car. Motor Trend named it the Car of the Year for 2013, calling it a “remarkable automobile.” Though a time existed when only celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio could afford such a beauty, the release of the Model S allowed middle-class Americans to make the switch from their quintessential Ford or Honda. It’s no wonder that the oil industry is scrambling at the sight of these vehicles.
By attacking the way in which Tesla sells their cars, Texas has found a way to halt the electric car line’s burgeoning growth. Unlike regular car companies, Tesla has eliminated the middle man. They hope to sell their cars directly to consumers, so that Tesla representatives can explain their product more thoroughly. Tesla argues that the typical car salesman is “prejudiced against electric cars,” and that this is the reason they only allow showrooms to parade their vehicles. But according to MSN, dealers feel that “the traditional franchise system benefits car buyers because it creates competition between dealerships selling similar products.”
It’s time that Texas paid more attention to the well-being of the planet than the well-being of businesses. In the name of protecting car dealerships and companies, lawmakers have fought off the electric car line, but the public cannot overlook the hidden motives.
Examining Texas’ past shows that oil companies have played their hand in orchestrating this specific scheme to eradicate Tesla from the market. According to NPR, Texas oil producers have fought several pieces of legislation aimed at helping the environment. When the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service suggested adding the dunes sagebrush lizard to the Endangered Species list, the “oil companies argued that protecting the dunes to save the lizard would halt or significantly hinder oil production.” Furthermore, an investigation by Texans of Public Justice discovered that 19 cents of every dollar spent on lobbying went to the energy and natural resources industry.
Oil companies are doing a sensational job of protecting their interests because they see Tesla as a threat to their own growth. Companies such as Tesla offer consumers an alternative that will heal instead of hurt our environment.
States such as Colorado and Virginia have begun to follow the Lone Star State’s lead. But the American people are not entirely powerless. Tesla’s website urges environmental enthusiasts in the state of Texas to help by calling their state representative or senator and “register their support” for Senate Bill 1659 and House Bill 3351, two pieces of legislation aimed at fighting these restrictions.
Only time will tell if sleek electric cars will speckle our streets, or if consumers will continue to gravitate toward cars with traditional gas engines. Until then, it is time to fight for our home — our planet — rather than the prosperity of oil tycoons.

I support the introduction of EV’s. I own a LEAF and soon realized after test driving the vehicle that this *IS* the future of automobiles. Tesla have created a superb vehicle worthy of much praise and success.
While I agree with the articles title, the reasoning is not to my taste. I believe attaching the green ‘save the planet’ moniker to EV’s both limits sales to those who are green oriented, and also risks losing the marketing message altogether if people believe that EV’s are not truly zero emission and as green as advertised. They aren’t totally green, nothing except nature is, it’s a losing argument. Attaching the green message makes EV’s a  political target, which harms their adoption rate.
I’d prefer to see the cars sold on other merits, such as superior performance, quieter, fun to drive. Appeal to the emotional reasons to buy them. That’s how they sell regular cars and beer. Why not EV’s?
@JPWhite:
Probably the difference is what humans have on their minds. Some think of themselves, of their families, and friends. Then of course it’s easier to look at electric cars as being bought by customers because of the user advantages only (financial reasons, performance, quietness etc).
Still there are some, who look beyond themselves, or the immediate circle of persons around them. There are some serious problems, and lots of human beings suffer, in the USA, as well as in other countries. Some humans have that on their minds as well.
The MIT’s Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment released a study that 53,000 early deaths are attributed to exhaust from cars and trucks, annually, in the USA. 53,000 people die unnecessarily. For some, who look further than just at themselves, that matters. Electricity generation from fossil fuels also creates pollution that can have these effects, but at least electric cars are able to be powered by renewables, many people already use the electricity from the photovoltaic panels of their own home. And as the electricity grid hopefully gets cleaned up (more and more renewables), electric cars will become greener and greener every year automatically. BTW, in United Kingdom, it’s more than 5000 deaths from car exhaust each year, in Germany, it’s more than 5000 deaths as well. So this is an international phenomenon, and that’s why it’s positive for those who care about it that more and more electric cars are being sold worldwide.
And that’s just the immediate deaths. There are so many more consequences of car pollution (along with other pollution factors). For example, there already are on average 11 days every year, where air quality in the Los Angeles area is rated flat-out „unhealthy“, according to airnow.gov. Already 12.7% of adults, and 16.1% of children in California have asthma. That bears economic consequences, as well. The health care costs because of this are enormous, and these so-called “externalities” have to be paid by everyone (all people on the same health care plan, or by the public through disability benefits etc). But those economic consequences are minor to the human lives affected by it. Imagine all the suffering, from all these people being ill, from needing health treatments, for all the rest of their lives.
And then there’s the global consequences. When human beings living f.e. on pacific islands with a maximum elevation above sea level of 12 or 18 feet have to face more and more and stronger and stronger storms to deal with, and face that eventually with the sea level rising they or their children will just lose their homes and will have to leave their drowned island forever to seek asylum somewhere else, because of the man-made effects of global warming? How must that feel, as the inhabitants of these islands often do absolutely drive no cars or have no industries, it’s not them causing the loss of their land and home, it’s because of the actions of other people on this planet? There are so many consequences, and so many concrete examples of it…
Of course nobody expects Nissan to put any of this into a Leaf ad. Human beings who don’t have anything on their mind outside their own circle of persons in their lives won’t care, and the ones who do have persons beyond themselves on their mind already know. But at least to mention it now and then, that electric cars are environmentally friendly, that should be allowed.
It’s not a losing argument. Electric cars can be cleaner than any internal combustion engine can ever be.
And it’s important to mention it. Maybe at least shortly in marketing, but longer at least in conversations outside of sales, like here. Especially for the reason in order to not dumb it down to the “I’m all about myself” world view of those who have that mindset, but in opposition to confront them at least now and then that there are other human beings as well, and that other human beings matter just as much as they do themselves as a human being, and that there are so many human beings in the world who suffer unnecessarily. One doesn’t have to be one of them or to wait until one is one of them to do something about it, let’s go ahead now and make the world a cleaner, better place for the human beings who live in it.
@kippy ohr, your diatribe is unwarranted. You specifically avoided discussing the points of the article which are clearly true. If that’s all you have, then please spare us further spittle.
The truth is that the oil industry spends millions lobbying Congress and many state houses to get laws passed that protect their interests, often at the expense of the general public. Our military spends $80 billion each year protecting access to the world’s oil. This is exclusive of wars, by the way. The Iraq war would not have been fought if Iraq had the same amount of oil as North Korea. We spent $2.1 trillion on that war, none of which you pay when you buy gas. This is due to lobbying from the oil companies.
Texas car dealers were laughing at Tesla just two years ago claiming their electric cars were “toys of the rich”. Now that Tesla has a car on the market that is the best car in history, they crying for protection and spending good money lobbying to make sure they get it. Pathetic! If they were REAL capitalists, they’d embrace the competition and build a better car, but they can’t and they won’t. They are proving to be bullies who go crying to momma when a real man punches them in the face. 
I hope Tesla kicks their butts into insolvency, the sooner the better.
I agree with this article.  Thanks for bringing this up.  Electric cars, plug-in cars, hybrids, these are the cars of the future.  We need to embrace them, not try to stay away from them.  I took a Tesla Model S for a test drive, and these are amazing cars.  if you love gadgets, sleek cars, and a roller coast ride like acceleration you should check it out.  Very cool.

What a pathetic leftist ideology this author has been addicted to…
this type of stuff does NOT belong in a place of higher learning like USC.
It is more like something that you’d see in CUBA … where everyone else is to blame for the worlds ills….
esp. the USA, rich people, white males, straight people, Texas, etc.
This kind of diatribe is so predictable of these pious, holier-than-thou lefties who “know more” than anyone else.
Seriously…talk rationally with the “other side” so that we can all understand the Truth of the matter.
But please spare us the IDEOLOGICAL garbage. We’ve ALL heard it before. It’s boring & it’s clearly not true.
Wow Kippy, what an ignorant, rambling diatribe. Have you ever driven a Tesla? Are you a Texas dealer?  Get over it.

If there’s any irony in this world, it’s that Anthony Weiner’s sexting scandals keep him, and his unfortunate last name, in the news. What’s not at all humorous, however, is the fact that he remains in the New York mayoral race, damaging his own credibility and making light of New York’s democratic process.
Emily McPeek | Daily Trojan
Weiner, who last served as a member of the House of Representatives, was forced to resign in 2011 amid a sexting scandal in which he accidentally revealed an explicit picture on his Twitter account. This private message was intended for a young woman who was not his wife. His wife, Huma Abedin, happens to be Hillary Clinton’s No. 2. In the aftermath of that scandal, under intense public scrutiny, Weiner admitted his mistake, apologized and resigned from his position. And that was the last that the public heard of him until he entered the New York City mayoral race earlier this year.
Though Weiner is not the first man to be unfaithful to his wife, his public demeanor in the face of such blatant scandal is nothing less than despicable. Instead of showing remorse and quietly retreating from the race, he chose to continue campaigning, even after another sexting scandal, this time under the alias of “Carlos Danger.”
He has attempted to downplay his transgressions, saying in a post-scandal advertisement that, “If someone wants to come out … with something embarrassing about you in your private life, you’ve got to talk about that for a little while.”
Weiner seems to be under the illusion that his campaign has suffered only a minor setback, a temporary handicap from which he will bounce back. This scandal is not just a temporary one. It’s a pattern of unabashed behavior that Weiner is clearly not at all sorry for, nor does he have the self-control to at least hide it from the public.
His poor decision-making is not what voters want in an elected public official, someone who people expect to at least be a little more careful with his or her “embarrassing” private decisions. It is irrational to expect responsible public behavior and decision-making from a man who cannot even control his private life.
The name Eliot Spitzer also comes to mind when discussing politicians from New York who have had trouble keeping their personal lives private. The former governor of New York, Spitzer was also forced to resign because of his patronage of a high-priced prostitute.
A few days after these allegations came to light, Spitzer announced his resignation and apologized. What he did not do, however, was re-enter the political field after such a high-profile scandal. He began with stints in academia, always a respectable and neutral ground. He began granting interviews with media outlets. He avoided highly controversial and partisan topics, however, telling the Washington Post, “Mistakes I made in my private life now prevent me from participating in these issues as I have in the past.” And rightly so.
Spitzer acknowledged that he had lost the trust of the public, and he took his time to rebuild his public image. He is now running for New York City’s comptroller, a lower level position than he had held before.  Unlike Weiner, who has the bravado to run for New York City mayor, Spitzer took the correct path in returning to politics. More importantly, however, Spitzer did not repeat his same mistakes. At the very least, if Spitzer has relapsed back into consorting with high-priced prostitutes, we do not know about it because it has not been exposed publicly.
This very fact has strengthened his credibility with voters. America likes redemption stories. After all, Bill Clinton remained in office, and we tend to forgive politicians and celebrities should they show the proper remorse for their actions. Weiner, however, has not done that and has not taken any convincing steps to show the public that he is truly sorry for what he has done.
New York City voters seem to be over the possibility of Weiner as mayor — his poll numbers are low (under 10 percent in most recent polling) and his campaign is running out of both money and support from public figures, especially Democrats. The only person who seems to not understand this is Weiner himself.

These people are the ones who successfully run for public office?
No wonder nobody cares about important issues like continuation of wars, declaration of a new war on Syria, our priorities in spending our own budget, healthcare, foreign policy,….etc.

A new school year means a fresh start, fresh faces, and this year at USC, fresh food. USC Hospitality is introducing some new and affordable places to eat on campus that are sure to be a hit with students of all different tastes.
Bon appetit · New dining options on campus explore the diverse array of cultures represented by the student body at USC, with options such as No Tomatoes, an Indian restaurant with on-the-go convenience. – Alegra Hueso | Daily Trojan
Returning students already know and love the popular restaurants at the Tutor Campus Center (TCC) such as Lemonade, Seeds, Panda Express and California Pizza Kitchen. Joining them is the newest member of the TCC family, Verde, a “Chipotle-esque restaurant,” according to Ron Baker, senior manager of USC Hospitality. “But we’re not Chipotle,” he said. “We’re better.” Such a forthright statement isn’t just talk; after all, there’s a USC reputation to uphold.
“What sets us apart from the rest is that we are fresh, and we pride ourselves on freshness,” said kitchen manager and chef Edward Rodriguez. “We make everything that day. We bring fresh ingredients from local places, and everything is grown here in California. For example, our tortillas are from a Los Angeles tortillería (tortilla factory) called La Fortaleza.”
The bold flavors of ancho chiles, lime, chipotle, adobo, garlic and oregano infuse the Verde menu, which includes burritos, burrito bowls, tacos and nachos, along with an abundance of fresh pico de gallo and guacamole. A variety of aguas frescas (“fresh waters” in Spanish) are also offered. “We plan on switching up the flavors every month or so,”  Rodriguez said. “Right now we’re serving cantaloupe, strawberry guava and watermelon.”
Verde can be found in the old Wahoo’s Fish Tacos location and is already a hit with students. Rachel Latterich, a sophomore majoring in Public Relations is pleased with one difference. “I love refried beans and that was the reason why I never went to Chipotle, because they didn’t have refried beans, but Verde does,” Latterich said.
Neeraj Patel, or “Raj,” as most people call him, is a USC Viterbi School of Engineering graduate who followed his passion for food. He created a name for himself as the owner of the No Tomatoes! Indian Cafe near the Beverly Center as well as the popular No Tomatoes! food truck, which serves fresh Indian food in an American to-go style. Patel has partnered with USC Hospitality to open a second No Tomatoes!, fittingly located within his old stomping grounds, the Viterbi School of Engineering’s Ronald Tutor Hall.
“USC has given me a great opportunity and a great education,” Patel said. “I’m following my passion while still doing my regular job [as an engineer], and I think that this is a great opportunity for me to give back to the community and to the school that has given me so much.”
The No Tomatoes! Cafe will offer such classic Indian dishes as spinach chana, crunchy potato and pea samosas, and savory chicken vindaloo.
Director of USC Hospitality Kris Klinger said the new food options are also a reflection of the cultural diversity of its student body.
“Ultimately, the goal of USC Hospitality is to provide for the students no matter what their ethnicity or background,” Klinger said. “Bringing the foods to USC that students would normally eat at home creates a safer and familiar environment for students as well as benefitting the school.”
Aiming to please the customer and serve up the most authentic cuisine on campus, Tutor Hall Cafe has introduced a Southeast Asian-inspired bistro, adjacent to No Tomatoes! This part of the cafe serves up five types of ramen, such as vegetable, shrimp and Thai beef as well as Southeast Asian inspired salads. Executive Chef Eric Ernest and his team will also be rolling out a Los Angeles-area favorite: the bahn mi.
“[Bahn mi] are cuts of chicken, pork or beef on a baguette, mostly inspired from Vietnam and Morocco because of all the French outposts there,” Ernest said. “It’s kind of like a French-meets-Southeast Asian sandwich that is nice and flat, with thin cut meat and vegetables.”
USC Hospitality doesn’t stop there. In order to put the icing on the cake and add a cherry on top, Traditions and Tommy’s Place, the designated “pubs” on campus, according to USC Hospitality, have undergone renovations and are about to be the most happening spots for student nightlife on campus. Traditions or “Traddies,” has always been perfect for fun date nights, guys’ or girls’ nights out, and especially music performances and USC football.
Traditions’ menu now serves Big Country barbecue, a southern inspired classic barbecue joint with all the fixings. The restaurant promises to provide the best barbecue in the West with a signature sriracha-lime aioli sauce, perfect for the hand-breaded chicken tenders, and the Korean BBQ sauce made for the tender half-rack crispy spare ribs called “The Sidekick.” Make sure to plan ahead for the designated daily specials, like the campus favorite chicken and waffles sandwich that is available on Thursdays, and the 50-cent Wing Nights perfect for Monday Night Football. Wednesday is also Trivia Night at Tommy’s Place on Wednesdays from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.
Students will be pleased with the vast array of new on-campus dining options, and should take the opportunity afforded to them to try something new and exciting.
