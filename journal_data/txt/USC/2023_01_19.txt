Every night, I look forward to the release of the latest episode of my favorite webtoons. It’s a routine that gets me through each day. Whenever I want to take a break between assignments, I turn to webtoons, wanting to know what happens next to the woman who has been transmigrated into a romance novel or the unravelings of a conspiracy. 
For those who aren’t familiar with webtoons, Regina Kim at “TIME Magazine” describes them as “a type of digital comics optimized to be read on mobile devices.” The medium has become popularized thanks to the South Korean companies that have published them and contributed to their growth. Yet, while webtoons are associated with South Korean culture, the nature of their popularity is global. 
Readers can read webtoons from locations around the world, and creators can upload their own webtoons to accessible digital platforms as well. As Kim mentions, webtoons have also become an incredibly rich source for entertainment. 
Just the other day, I started watching “Lookism,” the recently released Netflix animated series based on a webtoon. Centered on a bullied boy who is able to transform into a conventionally attractive student at certain times, the storyline offers an important message about how we treat and judge others based on superficial factors. 
Despite the relevance of its message, I didn’t end up finishing “Lookism,” mostly because I felt it started to drag in later episodes. While “Lookism” may not have been worth my time, I was able to learn from that experience. My takeaway was that webtoons have so much power and possibilities for adaptation. The evidence? All of the popular K-drama adaptations of webtoons that currently exist: “A Business Proposal,” “What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim?” and more. 
More personally, webtoons can be a form of escapism, especially for those who want to temporarily consume fiction without delving too deeply. The episodic format is easily engaging, with one or two episodes fitting neatly into an occasional study break. 
Of all the different webtoon platforms out there, the one I use the most is Manta. It’s the most optimal for my budget, as you can access all the episodes and webcomics available on the app for a small monthly subscription fee of $4.99. I’ve found this business model more cost-effective for me dabbling in different genres (which I prefer over purchasing to read selected episodes, as is the system for some other webtoon platforms). 
For those who are just getting into webtoons but don’t know where to start, I highly recommend Manta to sample a wide variety. If you don’t know where to start, I’ve listed a couple of my favorites below: 
Finding Camellia
Think “Mulan,” but if the tale was transplanted into a historical French-esque setting, complete with beautiful ballgowns and political turmoil. This webtoon centers on Camellia, a young girl who is forced to live as a boy in an aristocratic family after the only son of the family becomes ill. Wanting to preserve the family’s power and lineage, the matriarch abducts Camellia to live as “Camellius,” a son of the family — and another possible heir. Having just finished its first season, “Finding Camellia” is an adaptation of the digital novel of the same name. It’s a thrilling webtoon about what it means to find your true self in a world where your identity has been suppressed.
Check In to My Heart
In typical rom-com fashion, Ajin, the intern at the hotel and Seolmin, the hotel’s CEO, make an agreement to help each other: her with his pursuit of a beautiful hotel employee and him to let her live in his hotel. Although the webtoon’s not yet completed, the often awkward interactions between the two have already foreshadowed the burgeoning romance. It’s a satisfying buildup, and the trope of contractual obligations is nearly always a great one.
The Stairway of Time
This webtoon is my absolute favorite of all the completed webtoons currently available on Manta. Yuna can’t forget her past love in high school, Jihoon, who died in a tragic accident. When she’s given the opportunity to travel back in time through a stairway in the school, Yuna resolves to save Jihoon and correct the mistakes of the past. This is a tearjerker with a premise reminiscent of hit Taiwanese drama “Someday or One Day” that teaches audiences about valuing the past in determining one’s future. 
These are just a few of the webtoons I’ve found to “illustrate” the powers of visual storytelling. Whatever genre you like, I’d say that there’s a webtoon for everyone — why not enjoy the scroll?

Being a USC student is expensive. The astronomical tuition expenses aside, rent, utilities and Trader Joe’s snacks add up really fast. With money consistently flowing out of your bank account, what can you do for fun? 
There is no shortage of excitement on campus. Still, it can be nice to leave the bubble and explore the city. One way to do that is by visiting the countless museums around Los Angeles. While some, such as the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, will require a hefty $25 entrance fee, don’t let that scare you away from other museums, as being a USC student comes with a very special gift: your USC ID. 
The ID will get you into most museums free of charge. It even lowers that $25 for the Academy Museum down to a more reasonable $15. Still, why spend that when you have the magical key to spend nothing? Before the multitude of possibilities become too overwhelming, here is a list of the greatest free-for-student museums and their most exciting exhibits. 
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
Usually $12 for students, Trojans have the opportunity to get up close and personal with fossils for free. Even better, there is no transportation required, as the museum is located in Exposition Garden.
The Natural History Museum has something for everyone. Explore the Jane G. Pisano Dinosaur Hall and see the mounted skeletons of 20 different dinosaurs, including three of a Tyrannosaurus rex — one baby, one juvenile and one grown. 
“L.A. Underwater” is one of the museum’s current featured exhibits, exploring “the prehistoric sea beneath us” — as the gallery displays, the city that Trojans call home used to live underneath the Pacific Ocean. The exhibit features 40 prehistoric fossils including a shark that the museum notes was bigger than a city bus — something fun to think about next time you take a trip to the beach. 
Also, the gardens maintained outside the museum are a treat for any nature lover, and a great escape for when campus feels claustrophobic.
The Broad
The Broad is free to everyone, so you may feel slightly less special. But, at the end of the day, free is free. 
The Broad is a contemporary art museum — featuring work from the 1950s to today. With almost 2,000 pieces of art on view, it is impossible to appreciate every piece in the way it should be. 
The “Expansive Presentation of Jean Michel-Basquiat” is a wonderful place to start. Featuring 13 of Basquiat’s pieces, including “Santo 2” (1982) and “Pink Devil” (1984). The Broad is the place to see the frenzied, chaotic work of the late neo-expressionist artist. Being Haitian and Puerto Rican, Basquiat dealt with a lot of discrimination in the exclusive world of art. His work highlights Black artistry while creating a distinctive style that only belongs to him. The grafitti-like nature of his work is striking, and the complex nature of his compositions create layers of meaning for the audience to interpret. Basquiat is an important player of contemporary art. With an impressive collection of his work just a drive away, The Broad provides students the opportunity to observe the work of a genius.
Public Art
If none of those intrigue you, or you just want some fresh air, L.A. is ripe with public art. Other choices can be found in the murals that are abundant across the city. While Instagrammable angel wings are nice, there is so much more available. Public art gives a true view of the city; it’s made in L.A. for L.A.
“The History of California,” more commonly referred to as “The Great Wall of Los Angeles” by Judith Baca, is the longest mural in the world. Located in North Hollywood, it’s a bit more of a trip to get here than the other spots on this list, but it is well worth it. The mural depicts the history of California from the prehistoric age all the way to the 1984 Summer Olympics in L.A. The mural focuses on the stories from marginalized perspectives, an important rewriting of an often whitewashed history of one of the most diverse cities in the U.S. 
Living in a city with 93 museums, this list barely scratches the surface. Even if none of these options interest you, take this as a sign to take that ID card for a spin and appreciate some art or learn something new.

When you’re a kid, you’re taught not to draw on the walls; it’s considered taboo, immature and unacceptable. However, the Wall Drawing Invitational, open to the public on Jan. 19, allowed the Roski community to do just that. The collaborative mural spans all four walls of the USC Roski Studios Building IFT gallery and spills onto various dividers donated by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). 
Roski students, faculty, staff and alumni came together to draw on the gallery walls over the course of four days. Their instructions were to “creatively graffiti” however they wanted, allowing the Roski community free range over the blank, white canvas of the IFT gallery. Roski Chair of 2D Art Edgar Arceneaux described the inspiration behind the Wall Drawing Invitational. 
“This show is an opportunity for us to reconnect with the most primal part of being a creative person, which is just to make a mark,” Arceneaux said. “And sometimes that’s on the walls. I really wanted to open it up to people’s abilities without the exclusiveness that sometimes happens with a curated show.”
Makayla Howard, a senior majoring in fine arts, coordinated the project. She explained that the open-ended nature of the Wall Drawing Invitational not only encourages innovation and expression, but also combats the often elitist restrictions on creating art. 
“There is a taboo about drawing on the walls and just something really anarchist about it,” Howard said. “We’re stepping off of the paper and the canvas that we’re used to and seeing what we can make outside of that.”
Howard also spoke to the difficulty of wanting to experiment with art in an academically rigorous environment like USC.
“When you go to USC and it’s a very academic-based school, not a lot of people want you to be an artist or show that creative side of yourself,” Howard said. “That’s a part of it also, coming together as a group of creatives and saying, ‘we’re going to do it anyways.’”
Arceneaux explained that the goal of the mural is to foster inclusive, large-scale collaboration in a traditional gallery space.
“Somebody could’ve left a drawing behind, and you could draw something next to it and add to it, or you could draw over it entirely, and it’ll disappear,” Arceneaux said. “Or you can come in here with somebody you don’t know and draw next to them, and then decide that you want to connect together. There’s a lot of rich opportunities for community-building.”
The spirit of collaboration is imbued in the very essence of the Wall Drawing Invitational. In fact, when I arrived at the gallery on Jan. 11 to interview Arceneaux and Howard for the Daily Trojan, one of the first things Arceneaux asked me to do was assist with moving the LACMA dividers. Then I helped roll out butcher paper and rearrange the table of art materials in the center. When I revisited the space on Jan. 17, that same spirit was in full swing: Professor Ruby Osorio’s Painting I class inhabited the gallery, trading chalk pastels and admiring each other’s graffiti. 
Wilha Duncan, a freshman majoring in art and a student in Osorio’s class, based her contribution to the mural off of another illustration she noticed on the gallery walls. 
“I saw someone else draw a big fish on the wall and it really inspired me because I love fish. They’re maybe my favorite thing to draw, so I put a fish sitting in a chair,” Duncan said. “Everybody’s drawing their own different thing and it’s big and it’s beautiful. You can see into everybody’s head.”
After a week of being open to the public, there will be a party to whitewash the walls and cover up the mural on Jan. 25. The walls may be repainted, but Arceneaux and Howard’s message will stay the same: creating art in a gallery should be open to everyone, anywhere. The Wall Drawing Invitational is one step towards making art accessible to all. 
“When you think of empty white walls in a gallery space, it does evoke some type of privilege and exclusivity,” Howard said. “I think that this will help artists see their work in spaces like that. It’s important to be able to come into a gallery space with these white walls and decide, ‘I’m gonna do what I want on it.’ That alone, that action is really powerful.”
The Wall Drawing Invitational is open to the public from Jan. 19-25 at the USC Roski Studios Building IFT gallery, 3001 S. Flower Street.

A cheaper DoorDash is coming to USC.
DoorDash announced its new DashPass for Students Plan, which, at $4.99 a month, would present a “wallet-friendly option for students to get whatever they desire delivered on-demand from thousands of eligible restaurants, convenience and grocery stores, and other retailers on DoorDash,” the company wrote in its announcement released April 11. 
CJ Hunter and Owen Engling, campus ambassadors for the food delivery platform, say the initiative would make food and item delivery more affordable and convenient for students.
Hunter, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said he believes there is a lot for students to take advantage of with DashPass.
“What we’re trying to do is give college students the convenience of a delivery service without all the high fees you see with Grubhub and Uber Eats,” Hunter said. “The membership [fee] pays for itself in one order.”
Hunter said he is “trying to gauge what restaurants and organizations students really interact with on a daily basis,” such as Spudnuts, Chick-fil-A and Domino’s Pizza, and adding them as eligible purchases under the service.
“If students want more restaurants on the platform, they can reach out to me or the other [ambassador],” Hunter said.
Engling, a senior majoring in human biology and health and the human sciences, said DashPass services extend beyond food delivery, reflecting the breadth of available items on DoorDash.
“I think a lot of people just think it’s for delivering restaurants to your home, but we do groceries. We do small items,” Engling said. “Anything you can get at a common store would be on the app.”
Danielle Shakib, a senior majoring in business administration, said that DashPass could mitigate the extensive cost of food delivery, otherwise a safer alternative than going in person to a restaurant late at night. Shakib had previously shied away from the service because of the expense.
“[The cost] just starts to add up, and it’s unrealistic,” Shakib said. “If I was going to order DoorDash and my friend was going to come over, I’m like, ‘Let’s just go get the food.’” 
With DashPass, however, Shakib said she could envision herself spending within her personal budget.
“The whole intention [of DoorDash] is to make your life easier,” Shakib said. “Obviously, it’s at a really high cost now, so if you can bring that down, I feel like they’re just going to have better retention rates, consumers will be happier and it also helps them with competition [against] Postmates or Uber Eats.”
Engling said ambassadors would be promoting the student DashPass at pop-ups and sponsored events on campus, hoping to engage students in the service — with a $10 gift card promotional offer for those who sign up and $48 annual subscriptions — and seek their feedback on ways to improve the platform.
“We’ll [also] be going around to different clubs and organizations on campus to talk to people and letting them know that this exists,” Engling said. “We’ll be trying as many different ways to get involved with students as possible.”

USC fielded a skeleton crew at the Cougar Classic last Friday, but seemingly secured enough hardware for two or three full rosters in the season’s first indoor meet.
A good summary of the day might’ve been the men’s 4x400m.
Freshmen Justin Braun and William Jones set their blocks in lanes two and five respectively, representing Trojan “A” and “B” squads; Washington State and Idaho took their marks between USC in three and four — call it a Trojan sandwich.
The gun. A blink. And Braun had already made up the stagger on Washington State, hunting down Idaho too by the second turn on the 200m track. Washington State’s runner hobbled off, presumably on account of injury.
Still, it wasn’t yet obvious that it’d be smooth sailing for the Trojans when Idaho beat Jones to the break. But Jones, the Kansas high school 400m record holder, put any doubts to bed by coming back at the 250m mark with his signature limbs-and-hair-flailing stride.
Braun, handing off to senior Nicholas Ramey, split something akin to a 46-low. Jones followed a second later with his handoff to junior Ashton Allen, the two veterans putting more distance on Idaho but leaving the gap between Trojan squads relatively untouched — both running something in the 46 second neighborhood, leaving team “B” ahead of “A.”
The relay’s most gallant runner might’ve been freshman Tamaal Myers, who ran down sophomore Baylor transfer Johnny Brackins Jr. in another roughly 46 second split that effectively closed the gap between Trojan teams.
Idaho didn’t field a fourth leg, leaving graduate Cincinnati transfer Chris Borzor running on the outside shoulder of freshman Max Thomas in a USC-USC deadlock. Borzor managed to eke out a win for team “A” over his freshman counterpart on the final straightaway; the “A” squad ran a 3:10.16, and “B” a 3:10.39.
It was a good day to be a Trojan. USC, one of seven schools competing in the meet, took first place in 10 of the 25 events. USC’s four 4x400m teams — “A” and “B” for both men and women — all broke the previous venue records.
Junior Summer Mosley’s 19.43m weight throw broke her own previous school record. Senior Tade Ojora won the men’s 60m hurdles in a 7.68 second personal best, moving him to second on USC’s all-time performance list for that event.
USC swept the first four places in the men’s 400m, granted the only competition was two Montana State runners. Jones, the freshman, finished in second place with a 47.50 that put him behind Allen — but ahead of two of his upperclassman counterparts.
Thomas, also a freshman, came second only to Oregon sophomore Micah Williams in the 60m finals. Williams, who ran on Team USA’s 4x100m relay team in the Tokyo Olympics, was last year’s NCAA indoor 60m champion.
Other standout performances were junior Jan’Taijah Jones’ first-place 53.63 400m, followed by fellow junior Kimberly Harris in second with a 53.85. 
And it wasn’t just the power events: The women’s distance squad got a confidence boost of its own, showing its strength over middle distance after a lukewarm cross country season. 
Sophomore Gigi Maccagnini won the mile, looking composed throughout her 4:56.09; freshman Ashlee Gallegos followed in second place with a 5:06.45. Senior Janiah Brown, running in a three-person race, took first in the 800m with a 2:12.67 — beating out the second-place runner by some 13 seconds, a huge margin in a half-mile contest.
The Trojans compete next Saturday at the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Collegiate Invitational in Albuquerque.

After two comfortable home wins against Colorado and Utah, the USC men’s basketball team have turned their eyes towards the desert. The Trojans will play No. 11 Arizona Thursday night, quickly followed by a game against Arizona State on Saturday.
Size has been an issue for USC all season and it will be no different on Thursday. Arizona has two of the best bigs in the country with 6-foot-11-inch forward Azuolas Tubelis and 7-foot  center Oumar Ballo, who both weigh over 240 pounds. Tubelis averages 20.4 PPG while Ballo is more of a rebounding threat, averaging 9.1 RPG.
“Ballo is physical and athletic and runs the floor very hard,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Tubelis, not only is he big and strong, but he’s also very skilled. He can step back and drive the ball and is also a very good passer.”
Enfield mentioned the team will have to rely heavily on their own centers and forwards to stop Arizona’s top two scorers from dominating the game. Redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan will be tasked with guarding one of the two Arizona big men, but emphasized it will be a team effort.
“It’s going to be a team guard,” Morgan said. “They got two [big men], so it’s not just going to be me, it’s a team guard, regarding both of them.”
Enfield emphasized the Trojans have players capable of guarding Tubelis and Ballo, pointing out their other four forwards on the roster besides Morgan: sophomore Harrison Hornery, freshman Kijani Wright, freshman Iaroslav Niagu and freshman Vincent Iwuchukwu.
The Trojans have used the same starting lineup of Morgan and four guards in every game since they debuted the lineup against UC Berkeley on Nov. 30. Enfield did not say whether he would change his starting lineup for this game, particularly since fifth-year guard Drew Peterson is 6 feet 9 inches tall and can guard Arizona’s other post player. 
However, Enfield will have to turn to more size off the bench to account for the height and weight advantage that Arizona has.
Despite the fact Arizona is ranked No. 11 in the country, they have appeared vulnerable recently, losing two of their last three games against Pac-12 opponents. Most recently, Oregon beat Arizona in blowout fashion 87-68 on Jan. 14 in Eugene. 
The Trojans have tried to pay attention to their own game rather than focusing on how their opponents are playing though.
“We don’t look at what other teams do,” Enfield said. “Arizona is one of the hardest places to play in the country. We get confidence from how we play and how we practice.”
Since USC has such a young team, the Arizona environment will be a test for the Trojans, given that the McKale Memorial Center has averaged 13,713 fans per game this season. In comparison, Galen Center has only averaged 2,451 fans per game this season.
Morgan believes the five true freshmen on the team will just have to learn on the go in the hostile road environment.
“There’s not a very good way to prepare them, it’s really more of an ‘into the fire’ type of thing,” Morgan said. “I just gotta tell them the same thing I told them before they played their first home games. You’ve just got to calm down.” 
Even though Arizona will be a tall task for the Trojans, they still have to prepare for their game against Arizona State, which is only two days after the Trojans tussle with the Wildcats.
“We go into every game with the same amount of preparation, same amount of intensity,” Morgan said. “So even if we win [against Arizona], we’re not going to take a game off just because they might not be ranked. They’re still pretty high up in the Pac-12, and we need this win either way. So we’re not going to overlook any teams.”
As it stands, ASU has the second-best record in Pac-12 play behind UCLA. UCLA and ASU play each other on Thursday, so USC, who currently sits at third in the Pac-12, has the chance to jump over ASU in the standings if they play well and win this weekend.
ASU boasts a balanced attack, as they have four players who have played at least ten games and average 10 PPG or more. They do not pose the same size issue as Arizona, but the Trojans will have to defend well across the board to be able to win the game.
These two upcoming games are of the utmost importance for the Trojans and may define their season. USC will meet the Arizona teams again later in the season, but they must play well this weekend to keep their March Madness hopes alive.
The Trojans will take on Arizona at McKale Center Thursday at 6 p.m. and then will head to Desert Financial Arena on Saturday to face Arizona State at 7 p.m.

The house is decorated in various yellows and reds — from flowers to tablecloths to the cups on my grandparents’ altar. Between the firecrackers thundering outside and the screaming and shouting from my family members playing in the bầu cua cá cọp gambling match, I could barely hear my thoughts. My olfactory neurons are working overtime with the warm piquant smell of the incense burning and the rich, familiar aromas drifting out from the kitchen. Fighting every impulse not to shove all the food on the table into my mouth, I was overstimulated with everything around me.
But I was never overwhelmed.
As I close my eyes, I can vividly remember what Lunar New Year sounded like, smelled like, looked like, tasted like, felt like — all my senses fire up as I try to travel back to the good old days.
I’m not sure when everything changed. Suddenly, the weeks-long celebration was just a weekend and the commanding stimuli I received around this time of the year quieted down to just a whisper. So quiet that I hadn’t noticed the holiday had passed.
The Vietnamese New Year celebration consists of 12 days, each dedicated to a specific task or person. 12 days of warmth, smiles, lion dancing, gambling, family and fond memories. So, when I say that it shrunk down to just 1-2 days of festivities to none, it makes my heart sink like an anchor through a frozen lake.
Last year, I swept through the kitchen on the first of February casually with the broom until I crumpled to the dusty floor when I remembered what Feb. 1 meant: the New Year. For some context, growing up it was embedded in me by all my aunties and uncles that bad luck clings to the dust and dirt around you, but as you enter the new year, luck reenters your home. And I had just swept all of the luck out of my apartment.
Now, do I really blame all the traumatic experiences and the hell that was 2022 on my decision to sweep my crumb-filled kitchen floors? Maybe. 
But it wasn’t just the loss of luck that hurt, it was everything. How could I have forgotten? Even though the celebrations shrunk to just a weekend after my dad died, it was still celebrated. I had always celebrated, no matter rain or shine.
I think it was the one thing I felt still connected me to all those before me and all those currently with me in my community. Coming from a family full of immigrants, finding any form of common ground is a Sisyphean task. Despite all of the differences between my mom and I, it was something we could celebrate together. Superstitions put aside, forgetting Lunar New Year was synonymous with forgetting to honor my family and ancestors.
It’s hard to say the least, to feel connected to your family and culture when it feels like everything you do goes against their old-fashioned (slightly outdated) beliefs. But on Lunar New Year, none of that matters. The giant red booming firecrackers scare all evil spirits and muffle our differences as the sticky rice cakes and braised pork bring the family together to the table. Memories of the nagging and strictness that suffocates me pause as I find myself gambling away my red envelope money and screaming playfully with my mom when my brother ends up taking all our money.
It’s strange to say that this time of year brings melancholy feelings when for most of my life, it was the time of the year I cherished the most. So this year, in an attempt to scare away the melancholy like the firecrackers did years before, I sat down and wrote this article. Putting my emotions into words always took a weight off my chest. But in addition to that, I called up my relatives and lived vicariously through them as I asked them about their New Year plans.
I know that 12 days of Lunar New Year celebration shouldn’t be the only thing that brings family together, but at the moment it’s a path I’m familiar with that I feel comfortable enough to go on. What does that entail? Well, it starts off with me recruiting my roommates to deep clean our house before the New Year to prevent the 2022 fiasco. Then, it involves me making a “small” trip to IKEA and Chinatown for Lunar New Year supplies and decorations. Finally, it involves me figuring out a new way to celebrate the new year with the people currently around me while honoring those that are miles away from me.
Not celebrating the new year with my family makes my heart ache a little. Still, I want to put the melancholy behind me, forgive old grievances — even if it’s just for a few days — and create new memories in honor of the ones that continue to connect me to my family. I’d forgotten once, but those memories remind me that the new year will come once again. It’s just up to me to make it mean something.
My house is in the process of being decorated in various yellows and reds. Firecrackers live inside party poppers and screaming and shouting will most definitely come to life when I introduce my friends and roommates to bầu cua cá cọp. The kitchen might smell like smoke as I try to recreate familiar Viet dishes but just the thought of celebrating the new year in a new way makes all my senses fire up again and warm my heart once more.

On Dec. 9, my roommate and I queued up “SOS,” at 9 p.m. sharp. I bopped my head and scrolled through Twitter to see reactionary tweets, thoroughly enjoying the melodic chorus of the second track on the album and SZA’s soft yet sultry rasp. As I jammed out, inattentive and unbothered, my roommate inquired, “Do you hear what she’s saying?”
Dec. 9, 2022 marked the momentous day when, at long last, SZA dropped her long awaited sophomore studio album, “SOS,” five years after the release of her critically acclaimed debut “Ctrl.” Unsurprisingly, the album has remained No. 1 for four consecutive weeks, and has become critically acclaimed for its refusal to adhere to genre and lyrical content that is relatable to any and all who have been through some stage of heartbreak. Yet no song, through virality or impact, has permeated as deeply as “Kill Bill.” The song, one that pays obvious homage to the titular Quentin Tarantino film, contains starkly violent lyrics. Over the course of the song, SZA contemplates the homicide of her ex, before finally killing him, which is visually played out in the music video that was released on Jan. 10. 
While listeners may be jarred by the lyrical content of “Kill Bill,” violence in music is far from novel. It is extremely prevalent, and often sexist, particularly in lyrics recorded by male artists. Kanye West, one of the most problematic yet most streamed artists of all time, has continuously perpetuated violence and misogyny in his lyrics and music videos. From the music video for the song “Eazy” that depicts West murdering an effigy of Pete Davidson, his ex-wife’s partner at the time, to the song literally titled “I Thought About Killing You” off of “Ye,” he lashes out with wishes of committing acts of violence towards women he wishes to possess. All the while, of course, claiming, “You’d only care enough to kill somebody you love.”
West is far from alone. Various cultural analyses have found that, depending on subgenre, anywhere from 22% to 37% of rap lyrics contain some sort of misogyny. While some may argue that these are simply lyrics that don’t often contain truths of violence, the ripple effects are undeniable. Just this past month, Tory Lanez was finally convicted and sentenced for shooting Megan Thee Stallion in 2020, a decision that was in contention by a disturbingly high number of people. These individuals varied from Lanez’s family to Drake calling Megan a liar in his lyrics to thousands of Lanez’s fans, with over 50,000 individuals signing a petition to appeal his sentence. 
It is one thing to exaggerate lyrics, and understand that songs should not necessarily be taken as truths. Recent trials against rappers Gunna, Young Thug and other members of YSL Records have echoed historically racist persecutions of rappers of color for “violent” rap lyrics. Yet still, while the lyrics might not be meant to be taken literally, messages in media have the power to permeate our brainwaves. 
The mass distribution of violence towards women has undeniable effects. We are almost taught to expect it, to fetishize violence, and to accept it as love. As SZA sings, “I love when you pull your gun at the red light / I like all that violence, give me dysfunction,” and “‘Causey past can’t escape me / My pussy precedes me,” on “Blind,” she describes how comfortable we have become with broken love and casual toxic masculinity. Yet through “Kill Bill,” she acknowledges her power, and the tropes that often dominate controlling, abusive relationships, referencing “crimes of passion” and killing her ex’s new partner, all the while circling back to West’s argument, that “I did it all for love,” because “I’d rather be in Hell than alone.”
SZA, by flipping sexist cliches on their head, has reclaimed the narratives of misogyny that permeate the often male dominated genres of rap and R&B.
