Over-consumption seems to be a common theme in every college student’s life. Typical binges consist of pizza, cold brews and lots of ice cream while watching excessive amounts of Netflix. My overconsumption similarly consists of carbs, lots and lots of carbs.

I recently consumed enough bread to feed a small village, and let me be the first to tell you, that this is not something I am proud of. I would like to rectify my actions by saying that I was very hungry and the bread was fresh out of the oven, but that does not negate the amount that I ate.
That being said, here are a few of the best bread bakeries in Los Angeles, brought to you with the help of the Los Angeles Times and LA Weekly. Enjoy.
Bottega Louie
I refuse to be judged for including this DTLA favorite. Bottega Louie is undoubtedly a USC student favorite. I’d be willing to bet that a large portion of their profit comes from Trojan bank accounts. How do I know this? Check your Instagram and I’m sure you’ll find at least one picture of a macaron or at least the lovely French decor.
According to the Los Angeles Times, “It’s the fabulous display and packaging that makes Bottega Louie’s wide selection of pastries worth checking out even if, say, the macarons do not happen to be your favorite. Tiny tartlets, individual layer cakes and napoleons, éclairs, beignets … Everyone stops to stare, or drool.”
The Bread Lounge
Foodie hipsters are aware that this is a great place to go for some great fresh bread; you know where the ingredients are from and where the food was made. This joint may be called a bread lounge but it could more appropriately be referred to as a “bread farm” or “a carb lovers paradise.”
According to their website, “all bread and pastries are baked on-site daily.”
In the evening, watch their bakers prepare the bread for the following day.
BreadBar
The name of this eatery should be appeal enough, the combination of two awesome college kid favorites: bread and bars. What’s not to love? Not only is this joint a fab bakery, but they have a restaurant and a yummy set of snacks on their menu. They also have a happy hour, where consuming the garlic ginger fries is a must, as well as their shishito pepper and edamame beans – I go for the creative parts of menus.
LA Weekly says the best bet is a standard baguette: “Eat one end in the car, while driving home. Sandwiches for dinner. Tomorrow, make croutons. The following day, use as a club or feed to pigeons.”

This weekend will see a slew of new releases, all targeting different markets, but none of them should be major players. Instead, expect the top box office spot to be another battle between Rio 2 and Captain American: Winter Soldier.
The biggest weekend release is Transcendence, starring Johnny Depp. Regardless of a strong cast including the likes of Morgan Freeman and Kate Mara, the film’s poor reviews may turn away potential viewers. Coming from the mind of Wally Pfister, the Academy Award-winning cinematographer known for his work with Christopher Nolan on the Dark Knight trilogy and Inception, the film has a distinct visual style that will appeal to more avid moviegoers. It will, however, likely underperform this weekend.
A Haunted House 2, the comedy-horror film starring Marlon Wayans, looks to cash in on the Scary Movie franchise formula from a number of years ago. While the first film was critically panned, the signature humor of the Wayans family has been able to entertain audiences and has had decent box office numbers. This film will likely be less popular than the first one, but fans of the Wayans should find this an entertaining film to watch this weekend.
After a limited release this Wednesday, Christian film Heaven is for Real will see a wide release this weekend. Based on the No. 1 New York Times best-selling book of the same name, it tells the story of a boy who claims to have seen Heaven.  For whatever reason, 2014 is the year of the religious film, and the original story was insanely popular when it first came out. The film should see a fairly sizeable niche audience in an older religious demographic, but it should not take a significant place in the box office.
Disneynature’s newest documentary, Bears, should pull a decent audience, especially families, thanks to John C. Reilly’s narration and its timely release just a few days before Earth Day. But, as is the nature of a nature documentary, the film will not likely garner any substantial numbers in comparison to this weekend’s feature films.
The top spot this weekend should be another battle between Rio 2 and Captain America: Winter Soldier. In its third week, however, the Marvel film should slow down enough to allow Rio 2 to take the lead. Transcendence is the only new release that might give either a run for its money, but don’t expect it to take the top spot.
