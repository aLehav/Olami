Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences administrators emphasized Thursday the importance of the sessions the will hold to discuss needed changes to USC culture at the third of eight town hall.  Findings of personal values, current culture values and desired culture values by faculty, staff and students were discussed following the release of results from the USC Values Poll administered last Fall. 
More than 50 attendees learned about the experiences of the Dornsife community as reflected in the poll. 
The poll was administered to find out what the USC community wanted to improve regarding the University’s culture. With approximately 20,000 participants across staff, faculty and students, the poll garnered a 27.4% participation rate. Specifically for Dornsife, there was a 24% participation rate.
The University’s Culture Journey is in partnership with 1-degree, an experienced Barrett Values Centre that created the poll and helps organizations build and sustain values-driven culture. The process consists of the poll, reportings through Town Hall meetings and discussion sessions.
According to the USC Values Poll, the University’s current cultural entropy, which represents the amount of energy consumed in unproductive work, is 28%. From this assessment, USC is categorized as facing “significant issues,” which means there are issues that require attention and systems that need exploration. 
Kimberly Freeman, the associate dean and chief diversity officer at Dornsife, said the results of the poll would help identify the key areas that the school needs to improve on and help in bringing the right support to different communities on campus.
“I look toward the data that’s telling me what’s happening for communities that are marginalized,” Freeman said. “There’s opportunities to really understand [what] members within the gender categories are experiencing not only in their immediate environment but at USC as a whole.”
Freeman said releasing the poll’s results and gaining knowledge of community values was essential to Dornsife’s mission as a liberal arts college that centers its research around values. 
“We have world-class research in social sciences and natural sciences and humanities and so we create a lot of the content that eventually shows up in this kind of work around values,” Freeman said. “So I see an alignment with what we fundamentally do as a liberal arts college.”
Carol Faull, a senior consultant with 1-degree, has been working with USC since August to identify the current experience, build the aspired culture and train USC facilitators. Faull said the company wanted to increase transparency by sharing results in a town hall format, both at the University and individual college level.
“We heard in the past that for surveys that had been conducted … people never heard the results,” Faull said. “So we were committed through the working groups to transparency.”
Faull said results showed that five of the top 10 values that were selected for desired culture, including communication, ethical and transparency,  were shared by staff, faculty and students, serving as a starting point for conversations and deciding values the University wants to build.  
“It’s not that we have a list of 100 things to chase,” Faull said. “If we solely focused on those top five, we would have some really rich conversations and be able to shape the core unifying values that will take this university forward, as well as how we define that.”  
Discussion sessions to talk about the poll and its results will be held over the coming weeks with separate sessions for students, faculty and staff. The goal of the sessions is to collectively redefine the values of the University, according to Freeman.
“It’s not intended to be a destination, it’s a journey,” Freeman said. “So I think we need to remind people that we are just beginning.”

Homelessness is a significant issue among California voters leading up to the March primary election, according to a poll USC released at a Thursday event hosted by USC Schwarzenegger Institute and the Sol Price Center for Social Innovation. A panel of past and present government officials also spoke on the state of homelessness in California at Town and Gown during the event. 
More than 150 students attended “Unhoused: Addressing Homelessness in California,” which included input from Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson regarding potential solutions to homelessness and public perceptions of the housing crisis in California. 
According to poll results, more than a quarter of voters know individuals who have personally experienced homelessness and felt the need for a combination of stricter restrictions and compassionate policies. 
“There are lots of people in the state who are impacted by homelessness … or are afraid that they could become homeless themselves,” Academic Director of the Schwarzenegger Institute Christian Grose said. “There’s a lot of inconsistency in attitudes about policies where people favor some sort of restrictive policies and others favor much more compassionate policies.”
Downtown Women’s Center CEO Amy Turk began the event by emphasizing the crisis of homelessness affecting 18,000 women across Los Angeles County along with seniors, LGBTQ people and people of color. She urged those in attendance who hold powerful positions to brainstorm solutions to address affordable housing. 
“Women have told us what they need in terms of housing, community resources and healthcare,” Turk said. “It’s now on us, who hold privileged positions within government, academia and advocacy to align funding, legislation and further research to those needs.”
After Turk’s opening, Urban Voices Project — a community that helps those who have experienced homelessness cope through music — danced down the aisle, energizing the crowd by singing “Walk with Me.” The group shared musical numbers with the audience that many of the members related to, including Marilyn Irizarry, who experienced homelessness for decades in part due to health issues including breast cancer. 
Price School of Public Policy Dean Jack Knott compared the dramatic disparities of living costs and low income wages in L.A. with other states, including Texas, Ohio and Arkansas.
“The combination of [low income and high housing costs] means that we are the most expensive and unaffordable city in the country,” Knott said. 
Former California Gov. Gray Davis said homelessness in L.A. is in a state of emergency and that the issue should have the same priority as L.A. sports stadiums have had in the past. Levi’s Stadium, home to the San Francisco 49ers, was able to override environmental reviews in 2010. 
“You can’t tell me that it’s more important to build a stadium than it is to house and treat the least among us — the homeless,” Davis said. 
Schwarzenegger called California “the most beautiful place in the country” and a “golden dream,” acknowledging how California encourages people to visit the state. However, he said the state has left the homeless community behind. 
“There are over 150,000 people in our state that are considered homeless,” he said. “For them, the golden dream is out of reach and that is unacceptable … Almost 40% of the people are afraid that they or someone in their family will become homeless. These numbers are staggering. [Homelessness] is a crisis. We can do better, and we must do better.” 
Carson highlighted programs that HUD has implemented to address housing insecurity in the United States, including awarding more than $2 billion to support local homelessness assistance programs such as local churches. Carson also said liberals and conservatives need to work together to solve the crisis. 
Katie Ross, a junior majoring in public policy, said she enjoyed the bipartisan nature of the event. 
“There were a lot of people from Democratic sides as well as Republican ideologies,” Ross said. “I thought it was a really interesting way of bringing everyone together on social issues, especially homelessness that’s affecting a lot of California.”
Garcetti also looked back on the state’s past of abundant jobs and affordable housing and called the state of homelessness in California a “double heartbreak.” He hopes the situation will improve in the near future. 
“I hope to have that conversation one day of saying, ‘Now nobody has the right to be on a sidewalk,’” Garcetti said. “[To say that] today, you will get a [housing] voucher regardless of your immigration status, regardless of your age, regardless of whether you’ve served time.”

For Alexis McDonald, fashion is a way to empower women. From age 5 she remembers visiting thrift stores with her grandmother — something that quickly piqued her interest in the industry. By age 8 she was already creating clothing designs in her composition book. Through her upcoming women’s boutique, McDonald said she wants to empower and pay homage to Black women by showcasing their historical and iconic styles. 
Launching in April, Street Madonnas will serve as an online platform for both shopping and creating camaraderie among women consumers through conversations about fashion and style. The platform will feature a community page where users can share their thoughts through posts and forum discussions centered on offering style tips and opinions on fashion events.
Street Madonnas is a project that McDonald is working on outside of her studies in the Roski School of Art and Design. She said she wants to highlight trends Black women have pioneered throughout history, such as bamboo earrings and long acrylic nails, on Street Madonnas to make sure Black women receive credit where it is due. 
“I wanted to create a website and a store that is content-driven versus sales-driven because I believe that once you have people hooked in onto your brand, then converting them to customers is really easy,” McDonald said. 
Nigel Richardson, a former University of Miami classmate who met McDonald while they were both working as resident assistants at the school, said he has watched her creativity develop as she continues to break fashion norms. 
“I’ve really seen her personal style evolve,” Richardson said. “She’s always trying to push the limits on things … explore different  fashion trends but also trying to push the envelope — [trying not] to follow a trend that already exists but trying to start something herself.”
The concept for Street Madonnas is based on McDonald’s creative vision of integrating culture and fashion. Her business aims to create an online community through implementing elements of social media into her online boutique that allows users to interact with one another. She hopes to cultivate an online space for Black women to celebrate and archive their unique style. 
“I want to make sure that Black women are given the credit that we are due,” McDonald said. “I want Street Madonnas to be a place where we can commune and talk about fashion. We can buy fashion. We can explore … what it means to us as a community but [also] allies [of Black women] as well.” 
Using her University of Miami degree in electronic media, which is a hybrid of film and journalism, she is working on a USC master’s thesis in studio arts focusing on the exploration of her relationship with hip-hop as a Black woman. McDonald said she faced challenges developing her art at USC because of the lack of diversity in the student body and faculty, which she said makes it difficult for them to understand her experience as a Black woman.
“I have yet to meet an African American woman professor … in the arts program,” McDonald said. “I’ve had a lot of support for my ideas, but … I would like to be pushed and challenged a little bit more. I think [professors] really support my ideas — they just don’t really have the same perspective or the context that I have [as a Black woman].” 
Jennifer West, associate professor at the Roski school and chair of Art in 4D, met McDonald during a studio visit in October 2019. Since then, West said she has seen McDonald’s progression as an artist through her current work on her master’s thesis hip-hop feminism, which examines the relationship between feminism and hip-hop culture. McDonald draws on inspiration from “video vixens” — female dancers in early-2000s music videos — and analyzed and recontextualized the images of these women. 
West now sits on McDonald’s thesis committee, and they talk on a weekly basis to continue to develop McDonald’s thesis exhibition, which will open Feb. 27. Like Street Madonnas, McDonald’s thesis continues on with her exploration of the culture of Black women. 
“She got access to this archive of this African American-based magazine that features women on the cover, which is part of her show,” West said. “She reached out and she actually got a substantial portion of this actual archive … she’s created this whole show around that.” 
West said McDonald was passionate about exploring the African American experience through her art, be that through her work at USC or her work on Street Madonnas. Her work throughout her time at USC has largely focused on the empowerment of Black women, confronting the historical misogyny within the hip-hop community. 
“I see her becoming part of a dialogue that’s going on around women and identity and race in artists working across the country,” West said. “She’s young, and I hope she continues to develop this practice and just start exhibiting.”
McDonald said she plans to use the clothing boutique as a way to honor fashion in the Black community. She cited hip-hop artists like Lil’ Kim and Salt-N-Pepa as style icons who broke barriers with their style as Black women.
“I want Street Madonnas to … pay homage to our culture,” McDonald said. “Making sure that it’s a place that archives, that honors that history of the way that Black women enjoy getting dressed and use dress as a form of expression and a form of agency and representation.”
Richardson said he understands McDonald’s creative vision, both as an artist and businesswoman, and noted her ambition and work ethic.
“I know that there are only more great things to come because when she puts her mind to something, she really makes sure that she follows through and that is successful,” Richardson said. “I think this Street Madonnas is the beginning of her just growing more into a digital media mogul.”

Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has found another way to ruffle the purists’ feathers.  
Earlier this week, Joel Sherman of the New York Post reported on the league’s supposed plan to shake up the current postseason format, and the changes are both sweeping and borderline radical. As the plan goes, the playoff field would be expanded from five to seven teams per league. The club with the best record in each league would get a bye past the first round of the playoffs, straight to the Division Series. 
That first round is where the chaos would ensue. The next-best team would choose between the three Wild Card teams to take on in the first round. The league’s third-best team would get the next choice, and the last two teams remaining would face off to round out the Wild Card Round. That round would feature three best-of-three series hosted exclusively by the team with the better record. 
Fans hate it. I had the same reaction at first glance. But despite all the questionable moves Manfred has made as commish, with this one, it seems that he might be onto something.
MLB has struggled mightily with growing the game of baseball among younger generations, in part due to its slower pace of play and in part due to its bizarre unwillingness to market its players. But this move represents a deliberate attempt by Manfred and the league to sell the sport on what American society craves: drama.
I’m not talking the bottom of the ninth inning, bases loaded, full count, two outs type of drama. I’m talking the kind of drama that will inevitably ensue when teams are presented with the option to choose their opponents on the game’s biggest stage.
Much more will be at play than pitching matchups and lineups. Yes, those will guide the actual selections, but the talk from the fans and pundits will circle around the side plots. Which teams had the biggest beanball war in the middle of May? Which team’s second-best starting pitchers talk the most trash to each other on social media? Will the Yankees pick the Red Sox just to beat their rival, or will they avoid the potential humiliation of losing to their hated enemy? Are they soft for choosing the latter? Bloodthirsty for choosing the former? The teams, players and coaches won’t give a shit about any of that. But it’ll get everyone else talking.
And Manfred knows this. That’s part of why his initial vision involves this playoff draft taking place on a live broadcasted Sunday evening spectacle — it’s reality TV. 
People will eat it up. Think about it — we spend our downtime keeping up with the Kardashians and poring over who in “The Bachelor” will get the final rose (trust me, I know — I did the latter yesterday). Anywhere we smell drama, even if it’s petty and stupid, we’re sucked in.
Manfred knows this is the model. He knows it’s the model because his league has been embarrassingly surpassed by the NBA and its readiness to create, endorse and spotlight that same type of petty drama between players, coaches, executives and anyone remotely involved in the NBA sphere.
Every time Damian Lillard looks in the general vicinity of Russell Westbrook, it sets the NBA world ablaze. Jimmy Butler made people actually give half a shit about T.J. Warren. Fans ogled over the momentary feud between young rookie Ja Morant and seasoned veteran, three-time champ Steph Curry.
And what, exactly, has that done for the NBA? The league’s popularity has exploded in recent years and, in turn, basketball has been brought to the forefront of almost every sports broadcast or talk show on television. Is it annoying to the real fans? Of course. But what does Adam Silver care? In his world, money really does grow on trees. 
There’s a slight catch, though. These beefs? They’re not real. They’re fabricated. The players open the door a crack by calling the other guy a stupidface, and the NBA sphere busts it open with a battering ram and paints the picture that they’re after each other’s families. Then the players publicly talk about how it’s not that deep and everyone needs to chill the fuck out, but the armchair analysts willfully ignore that part because that’s not as entertaining.
That’s what Manfred is going for. He knows the audience he’s trying to cater to — one that will eat up pettiness like dessert and create storylines out of the slightest perception of animosity. It is, after all, what much of American culture thrives on — whether it’s entertainment, politics, sports, you name it. 
Maybe Manfred is misguided. Maybe what works for the NBA and reality TV doesn’t work for MLB. But Manfred’s at a point where he has to find a way — some way — to increase the league’s appeal. 
While I’m a fan of the proposed format (I’m aware I’m in the extreme minority) for other reasons, I don’t think the increased drama is the right way to grow the game. 
Be that as it may, Manfred isn’t totally insane to think it might be.

The USC baseball team kicks off the 2020 season this weekend with a three-game home series against Western Michigan at Dedeaux Field.
Following a disappointing season in 2019, USC decided not to renew head coach Dan Hubbs’ contract after the season. In June, former athletic director Lynne Swann announced it had hired former longtime LMU head coach Jason Gill as its new head coach. In the time since, Gill has made it a point to change the culture around USC baseball, foregoing a sole emphasis on results in favor of first establishing a focus on relationships and development. 
So far, players are liking what they’ve seen from their new skipper and are confident about the season. 
“There’s really no limit to this team,” junior outfielder Bart West said. “There’s so much talent. We’re under such a great coaching staff and we know how hard we’ve been working every day, so we’re really excited.”
Gill will look to guide the Trojans above .500 on the season for the first time since 2015.
USC hopes to build on last season’s 25-29-1 campaign. Without significant contributors like outfielder Matthew Acosta, catcher CJ Stubbs and outfielder Blake Sabol — all of whom departed following last season after being selected in the MLB Draft — the Trojans have a few holes to fill. 
Between those three and infielders Chase Bushor and Brandon Perez, USC lost a combined  21 of the team’s 32 home runs from last season. 
Acosta was the only Trojan to finish the season with a batting average over .300 last season, posting a team-high mark of .319.  He also owned the team’s highest OPS at .899. 
Hoping to fill this void at the plate is senior outfielder Brady Shockey, who Gill labeled as USC’s most complete hitter after fall workouts. 
Shockey had the second highest batting average of the 2019 team, posting a mark of .295 in 14 at bats.
Along with Shockey, Gill and the Trojans are hoping for major contributions from expected starting third baseman junior Jamal O’Guinn, who had a strong average of .281 last season. O’Guinn demonstrated impressive plate discipline, drawing 27 walks — the top mark of any returning player for USC. He also had the most home runs of all returners with five. 
On the mound, USC will be expecting increased contributions from starting juniors righty Kyle Hurt and lefty Isaac Esqueda, both of whom started more than 10 games for the Trojans last season. 
Hurt is one of USC’s strikeout artists, leading the pitching staff in punchouts last season with 81 in just 74.1 innings. Still, Hurt will be looking to bounce back from a disappointing 5.69 ERA and reestablish himself as an early round pick in the MLB Draft.   
In relief, the Trojans will have the luxury of bringing in the likes of sophomore righty Carson Lambert — who tied with Clarke for the team lead with 27 appearances — and junior lefty John Beller out of the pen. 
The bullpen will hope to minimize the impact of losing closer Chris Clarke to the Major Leagues. Clarke led all USC relievers last season with 52.1 innings pitched and a stellar ERA of 1.03. 
Beller will hope to build off a promising 2019 season. He tossed 49 innings with an ERA of 3.86 for the Trojans last year, switching between roles as a reliever and a starter throughout the season. 
Despite the encouraging returners on USC’s roster, many media outlets are skeptical of the Trojans’ chances to succeed in Gill’s first season at the helm. A recent Pac-12 coaches poll predicted USC to finish seventh in the conference.
Gill, on the other hand, sees things differently. 
“A couple different publications —the two major ones I think — have us picked to finish in eighth in the Pac-12, and I think the coaches poll has us picked to finish seventh in the Pac-12,” Gill said. “The good news is that those don’t really matter, they’re preseason picks. I don’t think really anybody knows what’s in our camp.”
Gill and USC will be looking to take advantage of a local preseason by getting into a rhythm before conference play opens up with a home series against Washington on March 13. 
USC won’t leave Southern California until 15 games into the season, when it will visit the Oregon Ducks  March 20.
Before looking ahead, however, the Trojans will need to stay focused on the task at hand in Western Michigan, which went 18-31 last year and will also open its season this weekend. 
For the second straight year, Hurt is slated to start opening day on the hill. Last season, he tossed five innings on opening night against Nebraska, giving up 3 runs (2 earned) while racking up six strikeouts in a Trojan win.
The rest of the opening weekend rotation will be filled by Esqueda and redshirt sophomore lefty Alex Cornwell. 
“I’m excited to finally play someone in a different uniform,” senior utility John Thomas said. “It’s been a lot of intrasquads against each other. But getting to play somebody else will be pretty cool. 
Hurt and the Trojans will open up their season and Gill’s tenure as head coach Friday at 6 p.m.

USC returned to Galen Center Thursday and left with a 62-56 win against Pac-12 foe Washington. The victory broke the Trojans’ three game losing streak and improved their conference record to 7-5.
The game represented a stark contrast to USC’s 72-40 blowout loss to Washington in January: USC limited the Huskies to a 35% shooting percentage Thursday. 
“Great win for our team,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said after the game. “It was a good battle defensively … We had eight guys show up tonight and really compete.”
The first 20 minutes of the game acted as an adjustment period for a USC offense missing star freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu, who was sidelined with a concussion. The Trojans went 9-33 from the field during the half and allowed the Huskies to gain a 5-point lead on the heels of a standout performance from freshman forward Jaden McDaniels.
By the end of the half, McDaniels had already bested his 12-point- per-game average with 14. The guard finished with a season-best 19 points. 
The Huskies ran a tough zone defense, but it didn’t make the paint impenetrable. Once the Trojans got in the lane, it was just a matter of finishing their shots. Unfortunately for USC, their forwards proved unable to do so for much of the half. Senior forward Nick Rakocevic entered the break with only 6 points alongside freshman forward Isaiah Mobley’s 5.
But the Trojans’ offensive energy dramatically improved in the second half. USC scored 9 unanswered points to start the half and reclaimed a 34-30 lead within just three minutes.
USC’s shooting prowess eventually began to wear Washington down. After freshman guard Ethan Anderson went out with a hyperextended knee four minutes into the second half, senior guard Jonah Mathews got hot, sinking three 3-pointers and finishing the game with 16 points.
But Rakocevic was the star of the second half turnaround. He poured in 14 points in the final 20 minutes, giving him a team-best 19 on the night to go along with nine rebounds in Okongwu’s absence. 
The scoring explosion was coupled with a defensive surge that allowed USC to win the turnover battle, forcing Washington to cough the ball up 11 times. McDaniels didn’t see nearly as many easy buckets in the second half while teammate freshman forward Isaiah Stewart was limited to just 4 points in the paint.
Stewart was guarded by Rakocevic, freshman forward Max Agbonkpolo and Mobley. Agbonkpolo, whose minutes have been limited by Okongwu’s dominant presence on the court, finished with a season-best six rebounds that contributed to a team total of 45. 
At halftime, USC alum and current San Antonio Spur DeMar DeRozan was honored by having his No. 10 jersey retired. The four-time NBA All-Star and Olympic gold medalist led the Trojans in the 2008-09 season to a Pac-10 title. DeRozan attended the game alongside his family and former teammates.
“These are the moments we should all be able to enjoy and express and feel the love and be with the ones you love and care about,” DeRozan told the audience before the banner reveal. “I appreciate everyone here, I appreciate USC for honoring me with this.”
To keep their momentum going against Washington State this weekend, the Trojans will have to continue protecting the ball and rely on their defensive ability to shut opponents down.
USC finds itself tied at fifth place in the Pac-12 with a March Madness berth still up in the air.
“It’s getting real, but you just have to stay focused,” Mathews said. “It’s all going to come together. We got to keep on winning.”
The Trojans will take on Washington State at Galen Center Saturday. Tipoff is at 5 p.m.

Students arrive at USC with wide-eyed anticipation. Gorgeous campus tours and dozens of welcome letters draw students in with the promise that they are joining a family at a university that puts them first. It’s a naive expectation, built on alumni networks, free Lyfts and football games. 
All the shiny stuff is just a Trojan horse. Private school education is a billion-dollar industry and USC — like all other private institutions — is first and foremost a business. The needs of its students come second to the bottom line. 
In the face of scandal, USC’s Board of Trustees has proven its first move is to cover itself and secure its assets. Following the Varsity Blues scandal that broke last spring, the very first correspondence the University made with its students was an email dismissing responsibility and labeling itself as the victim in fraudulent acts perpetrated against the University. The Board did not care to address obvious negligence in admissions standards or apologize to the students who did earn their place. 
Acknowledging fault is bad for business. The Board’s priority is to maintain the status of an elite institution to attract donors. Their priority is with image, modus operandi for how private schools do business. The Board has never been very concerned with transparency; the names of its executive committee weren’t made public until last spring. It wasn’t until USC was under national scrutiny and its reputation was on the line for the Board to decide to change how it operates. After finding themselves the subject of countless think pieces, trending on Twitter and being clowned on Saturday Night Live, they finally landed on the ingenious conclusion that something wasn’t right.
The “big and meaningful” changes Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso spoke of in pursuit of more transparent dealings were little more than a PR move, likely just a tarp to cover the issue until it was out of sight, out of mind. The Board’s executive committee has more billionaires than it does people of color and is overwhelmingly male; there is no reason that should be the case. 
It’s silly to expect a board that doesn’t effectively represent such a diverse student body to make decisions with its best interests in mind. The Board’s resistance to adding a student or faculty representative speaks to a lack of interest in hearing student voices, especially marginalized voices. 
The Varsity Blues scandal showed that, to USC, what was important wasn’t achievement but who could afford to put names on new buildings. It wasn’t about the depth of experience but the depth of one’s pockets. This ethos perpetuated by the Board seeps into student attitudes. Varsity Blues was a message to students that they weren’t as important to their school as the people who could afford to bankroll it. 
In setting its agenda as a cash machine — and in the makeup of its voting body — the Board established who matters most: rich people, especially those “fortunate” enough to be white and male. This only exacerbated pre-existing feelings of class division at a school where students wear Off-White and a fistful of Cartier to a 9 a.m. discussion. 
The University perpetuates elitism because the elite are the ones signing checks and financing USC Village expansions. With a nearly all-white, all-wealthy Board, the University is subliminally telling its students that minority voices are of lesser importance. 
Every time they find themselves implicated in a scandal, the Board purports that they had no knowledge of said wrongdoing. This excuse is as hard to believe as it is meaningless because, at the very least, the Board is one that allows corruption. Whether or not they were aware of said corruption is of little consequence because regardless they are complicit in it. They are so resistant to major changesbecause corruption is essential to any thriving business, and why would they want to stop the money machine? 
The admissions scandal was a textbook demonstration of USC’s premium on donors and the wealthier students who can bring them in. USC will always be a business. That won’t change. However, upon committing to the school, USC students were made a promise that they were attending an institution that prioritizes their needs. 
Trojans must continue to press the Board to change how it operates — in ways that will be bad for business. By taking away their money, students incentivize the University to actually do something. In order to make waves with the Board; students have to find a way to block the buck. Then, they will have to listen. 
Marching down Trousdale and making a noise that cannot be ignored isn’t hopeless. Students don’t need to feel complicit when their money is the Board’s prime objective. While students may never truly be made a priority over business, members of the community can at least take steps to force their Board to pretend more convincingly.

Two weeks ago, Peter Weber’s season of “The Bachelor” was a complete mess. Now, with just four women remaining, viewers finally have some clarity as we head into hometown dates. Last week, Peter sent home four contestants, Sydney, Tammy, Victoria P. and Mykenna, after their involvement in a highly tense drama which included lots of lying, accusing and denial.
Season 24 of “The Bachelor” has delivered drama in ways that no other season has, but that is by no means a good thing. In my opinion, this season’s toxicity has reached levels that have detracted from the audience’s enjoyment. While the show is meant for audiences to embrace the fantasy romance, this season is exposing the dark side of “The Bachelor” as a reality show pitting women against each other in a harmful way. I would even argue that this negative portrayal of women is degrading and anti-feminist. 
Most recently, Mykenna and Tammy decided to hash it out as Peter began to make some major decisions about who to keep, and they realized their chances of advancing were slim. Their beef began after Tammy accused Mykenna of being overly dramatic and moody and the two engaged in a vicious shouting match that Peter overheard in the next room. 
However, the tension only grew as the two took turns venting their frustrations to Peter, accusing each other of childish behavior and dishonesty. Eventually, Peter sent both women home, which solved the problem but does not detract from the excessive pettiness that both of them showed. 
The women are in no situation to encourage or empower each other. Rather, they are thrown into an uncomfortable, messy spot where their only option is to compete.
Therefore, Mykenna and Tammy’s poisonous behavior should not be surprising by any means because having the women clash and claw is inherently a major part of the show. 
The women all live together, have too much free time, are constantly seen drinking and, most importantly, are all fighting for the same man. It would obviously be difficult to be a woman on the show and have to deal with about 20 other women all dating the same person. In addition, the contestants are forced to commit 100% of their time and effort to the show. They have to leave their jobs, their families and all contact with the outside world just to get their hearts broken on national TV. 
I would imagine that the women feel helpless and that the situation is to some extent out of their control. Because of this, the show breeds a “me-first” mentality that results in toxicity among the women. Every girl wants that next one-on-one date or time alone with Peter, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to get there, with no regard for who they hurt along the way — including themselves. 
Victoria P. was one contestant who hurt both herself and others while on the show. Her situation is a perfect example of how women are degraded and exploited in the name of entertainment.
At first, she earned an early one-on-one date after catching Peter’s attention and becoming a solid frontrunner. However, her demise began after she denied being good friends with contestant Alayah even though there was proof that they had a relationship before the show. 
Victoria P. had few reasons to lie, except for maybe one — to get Alayah eliminated. Victoria P. most likely knew that Alayah was under fire and she was probably smart enough to realize that she had enough sway over Peter to influence his actions and choices. She also may have wanted to separate herself from the drama by distancing herself from Alayah. 
Either way, her actions and words were pointed toward one end goal — to get closer with Peter and have a better chance of winning with one less contestant to compete with. However, her actions backfired, and she ended up ruining her relationship with both Peter and Alayah. Peter ended up having doubts about her integrity and character as a whole, and Alayah probably did not want to be friends with her anymore.
Victoria’s words may ultimately have caused Peter to send Alayah home, but it was also the reason that she got sent home. 
I was honestly surprised that Victoria P. lied in the first place since she did not seem like she would be a villain at first, but that goes to show that “The Bachelor” can bring out the worst in people at inopportune times. 
The fact is that this show takes advantage of women and their emotions because it provides entertainment for America. Audiences want to see the fights and competition, even at the expense of the contestants’ dignity.

Inhale, exhale. 
Students who seek to find balance with their academics, job applications, work, sleep, exercise and social events can find a different kind of inner peace at the USC Fisher Museum of Art. With artwork that spans from the 16th century to the present, students can stretch their muscles and calm their minds surrounded by the museum’s collection. 
In partnership with USC Recreational Sports, the Fisher Museum hosts one-hour yoga sessions every Thursday at 10 a.m. All students, staff and faculty are welcome to practice yoga within the 80-year-old walls of the building. 
Brigid Harmon, the museum’s communications and marketing coordinator, hopes that the free event will incentivize students to not only practice yoga but also appreciate the intriguing artwork.
“We want people to go to the museum and see the art,” Harmon said. “We really want to create events for students to feel like the museum is theirs … It’s the University’s museum, and we want to get people who are on campus into the space.” 
Divya Choudhary, a graduate student studying computer science and an international Ashtanga Yoga-certified instructor, has done just that. Choudhary’s Ashtanga Yoga certification means she has not only mastered the poses of yoga, but she has also learned how to connect her mind and body together within the practice. Ashtanga translates to “eight-limbed yoga” in Sanskrit, and the certification process is rigorous as students must follow postures in specific sequences. But the hard work paid off, as Choudhary said she has learned to connect her body and mind together. 
“I started doing yoga in my childhood, unaware that it was yoga. I used to do Ashtanga poses not knowing that they are Ashtanga,” Choudhary said. “As I grew up I became more and more involved. There was a lot of stress that was coming up because of the responsibilities I was taking … [which] took me to the meditation side of yoga, and I tried it and really loved it.”
Choudhary has been teaching the class at the Fisher Museum since Spring 2019 and recommends students try it as a way to relax in the morning before their classes. Additionally, the spaciousness of the museum provides participants with a special yoga experience, she said. 
“The museum is huge so it gives a lot of room for the participants and also being surrounded by the artwork while you’re doing yoga is very grounding in a way,” Choudhary said. “[It] gives you a better feeling of being present.” 
The combination of artwork within the museum and calming yoga postures provides students with an alternative workout experience. 
Stanley Davis, a graduate student studying astronautical engineering, is a regular Fisher yoga class attendee. As a former track athlete, Davis said he appreciates Choudhary’s willingness to engage with all people interested in the discipline, regardless of their experience level, and loves to stretch his muscles before starting his day. The class is less of a formal workout and more of an immersive art, body and mind experience, he said. 
“I like the atmosphere because it’s different when you’re at a museum,” Davis said. “It feels like less of a workout…  It’s good for your body and I’ve been realizing more and more it’s good for your mental health, so I would always recommend [the class].”
In a similar vein, Harmon encourages all members of the USC community to take a class to relax, exercise and appreciate the artwork. Taking the time for introspection in a quiet and comfortable environment is essential for busy college students.
“We have this space and we have this beautiful art, and we’re really looking to provide people who come to yoga with a sedating experience that involves people doing yoga … in a situation that’s calming, that’s quiet,” Harmon said. “Even if you’re not paying attention to what the art looks like, it’s a space that probably feels good to be around. So that’s why we are trying to have these meditative wellness moments for the people on campus.” 
Due to the openness, free structure and minimal commitment required to attend the classes, Harmon said  yoga at Fisher can accommodate many different schedules, . Because of this, the event attracts many different people — faculty and students alike. 
“It’s a nice environment, a nice place to exercise and recharge,” Davis said. “The instructor is very inclusive and she will help you advance at whatever level you’re at. You’re getting the workout from the gym without going to the gym.” 
Although the artistic atmosphere shifts based on every new exhibition in the museum, the event’s concept remains the same — to cultivate a calming relationship between yoga, art, exercise and mindfulness. USC community members can attend with varying levels of proficiency in yoga and solely concentrate on their physical and mental health while enjoying the artistic atmosphere within the museum, according to Harmon.

The USC women’s basketball team returns to Galen Center to face off against No. 11 Oregon State Friday and No. 3 Oregon Sunday. Friday’s game is USC’s first home game of the month after going 2-2 during its last four road games.
Oregon State and Oregon make for some of the toughest Pac-12 competition USC has faced this season. The Trojans lost to No. 22 Arizona State, No. 12 Arizona and No. 8 Stanford in the past two weeks, dropping their conference record to 4-8. 
During last weekend’s 79-59 loss against Stanford, USC fell to a 28-point deficit by halftime after going only 21% from the field. Given the sharp shooters coming to Galen Center this weekend, the Trojans are going to need to improve if they hope to keep up. OSU’s freshman forward Taylor Jones and Oregon’s senior forward Ruthy Hebard rank No. 13 and No. 3 in the country in field goal percentage. 
“We [need] to work on urgency to the shooter,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “Containing the ball, we [need] to contain the post and we [need to] guard all their sets.”
Aside from the offensive threat posed by Jones, senior guard Mikayla Pivec presents a serious challenge in the paint with an average of 9.7 rebounds per game. Pivec will be matched up with a USC lineup led by senior forward Kayla Overbeck and freshman forward Alissa Pili. However, last weekend’s Bay Area tour also proved that freshman forward Angel Jackson has plenty of potential.
Jackson went 9-11 from the field with 19 points and nine rebounds in USC’s 75-67 win over Cal. In Sunday’s game against Stanford, Jackson added to her stat sheet with seven rebounds and 9 points. The trio of her, Pili and Overbeck can put up the defensive effort necessary to frustrate OSU.
“The chemistry is good, the kids are really good, our culture is good,” Trakh said. “They’re excited [and] they want to play so think our program right now is in a really good position moving forward.”
The Ducks are currently 7-1 on the road and have repeatedly held opponents off with over 30-point wins — don’t expect them to be intimidated by a hostile environment at Galen. 
Oregon’s offensive production is currently operating at an impressive .503 efficiency rate with the help of Herbard and arguably the best player in women’s college basketball, likely No. 1 WNBA Draft pick senior guard Sabrina Ionescu. 
Oregon has put up a staggering 85.9 points per game this season — the most in Division I. 
During this week’s practices, Trakh’s team ran through all of Oregon’s offensive sets to set the pacing for the defense. According to Jackson, awareness of each teammate’s responsibility on the opponent’s side of the court is key to stopping shots.
“We just practice our sets, make sure we get out on shooters, make sure we are defending off the line,” Jackson said. “I guess it’s trusting each other — that’s big for [our] defense.”
The Trojans have only six games left before the Pac-12 tournament begins. Oregon State and Oregon are two of the toughest teams in the country and could provide a gauge of how USC can expect to fare come tournament time.  
USC tips off against Oregon State Friday at 7 p.m. and against Oregon Sunday at 1 p.m.
