A professor of public ethics and citizenship at USC’s School of Policy, Planning, and Development has been elected as a fellow to the National Academy of Public Administration, a national organization that assists in Congressional research.
Professor Terry Cooper will be formally inducted into the academy on Nov. 18 in Washington, D.C.

The NAPA is a non-partisan, non-profit organization that was established by a Congressional charter in 1967. The organization’s research and projects are mandated and funded primarily by Congress. It is not a government agency but rather an independent body with discretion.
“It allows Congress to have connections to people that can help with projects,” Cooper said.
With expertise from its 680 fellows, the academy provides key insight into issues of public administration and the workings of public organizations, in addition to serving an advisory role to government agencies.
The academy’s members are chosen from thousands of practitioners in fields of and related to public administration and political science.
As a fellow, Cooper will sit alongside other prominent figures, such as former and current presidential cabinet members, governors, city managers and deans of colleges and universities.
Cooper’s notoriety in the fields of ethics and civic engagement, which he considers his primary interests, earned him the credibility that contributed to his election as a fellow, said Jack Knott, dean of SPPD.
“He has written what I think is the most prominent book for public administrators. … His work is of value in both the public and private sectors,” Knott said. “It is an extremely important topic as we’ve recently learned with the Bell scandal.”
The scandal involved eight city officials from Bell, Calif., who were arrested for using public funds to inflate their own salaries.
Cooper is currently working on the sixth edition of his book, The Responsible Administrator, which is used in countless ethics courses around the world and SPPD’s own Citizenship and Public Ethics (PPD 240).
“It [became] required reading for all master of public administration programs in China in 2000.  … There are now over 100 [programs there], and this book is one in a set of core readings,” Cooper said.
Cooper is also particularly well known for his work with citizen participation and the democratic process, Knott said.
“He has a reputation both nationally and internationally, having done work here in Los Angeles looking at the roles of communities and neighborhoods and also some work in China with housing and other local issues,” Knott said.
Cooper’s performance as a professor is equally impressive, said Claire Feeney, a senior majoring in urban planning who has taken two classes with Cooper.
“He basically invented [PPD 240], because he literally wrote the whole book,” she said. “He likes class discussion that’s more driven by the students. … He really [values] student input and involvement.”
Cooper said he is primarily focusing on continuing the kinds of issues around which he has already built his reputation. In his capacity as a fellow, he will be looking closely at how the federal government handles ethics.
“The U.S. Office of Government Ethics, from my point of view, is not about ethics. It’s all about laws, and I would like to see them doing more with regard to cultivating [ethical behavior among] professionals,” he said.
Cooper said he is looking forward to having the opportunity to learn from a variety of academy colleagues in a manner that he believes reflects the interdisciplinary spirit of SPPD.
“One of the advantages of being in the academy is you get pulled into projects you might not otherwise do,” he said.
After his induction in November, Cooper will participate in a discussion about future academy projects in which he might be interested in participating.
Cooper has worked with NAPA before, participating in a research panel funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.
Knott said he believes Cooper’s successes in academia will provide notable contributions to the national academy.
“Given the scale of news media and the size of political jurisdictions, it’s easy for neighborhoods and citizens to feel disconnected from the political process. [Cooper] has been a real leader in addressing this very issue,” Knott said.

USC interim Provost Elizabeth Garrett recently appointed the new Strategic Planning Committee that will establish a plan to guide the university’s future development.
Strategic plans help advance USC by creating goals based on the values of the university and determine the steps that need to be taken in achieving those goals.
“What they try to do is look at USC’s mission and institutional context … then judge from this moment where the university is heading, where it ought to head and try to come up with a strategy for getting there,” said Robin Romans, the associate provost and ex officio member — or coordinator — of the committee
Previous strategic plans focused on providing a unique undergraduate education and strengthening interdisciplinary education and research. Many goals remain consistent throughout the years but strategies are redefined to address the changing circumstances.
Though the committee has been established, it has yet to set any definite goals for this year, he said.
The 2010-2011 Strategic Planning Committee, which includes 22 faculty members, has met once to begin developing ideas for the new plan, which should be completed in approximately 18 months, Romans said.
Garrett, chair of the committee, said she hopes to provide many opportunities for individuals to participate in creating the strategic plan, as it will greatly influence the direction of the school.
“This is very much a process that will involve all segments of USC’s academic community: faculty, staff and students,” Garrett said.
Depending on the provisions the strategic plan makes, funding might be necessary to achieve its goals. The committee will find ways to meet financial requirements by potentially pulling from other funds, Romans said.
“We wouldn’t have a strategic planning process if we weren’t serious about implementing it,” Romans said. “The funding of it is kind of secondary in the sense that we will find funding.”
Romans said there will be several opportunities for people to have input through participation in subcommittees and through a new strategic planning website.
The website, which will be available in two weeks, allows individuals to read updates on the committee’s proceedings as well as submit their own feedback, Garrett said.
“This is a university that has a long history of working together as an academic community to chart our strategic course, and the strategic plan has served as guideposts in our course as an academic institution,” Garrett said.
This involvement helps maintain the vitality of the university, Garrett said, as the strategic plan is a central aspect of USC culture.
Pablo Ortiz de Urbina, a senior majoring in music performance (French horn), has been at the university for five years and has noticed the impact of the strategic plan.
“[The strategic plans] try to include the students in the involvement  … Try to expand the academic field. It does have an impact,” he said.
Ortiz said he hopes the next strategic plan continues building a closer relationship between students and professors and focuses on enriching the reputation of the school.
“I would like to change the reputation of this school into more academic and pure academic, less athletic,” he said. “In five years, USC has gone a lot more academic I feel and a lot more serious and also a lot more open with their relationship between students and teachers.”

Four panelists spoke Wednesday at the Gay & Greek Panel Discussion about their experiences in the Greek community and how they felt to be “out” and on The Row.
All sides · Senior Mary Walsh speaks at the Gay & Greek Panel hosted by QuASA on Wednesday, moderated by sophomore Nick Powers. - Chloe Stepney | Daily Trojan 
The panel, part of the Queer and Ally Student Association’s celebration of Coming Out month, is part of an effort to bring different facets of the USC community together, said Emily Allen, executive director of QuASA.
“Stereotypically, the Greek community is one that has been known to be different from the gay community,” Allen said. “We want to see where those differences are coming from and encourage communication between the different communities.”
David Salter, a USC alumnus of the class of 2006 and panelist, said he never explicitly talked about his sexuality during rush.
“I was told they were aware of it, but they let me in anyway. I always had this idea that there was a line I had to toe,” Salter said. “It was great that I was in, but I couldn’t push my luck.”
Salter said he felt he had to maintain a specific image to fit in within his fraternity.
“I would make the jokes before they could so they didn’t make the jokes and I felt bad,” Salter said. “To them it was kind of like, ‘OK, you’re not too gay for us.’ For me, it was like I was trying very hard but I want to be myself.”
Salter said most students are not usually conscious of how often they use the terms.
“There are a lot of genuinely good people out there who do and say things that could be genuinely damaging, and I don’t really know what to do with that,” Salter said. “There are a lot of people who say things like, ‘That’s gay’ and don’t think it will hurt or offend anyone.”
For panelist Mary Walsh, a senior majoring in gender studies and creative writing, being bisexual in a sorority has made the Greek community an interesting experience.
“The whole frat culture kind of turns me off about living on The Row. It’s very misogynistic,” Walsh said. “That kind of culture makes it hard to not only be out on The Row, but there’s this whole culture of, ‘Get the girls, get those girls.’”
Though Walsh said she loves her sorority, she does not find girls to be more accepting.
“As much as people like to think of girls as being more open-minded about homosexuality, how many lesbians do you see walking around campus in letters?” Walsh asked. “I have heard of a few women who are closeted in sororities, but I’ve never met them. They’re like Santa Claus to me.”
Max Rubin, a sophomore majoring in animation and digital arts, said his experience in a fraternity has been a very positive one.
“They’re so good about it that they’re afraid to offend me,” Rubin said. “It’s always really silly questions that are mostly sexual. The challenge is getting them to be comfortable and have them say what they want around me.”
Andrè Moss, a sophomore majoring in theatre and English, said he came to the panel because he thought it would be interesting, despite not wanting to join a fraternity.
“If I had an interest in rushing, I wouldn’t let being gay stop me. I don’t have a lot of guy friends, so if I did rush, that would be the main reason I would do it,” Moss said.
Lauren Dawson, a junior majoring in international relations and neuroscience, said the discussion was positive for the audience as well.
“I was really glad that the panelists were so open about sharing their experiences. There was some self-reflection among the panelists and that was really interesting to witness,” Dawson said.
Despite discussing some difficulties of being gay and in the Greek system, all of the panelists agreed that they would rush and join the same house if they could do it again.
[…] in the Greek community. Although students of the panel say they would rush again, the Daily Trojan reports that Greeks and the LGBT community are still at […]

Junior Lisa McCloskey and the No. 2 USC women’s golf team had a day for the record books Wednesday at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to push the Women of Troy past No. 5 California and into first place.
So close · Junior Lisa McCloskey’s 8-under final round helped USC set a team record 13-under (275) round, but it wasn’t enough for the win. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
McCloskey, a transfer from Pepperdine, has played only three matches with the Women of Troy to make her mark on the team. She fired a final round 8-under-par 64 to finish tied for fourth at 5-under-par 211 (72-75-64).
Eight-under ties McCloskey with Irene Cho’s second-round 64 at the Guadalajara Invitational in 2006. McCloskey opened the final round with a bogey before making three birdies on the front nine and six birdies on the back nine, including four birdies on her final five holes.
“It feels really good after having a mediocre round [Tuesday],” McCloskey said. “Just a real solid round with lots of greens and few putts.”
McCloskey’s final round pushed USC to a final round of 13-under-par 275, the lowest round in team history. In the end, however, the Women of Troy finished second at 15-under-par 849 (285-289-275), two strokes behind Cal at 17-under-par 847 (284-283-280). The final round of 13-under is three strokes better than the previous low, set two weeks ago in the final round of the Mason Rudolph Championship. That marks two straight record-setting final rounds for the Women of Troy.
“I think it’s great to close a tournament strong, but we’ve got to lower our scoring averages for the first two rounds,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said. “[Yesterday], we didn’t have anyone do poorly, but we didn’t have any great scores. You need everybody playing well and have one or two that play extremely well.”
The team certainly had two players playing extremely well in McCloskey and senior Lizette Salas. Even with McCloskey’s record-setting round, Salas bested her on the leader board, finishing in second place at 7-under-par 209 (71-71-67). Six birdies successfully offset one bogey on her way to her second top-three finish of the year.
Freshman Sophia Popov tied for fifth at 2-under-par 214 (68-74-72). Popov had three bogeys balanced by three birdies while bouncing back from her season debut, where she finished 67th.
Sophomore Inah Park had a career-best finish for the Women of Troy, tying for 11th at 3-over-par 219 (74-71-74). Her five birdies were cancelled out by six bogeys and a double bogey on the first hole.
Sophomore Cyna Rodriguez finished tied for 16th at 5-over-par 221 (76-73-72). Rodriguez had five birdies and five bogeys, with four of those birdies on the back nine.
The Women of Troy now have a month before competing again at the Pac-10/SEC Challenge at the Stanford Golf Club in Palo Alto, Calif.
“We’re looking forward to hitting some teams from the South,” Gaston said. “We need to catch up on classes right now.”

Even though the Trojans lost, I saw something impressive in the Coliseum Saturday.
It wasn’t Washington quarterback Jake Locker.
On-field struggles · Senior kicker Joe Houston has struggled on the field, going 2-for-6 this year, but he carries himself well off it. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
It was USC senior kicker Joe Houston.
When USC fans think of Houston, they probably want to march onto the Trojans’ practice field, line up and attempt a field goal right in front of USC coach Lane Kiffin.
The last time USC fans saw Houston, there was 2:34 left in the fourth quarter against Washington last weekend. With USC up 31-29, sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley had just missed a pass to senior tight end Jordan Cameron that would’ve given the Trojans a first down inside the Washington 20-yard line. So, on fourth-and-four, Kiffin sent Houston out to attempt a 40-yard field goal that would give USC a five-point lead, thus forcing Washington to score a touchdown to win.
This is Houston’s first season as a full-time kicker for the Trojans. At the start of the year, Kiffin awarded Houston a scholarship for his dedication and hard work. For Houston, it was a dream come true knowing his hard work had paid off.
But the senior hasn’t performed to his or his coach’s expectations. As he lined up for the 40-yard field goal, Houston was just 2-for-5 kicking the ball between the uprights during the year, but he did make his last kick, a 27-yarder earlier in the quarter to give the Trojans the 31-29 lead.
The ball was snapped, and Houston made clean contact with it. He followed through and looked up at the most important kick of his life.
His heart sank as it trailed off to the right and hit the upright.
Washington got the ball back, converted a fourth-and-11 opportunity and ripped off a 26-yard run before kicking the game-winning field goal as time expired.
As the Huskies danced and shouted on the Coliseum floor, the Trojans sprinted off into the locker room, including Houston, who still had his helmet on.
Instead of making a quick exit while all the reporters were in the press conference room, Houston stuck around. About an hour after the game ended, just about all the players were on the bus when Houston came out of the locker room.
He wasn’t wearing big headphones or walking up the tunnel with his head down. He could’ve sprinted past the reporters like Locker sprinted past USC’s secondary, and nobody would have blamed him. When a reporter asked if he could talk to him, he said, “hold on,” and continued up the ramp. Apparently, he wanted to be left alone and who could fault him for that?
Except then, he put his bags down and stood there like a man knowing the gallows wait for him. He crossed his arms, straightened his back and put a brave look on his face.
The reporters closed in, and for about three minutes, he stood there and answered all questions, almost coming to tears at one point. Here’s a guy who’s never been in the spotlight before and all of the sudden he’s saying he’s “responsible” for USC’s loss.
I don’t agree with his assessment. The defense played awful, and Barkley missed two passes he should have completed that would’ve most likely won the game. What stood out to me was Houston’s character.
To stand in front of a dozen reporters — just an hour after missing the biggest kick of his life — and to relive that moment takes more courage than the Wizard of Oz granted the Cowardly Lion. Some people might say that it’s the athlete’s responsibility to answer questions in the good times and the bad, and for the most part, I agree with that.
But this is different. Houston is not an every-down star player used to media attention and who makes mistakes more often simply because he is on the field more. As a field goal kicker, Houston is almost expected to make every field goal, and many fans don’t even take notice unless those kicks start to miss. That’s a tough way to live.
Imagine if you failed your first midterm or wrecked your parent’s car and then had reporters show up and grill you about it. I know I wouldn’t want a microphone thrust in my face.
Still, Houston stood in there and shared his true feelings. He said he was hurt and felt terrible.
Say what you want about Houston’s kicking abilities. He’s now 2-for-6 and his coach has lost faith in him, opening up his position. Kiffin is giving senior punter Jacob Harfman a chance at kicking field goals this week, and whoever does better will play Saturday.
But don’t question his character. He’s about as mentally tough as they come. His teammates were behind him, chanting his name and encouraging him while he kicked against Harfman in practice Tuesday.
Houston may or may not have lost the game Saturday — that is up for debate. But he won over the respect of at least one reporter.

After failing to avenge a tough 2009 loss last week, USC gets another crack at it Saturday against No. 16 Stanford.
Too much · Stanford and running back Toby Gerhart ran all over USC last year at the Coliseum and punctuated it with a two-point conversion late in the fourth quarter with the game out of reach. The Trojans haven’t forgotten about that controversial attempt by Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
The Cardinal subjected the Trojans to perhaps their most embarrassing loss of last year, a 55-21 thrashing at the Coliseum. Already 1-1 in Pac-10 play after falling to Washington, the Trojans are looking for a road victory against one of the conference’s top teams to try to get back on track.
“Coming off a loss like that at home, I think the best thing to do is go into a hostile environment where it’s just our team and fight one out,” redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo said.
Senior linebacker Michael Morgan agreed.
“I know it’s a big game and we’ve got a lot at stake right now,” Morgan said.
On top of not wanting to fall further behind in the Pac-10 standings, the Trojans might have a little extra motivation built up for the Cardinal. The most notable moment of last year’s beat down came when Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh elected to go for two with his team leading 48-21 midway through the fourth quarter.
Harbaugh’s move led to an exchange of words with former USC coach Pete Carroll after the game. Both coaches played it politically correct in press conferences afterward, but USC players understood the message.
“Yeah, that was tough. That was last year,” Morgan said. “We didn’t forget about it. I will remind you that we didn’t forget about it but we’re gonna come out and try to dominate.
“Hey, it’s part of football,” he said “They did it, they’ll have to pay for it.”
USC will enter the game as an underdog for the first time this season. Any hopes of upending Stanford at home will start with slowing down the Cardinal’s physical offensive attack, led by running back Stepfan Taylor and quarterback Andrew Luck.
It won’t be a question of figuring out what Stanford is going to do. Galippo said the Cardinal make that very clear.
“They overload one side of the line and they just say, ‘Hey, we’re running the ball right here, try and stop us,’” Galippo said. “So, yeah, it’s going to be a heck of a challenge.”
Out of all the statistical categories the USC defense ranks poorly in, run defense is at least the lesser of the evils. The Trojans rank 44th nationally against the run, while their pass defense is 116th.
Morgan said he believes the defense will be up to the challenge.
“They’re gonna line up in ace and jumbo packages and run the ball straight at you,” he said. “We feel like that’s one of our strengths and we’ll have to be ready for it.”    u
As USC coach Lane Kiffin looks to solve the Trojans’ kicking dilemma, he was not encouraged by the results from Wednesday’s practice.
Senior kicker Joe Houston and senior punter Jacob Harfman combined to go 0-for-6 on field goals in the 35- to 45-yard range in the kicking portion of practice. Houston is 2-for-6 on field goals tries this season, while Harfman, the punter, has not attempted a kick this season.
Kiffin said the competition was ongoing and that he was “extremely” concerned about the kicking game.
“If you go a whole period of field goal opportunities and you don’t make one, that would concern me a lot,” he said.
 
IF we can win this one, everyone will forget UW….
Coach, Pat, JK, somewhere on that campus is a walk-on just waiting to walk on.  He can kick off into the end zone, punt for distance and hang-time, and his best pal did 50 yard field goals regularly for his dinky, unknown high school way out there in the boonies.  Who are these guys?  Where are these guys on campus?  Never mind how we got the kicking game we have.  Keep putting the word out and the local talent will step up…scholarships to be discussed.
GO STANFORD!
The nation’s best combination of athletic and academic success.
New Jersey,
You forgot the arrogant asshole part. And that is not even mentioning Hairball.

Prior to the Sept. 29 screening of I Am on campus, director Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Evan Almighty) addressed the audience. He asked all the film students present to remove their metaphorical film critic hats. This is his first documentary, he said, so cut him a little slack.
Fix the world · The  movie’s interviews show varying views on life, poverty and faith. - Photo courtesy of Shady Acres 
That wasn’t necessary. I Am is a fine documentary with an uplifting message that sets it apart from its contemporaries.
In 2007, Shadyac tumbled off his bicycle and onto his head. It wasn’t his first concussion, but this time the symptoms didn’t go away. Doctors diagnosed him with post-concussion syndrome, and he was in such a constant pain that although he was never suicidal, he felt his own mortality.
He asked himself what conversation he would like to have with the world if he were about to die. He wanted to know, “What’s wrong with our world and what can we do about it?”
Once he healed enough to endure air travel, he visited almost 20 people from different fields, including activist Noam Chomsky, historian Howard Zinn, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Shadyac’s father Richard, the former CEO of St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, the interview filmed before his death.
With the help of his interview subjects, Shadyac explains that poverty and war aren’t to blame. Those are the symptoms caused by a larger problem: human nature.
Shadyac argues that in the years since Charles Darwin first published Descent of Man, he’s been badly misinterpreted, with people thinking that survival of the fittest justifies competition. Therefore, it’s OK to strive to have more material belongings, more wealth and more junk while people sleep under the I-405. The collective shrug over that inequity comes from mankind’s belief that the have-nots just didn’t try hard enough.
According to Shadyac, this wasn’t really Darwin’s point. He and his interviewees stress that Darwin wrote about love and community more than survival of the fittest. The strongest human instinct, he surmised, is sympathy.
If it all sounds a little new age, Shadyac knows that. He offers examples of community and sympathy in nature. The most memorable one comes when he visits the Heartmath Institute in California. Senior researcher Rollin McCraty plugs electrodes into a Petri dish full of yogurt and has Shadyac talk about things that upset him. As he speaks to McCraty about his lawyer, his agent and his ex-wife, the electrodes measure strong reactions in the yogurt even though Shadyac is physically separated from both the electrodes and the yogurt.
This isn’t science fiction, Shadyac argues. It’s not new age either. It’s human. Humans affect each other and nature, and if everyone could just get along, the world would be a better place.
I Am delivers this message without becoming too preachy. Shadyac achieves this in part by stepping back from the film. Although his journey provides the impetus for the story, he allows his subjects to expound the larger lessons of this film.
Shadyac popped up occasionally, mostly to bridge together topics or drive home his themes. At the outset of the film, he asked his guests if they’ve ever seen Ace Ventura. Most hadn’t, and Shadyac highlighted that these people aren’t just his friends, giving their opinions more credence. Later, he revisited his enormous Pasadena mansion that he sold before moving into a motor home park in North Malibu with the hopes of living a simpler life. He did it, Shadyac seems to say, and everyone else can too.
Shadyac smartly uses more than just his interviews to tell his story. Fun bits of animation serve the same purpose. In one, he illustrates how scientific theory changed so much over the last millennium. In another, he shows how even Albert Einstein expressed confusion over how some atomic particles continued to act the same even when separated by “infinite distances.”
It’s easy to question if Shadyac manipulated his footage, particularly in the case of empathic yogurt. In another instance, he said he only asked his subjects, “What’s wrong with the world, and what can we do about it?”
Yet they talk so long on so many different subjects, he undoubtedly had an actual conversation with the people he interviewed after he asked those questions.
In the post-screening Q&A, Shadyac said he’s only interested in the truth, and that’s all he represented. Shadyac seems genuine enough both in the film and in person that those small blemishes don’t detract from I Am. It’s an uplifting experience that changes the question. It’s not about what’s wrong with the world, it’s what’s right with it. And answer lies in the title: I Am (you are).
[…] It wasn’t his first concussion, but this time the symptoms didn’t go away. … Make sure to check out the original source              Cancel […]

Santa Monica’s Ocean Avenue is the epitome of the mythical Southern California lifestyle we like to dream about: sand, surfers and shopping. Nestled amid all the tan bodies, however, is an unlikely bastion of East Coast summer food, Blue Plate Oysterette, a deceptively casual seafood joint that serves up artful bites of the Atlantic seaboard.
Upon entering the kitschy, bright, ocean-facing restaurant, one immediately feels like they have stepped into a stylish aunt’s beach house. The restaurant is swathed in cool blues, fun stripes and touches of tawdry seashell knick-knacks,  and topped off with a central bar and open kitchen proudly displaying a large blackboard of the day’s fresh specials.
The Oysterette offers a decent raw bar with oysters, ceviche, crudo and prawns, and even gives the exact species of some of the items. Those unfamiliar with the intricacies of frutti del mare need not worry, however — servers are more than willing to brief eaters on the differences between sizes, textures and flavors of those tricky-looking bivalves that many shy away from because, well, they’re weird.
Many less adventurous diners don’t order oysters because of past terrible experiences. “They’re slimy,” they say wearily. “And gray,” they add with disgust. But that’s what happens when the only interaction they’ve had with the famously finicky protein is from bad hotel brunches where the oysters have been sloppily chopped from some crate taken off a dirty truck. Most people, sadly, have only tasted the cheap stuff.
This is not the case at Blue Plate Oysterette. Oysters are the restaurant’s stars. The place is named for them, after all.
The reputedly aphrodasiacal creatures are served on ice. They’re fresh, taste like what the ocean should and although they’re not exactly an economical purchase, they’re an enjoyable luxury served without all the pretentiousness of a traditional fine-dining restaurant.
The Oysterette’s the kind of place where you can walk in with sandy flip flops, slurp straight from the shell and unashamedly chase oysters and vinegar with some Perrier.
It’s not just oysters that make the restaurant unforgettable, however. Dishes like steamed mussels, when they have them, turn even the most picky of eaters into bowl-licking beasts. Perfect little packages of salty-sweet heaven bathing in the ultimate creamy white wine sauce, the mussels also come with some good old-fashioned grilled toast that absorbs sauce like a dream.
The ultimate Maine seafood dish is here too; the respectable lobster roll might not look like much, but once bitten it’s an instant trip to Bar Harbor.
With generous mayonnaise and a fresh — but not overpowering — dollop of tarragon, the densely-packed lobster filling heaped into a buttered and browned brioche will make a delightfully messy meal. Feel free to stuff the homemade sweet potato chips the sandwich comes with in the already-overstuffed bun for a satisfying crunch that cuts through that creamy-savory-fresh-butter taste for a symphony of seafood.
Eaters be warned, however. The sandwich is good, but it isn’t cheap: expect to be set back $22 for an indulgent, thoroughly nostalgic entrée.
Blue Plate Oysterette, however, knows that it’s very much still on the West Coast. Dishes like the fish tacos with grilled mahi-mahi, cilantro aioli, guacamole and crisp cabbage tastes like quintessential California.
If you could create a flavor that could combine the smell of ocean winds, the sight of Westsiders rollerblading and the feeling you get speeding down a traffic-free PCH with all the windows down, these tacos would be it. Regrettably, they’re not as authentically Mexican as your neighborhood hole-in-the-wall joint that hand-makes their tortillas from masa and lard, but the quality of the fish makes up for that in leaps and bounds.
A seared ahi sandwich with tarragon aioli, arugula and onions is also served on brioche here — another remarkably Californian dish that holds its own against the East-coast items. It’s crisp, tasteful and simple — the way a sandwich should be.
Non-pescatarians shouldn’t feel completely out of place here, however. The menu still has items like macaroni and cheese, a burger and grilled chicken. But seafood remains the heart and soul of the Oysterette’s vision.
Though it’s homey and light in spirit, don’t expect to step out having spent lightly. It’s a definite extravagance, but the atmosphere, polite service and most of all brilliant food evokes an endless summer that’s filled with sun, sea and seafood.

Going to college is like breaking out of your parents’ house and skydiving into Neverland — an entirely new environment where no one will nag about bedtimes, vegetables or homework.
Freshly set loose from high school, many students start leaning back on a cycle of late-night runs to Denny’s, weekend partying and peanut M&M’s for breakfast. Months later, they return home a few sizes bigger — another victim of the dreaded Freshman 15.
Custom built - O2 MAX's programs revolve around exercise plans based on individual needs, and are overseen by personal trainers. - Photo courtesy of O2 MAX
It’s a common scenario 33-year-old USC alumna Karen Jashinsky can identify with and one that gave her the insight that sometimes students just need a firm kick in the butt to guide them back to a healthy lifestyle.
Jashinsky aims to be that guiding hand. She is the founder of O2 MAX Fitness, a youth fitness and media company that launched a new program tailored toward college students — MAX U — less than a month ago.
Ever since she discovered the gym in high school and realized just how much she enjoyed working out, Jashinsky has always been active. As soon as she got her driver’s license, she was driving herself to the gym each night, spending about two hours there to relieve the stress and tension of the day.
But then she went to college. Though she tried to stay active, Jashinsky still gained some unwanted pounds because she had a hard time balancing a healthy lifestyle with her busy schedule.
“I would have late nights when I would just eat from the bakery,” Jashinsky said. “I just felt really yucky when I returned home, and I wanted to get healthy and in shape again.”
That summer at home, she met with a personal trainer for the first time. Working with a professional helped Jashinsky build back not just her previous physique but fresh motivation and passion for fitness. She started asking her trainer various questions, learning about different workout programs and how to properly put them together to build maximum fitness.
By the time Jashinsky moved to Los Angeles to attend graduate school at USC’s Marshall School of Business, she was working as a personal trainer to pay her tuition. It was then that she gained the inspiration to start her business through her clients.
Some of her early clients were parents who voiced their concern about the rising child obesity epidemic and the lack of physical education in schools. Meanwhile, many of her clients who graduated from high school and went to college came home out of shape. They worked hard to shed the Freshman 15 all summer, Jashinsky said, only to return to college and gain it all back.
“That’s when I realized that there’s a bigger opportunity out there helping college students,” Jashinsky said. “College students have the hardest time because they don’t have a lot of time, and they tend to party a lot in the weekends. They struggle with fitting workouts into their schedule and making better food choices, and they don’t have a lot of money [to pay a personal trainer].”
Thus, Jashinsky decided to combine her love for fitness, her college experience and her master’s degree in entrepreneurship to develop a fitness program for students that is easy to follow, inexpensive and convenient.
Students sign up for a $50 12-week program and receive a package containing a workout plan, nutritional guide, grocery and snack lists, and free samples and discounts to partner companies.
In addition, students can also set up weekly coaching sessions with professional trainers who will guide them in their workout and nutrition plans through e-mails, phone calls or texting. The trainers will help the student adjust their workouts to fit their needs, so that they can either log an hour-long session at the gym, or take several 15-minute exercise bursts within their dorm rooms during finals week.
“We’re basically always at your service,” Jashinsky said. “You can check in with us whenever you have a question or need help with something.”
But there will be no slacking off in this program. Part of the purpose behind these weekly sessions is for the coach to check up on the student, like a parent making sure that their child did his homework.
“If we don’t hear from you, we’re going to bother you to make sure you’re doing something,” Jashinsky said. “We will keep up with you and hold you accountable.”
And that seems to be precisely what many college students need to jumpstart their fitness routine.
Shawna Heinz, a freshman majoring in accounting, was having trouble with consistence and motivation in her workouts. But being determined to avoid the Freshman 15 “at all costs,” Heinz found her solution when she signed up for O2 MAX’s college fitness program.
“It’s so convenient,” Heinz said. “The coach will just tell me what to do, adjusting the workout plan according to my schedule and what I can do, and I simply follow it.”
Heinz only joined the program two weeks ago, but is already seeing benefits.
“I have more motivation now,” Heinz said. “And I am starting to realize how important being healthy and fit is. [O2 MAX is] there to always motivate me, and the things that they tell me to do is so manageable that I don’t have a problem accomplishing the task.”
O2 MAX has changed Heinz’s perspective on healthy lifestyles, she said. It wasn’t just so much about avoiding the Freshman 15 anymore, but relishing the feeling of being strong and healthy enough to achieve her goals and pursue her passions.
“It makes me feel good that I’m dong something for myself, accomplishing tasks and just being healthy,” she said. “It makes me feel so much better about myself, and each day goes so much better.”

Coffee is undoubtedly a fundamental part of American culture today, particularly among young people. In fact, the National Coffee Association of USA found that the 18- to 24-year-old demographic is continuing to drink more coffee every year. Consumption of coffee by the same demographic in 2005 averaged about 2.5 cups a day. That number grew to 3.2 cups a day in 2008, a noteworthy increase.

Take a drive through Los Angeles and you’ll see signs of our increasing infatuation with all things tall, dark and caffeinated: Starbucks sitting happily on adjacent city blocks, denizens in designer sunglasses with organically produced $5 lattes and even McDonald’s billboards hawking gourmet espresso drinks. The temple of blue-collar mass-produced American eats producing fancy-shmancy caramel macchi-whatevers? Just another sign of the times, it seems.
Coffee culture has spread like wildfire in recent years, with no sign of going out any time soon. Still, it’s really nothing new. Coffeehouses came into vogue around the 15th century in Constantinople, present-day Istanbul. These coffee joints weren’t just places to get a morning buzz; they were also hubs of intellectual discussion and artistic expression.
Today’s coffeehouses might not seem like hangouts for the philosophical, Jean-Paul Sartre types, but they’re still nice places to spend some time and engage in a stimulating conversation or two.
It’s not hard to find examples on USC’s very own campus. Tucked between Marks Tower and the wings of Trojan Hall, Ground Zero Performance Café is a popular coffeehouse that’s also a widely used performance venue, playing host to everything from a cappella performances to improv comedy to open mic nights. Nick Wright, a junior majoring in chemical engineering was there on a chilly and drizzling Monday afternoon.
“It’s pretty laid back and there’s usually good music going on or some other event,” Wright said. “It’s nice to have some place that’s not so formal or stuffy.”
The café was filled with people, some who were merely escaping the rain but also others who seemed to be regulars. Laptops were logged in, drinks were in hand and legitimate group studying was happening.
It’s this social, homey characteristic of many coffeehouses that seems to attract so many people. What’s even more curious is that this comfortable atmosphere is so very often an essential component of coffeehouses, and not other types of establishments. Food-focused eateries don’t seem to encourage this sort of innocuous loitering and libraries certainly don’t create the same kind of feeling. So what brings it all together?
It’s difficult to pinpoint. Part of the explanation is that coffee in the past decade somehow became trendy and hip. And hipness tends to breed socialization — there’s nothing like communicating with others of similar ideologies and lifestyles. The trend originally began around the mid-20th century, in places like the Pacific Northwest and in towns like New York’s Greenwich Village. Advocates of counterculture would congregate in such coffeehouses, meaning participating in coffee culture became a lifestyle decision.
Lifestyle. That’s the key word behind today’s coffee culture. Not only is coffee from a premium coffeehouse more delicious, but it seems to subconsciously signify a lifestyle that cares about quality, local community and socialization. The irony behind this is that coffee culture today has more to do with standardization, the mainstream and increased profits more than ever before. Thankfully, local coffee joints continue to thrive — including on campus.
Freshman Brian Thompson, a barista at the Shop Café near the Roski School of Fine Arts, smiled when the idea of coffee being hip was brought up.
“I believe some people are truly passionate about their coffee, but I do believe that it’s kind of trendy,” he said. “[Customers] are willing to pay a higher price for coffee — partially cause of marketing, but, well, I believe in quality and people definitely like to drink more than just ‘coffee’ — the flavored lattes and things.”
Coffeehouses aren’t just about the atmosphere, it’s still about how good the coffee is — even if some major chains might not reflect that — and campus has its ups and downs.
Trojan Grounds, colloquially known as “TroGro,” is popular because of its 24/7 operating hours, with every snack, from roasted nuts to microwave burritos, available all the time, along with various coffee drinks. It seems constantly busy, which might account for the terrible coffee.
Drinks from TroGro consistently have miscues, including bitter, overdrawn espresso to other issues such as the insistent overuse of flavored syrups. After all, who wants a solid puck of caramel syrup at the bottom of their cup?
The new Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center also suffers from long lines, which could explain its underachieving coffee as well. Milk for lattes gets over-steamed, leaving the resulting drink watery and astringent instead of velvety and rich. There’s very rarely the necessary head of creamy milk froth; instead, you might get a lonesome island of bubbly looking milk suds.
This is surprising considering the high quality (and tasty) product coming out from behind the counter of the other Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, located inside the School of Cinematic Arts. It’s unfortunate that this new branch falls into the stereotype of franchises: premium prices, not-so-premium drinks.
Thankfully there is one particular local café that outshines the rest.
The aforementioned Shop Café, located between the Roski Fine Arts building and the School of Architecture, is a coffee stop that all others on or near campus should measure up to (that means you too, University Village Starbucks). Premium Ghirardelli sauces sit happily alongside expensive Monin flavoring syrups (much better than the cheaper, ubiquitous Torani brand). Gleaming, Italian-made La Marzocco espresso machines pump out silky, deep-flavored espresso. Thick, subtly sweet steamed milk is free-poured from the pitcher, leaving behind a topping of foam streaked and flavored by the coffee itself. Decent places like Ground Zero pale in comparison.
Granted, there aren’t soft couches to sit and surf the Internet on, and if the weather is unusually bad, the outside seating areas are no help at all. But the drinks themselves are certainly worth taking elsewhere.
It’s pretty clear that our growing coffee culture, for all it’s worth, wouldn’t exist without the actual beverage. Having a good drink, then, might be the most important factor of all.

Is there hope for philanthropic organizations during a time when people seem less able to make charitable donations?
The USC Good Neighbors Campaign, which supports university-funded neighborhood projects, answered that question with a resounding yes; it raised $1.2 million from USC faculty and staff contributions last year, a record amount since the campaign started 15 years ago.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
“Under those [economic] circumstances, we could have fallen short of our goal,” President C.L. Max Nikias said at the President’s Distinguished Leadership Circle dinner on Sept. 21, according to USC News. “Instead, we surpassed everyone’s expectations.”
The Good Neighbors Campaign is on the move to call more and more students to participate in meaningful community service during their college career, an undertaking which should prove beneficial to both students and community.
This year, the campaign wants to set the bar even higher at $1.3 million. The utilization of an effective, innovative and free social media tool should help them meet that goal.
That tool is called YouTube.
A video posted two weeks ago by Thomas Sayles — USC vice president of government and civic engagement and co-chair of the 2010 Good Neighbors Campaign — shows testimony from numerous USC staff and faculty involved in this community partnership.
The campaign’s fundamental goal speaks to the heart of one of the university’s missions in the Nikias administration: to improve the quality of life in our surrounding community.
Since its founding in 1995, the campaign has raised more than $11 million from faculty and staff donors.
As valuable as these donations are to the success of the program, the campaign video goes further to portray a perspective from those involved in the organization on both a personal and a professional level.
By doing so, campaign participants can see that their time and resources impact social change in our surrounding community.
“I intimately know how it felt growing up in the community around USC,” said one campaign participant in the video. “The Good Neighbors Campaign is a good deed.”
As the video highlights certain areas surrounding the campus, one can see just how explicitly the community is asking for our help. And we have answered the call.
After-school teaching programs, robotics competitions and health fairs provided by the generous contributions and efforts of campaign participants have all improved the lives of many students and their families.
In reference to a Good Neighbors after-school initiative, one contributor said, “There are 40 kids who would otherwise be out in the street. This year there’s 40 kids who are in this loving, nurturing environment that’s redefining what their future possibilities are.”
But if there is one audience that the campaign video seeks to reach, it is undoubtedly Trojan students.
Although USC’s renowned Good Neighbors organization is typically funded by university staff and faculty contributions, the video makes it clear that students are equal stakeholders in the future success of the program. Their time and energy in this campaign is just as vital as the dollars poured into the program by countless donors.
Many students might feel so comfortable with their campus privileges that they forget the condition of the community surrounding them. They aren’t alone.
In the same video, one student in the pharmacy school said, “I always feel like, as a USC student, I’m very fortunate. We have great staff here, people who take care of us. And yet, I forget sometimes … that there are people who need us.”
Admittedly, other student organizations also do their part to advance the quality of our community.
Fraternities, sororities, political organizations, religious clubs and academic associations all play an active role in giving back to a cause greater than themselves.
Imagine that all of those organizations came together, worked alongside supportive faculty and staff and utilized their respective skills for the advancement of one cause. Surely we would send an even more favorable message to the community — that USC as a whole is engaged in improving the well-being of its local residents.
“We’ve become somewhat of a model for universities because of the Good Neighbors Campaign,” said another video participant. “We are engaging the community around us and making them feel a part of USC. We are one community.”
As USC students, we are on our way to redefining what it means to attain a college education during these times. Apart from hitting the books, we might also learn that part of our education means giving a little of our time to help shape our community just as it shapes us during our college years.
“Under the leadership of President Nikias, we will take the campaign to new heights,” said a campaign contributer in the video.
Under the leadership of students, the sky is the limit.

As members of a worldly and affluent university, it would have been hard for even the most politically disinclined of students not to hear about “maidgate”.
As if the gubernatorial races hadn’t already given us enough to think about amid the debates and name-calling, the recent scandal involving Meg Whitman and her former housekeeper Nicandra Diaz-Santillan has turned this year’s elections into a nail-biting political drama.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred, Diaz-Santillan is claiming that after admitting to Whitman that she was an illegal alien, she was fired in a phone call with the Republican GOP candidate saying, “From now on you don’t know me and I don’t know you. You never have seen me and I have never seen you. Do you understand me?”
And besides claims of Whitman’s “abuse,” including not paying her for extra hours and mileage for out-of-house errands, Diaz-Santillan is also alleging that Whitman knew about her illegal status all along. Whitman, of course, is denying all this.
People are now crying hypocrisy as they realize the inconsistency between her employment of an undocumented worker and her anti-immigrant policies.
America’s Voice, an advocacy group for immigration reform, has released what is called the “Whitman vs. Whitman on Immigration Report”, illustrating her “Tough as Nails” radio advertisement where she promises to “create an economic fence to crack down on employers who break the law by using illegal labor,” and her assurances that she respects the Latino community.
And so the question arises — truth or cover-up? Whitman said she would submit to taking a polygraph test, but they aren’t known for their accurate track records.
What we as students can do in the meantime besides twiddling our thumbs is to consider the implications of this scandal and how it will change our opinions of Whitman, or even our votes.
Furthermore, we should consider the lack of rhetorical consistency in Whitman’s campaign and hopefully not succumb to the same hypocrisy in our college papers, future lives and more.
The first thing we need to understand is that no one makes it out of these types of situations without repercussions.
If Whitman’s defenses are true, Diaz-Santillan faces possible deportation and Whitman loses the support of the Latino community.
If Diaz-Santillan’s allegations are true, Whitman could face penalties for knowingly hiring an illegal worker (and the maid once again faces possible deportation.)
Which result would we prefer to see and what should we take into account when choosing a side?
Is it continually believing that Whitman could not have possibly known about Diaz-Santillan — though a copy of a Social Security letter notifying her that her housekeeper’s documentation had problems has surfaced — and that Diaz-Santillan might only be looking for her 15 minutes of fame? Is it supporting a tough, no-amnesty approach to penalizing the two parties for each committed criminal acts — one illegal immigrant and one employing an illegal immigrant?
Either way, Whitman’s defenses are becoming tiring and almost comical. In one gubernatorial debate, Jerry Brown said,“Don’t run for governor if you can’t stand on our own two feet and say ‘Hey I made a mistake.’” If Whitman did so, she’d seem more like a candidate that we can all relate to and vote for.
Observing how political rhetoric often diminishes our belief in a figure should also reflects on our ability to speak, teaching us how not to argue a point.
Besides the lack of consistency between Whitman’s proposed reforms and her alleged actions, her support for Arizona’s SB 1070 is questionable as well. She claims that she supports Arizona’s push for this type of reform but would not implement the same kind of legislation in California. In the same vein, the Obama administration argued that the border was secure, yet to increase higher ratings, it sent troops to enforce already enforced rules.
Instead of accepting these political tactics, we should find ways to express our genuine opinions and not satisfy a group for the sake of losing credibility altogether. We should all remember — words will bite you back.

For those not aware, LACMA has been putting together a splendid series of classic film screenings hosted by the 20th Anniversary Tribute to The Film Foundation, and this Saturday they are showing an absolute gem: Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s The Red Shoes.
I know, I know, I already wrote about The Red Shoes in the past, but all that means is that now you have a chance to see it for yourself — and in glorious 35 mm.
Not to sound like an unpaid spokesman for LACMA, but The Red Shoes is a cinematic experience that can only be fully appreciated on the big screen, in full living color. I could write a book describing the film’s artistic brilliance, but now I’m online, which means I can insert links. So I’ll just get out of the way and let you see a clip of it for yourself.

The California state senate released details of the 2011 budget today, which lawmakers will vote to finalize on Thursday.
The proposal is 98 days late, as it was supposed to be finalized 100 days before it would be voted on.
It proposes that the state’s current $19-billion deficit be reduced with $5 billion from the federal government as a bailout, $3 billion taken from the school system, $1.5 billion from state employee salaries and other cost-cutting measures.
The $3 billion less to schools is also an accounting move, the LA Times reported, as half of the money will have to be paid off next year.
Although the bill does not propose any new taxes, it would get rid of a current a tax break, bringing in $1.2 billion more next year.
The proposed budget also increases the “rainy day fund” that that state can use for emergency deficits, from 5 percent of general revenue brought in to 10 percent.

California driver licenses have received a face-lift, the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles announced today.
The new California license.
In an effort to better protect against fraud, tampering and counterfeiting, the licenses — unveiled today at a press conference in South Sacramento — were redesigned with additional security features.
“The new security features, coupled with advanced technology, make California driver licenses and identification cards one of the most secure identification documents in the country,” said DMV Director George Valverde, per a DMV press release. “We are confident that they will be well-received by residents, businesses and law enforcement officials.”
The new license for those under age 21.
The information on the cards will remain the same, but they feature new elements. Images will be added that can only be seen using ultraviolet lights, a laser outline of the California Brown Bear will be included on the front of the card that can only be seen when a flashlight is pressed against the back of the license, and the birthday and signature of the cardholder will be able to be felt by touch. Additionally, licenses for people under the age of 21 will move to a vertical layout — a measure several other states have in place.
Officials said this is the first major revision of state driver licenses and identification cards since 2001.
Although new cards were issued earlier this week, existing driver license or ID holders will not be required to get a new card until their current one expires.
An example of the new driver’s license can be found here.
Images of the new under-21 I.D. card can be found here.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill into law last week that will alter the recruiting process for California coaches and universities.
The law, known as the Student-Athletes’ Right to Know Act, requires coaches to reveal to prospect student-athletes institutional and NCAA policies on medical expenses, scholarship renewals and transfers.
Supporters hope this law will hold universities accountable for the promises their coaches make to prospects.  In addition, the act will allow athletes and their families to be more informed when deciding to accept or reject an athletic scholarship.
Those who oppose the bill feel it will place unnecessary burdens on coaches and universities.
The law will also require universities to admit to prospects the small probability of having a professional career in sports.
“This law is a milestone in college athletes’ struggle to secure basic protections,” Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, said in an e-mail to the The Chronicle of Higher Education. “This is only the beginning. We will take this fight to other states next year.”
