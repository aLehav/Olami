To hear your name repeated back to you, in its correct pronunciation, is one of the simplest, yet most powerful, forms of acknowledgment. It is an indication of effort on the speaker’s part to respect and recognize who you are. 
In the wake of the tragedy of the Atlanta shootings on March 16, the Asian American women — whose lives were prematurely taken in a senseless act of violence — were not even afforded the basic dignity of being remembered in the media by their full names, much less their correct pronunciations.
It may not have been intentional for many news outlets, but the lack of research and consultation with cultural leaders was seen throughout communities as deliberate. To remember these women, the extra step — to recognize them as human beings and acknowledge who they are, their culture included — is not such a difficult thing to ask. 
Last week, Portland protesters standing in solidarity against the rise in AAPI hate rallied behind the phrase, “Learn our names.” This is after major news networks such as the Washington Post released initial details of the Atlanta spa shooting victims with abridged names in print, later amending their publication after facing public scrutiny. The names of the victims were shortened according to American naming customs — this being the common practice of including first name, middle initial and last name. 
It is altogether understandable how this happened, but the ‘why’ should be of concern to us all.
Arguably, it has become second nature for the majority, if not all, of the American public to acknowledge a name or a culture so long as it requires little effort on our part. I have seen it, I have experienced it, and truly, my story is one of privilege because of where I come from. 
I went to high school in the San Gabriel Valley in a neighborhood that was predominantly Asian American. That being the case, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard classmates and close friends of mine forego their given name and adopt a new one for the sake of everyone around them. This is a personal decision that I cannot rightly speak to, but as someone who holds a Eurocentric name, it is my responsibility — as it is the responsibility of countless others — to free this decision from the influence of peer pressure or assimilationist attitudes. 
In my own story, I was given two first names, as is the custom in the Philippines. This tradition stems from the desire to honor the mother’s maiden name by giving it as a middle name, and that was exactly what my parents intended when they named me. 
My name is Spanish due to the colonization of the Philippines, and, in the culture of Southern California, it has never presented me with any problems. At most, it is subjectively seen as an inconvenience for government agencies when I fill out official documents, but I still count myself as privileged. 
I don’t always like the fact that my name comes with complications, but if I were to choose, I would still honor my mom’s maiden name because of its meaning.
In any situation, the space and dialogue of our culture needs to be accepting and empowering of everyone’s given names. 
Names are sacred, and they should be treated as such. Taking the time and making an effort to learn how other cultures name their children and pronounce their names is not one that American society and American media naturally acknowledges. It requires effort, but it is a necessary undertaking to address this microaggression that many cultural communities decry. 
There is power in a name and speaking it. This is not a phenomenon that applies only to AAPI communities, but it has long since been a rallying point for so many other marginalized groups. 
The power behind speaking a name was emphasized by Kimberle Crenshaw in an effort to seek justice by speaking the names of the women and girls who have been victims of police brutality, whose stories remained buried by the media. The call to “say her name” and now “say their names” is a cry to continue seeking justice for those who have been altogether slighted by the justice system. 
As a member of the AAPI community, I stand in solidarity with the African American community, advocating for individuals like Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Elijah McClain and Ahmaud Arbery, among many others whose names should be spoken.  
The movements to Stop AAPI Hate and to emphasize that Black Lives Matter are not dissimilar in their emphasis that names hold power. Speaking a name becomes an opportunity to bring attention to issues that need to be addressed. 
The great danger of this microaggression lays with the “othering” language of those that deliberately choose to mispronounce, misname and demonstrate a shameless disregard for other cultures. This was the case for those that sought to discredit the platform of the current presidential administration; on the campaign trail of the latest presidential election, former senator David Perdue expressed his genuine indifference for learning how to pronounce Vice President Kamala Harris’ name. This blatant disregard for educating oneself is insensitive to marginalized communities. It can be harmful, too, by exacerbating the same feelings of xenophobia that have contributed to the rise in hate crimes against these groups. 
It is not the same as the barista getting your name wrong at Starbucks; for these marginalized communities, it is a matter of finally being acknowledged and embraced by the world around them. For the privileged, who cannot know the depth of this wound, it is our collective responsibility to acknowledge our past complicity and to do something about it. The resources are out there and in a time when the world is at our fingertips, it simply cannot be too much of an ask.

This weekend No. 1 USC will travel to Bloomington, Ind. to face off against No. 15 Indiana for a two-game set.
Coming off another dominating weekend performance, this time versus San José State, the Trojans are looking to extend their undefeated season against an Indiana team hungry to snap its own six-game losing streak.
While the Hoosiers 8-8 record is not intimidating, their strength of schedule and play at home indicates that this matchup might not be a walk-in-the-park for the Trojans. Between their 6-2 home record and all of their losses this season coming against top eight teams, Indiana is not a team to glance over. The Hoosiers will look to upset USC and record their first win in program history against the Trojans after dropping the 12 previous matchups between the schools.
As they prepare to fly across the country, USC head coach Marko Pintaric touched on what he wants to see from his team as they go up against the Hoosiers.
“I’m looking to see everybody’s input and improvements from last weekend,” Pintaric said. “We also want to put some of our players in different positions just to see how they can adjust to a different team because Indiana is not the same as San José State.”
During such an unpredictable season with many new faces on the roster, the Trojans’ upperclassmen experience has been as big of a factor as any in their remarkable success so far.
“I think our leadership is a big reason why we have been so successful,” Pintaric said. “We have a great group of seniors with our team captains Denise [Mammolito] and Kelsey [McIntosh], Maud [Megens] returning, and basically half our team being upperclassmen. And although they might be playing less minutes, they are still leading in the water.” 
One of those upperclassmen, junior driver Grace Tehaney, has been crucial for USC on the offensive end of the pool. The 2020 Third Team All-American has 20 goals through 10 games this season, with seven of them coming just last weekend. Tehaney noted the team’s impressive 10-0 start can in large part be attributed to how focused the team is on staying in the present.
“Coming off a season that got cut short, we go into each game that we play knowing it can all be taken away from us,” Tehaney said. “So no matter who we are playing or what game it is, we recognize that all that matters is what is going on in the pool at that moment.”
One of the main reasons for the strong season the Trojans have put together is their roster depth; on any given night, there are several players who can step up and make a significant impact on the outcome of the game. The ability to rotate the lineup is why USC has had six different lead goal-scorers in each of their first 10 games thus far. 
Although being “undefeated” has a nice ring to it, coach Pintaric emphasized that the Trojans are focusing on “improving and bettering ourselves as a team so we can reach our ultimate goal of winning a national championship.” The next step in the chase for a title will begin on Friday in Indiana as USC hopes to continue rolling through its competition and show why they are considered the best team in the country.
The Trojans will face the Hoosiers at 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. Friday and Saturday morning, respectively.

LeBron James is 36 years old and has evaded “Father Time” thus far. But every game he plays, every 38-minute night James takes command of his team, feels like it adds another mile onto his odometer. Eventually, the tank that has spurred LeBron on through 18 arduous seasons will run out of gas. “The King” won’t be around the league much longer; his championship window shrinks day by day. LeBron needs to win now.
Storied franchises like the Lakers garner high expectations. There is no room for error when it comes to the front office and basketball operations; you don’t hang 17 championship banners by regularly making errors. However, with the clock ticking down to 12 p.m. and the trade deadline on the horizon, general manager Rob Pelinka made a grave mistake that could come back to haunt his Lakers when the playoffs come around. 
Pelinka refused to include 20-year old guard Talen Horton-Tucker in a trade proposal for Toronto Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry, according to Shams Charania of Stadium.  
From Pelinka’s perspective, this makes some sense. Lowry is 35 years old, and his contract expires after this season. Horton-Tucker, on the other hand, is under team control during his restricted free agency period. 
In order to match salaries, the proposed trade would have likely sent Dennis Schroeder and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope packing along with Horton-Tucker, on a one-way train to Toronto. Because Lowry is a free agent in the upcoming offseason, trading for him at the deadline would have meant he was a possible season rental if he were to decide to sign elsewhere. Losing three rotation players would have decimated the Lakers’ depth for the season while losing what could be a special talent in Horton-Tucker. 
Lowry may be 35, chasing another championship on his last legs, but we know exactly who he is, and who he’ll be in the postseason. When palms start to get sweaty and every possession feels like life or death, Lowry is a proven playoff performer. He put up 26 points and 10 assists against Golden State in Game 6 of the 2019 Finals to put the reigning champs to bed and bring Toronto its first NBA Championship. Just last season in the bubble, Lowry backed down Kemba Walker and hit a fadeaway jumper against the Celtics in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals to ice the game and keep the Raptors’ season alive. 
Lowry is capable of netting double-digit scoring totals in any game while controlling the pace of play with his playmaking ability. We saw how effective Lowry can be next to a superstar like Kawhi Leonard; imagine the six-time All Star running and gunning next to the likes of James and Anthony Davis. Lowry would not be a detriment to the Lakers No. 1 defensive rating in the association either, as the high-IQ veteran would fit right into head coach Frank Vogel’s defensive schemes. 
Horton-Tucker can be a star down the line, but he is still a few years away from being an effective piece in the playoffs. Caldwell-Pope, amid yet another shooting slump, shot 34.1% from three in March. Schroeder has been the Lakers third best player all season, but he reportedly turned down a four-year, 84 million dollar extension offer from the Lakers, showing the two sides are not on the same page. 
During James’ first season with the Lakers in 2018, former general manager Magic Johnson said, “now it is Cleveland all over again, and we don’t want that,” when asked about the Lakers’ handling of James’ workload. Front offices around the league have noted the state of James’ teams after he signs elsewhere. Letting go of multiple future assets to assist James in his quest for a title left both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Miami Heat in the draft lottery the season after James announced his departure. 
Horton-Tucker’s potential to be a legitimate scorer in this league made it difficult for Pelinka to throw him into a deal for a 35-year old Lowry. Through the corner of his eye, Pelinka spotted a quick sneak peak of life after LeBron, and it wasn’t so pretty. 
But when the Lakers signed James to a four-year contract, they threw the youth movement out the window, eventually packaging a plethora of young players for the superstar Anthony Davis. Implicit in the move was the understanding that there is no “life after LeBron”; all that matters is winning as many championships as possible while James wears the purple and gold. Just ask Heat or Cavs fans — those championships are worth it.

Ella Fitzgerald was one of the most popular jazz singers in the United States, winning 13 Grammy awards and selling over 40 million albums with her flexible, wide-ranging and timeless voice. She also faced many challenges throughout her career, from losing her mother and being a teenage runaway, to facing discrimination in the entertainment industry and on tour.
The Ella Fitzgerald Charitable Foundation was created and funded by the “First Lady of Song” herself in 1993, led by her desire to use her successful musical career to help others interested in music from diverse backgrounds. What started as a small private foundation has grown over the years. 
The foundation gave its first scholarship in vocal jazz to the California State University, Long Beach almost 20 years ago. Since then, the foundation has funded scholarships at public universities and community colleges all over the country, including New York, Virginia and North Carolina.
Beginning Fall 2021, the Ella Fitzgerald Charitable Foundation will be partnering with the USC School of Dramatic Arts to offer four-year scholarships to two incoming first-year musical theatre students. The aim of the program is to make education more accessible to marginalized students with financial need.
The musical theatre scholarship for SDA students will be the 30th scholarship that the Ella Fitzgerald Charitable Foundation has endowed, as well as the first scholarship given for a musical theatre program. The scholarship will also be the first that the SDA musical theatre program, which was launched in Fall 2019, will receive. According to executive director Fran Morris-Rosman, the Foundation has provided partial scholarships to students at the USC Thornton School of Music in the past.
“If you think back in music history, the history of jazz is pretty darn color blind,” Morris-Rosman said. “Ella worked with everybody … She worked with musicians from all over the world, who looked like everybody we have on the planet, so we want the musical theatre department to reflect Ella’s world.”
Morris-Rosman said that the Foundation had been looking to include a musical theatre scholarship for about a year, since Fitzgerald had sung many Broadway show tunes during her career. After having enjoyed SDA’s 2012 production of “City of Angels,” as well as great conversations with Kenneth Noel Mitchell, director of musical theatre at USC, Morris-Rosman decided to continue Fitzgerald’s charitable legacy. Fitzgerald had also been awarded the USC Magnum Opus Award in 1992.
According to Sara Fousekis, associate dean of advancement at SDA, the scholarship will be designated to Black and Indigenous people and people of color in accordance with the school’s commitment to training more BIPOC students.
“It’ll allow us to give scholarships to incoming students for generations to come, but it also achieves our goal of making sure that our program is the most diverse program that it can be,” Fousekis said. “These scholarships from a foundation like the Ella Fitzgerald [Charitable Foundation] are so crucial because sometimes it’s the difference between a student being able to make the finances work to come and pursue their dreams in the arts.”
Fousekis also hopes the scholarship will be an incentive to secure the best talent from across the globe and to compete with other reputable programs such as the University of Michigan and New York University.
“I hope it will allow us to be a more accessible program to the widest student [representations] from around the world,” Fousekis said. “I hope it will create a sense of pride for the scholars that are attached to this legend of Ella Fitzgerald, and I hope it will be the beginning of many more scholarships for the musical theatre program.”
According to Mitchell, the student reaction to the Ella Fitzgerald Charitable Foundation Scholarship has been very positive. He hopes it will make students from marginalized communities feel less isolated and more hopeful about their future.
“We hope to change the face of musical theatre,” Mitchell said. “It is a broader range of representation of identities that we see everyday in society, but we don’t see on stage, film, and TV as much as we should — and that is because there are not enough creative opportunities available.”
Mitchell also said that he hopes that the scholarship, as well as Fitzgerald’s story and mark on an industry that is not welcoming to BIPOC individuals, demonstrates the importance of acknowledging the many diverse identities that exist that do not have the opportunity to finance their training.
“I really hope that we diversify our student population and our faculty,” Mitchell said. “I really hope that we will be known as a school that not only welcomes diversity but is excited by it, and allows actors of all different identities to really know they have a place to train, and a place to be seen in the entertainment industry.”

Editor’s Note: In 2018, the Daily Trojan published an article profiling USC students who were involved with the creation of the “Crazy Rich Asians” soundtrack. However, the article did not include Isaac Lucas, who also contributed to the film. We regret Lucas’ erasure and acknowledge this error. 
Producer, musical artist and USC Thornton School of Music alumnus Isaac Lucas — whose stage name is Relaye — grew up with music in his blood and in his ears. Born in Kansas to a mother and father who started a reggae band in the ’80s, Relaye was constantly surrounded by music; he learned how to play the piano from his mother when he was five and listened to reggae, old-school funk and classical music on family car-drives.  
After moving from piano to the trumpet in the fifth grade and then back to the piano, Relaye landed on music production after downloading the Beatmaker app in his senior year of high school. 
“[I was drawn to] just the creativity, being able to do more with multiple instruments versus just honing in on one specific instrument,” Relaye said. “It was just kind of more fun to me, the idea of being able to make anything I wanted.” 
He had pushed away thoughts of pursuing music as a career at that point — his marching band director gave him an ultimatum between the marching band and basketball, and he went with sports — but music production lingered in the back of his mind even as he applied to USC in 2010 as an architecture major. 
Relaye was also in the position to walk on to the USC basketball team, but after collaborating with several suitemates from Thornton on music, he switched to a music business and technology major in the second semester of his freshman year.  
“We would just kind of chop it up and make music together,” Relaye said. “Eventually, they were like, ‘Why aren’t you just in music school?’ Them asking was the first time I genuinely realized or considered, ‘Oh, this is potentially something I can do as a career.’” 
Relaye initially thought that he would stick with orchestral composition, but found himself gravitating towards digital audio production after taking more classes. 
“[The] program at the time was very broad and covered all aspects of the music industry so I think the biggest ‘aha moment’ was probably just realizing which of those classes I gravitated to the most,” Relaye said. “And I really just found myself enjoying classes that involved the creative process.” 
Fellow USC alumna and girlfriend Alya Omar met Relaye in a marketing class — she was an international relations global business major — in 2015. She was at first apprehensive when he told her that he created music. 
“I was like … ‘What if I don’t like his music and I have to pretend to?’” Omar said. “But when I finally heard his song, I was like, ‘Wow, this is truly incredible, so blown away, and I was a fan from the start.’” 
In his junior year, Relaye saw a Craigslist ad from independent record label Blue Élan Records calling for artists to put together a demo album. He submitted his work and was called in for a meeting. 
“I was just thinking it was going to be like, ‘We’re going to let you use our studio to record a song’, and then a conversation later they [said], ‘How would you like a record deal?’” 
He was signed to the label for around four years, releasing an EP titled “9 to 5” in 2017 and the album “Oddity” in 2019. But as the sole hip hop artist signed to the label — which typically releases alternative and indie rock, Americana and folk music — Relaye realized that Blue Élan Records wasn’t able to provide the networks he desired. 
“They have a lot of artists in bluegrass and country and Indie … and it just didn’t end up being the greatest fit in terms of … after I deliver an album, what they’re able to do with it just because their network … [is] all in these different genres,” Relaye said. “So when it came to trying to facilitate the growth and exposure of [hip hop artists], it kind of fell flat in other ways.” 
In 2017, Relaye applied for a position at Math Club, a commercial music and composing venture founded by the Grammy-nominated music production team Cheapshot and Vin Skully, which has created hundreds of songs for movies like “Spiderman: Homecoming,” the “Pitch Perfect” series and “Avengers: Age of Ultron.” 
“I think having been able to develop my music for a couple of years with the label put me in a position where they heard [my music] and they were like, ‘We would love to meet up,’” Relaye said.
He did remote work for the company for a year until they brought him in for a full-time position, where he now creates around a hundred songs per year for the company’s catalog as well as custom music for high profile projects such as “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Shaft.”   
“More often than not, I’m creating full songs from the ground up, so I will self-produce a track, write a song to it, record it, put a rough mix on it where it’s like demo quality and then submit three of those every week,” Relaye said.  
At first, the prospect of securing placements for such high profile movies and TV shows overwhelmed Relaye, especially since his very first placement was for the hit show “Empire.”  
“The first couple of times … it felt more daunting in the sense of ‘If this doesn’t stick, and they don’t like it, it’s going to be awful,’” Relaye said. “But after doing it for so long, you kind of realize … it’s kind of like throwing darts at a dartboard … [you] hope it lands but if it doesn’t, it’s not the end of the world.” 
Relaye’s first custom music project was for “Crazy Rich Asians.” He was flown out to New York with his boss, where he had a studio session with Awkwafina and co-wrote the song for the end title, “Money (That’s What I Want).” 
“That was a super fun experience, she was super cool,” Relaye said. “It kind of went from zero to 100, where it was like, I’m just in the office making songs for the catalog and then, ‘Oh, you’re flying with me to New York tomorrow.’” 
It’s largely Math Club’s signature sound — described as a “hip hop electronic hybrid” –– that appeals to these films and TV shows’ contemporary scores and soundtracks. 
“More often than not, supervisors are looking for music that is along the lines of contemporary, like this sounds like what’s popular on Spotify or top 40 type stuff,” Relaye said. 
Relaye’s personal music, however, diverges from the norm. He himself describes his music as pretty “weird” — he aims to create music that isn’t firmly anchored within hip hop traditions. 
“I try to stand out, or separate myself more,” Relaye said. “I think working at Math Club has kind of funneled me into a happy medium, where before I would just do super left field stuff just for the sake of doing it because I thought it sounded fun … now [my music contains] elements of contemporary sound but is still weird enough to be unique and stand out.” 
Relaye’s song “Lemonade,” featuring Beatnet, is perhaps his most popular personal track. It appeared in an episode of “Shameless,” netting Relaye around 496K Spotify streams and 26,000 YouTube views. 
“It was a featured placement where … that song was the only audio for a decent chunk of time in this episode because it was a scene transition or montage … it gave a lot of people the opportunity to Shazam that song,” Relaye said. “It’s kind of funny because I guess ‘Shameless’ is super popular in Russia, so now I have a lot of Russian fans.” 
“Lemonade” features Relaye’s characteristically clever lyrics and unique production, which Brayden Deskins, a music coordinator and songwriter at Math Club Music, describes as one of the main reasons he is so drawn to Relaye’s work. 
“He’s probably one of my favorite creative minds,” Deskins said. “He is such an incredible lyricist and brings ideas to fruition faster and more efficiently than most of the people I’ve ever met; he’s a genius.” 
Relaye is currently working on an album — his first personal project since he left Blue Élan Records — titled “Green Shoots.” He plans on releasing it this summer. 
“The name ‘Green Shoots’ is supposed to symbolize new growth and new beginnings,” Relaye said. He added later, “It’s a more kind of general [statement] like, ‘This is me as a person.’” 
Several of the songs are ones he made four years ago and never had the opportunity to release or felt were 100% done at the time. Relaye describes himself as a perfectionist when it comes to his music — in fact, when he’s crafting an album, he listens to nothing else but his own tracks. 
“I will write a song, record it or record a demo, listen to it 50 times and mark down what all the things I don’t like or things that I could change or improve or tweak, then record a new version,” Relaye said. “And that process sometimes takes a week, that process sometimes takes four years.” 
Relaye also noted that he aims for his songs to act as a source of escapism for the listener, rather than expounding upon deeply personal topics or hard-hitting social issues. 
“I like to listen to music just for fun; to suspend disbelief, to kind of escape,” Relaye said. “I can listen to a song and be transported to wherever that song is trying to take me.” While he does have personal elements in his music, he added, “My main goal, more often than not, is just creating something that is fun to listen to.”

When the coronavirus pandemic shut the world down in March 2020, movie theaters were, somewhat logically, one of the first places to go. It’s hard to grasp now, in our heightened state of cleanliness and health paranoia, that we used to sit in movie theaters with strangers, in sticky seats, eating popcorn with liquid butter and some sort of cheese powder that came out of a communal shaker.
With the temporary (or permanent) closing of movie theaters nationwide, we lost an entertainment staple. For me, growing up and to this day, going to the movies was an experience. The excitement of filling a purse with snacks, buying a giant slushie and picking the perfect seat is something I didn’t realize I would miss as much as I have.
More importantly, however, the closing of movie theaters engendered a sort of fear within those dreaming of one day working in the film industry, either in front of the camera or behind the scenes. Many of USC’s own School of Cinematic Arts students found themselves nervous about the possibility of dwindling job prospects in the field.
As a result of movie theaters in Los Angeles being closed, I have relied on streaming platforms and microwave popcorn to fill the void. However, it’s nowhere near the same, which is why I found myself texting everyone I know that our movie theaters are reopening.
On March 15, L.A. County officials announced that the county will be moving from the purple tier to the red tier of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s blueprint for reopening. For those of you who have no idea what colors have to do with California’s coronavirus strategy, here’s a SparkNotes version of Newsom’s blueprint: There are four “tiers” of California’s counties — purple, red, orange and yellow — based on the rate of coronavirus spread within each county. L.A. has been in the purple tier (the highest, most widespread risk level) since the blueprint was introduced. However, with the rollout of vaccines in L.A., we’ve officially moved down a tier, which allows more non-essential businesses to reopen their indoor sections.
And that, of course, includes our beloved movie theaters.
Though at limited capacity — the county has mandated 25% capacity within movie theaters — our favorite pastime is being reborn. AMC opened the majority of its L.A. movie theaters on Friday, and the rest of the movie theaters in the county are following suit.
The reopening of L.A.’s movie theaters means more than a place to meet up with friends or eat awful popcorn. For those working in the entertainment field as well as those pursuing careers in movies, the rebirth of movie theaters solidifies the brick-and-mortar film industry, which has been hanging on by a thread during its past year of temporary closure.
The entertainment industry as a whole is impacted by movie theaters’ reopening. Being able to sit in a movie theater with strangers means that, maybe, the spread of the coronavirus is diminishing. While that’s an amazing thing to hear regardless of whether you’re interested in the entertainment industry — I think I can probably speak for most of the world in saying we’re ready for the pandemic to be over — it’s also reassuring for the longevity of the live performance industry. Movie theaters reopening means that, some time in the near future, other in-person events can start opening up, and the industry can start to go back to normal, or, rather, find a new normal.
I encourage you to mask up and head over to your local movie theater. Be safe, of course, and be coronavirus-conscious, but going to the movies is something we can all do to save the film industry from the coronavirus pandemic.

As of April 1, the University is piloting “Tap for Tracing” as a form of contact tracing, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman announced in a University-wide email March 30. Students are able to tap their University ID card when they arrive at one of the five designated locations on campus to ensure they will be notified within 24 hours if someone who was also in that location tested positive for the coronavirus.    
The five locations where “Tap for Tracing” will be offered include Seeds at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, the McCarthy Lawn dining tent, Rosso Oro’s, Seaver Hall located on the Health Science Campus and the transportation tram. 
“We try to categorize them as being-high risk contacts, low-risk contacts, or what we call general notification,” Van Orman said in a media briefing Thursday. “We have that obligation from a legal standpoint, but also from a public health and an ethical standpoint.”
According to Van Orman, the University is working under the guidelines that high-risk exposure entails coming in contact with someone within six feet for over 15 minutes who tested positive. Alternatively, low-risk exposure might mean coming in indirect contact with someone, due to social distancing measures in place, in the vicinity who tested positive. At the current stage, study canopies, slowly reopening libraries and recreational sports offer lower risk, according to Van Orman. 
As campus access continues to increase, the University is making sure that what it offers adheres to safety guidelines and allows for students to socially distance. On-campus libraries have increased to 50% capacity as of April 1. 
According to a Los Angeles Public Health press release Tuesday, Los Angeles County has met the threshold for the state’s orange tier, allowing for less restrictive in-person activities including an increase in indoor capacity. The new county guidelines are set to go into effect Monday. 
Although L.A. County moves to enter the orange tier, USC has yet to announce any new developments with campus reopenings and activities. However, Van Orman said she anticipates additional changes for higher education institutions.
Forty-six students and six employees tested positive for the coronavirus between March 21 and March 27, according to the USC COVID dashboard. The slight increase continues as the result of off-campus transmissions and traveling among the student population, Van Orman said. As cases appear to be plateauing this week, Van Orman encourages students to continue testing — once a week for graduate students and twice a week for undergraduate students — regardless of if they received vaccinations. 
“[Student case transmissions are] part of why we need to be vigilant with our on-campus activities,” Van Orman said. “There’s a potential that people coming to those may be infected so we’re watching our student cases closely.”
As of April 1, individuals over the age of 50 are now eligible for the vaccine and those over the age of 16 will be eligible beginning April 15, California officials announced March 25. 
With vaccines more readily available, Van Orman said she hopes students feel comfortable enough to ask Student Health questions. As the semester comes closer to an end, she recommends students get their vaccine as quickly as possible prior to traveling this summer. 
“I encourage any student who has questions about the safety …  just contact us, do some reading,” Van Orman said. “We want people to start to feel comfortable about it, make sure they have their questions answered and we can really get the word out about the importance of vaccines.”
