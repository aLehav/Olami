Excitement could be felt within every part of Exposition Park as the Los Angeles Rams celebrated their Super Bowl victory with a parade down Figueroa Street, ending in a rally at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Wednesday. The victory is the third professional championship for the city of L.A. since 2020; however, parades for both the L.A. Dodgers and L.A. Lakers did not take place because of coronavirus concerns.
The event prompted major road closures on both Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street near USC, blocking many major entry and exit points to the University. To avoid traffic and ensure access to parking, the Department of Public Safety advised both students and staff to arrive to campus before 8 a.m. in a communitywide email Tuesday. Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Charles Zukoski encouraged professors to accommodate the event, such as by moving classes online during peak hours, in a communitywide message sent the same day.
Campus entry points along Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard, including the south end of Trousdale Parkway and Royal Street entrance on Jefferson Boulevard, were closed to all pedestrian traffic.
George Yi, a freshman majoring in English, recognized the difficulty of getting onto campus Wednesday, primarily for those living off campus.
“Especially if you live on the north side, it’d be really hard for you to cross Jefferson [during the parade],” Yi said. 
Matthew Williams, a graduate student studying geologic science at UC Santa Cruz who also works as a teacher assistant at USC, said trying to enter campus was “impossible” and said he would have liked the University to have provided an earlier warning. 
“I got an email at 5 a.m.,” Williams said. “Just a little bit more notice would have been nice.”
Some professors, however, embraced the parade and took classes online. Mark Shroeder, a professor of philosophy at USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, said he used shutdowns to unite his class for the first time in weeks. 
“Having an excuse to just be online so everybody can see each other and participate equally … I thought that was a good excuse,” Shroeder said.
Students were not immune to disruptions either and some said they had trouble reaching campus, such as Sami Haq, a sophomore majoring in astronautical engineering. 
“It was pretty disruptive in regards to getting on campus because we have to circle all the way around to get in,” Haq said.
The event’s general by students interviewed during the parade was overwhelmingly positive, and many said they enjoyed the atmosphere the festivities brought to campus and the surrounding area. Lindsey Huguet, a sophomore majoring in communications, attended part of the parade without missing her classes. 
“It definitely boosted my spirits on campus, and I think the whole campus environment,” Heughan said. “Just stepping outside and seeing all of the madness and all of the L.A. fans just bringing so much energy to our campus is amazing.”
Kushal Murthy, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he saw value in seeing the players in person enjoying themselves even if you weren’t a follower of the home team. 
“I’m a Colts fan, but I just love football,” Murthy said. “And it was just great seeing the home team win.”
Some students said they felt the celebration merited a day off from their classes. Many who attended the parade with groups of friends enjoyed the atmosphere that having the celebration nearby incited. 
“We’re not really Rams fans, but we’re from L.A.,” said Raymond Lu, a sophomore majoring in environmental science and health. “It was kind of a burden with classes, but we all came and skipped our classes. I think it’s really cool having it right next to campus.” 
“There’s a lot of Angeleno pride for everybody, and it’s really exciting for everyone here. I know the players went to practice at UCLA, but USC is excited because they brought the parade and celebration here.”
The parade at Exposition Park energized the USC community after the Rams had their final week of practice at UCLA, where coach Sean McVay moved practice to avoid heavy wind gusts as the team prepared. 
“There’s a lot of Angeleno pride for everybody, and it’s really exciting for everyone here,” said Krista Nguyen, a sophomore majoring in health and human sciences. “I know the players went to practice at UCLA, but USC is excited because they brought the parade and celebration here.”

Rep. Jamie Raskin from Maryland recounted his experience with the Jan. 6 attack on the United States Capitol in a wide-ranging conversation hosted by Center for the Political Future Co-Director Robert Shrum to promote Raskin’s new memoir, “Unthinkable: Trauma, Truth, and the Trials of American Democracy.” 
The event, held Wednesday night, included discussions about gerrymandering — a process by which political parties manipulate congressional maps for their parties’ gain — reforming the electoral college and the breakdown of bipartisan politics. 
Raskin attributed much of the breakdown to the GOP, calling it the “gerrymander only party”. 
Raskin’s memoir delves into the loss of his son, Tommy, to suicide, the insurrection and the subsequent impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, all of which occurred within a 45-day period. 
As the primary author of Trump’s second impeachment articles, the lead manager of the impeachment and a member of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, Raskin took part in the events following Jan. 6. 
Mere days after his son’s death, Raskin found himself ushered out of the House chamber during the siege. But Raskin said he did not feel afraid in the moment.
“The very worst thing that could ever happen had already happened,” Raskin said. “What were these fascists going to do to me that could be worse than what I’d already experienced?”
Raskin’s talk was a part of the Bully Pulpit speaker series hosted by Shrum and CPF Co-Director Mike Murphy, in which Shrum and Murphy invite Republicans and Democrats to discuss pressing political issues. 
“What we try to do with this programming is expose people to different points of view across the political spectrum and encourage them to be active in public life, or at least as attentive public citizens,” said Shrum in an interview following the event. 
Following discussion about gerrymandering, Raskin also spoke about his role as impeachment manager and how he believed “right up until roll was called” that the Senate would convict Trump. Raskin, who thought former Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell would defect to the Democrats’ side, said he saw McConnell “crying at a number of different points” during the Senate trial. 
“I really thought that the evidence was so overwhelming and so irrefutable and certainly unrefuted at trial that the Republican senators might say to themselves, ‘This is our opportunity to break from this autocratic maniac,’” Raskin said. “And I think that that was probably what was going on inside Mitch McConnell’s heart.”
Fifty-seven senators voted “guilty” in the senate trial — with seven Republican senators joining 50 Democrats — falling short of the 67-33 margin needed for a conviction. 
Cole Dubrow, a sophomore majoring in political science and Spanish, said he was excited for the event and particularly enjoyed the Q&A portion.
​​“It was such a great experience to have someone of that caliber, like a representative in Congress, come and speak to us,” Dubrow said. “I got to ask a question and he answered, which is a really unique opportunity. To feel listened to and heard by representatives is really awesome.”
Raskin’s proximity to the Capitol attacks, which have had heavy implications for the future of democracy, especially interested event attendee Tawfiq Othman, a freshman majoring in architecture. 
“I find it really interesting that he’s able to give insight, since he was kind of at the center of it, the historic events,” Othman said.

From the bubonic plague to the Spanish flu to the coronavirus, Henry Putnam University professor of History and Public Affairs at Princeton University Keith Wailoo presented a lecture about what pandemics throughout history have revealed about society and its racial and class disparities Wednesday. 
USC Visions and Voices invited Wailoo to speak as part of Race, Justice and Medicine in the 21st Century, a lecture series that welcomes three acclaimed scholars of race, gender and medicine to speak on some of the most challenging issues that affect the health of individuals and society. In the hybrid event — where students attended on Zoom or in the Mayer Auditorium at the Health Sciences Campus — –Wailoo spoke and shared slides from Princeton University. 
Currently serving as President of the American Association for the History of Medicine, Wailoo started his academic career teaching social and cultural aspects of health and science at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, where he focused on current issues in healthcare and medical education, and used an understanding of history to inform contemporary practices. Wailoo’s research includes history and health policies and the politics of race and health, covering topics such as gun and drug policies.
“We knew of his work as a historian, and we thought, particularly at this moment in history, in the middle of the COVID pandemic, that his work in studying other pandemics and what they reveal about American society would help show us the unequal burden of COVID-19 for people of color in this country,” said Dr. Pamela Schaff, Director of Keck School of Medicine’s Humanities, Ethics/Economics, Arts and the Law program, in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
On behalf of the Vision and Voices team, Marie-Reine Velez started the event by acknowledging USC’s location on Indigeneous land and honoring the histories of original inhabitants the Tongva, Chumash and Keach peoples and of the African diaspora. 
Wailoo’s presentation first focused on stories about inequality in two major coronavirus pandemic waves. He shared a chart from the New York Times that showed that, in November 2020, during what Wailoo called the pandemic’s first wave, infections in the United States surpassed 11 million and the Black and Latinx community represented a disproportionate number of cases, infections and mortalities. Inequalities worsened as unemployment soared while those who could afford it retreated to “smaller, more secure worlds.” The pandemic’s second wave presented vaccine distribution disparities. 
“New disparities along the lines of vaccine uptake, race and class region, accentuated by political partisanship, drove new realities in infection levels, as well as in the death rate,” Wailoo said. 
Wailoo discussed the issues that pandemics often highlight. The coronavirus raised questions about theories of disease such as asymptomatic transmission, and virus evolution and transmission. It also sparked debates around proper prevention tactics, the government’s role and a strong public health system. Conversations also arose about the sociology of vulnerability and blame as well as the power of both information and disinformation, Wailoo said. 
Wailoo then compared the experiences of the coronavirus pandemic to those of previous pandemics. His slides, which contained various visuals of historical documents such as drawings and book photos, ran through a list of patterns in the responses to and the societal effects of pandemics such as the cholera pandemic in the 19th century and the influenza pandemic in the 20th century.  
Using writer Daniel Defoe’s characterization of the 17th century bubonic plague in London, when the outer parishes that housed the poor were heavily stricken, Wailoo explained that pandemics often reveal the face of poverty. The same pattern could be found in the cholera and yellow fever pandemics. The extensive public suffering during previous pandemics became drivers for change, Wailoo said. 
“One of the things that you can often see is the way in which the public suffering that was witnessed through these graphic examples of people afflicted in the populous central portions of the city can become a rallying cry for quarantine, for aggressive public health measures, street cleaning, closing the boards and also all manner of street cleaning and public health,” Wailoo said.
The pandemics have often expanded government reach, which people have met with protests, Wailoo said. He provided a recent example from Canada, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked emergency powers in response to truckers’ protests against vaccine mandates.
Wailoo also spoke about how blame functions during pandemic — and the rich literature that discusses it — as well as racist, fear-mongering language often used. 
Following Wailoo’s presentation, students asked questions, either through the Zoom Q&A or, if they were participating in-person, through a microphone in the front of the auditorium.
Event organizer and Alexander Capron closed the event by asking attendees to consider carrying the experience and lessons of the pandemic and event forward. 
“Will that shock of each stamp of death from this and illness cause us to build up our public health system?” said Capron, USC professor of law and medicine. “Or will the fact that the burden was borne mostly by the disadvantaged make us shrug it off?”

K-pop boy group TREASURE returned Feb. 15 with its first mini-album, “THE SECOND STEP: CHAPTER ONE.” The album’s four tracks reflect the group’s range and expand upon last year’s “THE FIRST STEP” series.  
Formed through a 2018 survival show, TREASURE debuted under YG Entertainment in 2020. The 12-member group — composed of Choi Hyunsuk, Jihoon, Yoshi, Junkyu, Mashiho, Yoon Jaehyuk, Asahi, Bang Yedam, Doyoung, Haruto, Park Jeongwoo and So Junghwan — is the company’s latest investment following acts such as BLACKPINK, iKON and BIGBANG. Yet, despite their predecessors leaving large shoes to fill, TREASURE consistently meets and exceeds the expectations set by those before them — this album sold more than 167,000 copies on its first day of release, contributing to its over 1 million albums sold since its debut. 
The album comes after a 13-month long period of musical inactivity — a questionable move on YG Entertainment’s end given TREASURE’s career is still in its early stages — but was definitely worth the wait. While each of its past releases explored a different sound, ranging from hints of electronic dance music in “BOY” to the uplifting pop melody of “MY TREASURE,” the group seems to have found the right fit in its latest title track, “JIKJIN.” 
The group sings about the love it has for its partners, utilizing a street racing concept to illustrate the urgency with which it must go toward them: “Go straight to you, I’m crazy in love / Everyone else, get out of my way” and “Add fuel to my emotions / Double for my heart engine, go, vroom.” 
This concept is further illustrated in the song’s composition, with heavy bass and an addictive beat that make the listener feel as if they, too, are speeding down a race track. The song’s prechorus provides a necessary breather, giving main vocalists Bang Yedam, Park Jeongwoo and Junkyu their time to shine in the otherwise intense track. Additionally, TREASURE never fails to include a postbridge dance break in each of their title tracks — for “JIKJIN,” the powerful instrumental blended with the group’s chanting-like singing and synchronized dance moves, was the perfect way to end the song. 
The remaining three tracks — “U,” “DARARI” and “IT’S OKAY” — take a noticeably lighter approach. Initially used as background music in the album’s promotional concept films, “U” never fails to make the listener feel like they’re floating. Perhaps it was the pairing of the track’s invigorating instrumental with imagery of hot air balloons, sunny days and the group members decked out in all-white outfits that makes it the perfect chill summer song (despite its release in February). The song starts off slowly with Bang Yedam’s sweet voice, singing “The moment I saw you, my life stopped because my heart kept wanting only you.” The song later picks up speed until its climax at the chorus, where rapper Choi Hyunsuk proclaims, “I want you,” followed by a fitting combination of refreshing falsettos and a funky beat. Haruto’s flowing rap stands out effortlessly on this track, rapping “You’re always next to me in my drama / It feels like spring has come to me / Your floral scent pass by / So sweet. Spread your wings,” alluding to the lyrics’ theme following a movie-like relationship. Additionally, the song’s bridge is one of TREASURE’s best, with a dynamic background beat juxtaposed with smooth vocals that marks a clear, necessary shift in the easygoing song. 
“DARARI” is another calming track, where TREASURE sings to a lover who serves as its muse. While rappers Choi Hyunsuk, Yoshi and Haruto have participated in the writing and composing of a majority of TREASURE’s discography, “DARARI” was the first track in which Bang Yedam contributed, sparking excitement and anticipation among fans worldwide. Described by Choi Hyunsuk and Yoshi as similar to “warm coffee in the morning,” the song’s light instrumental, steady beat and lilting vocals work together to make the song fresh and soothing.
Similarly, “IT’S OKAY” is another heartwarming track that allows TREASURE to showcase its vocals in a slower ballad. The group reassures the listener that despite hard circumstances, everything will work out in the end, singing “Don’t ever forget me if I’m with you / Even the pain that cannot be expressed in words, it’ll be okay.” The acoustic instrumental is comforting in itself, but coupled with the group’s sweet vocals and genuine lyrics, “IT’S OKAY” demonstrates a different facet of TREASURE’s range — it’s one that it nails regardless. 
It’s clear with this release that TREASURE is a force to be reckoned with as it drives through the K-pop industry, with the obvious diversity of performances it can execute and the caliber to which it does.

It’s reaching the point in the semester where every class feels longer and longer, just like the items on your to-do list. The best way to beat burnout is to change your study scenery, and there’s no better place than coffee shops. 
It’s also possible you’re reaching the point in the semester that the sight of a Dulce latte makes you groan, but a caffeine boost is necessary to get your bones moving as you walk down Trousdale to your next class. If you’re in dire need of some new coffee spots around campus, check out this list:
Nature’s Brew
Although a bit of a trek from campus, Nature’s Brew is a gem located just north on Hoover Street. In this industrial yet cozy spot, you’ll find eccentric art pieces lining the walls and some of the best curated playlists guaranteed to beat boredom while you study. Tables are hard to come by on the weekends, but there is an excellent and extensive variety of iced coffees, smoothies and a kitchen serving up breakfast sandwiches, bagels, pastries and salads in addition to gluten-free and vegan options. If you’re looking for some order inspiration, try its lavender latte, matcha mania smoothie or egg sandwich.
Ministry of Coffee
Located adjacent to USC Village, hidden in the USC Caruso Catholic Center, Ministry of Coffee offers a hip study atmosphere. With plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, this Australian coffee shop is sure to brighten up any essay you have to grind out with its funky decor featuring magazine collages. Whether you need to stop in for a quick pick-me-up or are planning on staying for a while, check out its turmeric latte or fresh juices and smoothies. If you are looking for delicious food, indulge in pastries such as the mouthwatering gluten-free banana bread, one of its decadent toasties or the smashed avocado plate, which allows customers to DIY its avocado toast. 
Bird’s Nest Cafe
A popular spot for breakfast near Ralph’s and La Barca, Bird’s Nest Cafe is a fun, bright spot for those of you looking for a livelier study environment. Arguably featuring some of the best food on this list, Bird’s Nest Cafe has sublime breakfast and lunch options, serving everything from tasty breakfast burritos to flavorful french toast to a great turkey BLT sandwich. To quench your thirst, consider ordering one of its lattes, blended coffee drinks or smoothies. You can also enjoy the vibrant, floral murals featured on the exterior of this community magnet.
DRNK coffee + tea
DRNK coffee + tea features some of the highest quality beans from around the globe to brew fresh coffee for the enjoyment of its customers. Tucked under Element housing, this coffee shop offers a spacious environment, perfectly conducive to fostering productivity. Whatever food or drink item you’re in the mood for, DRNK will not disappoint. Look into its drip coffee or orange ginger latte for an energy bump. If you’re interested in a fun option, order its pink matcha or S’Blendid drinks in flavors such as mocha or chai. Finally, to quell your grumbling stomach, order one of its paninis or, for a vegetarian option, ask for the vegetarian egg wrap.
Philz Coffee
For the more adventurous souls — or ones with cars — check out Philz Coffee downtown. Although located right in the heart of the metropolitan area of Los Angeles, Philz offers a caffeinated safe haven with heart-warming drinks and sweet treats and a mission of fostering a community of coffee lovers. If you need background noise to feel productive, this is the perfect spot to do work and people watch downtown L.A. If it’s your first time, indulge in the cult-classic Mint Mojito or Philharmonic, sweet and creamy, of course, which is Philz’s measurements for ensuring the perfect drink. However, if you don’t want to shake from over caffeination, there are excellent decaf options.

Ever since I became a K-pop fan during my junior year of high school, the genre has always been something I’ve consumed remotely. Given the thousands of miles and hefty time difference separating me from my idols in Seoul, the only possible way for me to support them has been through listening to their music, watching their appearances on variety and reality shows and talking to other fans about them, with the only opportunity in which I can ever engage with them in person being their rare world tours every few years. 
So when the pandemic hit, the shift the K-pop industry underwent really wasn’t a large one for me. Throughout the pandemic, as I adjusted to a new reality of Zoom classes, a work-from-home lifestyle and socializing via FaceTime rather than face-to-face, the K-pop industry was forced to adapt as well. Despite no such slowdown in album releases, magazine photoshoots and variety show appearances, the typical ways in which K-pop groups engaged with their fan bases shifted drastically to adapt to a virtual environment. 
This shift was welcome for me and many other international fans, as K-pop groups created opportunities for us to interact with our idols in ways that simply didn’t exist before. The creation of livestreaming platform Beyond LIVE, which live broadcasts pay-per-view K-pop concerts and fan meetings globally, brought in-person performances to audiences worldwide. The growing prevalence of online fansign events, which consist of opportunities for fans to enter raffles to participate in video calls with their idols and meant to emulate traditional face-to-face opportunities for fans to meet their idols in person, made talking directly to idols a new reality for fans abroad. 
It’s fair to say that these opportunities allowed K-pop companies to — despite the pause that the pandemic put on real life in almost every other aspect — continue profiting off the work of their idols. When Beyond LIVE first launched in April 2020 with SuperM’s virtual concert, more than 75,000 paid viewers tuned in, earning SM Entertainment over $2 million in virtual ticket sales. Additionally, the transition of fansign events to a virtual platform allowed fans even outside of South Korea to also enter raffles, boosting album sales to new heights. 
Yet, most importantly, virtual fan engagement opportunities allowed for K-pop companies to continue capitalizing on their idols in a safe way, encouraging social distancing and pushing the message — through their idols — that we’d be able to meet in person again when it was safe to do so. 
This begs the question of why, as we come up on the two-year mark since the beginning of a pandemic that is clearly nowhere close to being over, the entirety of the K-pop industry appears to be shifting back toward their prepandemic fan engagement methods. Numerous K-pop groups, including TWICE, Stray Kids and ENHYPEN, have begun holding domestic in-person concerts, fan meetings and fansign events again. Despite mask mandates, testing requirements and other coronavirus-related changes to event policies, the need for K-pop companies to capitalize off in-person events is not only selfish and unnecessary but also extremely dangerous, given the ever-changing circumstances of the pandemic. 
This concept becomes even more risky given the industry’s global prevalence and “need” to market abroad, resulting in K-pop groups traveling to the United States for cross-country concert tours — moves I’d assume are fueled by America’s lack of a government-mandated quarantine requirement that allows for multiple concert dates in a relatively short amount of time. Following BTS’ sold-out Permission to Dance On Stage concert at Inglewood’s SoFi Stadium last November, a number of other K-pop groups quickly followed suit, booking venues and announcing American tours, despite rising case numbers due to the omicron variant both in the U.S. and South Korea. 
As a fan, I definitely get it — I’ve missed my K-pop boys just as much as the next fan and would jump at the opportunity to see them in person as soon as physically possible. In fact, I too went to BTS’ concert in November and had the time of my life there. Yet, a part of me can’t help but question the public health implications behind these concerts happening again so quickly. 
The problem itself is twofold: With companies sending their idols abroad for these American concerts, they not only risk the health of their idols — for example, VERIVERY’s Yongseung tested positive for coronavirus in the middle of its U.S. tour last December, resulting in the cancelation of their remaining concert dates — but also the health of their idols’ fans. Because of how rarely an international fan’s favorite idol visits their city, it becomes easy to justify attending their concert despite feeling even the tiniest bit under the weather. Additionally, with the limited stops most of these tours have, it’s not uncommon for fans from surrounding towns, cities and states to travel unnecessarily to attend these shows, promoting even more coronavirus spread. This presents countless risks to public health, risks that are unneeded and all clearly preventable. 
While it’s certainly up to the individual if they’d like to take the risk of contracting coronavirus at an in-person K-pop event, companies should be held accountable for the reckless behavior they’re promoting by sending their idols abroad on these tours in the first place. If these companies still made millions of dollars through coronavirus-compliant virtual events in South Korea, what’s the harm in continuing to do so until the risk of performing abroad decreases as well? 
To these K-pop companies, I just have one question: What exactly is the harm in protecting the idols and fans that are making you all this money in the first place?

Everyone has a “favorite” thing to do — a hobby or activity which may just as well be their passion in life. 
For Hailey Wild, she has followed the path of her favorite thing to do, releasing and performing her music as a singer-songwriter for as long as she can remember. Now, Wild’s passion led to her most recent project, single and music video “My Favorite Part.”
Growing up, Wild, a sophomore majoring in popular performance with a songwriting emphasis, was inspired vocally by the sound of favorite artists such as Adele, Lady Gaga and Amy Winehouse and production-wise by artists such as The Weeknd. Although initially coming from a nonmusical background, Wild found music from someone who came to define Hailey’s musical interest for the rest of her life.
“My grandma played the piano,” Wild said. “She had a grand piano at her house that’s been in our family since the early 1900s, so I remember playing that. My grandma was driving me one day in the car, and she heard me singing along to an opera that she was playing.” 
From there, Wild’s grandparents enrolled her in classical lessons, where Wild first got her start at singing. But it was not until high school where she honed in on the seeds of her talent.
While in high school, Wild performed in the choir, participated in talent shows playing the piano while singing and collaborated on music with whoever she could find. During her senior year, at only 17 years old, Wild released her first single, “Long Time.” It was also in high school, like for most teenagers her age, when she decided what she wanted to do in life. 
“I was having three or four gigs over the summer and then one or two, every weekend during the school year,” Wild said. “I always knew I wanted to do something with music, but that’s when I was kind of like, ‘OK, this is … the one thing.’”
Recently transferring to the Thornton School of Music, Wild is continually engaged with her studies and inspired by her peers.
“From this semester, I feel like I’ve gotten way more confident just performing on stage,” Wild said. “I wanted to go somewhere that was gonna give me the tools to help me more with my writing and write with meaning. Every day [that] I’m here, I’m loving music even more because I’m learning something new.” 
Wild planned to release a full album in 2020. However, plans changed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
“At the time, we all thought, it’ll probably be like a few months,” Wild said. “I was … gonna use all this extra time to be super productive, and I just burnt myself out. It was not sustainable, especially when I had been performing so much before. And I realized that’s where a lot of my joy comes from with music.” 
However, Wild did not let the pandemic stop her from doing what she loved, and her newest single was born by the end of spring 2020. Drawing from personal experience for “My Favorite Part,” Wild was inspired by the feelings one experiences when engaged in the typical romance.
“When you’re falling in love with somebody, and [you] get to that point where you’re falling in love and you don’t feel like you’re ready for that emotional, like, intensity. You can’t help having human emotions. That’s where the sentiment of the song came from,” Wild said.
On this project, Wild collaborated on various occasions with her peers — production aspects with California based music producer Pharaoh 101 and her music video with Film and Television Production majors in the School of Cinematic Arts, namely Melanie An, Mirjam Maier and Eric Yeich.
“We were all in the same production class last semester and had done a documentary with Hailey as one of the subjects,” An said. “So afterward, she approached us about wanting to do a music video, and we were all super interested.”
With An in charge of cinematography, Maier headed production design and Yeich co-directed with Wild. Per their positions for the documentary that brought them all together, Wild’s vision for the video quickly became reality.
“The music video is definitely more polished than other things I did before,” Wild said. “Not that those weren’t valuable experiences or good videos … I just know more now what I’m doing [and] how to do better. The rest of the team helped me with the actual cuts, shots and locations. And because I had just a very basic idea, they really brought it together.”
The collaboration went smoothly between the four, largely due to their past experience working with Wild.
“We saw things similarly a lot,” Yeich said. “She seemed like a person who I could get along with. [And] she’s passionate about her career, which I respect.”
During the actual shoot, Wild came in with a creative drive, as well as unmistakable empathy for her fellow students that her team took note of.
“[Hailey] had a very clear vision of the set as well,” Maier said. “We’re all students busy with our majors, so she was very patient and we always just work things out with the flow. It was never any sort of intense pressure.”
Following the release of “My Favorite Part,” along with its video, Wild is more than ready to return to performing live, especially if coronavirus restrictions continue to die down. 
“​​I honestly haven’t gotten to perform a lot yet in L.A. I’m hoping this semester to do that,” Wild said. “I performed all the time in San Diego. But it’s definitely a different scene … so I know it’ll just take some time to start getting up here.”
In the meantime, Wild finds time apart from her music to enjoy her favorite parts of college life.
“Honestly. I like to be pretty physically active, especially in school,” Wild said. “I like to work out … just to not be super stressed. I love food… It doesn’t all revolve around music, you know? I like watching YouTube.”
Wild’s newest single, “My Favorite Part,” releases on Spotify Feb. 21, its music video will drop March 4.
Editor’s note: Eric Yeich currently serves on the Daily Trojan masthead as video editor.
Correction: In a previous version of this article, we incorrectly described the writing process of “My Favorite Part” as taking place at USC Thornton School of Music. Wild wrote the song in 2020, before transferring to Thornton. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

A lot of the time being a fan of the United States Men’s National Team makes you feel like a cartoon character with an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other. The angel feeds you positive vibes telling you to look on the bright side, to celebrate victories and shrug off defeats. When you’re thinking like the angel, you accept that the USMNT isn’t perfect, and that’s OK (the healthy, rational way of thinking). 
The devil is the pessimist, giving into the pure frustration of bad results and the reactionary thinking that comes with them. When the devil’s in charge, you want every player benched and every coach fired, screaming at your TV as if any of the people on the field can hear you (I still haven’t got the memo yet). 
To love the USMNT is a polarizing affair, and it’s only expounded in times such as these. The United States has just three games left in its qualifying campaign: away at Mexico, home against Panama and away at Costa Rica. The USMNT stands in second place in the Octagon, and the three teams it’s about to play are below it, ready to pounce at any mistake and claim a spot in the 2022 World Cup. 
Both my angel and devil are engaged in a heated debate in my head, and I can’t decide whether to be more excited or afraid. Today, I’m giving the inside scoop on what my personal voices are telling me ahead of the final window of qualifying, and in doing so, maybe make a little more sense of the madness.
The angel says the U.S. controls its destiny
This team worked its tail off to get to this point. If you take a step back, being second place heading into the final window of games is absolutely acceptable, especially since the gap between the U.S. and fifth-place Costa Rica is 5 points. 
It’s easy to get caught up in all of the calculations — how many points each team needs, what results need to happen for the U.S. to definitively qualify for the World Cup — but it really comes down to just winning one of the final three. Gaining 3 points against any of the three teams gives the U.S. enough of a cushion to afford dropping the other two games. Let all the other chips fall where they may. 
The bar is so low. Sure, these teams are some of the best competition in the group, but 3 points from 9 possible is not in any way an unreasonable ask. This U.S. team is too talented to fail like in 2017. 
Manager Gregg Berhalter has the chance to prove himself once and for all and establish a good rapport with the USMNT faithful ahead of the World Cup. His team selection and tactical blunders have to end somewhere, right? He can learn from both his mistakes and successes. After all, his team won the reverse fixtures against Mexico and Costa Rica. There’s a clear instruction manual on beating the teams in front of them: Limit the defensive errors, get the ball to your creative outlets, take advantage of set pieces and secure a one-way ticket to Qatar. 
The devil says the U.S. is going to blow it 
The perfect storm is upon us. Brace for impact. It happened last time, and it’s going to happen again. 
Remember when the U.S. failed to qualify in 2017? How could you forget that dreadful night, the 2-1 loss in Trinidad and Tobago? What’s stopping that from happening again? The U.S. really needs at least 5 points to ensure they don’t slip out of the top four. That’s a tall task. 
This qualifying window is undoubtedly the most difficult the U.S. will encounter, with the biggest stakes. The team has never won at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico in a World Cup qualifier. Never. Not once. That’s an automatic loss, no room for discussion. Panama was the first team to defeat the U.S. this qualifying cycle, and frankly, it wasn’t a fluke. The U.S. looked outclassed and outworked in that fixture, and the team hasn’t shown enough between then and now to assure fans that the same result won’t happen again. The last time the U.S. traveled to Costa Rica, they were sent home with a 4-0 thrashing. Enough said. 
Berhalter looks clueless, and he’s been carried this far by his talent pool. His tactical unraveling against Canada proves what we always feared to be true: The second things get tough, the U.S. folds. His team has no response when the opposition sits back in a low block; how can you expect them to get a goal when they need it? 
Back to reality
With all of this said, it’s never this black and white, even if it may feel like it is. There’s no telling what will happen from here, but one thing is for certain — the end is in sight. The grueling suspense of the World Cup Qualifying cycle is about to reach a merciful conclusion. Until then, I’m stuck with the angel and devil duking it out in my head, riding the fence between optimism and pessimism. Stuck in limbo, all we can do is wait.

With NBA franchises beginning or continuing strides after the trade deadline last Thursdays, players and teams alike look towards the playoffs as they nearly enter the home stretch of the NBA season. Former Trojans have either continued their impressive form or contributed crucial performances off the bench in hopes of creating team momentum as some push for the playoffs and the play-in tournament. 
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
With the Chicago Bulls still suffering from the absence of starting guards Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso, as well as guard Zach Lavine’s fluctuating injury report, the Windy City has had to rely on former Trojan DeMar DeRozan. Five-time All-Star and NBA Most Valuable Player candidate DeRozan has taken his game to the next level, propelling the Bulls to a four-game winning streak after their narrow loss to the Phoenix Suns last Monday.
In the last five games, DeRozan has averaged 37.4 points, 5 rebounds, 5.2 assists and nearly a steal on 61% shooting from the field and 42% from beyond the arc. His streak of six-straight games with at least 35 points and 50% shooting tied NBA legend Wilt Chamberlain’s streak.
The Bulls sit as the second seed in the Eastern Conference with a 37-21 record and boast the second-longest active win streak only behind the Boston Celtics who have witnessed a resurgence in their nine consecutive victories. DeRozan’s performances make the Bulls a promising unit once the team returns to full health. 
Guard Kevin Porter Jr., Houston Rockets
As the Houston Rockets have entered an informal rebuild following James Harden’s departure, the team has embraced youth and talent. Kevin Porter Jr. has recently impressed in his role as a combo guard, with the third-year seasoned player combining his playmaking ability along with his versatile scoring. 
In the last three games, Porter Jr. has averaged nearly 22 points, 7 assists and 3 rebounds on 54% shooting from the field and 58% beyond the arc. Notably, Porter Jr. posted 30 in Houston’s loss against the Toronto Raptors last Thursday, as he shot 11-16 from the field and 6 3-pointers on 9 attempts. 
Alongside Porter Jr., Rookie of the Year candidate Jalen Green has pitched in promising performances in his first year with the Rockets, and the duo look to continue growing and return Houston to prominence in the near future. 
Power Forward/Center Chimezie Metu, Sacramento Kings
Following a six-player blockbuster trade that sent the Kings’ Tyrese Halliburton and Buddy Hield to the Indiana Pacers for star center Domantas Sabonis and others, the Kings have tried to acclimate their new roster. 
Despite the changes made throughout the team, Chimezie Metu has contributed efficiently off the bench in limited minutes. In the last four games, he has quietly averaged 11 points and 6 rebounds on 65% shooting from the field. 
Metu’s contributions off the bench will help the Kings make their late push for a spot in the play-in tournament and provide Sac-Town a chance to taste playoff action after 15 years. 
Center Dewayne Dedmon, Miami Heat
Miami currently sits first in the Eastern Conference with a 37-21 record and owe much credit to their depth. Dewayne Dedmon has pitched in efficient stats and numbers in limited minutes. In his last three games, Dewayne Dedmon has averaged 10 points and 5 rebounds with only 15 minutes per game. 
Dedmon has offered Miami versatility and floor spacing off the bench as he is currently averaging 51% shooting from beyond the arc in limited attempts. If Miami looks to return to the NBA finals and complete their objective, depth from utility players like Dedmon will prove critical.

Women’s water polo’s chance at a perfect season is over. No. 3 USC slipped up against No. 1 UCLA, 11-10, at the Triton Invitational last weekend, but there’s no time to dwell on it. The Trojans host No. 2 UC Berkeley this Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
After an 11-0 start, Cal comes into the first MPSF match of the season fresh off a bye week, while USC returns home after a four-game tourney in San Diego. The Bears are battle tested; every game this season, they’ve played a team in the top 15 rankings, and their offense has produced double-digit goals in all but one outing.
“Cal is a very good team, well-balanced at each position,” Head Coach Marko Pintaric said. “They’re going to be very physical and tough to play.”
The USC offense is also humming. The Trojans tallied 10 scores on even strength against the Bruins, led by a hat trick from redshirt sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns. But Pintaric was disappointed in the 11 conceded goals, a far cry from the team’s goal of holding teams under 6.
Handling Cal’s high-powered, consistent attack will be a tall task, literally. Seniors attacker Emma Wright and center Kitty Lynn Joustra stand at 6 feet and 5-foot-11, respectively. The Canadian Olympian and the three-time All-American have combined for 41 goals so far, and the Bears aren’t just a two-headed beast; three other players have notched over double digits as well.
Senior utility Bayley Weber, the MPSF Player of the Week, and the rest of the Trojan defense will have its hands full Saturday.
“It’s more of a mentality that we need to focus on, rather than physical defense,” junior goalie Carolyne Stern said. “We need to focus on taking pride in our defense. But as a collective, I think that we’re getting better … I’m excited to see what this weekend and the next couple weekends bring.”
Stern, who appears to have won the starting job in the cage, is coming off of a tough game against UCLA, only saving 7 of 18 shots that came her way. Despite this rocky patch for the USC defense, Pintaric knows that it’s all about communication, something that the team is figuring out as they continue to gel together.
“This is a young team in terms of playing together, but I know the team is very confident and working very hard,” Pintaric said. “And when you work that hard, I think the confidence follows, and I have a feeling that the team feels the same.”
While this Cal matchup is an important early season test — the Trojans’ early success will look a lot different if they drop back-to-back games to the Bruins and the Bears — Pintaric is approaching it as any other game.
“Cal and UCLA are undefeated right now,” Pintaric said. “[The players] will take the exact same preparation if [we] would play Stanford one loss or with ASU with four losses or any other teams.”
The Trojans hop into the pool this Saturday at 1 p.m. to face UC Berkeley.

USC hosts nearly 21,000 undergraduate students and two gyms. Although the school claims that “if a student is registered for a minimum of 1 unit, they will receive access to the gym as a part of tuition,” it’s only fair to address the fact that the word “access” does a lot of heavy lifting. Trying to book a reservation at one of the two gyms is a workout in itself.
For those unfamiliar, USC uses a booking portal for its students to reserve specific time slots. However, there are only 100 spots available per slot, and the times vary from an hour and 15 minutes to two hours. Additionally, the earliest you can reserve a spot is two days in advance.
The most prevalent issue that comes with such a system is the rapidness with which slots are reserved. If a time is not secured within an hour (sometimes even 10 to 15 minutes) or so after becoming available, then it’ll likely be gone by the time you check the portal. Some people have even resorted to setting timers on their phone for the moment the slots open or continuously refreshing the site in the hopes that someone drops their reservation right before going. 
It’s honestly confusing as to how the University could think two gyms would be enough to capacitize the number of students at USC. On any given weekday, USC Village Fitness Center offers around 11 time slots, while the Lyon Center offers around 14. That means that each day, there are theoretically enough slots for 2,500 students.
Although 2,500 available slots in a given day may seem like enough, it also has to be brought to attention that the gyms are available for all staff, faculty and students — undergraduate and graduate. That means a total of almost 50,000 students, 4,700 full-time faculty and 16,614 staff. That’s 2,500 slots available for 57,000 people — enough to cover just over 4% of the people the University claims the gyms are open to. 
Of course, it’s safe to assume that not everyone intends on going to the gym every day, or that those students, staff and faculty from around the area might be able to attend other locations. However, even if that 57,000 was to be halved, only about 8% of individuals can claim a spot.
The biggest issue with not having dependable access to the gym isn’t necessarily missing out on gains or the specific equipment but the routine and structure that working out provides for so many students. Dozens of studies conducted show the benefits of exercise, specifically for college students.
While the pandemic is the primary reason for this reservation system, this system and two gyms simply is not enough for the USC population. 
Exercise has been proven to heighten focus, elevate mood and lower stress, increase energy and sharpen memory — all assets for a successful college career. The Better Health Channel states that “people who exercise regularly have better mental health and emotional wellbeing, and lower rates of mental illness.” An article from the Journal of the American Medical Association states that multiple trials have proven that “exercise was associated with reduced depression symptoms when compared with no treatment and placebo and active control groups” and that exercise has undeniably similar effects on mental health to antidepressants and psychotherapy.
There’s a great irony in the fact that USC has been emphasizing mental health awareness in recent weeks, even though there’s been absolutely no movement to modify an important resource in mental health aid.
There is an obvious solution to this problem: just open another gym. However, the intricacies of planning, building and paying for another recreation center is a process that’s impossible for most people to understand. On the other hand, if the school really wants to flaunt its money as it’s been doing this past year in a way that would directly benefit the Trojan community, then opening another gym might just be the solution worth pushing for.
Clarification: This article was updated to reflect that the earliest USC gym reservations can be made is 48 hours in advance, not that you “can only reserve a slot exactly two days in advance.”

I’ve barely watched the Winter Olympics, but I have to hand it to the athletes — it seems like they’ve thoroughly mastered the art of slipping and sliding across icy surfaces with varying degrees of steepness. But this year’s event is making headlines for a different reason: Beijing is the first winter Olympics to rely entirely on artificial snow. 
Beijing was no winter wonderland to begin with. Despite cold temperatures, it has an average February snowfall of less than an inch. However, perhaps you’ve seen footage of the dystopian setup of the Big Air ski jump, a pristine icy slope reminiscent of a Hot Wheels track, shrouded by the decrepit gray cooling towers of an industrial park or photos of the dusty brown hills encasing snowy ski slopes in nearby Zhangjiakou and Yanqing. As improbable as it may seem, Olympic officials have created patches of winter in Beijing. 
While many athletes have accepted the conditions for what they are, the artificial snow — albeit somewhat icier than its natural counterpart — comes at a huge cost. China estimates that around 49 million gallons of water will be used to fabricate snow for the Games, and experts think it could actually be up to 10 times that amount. Water is being diverted from reservoirs and siphoned from irrigation systems to meet the demand — a significant worry for a city with preexisting water scarcity issues. It’s also worth mentioning, constructing artificial ski runs in the naturally arid hills can also cause soil erosion and degrade natural vegetation.
This snow deficit is nothing new but should serve as a warning proxy for the consequence of our ever-rising emissions. While past winter Games have been reinforced with artificial snow, the continued warming of the climate will result in a dwindling number of qualified host cities. In fact, one study found that by 2100, only a city in northern Japan would have the necessary climate to host the Games. 
As much as I love debating the performance of fake snow, the Olympic Games presents a much bigger quandary to be discussed. It’s no secret that mega events like these bring prestige, international exposure and, in normal times, a whole lot of tourism revenue to economies around the world — but at what cost?
Hosting the Olympics is a multiyear undertaking — arenas, facilities and infrastructure must be built, and the total investment comes out to somewhere in the multibillion dollar range. Especially in the pandemic era of spectatorless events, it begs the question: Why are countries still bidding to host?
Despite the lack of tourism, hosting puts a country back on the map. Long-term investments in infrastructure, as well as the influx of jobs created prior to the event, can boost the economy. Unfortunately, the investment in a city’s glow-up can have big costs for locals. Many farmers in rural areas were resettled as the Chinese government leased out land to wind and solar providers in order to reach green energy goals prior to the start of the Games. 
The urban renewal and long-term gentrification routinely sparked by the Games can certainly promote financial gains, but in no way do they outweigh the heavy human costs. Any so-called sustainability is thoroughly compromised when it is achieved at the expense of the livelihood of citizens.
The International Olympic Committee has prioritized sustainability in recent years but so far has not invested in climate risk and adaptation strategies undertaken by host cities every four years, nor has it established protocols for host countries to adhere to. Despite this relatively superficial promotion, sustainability has become a key trait of the Olympic Games. Beijing’s venues are powered by renewable energy, and hydrogen power is in the limelight, used to light the traditional torch, as well as to fuel vehicles.
Although the carbon-intensity of the Games is arguably on a downward trend, the fact of the matter is that in most cases, sustainability is still open to interpretation. From zero waste promises to the carbon neutrality guaranteed by Beijing officials (offset through carbon credits and reforestry, but that’s a topic for another week), there’s still no set metric for how to legitimately determine environmental impact and offsets. 
Arguably, hosting the Olympics or other mega events is an opportunity for legitimate sustainable development. But all too often, hosting comes at the cost of the city’s own resources and resident well-being, so how green can any event really be? 
Instead of wondering when the world will become too warm to host a legitimate Winter Olympics, we should be internally reflecting on our current climate adaptation strategy or lack thereof.
While Chinese authorities are committed to increasing winter sports participation in China, they’re creating higher demand for something that, by all natural laws, shouldn’t exist at all. Be it running out of water or fossil fuels, resources are finite — at our current rate, we’ll soon hit a breaking point. Although an increased focus on renewables is important for energy-intensive events like the Olympic Games, true sustainable development of any city goes hand in hand with bettering the quality of life of the people that already live there. 
This year’s Winter Olympics — and the general dilemma of artificial snow — is a prime example of our convoluted response to the climate crisis we’ve created. If we continue our current patterns, we’ll only slide further down the slippery slope of the fight against climate change.
