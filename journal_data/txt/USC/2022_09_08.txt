The Edinburgh Festival Fringe — my New York Fashion Week. For the month of August, both established and aspiring creatives travel to Scotland to share their newest works. 
The Fringe hosts all performing art mediums. From operas to circus acts, it’s available at the Fringe. 
However, the biggest section, and the part that I, respectfully, actually care about is the comedy section. Over 40% of the festival is comprised of comedy acts, and the Fringe is celebrated as one of the top comedy festivals in the world. 
Analyzing the lineup at the festival is similar to analyzing the trends of fashion week. Those achieving success in Edinburgh are the same people that will be on every panel show and earn HBO stand-up specials. 
This is especially true for the coveted recipients of Dave’s Edinburgh Comedy Awards (which are sponsored by the British television channel, Dave). 
Winning one of the awards is a sure-fire way to get the attention of producers. The most coveted is the Best Comedy Show prize. At the last festival, Rose Matafeo took home the prize and since has shot into international stardom, even creating her own HBO show “Starstruck.” 
The Best Newcomer Award reaps similar benefits. In the same year as Matafeo, Catherine Cohen was honored with the award for her show “Catherine Cohen: The Twist …? She’s Gorgeous” which was transformed into her own Netflix special. 
There is also the Panel Prize, more commonly referred to as the Spirit of the Fringe, which is awarded to people or groups who make major contributions to the genre of comedy, especially when provided with little funding. Past recipients include Iraq Out & Loud — a performance piece that involved a 24/7 reading of the Chilcot Report which details the U.K.’s involvement in the Iraq War.
The power of the festival cannot be underestimated. However, achieving the Edinburgh dream is becoming less accessible every year. 
For established performers, the festival simply acts as a victory lap. Popular U.K.-based stand-up comedian Nish Kumar performed a week of shows for a venue of 500 people.
Kumar’s Fringe experience wasn’t always a walk in the park — when he first started performing at the Fringe, he was losing money endlessly. It did not matter if he sold out every show he performed — the cost of putting on a show, which for him was £10,000, was too great. 
Most performers simply can’t afford to take the risks Kumar did, even if they so desired.   
The production of a solo show is estimated to be around £6,000-£10,000. This number does not take into account travel, lodging, food and other living expenses. 
Free Fringe is also an option — the program provides the venue for the performer which alleviates a large financial burden, but there’s a catch. The performer must also perform for free. The Free Fringe is also selective, unlike the regular Fringe where any person can put on a show. Even if a person were to be selected, putting on free shows for a month is simply not an accessible option. 
The rising prices of performing at the Fringe have come under fire for years, but the conversation escalated at this year’s award ceremony. 
The Spirit of the Fringe award for 2022 was presented to Best in Class — a group founded by comedian Sian Davies with the goal of supporting up-and-coming, working-class comedians to perform at the Fringe. 
The choice to congratulate a group for its bravery in overcoming the financial barriers of a festival that, as described by awards producer Nica Burns is “open to everyone,” was ironic to say the least. Davies was quick to pick up on this too, using her acceptance speech to call out the “systematic bias” of the festival.
The fight between exploring one’s creative endeavors and paying the bills is nothing new. Without the help of connections or family money, the chances of making it in show business were always slim, but the Fringe was supposed to be the place any person with a dream could go.   
So, while I will continue to follow the Fringe every August, I can’t help but mourn all the brilliant acts I will never be able to see simply because they don’t have thousands of dollars of expendable income.

Marvel’s most controversial and disputed Disney+ series of the year, “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law” premiered Aug. 18. Following an abundance of opinions from platforms such as IMBd and Rotten Tomatoes, audiences are Hulk-smashing the thumbs down button on this highly anticipated show despite only three episodes airing as of publication.
Created and written by comedy television writer Jessica Gao, “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law” features Tatiana Maslany in a never-before-seen role as the attorney turned superhero, Jennifer Walters, also known as She-Hulk. After Walters is involved in an accidental car crash and transmission of blood with her cousin, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), her life completely changes from promising career lawyer to a super-powered slim version of the Incredible Hulk. 
This transformation leads Walters’ life in a completely new direction, forcing her to adapt to this new condition, as she attempts to still pursue a life outside of heroics. This balance between a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde-like dilemma becomes the premise for this series of nine half-hour episodes whose unprecedented comedic storyline yet social-issue covering platform ultimately showcases Marvel’s exploration of uncharted territories. 
This turn of direction and pacing for Marvel Studios along with the overall quality of the show, has sparked much of the debate for this MCU science experiment, but the question remains: Are these criticisms fair for such a uniquely different series?
In contrast to recent additions of Disney+ series, including “Ms. Marvel” and “Moon Knight,” which received moderate criticism, “She-Hulk” is breaking new records by holding the highest percentage of one-star reviews than any other MCU Disney+ series to date on IMDb with a whopping 38.2% of ratings of over 77,000 falling into that record. 
Putting this into perspective, the series with the second-most one-star reviews of the MCU franchise is “Ms. Marvel,” which averages a 19.9% over almost 93,000 ratings — a near 20% difference from the studio’s next-lowest rated series based on IMDb’s calculations. IMDb is not the only platform that showcased ill sentiments either. Rotten Tomatoes holds a 42% audience score for She-Hulk despite a Tomatometer of 87%. 
In consequence of these low numbers, the question arises: Why is “She-Hulk” performing so poorly in the eyes of the general public? Many feel that “She-Hulk” is hitting below the bar in two factors, computer-generated imaging and poor character writing.
The CGI of “She-Hulk” is noticeably inadequate compared to most MCU series and films. Marvel Studios, usually highly renowned for its visual effects, is under scrutiny due to more recent events that have received constant backlash from their works. 
With VFX workers speaking out against the unrealistic deadlines and poor working conditions, this has placed Marvel’s CGI at an all-time low in effective quality. As a result, She-Hulk, a character who relies exclusively on the application of CGI, has been under fire for its lackluster effects and presentation. 
This spectacle comes as a shock with “She-Hulk” having a budget of $25 million per episode, totaling to $225 million for the nine-episode season. In comparison to other films, this would put “She-Hulk’s” first three episodes more expensive than the whole budget of “The Twilight Saga:  Eclipse” (2010) and the series’s total budget more than Marvel’s pioneer movie, “Iron Man” (2008).
Gao mentioned her struggle with having to cut entire scenes of “She-Hulk” and substitute She-Hulk with more of Jennifer Walters as per requests of producers. The repercussions of these budget issues, VFX controversy and unclear plan became the bane of fans, as it led to unbearable CGI sequences that make Daredevil being blind even more of a blessing.
Though CGI is a large component in the reviews, the most prominent reason is the poor character writing that spoils the enjoyment of why we love Marvel movies. It’s clear that Gao’s purpose in creating this show was to demonstrate an alternative reaction, approach and way of  Hulk’s life through a woman’s experience. It lacks a narrative driven element that showcases the series as a comedy rather than just another piece in the franchise. 
It is true that “She-Hulk” is more of a comedy; however, it takes away character development that Marvel creators usually nail down.  
With such a dynamic show that shatters the commonly seen frameworks of most recent Disney+ series, it is evident that She-Hulk is taking an approach to superhero films in a light-hearted way. This is made clear in comparison with certain shows like “Ms. Marvel” which still holds comedic value similar to the “Spider-Man” films with its highschool setting, yet it perfectly pairs this tone with more solemn elements such as her traumatic family history. As a result, “She-Hulk,” in the most simple definition is a “Saturday Night Live” skit if Hulk was a woman which ironically, would have been better.
Ignoring the contemporary flaws of the series, Marvel should be given credit where credit is due. By straying away from the cemented formula of hero media, it provides a creative take on superhero films that could lead feature projects on diverse avenues of entertainment with “She-Hulk” crawling for others to run. 
“She-Hulk: Attorney at Law” was an anticipated number-one science fair project that failed to make the volcano erupt. Its lack of an execution of a storyline in fast-moving scenes with no context to back up the narrative, coupled with its CGI difficulties that don’t quite hit the landing, demonstrate that despite a successful string of movies and a cinematic universe, not all productions could emulate those same successes. “She-Hulk” is still an extremely young series and has the potential to win back the hearts and minds of superfans, but it’ll take drastic measures to beat out its initial reviews.

In mid-2021, Garwing Lai, a first-year master’s student studying entrepreneurship and innovation, was running in his hometown of Arcadia when he bumped into an old high school friend named Andrew Yeh. As they caught up, their conversation evolved into a brainstorm. They wanted to create a business with the potential to serve as many people as possible — eventually coming up with NextPlate. 
NextPlate, a start-up company which allows college students and others to buy surplus food at significant discounts from restaurants and bakeries around Los Angeles, aims to reduce food waste and inspire the public to take a stance against the issue. NextPlate also seeks to provide affordable meals for students, especially those struggling with food insecurity. The app, launched in April 2022, currently serves more than 1000 individuals and 20 restaurants in and around the USC area.
Both Yeh, who graduated from the University of Washington in 2015 with a degree in communication, and Lai were interested in starting a company with a social impact, drawn to tackling the problem of food waste. They noticed that the issue is widely prevalent, yet one that often goes unrecognized.  
“There’s a lot of things that you don’t really think about, like bakeries who have failed products,” Yeh said. “A lot of times they just throw it away. Restaurants who cook a lot of rice every day — at the end of the day, if the rice doesn’t get sold, it gets thrown away. But as consumers we don’t really think about that … So what we’re trying to do is make people more aware that there is a lot of this food waste out there and that there are solutions.”
84% of unsold food in American restaurants is thrown out, according to a 2014 study by Food Waste Reduction Alliance. American restaurants produce 25,000 to 75,000 pounds of food waste each year; globally, restaurants contribute 40% to the 1.3 billion tons of food waste annually.
When talking with their restaurant partners, NextPlate discovered some common reasons why food is thrown out, including the expiration of ingredients with short shelf-lives, mistakes while cooking or preparing orders, canceled deliveries and extras. Some of these items are then sold by restaurants at marked-down prices on NextPlate. 
In 2020, 29% of four-year college students surveyed by the Hope Center for College, Community and Justice reported experiencing low or very low levels of food security. 
“This is a really good platform to help students since a lot of these restaurants with surplus are willing to sell it for a very cheap [price], giving an additional option for students for affordable meals,” Lai said. 
On the app, users can scroll through deals posted by different restaurants, and “favorite” restaurants to receive notifications when new deals become available. After purchasing, they are able to pick up their meal at the store. 
Users can also find information about each restaurant on the app, including the number of meals that have been “rescued” by other consumers. Movita Juice Bar, which neighbors Fertitta Hall, has been partnered with NextPlate for 5 months and has saved more than 445 meals at the time of publication, according to the app. Subway near University Gateway has saved more than 105 meals in the 5 months it has been on NextPlate. 
One of the biggest challenges Lai and Yeh faced as they developed the business was managing the double-sided nature of the platform. 
“It’s kind of a chicken and the egg situation,” Lai said. “How do we get the students if there’s not enough restaurants or how do we get the restaurants if we don’t have any students? And so trying to match those up in the beginning was one of the toughest things.”
Especially as NextPlate grows, Lai and Yeh said maintaining balance continues to be a big consideration.  
Junior communication major Katherine Han, now part of the NextPlate team, originally learned about the platform through a friend. At the time, NextPlate was providing promo codes for one free meal, so Han decided to try the app out. Her first order was a rice bowl at Ramen Kenjo, which she had never tried before. 
“I was really pleasantly surprised,” Han said. “I was like, ‘this is kind of a cool concept because it made me try something new and it was actually really good.’”
Han continued using the app and eventually became a NextPlate ambassador. She said she appreciates how NextPlate helps students incorporate more sustainable practices into their lives while also lowering their dining costs. 
“We all want to help our environment, obviously with climate change and everything that has been going on with our world,” Han said. “I think any small way that we can try to help is great … It’s not like this is an unnecessary product. It’s not adding anything to your day. We all have to eat eventually.”
Jeffrey Lee, a junior majoring in communications, was also introduced to NextPlate by a friend, becoming an early adopter of the app and eventually part of the team. Growing up, the main source of Lee’s family’s income came from his dad’s Ph.D. stipend. They had to be conscious about their expenses, including food. In high school speech and debate, Lee centered his original advocacy speech on food waste, and as an Eagle Scout, organized a basic needs drive. 
“It’s always been an issue that’s been personal to me and been at the back of my mind,” Lee said. “So once I first learned about NextPlate, I kind of jumped on the opportunity to continue my work to try and fight food insecurity.”
Since the company’s launch, NextPlate has increased its partnerships with restaurants around L.A. and continues to promote the app through different strategies, including passing out donuts to students on campus and looking to partner with campus organizations such as the Food Recovery Network of USC and FoodEase USC to reach those in need. 
Going forward, NextPlate plans to add more restaurants to the platform. Getting businesses on board was initially difficult, but Lai and Yeh worked closely with their first restaurants to develop the business-facing side of the NextPlate platform. Currently, they are in discussion with USC Hospitality about possible partnerships with USC dining halls. 
“Our immediate goal is to really make this a very USC-centered app,” Lai said. “We want to showcase that this platform came out of USC … Whenever students miss a meal because they can’t afford it or are stressed out about going out to eat, or just need a quick bite — there’s options around campus to be able to purchase something at [a] discount.”

USC has added an early action option for all future first-year applicants, beginning with the 2022-23 admission cycle. Individuals applying to USC under the new option —  including merit scholarship applicants — have a deadline of Nov. 1, instead of the regular decision deadline of Jan. 15. 
Prior to the change, all students applying to USC needed to submit applications by Jan. 15, with the exception being those applying to an arts program or for a merit scholarship, who were both required to submit their applications by Dec. 1. 
Under the new application process, there are three application groups: merit scholarship applicants, special program applicants and regular decision applicants. 
Merit scholarship applicants need to apply under the early action deadline of  Nov. 1. Those applicants will be notified of their admission decision in mid-to-late January — admission to USC with the chance of earning a merit scholarship or a deferral to the regular decision pool.
Those applying to the arts or other special programs at USC, such as the Iovine and Young Academy, must submit their applications by Dec. 1. All applicants under this category, will also be considered for merit scholarships. 
Applicants who are not applying for a merit scholarship or a special program must submit their applications by Jan. 15. Both special program applicants and regular decision applicants will be notified of their admission status by April 1. 
Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold told the Daily Trojan that the University added this “formal” early action deadline mostly due to public opinion. 
“For many years, many constituents … have expressed an interest in USC offering some sort of a formal early option, and we felt that early action is a much more responsible option than early decision,” Brunold said, noting that the “binding” nature of early decision did not align with what USC wanted for its applicants. 
“We feel that it’s important that our applicants still have the flexibility to compare and contrast different colleges,” he said, “yet still have an opportunity to express their interest in USC by applying early.”
While Brunold said that the Office of Admission does not have a prediction as to how the addition of an early action option will affect acceptance rates and other statistics, he mentioned that the option may give USC earlier insights regarding the makeup of its incoming classes. 
The University is interested in seeing whether the percentage of applicants who submit by the early deadlines — previously 60%, according to Brunold —will change when the formal early action deadline is added. 
Brunold said the most significant impacts of the change are for the admissions and recruitment offices at the University. Applications will need to be read earlier; therefore, University recruitment activities will be held earlier as well — now in the spring instead of the fall. 
“Traditionally, at USC, most of our in person high school visits, college fairs … have been done in the fall months, and then [the admissions and recruitment team] comes back to campus around Thanksgiving and begins reading applications,” Brunold said. “Now, with the earlier deadline, people will be coming back to campus, maybe in mid-October, and begin reading then.”
Cristian Cardona-Serrano, a freshman studying philosophy, politics and economics, said he’s “happy” that USC decided to add an early action option for future application cycles because the original policy caused some confusion for him and his peers. He noted that a few people he knew missed consideration for merit scholarships because of the lack of clarity surrounding the deadline. 
“Once you have that official name,” Cardona-Serrano said, “it gets a little bit more serious. With the merit scholarship deadline, there’s no actual title to it … I knew a lot of people who just didn’t apply that day and were like ‘Oh, I’ll just do it on the regular deadline.’”
Cardona-Serrano said he has no hard feelings towards the fact that USC did not implement this earlier, though he said that he would have benefitted from the option when he applied last year. 
“If I applied early and got the news early, that would have … made my choice for USC a lot easier,” Cardona-Serrano said. “But I’m happy that it’s going to be available for future applicants. What’s past is past, and I’m just glad USC is taking the steps forward for other students to have a much better application process.”
Daniel Pons, a freshman majoring in architecture, recommended potential applicants use the new early action option to express interest in USC. He did, however, note that there is one possible drawback to USC adding early action: it puts students who know they want to apply to the University at an advantage over those who don’t know if the school is right for them.
Pons said he wouldn’t have been able to apply early because of his parents’ immigration status. 
“Given my parents were from Argentina, I was very unaware of the college application process and which colleges would best suit me,” Pons said. “ I did manage to apply early action to the schools I did want to apply early action to, but my fear is that for me, at least, [as] someone whose parents weren’t informed … I don’t know if I would have known about USC in time.”
Matt Strickland, a junior majoring in electrical and computer engineering, also said that they appreciate the new option, especially given the chances of deferral. 
“I feel like it definitely gives a better chance for students who would usually not make it in the regular decisions round to have another chance to shine,” Strickland said.  
Strickland recommends future applicants take advantage of early action as well. 
“If you’re really dead-set on USC, I would just use all the chances you can get, so … definitely take early action,” Strickland said.

Women’s volleyball started the season just about as strong as anyone could ask for, but a pair of intense matches on the road caused the team’s recent momentum to fizzle out.
After their fourth consecutive win of the season against the University of Northern Iowa Friday morning, the Trojans were humbled with losses to No. 17 Creighton University Friday night and No. 16 University of Kentucky Saturday.
“I definitely didn’t think it was a mismatch,” head coach Brad Keller said. “We have an entirely new team that’s learning about ourselves, the game, the touch of the ball and everything else. And so I just don’t think we had enough hours in the gym to sustain against them.”
The tournament began with a historic performance from senior opposite hitter Skylar Fields, who landed 22 kills against Northern Iowa in a 3-1 winning effort for the Trojans. It was the second most kills in a match for Fields in her career, second only to a 2021 performance against University of Kansas where the then junior at University of Texas, Austin swung for 26 kills in a five-set victory.
Senior opposite hitter Emilia Weske also showed out against the Panthers, racking up a team-high 13 digs and 4 aces while  scoring 10 kills for USC. The Trojans’ graduate middle blocker Kalyah Williams also added 13 kills to the scoring barrage.
Later that night, the Trojans were tasked with playing tournament host Creighton, the No. 17 ranked team in the nation by the American Volleyball Coach Association. It was USC’s first matchup versus a ranked opponent this season, and statistically, the program’s worst game offensively. A season high in errors (26) and season low in hitting percentage (.189) dragged down a previously undefeated Trojan team for a 1-3 loss to the Bluejays.
Creighton senior outside hitter Keeley Davis was the offensive standout of the game, leading the field with 16 kills and 3 aces against USC.
Coach Brad Keller’s squad went face-to-face with No. 16 Kentucky on Saturday night, and not only were the Trojans swept 0-3, but they were also outscored in every major statistical category — most notably aces (1-6) and blocks (3-8). 
Shortcomings at both the service line and net were the difference in the game, personified by Wildcats junior opposite Reagan Rutherford scoring 14 kills and junior middle blocker Elise Goetzinger blocking 4 shots.
“They have two pin hitters that hit with a ton of heat and a ton of range,” Keller said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I think their biggest weapon was their serve. I have not seen a team serve as aggressively and be as dominant as they were.”
USC will have a few days to recoup after back-to-back losses before playing a two game series against the University of Hawaii starting on Friday.
The Warriors are 2-4 on the season, fresh off of a five set loss to No. 22 UCLA on Sunday.
“It’s one of the most difficult places to play,” Keller said. “And that’s why I want to bring my team out here, because of how wonderful the culture is. They’re a team that’s going to be scrappy, and play a ton of great defense. I think it’s going to be quite an incredible challenge for us.”

Welcome to the first issue of “Heat Check,” detailing the hottest storylines and drama dominating Major League Baseball headlines as we inch closer to the postseason. There’s been a lot of baseball before this column’s debut, but for the first edition, we’ll check in on a couple teams from the two largest markets in the United States.
Mama, there goes that man. Every time I start to doubt Aaron Judge’s ability, he proves me wrong with another earth-shatteringly emphatic blast. Judge banged his 54th home run of the season on Monday and remains on pace to blow past the American League record of 61 homers. To some, this would be considered the overall MLB record as well, since  every player who has surpassed Roger Maris in the past has been linked to steroid usage. If Judge is to do so, he would be a shoe-in for both the AL MVP and the owner of one of the largest contracts in professional sports history.
Despite their $6 billion Forbes valuation, New York has struggled to lock down their homegrown star with contract extension talks dying out due to Judge’s high demands. Judge has been noticeably skittish whenever asked about his contract situation with the team and has likely resolved to head to the free agent market at the end of the year. 
He would be the top star on the market and would provide an otherworldly powerful bat to any contending ball club. As a 30 year old, Judge’s long-term outlook doesn’t burn as bright as fellow stars San Diego Padres slugger Juan Soto or longtime Atlanta Brave Dansby Swanson but should provide at least four to five more years of elite-level right-handed production.
Outside of Judge, things are clearly not looking up for New York right now as the Dodgers have overtaken the Yankees as the best team in baseball.
I’ll break it down for you. Since the All-Star break, the Dodgers have been a highly-efficient, sexy Lamborghini Aventador, while the Yankees (aside from Judge) have been a rundown 2005 Subaru Baja. The Death Star of Los Angeles leads MLB with 94 wins as of Sept. 7, making them the only club thus far to reach the coveted 90-win plateau. The Boys from the Bronx, however, finally reached 80 wins on Sept. 4. What makes that more tragic is the fact that the Yankees were the first club to reach 70 wins way back on Aug. 1. Safe to say, these two ball clubs could not be much different.
Injuries to all-stars Nestor Cortes, Andrew Benintendi and Giancarlo Stanton have certainly limited New York’s production, but that’s not all. Trade deadline acquisitions such as starting pitcher Frankie Montas (5.87 ERA as a Yankee) and the outfielder Benintendi (currently nursing a broken wrist) have been duds, while deadline departures Joey Gallo and Jordan Montgomery look like entirely different players. 
While the Yankees have swooned, Baltimore has surged, with 26 victories in the second half and a real shot at reaching the postseason for the first time since 2017. Rookie Adley Rutschman has powered the Orioles from the shallows of mediocrity and is in the running with Seattle’s Julio Rodríguez for the AL Rookie of the Year. Recent callup Gunnar Henderson (and his luxurious flow) could prove to be the difference maker for the underdog Orioles in the playoff hunt. The once titanic 20-game Yankee lead in the AL East has fallen to a mere 4.5 over with the Tampa Bay Rays. Is Baltimore storming back from their 9.5 game deficit probable? No. Possible? Certainly.
Mookie Betts, Trea Turner and Freddie Freeman have been spectacular as of late – with Betts winning the National League Player of the Week for the last week of August. Combined with the overpoweringly dominant pitching staff, the Dodgers have essentially clinched the NL West title and the No. 1 seed in the postseason, with their 19 game lead on the Padres reaching unsurmountable heights.
While L.A. and their most likely 110+ win regular season record seems like a World Series grand slam, don’t be so sure. A Fangraphs-produced 17.3% chance at winning the series is by no means a certainty, and the baseball world has come to understand by now that anything is possible in October. A year ago, the Dodgers were facing a very similar situation – and we all know how that turned out.

The men’s water polo team took second place at the Triton Invitational in La Jolla this past weekend, securing wins over Concordia University Irvine, UC Irvine and Pepperdine University, but losing the title match to UCLA. After this first tournament of the season, No. 2 USC holds a 3-1 record overall. 
An initial shutout win over Concordia, 24-0, and a second win over No. 12 UC Irvine, 10-4, pushed the Trojans into a semifinal round against No. 10 Pepperdine. 
In their first matchup of day two against Pepperdine, Massimo Di Martire, USC’s newest graduate student recruit from Italy, scored a quick goal in the first quarter. The Waves tied up the score in a couple of minutes, but the Trojans followed that goal with four more in a row throughout the first and second periods. By halftime, USC held a four-goal lead on Pepperdine, only to dominate in the third quarter, scoring five more goals to Pepperdine’s two. The Trojans scored for the last time at the beginning of the fourth period, and while the Waves came out strong for a four-goal comeback, it wasn’t enough to take the win. With strong defense and a 13-save performance from goalie Kyle McKenney, USC beat Pepperdine 12-8 in the semifinal round, propelling them to the title game against No. 3 UCLA later that day. 
In their second game of the day, the Trojans deployed their defense against the Bruins. Redshirt sophomore goalie Blake Jackson came out strong, making 11 total saves and holding the Bruins at only one goal in the first and second quarters. UCLA led throughout the first half, but the Trojans tied up the score at the end of the second quarter and beginning of the third quarter with goals from Di Martire and redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen. Both teams converted a few more goals through tight defense, and by the end of the third quarter, the Trojans were only down by two points. The crosstown rivals matched each other goal for goal in the fourth quarter, with junior driver Carson Kranz and redshirt senior Jake Ehrhardt of the Trojans knocking in one goal each. However, it wasn’t enough to overtake the Bruins, and USC lost 6-8. 
“We usually aren’t playing teams like UCLA, or one of the more top four teams, this early in the season, and we lost this time. But I think it’s good that we saw this early in the season and we can come back and learn from that and beat them next time,” said junior 2-meter Max Miller. 
Miller enters his third season of USC water polo with solid collegiate water polo experience, scoring seven goals in a shortened season as a true freshman and 12 goals as a sophomore. Team chemistry is a huge aspect of the game, and Miller believes USC has that piece of the puzzle figured out.
“We’ve become a pretty close team, especially over our Europe trip over the summer, and we’ve really just been playing well together. I think we played better than I anticipated we would for our first tournament of the season,” Miller said. 
Miller’s positive outlook on the final game of the tournament is also shared by Jackson. 
“I felt solid, I thought I played pretty well. It was kind of my first time ever starting in a big game against UCLA. We lost that, which was a bummer, obviously, definitely a lot of room to improve there, but it was a really cool experience. Happy to get my first big start,” Jackson said. 
Last season, Jackson made his career debut against University of La Verne, making three saves in the second half. Before this weekend’s matchups, Jackson has appeared in four games, setting a previous career high of 10 saves against Santa Clara University. 
The rest of the season will present more challenges, but the Trojans are ready to face them head-on. Jackson feels “very confident” going into this season.
“It’s obviously still early in the season, but now we know what we need to work on,” Jackson said. “And all the core elements of a successful team we have; we have good chemistry, good communication, and our defense is looking really good, so it’s looking to be a good season.” 
The Trojans open at home on Thursday with back-to-back games against California State University, Long Beach and Golden West College. On Saturday, USC will head to Claremont for another double header and face Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Pomona-Pitzer.

My parents immigrated to the United States in the ‘90s after living their entire childhood in a civil war. To say that they’ve seen some shit would be an understatement. 
My dad told me that he either saw or heard about his aunt’s house being blown up, essentially killing his aunt and, I presume, her family — my memory is still foggy on the details. My father is very candid about his childhood. He told me all the details of his unfaithful, abusive father and ill mother — all the good, bad, fun and depressing nitty-gritty details.
Both my parents grew up in immense poverty and took the 1500+ mile trek from El Salvador in their late teens, early twenties to the U.S. seeking the “American Dream” as most immigrants did. My parents had their bouts with the U.S. government, whether it be with immigration issues or other things that popped up. 
While they try not to live in constant fear because it just wouldn’t be a healthy way of living, it’s always in the back of their minds. It makes sense. From a really young age, you’re told to stay inside and not leave the house because you might die from stray bullets or get taken away to become a child soldier. You have to work in the fields at a young age to make pennies and harvest food for your family simply to survive. Even in the U.S., there have been conflicts between my parents’ families which have caused my extended family to sort of distance themselves from us.
Yet, with all of this, both my parents, for the most part, try to live with as much joy as possible to raise two kids in the U.S. by themselves. I’d say life is relatively good, but I always knew something was off as a kid. I never met the majority of my family or any of my grandparents before they died. There’s been some random phone calls from aunts and uncles, but even though we’re blood-related, they feel more like strangers.
I was never able to go to El Salvador because of the lengthy process it took my parents to ask the U.S. government for permission to leave the country and be able to come back. Also, my dad had an immigration issue at some point when I was in elementary school — which just complicated things even more. Since the age of 11, I went on multiple trips to New York to meet immigration lawyers which bored me out of my mind — having to tag along because I was seen as the “golden ticket” to residency. 
With everything going on in their lives, they did their best to make sure me and my sister’s lives were different and safe. While I disagreed with a lot of their choices in parenting as a kid, I totally understand when reflecting on their own upbringings. My childhood friends, who are still some of my closest friends to this day, would invite me to sleepovers countless times, and they always knew it was pointless because my parents would always say no. But they knew I appreciated being included. My dad thought it was a stupid American tradition that was “dangerous” because you never know what could happen.
As a kid who, thankfully, was able to grow up in a safe neighborhood his entire life, this made no sense to me whatsoever. But to the person who grew up in a literal warzone for the first 20 years of their life, it was second nature. I never hung out with any of my school friends until my senior year because of that reason. 
It was pretty lonely during this point of my life. I had a lot of restrictions during my teen years, and I kind of wished I didn’t have the family I had. I love my family and would never want to swap them out for anything, but at the time, it felt like I was being deprived of joy and fun on purpose, which is all I wanted as a kid.
But I never chose to be rebellious as a kid out of fear. There was too much shit in my head to consider it, and there was always that looming panic that I would disappoint my parents. That doesn’t mean I was a good student though. I rarely did my homework, never studied, no extracurriculars, failed a class and nearly failed a couple others, and sometimes skipped class just to talk to friends. I was an average student. I just chose to stay away from trouble because of my parents, but we all make our mistakes and, occasionally, I would be around not the best of people at times.
Looking back now, I’m grateful for the opportunities I have. I’m not even talking about attending USC or possibly graduating debt-free (Thanks, Biden). Simply being a U.S. citizen and being raised here is an amazing privilege in itself that I almost didn’t have: My dad had to convince my mom not to go back to El Salvador to have me there. I’ve always been in this weird limbo where I hate shit but appreciate it at the same time. Maybe I’m just confused. 
Anyways, I turned 21 this July, which is the magical number in the eyes of the U.S. government where I can finally petition to have my parents gain residency. And even that has proven to be a bumpy road. But at least I was able to go 21 years with my parents, even with the deportation fears during the Trump presidency era, and give my parents the coveted papeles that seemed like a dream to obtain. So I’d say while life can suck balls, there are enjoyable moments sprinkled throughout — which doesn’t make it as miserable.

Although the re-normalization of the in-person school year makes Zoom University seem like ages ago, the repercussions of online learning still linger. Room scan software, which was widely adopted by universities, schools and other institutions for test-proctoring purposes over the pandemic, was officially ruled unconstitutional Aug. 22. 
The privacy risk regarding room scan software was brought up by Aaron Ogletree, a student at Cleveland State University. According to NPR, Ogletree sued his university, stating that it is unconstitutional to have a room scan as part of the proctoring measure before his online test. In response to this, U.S. district court Judge J. Philip Calabrese concluded that the room scan is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.
Ogletree is not the only student who has felt concerned about the privacy violations room scanning software poses. Ever since universities moved completely online in response to the pandemic and started using e-proctoring software, students across the nation found themselves frantically ensuring that their rooms were spick and span, and the fan-fiction on their desk was not mistaken for their notes. ​ While universities such as Cleveland State and USC argued that such measures established a sense of fairness and academic integrity, students didn’t have control over parents barging into their rooms or their siblings yelling through the walls. 
According to YR media, students have an additional stressor as the recorded data usually have years-long retention periods. This data, if not stored and protected properly by the e-proctoring company, may lead to security and privacy risks. 
Vice writers Todd Feathers and Janus Rose provided additional insight on what exactly an e-proctoring software can access once students start to use it on their computers, stating, “The software turns students’ computers into powerful invigilators — webcams monitor eye and head movements, microphones record noise in the room, and algorithms log how often a test taker moves their mouse, scrolls up and down on a page and pushes keys. The software flags any behavior its algorithm deems suspicious for later viewing by the class instructor.” 
But how can a software distinguish test anxiety from suspicious behavior when the program was mathematically designed to represent the “perfect” or “ideal” student? Spoiler alert: It can’t.
In an interview with Vice, Shea Swauger, an educational technology researcher at the University of Colorado Denver’s Auraria Library said, “anything outside of that ideal is treated with suspicion,” and cognitive and physical disabilities don’t make the cut amongst these ideal testing behavior traits. 
As we remain in limbo with the pandemic, hybrid models of learning and testing continue to be ingrained in many classes to promote accessibility and public health. With this, many professors are finally breaking away from the anxiety-inducing, reductive, standardized exams and finding new ways to analyze how well students are retaining class material. Duke University’s learning innovation blog suggests giving students formative questions that require them to make analyses instead of providing a single correct answer. From individual projects to short writing essays, there are several ways educators can ensure academic integrity outside of a proctored exam. 
Nonetheless, even if the pandemic never occurred and we never enrolled in Zoom University, timed, closed book exams should be a thing of the past. Not only does it fail to engage students with the material, but it is also the very definition of inequitable. 
Research conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Psychology empirically proved that time-limited tests don’t work. This isn’t just a myth or students complaining about their classes. The current majority of “testing” is scientifically proven not to work. 
So, to all USC professors: Let’s break out of that old-fashioned unreliable shell and blossom into a new era of education where we put students’ privacy and education first.
