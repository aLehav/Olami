Beginning next fall, the Institute for Multimedia Literacy will be moved into its new home in the Media Arts and Student Services building.

The four-story, 60,000-square-foot building, located adjacent to the George Lucas and Steven Spielberg buildings of the School for Cinematic Arts on 34th Street and McClintock Avenue, will house classrooms, labs, offices, a digital theater and cutting-edge technology to support the endeavors of students pursuing a major, minor or honors program at the IML.
The 15-year-old institute is dedicated to empowering its students in the interpretation and design of media through the use of media applications and tools.
IML Multimedia Lab Manager Michael Bodie said although the IML is a division of the School of Cinematic Arts, its current location at West Adams Boulevard between Hoover and Figueroa streets makes it seem far more isolated and mysterious for students.
“It’s sort of an island effect,” Bodie said.
And partly because of that, the IML has faced challenges with garnering attention from students and faculty. Director of Academic Programs Holly Willis said the IML faculty hopes the institute’s new central location on campus will help showcase IML students’ work more effectively.
“Hopefully there will be a good flow of people coming in and seeing what we do and walking through the lobby to see the displays and examples of student work,” Willis said.
Previously, IML classes have been housed in both the current main off-campus building and in the Taper Hall of the Humanities.
Josh Kim, a sophomore majoring in business administration and an IML student, said the new on-campus location could also make IML students’ interactions with faculty and staff more effective, leading to a better educational experience.
“Since it’s closer and actually on campus, students will go to office hours more, which should obviously improve grades and scores,” Kim said. “I’m just glad I won’t have to go to Adams Boulevard just for office hours or class.”
The new building will also be home to the Interactive Media Division, including the Game Innovation Lab and the Interdivisional Media Arts and Practice Ph.D program, which offers courses dedicated to game design, animation and audio. Bodie said that bringing these like-minded programs under one roof is all part of an effort to streamline and consolidate the programs for better interaction.
“One of the ideas with the new building was also to put the groups for the working of the new media and new forms of technology in the same space,” Bodie said.
To accommodate these programs, the building will be outfitted with cutting-edge technology, including labs, digital offices and furniture that have been designed to be fluid in order to facilitate collaboration.
“In the lobby area, for example, there are six touch screens where students and faculty will be able to create touch-based projects that we can showcase there,” Willis said.
Willis said she hopes that IML students will use their time in the Media Arts building to explore the other programs based there and collaborate with students beyond those just in the IML.
Kevin Tsukii, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism who plans on undertaking the Honors in Multimedia Studies program, said the institute’s move will have a positive effect on the IML’s identity within the School of Cinematic Arts.
“IML has always seemed so disjointed from the SCA,” Tsukii said. “Now that they’re physically sharing a building, it just changes how you look at the institute.”

Students and faculty in USC’s River Landing Collective have been furiously planning how to revamp the Los Angeles River with lush, effective green space.
Waterway · There are 51 banks along the Los Angeles River. The River Landing Collective hopes to install a park on one of these channels. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
But now they’re eyeing a different kind of green, The collective is among the top 10 in the running to win a $100,000 grant from LA2050, an organization that works to shape the future of Los Angeles.
The River Landing Collective, which is composed of USC architecture students and faculty, has created a prototype of a park they hope represents the future of the Los Angeles River. With the $100,000 grant, the group would fund the installation of a temporary park along concrete channel on the river in Elysian Valley.
Adjunct Assistant Professor of Landscape Architecture Alexander Robinson, who led the group of students in developing the project, said the prototype will serve as a model for future parks at the L.A. River. All combined, the usable space along the river is almost enough to match the size of Central Park in New York City.
“We want to generate a lot of excitement about the river and help people develop high expectations of how it should be and how it could be a part of their lives in the future,” Robinson said.
One of 279 submissions received in the contest, the River Landing Collective made it into the top 10 by earning enough votes on Facebook. Jean Yang, a graduate architecture student involved in the project, said the group secured their ranking by utilizing various social networks.
“The last stage was focusing on getting out the vote,” Yang said. “[Robinson] mobilized us to get on Facebook, Twitter, etc. and encourage people to vote for the River Landing project.”
The River Landing Collective argues that the project benefits the city by providing it with more park space and encouraging residents to develop a relationship with the river.
“The idea is that eventually everyone has these summer parks,” Robinson said. “I think it’s important that we start to develop a more meaningful and colorful relationship to the river.”
Because of legal reasons, however, the park may be a long way off.
The group’s first step will be to acquire a standard film permit from the city in order to make a short film about its park prototype over the summer season. With the money from the grant, the group would construct a temporary park for one weekend and make a film about the build.
Robinson said he hopes to cast both students and residents of the local community in the film, which will be used to promote city and residential support for the project.
“The film would be about building this park landing and using it and imagining what it would be like to have a park here,” Robinson said.
Even if the collective does not earn the grant, Robinson said he hopes that the idea will continue to inspire students.
“If we don’t get the grant, I think it will still take on another form and continue because there is so much interest in it,” Robinson said. “We obviously wouldn’t be able to do anything close to what we had in mind, but we would re-assess it.”
The winner of the grant will be announced no later than May 8.

City Councilman Eric Garcetti has moved into a double-digit lead in the Los Angeles mayoral race over his opponent, City Controller Wendy Greuel, according to a new USC Sol Price School of Public Policy/Los Angeles Times poll.
The poll, which was distributed to 500 likely voters in the general election, indicates that Garcetti boasts a 10-point lead with the support of 50 percent of voters compared to Greuel’s 40 percent. The general election will be held on May 21.
Though Greuel would be the first female mayor of Los Angeles, if elected, the poll finds that she is trailing Garcetti among female voters. Garcetti has the support of 50 percent of female voters and 51 percent of male voters, compared with Greuel’s 41 and 38 percent, respectively.
“Greuel may be suffering from a Hillary Clinton problem,” said Dan Schnur, director of the USC Price/L.A. Times Poll and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, in a statement to the press. “Clinton emphasized her qualities of strength and toughness to such a degree that it mitigated her gender advantage. The difference is that Greuel might still have the time to fix it.”
The poll also found that Garcetti leads among young voters, as well as white and Latino voters. Though the poll indicates that black voters are leaning toward Greuel, the poll acknowledged its sample size of black voters was too small to draw any firm conclusions.
The poll indicates that Greuel’s support from organized labor may also be hurting her election chances, as many voters view her as being tied to labor unions. When asked who the phrase “Cares more about unions representing city employees than Los Angeles as a whole” describes more, 46 percent of polled voters said Greuel, whereas only 26 percent said Garcetti.
Garcetti also won among voters as someone who represents all of Los Angeles, can make tough decisions and has a strong vision for L.A.
On the issues, voters trusted Greuel more to handle the budget and education but trusted Garcetti to handle crime, jobs and mass transit.
The poll also indicated that reforming pensions for public employees is a major concern for voters, with 34 percent of voters reported saying that it should be “one of the most important priorities” for the new mayor and 45 percent saying it should be “important, but not at the top of the list.”
“Pensions are important and can be indicative of a candidate’s values,” said Amy Levin, vice president of Democratic polling firm Benenson Strategy Group who conducted the poll, in a statement to the press. “But with an election at this level, it’s much more about voters and what is going on in their daily lives and what they want for their families than about city budgets.”

The 2013 executive board for the Interfraternity Council, elected November 2012, has focused its efforts on increasing safety on The Row this semester by collaborating with the Dept. of Public Safety and working more closely with the Los Angeles Police Department.

“One of the main responsibilities of my job, if not the top responsibility, is ensuring safety on The Row,” IFC President Ofek Lavian said. “All the other things that we do come only after safety.”
As a result of new policies this semester, the number of  alcohol-related incidents has been significantly reduced. Though there were 86 recorded alcohol-related transports to the hospital last semester prior to the new policies, only 40 alcohol-related transports were reported this semester.
“This semester, the number of [ambulance] transports has been lower on The Row than off The Row for the first time in a really long time,” Lavian said.
Though the university itself is always concerned with students safety, Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Denzil Suite applauded the new efforts, saying “IFC has really taken the lead on safety precautions.”
Since his election, Lavian and his executive board have instituted a number of new policies aimed at increasing security.
Houses are now encouraged to notify IFC of all social functions beforehand so that it can be prepared for any security issues that might arise.
In conjunction with these new policies, IFC board members and the presidents and risk managers of each house that plans to have events during the next week meet every Thursday with the DPS officers that will be on duty.
“We have officers that volunteer to be Greek liaisons and meet regularly with IFC to discuss safety concerns on the Row,” DPS Captain David Carlisle said.
Lavian said enhanced communication with DPS and LAPD has been essential to implementing the new policies.
“We can contact [DPS Captain Steve Alegre] whenever there’s something urgent,” Lavian said, “We also notify him whenever something is going well and discuss ways to prevent issues later on.”
Lavian and his board have also increased the expectations for chapter risk managers. This semester, risk managers in each house were required to go through training with DPS officers. In addition, an official IFC board position called the director of risk management was added to oversee safety precautions.
Lavian said all of these safety precautions have been part of IFC’s long-term goal of taking more responsibility for security on The Row.
“We want to be a self-governing unit so that we are able to be the most successful and effective Greek system we can be,” said IFC Vice President of Communications Tanner Sandoval. “We are all very capable individuals, and we should not have to put extra stress on the university.”
Lavian said he hopes to develop a program with the LAPD that would allow students to call ambulances anonymously if a safety issue arises at an event.
“As of now, if there’s an alcohol-related transport, the house [where it occurred] can get in trouble for it,” Lavian said.
According to Levian,  fear of getting in trouble often prevents people from calling an ambulance in a dangerous situation.
“I think that is very immoral — and downright disgusting — because it is essentially de-incentivizing the houses to do the right thing.”
Lavian said he hopes that he can work with the university, DPS and the Los Angeles Fire Department to address this issue by the end of his presidency in December.
Looking forward, Lavian said the IFC’s executive board aims to allow houses to register events through IFC, rather than through the university.
Suite said the university is ultimately encouraging IFC to become more autonomous and responsible for safety issues on The Row.
“For any new policy we would need to see a specific proposal,” Suite said. “The goal is always to have individuals and chapters take responsibility for their own events.”

Entering the postseason fresh off of a fifth-place finish at the PING/ASU Invitational, the top-ranked women’s golf team hopes to shrug off any rust or fatigue as it prepares for the start of the Pac-12 Championships in Valencia, Calif.
UCLA will host the event at the difficult Valencia Country Club. The Women of Troy head into the tournament with three tournament victories and an NCAA-leading streak of seven consecutive top-five finishes dating back to 2012.
Still, the squad is set to face stiff competition from one of the nation’s toughest conferences and will battle with five other teams ranked in the top 25. This includes No. 6 Arizona, No. 8 UCLA, No. 11 Stanford, No. 13 Arizona State and No. 14 Washington.
USC head coach Andrea Gaston is particularly impressed by the toughness of this year’s field.
“Many of the nation’s top teams will be here,” Gaston said. “It’s just another preview of NCAA [championships], and we have to be ready to go.”
Arizona and UCLA figure to be USC’s toughest challengers this week. The Wildcats have a team victory at the Dr. Donnis Thompson Invitational and three other top-five finishes. UCLA defeated the Trojans early in the season at the Northrop Grumman Invitational and finished a close second to their crosstown rival at the Sugar Bowl Intercollegiate.
Last week, both Arizona and Stanford finished ahead of the Trojans in Tempe, Ariz. at the PING/ASU invitational, helping to end USC’s three-match winning streak.
The Women of Troy hope to put that loss behind them as they begin a tournament they have won twice in the past five years, including during their 2008 national championship run. USC also claimed a conference championship in 2011, when then-freshman Sophia Popov won an individual title on the first playoff hole.
After three wins as a freshman, one last year as a sophomore and another at this year’s SDSU Farms Invitational, Popov will be looking for her sixth career victory this week. A win would place her alone atop the USC record books.
At the inaugural Pac-12 event in 2012, the team fell to California by one stroke, while Doris Chen, now a sophomore, took home the second consecutive individual victory for a USC freshman. Popov, Chen, freshman Annie Park and junior Rachel Morris have all turned in solid 2013 campaigns and lead their team into the conference tournament as the clear favorite.
“We have incredible depth,” Gaston said. “We have five players capable of finishing in the top 10. Our team has been working hard to prepare, so hopefully, we’ll put ourselves in position to win.”
The No. 1-seeded Women of Troy begin match play early Monday morning alongside the No. 11-seeded Colorado Buffaloes. The event can be followed live at golfstat.com and will be covered on tape delay by the Pac-12 Network.
Lets all go up to Valemcia to watch our amazing Women of TROY capture the Pac-12 in Golf.
Keep the Faith and Fight on !!!!  We have a great group of women who have had an incredible year.
They could add another NCAA Trophy to our collection.  It should be fun. Hope to see you there.\

You would be hard-pressed to think of a better way for the USC women’s water polo to bounce back from its first loss of the season.
Lead the way · USC feshman driver Anni Espar tied for the lead on Friday with three goals in the team’s win over crosstown rival UCLA. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
For the No. 2 Women of Troy (21-1, 5-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation), an 11-6 victory over rival No. 4 UCLA (24-5, 3-3 MPSF) in Westwood on Friday was arguably the perfect way to finish the regular season.
USC junior two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist and freshman driver Anni Espar led the effort with three goals apiece in the regular-season finale, as the Women of Troy looked to rebound after their hopes for an undefeated season were dashed by a 6-4 home loss to then-No. 2 Stanford on April 13.
With the victory, USC locked up the No. 2 seed in the upcoming MPSF championships.
The Women of Troy started things off with an early 2-0 lead behind a power-play goal from junior two-meter Hannah Buckling and a penalty goal from Espar. The two sides exchanged blows in the first half with neither team having a clear advantage. By halftime, USC led 5-4.
The Bruins kept it close in the third period and trailed 6-5 after UCLA attacker Rachel Fattal scored on a power play with 4:36 remaining in the period.
In response, USC’s defense held the Bruins scoreless for 12 minutes and 35 seconds and rattled off five straight goals to pull away for the win.
One of those goals came from sophomore driver Monica Vavic, serving as her 100th career goal. Vavic finished with two goals in the game.
The Bruins also never led in the game, partly a result of USC junior goalie Flora Bolonyai’s eight saves, six of which came in the second half.
Senior driver Dominique Sardo, junior driver Olivia Cummins and Buckling each scored one goal for the Women of Troy, while Fattal led the Bruins with two goals.
This is USC’s second win over UCLA this year and its third consecutive victory over UCLA, including a victory over the Bruins in the 2012 NCAA semifinals.
The Women of Troy hold the No. 2 seed in the 2013 MPSF championships, which begin on Friday in Berkeley, Calif. and end on Sunday. They will face CSU Bakersfield in a first-round matchup at 11 a.m. on Friday.
Great job by Coaches Jovan VAVIC & Marco Pintaric in guiding our     great women’s team this season. We can all be proud of the waterpolo program [men’s & women’s] whch set the standard for excellence at our great university.     We will defeat Bakersfeld in the quarterfinal   and meet ucla in the semi an then play stanford in the MPSF fnial.. It will be a battle royale.
The same  two squads will likely meet in the ncaa final game at Cambridge, MA., as Harvard is hosting the NCAA championship  on Mothers  day weekend .  FIGHT ON & beat the Farm

Though a contradictory figure of speech by definition, oxymorons infiltrate our everyday language. We have the tried-and-true cliches — overused literary paradoxes like “deafening silence” and “sweet sorrow.” We also spread them unwittingly at every turn, with common verbiage such as “act naturally” and “dull roar.”
After scanning the 2013 football depth chart released last week, I wonder if head coach Lane Kiffin understands the inherent contradiction between the terms “2013 USC football” and “depth” and the big oxymoron he has published for the USC fan base. With his job hanging in the balance, Kiffin enters 2013 with a perilously thin roster, once again devoid of honest positional competition and serviceable backups.
Brace yourselves for some dismal math. If everyone returns healthy from their spring injuries, excluding junior wide receiver George Farmer, who is already pronounced out for the season, USC will field 68 scholarship players this season, only 29 of whom are upperclassmen.
The 68 scholarship players are a full seven fewer than what the NCAA allots USC during the sanctions period and 17 fewer than the vast majority of Football Bowl Subdivision teams have on hand.
Despite an abundance of youthful talent, USC noticeably lacks the steadying, if unspectacular, performance of veteran reserves — role players who know their strengths and weaknesses, the level of competition and the playbook.
Two years ago, during USC’s surprising 10-2 season, many veteran upperclassmen — including linebackers Shane Horton and Chris Galippo, offensive tackle Martin Coleman, linebacker Tony Burnett, safeties Marshall Jones and Drew McAllister and wide receivers Brandon Carswell and Brice Butler — contributed meaningfully in their part-time roles. They represented readily playable options for Kiffin in the event a starter sustained an injury or needed extended rest.
Conversely, with a cast of young, unproven wild cards in 2013, the variance on what we might see from this USC team seems exceedingly high, because we have no idea how 18- and 19-year-old depth players will respond once thrown to the wolves of the Pac-12.
Four of the five starting offensive linemen from an underachieving 2012 unit return. The 10 players behind the incumbents, however, own only one career start among them, which came when then-redshirt freshman center Cyrus Hobbi replaced injured Khaled Holmes against Stanford last season. Drawing the unfavorable assignment against a vicious Stanford defensive front seven, Hobbi fared as one would expect an undersized and out-techniqued freshman to perform, failing to demonstrate a readiness to seize a starting role anytime soon.
More inconceivably, inconsistent junior offensive tackle Aundrey Walker doesn’t even have to glance in the rearview mirror next fall, as no scholarship player lurks behind him on the depth chart.
One might put forth other upperclassmen offensive players, such as junior running back D.J. Morgan and fifth-year senior De’Von Flournoy, as likely contributing reserves.
But Kiffin has rarely trusted the oft-injured and fumble-prone Morgan to carry the ball in important situations, outside of Morgan’s short-lived run as the starting tailback to kick off 2011. And Flournoy, despite repeatedly performing well in practice, doesn’t impress Kiffin enough in the vaunted “height-weight-speed” ratio department, thus explaining why he only has one catch so far in his three seasons of eligibility.
A defensive line that experienced a bevy of defections this past winter — first from the 2013 verbal commits, then from a couple of buried depth players — features only one quality upperclassman reserve: junior defensive end J.R. Tavai. In fact, perhaps the only position group on defense that will boast multiple quality veteran reserves is safety, where seniors Demetrius Wright and Gerald Bowman will likely play as experienced second-stringers and impact special teamers.
The purpose of this quick roster survey is not to suggest that experience always trumps young incoming talent. But even on a team with an abundance of young five-star recruits, USC desperately needs backups who understand the conditioning necessary to play against an Oregon offense that runs 90 snaps per game and the determination necessary to go blow-for-blow with Stanford’s bruising linebacker corps. Veteran reserves can buy the young upstarts time as they gradually build up knowledge of the playbook and acclimate to the increased competition.
The drop-off in experience from starter to backup across the board will create headaches for the USC coaching staff when, for all their talents, young players mess up their gap responsibilities on defense or run the wrong route on offense. For every explosive play and glimpse of potential, there will also be mistakes that will cost games.
The confluence of scholarship reductions, poor roster retention and player development has created a fine mess for USC, one that will become quickly evident if the Trojans suffer early-season injuries.

The USC women’s lacrosse team, needing to win its last two games in order to ensure a spot in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament, took care of business on Saturday as it trounced Fresno State 19-1 at McAlister Field in the final home match of the season.
All-purpose · USC freshman attacker/midfielder Caroline Cordrey scored two goals and notched one assist in the team’s win over Fresno St. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Sophomore attacker Olivia Gerton scored four goals and recorded an assist for the Women of Troy (7-9, 4-3 MPSF), which had seven players score two or more goals each. Freshman midfielder Caroline de Lyra led USC with six points (two goals, four assists), while freshman midfielder Amanda Johansen finished with five points (two goals, three assists) and 13 draw controls, two away from tying the NCAA record. Freshman midfielder Paige Bonomi finished with a hat trick of her own.
“Offensively, we played really smart,” Gerton said. “We wanted to work hard and draw the double, then look for the open player. Personally, I just tried to keep my space, not cut to the ball and crowd it. We all worked as a unit to move the ball quickly and efficiently, and that opened up so many opportunities for everyone.”
The 19 goals were the third-highest scoring total for the Women of Troy this season and the most since scoring 23 against LIU Brooklyn on March 1. USC’s defense also turned in its best performance of the year, holding Fresno St. to just a single goal, the fewest any opponent has scored all season. Further, the 18-goal win was the team’s second-largest margin of victory (the first coming in a 24-4 win against Presbyterian on Feb. 15).
“We really played as a team,” Johansen said. “We all knew where the ball was, and every time we tried to get a goal, someone was there for backup.”
Midfielder Kara Concheck scored the only goal for the Bulldogs (2-13, 0-8 MPSF).
The Women of Troy took control of the match from the start, with USC scoring the first 11 goals of the match, including three in a 17-second span, and jumping out to a 13-1 lead at halftime. Bonomi earned her hat trick 13 minutes into the game, while Gerton, de Lyra and freshman midfielder Caroline Cordrey scored a pair of goals each in the half. Concheck’s unassisted goal with 6:18 left in the half eliminated the possibility of a shutout, but Cordrey’s two goals in the last 35 seconds of the half kept the momentum on USC’s side. The Women of Troy outshot Fresno State 18-5 in the first half, and won 12-2 on draw controls.
“On any given day, it’s just which team comes out there,”  USC head coach Lindsey Munday said. “For us, starting slow has been an Achilles’ heel of ours. Our biggest goal is making sure we play a full 60 minutes. We’ve shown we can compete at the highest level, and it’s just a matter of whether we can do it consistently.”
The Women of Troy carried their momentum into the second half, shutting out the Bulldogs and forcing them to make mistakes. Fresno State committed 21 fouls in the second half to give them 29 for the game and picked up four yellow cards. They were only able to convert on three of their seven clear attempts and didn’t pick up any draw controls.
“It was a great win today,” Munday said. “It was a team win across the board defensively, at midfield and offensively. Everyone was working together, so we’re really proud of them, but we have a big week ahead of us in terms of preparation. San Diego State is a great team, so we have a lot of work to do.”
USC outshot the Bulldogs 29-7 for the game, also winning 10-5 in ground balls and 19-2 in draw controls.
USC will play its final game of the regular season on Saturday, April 27 at 7 p.m. at San Diego State.

For the second time this season and for the first time in official Pac-12 play, the USC men’s tennis team dropped its match 4-2 against crosstown rivals UCLA on Friday at the Los Angeles Tennis Center. The match puts the Trojans at the No. 2 seed in the Pac-12 championships, to be held later this week in Ojai, Calif.
Tough day · USC sophomore Yannick Hanfmann struggled mightily against UCLA. He and junior Ray Sarmiento lost their doubles match 8-6, and Hanfmann lost his singles match 6-1, 6-1 to Adrien Puget. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The two teams appeared to improve on weaknesses from their previous meeting at Marks Stadium on Feb. 22, when the Trojans lost in a heart-wrenching tiebreak in the final singles match.
Friday’s outcome was considerably less dramatic. The Trojans started strong by picking up the doubles point behind the efforts of freshman Max de Vroome and sophomore Eric Johnson, who won their match 8-3, and sophomore Roberto Quiroz and junior Emilio Gomez, who won 8-6. Sophomore Yannick Hanfmann and junior Ray Sarmiento lost their match in the No. 1 spot 8-6.
The momentum would be short lived, however, as UCLA picked up the next four singles points to clinch the match.
Gomez was unable to replicate his success in doubles and was the first to fall. The junior, ranked No. 4 in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, was nursing a shoulder injury which severely hampered his on-court efforts. Gomez uncharacteristically missed forehands wide and looked unable to put his full strength behind his shots. He eventually retired midway through the second set trailing 6-0, 2-0.
Sophomore Eric Johnson fell next to emotionally charged UCLA junior Clay Thompson in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3. He was followed at No. 3 by fellow sophomore Yannick Hanfmann, who dropped his match to Bruin junior Adrien Puget 6-1, 6-4.
A huge upset came at the No. 1 position, where junior Ray Sarmiento squared off in a rematch against UCLA sophomore Dennis Novikov. In their last meeting, Sarmiento punished the less-mobile Novikov by neutralizing the Bruin’s strong forehands and serves with deep slices and surgically precise groundstrokes.
In Friday’s rematch, however, Sarmiento was unable to employ the same strategy. Novikov’s first serve, which was erratic in their last meeting, was devastatingly accurate, leading to a number of service aces.
Novikov’s lack of mobility never came under scrutiny. The sophomore almost seemed stationary through some points while launching his booming groundstrokes from the center, and instead it was Sarmiento who was on the run trying to chase down shots. Sarmiento’s 6-4, 6-2 loss would ultimately seal the Trojans’ fate in the match.
There was still tennis to be played, however, and sophomore Jonny Wang was down in his second set when the scoreboard adjacent to his court displayed the determined outcome of the overall team match.
“It’s disappointing,” Wang said on seeing the team’s result midway through his match. “But you have to put that aside and focus on your own match and give it your all.”
Wang fought on valiantly, dispatching UCLA’s redshirt freshman Karue Sell by forcing the unorthodox Sell to his weaker forehand and exploiting Sell’s ineffectual positioning by hitting numerous deep, uncontested winners.
While on the court, Wang was his usual energetic self. But off the court, his trademark ebullience was almost immediately muted by the team’s result.
“I would have gladly lost my [personal] match if it meant the team could win the match,” Wang said.
Wang’s teammate Quiroz adapted a similar temporary oblivion to the team match score during his match against Bruin sophomore Dennis Mkrtchian. Despite dropping the first set, Quiroz would roar back and claim the second set, then dismantle Mkrtchian in tiebreaks with screaming flat forehands for a final score of 5-7, 6-3, 1-0 (10-4).
Barring a monumental upset on either side of the bracket, the Bruins and Trojans will most likely meet once again in the Pac-12 championship final this weekend.
UCLA and USC, by virtue of being the No. 1 and No. 2 seed, respectively, also enjoy a first-round bye and advance automatically to the semifinal round. All eyes will be on Gomez’s shoulder and de Vroome’s wrist this week, with the hopes that the players will return to form in time for postseason play.
The Trojans won the double point plus two single matches to give them three points for a final score of
3 – 4 not your math of 4 – 2. It was a disappointing loss once again to the ‘ruins. Smith is not such a great
coach without Steve Johnson to have his back in the tough matches.

In light of the recent Boston Marathon tragedy, a lot of attention has been focused on the effect of how media — specifically, television news and scripted shows — conveys breaking news to the public.
Despite past breaking news mistakes (CNN’s and Fox News’ coverage on the 2012 Supreme Court health care decision, anyone?), reporters still seem focused primarily on getting the stories out immediately. And in a fascinating, compulsory manner, television reporters still seem to play down the importance of accuracy and reliable facts.
Television coverage regarding Boston, the marathon, the explosions and the suspects was often put out in such a hurry to crank out an eye-opening angle that the stories were incorrect and inefficient.
According to the Entertainment Weekly article “How TV covered the Boston manhunt,” by Melissa Maerz, news was broken and quickly retracted during the entire day of the bombings.
The article pointed to just a few instances in which TV falsely portrayed the events. At one point, for example, it was reported that the primary suspects, Dzhokar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, had robbed a store, but then later it was reported that it was actually not the Tsarnaevs and that the event was completely unrelated.
“The longer the networks reported on the Boston manhunt on Friday afternoon, the less we knew about what was actually going on,” she said.
Another interesting point that was brought up is that because of the inaccuracy of the local news and TV reports, onlookers often looked to social media sites for information.
“You got the feeling that watching TV was no better than following ordinary people on Twitter or Reddit,” Maerz said.
In her article, Maerz said that the situation has “raised some troubling questions about the power of TV news in general.” Does Maerz have a point? In this rush to be the first to publish, has television news coverage become a harmful and inefficient source for receiving information about tragedies?
The problem of broadcasting tragedies on TV does not stop at depictions via news coverage. Rather, television shows have increasingly decided to cover topics of tragedy that Americans still might feel uncomfortable with.
In the April 11 episode of Glee, gunshots are heard during glee practice. After much craziness, it is discovered that Becky Jackson, who has Down Syndrome, was terrified by her pending graduation and was the culprit behind the gunshots.
Consequently, Sue Sylvester, who is usually every episode’s villain, takes the blame for Becky. Though this episode does dramatize the fear and tragedy of an event like a school shooting, it inevitably imposes an unrealistic and happier conclusion, which is inconsistent with authentic, disastrous effects.
Just as news media can be guilty of sensationalizing news, scripted television seems to be guilty at times of sugarcoating it. There should be a middle ground.
Though there is no easy way to resolve the challenge of reporting correct information on breaking TV news and properly portraying tragic events in fictional television, it remains necessary to ensure objective, factual coverage.
Whether the solution lies in journalists finding a better balance between accuracy and the speed of a story’s delivery or in TV producers better thinking through depictions in fictional TV, it is clear that something needs to be done.
IT’s not just the context itself, either — it’s how much. In an article in the Oakland Press, Megan Semeraz quotes a clinical analyst and lead trauma expert, Jasmin White, saying that one of the most important ways to deal with nonstop news coverage of tragic events is to limit time spent with media.
“Those who watch the most coverage have the most substantial stress reactions,” White said. “One of the important things is limit the amount of coverage, don’t watch before bed time …  and talk to each other.”
And in an article from the Boston Herald, former ABC News President David Westin noted that TV coverage has the potential to exacerbate problems.
“The television coverage itself can become an instrument of terror if you’re not careful,” he said.
Going back to the current situation in Boston, Westin pointed out that television reporting has become more than just covering facts.
“What happened in Boston is a tragically ideal example of how we get our information these days,” Westin said.
It is necessary to acknowledge TV’s relationship with its audience. Whether it is covering breaking news or using a television show to discuss current events, television is a medium that has the power to shape the collective perception of an event. Because of this, television has the responsibility to present the facts in the most objective way possible so that viewers can form their own opinions.

After the creative mind behind the newly revamped Altadena farmer’s market, Joseph Shuldiner, was brought on as a consultant for the Grand Central Market, it was clear things were going to change at the historic bazaar.
Honest ingredients · One of the options at Sticky Rice is gai yang, a Thai grilled chicken dish. A little lime and cilantro gives the dish a kick. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
And the revamp has already started. USC alumnus and restaurateur David Tewasart (Soi 7, Spirit House)  joins chef Johnny Lee (Flying Pig Truck, Rivera) to be a part of the first wave of new vendors to hit the stalls with their Thai food stand, Sticky Rice.
Shuldiner and Director of Business Development Christophe Farber wanted to bring a more modern culinary direction to the market, and Tewasart’s Sticky Rice certainly answers the call.
The concept behind the menu at Sticky Rice is simple — Tewasart refers to it as “Thai kitchen-style dining.” It’s the type of meal that kitchen staff would cook for themselves during downtimes, a type of food which is substantive enough to satisfy the physical rigors of back-of-the-house work yet light enough to keep the staff alert through long dinner shifts.
“A lot of street vendors in Thailand serve this type of food,” Tewasart said. “We’re just trying to simplify things.”
Tewasart has done just that: The menu at Sticky Rice currently boasts three options. The first is gai yang, or Thai-style barbecue chicken, served with som tum and sticky rice. The second offering is a Thai take on Hainan chicken, a steamed chicken dish served with garlic rice and chicken soup. Finally, Tewasart rounds out the menu with a beef panang curry served with coconut rice. All of the above are foods that Tewasart ate growing up — with an added twist:
“We use organic meats [and] free-range chickens,” Tewasart said. “We’re not trying to reinvent Thai food, we’re just trying to upgrade the ingredients and the quality.”
This commitment to better ingredients seldom fleshes out in such remarkable ways as Tewasart and Lee have done in their four-week soft open of the Grand Central Market. On one visit, a clean-tasting grilled barbecue chicken is unobtrusive yet savory, highlighting a marinade that positively blossoms with fragrant notes of turmeric and lime juice.
“I think everyone is searching for new flavors. Thai food itself is not exotic anymore — I notice a lot of the popular restaurants in New York, Portland or here in L.A. are doing different kinds of Thai food that represent different regions of Thailand, not just your typical pad thai and satay, which we probably won’t serve,” Tewasart said.
Sticky Rice’s primary focus — and greatest asset — is its execution of balance and restraint in flavor. Som tum at any other Thai restaurant in Los Angeles or Hollywood’s Thai Town is often a tedious exercise in managing the screaming heat of Thai chili. There’s no such drama to be had at Sticky Rice, where the thinly julienned green papaya is vibrant and tangy on the palate, followed by a snarky kick in the finish that lingers just longer than a moment.
Notably, when conceiving Sticky Rice’s menu, Tewasart wanted to eschew the extremes of oft-stereotyped Thai cuisine, including the overbearing heft of cliche, greasy noodle dishes.
This approach renders obsolete a staple of the Thai kitchen, the wok, which is something Tewasart insists the restaurant will not need.
All of Sticky Rice’s food tastes clean and steers clear of grease and MSG, including the beef panang curry. Lee braises cubes of beef in the curry base, coconut milk, kaffir lime, garlic and lemongrass, but the product lacks the usual film of oil that materializes toward the surface — something Lee explained was a result of cooling down the curry and skimming the residual grease during preparation. The extra step yields a noticeably more nuanced rendition of the homey Thai favorite, which Lee would be fully justified in charging twice the price of its $6 tag.
This leads to another point: Sticky Rice’s entrees are $9. The accessible price point is a statement that healthy, flavorful and expertly prepared food doesn’t necessarily have to be expensive. Tewasart insists this is Thai food for everyone, including students.
“There’s a lot of foodies in [this] generation of university students. We’re seeing more sophisticated palates with this younger group of students and professionals,” Tewasart said.
This generation is sophisticated enough, at least, to know the difference between sound execution of simple concepts and garish, overwrought food pageantry.
At a time where restaurants are constantly pushing the envelope with esoteric combinations of flavors in an effort to woo potential diners (galbi beef dumplings with “spicy Seoul slaw” for lunch? Really, Lazy Ox Canteen?), it’s refreshing to see an approach such as Tewasart’s Sticky Rice. Everything is lean and simple, yet substantive, satisfying and honest. This lithe, back-to-basics approach strikes the perfect balance of cultural authenticity, culinary sophistication and lunch friendliness for the revamped Grand Central Market.

The fast pace of everyday life often leaves little time for bigger-picture problems; social justice issues are overshadowed by material desires, and environmental problems are sidelined by the stress of thousand-word essays.
But it’s crucial to pause and evaluate the world around us, and to come together and see the footprints we leave. And this sunny week in April, USC students will have the chance to do just that.
Undergraduate Student Government, Program Board and USC’s USC Office of Sustainability have collaborated to bring USC its third-annual Earth Week. Beginning April 21, the USC community will heighten its environmental awareness through workshops, speakers and outdoor activities held throughout the week.
Justin Bogda, assistant director of the USC Political Assembly, organized this year’s Earth Week.
“There are a lot of incredibly potent environmental issues all around the world and all of that is a result of our doing in America,” Bogda said. “We want people to become more aware of that through Earth Week.”
Organizers have taken ideas scrawled onto sticky notes and whiteboards and transformed them into tangible instances. A steady stream of students have updated their Facebook cover photos and profile pictures to Earth Week graphics or comical photographs of them hugging trees in order to promote events. The blueprint for each day demonstrates the variety of organizations involved: Organizations from the USC Bedrosian Center for Governance to the USC Fashion Industry Association will chip in for this year’s events.
Though Earth Week is a 21st-century creation, it gains its roots from Earth Day. Tracing back to 1970 — a true hippie era — Earth Day is celebrated by more than 192 countries annually. Earth Day occurs every year on April 22, which was created to increase awareness of global environmental issues.
Campus leaders have lined up events such as a fashion show and bike tours of Los Angeles. Incentives for attendees include free milkshakes, food and giveaways. Several student groups will also set up shop on McCarthy Quad during Earth Week’s pinnacle event on Thursday, the Advocacy Fair.
Students who give environmentally friendly organizations their time on Thursday will earn treats such as fresh produce. A DJ from KXSC, a Brazilian drum performance and a laser light show will serve as entertainment for participants in the evening.
Bogda, a junior majoring in environmental sciences and international relations, wanted to be clear that he had a lot of help re-shaping Earth Week’s structural activities.
“But by no means am I the only person carrying out this endeavor,” he said. Bogda credits the Sustainability Business Leadership Council and members of various environmental programs on campus for their help.
At the culmination of Earth Week, contributors will also present three resolutions to the university administration in order to reform campus policies. The first resolution urges the university to eliminate paper receipts, since many students toss them aside anyway. Organizers also request reform in the current recycling policy to foster a more eco-friendly environment. In the final resolution, groups have proposed a campaign for divestment from fossil-fuel companies.
Ivan Kumamoto, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he was looking forward to the different speakers.
“I’m most excited to see Surfrider founding President Rob Caughlan speak,” Kumamoto said. “He’s been in the environmental movement for years and knows a lot about why it’s important to protect our oceans, so listening to what he has to say will be great.”
Kumamoto said that the message behind Earth week resonates with him.
“I hope that my peers are inspired by the green movement and Earth Week; I hope they see that it’s a worthwhile cause.”
But students shouldn’t withhold their devotion to worldly issues after Earth Week. In fact, Bogda and his council envision an Earth Month in the future.
“The next step to getting students to care is to get them involved directly in community projects,” Bogda said. “Little do people know that there is an urban garden on Shrine Place that they could contribute to. There are so many little things around here we can start with to make a difference.”
So grab a friend and take note of the plans in store for USC this week. You won’t regret lending a hand to a planet that makes everything possible.

The importance of volunteerism
As one of the leading universities in the country, USC should make volunteerism a requirement for graduation and aim to focus its resources on promoting volunteerism on campus if it wants its students to have a greater impact on the world.
College is the time to explore your interests and to try different things that you may have never considered before. The number of opportunities that are opened to us once we step onto these grounds are endless. Among them are volunteering opportunities that take place in locations ranging from just a couple blocks from campus to thousands of miles away in third-world countries.
Students are more concerned about studying, socializing and worrying about their future careers instead of giving back to communities at home and abroad. Society plays a role in promoting this success-driven mentality, but the USC community is to blame as well.
The trustees have the most influence in the direction and focus of the students. Requiring students to complete a minimum number of hours volunteering and giving back to a community would decentralize our one-directional minds, at least for those few hours, benefitting both ourselves and surrounding communities.
It is true that time that is spent volunteering can be spent studying, drafting resumes and cover letters, applying for internships and jobs or socializing and having fun; after all, we only have this kind of freedom for what seems like a millisecond before we’re tossed into the great unknown of responsibilities and nine-to-five jobs.
However, volunteering can be a great bonding experience for us and an easy way to meet others from different social and academic backgrounds within the USC community.
Furthermore, students could make connections with community leaders in public service and with other volunteers that may help them later in their careers or life. Volunteering also allows us to try out new careers without making long-term commitments and it allows us to gain experience in a new field. The benefits will eventually surface in the least likely of places. Volunteering allows us to work in groups, learn from one another and exercise our creativity throughout the entire process.
Whether it is helping raise money for a special cause or tutoring students in the neighboring communities, volunteering can help us build skills that will be helpful for our future careers. It’s not a completely far-fetched idea for USC to make volunteerism a requirement for graduation after realizing the benefits, both for us and society.

While I agree with some of the other comments that volunteering should be voluntary, I commend the author for bringing volunteerism to the forefront of discussion, challenging the trustees to uphold its value, and highlighting its benefits. I remember back when I was touring the campus, there was one thing that was loud and clear: USC was the Time’s College of the Year in 2000. Why? It wasn’t because of academics, resources, or even their football team, it was because the students and staff were committed to volunteering, community outreach and being a good neighbor. I also wouldn’t be surprised if the transformation of the South LA community from the riots in the early 90s to what it is today (not the greatest, but not nearly as bad as I heard it once was) is largely due to USC’s commitment to the surrounding community.
Though I’m not sure what the results (positive or negative) would be for a volunteer requirement for graduation, there are ways that the trustees and administration can highlight the value of volunteering or offer incentives for students to consider volunteering as a worthy avenue of their time.
The whole point of volunteering is that it is voluntary. It is a great thing, but the whole point of it is completed defeated if it is required.
Volunteering is one of the most rewarding experiences in life. When you have the ability to give back to others, not only improving the quality of their lives but you are setting an example for everyone around you.
Unfortunately, not everyone has the ability or privilege to volunteer their time (though I believe that most people probably would like to if they could).
Many high schools require students to complete community service hours as part of their requirements to graduate. This can be beneficial in many cases, but often creates a sense of resentfulness towards volunteering because it is being prescribed as opposed to something out of the goodness of one’s heart.
I personally agree with you that volunteering is important and that people should take efforts to improve their communities. But you take it a step too far by advocating for a university wide mandate that students do so. We’re in college. We’re all adults. We don’t need to be told what to do with our weekends or our free time. Volunteering is great and people should do more of it, but its not your job, mine, or the University’s place to tell people what to do with their lives. If people want to spend all of their time “socializing” or “worrying about their future careers” they have every right to do so. This is a free country.

Last Wednesday, a bipartisan group of leaders known as the “Gang of Eight” unveiled an 844-page bill that supporters argue, if passed, will offer a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. This document, created after months of intense negotiation at the prompting of the president, is a promising sign that the United States is ready to embrace the immigration reform it has needed for so long.
The unveiling of this bill, however, has been masked by the tragic events that occurred last week in Boston. The bombing of the Boston Marathon has prompted some politicians to voice their concerns at the prospects of changing current immigration practices.

After the two suspects had been identified, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa voiced his concerns on Friday during a hearing on immigration legislation.
“Given the events of this week, it’s important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system,” he said. “While we don’t yet know the immigration status of people who have terrorized the communities in Massachusetts, when we find out, it will help shed light on the weaknesses of our system.”
And Alex Conant, a spokesperson for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, stated in an email to the Christian Science Monitor that “there are legitimate policy questions to ask and answer about what role our immigration system played, if any, in what happened.”
Grassley and Conant’s concerns are entirely understandable. The events that transpired in Boston last week have made the American consciousness uneasy.
But in his statement, Conant also affirmed that the well-being of peaceful and hardworking immigrants who are in our country right now needs to be considered, too.
“Americans will reject any attempt to tie the terrorists responsible for the attacks in Boston with the millions of decent, law-abiding immigrants currently living in the U.S and those hoping to immigrate here in the future,” Conant said.
Those who oppose the bill are often quite blind to what an asset immigrants are to the United States. Indeed, the United States is a nation of immigrants and it is a fact that a large proportion of the people reading this article right now are descended from people who voluntarily chose to immigrate to the United States.
Immigration allows for a greater diversity and meshing of culture, which, in turn, provides for a fluid field of ideas and beliefs that allows Americans to learn about various aspects of life. In addition to being a defining American characteristic, cultural diversity brings about new forms of social growth and interaction.
But the benefits of immigration go beyond just diversity. In terms of economics, immigrants in the United States are more likely to start a business on American soil than American-born citizens are.
A study conducted for the Small Business Administration by Robert W. Fairlie, a professor of economics at UC Santa Cruz and a research adjunct at the RAND Corporation, found that the rate of small-business ownership among foreign-born citizens is 12.5 percent. By comparison, the U.S.-born rate is 9.3 percent.
That same study also found that immigrants are 30 percent more likely to start a small business than U.S.-born citizens and that these businesses are met with a roughly equal success rate as that of nonimmigrant businesses.
Immigrants are a key driver of innovation in the United States, too. According to statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, immigrants comprise “33 percent of engineers, 27 percent of mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists, and 24 percent of physical scientists,” despite only making up 16 percent of the American population,
Immigration to the United States is an unstoppable force and will continue legally and illegally regardless of how Congress votes on the reform bill. Critics must consider this when considering whether or not to support the reform.
But after examining all of the facts, it becomes clear that the only reasonable way to talk about the immigration reform bill, regardless of political beliefs, is with support.
