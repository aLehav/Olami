Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry announced that he will leave USC next year to become Vice President for Students at the University of British Columbia. In a campuswide email on Tuesday, Carry said he will stay until next April to prepare the position for his successor.
“I have nothing but gratitude for my USC experience,” Carry said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I have worked with some of the best professionals in their fields, both inside the division of student affairs and outside the division of student affairs. … It’s been a top notch experience for me to be a part of what it’s like to strive to be No. 1 in the world in whatever we do.”
Carry came to USC from Auburn University in 2013. Over the past few years, he worked in residential education, student health, greek life and equity and inclusion among other departments at USC.
“I want to personally thank Dr. Carry for his support for our students,” Provost Michael Quick wrote in an email to the USC community. “He has brought a thoughtful approach to ensuring our students develop and thrive as they balance their academic pursuits with engaging campus activities. Our students appreciate his respect and attention, as well as his good humor and high energy. They know he cares deeply for their wellbeing.”
Despite the internal turmoil the University administration has faced in recent years, Carry said that his time at USC has been memorable.
“Even the ups and downs have been good experiences because people have been committed, even when we fall short and learn about our shortcomings,” he said. “I’ve worked with people who are committed to getting it right, to going into the right direction, to working hard to improve. … For me, it’s all about feedback.” 
Carry plans to oversee a greater number of departments at UBC. In addition to the departments he is currently responsible for, he will manage public safety, athletics and dining.
In his email, Quick wrote that he will consider faculty, staff and student input as USC searches for Carry’s successor.

James Ellis will leave his role as dean of the Marshall School of Business at the end of the fiscal year, according to a letter from Interim President Wanda Austin. The decision to terminate Ellis was brought up in a meeting held by Austin and General Counsel Carol Mauch Amir on Friday.
In an email to Marshall faculty, Ellis said that the decision was reached from a cumulative record of complaints registered since 2009 at the USC Office of Equity and Diversity cases made against the Marshall staff, rather than any actions he had done. He noted that a majority of the cases were never brought to his attention. 
“Nevertheless, this apparently has led University leadership to believe that we do not have a positive culture here,” Ellis wrote in the email, which was obtained by the Daily Trojan. “Therefore, they feel a change of leadership is in order.”
According to the email, the Marshall Faculty Council asked for a meeting with Austin in response to the decision, and external stakeholders brought up concerns about “process, transparency and reputational damage.”
Lloyd Greif, benefactor of the USC Marshall Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, said the “rash” decision to terminate Ellis will cut his appointment short by three years. He said the decision is detrimental to the school’s reputation. 
“[Ellis] is a decent and honorable man who doesn’t have a racist or sexist bone in his body,” Greif wrote in a letter to the Marshall Board of Leaders and USC Leventhal School of Accounting Board of Advisors. “This dean bears no resemblance whatsoever to the deans who have fallen before him — Puliafito (substance abuse), Varma (sexual harassment), and Flynn (questionable ethics and potential criminality).”  
Citing Ellis’ accomplishments as dean since 2007, Greif said Ellis was notified of 10 percent of the complaints registered with OED that were in need of further review — all of which he investigated and resolved. The Daily Trojan could not independently confirm this statement.
“Jim Ellis is part of the solution to what ails USC, not part of the problem,” he wrote. “This is not my opinion — this is fact.”
Greif said that he disagrees with Austin’s decision to remove Ellis from the deanship, a move that has been opposed by a some Board of Trustees members. But according to the letter, Chairman Rick Caruso said, “Wanda, as the University’s President, is empowered to make employment decisions, not the Board.”
“Since when is an Interim President given the same unfettered power to make personnel decisions as a permanent President who is selected by a Search Committee after a nationwide search and given a five-year mandate to steer the University?” Greif wrote. “Wanda is, in effect, a lame duck president.”
Dean James Ellis did not respond in time for publication. The story will be updated with his comments.
