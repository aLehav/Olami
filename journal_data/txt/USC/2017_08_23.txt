The University’s facilities will be used to host athletics and house media during the 2028 Summer Olympic Games.
This will be the third time the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum hosts an Olympic event since the 1932 and 1984 Olympics. To save the city of Los Angeles billions in construction costs, the LA 2024 bid — which was consequently revised to the year 2028 — will house journalists and members of the media at the USC Village, the location of the official Media Village. 
Meanwhile, Pauley Pavilion and the Hill at UCLA will serve as the Olympic Village — the housing destination for athletes. 
In addition to the Media Village, journalists will also be able to utilize the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s state-of-the-art media center on campus while they cover the event. 
Athletics, including track and field, are proposed to take place at the Coliseum while aquatics will be on campus and badminton will take place at the Galen Center.
Students who are enrolled in summer courses will be housed in other areas of the University to accommodate the influx of media during that time, according to Daniel Stimmler, USC Vice President of Auxiliary Services and Chief Operating Officer of L.A. Memorial Coliseum.
“We think it’s going to create an amazing opportunity for students leading up to [the Olympics] to be involved with the Games in a way they never have before,” Stimmler said, “[This includes] not just volunteering — I would anticipate classes focused on the economic impact of Olympics to a city [like Los Angeles].”
The International Olympics Committee reportedly made $180 million in advanced payments to the Los Angeles Organizing Committee in preparation for the event. 
In its plans to utilize the STAPLES Center, Pauley Pavilion at UCLA and the Coliseum, the city will avoid spending money on new arenas. The deal closed with economic expectations of hundreds of millions in cost reduction and revenue. If the city is able to stay under the $487 million budget, city officials struck a deal for L.A. to keep most of the remaining money.
The deal broke after weeks of negotiations between Los Angeles and Paris, with Paris decidedly hosting 2024 and Los Angeles hosting 2028. Plans to accommodate the logistics of hosting the massive event have begun among USC administrators and city officials.  
“These villages are clearly the best choice for athletes and the media. These are also the best choice for the people of Los Angeles,” said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, an avid campaigner for the L.A. Olympic event, in a press conference in July.
Renovations for the Coliseum, which include a new track instillation, begin Jan. 2018, despite the announcement of L.A.’s decision to host the Olympic games.
The IOC’s formal vote in favor of Los Angeles hosting the event is set to take place Sept. 2017.

With the opening of the USC Village this fall, students were treated to new commercial spaces, a Hogwarts-style dining hall and increased housing opportunities. 
For URB-E CEO Peter Lee, who just opened his second company location in the Village, it is a chance to reconnect with the school that set him on the path of innovation. Now, he seeks to inspire entrepreneurs and students to pursue their ideas through his success.
URB-E is a cross between a bike and a car — a vehicle design Lee hoped would cut travel time and eliminate the need for parking.
Lee graduated from the Marshall School of Business in 2009, earning his MBA through IBEAR, a one-year intensive program designed for mid-career professionals with a global business mindset.
As a native Californian, his experience in the L.A. area, with its traffic congestion and lack of parking, inspired him to found URB-E in 2014. 
“As a student here, I had to pay for parking, which was a lot of money, but that didn’t necessarily mean that I got a parking space,” Lee said. “I spent a lot of time looking for parking,  a lot of money paying for parking tickets, and when I had to go a micro-mile or short distance … it would take me 20 to 30 minutes to do that trip.” 
When Lee was a student, time was something he never seemed to have enough of, as he struggled to fit in studying, hanging out with friends and getting involved with extracurricular activities.
“At USC, [time and opportunity] were two very valuable things that were invaluable [to me],” Lee said. “I couldn’t pay enough money for them.”
Because of that, Lee felt like he needed to put more time back into his day, while seeking to alleviate the parking and traffic problems around him. USC’s business program fostered the right environment for Lee to tackle these issues with innovation, an idea that he set into motion years later through his company.
“At USC, you really learn to push the limits of what is possible not only business-wise or academic-wise, but also in relationships, innovation and thinking outside the box,” Lee said. “This is what USC is all about.” 
Lee set up URB-E operations in Pasadena, a location close enough to L.A. to help him focus on and understand urban traffic issues.
While continuing to build his company, Lee found that the greatest obstacle to his business’ growth was his ability to spread the word about URB-E and convince people to try the gadget. 
“Part of being an entrepreneur, inventor and innovator is not settling for the status quo,” Lee said. “[It’s about] challenging the status quo, not only within yourself, but within your community to provide a better solution people will adopt.” 
With URB-E’s location in the Village, Lee hopes to serve as an inspiration to USC students who aspire to challenge the status quo through innovation. 
For Lee, being a member of the Trojan family means having roots in an institution with a student body focused on changing the world. Lee looks to the next generation of Trojans to solve issues like congestion in cities.
The new location at the Village is more than a tribute to his alma mater, Lee said, but a launching pad for future innovators. He aims to provide student innovators with the resources he wanted most when he was a student — time and opportunity — through an URB-E vehicle.
“That’s why we attend USC and why we’re so happy when we graduate — to … become part of this Trojan family,” Lee said. “It is because of the opportunities it affords us. We’re here for four years, [and] every second is super valuable.”

The USC Keck School of Medicine of USC is looking to find breakthroughs in understanding multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that disproportionately affects minority groups. Dr. Lilyana Amezcua of the Keck School is leading a research team to increase a scarce database of information concerning the Hispanic population that has long been neglected in scientific literature. 
Amezcua said she wants to ensure that the Hispanic population, the minority group most likely to be diagnosed with MS, according to her, will not be ignored as they have been in years past. 
“[Hispanics] have been … ignored or neglected in the literature [compared to other ethnicities],” Amezcua said.  “But, here we have the opportunity to learn about them so we can treat them as a group.” 
MS is an acquired disease of the central nervous system which affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. While its cause is unknown, there have been significant discoveries regarding the pathological path of the disease. 
Amezcua’s interest in MS was sparked in 2006 during her fellowship at USC, where she was splitting her time between helping to treat patients in a public and private clinic. 
“Going back and forth between those two clinics, I could tell that there were differences,” Amezua said. “When you would go to LA County, the diversity was greater … I was serving certain characteristics of the disease that I could not explain. 
After finding only 1 percent of scientific literature was dedicated to minorities diagnosed with MS, Amezcua was driven her to conduct the research herself.  
After gathering over 500 blood samples from Hispanic-Americans in the USC community, Amezcua realized she needed a greater sample size to draw any scientific conclusions. So she founded the Alliance for Research in Hispanic MS through a partnership with University of California, San Francisco and the University of Miami. Currently, the Alliance has gathered over 5,000 sample data. 
With the preliminary data, the researchers then hypothesized there were external, environmental factors that could influence the severeness of the disease. 
“US-born Hispanics tend to get MS at a much younger age compared to whites and compared within other Hispanic groups,” Amezcua said.  “We don’t know why, but that is telling us there is likely an environmental factor more prevalent here.”
The team wanted to be the first to conduct a longitudinal study, one that examined not only genetic background of diagnosed patients, but also trace their life to find possible environmental factors that triggered their disease. 
“Of course we wanted to go forward,” Amezua said. “About last year, I wrote this proposal that said we have enough preliminary data … but we want to know a little bit more.” 
Amezcua and the rest of the research team launched a study in August where the team will follow 400 Hispanics who have been diagnosed with MS in the last two years, aiming to disentangle the genetic disease factors from the nongenetic factors. The project is being funded by a grant from the The National Multiple Sclerosis Society. 
“It’s a very interesting study because it is work that really hasn’t been done before, trying to get a better understanding of how MS manifests itself in Hispanic populations, looking at genetics but also looking at acculturation,” said Dr. Nicholas LaRocca, the society’s associate vice president of health care delivery and policy research. 
The School of Cinematic Arts also collaborated with the project to develop a video for patients diagnosed with MS. While the video is not yet available to the public, Amezcua hopes it will be used as a tool nationally to inform patients of the symptoms. 
“We’re trying to use that film as a tool to provide us more information as we explore some of those social cultural factors,” Amezcua said.

Three years ago, Larisa Rus had an idea. 
Her parents kept bees as a hobby, and Rus says that at one point her family had so much honey, they didn’t know what to do with it. 
“I said to them, ‘What if I create a brand that speaks to that to try to create awareness of [bee-related] issues?’” Rus said.
Today, she is the founder and owner of her family-run business Bee Green Honey, a staple at the weekly Trojan Farmers Market since she started the company in 2014. 
Since then, Rus has also participated in the Larchmont and Bank of America farmers markets. 
“It’s like a home here,” Rus said. “We enjoy our customers, our regulars. We’re going to keep coming here as long as we have this honey.”
Through Bee Green Honey, Rus focuses on sustainability as well as giving back to the bees and the environment. She does so by paying customers a dollar for every jar they return after using all of the honey and speaking with students about current issues regarding bees when they stop by the table.
“I’m surprised that a lot of students are aware of what’s happening with bees,” Rus said. “They seem to know about bee collapse disorder and the declining bee population. We try to answer many questions [and] give knowledge about bees and what it takes for the bees to produce honey.”
Rus also explained that her brand’s flavored honey is 100 percent natural. 
“Different flavors are [from] different farms that have different crops,” Rus said. “[People] think you add an essence or something in it [but] in fact, it is the bee pollinating the orange blossom tree or the raspberry patch or alfalfa fields.”
To create different flavors, the family members arrange to take their hives to the farms of different crops for the bees to pollinate. Alfalfa and orange blossom flavors are normally available year-round, while sunflower and raspberry tend to be seasonal.
“We are a smaller operation, so when we run out of honey we won’t always sell the same flavors,” Rus said. “The sunflower and the raspberry we don’t always have and when we don’t have them, everybody’s emailing, ‘When [are] you going to have it back?’”
The honey is extracted from the hives two to three times a year, usually in April and October. To withdraw the honey, Rus and her family check on frames from inside of the honey extraction machine and evaluate which frames are ready to be removed based on how full they are. The extricated honey is finally placed in the labeled bottles, leaving it completely natural.
Rus says she is careful that the bees are treated well. She makes sure that they are taken to organic farms for pollination to avoid pesticides and other harmful substances and ensures that during the extraction of the honey some is left for the bees to survive over the winter.
In addition to balancing her business, Rus also works a full-time job at an architecture firm.
“We try to do as much as we can,” Rus said. “My parents are the ones who actually go and do all the farming work and I go and help with extracting, bottling and the labels. My uncle and my aunt usually do the markets.”
Rus hopes to continue selling at farmers markets rather than opening a store.
“[A store] requires more honey to be processed and you have to make a lot more honey that I’m not sure is going to be as pure and as good,” Rus said. “We’re trying to avoid that because we believe in the extraction part, bottling it ourselves and knowing what goes in there.”
Over her years in the business, Rus has developed friendly relationships with members of the USC community. 
“This is one market we’ve kept for three years continuously,” Rus said. “We kind of made a good customer base mixed with students, faculty and administrators.”

Possessed by a love for Los Angeles, musician Justin Chart embarked on a mission to create a definitive anthem for his native city — one worthy of the beauty and vibrancy he saw. Thus, after its conception and over 11 million YouTube views later, “Los Angeles the Song” has become a tribute that will withstand the test of time. 
Accompanied by picturesque shots of the city’s beaches and a twangy guitar intro, Chart’s song erupts into a hymn of admiration for Los Angeles, “We are a winning team. Stars and the silver screen. We come from near and far. To be with the best. We’re Los Angeles. Los Angeles.”
Since the record’s release  in 2012, Chart has created six more versions of the song, each accompanied by unique music videos featuring a wide array of musicians: “Los Angeles La Cancion,” “Los Angeles Dance Angeles,” Los Angeles Latin,” “Los Angeles Word,” “Los Angeles Voice of The World” and “Los Angeles A City Alive.” 
In “Los Angeles Voice of The World,” Chart performs alongside 40 singers and three rappers hailing from all of Los Angeles’ 25 sister cities and three friendship cities around the globe. The cast sings in 28 different languages spanning six continents, spurring cross-cultural friendships and strengthening the city’s global relationships. 
People who have heard the song — Angeleno or not — are moved by the powerful, positive message of the song and Chart’s irrefutable love for his city. 
“I get comments from all over the world who see this video who see the video and think, ‘I want to come to L.A.,” Chart said. “I don’t show the darker side of L.A.; I don’t show gangs or any of that. I’m trying to pump up an uplifting image of Los Angeles.”
Chart, a singer-songwriter and music producer by trade, was born in Los Angeles to a musical family. Growing up, he played the piano, clarinet and saxophone and went on to study music at The School of Performing Arts in London.
Since its release, “Los Angeles the Song” has garnered widespread public praise and received numerous awards from high-ranking officials. L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti presented Chart with an Artisan Appreciation Award in July 2014 and lauded his ability to capture “through song for people to enjoy and understand this passion for the city we all call home.” 
Chart has also been recognized by City Council President Herb Wesson, Councilmen Jose Huizar, Tom La Bonge and Gil Cedillo. In February 2016, he was flown out to Washington, D.C. to receive a Statement of Accomplishment from U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein. Most recently, the city council adopted his composition  as an official part of Los Angeles’ history in May 2017. 
“It’s been a great road and I’ve had a lot of people who have been very positive about [what I’m doing],” Chart said. “I’m going to continue on and make this song a part of our city.” 
Currently, Chart is partnering with music director Tony Wilkins to produce “Los Angeles The Vision,” a new project that will consolidate some of the most powerful voices in Los Angeles in a unified message of pride, power and passion for the city. 
With a total of 300 voices present, the song will feature three local gospel choirs from the First American Methodist Episcopal Church, the Los Angeles Mass Choir and West Angeles Church. “Los Angeles The Vision” will mark the seventh distinct version of Chart’s song and is set for release in time for the holiday season. 
In the long term, Chart envisions a version of the song that will welcome global patrons at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. 
To him, the recognition and positive support he has received mean more than money ever could. 
“I’m doing this because I’m a native and I love the city and I want to do something good,” Chart said.

In recent years, millennials have been blamed for ruining a number of businesses and industries. The cereal industry, Buffalo Wild Wings and the entire paper napkin business are only a few examples of the victims on Generation Y’s alleged hit list. 
Despite the industries that millennials are apparently destroying, it appears these individuals are also responsible for revitalizing others — in particular, the vinyl record industry. 
The Economist reported in 2016 that vinyl sales the previous year had the largest gross profit since 1988, a whopping $416 million. In addition, the best-selling audio device of that year, not including the iPhone, was the turntable. 
A report by The Guardian said that 2017 is the ninth consecutive year vinyl sales have gone up. 
A rise in sales has been credited to more widespread exposure, coming not only from national events such as Record Store Day, but also from more places beginning to accumulate and sell vinyl records.
Another key factor in the rise of vinyl sales, as suggested by The Guardian, has been the deaths of legendary musicians. People have been flocking to buy records, especially after the passings of icons, because the records of such artists become keepsakes. The most recent example of this phenomena was David Bowie. Following his death, he became the best-selling vinyl artist of 2016.
“Young people still want something tangible and real. Vinyl is taking on the role that the CD used to have,” Vanessa Higgins, the CEO of Regent Street and Gold Bar Records, told The Guardian,
She also pointed out how an increase in streaming and digital downloads has encouraged the discovery of more music, thus spurring a desire to own a physical copy. 
The idea of having tangible and real music is also why De’Lon Warren, a senior majoring in animation and digital arts, believes more millennials are buying records. 
“They buy them for the same reasons why people like [low-fidelity] hip-hop,” Warren said. “The imperfections. It’s what makes the sound relatable and more human. Vinyls feel more authentic. With all the processed sounding, mainstream music out today, it’s a nice break.”
The recent influx of millennial attention could also be linked to the rise in millennial-targeted sellers, such as Urban Outfitters, the new allure they have given the turntable and the image associated with owning records by artists they’ve never listened to. 
It also helps that the most popular artists of today continue to release vinyl editions of their music. The Arctic Monkeys’ 2013 release of their fifth album, AM, became one of the best-selling vinyl records of the decade. 
In 2017 thus far, the most popular vinyl album goes to Ed Sheeran’s record, having sold 31,000 copies since its release in March. In second place stands a reissue of The Beatles’ throwback tracks from their classic album Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Not far behind is the soundtrack to the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie on vinyl, once again demonstrating the typical millennial fascination with blending the past with the present.
However, one factor not driving millennials to purchase vinyl records  is pure nostalgia. As noted by a letter to the editor in response to the Los Angeles Times article, “Why is vinyl making a comeback? ‘Nostalgia’ doesn’t quite cut it,” the assumption millennials could be buying out of nostalgia isn’t completely true, because saying all millennials — especially those born closer to the Generation Z starting point — are buying out of nostalgia doesn’t make sense. How can someone be nostalgic for something they never had? How can a 20-year-old long for an album that came out 21 years ago? The nostalgia fueling the millennial vinyl industry boom is not due to direct experiences; rather, they hope to live vicariously in the past through these objects. 
Still, the love millennials have shown, and continue to show, toward objects and cultural elements of the past is a signifying marker of a generation that can coexist with both the past, present and  future. Millennials make up a generation that can truly have it all.
Next to professional grade reel to reel tape, vinyl remains the best known medium for both recording and reproducing sound.  The reason for this is rather obvious since sound by its very nature is purely analog in origin.
While it shouldn’t be the case, vinyl sounds better. In the mastering process, digital recordings are usually “levelled.” Levelling makes life easy, people don’t have to adjust volume. As a result, most recordings are now sonically boring: people flip songs constantly.
To really hear the sound of vinyl, your turntable/tonearm/cartridge should be pretty good. Don’t buy ’em from Urban Outfitters!

Lisa Kam | Daily Trojan
With the onset of another school year, students, families and administrators are bracing for another round of SAT scores, graduation preparation and, often, exorbitant levels of student debt. But lost among these overwhelming figures lies an oft-forgotten statistic: Each year, 65,000 undocumented students graduate from U.S. high schools, but few of these students can even dream of higher education.
Federal law bars undocumented students from accessing federal student financial aid. On the state level, aid also remains unattainable and in-state public colleges require undocumented students to pay out-of-state tuition, grounding the educational ambitions of a vast and crucial segment of the population.
The 2016 election brought discussion of immigration and the rights of undocumented people to the forefront of national dialogue. And beneath the inflammatory rhetoric, there lies a serious debate about what the U.S. government owes to global citizens in the form of foreign aid, and, closer to home, to the millions of undocumented immigrants who have woven themselves into the fabric of this nation.
The conventional, primary function of the government — to promote the welfare of its citizens — seemingly overlooks the needs of undocumented immigrants, rendering it a foregone conclusion that, at the very least, American students ought to receive priority for limited financial resources over immigrant students.
But many of these undocumented students arrived in this country at a young age, with hope and fear in their hearts as they embarked on a new and dangerous journey paved with hatred, dangers and inequity. And of the United States’ undocumented immigrants, eight of the roughly 11 million are employed, but nearly half of those employed pay Social Security taxes and all of them pay taxes in other forms, such as excise, sin and sales taxes. These immigrants contribute to the nation monetarily in myriad fashions – it’s time the United States not only recognized their efforts but also facilitated opportunities for further economic growth through higher education.
DACA, short for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a law passed under President Barrack Obama, allows those who entered the country as minors to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation as well as work permit eligibility, and it remains the law of the land. A general bipartisan consensus is that pathways to citizenship represent the way forward on the immigration front. Eighty-four percent of Americans favor a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, according to a Gallup poll from 2016). When it comes to immigrants already in the country, it makes little sense to stifle the educational pursuits of future citizens and a workforce that will help stabilize the economy and social security system. And with only a small percentage of the electorate willing to stomach mass deportations, immigrants, who are statistically more law-abiding than native-born Americans, deserve every opportunity to contribute fully to America’s economic vitality.
Yet few Americans wish to see undocumented students compete with American citizens for coveted financial aid and loans. Even fewer wish to extrapolate the case study of Los Angeles, where different marginalized populations struggle for precious resources. Though monetary resources may be finite, and as idealistic as this proposition may be, the United States must resolve to prioritize education opportunities and outcomes for all students. 
Regardless of whether the federal and state governments ought to help finance undocumented students’ education, the public sector consistently fails to fulfill its responsibilities from fighting hunger and homelessness to boosting education. This can sometimes necessitate the intervention of the private sector to fill in the gaps. But the private assumption of public obligations raises the question of how large a role the private sector ought to play, especially in the case of education.
In light of these restrictive federal and state policies, nonprofits have stepped up to the challenge. TheDream.US has committed close to $43 million to 1,700 undocumented students this year. And smaller organizations, such as the Noble Network of Charter Schools has dedicated $2 million to a small class of students.
Philanthropy for the financing of undocumented students’ college plans represents another facet of the privatization of education. But instead of public dollars funding access to private education, as seen with the voucher system supported by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, private dollars fund access to public education.
Despite the laudable nature of this goal, private philanthropy can only go so far and cover so many students. The United States must not allow charitable donations to mask its own failures, because without reform at the state and federal level, tens of thousands of students will be denied higher education and better livelihoods. If America as a country truly believes in this ideal of education for all, then it must commit to equal access to college for all students, undocumented or not.
 
No. As soon as USC starts doing this, they will lose all the time and money I donate to them
I don’t want any of my donations going to illegal aliens — period.  On the other hand, I believe USC should offer full scholarships to those who truly deserve it — i.e., former American foster kids who age out of the system at 18 and have no family upon which to depend.  Those foster alumni deserve financial support, not those whose parents broke the law and invaded our country illegally and now refuse to go home.
Scholarships should only be available to undocumented students after they have been deported. Then the universities of the students’ respective home countries should do everything they can to educate their citizens.
I don’t see why we should award foreign nationals who either deliberately circumvented our nation’s immigration check points or cynically overstayed their tourist visas or were trafficked into this country by their parents. These people have demonstrated nothing but contempt for the rule of law. USC doesn’t condone cheating on tests or students turning in essays written by others so why condone cross-border infiltration?
Scholarships for illegal aliens?  How many American citizens will not get scholarships because illegal aliens will get them?
“Sorry, Meagan and Jason, you have wonderful civic accomplishments, high school grades, and SAT scores. And we see that your families are not well off. You are perfect candidates for USC scholarships!”
“Alas, you two will not get them, because we are giving them to illegal aliens, who entered our country against the law, and somehow get preferential treatment over American citizens.”
“Why? You ask why? Because it is “politically correct” and fashionable to treat them with special favor. Now, get out of my office and go somewhere else for your scholarships.”
No tuition money for illegals.  Allocate it only to citizens.  If USC starts giving money to illegals, then I will cease supporting the school immediately.  Illegals are not equals to citizens regards government benefits.
Lunderful, I agree. Using the precious resources of an American university for illegals is an outrageous misallocation of money. But you mentioned government benefits. If USC were to throw away its money on illegals, that would not be a government benefit. Federal, state or local money given to illegals would be a government benefit. That is probably already happening by virtue of the California legislature, and maybe from LA City and LA County, too goes to illegals. I hope not.
California (you and I) absolutely pays for undocumented students by allowing them to attend at in-state tuition. Your argument is biased and flawed in many ways. People who pay the taxes should benefit directly from these taxes. Illegals or undocumented gain free health, education, and welfare here in California until they are 18 years old.  To have to pay for their college tuition as well is ridiculous when our own children can’t get services because there isn’t enough money to go around. The U.S. is not a charity, although we have charity in our hearts, as evidenced by the tremendous amount of effort we take and spend on people who are in our country illegally, as well as our charity around the world. Fine, you don’t like the immigration laws, then change them. In the meantime, respect and enforce them, just as you would want under your set of ideals. Many people do not agree with you; I am one of them. I am not the enemy. I am a countryman with a different perspective on this subject.

Kylie Cheung is the editorial director of the Daily Trojan. Her column,“You do Uterus,” runs every Thursday.
This summer, I had the privilege of working as an intern at the National Network of Abortion Funds. I went into the internship having closely followed and written about reproductive rights for years, and emerge from it educated about the issue’s nuances. From challenges the movement currently faces to be more inclusive of trans and non-binary people, to the inadvertently damaging effect of statements like “only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services are abortion,” there was a lot that I hadn’t previously considered. 
But as we begin a new academic year, my thoughts are with activists at UC Berkeley and women’s health and leadership organizations I had the fortune of speaking with — activists who have been at the forefront of bringing access to medication abortion, a two-pill dosage of misoprostol and mifepristone that terminates pregnancies by inhibiting the hormones necessary for pregnancy, to college campuses for the past two years. A student-led campaign moved from the university’s student government to a national policy institute to the California state legislature, where it has passed the California State Assembly and one state Senate committee. The legislation is currently on hold as research continues to be conducted.
Meanwhile, there’s been radio silence from USC administration, as California public colleges are poised to bring access to abortion to their health centers. USC would be virtually unaffected by such legislation being signed into law, but that doesn’t mean the University shouldn’t take action on the issue of abortion accessibility on campus.
For some context, more than 1,000 restrictions on reproductive rights have already been introduced in state legislatures across the country this year as of April. The path to the procedure is paved with financial, geographic and a range of legal obstacles. And while plenty of demographics face their own unique, burdensome and often dangerous barriers, young people arguably face the most. Across the country, minors are being told that their bodies are the property of their parents or guardians, as they are prohibited from terminating a pregnancy without parental consent or permission from a judge. 
And for young women in college, the many trips associated with getting an abortion  mean missing class and work as well as throwing money down the drain — all of which are unaffordable to students with severely limited budgets. The burden for students in rural parts of California, where the nearest clinic offering abortion services can be an all-day road trip away, and especially for the many without cars, is even greater.
When it comes down to it, this is a Title IX issue in no uncertain terms. A range of policies and circumstances around abortion, who needs it and who is able to access it — intended or not — are affecting who is able to have a quality education and achieve academic and professional success based on gender. Male college students will never have to undergo the trauma and anxiety that come with an unwanted pregnancy, nor the exhaustion that comes with navigating every nuanced step to obtain the procedure. They won’t wake up with morning sickness or miss class, work or internships to drive for hours for an ultrasound and then the procedure the next day.
The argument that universities like USC have no liability to offer abortion access because they provide free condoms is a moot point: Should have, could have, would haves don’t terminate unintended pregnancies, and the insinuation that the only people seeking abortions are irresponsible, flighty young women is a baseless stereotype. Research has shown again and again that the majority of young women who have abortions used some form of contraception when they conceived. 
However, none of this is to say that the fight for medication abortion access at the Engemann Student Health Center would be an easy one for students to have with administration, nor for administration to have with conservative donors.
Even at UC Berkeley, where the student government overwhelmingly passed a resolution in support of health center medication abortion access, a leader of the Students United for Reproductive Justice talked to me about why the Cal administration has stalled on responding to this demand, despite the group’s demonstration of where adequate funding could be obtained. Some of these concerns, such as fear of drawing violent protesters to the health center or losing federal funding, were more valid than others, such as concerns about the safety of abortion. 
And speaking of the issue of safety and abortion, here’s something I observed long before my internship this summer: Within the abortion rights dialogue, anti-abortion lawmakers are only concerned with women’s safety as far as they can use this “concern” to their advantage by further stigmatizing the procedure or by justifying barriers that make it more difficult for women to make safe, independent decisions about their bodies. The procedure — as well as the medication, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for years — is objectively safe. Rather, protesters and restrictive laws are what lead to injuries from self-termination and our current national maternal mortality crisis. 
But what does this all mean for young women as they return to or perhaps set foot on their college campuses for the first time? Make no mistake: This isn’t about politics or spreading partisan ideology — it’s about gender parity in education, and what USC can and must do to give female students equal opportunity. 
 
“The many trips associated with getting an abortion mean missing class and work as well as throwing money down the drain.”  Wow, what about the human life that’s flushed down the drain?  That is the true burden that the mother, father, and all of society have to bear.  Please consider not having premarital sex so you don’t have to worry about aborting another human being.
No one is going to halt having sex. Boy you prolifers are so naive.
Another way to look at it is you pro-abortionists are such cold-blooded killers.
And you pro-birthers just hate women and want to go back to the dark ages.
Also hypocrites since you know you hate the “murder” of unborn children but are okay with them dying on the streets. Who is cold-blooded again?
At USC where is it inequitable for females?  Where is there opportunity for males, but not for females? Please be specific.

From the first time students step on the USC campus, they hear about the Trojan Family. They are welcomed into it, told of its legacy and embraced by its rich tradition. 
This can seem daunting, intangible, mythical, even far-fetched. But I can promise you that whether you are the first in your family to attend college or a fourth-generation Trojan, the Trojan Family will take hold of you during your four years here, and will carry on with you long after you leave the campus. 
Whether you are part of an extensive USC legacy, or you are forging a legacy of your own, this special issue aims to give you an introduction into the Trojan Family — the good, the bad and the historic. 
For me, Cardinal and Gold runs in my blood. I am the sixth in my family to attend USC. Each family member experienced USC in a unique way, and found their way to the Trojan Family on their own terms, but it was my grandfather who made me believe in the Trojan Family. 
My grandfather, Charles McDonald, graduated from USC in 1958, exactly 60 years from my scheduled graduation date in May. His love for USC defied time and space. He attended every USC football game, even those outside of Los Angeles, until his legs could no longer support him. He could be found at every home game, perched on his USC walker, fingers laced together in his lap, watching the team he had loved for so long. 
He used to tell me that, as a young boy, he would listen to the USC football games on his handheld radio and wait to hear the band playing “Conquest.” Until the year he died, his eyes would well up with tears when he heard the opening notes, memories and pride bubbling up inside him. In fact, he loved the song so much that he asked it be played at his funeral. 
When he died my freshman year at USC, he left me his USC class ring, battered and imperfect, just like he was. He left it wrapped up in a crumbled piece of notebook paper, where he had written, “I treasured this ring like I treasure you.” 
To some, it may seem odd to have a dying wish of passing on a college ring, but that’s the power of the Trojan Family. And that was when I first knew it existed.
It may not come to you in a 60-year-old class ring, or in a funeral soundtracked to the Trojan Marching Band, but when it comes, you’ll know. 
To the Trojan Family past and present, this one’s for you.

When the University announced the construction of the USC Village in 2011, it made no shortage of promises. 
These promises included a range of student housing options to help address skyrocketing rents in the community, the creation of thousands of jobs for South Los Angeles residents and “a wide range of high-quality, affordable retail,” according to a University press release. “Student customer price points and community member custom prices points are an extremely good match.” 
However, a State of the Neighborhood Report conducted by the University in 2015 estimated that about 47.3 percent of families with children in the University Park Campus area were living in poverty between 2008 and 2012 —  close to double the overall rate for Los Angeles. Additionally, the rate of families in poverty in the UPC area has increased by 11.5 percent since 2000.
Moreover, an unsettling correlation exists between community displacement associated with USC-related ventures and poverty rates in the area, according to the same report. As the local population unaffiliated with USC has decreased due to displacement, the number of families facing economic and health issues has increased. 
Despite these statistics, USC continues to expand into the surrounding community, with the renovated USC Village standing as the most recent example. Small businesses that originally set up shop in the old University Village are watching their storefronts be replaced with retail and corporate chains they believe many members of the community will struggle to afford. 
Daisy Castro is the current office manager of Kravitz Optometry, which operated in the University Village from 1984 until its recent move to Figueroa Street in the University Gateway complex when renovations began.
“When I started at the [University] Village … it was like you’re living in a little old town,” said Castro, who has been working at the practice since 1986. 
She recalled memories of a shopping center closely knit with its surrounding community and local family life — neighborhood caroling at the University Village around Christmastime, a costume contest for children on Halloween and an affordable and accessible grocery store called Market Superior.
“The Village was very involved with the neighbors, but when USC bought it, everything declined,” Castro said. “People who were there were raising prices, and the community was leaving. They left, and they got new people coming in … because of the price. USC was making those changes because they had a project in mind, they wanted everybody out so they could build what they just built now.”
She predicts that, with upcoming changes, locals will only steadily depart from an area that no longer serves their needs. 
“I think that’s mainly designed for students, not the community,” Castro said of the shops and eateries coming to the USC Village this fall. “They [USC] want to have a better presentation from across the street from the University, to have something as pretty as we see now.”
In October 2012, the Daily Trojan reported that USC’s first USC Village proposal, the “Specific Plan,” did not include provisions for current tenants to have spots at the renovated Village. It was not until business owners pressured the University that it included an addendum, which required the University to negotiate with tenants and retain those in good standing prior to demolition.
According to USC’s Real Estate and Asset Management Department, at the time, of the 45 Village tenants not associated with USC, only Starbucks and Bank of America were able to negotiate their futures at the new USC Village. The other 43 tenants, unsure of their fate, had to shift to month-to-month leases in the time leading up to demolition.
This move toward month-to-month leases marked the beginning of an end for Magic Machine University Graphics, a print and copy store owned by Gery Zokai, who emigrated from Persia in 1987 and bought the store shortly after. Zokai’s son, Mike Zokai, remembers the emotional toll that the development took on his father.
“He was in a bit of a panic because he was losing his business, and the hard part about it was that after all the work he had put into it for the past 30 years, he wasn’t even able to sell the business,” Mike Zokai said. “At that point, with the changes, no one would look at the business anymore.”
According to Mike Zokai, his father moved Magic Machine University Graphics to different locations within the University Village several times after the month-to-month leases began, in hopes to stay open for as long as possible. 
“All the businesses had closed down on that side of the mall, so there wasn’t any foot traffic,” Mike Zokai said. “So he thought if he were to move over there, he could at least get a little bit of the foot traffic and still maybe be able to sustain himself. But this was not the case, and it went totally the opposite.” 
In addition to the addendum, University Village business owners in 2012 asked for right of first refusal, rent subsidies if they return and financial assistance for relocation. Some of these business owners told the Daily Trojan at the time that USC offered to provide experts in relocating businesses to help them with their moves.
Sean Keklikyan, owner of the Village Cobbler, said after he completed an application to return to the renovated USC Village, USC not only helped him find a place to set up shop in the interim, but also worked closely with him to make this a reality.
But some tenants say this was not their experience.
“I don’t think they [USC] helped relocate Dr. Kravitz — like I said, I’m the one who told him, ‘Let’s go and see these places if you like it, and you can move there,’” Castro said. “But no, nobody said to him, ‘Oh by the way, you can come here or move there,’ — no.”
Castro recalled meetings hosted by the University for former Village businesses about renovations. She remembers some of the business owners, whom she was very close to, telling her about talks to get their businesses to stay. But she could recall “no direct contact” between Kravitz and USC about the future of their business.
Mike Zokai said he vaguely remembers an offer by the University to relocate Magic Machine University Graphics into the new USC Village, but a combination of the increase in rent at the Village and the evolution of technology ultimately led to his father’s decision to close the shop permanently. 
“Once you lose your customers it’s really hard to try and get them back,” Mike Zokai said. “And the new stuff they did at USC during that time, they established their own printing and copy centers, so anyone that used to go to [our shop] had no choice but to go to the other locations owned by USC. It didn’t make sense for him to reinvest in it because there wasn’t enough opportunity for him to reestablish himself in that arena.”
In response to relocation efforts, Steve Wesson, the USC Village ombudsman, told the Daily Trojan that the University took many steps to help retail tenants with relocation.
“Tenants in good standing received as much as $17,500 in direct financial assistance,” Wesson said in an email statement. “The University also helped qualifying tenants with lease negotiations and business plans. Retail tenants were given the opportunity to apply for space at USC Village, and three of those businesses returned to the site.”
Mike Zokai confirmed that the University did offer his father’s shop financial assistance, which amounted to less than $10,000. Compared to the business itself, which was worth a quarter of a million dollars at the time, according to Mike Zokai, the compensation was only equal to a few months’ worth of rent. 
“For a company that had established itself for over 25 to 30 years, a few thousand dollars was kind of a slap in the face,” Zokai said. “They were like, ‘We’re only giving you one or two months to be able to sustain yourself, so find something.’ They didn’t really evaluate or calculate how the value of the business was going to change just because they decided to do some development. It was okay that they did it, but the compensation was not well-calculated.” 
Stemming from concern for local small businesses and a neighboring community with considerable poverty rates, USC Village construction was originally met with disapproval from the Los Angeles City Council and many in the community. The University responded to these concerns with promises of $7 million in community benefits, $20 million in affordable housing by adding 3,000 additional student beds and the creation of 8,000 construction-related and 4,000 permanent jobs. USC also set up a job fair catered specifically to South Los Angeles residents, promising more than 30 percent of these jobs would be offered to members of the community.
However, despite these community benefits, many local tenants who owned businesses at the old University Village are still grappling with the effects of being displaced. 
Mike Zokai’s father, for example, has been unable to find a steady job since Magic Machine University Graphics’ closing.
“He’s not really retired — he’s trying to find things here and there to do, but unfortunately because of age and technology, it’s been a little bit of a challenge for him to tap into anything,” Mike Zokai said. “It’s been a loss for him. It’s actually affected his health in a way, because of not being able to work and the pressure of not having the type of income he had.”
The renovation of the USC Village has served to exemplify the conflicting pressures to meet the needs of a growing university while addressing local poverty rates. USC’s transition from a commuter to a residential university over the past few decades has required more and more student housing and services, which have contributed to an increase rent prices and displacement of South L.A. residents. 
In addition to higher poverty rates, this displacement has also negatively impacted community diversity and public health, especially within communities of color. A report published by the Human Impact Partners and Esperanza Community Housing Corporation in 2012 found the population of black and Latina/o residents around USC decreased by 20.3 percent and 15 percent, respectively, between 2000 and 2010, despite growing throughout other parts of Los Angeles.
In recent years, residents of the area surrounding UPC have been displaced faster and more often than residents in other L.A. areas, due to surging student demand for living closer to campus, according to the Human Impact report.
However, Keklikyan of the Village Cobbler looks forward to what he predicts will be a bright future for his shop, as he believes the new USC Village will bring his shop new customers.
“I’m happy with everything because it’s going to be safer, more modern, and I think this change is good,” Keklikyan said. “Since it’s a new shopping mall, new shops around us, new people will come, too.”
Meanwhile, Daisy Castro has a dim view of Kravitz Optometry’s current surroundings, which differ from the small, tightly knit community she spent the better part of the past 30 years working in.
“Now, it’s just traffic every day,” Castro said, describing what she sees outside on Figueroa Street — not the families and children and locals she used to see every day. “But I guess we’re more reachable now, just down the street from the school, because people see us more. There’s that.”
Although the USC Village’s opening has been highly-anticipated and well-covered in the news, Mike Zokai said it’s a topic his father tries to forget.
“At this point, I think he’s heartbroken … he hasn’t really gone to that area because it brought a lot of suffering for him,” Mike Zokai said.
 
No, you dont satisfy “everybody” for anything you could ever do in your life. It is just impossible to do a 100% good thing without ANY side effect. I feel that daily trojan is really just the dark side of usc news, bashing everything. The so called critical analysis thing has really got the better of the editors at sc. They are trying to do critical analysis on everything. lol

Steven Kramer | Daily Trojan
When 40,000 people are tied together by their scholarship and ambition on a single college campus, it’s not long before USC students realized they’re part of something bigger. It’s a natural part of everyone’s matriculation on campus — when admitted, students are assured that they’ll soon join the ranks of illustrious alumni like George Lucas and Neil Armstrong. Soon, they’re told, they’ll be part of the Trojan Family.
But for senior and mechanical engineering major Drew Halderman, the Trojan Family is a little more literal. Halderman is the 19th person in his family to attend USC, and his presence on campus follows a rich family history intertwined with that of the University. 
Albert Bannister, Halderman’s great-great-great grandfather, taught commercial and economic science at USC from 1892 to 1905. The first member of his family to attend the University, Halderman’s great-great grandmother Florence Bannister-Halderman graduated in the late 1890s. The 18 others in his family, spanning six generations, who have ties to USC’s campus include his great grandmother, great-great uncle, grandfather, great uncle, father and cousins.
Growing up among Trojans, Halderman’s early childhood is chock-full of fond memories of USC. At the mere age of 7, Halderman attended his first USC football game against UCLA at the Rose Bowl in 2004. With two long touchdown runs from Reggie Bush, USC punched its ticket to the Orange Bowl — and fans went wild.
“It was the coolest thing to me to see how excited everybody got watching that game, and all the fans were screaming and yelling,” Halderman said. “When I was 7 it just blew my mind.”
Halderman spent much of his childhood and adolescence at USC football games. He remembers the rush of the USC-Stanford game that he attended as a high school senior. Students and guests rushed the field after the game — and the energy was contagious.
“I was like — this is where I want to be,” Halderman said. “I love this school.”
So when it came time for Halderman to attend college, USC felt like the natural choice. A teenager on the brink of adulthood, Halderman knew that USC could bridge his past and his future.
“When the whole application rolled around, it was almost like I didn’t think of USC as a college or university,” Halderman said. “It was just a place that I went all the time every single year.”
On campus, Halderman tries to experience USC as much as possible. Halderman joined Trojan Knights his freshman year and Phi Delta Theta his sophomore year. He also spent two years participating in Undergraduate Student Government as a delegate.
But even when he steps off campus, the Trojan spirit is still waiting for Halderman at home. Whenever he sees his grandfather, the conversation always seems to come back to USC football.
“Whenever I go to his house, the first thing that comes up for the first hour I talk to him is football,” Halderman said. “‘How’s the team this year? How’s Sam Darnold? How’s this and that?’ Every single time without fail. Every single time.”
Yet, despite the omnipresence of USC in Halderman’s life, Halderman has more than just Trojan blood. Halderman’s mother attended Stanford, which yields a friendly college rivalry.
“My mom has been gloating the past couple years about how we’ve been getting beat by their team,” Halderman said. “I’ll get a call after a football game — like a ‘ha ha, in your face’ kind of thing.”
Regardless, Halderman still feels deeply tethered to the Trojan identity, and he harbors a profound appreciation for his role in a much larger legacy. For him, the term “Trojan Family” takes a complex form.
“At first, coming in, it was kind of a feeling of building onto the Trojan family and Trojan tradition I already had, but I figured out it was almost like finding a new home,” Halderman said. “It was almost like creating my own new family.”

USC was at a standstill. 
“Tirebiter is dead!” read the Daily Trojan’s front page headline on September 20, 1950. It was only three years after the beloved canine was crowned USC’s official mascot. 
For eight days, students questioned George Tirebiter’s legacy. After a contentious 800-518 vote by the student body, a puppy named George Tirebiter II beat out Hector the Horse to succeed Tirebiter as USC’s mascot. 
Though Hector did not emerge as the victor, his appearance in the final vote was a sign that the USC community was still desperately searching for the perfect embodiment of the Trojan spirit. It would take another 11 years for them to discover what they were looking for. 
Today, the statue of a noble white horse stands directly across from Tommy Trojan in USC’s central plaza. Students and visitors attempt to mount the statue, throwing “Fight On” signs and snapping photos along the way. His name is Traveler, the Trojans’ pride and joy at every football home game. A university icon in his own right, Traveler symbolizes USC’s rising prowess in both academia and athletics.
This year marks a new chapter in the University’s history: the debut of Traveler IX. And as the Trojan Family looks forward to the future, this 56-year-old mascot remains one of the University’s most enduring traditions — one that continues to inspire generations of Trojans to fight on and conquer challenges that await them every day.

A twist of fate
Traveler was neither the first mascot nor the first horse to march through the field at the Coliseum. After the death of the original USC mascot Tirebiter in 1950, the student body struggled to find an appropriate canine successor to continue Tirebiter’s legacy. 
It was fate that allowed student Eddie Tannenbaum to discover Traveler in 1961. Eleven years after USC’s decision to keep George Tirebiter, Tannenbaum knew that it was time for change.
“I wanted to find a mascot more symbolic of the University,” Tannenbaum said. 
By sheer luck and coincidence, Tannenbaum and Bob Jani, then-director of special events, noticed Richard Saukko riding his white horse Traveler through the Rose Parade. It was then that Tannenbaum orchestrated the rise of a new mascot that he believed epitomized USC’s fighting spirit.
Traveler and Saukko were asked to perform at the 1961 football season opener against Georgia Tech. What was only supposed to be a one-time gig became a mainstay at USC, as spectators erupted in cheers after seeing him trotting out of the tunnel and braving the field. Opting to keep his original name, USC adopted Traveler as the University’s official mascot following the stunning debut.
The mascot’s name has been subject to rumors and speculation in years past. In an unsigned obituary for Saukko, the Los Angeles Times wrote that Traveler was named after the horse of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. More recently, the Black Student Assembly denounced Traveler as a symbol of white supremacy amid the violent attacks that occurred in Charlottesville, Va. 
Pat Saukko DeBernardi, Richard Saukko’s wife, has tried to dispel the rumors behind the origin of Traveler’s name, claiming to the Times that the horse was already named before Saukko purchased it in 1958. In addition, the University has also reaffirmed its stance on Traveler following inquiries from the Los Angeles Times. 
“USC’s mascot is a symbol of ancient Troy. Its rider, with costume and sword, is a symbol of a Trojan warrior,” a USC spokesman wrote in a statement. “The name Traveler, spelled with one ‘l,’ is a common name among horses … USC’s Traveler is and has always been a proud symbol of Troy. There is no truth to any other claims or rumors about its name.”
More than just a mascot
Trojans and fans anticipate this moment at every football home game: The grandeur of Traveler and his Trojan warrior galloping around the Coliseum to “Conquest” after every touchdown. 
Traveler’s adoption into the Trojan family was universally accepted and welcomed, as his appearance became an expectation and demand at other University functions beyond home games. Until 2003, the Saukko family bred and trained the first six Travelers.
“The University package includes Traveler, and I think people look forward to seeing him when they’re at a game and seeing him a lot,” Tannenbaum said.
Eight other Travelers have succeeded Traveler I and also contributed to the mascot’s reputation as the centerpiece of of Trojan fanfare. To celebrate the equine mascot, then-USC president Steven Sample dedicated a Traveler statue at Hahn Plaza in 2010.  
Fifty-six years after Traveler’s conception, Tannenbaum looks back with nostalgia as he reminisces  about Traveler’s transformation throughout the course of both his life and USC’s history. He chuckles when he reflects on his time as Traveler’s keeper. He smiles when he sees students snapping photos with the Traveler statue. And he cheers from his seat when Traveler makes his way around the football field, content with his contribution to something much larger than himself: the Trojan family.
“I’m [really] proud of my legacy,” Tannenbaum said. “I’m very lucky to be a part of something on the University campus. And as minor as it sounds, I think [Traveler is] the best mascot that any university has.”
The line of succession
It’s the night before an 11 a.m. home game. 
Traveler and his rider Hector Aguilar have just finished riding through the hills for several hours. His muscles are warmed up, and he spends the night at a stable in Burbank, Calif. At 4 a.m., Traveler gets bathed and groomed for the big day. By 6 a.m., he and his owner Joanne Asman arrive at Gate 11 at the Coliseum, where is he kept until his big appearance prior to kickoff.
In 2003, Joanne Asman succeeded the Saukko family as Traveler’s primary breeder. Asman has worked with USC for the past 14 years, playing an integral role in training her Travelers to become the darling Andalusian horses that embody USC’s fighting spirit. And it was through her that Traveler VII was selected. 
Since his debut, the seventh mascot has been adored for his majestic appearance, love of attention and ability to work through chaotic environments. But at age 26, he is facing retirement as Traveler IX — Traveler VIII never made it to the Coliseum — makes his way to the pedestal this fall to continue the Traveler legacy. 
“He’s not happy giving up his position. He loves being Traveler, from the first running he did on the field, he went, ‘Ooh, this is nice, I like it,’” Asman said of Traveler VII. “He gets a little jealous every now and then, so we’re not going to make him stop until he tells us he’s ready to stop totally.”
For the past two years, Asman and Aguilar have been preparing Traveler IX for his big introduction. Painting USC end zones on red carpet, having children cheer with pom-poms and appearing at the Spirit of Troy’s band camp have all been part of the young horse’s training. 
“What we look for [in the transition] from Traveler VII to Traveler IX is making sure he has the right mindset to do the job because not every horse can do it,” Aguilar said. “Not every horse can tolerate all that commotion and noise … so it takes a very special horse.”
The transition between the two horses has shown that there are some personality differences between the two equine companions. And though character contrast may affect how the horses interact with crowds, one thing remains the same: They will both be loved and adored by USC fans. 
“Traveler IX is a little more lovable, in that he wants be up against you [and] wants to be petted all the time whereas [Traveler VII] likes it, but he’s just as happy being by himself,” Asman said.
For both Asman and Aguilar, preparing a horse to continue Traveler’s legacy has not been an easy task.  But it’s been one of the most rewarding accomplishments of their lives, allowing them to become members of the Trojan Family along the way.
“It’s a great thrill — a great privilege to ride a horse not only in the Coliseum, but also as Tommy Trojan,” Aguilar said about his legacy as the seventh Trojan warrior. “Riding Traveler for all the history it has and all its traditions, it’s really a great honor.”
Asman realized she was a part of the Trojan family when a benefactor flew Traveler out to Florida for the 2005 Orange Bowl to surprise alumni and students when the Trojans played against Oklahoma. 
“What I’ve noticed more than anything else working with USC versus any other colleges is that they’re family,” Asman said. “When you are a part of USC, you are always a part of USC.”
At USC, traditions remain a fundamental part of the University’s culture. And while Traveler IX may be new, he soon will carry the history and tradition that have inspired Trojans for 56 years.
See you on the field, Traveler IX.

Photo courtesy of Trisha Tucker
Tall and willowy, striking blue eyes, blonde hair cut in a sleek bob: Trisha Tucker looks as if she could be an actress on the silver screen. But instead, she wrote about them  — for a little while, anyway. 
“I worked at the Hollywood Reporter, and that was the most fun job I think you can possibly get coming out of undergrad,” Tucker said. 
Her stint as a journalist was the only period of her career where Tucker wasn’t involved with USC. Tucker attended USC as both an undergraduate and graduate student, and currently works as an assistant professor of Writing for the Thematic Option program.  
Tucker’s vested interest in the entertainment industry seems to have imparted a cinematic quality to her real life. When Tucker first stepped foot on the USC campus as a fresh-faced undergraduate in 1999, some girls from her floor proposed getting lunch just as her family was leaving, in a moment that seems to have been plucked straight from a Hollywood blockbuster. 
“Those particular girls, along with my roommate, ended up being some of my best friends through college,” Tucker said. “It feels like fate that I was feeling really lonely, on the verge of crying, and these girls invited me out and now I’ve been in their weddings and they’ve been in my wedding.” 
With its prestigious arts programs and prime location in the middle of southern California, Tucker harbored no doubts about heading to USC for college. She majored in English and double minored in music industry and film, which was no mean feat. 
“I knew I wanted to come to Los Angeles, and all the schools I applied to were local here,” Tucker said. “USC to me had the best combination of big-school opportunities and amenities, but also a more intimate feel, more personalized attention from teachers.” 
Tucker was a typical honors student: high-achieving, participating in salsa dance, working as a tour guide and helping out in the Thornton School’s opera department. She also worked off-campus at an entertainment law firm, which didn’t leave much time in the day for her to take advantage of all the clubs and organizations on campus as she would have liked. 
“The student body is so enthusiastic and they participate in a lot of things,” Tucker said. “So me, looking back and only being able to rattle off a few things I did — even though I loved doing them — it felt like other students were able to be more involved and I think I would’ve really enjoyed that.” 
After graduating, Tucker’s job at the Hollywood Reporter granted her access to fancy galas and movie premieres, as well as the opportunity to interview high-profile actors and directors whom she admired. But, as much fun as she was having, she wasn’t satisfied; she wanted to make a difference through more fulfilling work. 
“At 50 years old, if I looked at the pieces I’d written, I was worried that I wasn’t going to feel like I had spent my time and my energy in a meaningful way,” Tucker said.  
Eventually, Tucker gravitated back to USC to complete her doctorate in English, specializing in 19th-century British evangelical literature. As a graduate student, she also taught for five years, two of which were through the Thematic Option program, before becoming a full-time staff member as the associate director of the writing program. 
Tucker quickly discovered a passion and natural talent for teaching.  
“I had an amazingly well-rounded pedagogical experience, and that helped me to discover how meaningful I find teaching, which is what I get to do now,” Tucker said.
Tucker is currently an assistant professor for the Thematic Option honors program, and also oversees all the writing instruction, mentoring the graduate student instructors and developing curriculum. 
“I love my job because it’s part straight-on teaching of undergraduates, and part really mentoring and helping develop other teachers,” Tucker said. 
One of Tucker’s students, Ryan McIlvain, has maintained a friendship with her long after he took her pedagogy class. McIlvain, who is now an assistant professor of English at the University of Tampa, was impressed by her natural aptitude for teaching and hoped to live up to her example. 
“I was amazed by her work ethic and her talent as a teacher,” McIlvain said. “She is that rare combination of someone who’s very good at teaching, clearly loves it, and is going to work eight days a week to make sure that she does it well and the people she teaches will learn to do it well too.” 
Tucker’s colleague, Emily Hodgson Anderson, is also quick to laud Tucker’s conscientiousness and thoughtfulness in her approach to teaching. Anderson, an assistant professor of English, taught a Thematic Option Core course in conjunction with Tucker’s writing course. 
“I’ve learned so many good teaching strategies from her, and learned how to be more thoughtful in my own approach,” Anderson said. “I particularly like how she incorporates her own struggles as a student into how she teaches other students, as opposed to pretending that this is always easy for her.” 
Tucker has also lent her skills to other leadership roles at USC; this year she will be the President of the Dornsife Faculty Council, and she also served on the USC Faculty Senate. Additionally, as if she wasn’t already entrenched in campus life, Tucker has spent the summer preparing to move into the Village. One of six residential faculty members selected for the position, she will be living in the McCarthy Honors Dorm. 
“I’m really excited about all the opportunities to interact with students in a way that’s different than in the classroom,” Tucker said. “As somebody who met some of the best friends of my life living in the honors residence hall, just the idea of living with and getting to interact with honor students in particular was so attractive to me. It made me feel like I’d be coming full circle from my own student experience.” 
Having spent so many years living and studying on campus, she was granted the unique opportunity to witness USC’s evolution from a campus slightly insulated from the surrounding neighborhood to a flourishing and active member of the community. 
“There was nowhere nearby here to go eat and go hang out. Campus just felt very isolated,” Tucker said. “Now there’s a whole USC town. There’s so much more to do — and eat!” 
It’s clear that Tucker’s ties to USC run deep, and she has no intention of cutting them anytime soon. 
“I have no plans to leave,” Tucker said. “I never set out to be somebody who would always be at USC; it was not my plan, but there are a lot of wonderful reasons to stay here.”

The Von KleinSmid Center for International Relations stands tall with its distinct globed tower high above campus. Under the structure’s grand arches, more than 100 international flags drape over its walkways, representing the home countries of international students at the University. 
The image of the building — emblematic of the University itself — is one of diversity and inclusion, but the Von KleinSmid Center is named after a president who carries a highly acclaimed, yet controversial legacy regarding just that. During his term as a University administrator, Von KleinSmid involved himself in the field of eugenics, a growing social science movement popularized in the early 20th century that encouraged reproduction of desirable traits, generally among whites, while discouraging reproduction in people with negative traits, particularly the poor, ethnic minorities and those deemed intellectually inferior.
Von KleinSmid accomplished much that is familiar to the Trojan legacy, such as creating significant scholarship programs, expanding campus land and increasing the University’s population. 
His presidency, which spanned from 1921 to 1947, occurred during a period of great political, social and technological change — throughout the Great Depression and World War II. 
When the eugenics movement began taking root in the 1920s, USC was not exempt from the elite educational institutions that supported it.
“[The field] was mainstream enough to be embraced by a wide array of scientists and experts and reformers who saw it as a way to solve social problems, like immigration and industrialization, that was shaping modern America,” said Alexandra Stern, a professor at the University of Michigan whose research specializes in the history of eugenics, society and justice. 
Von KleinSmid’s scholarship went hand-in-hand with those of other senior-level administrators from schools like the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and UCLA, according to Stern. Von KleinSmid published “Eugenics and the State,” and the publication was presented to the Cincinnati Academy of Medicine in 1913 — eight years before the start of his term as USC’s president. It called for states to preserve their society through segregation of inferior groups and forced sterilization. 
“A third method of handling the problem is suggested, namely, sterilization,” Von KleinSmid wrote. “We must all agree that those who, in the nature of the case, can do little else than pass on to their offsprings the defects which make themselves burdens to society, have no ethical right to parenthood.”
Von KleinSmid was a proponent of sterilization as an aspect of the eugenics movement since its inception.
“Clearly, [Von KleinSmid] was [involved] since the emergence of the eugenics movement, specifically with the push for sterilization,” Stern said. 
While serving as president, Von KleinSmid, alongside other USC administrators and professors, donated to or were members of regional and national eugenic groups. These groups invested in research and education to influence sterilization policies in California, since the state’s first law which allowed sterilization in 1909. 
“It’s safe to say that USC leaders played an active role in the eugenics movement,” Stern said of the period during Von KleinSmid’s presidency. 
Stern also acknowledged that eugenics was especially popular among upper intellectual circles, as it transitioned from a fringe scientific movement to a mainstream field.
During his presidency, Von KleinSmid co-founded the Human Betterment Foundation in 1928, a Pasadena-based think thank that promoted compulsory sterilization internationally as a mechanism for improving civilization. According to Kirsten Spicer in “A Nation of Imbeciles,” a 2015 paper published in the Chapman Historical Review, members of the HBF influenced Nazi Germany’s eugenics-based ideology through connections with top German intellectuals and officials. 
However, Von KleinSmid’s ties to the HBF were not the only USC-related connection to eugenics. According to documents from the Human Betterment Foundation, two USC sociology professors, Emory Bogardus and Kingsley Davis, were registered members, while other staff members and administrators were linked to the American Eugenics Society, a national eugenics group. 
According to Stern, some sociology and social work students at USC were also trained with a eugenics-inspired framework in their curriculum, which was popularized in the 1920s to 1940s as the national movement grew.
“USC trained people in social work programs to conduct studies that…operated in the eugenics framework with inferior and superior demographics,” Stern said. She also said the faculty who supported this curriculum were interested in social issues of the time, like immigration and the creation of a healthier, fitter society.
When asked for comment, USC Provost Michael Quick responded by emphasizing the University’s need to continually press on toward a more inclusive environment and to engage in thoughtful discussion on these issues. 
However, the movement and the HBF’s popularity among intellectuals declined in the 1930s with increased opposition to Germany’s racist and religious policies, according to Spicer.
Still president during this tumultuous, historical time, Von KleinSmid denounced Germany’s policies upon returning from a trip to Europe. 
“The edicts against the Jews in Germany are as terrible as they can be,” Von KleinSmid said in a memo sent from the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “This non-Aryan persecution affects even the higher institutions of learning and the program is rigorous almost beyond expression.” The memo noted that his statement was surprising, due to the HBF’s ties with German officials.
However, the eugenicist agenda lingered until 1979, when California repealed its sterilization law. From 1909 until 1979, California performed approximately 20,000 forced sterilizations on its citizens. Madrigal v. Quilligan, a controversial lawsuit, arose out of 10 sterilizations of Latina women at the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Hospital in the early 1970s. 
Although administrative officials did not play a part in the doctoral decisions that unwillfully sterilized the Latina women represented, these events harken back to the ideologies of the time. The Madrigal case ruled in favor of the doctors at the hospital. 
Von KleinSmid’s contributions to the University’s history is multifaceted and complex: It is one full of accomplishments, but also of controversial ideologies that conflict with USC’s present message of diversity and inclusion. 
“Under Von KleinSmid, there was a lot of growth, which included the establishment of additional professional schools and colleges and the expansion of the student body and the physical campus that is USC today,” said Claude Zachary, the University Archivist. 
According to documents from the University archives, during Von KleinSmid’s administration, USC expanded from eight colleges to 26, with the creation of a school for international relations and development of the first cinematic arts school in the U.S.
The University became nationally accredited and expanded its international outreach, with international students comprising 10 percent of the student body. Von KleinSmid also developed a scholarship program for foreign students who were to return to their homes after their studies and implement their skills to better their countries. 
Despite his accomplishments as an internationalist, there was historical evidence of Von KleinSmid’s hostility toward Japanese Americans. In a book titled From Concentration Camp to Campus: Japanese American Students and World War II, Von KleinSmid was described as “openly hostile” to Japanese American students and denied their requested transcripts in the aftermath of the war.  
In 1946, Von KleinSmid stepped down as president to become chancellor of USC, a role that he would take on until his death on July 9, 1964. In 1966, the Von KleinSmid Center for International and Public Affairs was dedicated to the former president. 
Von KleinSmid was a prominent intellectual figure who held a variety of viewpoints across his lifetime. Von KleinSmid’s leadership helped shape USC’s present-day image through various educational and structural developments, and while he is remembered as an internationalist and an influential educator, his history as a eugenicist and a co-founder of the Human Betterment Foundation still exists to reflect contentious ideologies. 
“With every generation, there is a need to recommit to the ideals of what it means to live in a democracy, what it means to enact equality and what it means to be an engaged citizen,” Quick said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Such actions bring us a little closer to the ideals we all envision, as the standards for what is acceptable and what is no longer tolerable evolve … USC must grapple with these issues as well, but we should do so in a way that all universities should — with an examination of the facts, with thoughtful reflection and with rigorous debate. And, most importantly, with a commitment to fundamental values — we stand against hate and racism; we stand for inclusion, respect and the appreciation of differences.”
 
This article has been updated to include the correct dates of President von KleinSmid’s death and the dedication of the VKC building. A previous version stated that von KleinSmid died in 1955, and the building was dedicated two decades later. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

The USC campus is at its best. The shrubs are manicured, the unblemished cardinal and gold flowers line the planters of Alumni Park, and thousands of white folding chairs line the grass outside Doheny Memorial Library. It’s showtime. 
A sea of black gowns flood into the ceremony. Underneath the caps are mostly faces freshly into their 20s. There’s a frenetic energy in the air as the youth of yesterday transition into the adults of tomorrow. 
All of the graduates find their seats, while Miller Fong waits inside the grand behemoth at the center of campus, Bovard Auditorium. Except he’s not in a cap and gown. He wears a letterman jacket from his days as a USC tennis player that is more than double the age of most of the graduates in the crowd. Peeking out from underneath the deep red of the jacket is a USC-themed tie. 
It’s finally time. Fong begins the procession from Bovard Auditorium, across Trousdale Parkway and through the sea of caps and tassels. As soon as the walk starts, a roar begins to build from the crowd. One by one the black gowns rise in welcoming Fong along this sacred walk that all USC students take twice in their careers — once at convocation and once at commencement. However, Fong made this walk last year. And the year before. And the year before. Oh, and 50 years before that, on June 11, 1964. 
Fong is one of a few dozen Half-Century Trojans at commencement. Every year, alumni who attended USC 50 or more years ago are honored at the ceremony for their commitment to the University and their upholding the Trojan legacy. 
But for Fong, something is different about this year. As he makes his way through the crowd of students, stopping to high-five and shake hands with them as he goes, he throws up a “Fight On” sign, smiling so big his whole face is enveloped in the grin. He looks around, sees his family who came to support him, but is looking for one face in particular. He scans the crowd until he sees her, his granddaughter: Brynn. 
“She saw me walk by and she was waving,” Fong said, shaking his head at the memory.
Today, they aren’t a grandfather and granddaughter separated by more than five decades. Today, they are just two Trojans joined together in celebration of each other and the university they love.
That’s the beauty of the Half-Century Trojan program, says Tanya Moran, associate director of generational programs. 
“When they tell me their stories about the ’60s and the ’70s and how much they love this school, you really feel it,” Moran said. “You really, really feel it.”
Fong, the son of Chinese immigrants, grew up in downtown Los Angeles in the 1950s. He was born in the back of his parents’ antique shop, just a few blocks from USC, and grew up helping them maintain it. Fong said it was his father’s dream that he attend the USC architecture school. 
In 1959, the acceptance came. 
“He promised — he said if I got into the school of architecture, he would dance in the streets the day that I graduated, and he danced in the streets that day.” Fong said. 
Fong said at USC he was one of “only a few Asian kids” in the architecture program. He worked through college at his parents’ store to afford the $1,000 USC charged for tuition each year. 
Fong would graduate in 1964 and go on to become a successful architect, returning to the University 12 years ago as an adjunct faculty member in the architecture school. One of his two daughters and two of his grandchildren attended USC after him. 
“It really makes you much more enthusiastic about the University,” Fong said. “I mean that’s really true, you’re so proud of it, that you’re a part of that journey and how much it’s changed, and it does give you perspective.”
For Janet Tonkovich, her USC journey has spanned more than a century. Her grandmother graduated from USC in 1912, her parents followed suit in 1939, she and her sister graduated in the mid-1960s, respectively, and all three of her children went on to receive a USC diploma. She even was able to walk in the Half-Century Trojan graduation procession with her mother, who lived to be 100. 
“I didn’t want to leave,” Tonkovich says of her time at USC. “I kept finding reasons to stay.”
Tonkovich was a physical education major with a specialization in dance. Fifty years before the groundbreaking of the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, there were just seven women at USC regularly taking dance classes with a piano accompaniment. 
The women learned all styles of dance, mostly with each other, but Tonkovich recalls one instance in which the broad, heavy-set football players joined in on a ballet workshop.
“That was pretty hilarious, standing at the barre doing our ballet technique with football players trying to do the same thing,” Tonkovich said with a laugh. “That didn’t last too long, because I don’t think the guys liked it.”
Back in the ’60s, USC enforced a strict dress code for women: nylon stockings, dresses instead of pants and closed-toe shoes. For a dance major, this posed a problem. Leotards and tights don’t exactly fit the dress code, and a wrong wardrobe decision could lead to women’s judicial proceedings, Tonkovich remembers.
“My grandmother made me this sort of shift, but it looked like a jumper,” Tonkovich said. “So if I wore my leotard and tights and just slipped on this jumper she made, it was easy to dash across campus really fast without anyone seeing that I didn’t have nylon stockings on.”
Tonkovich reminisces about her time at USC fondly, but has experienced a whole different side of USC as an alumna. As an undergraduate, she was convinced she knew everyone on campus, but she said the alumni involvements — including Troy Camp, Interfraternity boards, Trojan Guild of Orange County and Half-Century Trojans, among others — have allowed her to meet alumni and friends who she was never able to as a student.
According to Half-Century Trojan President Jim Childs, this is the goal he has for the organization: to bring alumni back home. 
“You can stay involved with this University for 50 years or more and still enjoy it, still find it stimulating and fun and interesting,” Childs said.
Childs, an upstate New York native, says his love for USC began not when he stepped foot on campus, but as a child watching the USC vs. UCLA football game on national television during Thanksgiving weekend. 
“You’d be sitting there freezing in Syracuse, New York, looking at this guy riding a horse into the Coliseum — that was pretty amazing,” Childs said. “And it was always in the back of my mind.”
Childs studied finance at USC before pursuing a career in law. He met his wife on campus when the two had a night class together. Childs has three children and a grandson who have all attended USC.
But more than the family connections, it’s about giving back to the University that has given him so much. 
Similarly, for Wilma Pinder, the Half-Century Trojan experience breathed new life into her love and appreciation for USC. Though she credits USC as being the foundation for her nearly 30-year legal career, she said she was not as involved in University life until her 50th reunion.
“It was like I became a freshman in college all over again,” Pinder said of the reunion.
After graduating from USC in 1962, she said a class she took as an undergraduate — “Law for the Non-Lawyer” — lingered in the back of her mind for nearly a decade before she made the decision to attend law school.
She would go onto become the assistant city attorney of Los Angeles.
Now retired, she serves as a board member for the Half-Century Trojans. After all these years, she says she will still go up to people in public with USC gear and give them the “Fight On” sign — a phenomenon that Pinder says she does not experience with her two other alma maters from which she received her master’s and law degrees. 
“It always had the attitude of looking out for the student well after the first degree,” Pinder said.
And the Half-Century Trojans want to continue its legacy of supporting students. The organization offered 19 $10,000 scholarships to descendants of USC alumni in this past year. In addition, the program attempts to engage alumni to return to campus and see the change that has amassed in the last five decades. From attending performances at individual schools to campus tours to museum nights at the Fisher Museum of Art, the group provides a social haven for a group of former classmates who share a love for their university. 
“There’s something special about connecting with people that just understand you,” Moran said of the program.

Grouplove, the band famous for its anthemic, rock-pop singles, has added a brand new opener to its previously released LP, Big Mess. The album, which was originally released in 2016, attempted to build on Grouplove’s signature joyous sound — this time with the divergent undertone of looming parenthood and responsibility.
“Remember That Night,” the album’s new opener, is a nostalgic pop-synth track that makes listeners want to let go of love just so they can miss it. A sure hit among recovering broken hearts, the song manages to eclipse its generic context and trite one-liners (“Am I stupid or do I want you back?”) with a snappy chorus and tender opening that practically drips off singer Christian Zucconi’s forlorn vocals. 
“I’m feeling like it’s only the lonely who know we are,” he yowls, calling listeners to unite in their angst as well as dance with it.
“Welcome to Your Life” and “Do You Love Someone” are generic indie rock songs that fail to stray from Grouplove’s snarly sound, but nevertheless inspire an enthusiastic dashboard tap. “Standing in the Sun” feels meaningless despite a smattering of engaging lyrics (“God says it’s kind of hard to believe him”) that find themselves buried under an overworked melody. Tracks like “Enlighten Me” and “Good Morning” are catchy but boring  — their significance requires focus beyond the pre-chorus, which demands too much attention from listeners.
However, the second half of the LP offers a welcome and novel honesty that the first half seems to belie. “Spinning” sees Zucconi and Hannah Hooper’s voices interweaved into a promising dialogue with brave declarations of hopelessness: “It’s like I found my only child gone missing.” In comparison,  “Cannonball” bursts with ceaseless confidence that has the pair wrestling with the guitars for center stage.
One of the record’s highlights, “Traumatized,” begins with a poetically simple sentiment of devotion: “She is my only one true love in the world!” Zucconi disclosed that the track was written about his then-pregnant partner, Hooper. With glaring ’90s influences and an earnest amalgam of fear and anticipation of an oncoming change, the track could have easily been the album opener. 
Grouplove continues its streak of charged love songs with “Heart of Mine,” a proposal of partnership lead by Zucconi’s thrilling voice that manages to convey both the feelings of desperation and endless hope that often come with companionship. The band’s signature levity returns with “Don’t Stop Making It Happen,” an upbeat track with a head-banging percussion and prevailing joie de vivre.
In “Hollywood,” the LP’s closing track, the word “tired” sounds gorgeous and real in a stripped down number that Zucconi and Hooper truly make their own. The track conveys the authority with which exhaustion can seize one’s emotional reserves, highlighting the profound contemplation beneath Grouplove’s popular sound. 
“I’m more than just a memory,” cries Zucconi to Hollywood, coming full circle to his dismissal of an old flame as “something of a memory” in “Remember That Night.” The contradiction brings listeners back to the big mess that is love, companionship and musical artistry. 
Flaws aside, Big Mess finishes as a meditation on what listeners can assume to be the artist’s process — from exhaustion to celebration, big mess to little mess and love to memory.

Beginning Fall 2018, the USC School of Dramatic Arts will offer a new bachelor’s degree in contemporary musical theatre in conjunction with the Thornton School of Music and the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance.
“With its proud track record of Broadway and Hollywood successes and professional partnerships in musical theatre, the School of Dramatic Arts is now committed to leading the field forward with a BFA that promises extraordinary opportunities and breakthrough practitioner-based creative options,” Dean David Bridel said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
The interdisciplinary program aims to provide students with a foundation in acting, singing and dancing within a unique conservatory-styled curriculum. Students will have the opportunity to expand beyond basic, foundational courses through offered classes like digital entrepreneurship and on-screen musicals. 
During their junior and senior years, students will be able to take classes that emphasize the creative backstage aspects of theater production. These courses cater to writers, composers, lyricists, directors and choreographers in an effort to offer a more well-rounded musical theater education. 
The School of Dramatic Arts also boasts several successful alumni who have graduated from its performing arts programs, such as Hamilton star Renée Elise Goldsberry and Kinky Boots star Stark Sands. However, this is the first time the University will offer a contemporary musical theatre degree with an interdisciplinary focus.
According to Delphine Vasko, assistant dean of communications at SDA, USC hopes to effectively prepare its students for an innovative and expanding industry as contemporary theater continues to grow.
“We are in a new golden age of contemporary musicals, illustrated by the off-the-radar successes of new works like stage’s Hamilton, television’s Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and musical hits across all mediums of entertainment,” Vasko said.
According to Playbill, award-winning musicals like Hamilton  and Rent, which feature contemporary music genres like pop, rock and rap, have contributed to contemporary theater’s rise in popularity.
In shaping its curriculum with a changing industry, SDA relied on an interdisciplinary partnership with the Thornton and Kaufman schools to allow for creative collaboration among students of all talents interested in musical theater.
“[Students] will have the option to complement their core studies with focused classes … allowing for culminations in brand new musicals created by members of the cohort,” Vasko said.
Furthermore, SDA has also created programs to help integrate students into the musical industry, with the launch of LiveRead@SDA. The program provides opportunities for students to collaborate with industry leaders to understand how to bring musicals toward commercial production.

Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
The Joint Educational Project is launching a new eight-week volunteer program called “Understanding Homelessness through Service” as part of the USC Initiative to Eliminate Homelessness, which was introduced in April 2016.
In its pilot semester, the program will connect students to local nonprofits that work directly with homeless populations. 
According to JEP Program Assistant and graduate student Riley Runburg, JEP hopes to provide students with a community perspective while doing its part to contribute to the University’s homeless initiative. 
“USC students can spend their time volunteering at one of our organizations and leave with a new perspective — an understanding of the problems that go on in an urban area and having a little bit of empathy,“ Runburg said. “They can contribute to solving these kinds of social problems [like homelessness].”
JEP will partner with local community nonprofits to enact these social changes throughout the eight-week program. For example, it will work with Chrysalis, an organization that provides adults with resources to find and retain employment, and School on Wheels, a group that offers tutoring services and basic job training for school-age homeless children. In addition, JEP students will volunteer at local homeless shelters and public libraries.  
Students who participate in the program will work with JEP and the nonprofits for two hours per week, where they will directly provide services to local homeless populations and learn about the social problems these populations face. 
While the first semester will focus on volunteer programs alone, Runburg and JEP Associate Director Susan Harris are working to expand the project in coming semesters. 
Runberg and Harris are currently working with USC’s Thematic Option program to develop a course about understanding homelessness that will include service learning volunteer projects in its curriculum. While it isn’t confirmed, they hope to debut the program in spring, Harris said.
In 2015, Provost Michael Quick addressed homelessness as a “wicked problem” faced by society in a university-wide email. Since then, the University has sought to tackle the issue through the development of a committee consisting of six USC deans and the establishment of community housing resources.
“Homelessness, as we know, is an intractable problem that has reached epidemic proportions in Los Angeles,” Quick said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We also know that it is not an easy problem to solve. It takes a major university like USC to research, support and develop new ways to address this complex issue.”
According to Brenda Wiewel, director of the USC Initiative to End Homelessness, the JEP program is part of USC’s pipeline strategy to provide essential skills for individuals to enter and maintain a place in the workforce. 
“[The USC Initiative is] engaging students through volunteer work, internships and job placement to help build and fill the pipeline of jobs that are required to increase housing stock and provide services that place people into housing,” Wiewel said.
Students interested in the program can visit the JEP House, located at the corner of Trousdale Parkway and West 34th Street between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. until Sept. 1 to sign up for the program’s inaugural semester. 
“We know we need to come at [homelessness] from different directions and one of those is to engage our undergraduates. The JEP effort is a service program that will do just that,” Quick said. “Let’s put our brightest minds to this issue — students, faculty and staff — to further our mission of a private university that serves the public good.”

USC professor emeritus Paul Ilie, an expert in European history and Spanish literature, died on July 18 in Los Angeles. He was 84 years old.
Ilie is best remembered for his passion for intellectual engagement, his ability to genuinely communicate with people and his dedication to independent thought, according to USC News.
Ilie graduated from Brown University with master’s and doctoral degrees in romance languages and literatures. He then taught at the University of Michigan, Hebrew University of Jerusalem and UCLA.=
Ilie joined the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 1982 and taught for 15 years before retiring as a professor emeritus in 1997. Aside from teaching, Ilie wrote over 100 academic articles and literary criticisms, authored eight books and received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1965 to expand his research in Spanish and Portuguese literature.
Shortly before his death, Ilie had been working on a novel concerning the 17th century Spanish King Felipe V. 
Jesús Torrecilla, a Spanish literature professor at UCLA and former doctoral student of Ilie’s, expressed the gratitude and admiration he felt for Paul Ilie. 
“It is hard for me to convey the deep sense of gratitude I have for Paul Ilie as a mentor and as a role model,” Torrecilla said to USC News. “I could not be the scholar and the person I am today without the influence of Paul. Because of this, I feel that even if he is sadly not around us anymore, he will continue to be with us always.”

Hundreds of students bearing carnations made their way through campus on Tuesday evening. 
Chanting, “The people united will never be divided” and “No hate, No KKK, No fascist USA,” they made their way from Hahn Plaza through Trousdale Parkway and Watt Way. 
The Peace Walk to Promote Love at USC was assembled by the Undergraduate Student Government and its various cultural assemblies, including the Latino Student Assembly, the Black Student Assembly, the International Student Assembly, the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment. 
In collaboration with over 200 other campuses across the nation, USG hosted the event in solidarity with those affected by the violence at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Va. 
One of the people injured was a USC student, Aubtin Heydari, who is currently recovering from his injuries after being struck by a vehicle at a counter protest to the white nationalist rally ten days ago.
USG President Austin Dunn had been in contact with other college student body presidents to prepare for the rally, according to Daniel Zhu, the senior director of communications for USG.
“[USG and the assemblies] really want to show support, mainly to show that our campus is not a place where we will tolerate hate,” Zhu said. “We want to show the community and other college campuses that we are here to support the students.”
Saphia Jackson, co-director of the Black Student Assembly, opened the event with a message of peace and unity to USC students.
”We are all here for each other, and this is one of the platforms to show that,” Jackson said. 
USG provided carnations for students to hold as a symbol of peace against the torches that KKK supporters and neo-Nazis carried at UVA during the “Unite the Right” rally that where much of the violence in Virginia began.
In an effort to increase USG’s activism and presence on campus, the organization has created a diversity branch that now includes a liaison for each student assembly, said Cindy Pineda, USG’s Co-Chief Diversity Officer.
“I think that something that we did not have was USG as an activist with a lot of issues or incidents that have occurred in the past years,” Pineda said. “So what [we] found was that we needed an actual platform where individuals that did not have that power, could [now] utilize and feel more comfortable to speak out.”
During the event, Karen Garcia, Executive Director for the Latino Student Assembly led a farmers clap that she said was a symbol of unity and peace. The United Farm Workers created the clap to unify Filipino and the Mexican workers during the farm workers’ rights movement of the 1960s. It represented the beating of the human heart and how all hearts sound in unity regardless of barriers. 
“We wanted students to know that there is a place for anyone that wanted to discuss any fears or any negative associations that they may have for the events occurred in Charlottesville,” Pineda said. “[We wanted to] recognize that a fellow Trojan has been injured, and if we don’t address it, it is something that goes ignored.” 
El Centro Chicano Director Billy Vela said there are many emotions surrounding the events that occurred and expressed how students may feel scared by the displays of hate and racism on a college campus. 
”I am really proud of our campus and [how] our students are out here on their second day of class,” Vela said. “To me, it indicated how important these issues are to them. Charlottesville and situations that have happened all this summer … continues to be a very challenging subject for our country.”
Eloisa Campuzano, a junior studying creative writing, participated in the peace walk because she believes that without the participation of other students of color, racism on college campuses will continue to persist. 
“The events in Charlottesville were really disheartening, especially as a student of color trying to pursue higher education,” Campuzano said. “You would think everyone at these institutions are educated but it shows that that is not enough, ignorance is really complex. As a person of color you are automatically political because our existence is pretty much a resistance. We really cannot move forward unless there is a collective push.”

Attorneys for former USC kicker Matt Boermeester are seeking to have his expulsion from the school overturned, filing a petition in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Aug. 11. 
Boermeester was suspended indefinitely from the football team in January following an alleged incident involving his girlfriend, Zoe Katz. He was expelled in July as a result of an investigation by the school’s Title IX office.
The petition names the University, along with Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry. It states that after getting french fries from McDonald’s around midnight on Jan. 21, Boermeester and Katz were “engaged in loud, consensual horseplay and laughing” in an alley near Katz’s home.
It states that another USC student walked past them to put his garbage in the dumpster and “walked back without ever turning his head towards the two of them.” When a second student who had witnessed the incident from a window approached Katz and asked if she was OK, Katz “said she was fine.”
According to the petition, Katz didn’t make a report to USC about Boermeester, but Tanner Smith, another student who was told about the incident, reported it to his father, Peter Smith, the men’s tennis coach. As an employee, Smith was required to report the incident to the Title IX office.
But attorneys for USC filed a court document last Friday that appeared to refute those accounts.
“Two male students who lived in the area observed the assault and confirmed that it was violent,” the statement said. 
The document, which refers to Katz as “Jane Roe,” alleges that Boermeester placed his hands around Katz’s neck and pushed her against a wall at least twice. It states that the other students spoke with Katz alone in her residence following the incident and asked her to stay in their apartment.
“[Katz] was crying, but stated she would return to her apartment because she did not want to ‘make [Boermeester] more mad,’” the filing stated.
The document goes on to state that Katz would often report bruises on her legs and arms because Boermeester would “hit her or grab her tightly when he was angry.”
But Katz did not want to “burn” Boermeester because she still cared about him, according to the court filing.
“[Katz] noted that [Boermeester] was ‘very good at making [her] feel like [she] need[ed] him,’ and had torn her down so she felt dependent on him,” the USC filing said.
Katz was also allegedly concerned that Boermeester would find out that she made a statement to the Title IX office. 
“He can’t know I made a statement. Can you not tell him I made a statement,” she texted the Title IX investigator, according to the filing. 
In another apparent text exchange before the Title IX office notified Boermeester of the investigation, Katz texted the investigator that she had been seeing Boermeester at school and that they were on “fine tems.”
“I just act normal so he doesn’t [get] suspicious,” Katz texted. “Like most of the time we act totally fine even like friends like there haven’t been any problems.”
The filing claims that the alleged assault was captured by a surveillance camera near the location of the incident. 
Though Katz released a letter through her attorney last month refuting claims that Boermeester assaulted her and claiming that the Title IX office treated her and Boermeester unfairly, the University responded with a statement in the filing.
“[Katz’s] later denials were contradicted by her own initial statements to [the Title IX investigator], as well as the weight of the evidence collected during the investigation, including text messages among [Katz] and her friends, eye witness accounts, witness statements … and a surveillance video,” the filing stated.
According the filing, Katz’s attempts to protect Boermeester “may be motivated by love or fear of reprisal.”
Boermeester was two classes shy of graduating before being suspended, Katz said in her letter. The former kicker was the Rose Bowl hero for the Trojans in January, making the game-winning field goal as time expired to beat Penn State.

Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
USC football returned to the practice field on Tuesday after an intrasquad scrimmage on Saturday. With the Sept. 2nd season opener against Western Michigan approaching, head coach Clay Helton said that the team will go through a mock game week and that the team is preparing as if “they’re playing Saturday.” The Trojans have already started planning for the Broncos and will have a scrimmage on Saturday closed to the media. 
Team Captains 
The Trojans announced their captains for the 2017 season. Sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold, senior safety Chris Hawkins, senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu and junior linebacker Cam Smith will all don the “C” this season. 
Although the team usually votes for two offensive captains and two defensive captains, this year will be an exception. 
“It speaks volumes to what they’ve done in the offseason and what they’ve done for this football team,” Helton said. “I’m very proud of each one and the way they’ve led our football team on and off the field. I can’t think of four better men to take us into the 2017 season.” 
Building Chemistry 
One of the biggest storylines is who will emerge as the main targets for Darnold. While the Trojans undoubtedly have talent at the position, it is clear that chemistry needs to be built between the Heisman-candidate quarterback and his receivers. 
“We’ve still got work to do,” Helton said. “I don’t think we’re anywhere near a finished product. We’ve got two weeks to iron out those wrinkles and get the three to four guys who will go out and function on a consistent basis.” 
Helton singled out junior Deontay Burnett, senior Steven Mitchell and junior Jalen Greene for consistent and reliable play but he wants as much depth as he can get. He remains confident in his first group of wideout but aims to have six wideouts who can provide targets for Darnold this fall. Redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns has played well in recent weeks, but as the week goes on, the picture will become clearer. 
Freshmen Look to Contribute 
After getting a top five recruiting class in 2017, the Trojans hope to see major production out of their freshman class. So far it looks likely. Darnold mentioned that physically, the freshmen don’t look like 18- and 19-year-olds. 
“It’s good to see,” Darnold said. “A lot of talent and they’re picking up the stuff pretty quick.” 
Defensive lineman Marlon Tuipulotu, who was an early enrollee, stood out in Spring Camp and figures to be a rotational player who can stuff the run. Running back Stephen Carr said he’s adjusted to the speed of college play well. 
“My first couple of scrimmages, it was different,” Carr said. “One of the things I experienced was that you can’t spend too much time chattering your feet or making too many moves in the hole.” 
Although junior Ronald Jones II is the starter, Carr’s size and speed make him a threat in the backfield. 
Other Notes 
Freshman safety Isaiah Pola Mao will miss the rest of the season after suffering a shoulder injury in the scrimmage on Saturday.
Helton will name a depth chart on Sunday.
Senior offensive lineman Viane Talamaivao left practice early. Helton said the took a precautionary x-ray and it came back negative. Helton expects Talamaivao to return in a couple days.
Tight ends Daniel Imatorbhebhe and Josh Falo returned to practice today.

Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
The last vestiges of summer are slipping away, with school and classes back in session. Welcome Week is winding to a close as well, as students try to figure out their new schedules and begin settling back into campus life. Here’s a brief recap of what took place. 
Move-In Day
Wednesday was the designated campus-wide move-in day, ushering in a veritable flurry of luggage, suitcases and moving bins. Thousands of bright-eyed, bushy-tailed freshmen arrived, teary parents in tow, along with considerably less fresh-faced sophomores, juniors and seniors. 
New Student Convocation
Bright and early Thursday morning, the new students donned black caps and robes and marched in a procession to the rousing tunes of the marching band in the middle of Alumni Park. President C. L. Max Nikias delivered his signature speech welcoming freshmen and promised a year filled with even more excitement and opportunities than the last.  
USC Village grand opening
Attendees of the convocation barely had time to process the moment before they were ushered to the new USC Village for its official grand opening. The indefatigable Spirit of Troy was there to mark the occasion, and a bevy of speakers were present to heap praise on the expansion. The highly anticipated Hecuba statue was also unveiled in a flurry of confetti and to a chorus of applause from spectators. 
SPARK!
Thursday was a busy day for USC Village, which subsequently hosted Visions and Voices’ signature kickoff event, SPARK! Spoken word poet Javon Johnson, stand up comedians Jessica Sele and Atsuko Okatsuka and L.A.-based band Chicano Batman tore up the stage as staff members doled out their trademark t-shirts and backpacks. This was the first year that SPARK! was held at an outdoor venue rather than Bovard Auditorium, but the performance appeared to go off without a single hitch.
Welcome Back Carnival and Concert
USC Concerts Committee turned McCarthy Quad into a rave Saturday night. DJ Drezo sent pulses skyrocketing with his thumping EDM beats, while Smino amazed the crowd with his smooth rap verses. Hyped-up students fist-pumped, jumped along to the beat and even tossed tortillas into the air at one point.
Explore L.A. 
Intrepid USC orientation advisers led several expeditions across Los Angeles, allowing the new students a chance to discover the delights of a dizzying new landscape. Locations included Culver City, Olvera Street & Union Station, Grand Central Market, Universal City Walk, Little Tokyo & the Arts District, the Hollywood Walk of Fame and two trips to Santa Monica. Free Metro fare was provided and the students eagerly took advantage of the opportunity to freely roam and explore for a few hours. 
Welcome Back Comedy Show
USC Special Events Committee saw summer off with some laughs with their annual comedy show on Sunday night. Master of ceremonies Sam Tripoli, opening act Jamar Neighbors and headliner Tiffany Haddish each took a turn on the mic and managed to cheer up students depressed at the prospect of returning to the daily grind the next day.

Daily Trojan File Photo
The best game I’ve ever experienced as a sports reporter was an NCAA championship final.
I’ve covered my fair share of games — college and professional football, MLS and U.S. national team soccer, Major League Baseball. I’m used to the glitz and glamor of high-stakes games chock full of talent, and the roaring crowds that come with them. Even the Phillies, in all of their 45-77 glory, scrapped together nearly 30,000 fans for each game that I covered as an intern this summer.
But the greatest game I’ve ever covered took place last fall in front of a small crowd that barely topped out at a total of 6,000. It was the first weekend of last December and the USC women’s soccer team, despite low preseason rankings and several fumbling early season performances, was about to go all the way.
I like to brag that I predicted the Trojans’ dark horse run to the NCAA final months in advance. When the team knocked off a powerhouse North Carolina program in a dominant September victory, I started to write that the team was showing the razzle dazzle necessary to make it to the NCAA playoffs. 
Several months later, when the team entered the Sweet Sixteen, I booked a hotel room for San Jose, where the College Cup would be hosted. To me, it wasn’t a risk. I knew the team would be playing in the finals.
So when I ended up in the press box of the Avaya Stadium, trying my best to keep from cheering as Katie Johnson knocked in a goal to put the team up 2-1, it felt like the season was coming full circle. Yet as joyful as the moment was, it was tainted by the scene in the stands.
Avaya Stadium isn’t massive by any means — it’s an MLS stadium, built much smaller than other arenas — but the stands on half of the stadium were hardly full. The scattered handful of Trojan marching band members present overwhelmed most of the cheers throughout the 90 minutes of the championship game. 
A little ways down the road, Levi’s Stadium was sold out for the Pac-12 football championship game on the same night. I’m willing to bet that more USC fans watched that game — a boring 41-10 beatdown of Colorado at the hands of Washington — than the women’s soccer national championship, despite the fact that the Trojans weren’t featured at all in the night’s football game.
Weeks later, when the Trojans won the Rose Bowl, I could feel the Trojan spirit all the way from my couch in Kansas City where I was watching with my family. But on that night in San Jose, the half-empty stands made that classic USC cliche of the Trojan family hard to believe.
I know you’ve all bought into this year’s hype. I know that Sam Darnold’s No. 14 jersey is already pretty much sold out at the student store, and that perhaps too many fans already have January flights to Atlanta bookmarked on their computers. 
And I get it. I can’t wait for football season either. I’ve made far too many bets and boasting comments to back down from my belief that the Trojans could, and should, go all the way this year. But I’m also entering this fall excited for the prospect of the wide variety of other trophies that the Trojans could wrap up this year.
If there’s one thing that USC fans pride themselves on, it’s the intensity they bring to the stands. School spirit is crazy here, we always say, and Saturdays in the fall are holidays. But that’s often not the truth for teams that play every other day of the week.
I’ve been to USC women’s soccer games with less than 100 fans in the stands. Same with men’s water polo NCAA finals, and even men’s basketball games. When most Trojan fans say they have school spirit, they really mean that they have football spirit.
But this year, USC fans have reason to turn out for nearly every team. Men’s water polo, women’s soccer and football are all poised to vie for fall championship victories. There are squads throughout the seasons — from men’s basketball to lacrosse to track and field — that could be serious championship contenders.
So yes, pack the stands of the Coliseum on Saturdays for games. But also be there on Fridays and Sundays when the women’s soccer team looks to defend its national championship title. Be there for the teams who won’t get the College Gameday treatment, who won’t make the cover of Sports Illustrated or dominate primetime discussions on Sportscenter.
Football might be the highlight this fall, but that doesn’t mean other sports have to be relegated to a sideshow. There is plenty to be proud of when it comes to Trojan athletics. Don’t let the rising star of one championship-worthy team outshine the rest.

As of this month, California State University will no longer require incoming students to take math or English placement tests for college credit courses. Administrators will only take into account high school grades, Advanced Placement exam and SAT scores when deciding if students will have to take remedial classes or not.
When reading this news, USC students may think back to the summer before their freshman year when they were asked to take math and chemistry placement exams prior to orientation. These tests are only required for certain majors, but can be fairly extensive. In either case, many University students take math and science courses, so there is benefit to knowing what classes are at their level.
However, the problem is that the University notifies students of the existence of these exams in their email reminders to fill out the orientation checklist. With orientation slots spanning from early June to July, and the tests required to be taken more than a week in advance of orientation, the exams are never taken at an ideal time of year, and poor performances equate to an additional course load, which some students cannot afford.
If students have an early orientation, they need to take the tests in late May or early June. This time of year is when many high school seniors are coming out of AP and International Baccalaureate exams and still have finals and graduation requirements to worry about. Students already have a lot to do prior to graduation before they can start thinking about college. Fried brains and busy schedules make for poor test scores, which undercut the purpose of placement exams.
This situation is hardly amended by pushing the tests back. Students with later orientations are in the middle of summer vacation by the time their pre-orientation workload becomes a pressing issue. Students forget a large portion of the knowledge they attained over the school year while on summer break, and in subjects like math and chemistry — where they must remember advanced formulas —this can severely hamper placement scores. 
The language placement exams are open during orientation and Welcome Week. When students take the exams at this time, they are deprived of the fun and informative activities at orientation that can help them adjust to college life, as well as chances to meet new people. 
The solution is not to eliminate placement exams completely. Instead, USC should consider making them optional for the all students across all disciplines. Freshmen already have meetings with their academic advisors to devise schedule plans for registration. They could discuss the placement levels that the student’s high school grades, test scores earn them and determine whether or not they should take the exams to earn credit and test out of courses. And in addition to removing the requirement to take placement exams set up for failure, USC should offer a wider range of placement test-taking dates that give students better chances for success.
In college, students must learn to balance academics, social life, sleep, fitness and outside interests, and more universities are putting the power in their hands to do so. Deciding whether or not to take the placement exams is a freshman’s first taste of college responsibility, but it’s a choice that could do with guidance from an academic adviser. Taking end-of-the-year scores is beneficial in multiple ways. High schoolers study the entire year for the purpose of doing well on report cards and standardized exams. It only makes sense to evaluate the scores from the tests that the students are supposed to care about. 
Standardized testing is a constantly evolving system that always needs improvement, but discontinuing the use of mandatory placement exams could mark a step toward making the college transition a better experience for new students.

In July, the Department of Education proposed plans to amend current campus sexual assault policies and revise previous laws from the administration of President Barack Obama. Specifically, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is considering overturning the “preponderance of evidence” provision of the Obama administration, which effectively lowers the standard of evidence for individuals who report sexual assault.
As a result of this provision, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights required schools receiving federal funding to lower the standard of evidence for survivors. This decision acknowledged that the circumstances survivors emerge from can render it difficult to achieve the burden of proof necessary in other criminal proceedings. While proponents argue that the “preponderance of evidence” standard is useful in campus sexual assault cases where victims may face disbelief or blame upon reporting, critics of these guidelines say that this standard undermines the rights of the accused. This is especially evident when schools may be financially motivated to find alleged assailants guilty or lose crucial federal funding. 
DeVos’ tenure as Secretary of Education has so far been fraught with controversy, and whichever direction she chooses to go will no doubt draw more attention. But it’s important for advocates of survivors’ rights to acknowledge the validity of concerns about Obama-era guidelines and respect for due process.
Under the Obama-era “preponderance of evidence” standards, at schools that believe it’s even slightly more likely — perhaps a 50.1 percent chance — that an assault accusation is true, the defendant can be deemed guilty, despite the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in the criminal justice system. 
Obama’s tough stance on sexual assault brought an issue that had previously been swept under the rug into the national spotlight. Nonetheless, the guidelines served to disregard due process and the fundamental structure of our justice system: innocent until proven guilty. And over the years, these draconian rules have no doubt served to punish and ruin the lives of innocent students.
In the future, DeVos must be careful in choosing how she wishes to proceed with protecting the rights of the accused. On sexual assault, DeVos and her department already drew controversy when Candice Jackson, the deputy assistant secretary for strategic operations and outreach of the Office for Civil Rights claimed that “90 percent of sexual assault accusations fall into the category of ‘we were both drunk’ and ‘we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last [time] sleeping together was not quite right.’” These comments served to trivialize and dismiss sexual assault and led to protests outside the Department of Education. 
Moving forward from this controversy, DeVos and her department must tread carefully, and find a way to replace the preponderance of evidence provision with guidelines that respect the due process rights of students who have been accused without reinforcing harmful narratives and stereotypes about sexual assault survivors.
DeVos spent July meeting with groups representing individuals who had been falsely accused and faced severe consequences and trauma. Their input will be crucial to understanding why false convictions happen, and how we can prevent them. 
False reporting may not happen often; research has suggested that some 2 to 8 percent of sexual assault accusations are false. But when it does occur, for the wrongfully accused, the result is disastrous.
To move forward on reform, students from both sides of the spectrum — assault survivors and falsely accused students — must have a seat at the table.
At USC, like at all major institutions of higher education, sexual assault rates continue to be a concern.
Forty-one cases were reported in 2015 — a sharp increase from the 31 reported in 2014. While this increase could be because survivors feel more comfortable reporting assault than they previously did, it could also mean that sexual assault is occurring more often, which is a chilling concept. But simultaneously, it’s unclear whether the alleged perpetrators of any of these reported assaults were falsely accused. 
Though USC has taken admirable measures to combat and prevent assault from happening in the first place, preemptive strategies only go so far. A comprehensive, newly devised plan to deal with campus sexual assault needs to be enacted so that all students are protected, and both survivors and accused students are able to once again have confidence in their Title IX offices.
 
Why was my earlier comment deleted?
A few things to keep in mind.
1) The preponderance of evidence standard means you can be expelled for a crime you didn’t commit by 50% and a feather. Students lose the ability to continue their education as no other school will take them, not to mention the loss of reputation, and financial loss. (Both in paid tuition, meal plans, housing that isn’t refunded when you’re kicked out and future earnings because every school, graduate program and decent job will want to see your transcript)
2) The evidence standard isn’t the only thing that requires reform. Colleges often reach that while ignoring evidence favorable to the accuser, sometimes evidence that proves innocence such as text messages, witnesses, even DNA evidence. 
3) The training given colleges, sometimes only 5 hours, will explain that inconsistencies in the accusers statements or the fact that they waited months or even years to report, or that parts of what they say happened can be proven false is a result of trauma to the exclusion of all else. While there is validity in that in some cases, (Think of a domestic abuse victim who stays with their abuser) there are many other reasons to be considered. Yet they’re wholly disregarded. There was a case where a girl admitted she lied, he was still expelled.
The fact that there are more reports at USC may also be because the standards of evidence and lack of accountability and re definition of sexual assault have become so out of hand that things that you currently have a man expelled for domestic violence and the ‘victim’ has consistently said she wasn’t abused. This isn’t the only time this has happened. 
It’s unfair to say women lie about rape, but it’s very fair to say people often lie. Many colleges have no safeguards. There are no penalties for lying. Jackie from UVA of the Rolling Stone fiasco suffered no inquiry or sanction. 
Students wrongly expelled have no recourse but to sue, something which many simply can not afford. If a college like Amherst (Which has changed it’s policy after settling a lawsuit with an expelled student that the evidence showed was not only innocent, but was black out drunk when the sex act was performed on him) has a case like that, which took over 3 years from expulsion to settlement (26 months since the filing) how many other cases might be there? And from students that can’t afford that sort of legal action.
The most common theme in these lawsuits is the college insists it followed it’s procedure and stands by it’s expulsion. If the case survives a motion to dismiss, the next step is discovery where we would see the procedure and fairness. Colleges then quickly move to settle to avoid that. The question why should be asked. 
Those settlements are not only covered by insurance, but they also are covered by tuition by students paid before expulsion. They money settled is secret, but a recent report suggests the average is $187k which barely covers the legal costs for many. And it requires non disclosure agreements, so a student who had their name announced as a rapist can’t even point to a ruling that clears them. Students however will often take these because their lives are in limbo until they do. They can’t go on to another college. 
Suicidal thoughts are extremely common. Thomas Klocke took his own life for what could have been handled internally with no interruption of his education. Not only did he claim he was innocent, but his defense would have amounted to sexual harassment by the young man who accused him of typing something cruel on his laptop. Discovery so far has shown that the school suspended him from that class, the one he needed to graduate w/o hearing or explanation. Emails show they admitted to having nothing, yet they found against him, destroying his plan for graduate school. (He would have had to sue, settle and then return to take the class again to graduate. And even if the settlement had expunged his record, he would have to explain the gap in his education.)
Cases have included 3rd party accusations where the victim insists nothing done, too drunk to consent when the initiator of sex was the accuser and the accused was far more intoxicated. Students who could prove innocence, cases where students were denied knowing what they were charged with. Many cases where the real victim of actual sexual assault was the one expelled because they were the guy. And the list goes on.
Serious reform is needed. What is puzzling is why those who want to advocate protection don’t reach out and work with those who ask for fairness. Instead, their dismissed as rape apologists. The last OCR head refused to meet with them. 
Read some of the stories about young men who are ready to end their life because they thought the school would be fair, yet their set up to have to prove innocence, and have their feet tied behind their backs, and are cut off at the knees. They’re heartbreaking. 
And it seems like each day, there’s new one.
Since the ancient Trojans were slave holders isn’t it time to pull down Tommy Trojan and abandon the whole Trojan name and theme? If we get rid of confederate statues we should also hold USC to the same standard?
