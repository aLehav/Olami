After intercepting Arizona quarterback Nick Foles twice, junior safety T.J. McDonald was named the Lott IMPACT Player of the Week.
McDonald also had six tackles and recovered an onside kick to preserve USC’s 48-41 victory over Arizona on Saturday.
Good hands · T.J. McDonald recovered an onside kick Saturday. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan
McDonald, who was named a team captain this season, has earned a reputation as a hard-hitting, physically imposing defensive presence.
One area of concern for the USC defense heading into its matchup with Arizona was its inability to force turnovers. The Trojans defense ranked last in the Pac-12 with a turnover margin of minus-six.
Coming into the game, Foles had attempted 210 passes without throwing an interception.
The Lott IMPACT Trophy, named after Pro Football Hall of Fame member Ronnie Lott, is awarded to college football’s Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year. The award is given to the player who exhibits the same characteristics Lott personified during his career:  integrity, maturity, performance, academics, community and tenacity.
Lott, who played for USC and was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2002, is largely considered one of the best defensive college football players of all time.
McDonald also has family ties to Trojan football.
His father, Tim McDonald, was a two-time All-American at USC in 1985 and 1986 and a team captain.
He was named MVP of the 1985 team, which won the Rose Bowl. After USC, McDonald went on to have a successful 13-year career in the NFL.

On Monday, junior quarterback Matt Barkley received yet another accolade when he was named the Pac-12 Conference’s Offensive Player of the Week.
This is Barkley’s second Pac-12 Offense Player of the Week honor for Barkley this season.
After throwing for 324 yards and five touchdowns, with no interceptions, against Syracuse on Sept. 17, he received the honor as well.
It comes just days after his record-breaking 468 passing yards and five touchdowns (four passing and one rushing) helped pace the Trojans (4-1, 2-1) to a win over the Wildcats heading in to the bye week.
On the afternoon, Barkley also completed 32-of-39 passes and connected with sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods for a career-long 82-yard touchdown pass, the longest completion by USC since 2001.
USC has now won the Pac-12 Offense Player of the Week Award three times through the first five weeks, as Woods received the top honor following his 17-catch afternoon in week one against Minnesota.
In 2005, Reggie Bush, Matt Leinart and LenDale White combined to win the award a school-record five times.
Bush also remains the last Trojan to be named conference player of the week three times in a season.
Heading into the bye week, Barkley is fifth in the country in both passing yards (1,587) and touchdowns (15).

It was impossible not to be optimistic about USC’s defense coming into this season.
After all, the belief was that improvement was guaranteed — not because of a boost in experience, talent or coaching, but rather, because the 2011 defense couldn’t possibly be worse than the 2010 defense.
Porous · USC assistant coach Monte Kiffin’s defensive schemes have been subjected to increasing levels of criticism in recent weeks, as the Trojans are surrendering nearly 400 yards of total offense per game. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Last season, USC gave up an average of 400 yards per game, good enough to be tied with Duke for 83rd in the nation. Teams were scoring 26.4 points per game against the Trojans, and doing so mostly through the air — USC’s pass defense was ranked 100th in all of college football.
So with solid performances in weeks one and two, when the defense held the lead for the Trojans as the offense sputtered and died in the waning minutes of each game, it seemed as if the constant worry that pervaded last season was finally something to forget.
Flash-forward to week five, and it’s become clear that if anything is ready to be forgotten, it is the notion that stifling defense has returned to USC.
Arizona’s aerial thrashing of the Trojans last Saturday highlighted many of the consistent problems USC couldn’t seem to overcome a season ago.
The numbers are right there in the stat book — 554 yards of total offense for the Wildcats, led by a 425 yard, four-touchdown performance by quarterback Nick Foles. The senior captain spread the ball around to 12 different receivers, and completed 77 percent of his passes en route to putting up 41 points.
These are numbers that sound all too familiar for a Trojan unit that is supposed to have grown up.
Fortunately for USC, it was able to stay one step ahead of Arizona’s offense and eek out a 48-41 win. Coming against one of the worst defenses in the Football Bowl Subdivision, USC picked a good time to host a shootout.
But the same can’t be said for the 44-23 beatdown USC received from Arizona State in the desert two weeks ago.
USC gave up 141 yards rushing and three touchdowns to junior tailback Cameron Marshall, including a 70-yard score on ASU’s opening drive. Brock Osweiler, the mobile-yet-massive Sun Devils quarterback, also put up strong numbers, throwing for 223 yards and two touchdowns.
It didn’t help that the Trojans offense gave the ball away four times. But when USC was in desperate need of a stop, it simply couldn’t come up with one.
A simplified version of the defense the Trojans ran last season looked like a quick fix for this year’s team. But the pay-off hasn’t come yet, and USC has simply not been able to mobilize its defense. The Wildcats held possession for seven-and-a-half minutes longer than USC on Saturday, and the Sun Devils had an 11-minute advantage two weeks ago.
If you are asking why the defense has taken such a big step back from the beginning of the season to now, then you are asking the wrong question — the issue isn’t with USC’s defense necessarily.
Up until a run-in with the Arizona schools these last two weeks, the USC defense went largely untested. Once it had to face a well-coached spread offense (in both Arizona State and Arizona), holes opened up that the two teams had no problem exploiting.
It’s hard to contest the prowess of USC assistant coach Monte Kiffin, who is widely regarded as one of the great defensive minds in football today.
But time and time again it has become clear the current system is not working the way it is supposed to with the players that USC has on the field.
And now, with the meat of Pac-12 play on the horizon, the Trojans will surely be challenged as much, if not more on defense. It goes without saying that Stanford and Oregon have high-powered offenses, but even teams like Washington and California have proven they can light up the scoreboard.
Playing through the last two weeks will surely provide a lesson for the Trojans defense, as well as the coaching staff. But the same could be said about all of last season, which hasn’t been the stepping stone in the way the Trojans had hoped.
Until USC proves it can address its flaws and adapt to the offenses it is sure to encounter in 2011, there is a good chance Saturday’s shootout won’t be the last of its kind this year.

“It’s hard to contest the prowess of USC assistant coach Monte Kiffin, who is widely regarded as one of the great defensive minds in football today…”???  Puh-leeez!  This guy has taken the once proud Trojan defense and turned it into a laughing stock.  Daddy Kiffin was supposed to be one of reasons Boy Kiffin was hired.  They will both be remembered as among the worst coaches ever to walk the sidelines  at Troy.

The latest sports craze taking the world by storm really does not seem all that complicated to the untrained eye — you run around with a broom between your legs and throw a ball through some hoops.
In flight · USC, which is ranked No. 22 in the world by the International Quidditch Association, faced UCLA on Sunday outside Marks Hall. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
It’s simple enough that even a Muggle can play it. The sport, of course, is quidditch, the magical sport of J.K. Rowling’s popular Harry Potter series.
Though most would be content to just imagine what it’s like to fly on a broom, chase a small golden ball and throw balls at one another, students from all over the world are now playing quidditch exactly the way Harry Potter and his friends do (minus the flying).
There are 104 teams that are members of the International Quidditch Association and 100 participate in the Quidditch World Cup. USC’s team is ranked No. 22 in the world, according to the IQA.
Quidditch has seven players per side, including a keeper, who is a goalie of sorts, three chasers whose main job is to throw a ball (called a quaffle) through the hoops the keeper defends and two beaters who throw hard balls (called bludgers) at other players in order to prevent them from scoring goals. Then, of course, there is the seeker. The seeker’s job is to capture a tiny golden ball called the snitch. If caught, the game ends, and the team that catches the snitch is awarded 30 points. The team that has the most points after the snitch is caught wins.
Anyone who has seen a Harry Potter film knows most of this already. To see it in real life, however, is a different story. There are some noticeable differences: For one, as opposed to flying, players are simply forced to hold a broom between their legs at all times and sprint up and down the field.
Also, the snitch is not just a golden ball in the collegiate edition of quidditch: It is actually a person who runs around a selected portion of the campus dressed in yellow, holding a tennis ball hanging on a flag.
The snitch, according to the IQA, can use any means to avoid capture. He or she can “[use] wrestling takedowns or trickery like riding a bicycle, climbing trees or hiding in the audience.”
“When I was applying to schools, I noticed on [UCLA’s] website that they had a quidditch team and I thought, ‘Wow, that’s really cool,’” said UCLA student Brady Stanley, who served as the snitch during USC’s most recent game against UCLA on Sunday. “I’m a runner, I’m a dancer, I’m a black belt in kung-fu and I thought, ‘It would be awfully fun to be a snitch!’”
Catching the snitch means yanking a tennis ball on a sock out of the player’s pants.
The snitch, however, can run around a part of the campus or nearby arena outside the actual playing field.
The snitch is not the only one who must be in good shape: Teams consistently practice up to three times per week in order to attain peak performance.
“I have been playing quidditch myself for three, three and a half years,” USC captain Spencer Gold said. “I’ve been playing before quidditch was actually started here.”
Gold plays the beater position, throwing bludgers at opposing players as a sort of team defense.
“For me, it’s since evolved past the books,” Gold said. “Yeah, it’s still a fun and interesting aspect of it, but the sport itself is what really keeps me coming back.”
Those who think quidditch is easy are sorely mistaken; it gets as physical as any sport.
“If the game’s going to count for something, team’s are going to go all out,” Gold said. “It’s very physical. Because you have to hold a broom between your legs, it’s only one-handed tackle but you can [full-on] tackle if someone has the ball..”
Strategy also plays a key in the game and the sport is not played without aim, Gold said.
“I’d say there’s a lot of strategy involved,” he said. “There’s no one particular strategy to go with, but you have to consider who your other team is fielding … versus who you’re fielding, what are your strengths and weaknesses, where you position your beaters to defend your chasers when they’re trying to score. There’s a lot of thinking going on in the game.”
If participation at USC is any indication of the sport’s growth, an NBA lockout won’t hurt sports fans who think there’s nothing to watch in the late fall besides football: The Quidditch World Cup is coming to New York in November.
Yes, to the outside world, the sport can look rather odd at times and it gets a little physical out there, but that doesn’t stop people from playing.
“I think it’s a great sport and I think more people should be playing,” Gold said. “It’s a worldwide phenomenon.”
Please stop playing this on thr campus of my beloved school.  It is embarrassing.  Keep things like this over at UCLA.

For a program so accustomed to winning, it’s considerably painful when a 22-game winning streak lasting nearly 12 months is snapped. It’s even more painful when it comes by way of back-to-back losses.
The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team is now faced with this reality.
Regroup · USC senior goalie driver Joel Dennerley, pictured here on Sept. 24 against UC Irvine, recorded 21 saves against Stanford and UCLA in the SoCal tournament, but the Trojans were outdone in back-to-back games for the first time since October of last year. - Kevin Nguyen | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (9-2, 1-0) suffered their first loss since Oct. 16, 2010, Sunday to No. 4 Stanford by a score of 6-4 in the semifinals of the SoCal tournament in Long Beach, Calif. USC fell again to No. 2 UCLA hours later by a score of 7-6 in the tournament’s third-place game.
This marked the first time since 2002 that the Trojans will not carry the title of “SoCal tournament champions” for the remainder of the season, as the Cardinal went on to win the two-day event.
Faced with its first loss of the season, the Trojans struggled to bounce back against the Bruins in the third-place game.
Answering to UCLA’s initial goal, USC notched two of its own from sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie and senior Peter Kurzeka. Junior driver Tobias Preuss and sophomore utility Mace Rapsey also notched two goals in the first period, giving the Trojans a 4-2 lead.
But with only one goal in the second period from Rapsey, once again, USC lost some of its momentum, allowing UCLA to score two more goals, leaving the score 5-4 at the half.
“In the game against UCLA, Mace Rapsey was our best player and Toby [Preuss] had a good show, too,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “Mace’s performance was nice to see because he was a little sick and did not play as many minutes up north [in the NorCal tournament]. In this tournament he helped out offensively and defensively.”
Second half scoring issues, seen in the semifinal game as well, continued to plague the Trojans as they vied to defeat the Bruins, as things began to slip out of USC’s grasp at the onset of the third period.
“Those two games [Stanford and UCLA] were unusual for us because usually we are an excellent second half team,” Vavic said. “The reason we won so many games in the past is because we wore people down in the second half.”
Sophomore driver Nikola Vavic attempted to even the score for the Trojans after UCLA scored for the first time in the third, but the Bruins finished off the period with another goal, leaving the score 6-6 at the start of the fourth.
The Trojans lost nearly all steam in the fourth period, when a UCLA conversion on an early 6-on-5 advantage led to its narrow one-goal lead.
Unable to tie the game and force overtime, the Trojans failed to finish off a 6-on-5 of their own and left the Bruins victorious.
“I think defense was good but if you have a poor extra man performance we usually don’t win,” Jovan Vavic said. “The main reason was our 6-on-5; we have a way better offensive team than just 10 goals in two games. The NorCal tournament we finished out shots and this tournament we didn’t.”
In a rematch of the NorCal tournament semifinals, USC first faced the Cardinal on Sunday.  Though the Trojans bested Stanford 12-5 earlier this season, the Cardinal redeemed itself with a 6-4 victory.
USC came through with three goals in the first half, two from freshman driver Kostas Genidounias and one from Vavic. But the team only managed to notch one goal in the second half from senior driver Peter Kurzeka, as the Trojans were outscored 4-1 in the final two periods.
“Defensively we made some mistakes we have made in the past,” Dennerley said. “I think that’s an area we still need to keep improving upon. We had a good offensive weekend up at NorCal and this weekend our timing of passes just wasn’t there and that reflected in the scores.”
Initially, though, USC looked as if it would extend its tournament streak to nine years, following a 21-1 victory over No. 20 Pomona-Pitzer and an 11-5 win over No. 7 UC Irvine on Saturday. That morning against Pomona-Pitzer, the Trojans put on an offensive display, racking up 15 consecutive goals. USC continued its surge later that afternoon, as it had eight different players score against the Anteaters.
“Our defense in general was pretty good, especially 5-on-6 defense. That was excellent,”  Jovan Vavic said. “We stopped every extra man they had except for one time in the last two games. On our extra man, we went 1-4-13 and that was really a problem. We scored one goal out of 13 power plays.”
No matter how impressive its offensive numbers were on day one, however, the pair of losses Sunday overshadows USC’s early-season momentum.
“We underachieved this weekend,” senior goalie Joel Dennerley said. “We happened to secure some victories, but we had some tough losses on Sunday and we need to reassess things and bounce back quickly.”
USC will return home for a series of three games at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, hosting Long Beach State on Thursday at 5 p.m. followed by an exhibition match against Long Beach City College.
Tough Times Don’t Last……but Tough Trojan Teams DO!!!!  This is a major setback for our Super
Men’s Water Polo Team.  We know Stanford & Ucla will be there in the MPSF and in the MPFS Tourney in Westwood. Two of those teams will make the final FOUR in Berkeley. [DON’T COUNT Cal out]
Our 6 on 5 must do better than 1 for 13.  We have so much talent on this 3Peat Championship TEAM!!
I know Coach Jovan Vavic will have our team ready to stay on top.  We must avenge those losses in conference play. 
I remain supremely CONFIDENT!
FIGHT ON MIGHTY MEN OF TROY.  WE LOVE YOUR EFFORT & SKILL.
TAKE US TO THE 4TH CONSECUTIVE THRILL,
KEEP FIGHTING ON!

Comedian and musician Tim Minchin is coming to the United States for a stateside stop.
Dark humor · Tim Minchin presents a foreign sense of comedy, characterized by its sharp criticisms of religion, to U.S. audiences, hoping to embrace the focused group of interested fans he has accumulated. - Photo courtesy of Secret Service Publicity
“I’m incredibly lucky to have this career in three continents — Australia,” Minchin said. “Europe and North America. This whole American experiment is trying to reach out to the audience I have here. I’m not trying to get huge. I’ve just become aware that I have people that are interested in my material over here and want to reach them.”
Sharp criticisms of religion, expletives of a motley range of topics, condemnations of monotheism and the like; these are the interests that fuel the fire of the comedian and musician that is Tim Minchin.
With his disparate subject matter comes an eclectic crowd; his shows in the United Kingdom and Australia attract a rather diverse audience, ranging from elderly couples to young kids.
His content is not the only thing that’s eccentric. Minchin’s Jack Sparrow-esque eye make-up and teased red hair contrast his coattails and piano, enabling him to get away with controversial sayings, as he states with ease and confidence, “They might be shocked by a few bits, but I structure the show so they’ll enjoy it throughout.”
He does limit himself when he thinks jokes go too far. He stopped performing “Fat Children,” which cautions parents to not feed donuts to their obese children, after his first tour, in an attempt to avoid insensitivity.
“If I can’t justify a joke in my own moral sphere, I don’t do it,” Minchin said. “I can say ‘f**k the pope’ because it’s a self-justifying idea that makes a clear statement about the pope.”
Unlike some satirists, who focus on specific political events or people, Minchin focuses his content on more general taboos, such as religion. These generalities allow his material to be timeless and applicable to any situation. Some might call it strategy but Minchin simply sees it as “dumb luck.”
“Politics is like pop culture because it’s fleeting and impersonal and not particularly interesting to me,” Minchin said. “Unless you count cheese as pop culture, because I talk about cheese.”
Minchin now lives across the pond but hails from the land down under. He says viewers attend his American shows because his material deals with pursuing a naturalistic worldview.
“The main problem is they all know all my material and are rabid for more,” he said. “It’s really good fun.”
People were surprised when Minchin said he would start touring in the United States because they thought a U.S. audience would not appreciate his religious-based material.
“I said even if only 10 percent of Americans are godless, I bet there’s more if you scrape below the surface,” Minchin said. “These people are the people that will find me.”
As for his growing popularity, Minchin credits his presence in the United States to YouTube, where many fans were introduced to him through videos such as the animation of “Storm,” a beat poem that works as a manifesto for skepticism.
“Without YouTube I wouldn’t be touring America,” Minchin said. “It’s fantastic for me because it’s where people have found my work. I can attribute all my success in America from the Internet.”
Minchin acknowledged such success can be a double-edged sword for foreign entertainers because their material isn’t always available internationally.
“I can’t blame people if they torrent if I’m not providing an opportunity for them to buy it,” Minchin said.
He released his first Region 1 DVDs, which work in American DVD players, on Sept. 27, and they are now available for purchase online — evidence of Minchin attempting to be more internationally accessible.
Though Minchin has toured the United States before, he said this was the first time doing so without his wife, whom he’s been with for 20 years, or his two children.
“I’m not particularly happy on it, but there’s much worse things,” Minchin said. “I could be in the navy or a coal miner or an astronaut.”
Tickets are sold out for Minchin’s Los Angeles show Wednesday at Largo.
I saw Minchin on Paul Provenza’s “The Green Room” on Showtime and was really impressed (check him out on the season finale episode singing about brain “endorphines”). I like how he views the world from a rationalist’s perspective and and infuses his comedy with elements of the absurd. Hope to see much more of him in the future.

Don’t stop imagining / the day that you do is the day that you die, advises Youth Lagoon front man Trevor Powers, on a track called “Seventeen,” off his debut LP, The Year of Hibernation. The album’s personal lyrical content provokes nostalgia and reflections on life. But if the lyrics are introverted, this 22-year-old’s imaginative musical experience is without reservations.
Powers recorded The Year of Hibernation while attending Boise State, with the help of friend and guitarist Logan Hyde. The two have plans to play 29 shows throughout the United States.
Synthetic visionary · In its newest album, The Year of Hibernation, Youth Lagoon constructs a sentimental record that avoids typically sappy, overdone mantras, but still reinforces a path that hints at a hopeful future, creating a work with which many young listeners can relate. - Photo courtesy of Force Field PR
With the surrounding buzz and a two-record deal with Fat Possum Records, Powers dropped out of school to pursue music full time and as a result, the band has since garnered acclaim in the music world.
The album acts more as a crystallized journal of a growing soul than anything, and though at moments it teeters on the edge of melodrama, The Year of Hibernation never feels overdone. Fortunately for Youth Lagoon’s audience, listening to each song is effortless and never once does the listener feel forced to find something redeeming.
Youth Lagoon approaches the majority of the eight-song LP by beginning each song with dreamlike melodies and yearning lyrics. At a certain point in the tracks, the base and drums transform the daydream into a parabolic head-bobber, creating a catchy vibe that allows listeners to get into the rhythm. To fill out its sound, for example, Youth Lagoon doesn’t withhold from howling, whistling and clapping its way into your already tapping foot.
The opening track, “Posters,” prepares the listener for what to expect throughout the entire album. A resonating synth looms patiently in the background until the breakdown, where it attaches itself to a punchy drum in the first of many electronic detours. The first track seems to be a template, setting a specific tone and sound for a few of the other tracks on the album.
“Afternoon,” on the other hand, is inspired by the anxiety of not knowing if a loved one will be waiting when you return for them. It opens with a childlike synth that ripples through each measure as the sound slowly fattens and crescendos with tasteful whistling and a syncopated tambourine.
Powers and Hyde take their intriguing sound even further by forging a harmonious reciprocity between a picked electric guitar and a wheezing drum machine on “Cannons,” resulting in one of the more electronic tracks of the album, enrapturing listeners in its interesting beats and stand out sound.
Another electronic track, “Day Dream,” is the most overt in its electronic inclination, as seen with its pulsing synth overlaid with echoing vocals. A guitar solo steers the song into the deepest electronic experimentation on the album. This song is something of an anomaly on an album where most of the songs ascend slowly, but “Day Dream” stands as a testament to Youth Lagoon’s ability to produce more honest music.
As for popularity, the track that has received the most internet buzz is “Montana.” The song’s spine consists of pounding chords on a coarse sounding piano. Additionally, “Montana” feels like the culmination of all the emotions of the album, vacillating between the victorious and the wistful.
At times, the album can feel formulaic. But each track stands alone as a triumphant elegy for lost youth and a surefooted gaze toward the frightening future.
Despite the sense that the lyrics transcend the present, Youth Lagoon has no problem holding one’s attention and heart solidly in the moment. The elegiac parts that constitute The Year of Hibernation are less than revolutionary, but the beauty of this album is found in the synthesis of these parts.
The Year of Hibernation is currently available online and through Fat Possum Records.

Fitness trends come and go, often fading quickly as fads, but one trend that has emerged and actually picked up steam is barefoot running.
Easily noticeable thanks to their lack of shoes, or the minimalist footwear they sport, barefoot runners swear by the method as a healthier and more effective way to run. But is this really true, and should you make the switch and ditch the shoes? Quite possibly.
Barefoot running succeeds because it resolves the problems that come from running with shoes. For those who run in shoes, no matter their endurance level or skill, the style is always the same. The heel comes down first, with the forefoot hitting the ground soon after, before kicking off to continue.
When running barefoot, however, the forefront of the foot is what hits the ground first. This, along with the rotation of the ankle allowed from forefoot striking, moves weight off the leg, reducing the force of the impact on the body. Similarly, the forefoot continues to push off, maintaining running momentum and preventing the body from expending unnecessary energy.
The biggest problem with striking the ground with the heel is it puts an undue amount of stress on the foot. The angle of the leg, and the motion of the body when landing heel-first, puts more of the leg’s mass to a stop. For anyone trying to work on speed and maintaining momentum, this is counterintuitive.
Think back to Newton’s Second Law: Force is equal to mass times acceleration. The more mass affected when running, the more force is pushed through the foot, which can lead to stress injuries if continued over a long period of time. And when running with heel-strikes, this force hits not only the heel, but also the ankle, lower leg and knee.
And then there’s the fact that heel-first running can actually slow the body down. To protect against injury, most running shoes have elevated heels protected by thick padding. The problem is that, combined with heel strikes, these pads increase friction and slow down the runner. Add to this the directly downward force from this running style, and much momentum is lost through this method.
What is most interesting is the timing of the barefoot running craze. People have run barefoot for a long time — Abebe Bikila won the Olympic marathon in 1960 sans shoes — but until the last few years, it was not a major trend. Christopher McDougall’s book, Born to Run, probably had a hand in it, but the idea of a natural, injury-preventive way of running seemed to pass more through word of mouth than from any top-down attempt at emulating an athlete. Because of this, a small but close-knit community has built around barefoot running.
Those wanting to try out barefoot running, however, should be ready to ease back on the intensity and length of a run. Because forefoot striking utilizes different muscles; it will take time for your body to adjust and for your muscles to develop. Similarly, joints might be unprepared for the stress of this type of running. Your body will recalibrate balance, stance and muscular strength over time, but not instantly, which could lead to injury if you put too much stress on the body.
The best approach is to start off at an easier pace. If you tend to run two miles at a time, cut back to half a mile. This might seem frustrating, but it will allow your body to adjust to the new style and train your muscles to strengthen the front of the foot and the ankles. Going for an intense, long-distance, barefoot run for the first time might result on soreness and potential injuries.
Be careful when running barefoot. This is Downtown Los Angeles and pavement, rocks and the occasional path of broken glass can hurt. That’s why it is best to embrace minimalist footwear. These shoes don’t have a pad at the heel, fit very close to the shape of the foot and offer the minimum amount of protection so you can run around the city without shredding your feet.
Barefoot running is not the end-all, be-all solution for runners. But for those who want a more natural approach that works better in the long term, however, barefoot running can offer more speed and a new experience.

GOOD THING YOU’RE PRACTICING RUNNING, CAUSE YOU’VE BEEN RUNNING FROM OUR FIGHT ALL YEAR. YOU MIGHT BE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR HEEL STRIKING THE GROUND BUT YOU’LL HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS WHEN MY FIST IS STRIKING YOUR FACE. FITNESS TRENDS COME AND GO, GUNS IS FOREVER.
Two years ago I ditched my shoes and went barefoot. Within 2 months, my running injuries had disappeared (I stopped overstriding and pushing/pulling with my feet), and soon thereafter I had developed arches in my previously flat feet.
BTW, I’m not sure Newton’s 2nd law applies the way you describe. While mass and acceleration don’t change (you don’t lose weight while you’re in the air), but since a forefoot strike leads to using your legs/hips to absorb the shock, you dissipate the force in a VERY different way than if you heel-strike.
Oh, and while I do most of my running barefoot (except my competitive sprinting, when I’m in spikes), I spend all the rest of my time in running sandals from http://www.InvisibleShoe.com
I would also question, along with toomoon, the explanation, “the forefoot continues to push off…”   No! No! No!!!  You put undue strain on the calf muscles when you do that! Do not push off with your forefoot!  Lift your foot off the ground (or kick it back, depending on speed and surface angle). Forward momentum is maintained by the position of the upper body over the foot landing. Again, do not push off.  
Toomoon, that link you provided didn’t seem to give any evidence of the barefoot heel strike.  It wasn’t even a study. Did you get the link right?  In any case, heel striking for most barefooters should be avoided. Apparently, there are some who do it, but, in general, it’s a good way to damage the heel. I land midfoot and run barefoot most of the time (as long as there aren’t acorns all over my running route – I hate stepping on acorns barefoot!).
you need to download the ACE vibram study as a pdf.. it is in a little box to the right of the start of the article
Thanks, toomoon. I read the study. It was pretty weak as far as detailing all the possible factors including issues like hardness of running surface and what surfaces the vibram wearing runners ran on during their two week period. Plus, whether or not they were actually committed to switching form permanently was not mentioned.
In any case, you said “not true” to the fore foot argument of minimalist/barefoot running, and I think you are not being gracious by saying “not true.” Yes, it takes work to switch to midfoot running from heel strike. Is midfoot the same as forefoot? Not according to many. People who switch, of their own accord and through their own exercise of will, often will take the time to understand what needs to change and demonstrate the discipline to do the change. Is heel strike acceptable for barefoot running? Most likely not!! If it is done, it is a small minority and they still run very differently than the average cushy shoe wearing runner.
DON’T TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO DO, FOOL.
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GET GUNS AND STOP TALKING ABOUT YOUR BICEPS AND FISTS! I’LL GIVE YOU A GUN SHOW TO REMEMBER!
there are many mistruths, inaccuracies and assuptions in your article. For example
1.”For those who run in shoes, no matter their endurance level or skill, the style is always the same. The heel comes down first, with the forefoot hitting the ground soon after, before kicking off to continue.” This is compltely untrue.. there is as much variety in footstrike amongst those wearing shoes as those not. It is not only possible to be a midfoot or forefoot striker in a traditional running shoe, but many people run this way with absolute no issues.
2.”When running barefoot, however, the forefront of the foot is what hits the ground first.”… not true.. a recent study showed that of a cohort of 16 runners who changed from shod to barefoot, 50% still ran with a heel strike after 6 weeks of training. See http://www.acefitness.org/certifiednewsarticle/1641/
“This, along with the rotation of the ankle allowed from forefoot striking, moves weight off the leg, reducing the force of the impact on the body”  well.. for starters, the ankle is primarily a hinge joint and it does not rotate.. you have the wrong joint, I believe you mean the Subtalar joint. in addition, there is no evidence to support your statement.. at all! of course forefoot striking does not ‘move the weight off the body”. It eliminates the first peak of the vertical ground reaction force, but the effect of this is completely unknown and very argumentative, and almost certainly not related to injury. in addition, if you take the impact from one place.. you have to put it somewhere else.. in this case the forefoot, which probably bears a greatly incresed load, along with the achilles tendon and calf complex, in barefoot running. .. “Similarly, the forefoot continues to push off, maintaining running momentum and preventing the body from expending unnecessary energy.’.. errr can you please show me the evidence to suppport this statement??
i do not have the energy to comment on paragraphs 4-6 they are so shot full of errors.
3. “And then there’s the fact that heel-first running can actually slow the body down. To protect against injury, most running shoes have elevated heels protected by thick padding. The problem is that, combined with heel strikes, these pads increase friction and slow down the runner.” Do you really believe that forefoot striking eliminates the effect of friction?? ” Add to this the directly downward force from this running style, and much momentum is lost through this method.” nonsense.. there are many elite marathoners who run with a heel-toe action. Ryan Hall ran a 2.04 marathon and he achieves a heel strike.
4.”What is most interesting is the timing of the barefoot running craze. People have run barefoot for a long time — Abebe Bikila won the Olympic marathon in 1960 sans shoes — but until the last few years, it was not a major trend” .. that is right.. then he ran again in’64, wearing shoes, won, AND broke the world record. Was this due to shoes.. probably not.. was his win in “60 because he was barefoot? of course not.. this is the classic manipulation.
barefoot running is a tool to be used as a part of a balanced traing program.. just a running on trail should be or using a less structured shoe.. the so-called minimalist. if you are going to blog this stuff.. please get your facts straight!

Call it the Yips. It comes on quickly, without source or explanation. Steve Blass had it and was never the same. So did Chuck Knoblauch. Steve Sax caught it and somehow survived. 
What these names have in common is that they’re all baseball player names. “The Yips” is not so much a disease as the nickname given to the condition of talented athletes who are unable to do something they once did with ease — baseball players in particular.
Henry Skrimshander, of Chad Harbach’s wonderful new novel, The Art of Fielding, has an awful case of the Yips.
With the strength of his throws and the deftness of his glove, Henry makes for the perfect shortstop for the fictional Westish College, a small liberal arts school in Wisconsin, working together with Mike Schwartz, Westish’s hulking catcher and driven captain. Henry trains and refines his raw talent, which pays off midway through his third season when the Harpooners have a shot at the national title. That is, until Henry suddenly can’t make the throw to first base that he has made thousands of times before.
If this sounds like a tired story of athletic redemption, readers need not worry. In fact, The Art of Fielding is not really even a “baseball novel.” It’s a novel about growing up, specifically the kind of maturing that happens in college.
Harbach’s Westish recalls J.K. Rowling’s Hogwarts: Both are settings with personalities, places that define how their characters see the world in such an environment. Socrates’ quintessential question “How ought one to live?” becomes “How ought one to live here?” in these settings.
There is Guert Affenlight, class of ’71, a Melville scholar and Westish’s personable president who knows the first name of all 2,400 undergrads. There is Henry’s roommate and teammate Owen, a gay playwright who reads Kierkegaard in the dugout and whose status as a student-athlete is convincing only in the D-III world in which Westish plays. And there is Affenlight’s daughter, Pella, who comes to Westish to begin college at 23. A former artist and recovering manic-depressive, she is drawn to Mike, surprised at the nimble mind contained in his imposing presence.
Though college baseball touches all of their lives, it is really college to which they are committed.
These characters come alive in lucid prose that situates them without falling into cliché. For instance, the caring president fresh from the concession stand watches as a fastball nearly hits Owen and flinches in fear, “leaving fingerprints in his hotdog bun.” Owen, the brainy roommate lost in the beauty of a poem, sits with eyes closed, not asleep, “but like Sherlock Holmes at the opera, ears alert, a gentle smile on his lips.” Schwartz, the noble savage awakening next to a naked Pella, admires “the rolling coastline” of her legs.
This is exceptional writing. It provides enough detail to inform the reader of the characters’ feelings, but leaves enough out for the reader’s own experiences to magnify its meaning. Though you might never have crushed a hot dog in your hand, you know what it feels like to care for someone. You might never be a college president, but you know how it feels to be in a situation over which you have no control.
Henry, too, is consumed by and consumed with Westish, but in a different way. His immense talent and dedication shield him from hallmarks of the college experience — he rarely drinks, is befuddled by modern art and is that rare character in present-day fiction without a cell phone. For Henry, “the only life worth living was the unfree life,” the tireless repetition of practice and early-morning workouts.
This rigid asceticism sets Henry apart because it is so different from the modern conception of college — figuring out the world by having reduced expectations for a few years. Pick a major that interests you, hold off on a full-time job, explore your college town; these urgings would be at home in a brochure for USC or almost any other school. They would be almost meaningless for Henry.
And yet all the weights and wind sprints in the world can’t cure the Yips. As Henry notes, baseball players, unlike athletes in the “melee” sports of football and basketball, can’t be redeemed “through sheer desire.” They have to execute. After all, “What other sport not only kept a stat as cruel as the error, but posted it on the scoreboard for everyone to see?”

A satirical response to bans
Alan Wong (“Banning smoking is progressive,” Sept. 27) makes a counterintuitive argument about the proposal to ban smoking.
One might have thought sticking up for individual rights would be the progressive side of the debate rather than banning things that some people personally don’t like.
Wong is right that second-hand smoking is dangerous — he takes on the old canard that smoke (when outside) floats upwards: How many times have we seen innocent, young non-smokers surrounded by chain-smoking midgets at their feet, rendering them helpless to break free from the smog around them?
What good is the solace of the few, isolated remaining smoking areas when packs of crazed smokers pursue law-abiding DT journalists pushing their Virginian weed in their face?
My only wish is that Mr. Wong had taken his argument further! Why do we only care about smoking? A New York Times article (“Obesity Spreads to Friends, Study Concludes,” July 25, 2007) tells us that having fat friends can induce obesity even in those of us who are fighting it.
Where is the crusade to liquidate those people endangering our health so cruelly?
Unlike smokers, we even currently allow fat people to spread their virus indoors.
What would parents think if they came to campus and saw “heavy-boned” students waddling around campus without thought for the health of the rest of us?
I agree with Mr. Wong: “Banning fat people is progressive.”

The professional world is not segregated by gender. The era when adult men and women operated in separate spheres is at least 60 years behind us — right? So why is it that thousands of 17-year-old girls are no doubt sifting through scores of solicitation materials from colleges that only enroll females — in other words, colleges that are pretending such separation is not behind us at all?
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Granted, many of these institutions (and their lesser known and less common all-male counterparts) have great reputations, academically and socially, like Barnard, Bryn Mawr and Smith College to name a few. But how can these same institutions claim to fulfill the top criteria of a college education — to prepare people for their adult lives — when they openly deny their students access to a massive sector of that world’s population, one that offers a host of rich alternative perception, personality and creativity?
This idea is perhaps why a group of psychologists, child development specialists and a neuroscientist who specialize in gender have set out to prove just exactly why single-sex education doesn’t work. Their recently published study on this issue in the journal Science also set up the platform for the organization they founded together: the American Council of Coeducational Schooling. Headquartered at Arizona State University, the Council is the first organization dedicated to advocating for co-ed schooling as the best education for a co-ed world.
ACCES argues for coeducation well before the tertiary level. Members of the Council are fighting to eradicate what they see as a detriment to elementary, middle and high school students everywhere — the trend toward single-sex education in public schools. Such gender segregation has become much easier since the 2006 publishing of federal regulations facilitating single sex education in American public schools, a direct result of provisions made in the No Child Left Behind Act to embrace this practice as an innovative educational tool. Since then, according to the National Association for Single Sex Public Education, more than 500 public schools have incorporated single-sex classrooms at their facilities.
Proponents of this change tend to give three main reasons for their support: That it’s easier for students to focus when not distracted by members of the opposite sex, leading to better academic performance; that students at single-sex institutions, lacking social pressure from the opposite sex, feel more comfortable being themselves and pursuing their goals; and that single-sex education addresses the apparent differences between girls’ and boys’ learning styles.
This is all well and good — if you don’t happen to be an eight-year-old girl who despises arts and crafts or a boy that doesn’t like the rowdier style adapted by many teachers in all-male classrooms. And it’s great, too, if you ignore that consistent gender segregation could sometimes lead to serious discomfort and loss of self-confidence upon actually encountering members of the opposite sex, perhaps explaining why a 2005 study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development showed that girls in single-sex schools are more likely to develop eating disorders. And it tends to bode well for the future — as long as you don’t become so used to having that opposite sex “distraction” nipped in the bud that you’re shell-shocked and utterly incompetent once you leave the sheltered, gender specific universe.
If these effects sound bad for primary and secondary school students, consider how inexcusable they are at the college level. A 12-year-old who doesn’t know what to do with herself around boys is one thing; a college graduate who starts her first day on the job treating her male coworkers like aliens is quite another.
The fact that there are still single-sex colleges implies there is a sizable population of people not ready to face a world where men and women not only coexist as equals, but work together, share insight and enjoy the unique benefits that result from the synthesizing of their inevitably different social and biological backgrounds. Such synthesis benefits individuals and society in general. Men and women were meant to interact with one another — intellectually, socially and competitively.
Perhaps those who champion single-sex education on the basis of coeducation being “distracting” need to consider how this bizarre deviation from human interaction might be distracting to students itself.

The term “technology” is thrown around quite loosely. In terms of “technology” used in the classroom, we usually mean projectors, LCD screens, clickers and other electronic devices.
Esther Cheong | Daily Trojan
We should remember, though, that nearly any tool we use can be considered some form of technology. That includes books, pencils, blackboards and other traditional classroom items.
USC, among many other universities across the nation, has been implementing cutting edge technology such as projectors and smart boards. But USC should use technology only when it is appropriate and when it corresponds with the nature of the content being taught.
Technology in the classroom reflects an evolution not only of how teaching can be conducted, but also of the content students are expected to know.
By allowing students to access more information and at quicker speeds than ever before, the use of modern technology in the classroom pushes students to interact with technology in new ways.
A computer science major obviously must be competent with computers, just as a biology major must be proficient with many of the tools used in a lab.
USC gives students in technical fields, such as engineering and natural sciences, definite opportunities to exploit technology to succeed. The correspondence between the technologies employed and material presented is clear in the instances of technology-driven areas of study.
But whether the use of technology is appropriate in less technically driven fields of study, such as the humanities, is less clear.
Should USC push to make teachers of these classes employ the flashy multimedia presentations that business students might use or the clickers to count attendance and participation that many science classes use?
No, because USC professors should not be pushed in a direction that does not necessarily correspond to improvement. They should use technology only if it is appropriate. The implementation of technology is linked to the presentation of course content, and in altering one, one might negatively alter the other.
The presentation of information is as important as the information itself.
A delicate philosophical argument, for example, can perhaps be more easily explained with flashy diagrams and animations.
Similarly, in a language class, students given the option to type documents might more easily produce texts of greater length and more accurate spelling or character reproduction, but might fail to acquire a more solid grasp of the written language gained through hand-writing.
The implementation of new technology here can be seen as an impediment to a stronger foundation.
If a particular process is an integral part of learning, technology should not be employed in a way that would disturb this process.
Increasingly advanced technology allows professors to require more and more of students. USC should urge students to take advantage of technology to exploit opportunities that have been exclusive to the past few decades. The process of learning, though, should not be forgotten as a valuable learning experience in and of itself, and technology’s effects on this experience should be considered when its use is encouraged.
And though the implementation of different technologies might greatly alter how learning is done and what it is possible to learn, individual student intelligence and willpower still should be the primary determining factors in academic success at a university like USC.

It’s been a long time coming for rapper Jermaine Cole from Fayetteville, North Carolina.
After moving to New York City, attending St. John’s University on an academic scholarship and graduating with honors, he has released several mixtapes between 2007 and this album release, including one entitled The Warm Up, which Jay-Z got his hands on. After hearing the mixtape (and specifically a song called “Lights Please,” featured on this album), Jay-Z officially signed J. Cole as the first artist to his newly formed label Rocnation.
From there on out, the anticipation for J. Cole’s debut album has been building, even being called by some as the “savior of hip-hop.” J. Cole’s buzz has been skyrocketing to the top of the hip-hop world recently, even reaching into the ever-elusive mainstream audience. But did he stay true to the music that got him to this point and deliver the greatness that fans are expecting?
Simply put, yes.
J. Cole opens the album with himself telling his friends the story about the day he got signed, followed by a couple of bars that lead into the first real song on the album. “Dollar and a Dream III” is a follow-up to parts I and II off of his previous mixtapes, The Come Up and The Warm Up, respectively, which will satisfy long-time fans.
The difference between this song and its predecessors, however, lies in a much bigger and more epic sound, but Cole’s flow and deep lyricism shine still through (“Life at the bottom, nobody but God got em/They say he wouldn’t leave me, yet I’m fallin’ like it’s Autumn”). Easily one of the best welcome-to-the-album songs I’ve ever heard.
Following the struggle-orientated track, J. Cole lightens the mood on his second official single, “Can’t Get Enough.” Quite simply, it’s about a girl he, well, can’t get enough of. The beat is a great mix between “chill” and “party,” and Trigga Trey helps bring it all together on the hook.
Cole’s clever lyrics and confident delivery are what make the song work, with lines like “Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, man/Let you play with the stick, Ovechkin.” Somewhat new territory for Cole getting a Trey Songz feature, but this is a really catchy track that could possibly make some noise on radio soon.
Another great song on this album is “In The Morning,” originally released on the mixtape Friday Night Lights. It features J. Cole and Young Money’s Drake seducing their female friends.
Once you see the combination of J. Cole and Drake on the same track, you already know it’s going to be a hit. Cole kills his two verses (“Baby you summertime fine/I let you get on top, I be the underline, I’m/Tryna get beside you like the number 9, dime”), and Drake does just as well with his coarse-sounding vocals on the second verse. This song is strong all across the board. Over the piano-laced beat, this track easily lives up to the hype this collaboration brings.
Other standout tracks from the album include “Mr. Nice Watch,” a hip-hop/dub-step styled song that has J. Cole and his mentor Jay-Z sharing verses on the same song, and “Work Out,” which samples Kanye West’s “The New Workout Plan.” The song rumored to be the next single from the album, “Nobody’s Perfect,” has a sick beat produced by Cole himself and a nice guest feature from Missy Elliott singing on the hook.
J. Cole has truly created an album that suits every kind of hip-hop fan out there. Touching on topics from abortion to women to partying to just trying to make it, Cole has done everything to make sure his old fans are satisfied and his new fans are here to stay.
In addition, he produced nearly every song on this album and takes almost all the songwriting credit as well. His unique ability to produce his own beats that compliment his rapping perfectly is what makes him even more of a talent. If you are looking for a nearly flawless album that displays one major contributor to the very bright future of hip-hop, then look no further.

Penalties regarding teen ‘sexting’ in Florida have been reduced. The state law, first passed in June, prohibits teens from sending nude photos via phone. Beginning Oct. 1, changes have been made to penalties for violators of this law.
Under the earlier law, a teen caught sending nude photos or videos could have been charged with a felony and required to register as a sex offender.
Under the new law, the first offense is a non-criminal violation, accompanied by either eight hours of community service or a $60 fine. A second violation is a first-degree misdemeanor. The third offense is a felony, which could come with a prison sentence up to 5 years.
The law was originally designed to take into account advanced in technology in child pornography laws.
“(This bill) modernizes these laws to ensure that children’s lives are not ruined due to youthful indiscretion. This reform will let our youth know that such behavior is wrong without labeling them sex offenders for the rest of their lives,” said State Representative Joseph Abruzzo, according to CNN.
The consequences of being registered as a sex offender are far reaching. Philip Alpert, a registered sex offender as a result of sending a nude photograph of his 16-year-old girlfriend, was arrested by the Florida police for his crime.
The 18-year-old was kicked out of college, will be forced to retain the label of “registered sex offender” until age 43, and had his freedom traveling out of country is limited. Alpert says his legal status makes it difficult for him to find a job, and mentions the social consequences of bearing such a label.
Currently, in California, ‘sexting’ can result in possible charges of creating, distributing, and possessing child pornography. Though these laws are primarily designed to address adults’ abuse towards minors, minors are not except from possible charges.

Former American college student Amanda Knox was freed after an Italian court determined she was not guilty in an appeal Monday of murdering her former roommate.
Knox and her former boyfriend Raphael Sollecito, 27, were cleared of an earlier conviction for the murder of Meredith Kercher, a British student also studying in Perugia, Italy, in 2007.
“I did not do the things they say I did. I did not kill, rape or steal. I was not there,” Knox said in her final appeals statement to the court.
The case had garnered international attention from media outlets that were drawn to the prosecution’s story of what happened to Kercher, who was 21 at the time of her death. Lawyers for the state argued that she had been killed in a sex game gone wrong, while Knox and Sollecito maintained that they were not present at the time of the murder.
In a separate trial, jurors had convicted a drug dealer named Rudy Guede for the murder on DNA evidence found at the murder site. Prosecuters claimed Knox, Sollecito and Guede had attempted to involve Kercher in an orgy but that Kercher had resisted.
Kercher and Sollecito were both immediately freed. Knox broke down in tears after the verdict was read.
“We are thankful that Amanda’s nightmare is over,” Knox’s sister, Deanna, said in a statement afterward.
She thanked their lawyers as well.
“Not only did they defend her brilliantly, they also loved her,” she said.

The set-up: Arizona arrived at the Coliseum with a 1-3 record after playing three top-10 teams in consecutive weeks. The Wildcats hoped to turn their season around against a USC team that was coming off of a dismal performance at Arizona State.
The story: Following an unsuccessful opening drive for the Wildcats, the Trojans capitalized early in the first quarter with an 82-yard pass from Matt Barkley to Robert Woods. The Trojans also added a 46-yard field goal by freshmen kicker Andre Heidari. USC rounded out the first quarter with a 38-yard touchdown pass from Barkley to Marqise Lee to give the Trojans a 17-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.
The Wildcats answered back from USC’s early offensive production with a four-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Nick Foles to fullback Taimi Tutogi early in the second quarter. USC followed with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Xavier Grimble. After a 6 play drive, Arizona scored on a 27 yard touchdown pass to Ka’Deem Carey but USC blocked Wildcat kicker Alex Zendejas’s extra point. USC closed out the half with a 31 yard field goal by Andre Heidari. USC led Arizona 27-12.
USC opened the third quarter with a 28 yard touchdown from Matt Barkley to Robert Woods. Arizona’s Ka’Deem Carey rushed for a one yard touchdown closing the Trojan lead to 14 following a completed two point conversion. With less than five minutes left in the third quarter, Barkley threw his first inception of the game, which set the Wildcats up for another touchdown by Ka’Deem Carey. Carey rushed for 16 yards and Arizona trailed by 7 at the completion of the third quarter.
The Trojans completed a successful series with a one yard rushing touchdown by Barkley giving the Trojans a 41-27 lead. Nick Foles led the Wildcats on 85 yard drive ending with 12 yard touchdown pass to Juron Criner. USC tailback Curtis McNeal rushed for nine yards following a 79 yard series for the Trojans. Arizona attempted to stage a comeback against USC thus answering USC’s touchdown with a 6 play, 53 yard series resulting in 4 yard touchdown pass to Austin Hill. The Wildcats pulled within one touchdown in the final minutes, but USC recovered Arizona’s onside kick attempt and sealed the 48-41 victory.
Ice cream for the defense: Before the Arizona State game, Lane Kiffin promised the defense ice cream if they forced turnovers. Arizona quarterback Nick Foles entered the game with 10 touchdowns and 0 interceptions, but that quickly changed in the first quarter. Junior safety T.J. McDonald intercepted Foles twice in the first period. Following the first turnover, McDonald ran over to Lane Kiffin and tried to hand him the ball.
Another one for the record books: Junior quarterback Matt Barkley set a school passing record and led the Trojans to a 48-41 victory over the Arizona Wildcats Saturday.  Barkley threw for 468 yards and four touchdowns on 32 completions in 39 attempts. Former USC quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner, Carson Palmer, previously held the single game passing record with his performance against Oregon in 2002.
Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods nearly broke records himself. He notched 14 receptions for 255 yards. Woods was five yards shy of breaking the record for all-time receptions in a single game.
