Patrick Lynch, general manager of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, resigned Tuesday, hours before the Coliseum Commission was set to meet to determine the fate of his job.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Lynch came under increased pressure to step down as general manager after it was revealed that Todd DeStefano, his former events manager, was also a promoter for Insomniac Inc., which has hosted raves in the Coliseum.
Lynch is accused of allowing DeStefano to be in charge of the security and medical services at the Electric Daisy Carnival hosted at the Coliseum. while being a promoter for Insomniac Inc.
A teenage girl died of a suspected drug overdose at the EDC and multiple other drug problems were reported.
Lynch, who served as general manger of the Coliseum and Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena for 17 years, maintains that he was unaware of DeStefano’s employment with Insomniac Inc.
Lynch had been an important player in trying to bring a professional football team to Los Angeles, according to the Los Angeles Times.
DeStefano is currently under investigation by the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office for possible charges of criminal conflict of interest. The Fair Political Practices Commission is also looking into whether DeStefano committed a criminal act when he did not disclose income from an outside source and for conflict of interest.
Jorge Montoya, a graduate student studying aerospace engineering, said he believes that Lynch made the right decision in resigning, regardless of Lynch’s knowledge of DeStefano’s job as promoter.
“When you’re in charge of an office and there is corruption, it is the right thing to do to step aside even if you did not directly do anything wrong,” Montoya said.
BREAKING NEWS: People do drugs, drink, and smoke at concerts/raves/clubs/festivals and have been doing so for decades. If they cancel EDC at the coliseum, you can bet that another municipality would LOVE that tax revenue and job creation.
I think $4 million and thousands of job for the community in one night is well worth is supposed “risks” of raves. Let EDC stand!!! Rave on little children, rave on.
This better not affect the Commission’s decision to let EDC return this summer.  It’s only thousands of jobs and millions of dollars on the line.

The U.S. State Department recently released a statement cautioning students about traveling abroad during spring break, but many USC students said they are still planning to head to popular vacation spots such as Cabo, Cancun and Puerto Vallarta.
“I’m not worried about any type of threats and I’m really excited about going to Mexico,” said Victoria Willingham, a sophomore majoring in psychology and Spanish.
The State Department reported that each year U.S. citizens have been badly injured or killed in accidents, falls and other mishaps while traveling abroad. Many of these incidents have been related to alcohol and drug use.
Other spring break vacationers have been sexually assaulted or robbed because, according to the State Department, they found themselves in unfamiliar locales and were incapable of protecting themselves.
More than 2,500 U.S. citizens are arrested while abroad every year. Nearly half of the travelers arrested each year were for narcotics charges that include having very small amounts of illegal substances in their possession.
The State Department issued the advisory on spring breaks to raise students’ awareness. It noted, however, that the majority of students will have safe and enjoyable adventures.
Juan Espinoza, a junior majoring in communication and international relations, said he believes most students can stay out of trouble while in Mexico.
“Mexico is safe. Most of the violence is connected to drug cartels,” Espinoza said. “So if students aren’t engaged in those activities they will be fine.”
Elizabeth Chau, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she does not plan to travel outside of the country during spring break because she is concerned for her safety.
“The risk is too great,” Chau said. “You have no idea what could happen to you right now with everything going on.”
Carol Wise, a professor of international relations, said students should be more wary of traveling to Mexico’s border states.
“I feel safe in [Mexico]. I just wouldn’t go to the border states,” Wise said. “I feel as safe there as in South Central Los Angeles.”
To keep safe, the State Department urged all U.S. citizens traveling, studying or residing abroad to sign up online for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. STEP makes it possible for the State Department to contact the student traveler in the case of a family emergency in the United States or because of a crisis in a foreign country.
Devin Carey, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she believes the STEP program could be more helpful for students traveling in small numbers.
“If I were going to Mexico with a small group of people I would sign up [for STEP], but I’m going with a lot of people so I think I’ll be relatively safe without it,” Carey said.

The Undergraduate Student Government Elections Commission determined that presidential candidate Monish Tyagi  committed a minor violation of the elections code by having campaign materials present where alcohol was consumed or present. Tyagi and running mate Logan Lachman will be not be allowed to wear their campaign T-shirts for one hour today.
Rock the vote · Steven Ilami, a freshman majoring in computer science, and Anatashia Lewis, a senior majoring in public relations, cast their votes. - Cory Sanford | Daily Trojan 
“The Tyagi-Lachman campaign was found in violation of wearing campaign material in an unapproved location,” said Barb Solish, the USG Elections Commission chair. “However, the commission determined the intent of both the code and the candidates as well as circumstance warranted a minor sanction.”
Tyagi and Lachman will not be allowed to wear their campaign T-shirts today from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.
Vice presidential candidate Rohan Mehra, who is running with Alex Fadil, filed the formal complaint against Tyagi on Monday.
The complaint included two photos that show Tyagi wearing a campaign shirt at a nighttime event with a DJ in the background. The complaint suggested alcohol could have been present, given the setting of the photo.
“The intention of the rule is to not to use alcohol in a way to promote or entice people into your campaign in any way,” Tyagi said. “In the code it states that alcohol may not be used at any campaign events, and I think it’s very clear that this was not a campaign event.”
All three presidential tickets confirmed that they agreed before the election to discuss such allegations with each other before filing any complaints.
Mehra said no malice was intended in filing the complaint.
“Traditions is a bar that serves alcohol,” Mehra said. “Everyone would agree that it’s unfair to campaign in an alcoholic venue. We were just figuring out if campaigning was going on or if it was an accident.”
Current USG President Chris Cheng, whose campaign was sanctioned last year for using an e-mail listserve last year, said the charges are part of the learning experience of running a campaign.
“It taught us that keeping track of details really helped us out in running our administration to keep an eye out for the rules and to make sure that everything went according to protocol,” Cheng said. “It helped us know now to make things run smoothly this year.”

I’m a semi-recent alumni (and journalism major) and as such, have no vested opinion in the outcome of the election. However, I fail to see how this article is biased. I can’t even tell who people are accusing Ms. Bracker of being biased towards. All I see here is reporting on the results of an infractions case, using quotes from involved parties interspersed with facts from the ruling and complaint. I’ve read through the rest of the campaign coverage as well and see no injection of opinion or biased reporting. 
Yes, the DT endorsed a candidate, but nearly all print publications do so. Apparently this is a hotly contested election, but there is no reason to accuse a student who is most likely just trying to complete their journalism learning lab requirement of being part of some media conspiracy. Doesn’t that seem a little silly?
Rachel’s reporting and twitting had been so biased, so unprofessional and speculative….. putting a fair press to shame.
Sigh……
I think this is what happens when the Daily Trojan is allowed to officially back a candidate. Their reporting about this matter has been one-sided from day one and obviously biased. They even had to make a formal correction to a previous article where they smeared Monish and Logan with speculation and untrue details. I just think in the future that the DT should remain on the sidelines of the election and be an un-biased resource for the students.
How about instead of not letting Tyagi-Lachman wear their shirts for an hour, you hand them a pamphlet saying they can shit all over USG elections rules and do whatever they want, because they aren’t going to be held accountable for anything they do?
This whole things seems to be a simple dirty trick. Mehra failed to respect his own words to discuss such matter amongst all candidates, and then after reporting he kept repeating that its ‘not a big deal’ and ‘no malice intended’.
His acts were either simply naive or malicious. Unfortunately, Daily Trojan’s covering of the event is not an example of mature press. It was so speculative  Its so unfortunate, specially at the election event. Simply a bad press!!
You said it best.  Besides the blatantly awful reporting, where is an editor??  why is our publication looking so shabby?

Jeopardy! pitted the man versus the machine Monday night, as Watson, a computing system that uses Question Answering technology, was quicker than its human opponents in 24 out of 30 “Double Jeopardy” questions.
Mr. Roboto · Steve Canepa, IBM’s general manager, hosted a watch party Tuesday to view the launch of Watson on Jeopardy!. Students were impressed by the system’s language skills. - Robin Laird | Daily Trojan 
Members of the Viterbi School of Engineering’s Information Sciences Institute are among a group of scientists from eight universities who are working to advance Watson, which was designed by IBM to understand human language and language complexities and to provide answers to factual questions.
Watson, named after IBM founder Thomas J. Watson, sorts through its extensive database and tries to provide precise answers quickly. Watson is even able to understand different attributes of human language such as rhyming, alliteration, slang, riddles and puns.
Steve Canepa, IBM’s general manager, hosted a watch party at University Gateway on Tuesday for students to watch Watson’s Jeopardy! debut.
“It takes Watson an average of three seconds to answer a question,” said Jennifer Chu-Carroll, a research staff member and manager at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. “And it looks through a database of over 1 million books.”
Chu-Carroll has worked on many parts of the Watson system, focusing primarily on developing the system’s ability to quickly narrow down the information in its repertoire to what is relevant to the question being asked. Watson finds about 100 sentences that it thinks could contain the answer and ranks the possibilities in order of confidence.
“If Watson is 90 percent sure, it’ll buzz its answer in. If it’s 40 percent sure, it probably won’t,” Chu-Carroll said.
Students who attended the watch party were intrigued by Watson’s grasp of the English language.
“When you consider all the nuances of the human language, it’s impressive that Watson understands so much of it,” said Peter Perez, a graduate student studying engineering management.
Members of Viterbi’s ISI first became involved with IBM in 2001, but only as part of a government-funded research program.
Inspired by the QA technology that many universities were developing in their labs, IBM scientists designed Watson over the course of about seven years and then invited other scientists from universities such as USC, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Texas to collaborate on the project. USC has had QA technology for about 10 years, but it was separate from the Watson project.
The ISI team specifically contributed to Watson’s parsing ability, the process of analyzing a text, and its inference skills, the ability to reason and draw conclusions.
IBM hopes Watson will revolutionize many industries and even assist in research.
“There is so much information out there. It is beyond anyone’s ability to go through all of it,” Chu-Carroll said. “So one thing we have tried to do is bridge the gap between the human user and the vast amount of information available.”
Eduard Hovy, director of the ISI Human Language Technology group and research associate professor of computer science at USC, said Watson could not only be used to greatly improve the confidence of existing search engines, but could also be used for troubleshooting, business intelligence and medical assistance.
“Medical information is growing so quickly, no doctor can stay up-to-date,” Hovy said.
Advanced QA technology could be used to sort through medical information and give diagnoses based on patient symptoms. The doctor would then evaluate the information provided and make the ultimate judgment call.
Watson’s ability to answer questions as well as a human is currently being tested in the first human versus computer competition on Jeopardy! which will air for the last time today.
“We felt as though our system performs well enough, that it would put up a respectable fight whether it wins or loses,” Chu-Carroll said.
Watson is a big step forward in language technology. It’s a precursor for the way computers will be designed and how people will be able to communicate with them in the future, according to Chu-Carroll.
“As researchers, we’ve known that [technology like Watson] has been possible for a long time, but it’s great to see it finally being realized,” Hovy said.
Students are excited about the possibilities for future technology after watching Watson on Jeopardy!.
“I think it’s great to see this advancement in technology,” said Sinead Hinson, a junior majoring in public relations. “Who knows what will happen with the next generation.”
I need Watson to take my exams for me.

USC junior middle linebacker Devon Kennard will be limited for at least the start of spring practice, as he is recovering from an offseason hip surgery, according to the Orange County Register.
The junior linebacker had a surgery on a torn labrum in his left hip in December. He is unsure as to when he will be back on the field, but is hoping for early April.
“I want to make sure I’m ready for fall,” Kennard told the Register. “It’s a big season for me. I want to help the team win.”
The injury came midseason and Kennard never felt the same after. He tried to play through the injury but eventually lost his starting job to then-redshirt junior Chris Galippo.
Kennard has been doing physical therapy with the training staff and weight work to recuperate. He will begin running on it in the next couple of weeks.
Although many have clamored for the former defensive end to move back to a pass-rushing role on the perimeter, Kennard said he plans on staying on the second level at middle linebacker. He will be competing for his starting spot when he is back on the practice field.
Spring practices begin March 22.

The accolades are starting to mount for USC senior Maria Sanchez.
On the heels of her fourth career Pac-10 Player of the Week award, Sanchez now stands as the nation’s top women’s singles player. This is the first time a USC women’s tennis player has held the post since Amanda Fink in 2006.
Above the rest · Senior Maria Sanchez becomes USC’s first women’s tennis player to be ranked No. 1 in the nation since Amanda Fink in 2006. - Murugappan Aroonachalam | Daily Trojan 
Rising only as high as the second slot her junior season, this announcement marked Sanchez’s debut in the No. 1 spot.
After beating Aeriel Ellis, the nation’s No. 8-ranked player, Sunday, Sanchez has now strung together 15 consecutive singles match victories, including four wins over top-10 opponents. As the anchor for No. 17 USC, Sanchez has enjoyed consistent success despite regularly matching up against the opponent’s top player.
Sanchez’s last defeat came at the hands of fellow teammate, and budding star, Danielle Lao, in the ITA Southwest Regional Championship match last fall.
Sanchez’s new rankings shine some much-needed light on USC as a dark horse to compete among the nation’s elite tennis programs come the NCAA championships in May. After only reaching the quarterfinals last season, Sanchez should be looking to compete for an NCAA title this year, considering her torrid start to this season.
As a senior, Sanchez has begun to cement her legacy in Trojan athletics. With an upstart group behind her, contending for a national championship is still a realistic goal for the Women of Troy.

USC sophomore outfielder Alex Glenn knows all too well what it’s like to fly under the radar.
After all, during the first two years of his high school career at Henry County High School, Glenn patrolled the outfield with Jason Heyward, the No. 14 pick of the 2007 MLB draft and the current right fielder for the Atlanta Braves.
Needless to say, the two players have taken different paths since their high school days in McDonough, Ga.
For Heyward, the path was a rather smooth and painless one.
A first-round draft pick, the No. 1 ranked prospect in the Braves organization by Baseball America a year later and then within three years, starting on their opening day roster.
For Glenn, although the road to fulfilling his personal dreams was paved with good intentions, the trek is still just beginning.
“I look at Jason as a mentor, for what he has been able to do,” Glenn said. “Getting a chance to watch him on the field and off, to see how he carried himself, was very important for me.”
Glenn was also drafted, albeit in the 37th round of the 2009 draft by the Florida Marlins.
His draft status, however, was in no way indicative of the type of talent he put on display for four seasons at Henry County High School.
One look at No. 24 roaming the outfield, running down the baseline or taking a pitch with power the opposite way, it’s not difficult to see that he has all the tools.
So why did he plummet down the draft board in 2009?
After much deliberation with his family members upon graduation, Glenn decided that unless he was presented with an offer he couldn’t refuse, it was more practical to take the traditional route: testing his skills at the collegiate level while also getting an education.
So the big winner in the Alex Glenn sweepstakes was, of course, USC.
But after last year’s subpar freshman campaign in a limited role, you would have been hard-pressed to convince the outfielder or former USC coach Chad Kreuter that either had benefited from his measly 14 starts.
Although a .193 batting average with 11 hits, 12 RBIs and two stolen bases doesn’t even scratch the surface of Glenn’s potential, a summer of changes — in his own game and in the USC program — have the sophomore all smiles about the Trojans’ 2011 season, which begins Friday night against Missouri.
When Frank Cruz was hired on an interim basis to take over the coaching duties for Kreuter, Glenn admits a monkey was essentially lifted off his back.
“Last year I was just so worried about not getting cut and then working to get playing time, that at times I stopped being myself out there,” Glenn said. “This year coach Cruz has told me that he wants me to be more aggressive. And I like that, because the one thing I pride myself most on is my speed.”
And if there is one glaring issue that has plagued USC throughout its five-year run of futility, it is base running.
Last year, the Trojans not only finished last in the Pac-10 with 34 stolen bases, but their top base-stealer, junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa, only swiped seven bags.
As a result, Glenn, who has the speed needed to swipe bags on a consistent basis, is looking to help the Trojans improve their non-existent running game.
“It’s all about my work ethic and the mental side of the game,” Glenn said. “I need to just take things one game at a time in terms of handling the failure, and just having fun. I need to just enjoy the game.”
Although Glenn will add a level of flexibility to Cruz’s lineup card, a lot of the pressure will still fall on the broad shoulders of some of the team’s more seasoned players: Oropesa (.353, 20 HRs and 67 RBIs), junior outfielder Alex Sherrod (.315, six home runs and 28 RBIs) and senior infielder Joe De Pinto (.286, 72 hits and 23 RBIs).
All three should allow Glenn the opportunity to flourish in a supporting, under-the-radar-type role — an identity the 19-year-old plans to embrace with open arms.
“It’s going to be a lot like it was when I was playing in high school with guys that were going to be drafted or playing at big schools,” Glenn said. “ The other teams don’t know a lot about, so the pressure isn’t on me to be the guy, I just have to go out there and play hard on a nightly basis.”
And although the future isn’t as black and white for the USC outfielder as it was for his former high school teammate, something tells me flying under the radar might be just the thing that once again sparks a breakout year not only for Glenn, but for the Trojans as well.

Three months after improper contact between USC freshman tailback Dillon Baxter and another USC student resulted in Baxter’s suspension from a Nov. 20 game at Oregon State, USC’s Office of Athletic Compliance released a statement Tuesday outlining a new “Athletes and Agents” policy.
Crucial · Since Pat Haden took over as athletic director, the university’s compliance staff has increased in size and prominence. The newly released “Agents and Athletes” policy is intended to further help USC student-athletes remain in good standing with the NCAA. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan 
The statement, sent via e-mail Tuesday morning to students, staff and faculty noted that USC, in an effort to remain in compliance with NCAA rules, stresses that students and staff members refrain from impermissible conduct with student-athletes.
“We are committed to protecting our student-athletes from any contact, communication or conduct with individuals who seek to inappropriately contact or represent student-athletes before their eligibility is exhausted or voluntarily terminated,” wrote Elizabeth Garrett, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, and Todd Dickey, senior vice president for administration.
According to the university’s compliance office, the policy is the first of its kind.
“I’m unaware of other universities adopting such a policy,” said Dave Roberts, USC’s vice president for athletic compliance. “With all the press we’ve been getting, you’d think someone would have said they’d had seen a similar policy before.”
Under the policy, students, staff and other third parties are required to notify USC’s compliance office of their involvement with a sports agency before any interaction with student-athletes.
“We’re publishing this to the student body, so they can be aware,” Roberts said. “Of course, somebody could choose to ignore it, but we have to at least be proactive by putting the policy in place.”
Specifically, the new regulations stipulate that all such parties provide written notification to the school’s compliance office within 24 hours of their involvement with a sports agency or similar marketing agency.
Those found to be in violation of the policy would then be subject to remedial action and/or discipline, according to the release.
“I don’t think it’ll force a divide between students and student-athletes,” Roberts said. “It should only be an issue for certified agents.”
Last November, Baxter accepted a ride in a golf cart from a student, Teague Egan, who at the time was a National Football League Players Association-certified agent, in addition to founder and CEO of 1st Round Enterprises, a marketing agency that seeks to represent athletes and musicians.
“We have been exploring agent issues since June,” Roberts said. “1st Round accelerated the process and was the driving force behind the policy, but we had been looking at this before.”
Eventually, Baxter was declared eligible for USC’s final two games of the season after donating $5 to a local charity as repayment for the ride.
“The idea of a student-agent had not crossed anyone’s mind,” Roberts said.
Although USC met with the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee last month in Indianapolis, the recently announced policy is said to be entirely unrelated to the athletic department’s efforts to have NCAA-levied sanctions lessened.
“It’s completely, 100 percent separate,” Roberts said. “What the appeals committee sees is what we did in the past. The policy does not touch the appeal. It is forward-looking, and hopefully we can show the NCAA that we’re doing everything we can to police.”
The idea for the policy did come at least partially from USC’s athletic department, which is separate from compliance.
“We do work closely with athletics,” Roberts said. “They’re supportive of it. At request of their office, we were able to put this in place.”

Every so often, a new diet or fitness plan takes the world by storm and becomes a kind of buzzed-about fad, with people flocking to it en masse.
Eye on the prize · Tim Feriss’ new book The 4-Hour Body challenges readers to test their ability to resist foods such as sugary treats and dairy items to effectively lose weight. - Photo courtesy of Amy Hogg 
The last decade saw the Atkins Diet and the South Beach Diet. Workout programs like Insanity or P90X have become more recent hits as well.
Now the new buzz fitness guide is Tim Ferriss’ book, The 4-Hour Body.
Ferriss, whose first book, The 4-Hour Workweek, was an unconventional approach to escaping the everyday white-collar job, brings that same level of innovation to his new book.
It’s not quite a straightforward guide to physical health.
Instead, Ferriss’ book can best be described as a health version of the Choose Your Own Adventure series we read as kids.
If you want to lose weight, follow a certain set of chapters. Looking to bulk up and build muscle? There’s another set for that. Aiming at overall good fitness? Skip to the last few chapters and adopt the tips to help your running and swimming skills.
In a way, The 4-Hour Body is a catch-all book for every stage of physical health, from those trying to get in shape to those trying to increase their strength or skills.
The book is built around the idea of the minimum effective dose, the least amount of work that has to be done to achieve the best physical benefits.
With that in mind, the book focuses on the pragmatic.
At times, its content can be grating or difficult to keep up with.
The center piece of Ferriss’ weight loss plan is what he calls the Slow-Carb Diet.
The diet is centered around eliminating sugary, fat-building foods like fruit, juices, white bread, white rice and dairy, with the exception of a once a week “cheat day” splurge where anything goes.
Put into practice, the diet works quite well and can be very effective at burning body fat.
Its limited options, however, can drive the practitioner a bit crazy. It takes a good deal of restraint to keep caloric splurges limited to the “cheat days.”
When it comes to workout advice, Ferriss keeps it simple and minimal.
There are only four exercises for the abdomen and limbs combined, designed to be compound and to build a variety of muscles through simple movements.
One aspect that feels a bit unnerving is Ferriss’ heavy use of drugs to help with his fitness.
Though he doesn’t advocate for anabolic steroids, Ferriss still uses chemical cocktails of supplements and integrates them into daily life.
For anyone trying to avoid creatine or other supplements, many of Ferriss’ principles might need to be adapted.
Yet there are numerous benefits to be gained from the book. Little tips and factoids can help readers make more informed decisions about their health, in terms of diet (spinach is a nutrient super food) or even things like sex (guys, if you’re looking to have kids, don’t put your cell phone in your pants pocket) and running faster (use fewer, longer steps rather than many short ones).
Of course, when put into practice, the book’s goals becomes a bit more difficult to achieve.
For a college student, especially one splitting groceries with roommates who might not be on the diet, keeping enough groceries stocked to maintain the Slow-Carb Diet can be hard.
Many of Ferriss’ practices require strict adherence and patience.
The workouts can seem underproductive and readers may end up doing much more, despite what Ferriss prescribes.
The Slow-Carb Diet can drive people insane if they don’t know how to add some variety to the food they eat (spices, and lots of them, are a must).
What is most effective are Ferriss’ methods for tracking change.
He suggests doing body measurements and taking photos before starting any fitness program.
Weight can always fluctuate, but these methods give people working on their physical health a solid base to judge their improvement on.
The 4-Hour Body might cater to the interests of an eccentric fitness freak over those of a casual gym member.
After all, a good diet and regular exercise might be all a person needs to stay healthy and in shape.
But, if a radical regimen is desired, or if the minimal effective dose is what works best with a busy schedule, then The 4-Hour Body is the book to pick up.
Great article man,
but you forgot to talk about the section in the book on Sex, and the great visual guide on how to satisfy a woman. I practiced the technique in the book on, uh, my roommates love toy, and I think I will impress my next girlfriend. I almost want to lend my book to My RA in Fluor Tower, So he can teach all the bros in the building know how to break it off proper!  Cuz Fluor Tower Represents Son!
I’m sure the book will give people ideas on how to lose weight. However, P90X and Insanity have been working for people because its a workout program with a meal plan. This book sounds like it will be vague into how you make positive fitness and eating habits for the long term.

Seattle’s Best Coffee does not quite live up to its name.
Although the original 1991 product might have been Seattle’s best, the current brand, now a subsidiary of the one-and-only coffee juggernaut Starbucks, proves once again that adding boastful adjectives into the title of a brand often creates a little irony somewhere down the road.
Coffee break · Sarah Young (left) and Kristen Mooney, both first year graduate students majoring in social work, talk at Seattle’s Best Coffee. - Alex Dealy | Daily Trojan 
Simply put, the coffee at the University Gateway branch of Seattle’s Best Coffee isn’t the best coffee in Seattle, in Los Angeles or even at USC.
The coffee might not live up to its lofty title, but Seattle’s Best Coffee is still a great option for caffeine-deprived students looking for a calm place to read a textbook and sip on a decent cup of joe.
Inside, Ferrari-red espresso machines sit on the counter tops, like props lifted off an Italian movie set. Authentic or not, they look like they mean business. Behind the cash registers sit multiple large carafes of brewed coffee.
The coffee brews are numbered one through five, with the numbers indicating the coffee’s strength. This numeric system is a newly implemented Seattle’s Best Coffee touch, offering an assortment of roast strengths for customers. Flanking the coffee is a case full of the usual foodstuffs, the likes of sweet and savory pastries.
As for the actual coffee pouring out of these fancy machines? To say they run strong and dark in flavor would be an understatement.
If you enjoy bold, rich coffee blends, you too might make the mistake of ordering a cup of the number five brew.
The number five has the curious condition of both lacking a rich, full body while simultaneously tasting a little like the old coals from a frat-house barbeque.
The flavor of an immediate slurp is fine: toasty, if a bit watery.
But the coals kick in half a second later, leaving an effusive bitterness that simply doesn’t go away. The coffee also refuses to be acidic, like  poorly brewed coffee often does.
The blend is confusing, since it is smooth, but not at all flavorful.
Things get better down the line. The number three is decent, with an inviting aroma and hints of chocolate and oak.
Numbers one and two are much fruitier and nuanced, with less of the ashy aftertaste of numbers four and five.
But all the coffees of Seattle’s Best Coffee suffer from a lack of body, that hard-to-describe sense of heft that good coffees offer.
The espresso is similar as well, past the point of being “dark.” At times, it tastes uncomfortably charred.
Knowing the nature of the coffee blends at Seattle’s Best Coffee, it’s hard to say whether that coal flavor is a flaw of the coffee itself or a subtle mistake in espresso extraction.
Either way, the espresso drinks suffer greatly because of it.
Still, some of the flavored espressos are much better than the fare sloshed at Trojan Grounds or The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.
The Salted Toffee Ultimate Mocha is one drink where the roasted flavor of the espresso works, tempering the sweetness of the chocolate.
The last few sips are a bit too strong, likely from sunken flavorings, however, it’s a tasty drink, particularly if you like the combination of sweet and salty.
Thankfully, the lattes are reasonably good, because of the sweetly steamed milk carefully poured into cups, leaving a thick, generous head of foam.
Still, there are no moments of complete coffee nirvana to be found here. Whereas the simple latte can be a dream come true at, say, the on-campus Shop Café, the drinks of Seattle’s Best Coffee always seem to have flaws.
For the most part, the flaw is fundamental: coffee that simply flaunts its hammer-like strength without the body or nuance to give it well-rounded flavors.
Like the shop’s chic interior, the coffee here is only well done in limited ways.
Some details are adequately polished, such as the elegant roast-level system and the steamed milk, but overall, the drinks simply don’t ascend to the aromatic heights one might expect from a chain called Seattle’s Best Coffee.
thanks for the comprehensive and well-written critique — very helpful.  the salty toffee drink is over-the-top but I might give it a try!
Believe me, those of us who live in Seattle agree (and are somewhat embarrassed). Seattle’s Best has been far from it for as long as I’ve lived here, and long before Starbucks bought them.

The music world’s battle with digital streaming and illegal downloading rages on, but one of the newest computer programs shows the problem to be most prevalent in the United States.
Spotify is a computer program that allows completely legal and ad-supported streaming of a wide variety of music.
It’s somewhat akin to the original Napster, but legal.
Basically, it’s like clicking through music videos on YouTube, but with less hassle and better sound quality. Any music fan can surely see the benefits of free music.
Spotify allows you to share music with friends, build playlists and libraries and even buy music if you really like it.
There’s also the opportunity to pay for Spotify Premium, which offers additional features such as an offline mode or streaming to various devices such as iPhones, computers or TVs.
If you’re in the United States and you click the “Get Spotify” link, however, you’ll be greeted with a very disappointing announcement: “Spotify is not yet available in your country.”
For a country that prides itself on being the land of the free, the United States hasn’t done a great job living up to its mantra.
Rights are being denied to the many Internet users who understand that the Web should be an open place to share and discover new music.
There have been bills proposed to give the government control of the Internet and the ability to censor it, but it’s actually not U.S. officials stopping Spotify from being available.
It’s the music labels.
This is yet another sign the music industry has not learned from its mistakes.
For years, the music industry spent thousands of dollars on lawsuits against people who downloaded a few songs off Napster.
By doing so, the industry failed to embrace the idea of file sharing and using it to its own advantage.
And there are still lawsuits against file sharers going on today.
This is part of the reason Steve Jobs and Apple became so successful.
The CEO of the then-second-tier computer company recognized that the music business was changing and that people would prefer MP3 downloads and players if given the option.
The interesting thing is that the major U.S. record labels all offer their music in the European market.
None of them, however, have allowed Spotify to offer the same service in the United States.
They might be using Europe as a testing ground before bringing it to the larger and more attractive American market, but it’s unclear why they still haven’t opened the program since it’s been so successful overseas.
The Los Angeles Times has reported that EMI, one of the four major labels in the music industry, is close to cutting a deal with Spotify U.S., but is concerned that “only 7.5 percent of European users are paid subscribers while the rest opt for the free service.”
What the label fails to realize is that having even 7.5 percent of users pay for the service might give them the extra money they need to save the otherwise failing business.
If fans have access to digital versions of a label’s songs, they’re more likely to go out and buy a CD.
Jobs was thinking this way when he created iTunes.
Jobs was successful.
Labels need to realize they might be only delaying the inevitable by trying to stop Internet file sharing, as every young person with a computer and the ability to use Google can easily find almost any album ever created with a few keystrokes.
If music labels can’t adapt to new forms of music consumption that are going to exist whether they do or not, the labels are going to become antiquated like the hard copy CDs they’re still pushing.
The Internet is an open place. The music industry needs to be too.

Vocalist and songwriter Melissa Manchester has persevered through four decades of shifting music styles. She has survived grimy bars and mistreating management. And now, she has set her sights on college.
With one GRAMMY award, several television appearances and countless performances and songwriting experiences since her career began, Manchester is ready to share her musical wisdom with a new generation of music enthusiasts at USC’s Thornton School of Music.
Manchester, whose father was a bassoonist for the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and whose mother was a former singer during World War II, grew up with music in her blood.
“Music was just a basic part of my education,” Manchester said. “There was always singing in the house.”
From a very young age, Manchester knew exactly what she wanted to do.
By 17, she was being paid to write songs. At 18, she had already started performing at clubs and looking for record deals.
But Manchester was never prepared for the harsh realities of the music industry.
“When I started to perform in clubs, I assumed it was more like performing in my parents’ living room,” Manchester said. “But the reality of performing is really rigorous, and artistic life takes a certain kind of bravery that you only see in retrospect.”
Eventually, there came a point in her life when Manchester felt the need to walk away from her career.
“I became very frustrated with the changing musical industry landscape,” Manchester said. “It became so electronic, and the demonization of the soul was more and more evident. I felt like I was losing my way.”
It was only after a decade’s break that Manchester gradually eased herself back into the music industry. She found a small community of musicians in Nashville, Tenn., people who wrote songs with good old-fashioned pianos, guitars and a quiet room.
“There’s always something intimate about the experience of waiting for the muse to start dancing about the room,” Manchester said.
It was in that room that she composed many of the songs for her 2004 comeback album, When I Look Down That Road.
You won’t find flashy dance moves, popping rhythm or funky costumes in Manchester’s numbers. Like her 1970s hit songs “Midnight Blues” and “Don’t Cry Out Loud,” her music still projects soulful, delicate melodies and deep lyrics that require thoughtful attention. Somehow, Manchester has preserved her unapologetic, authentic voice and graceful songwriting skills.
Manchester never underwent formal musical training except for a rare opportunity to study under Paul Simon at New York University.
In fact, it was a complete surprise when Manchester received the unexpected call from Thornton’s associate dean for external relations, Chris Sampson, who asked if she could fill in a last-minute, open spot teaching songwriting for musical theater to a group of six undergraduate students.
“I started this class not knowing what I was going to do,” Manchester said, laughing. “Nobody told me what was being done before; they just kind of threw it at me.”
Manchester has had experience writing musicals, such as “Hats!” and “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.” Musical theatre, she said, is one of the few places where true magic can happen.
To gauge her students’ proficiency in songwriting, she first asked them to write a highly emotional song in which their characters belt out the consequences of their addictions.
“They were really fantastic,” she said. “I love their enthusiasm — they really want to learn, and they’re very talented.”
Manchester constantly reminds her students to think deeper and to discover musical motifs for their characters by meditating on how the song changes according to the character that sings it.
In doing so, she reminds her students of the beauty and mysterious power of music, the ability to touch, enlighten and change people.
“In its essence, the definition of musical theater is when you are filled with so many emotions that you can no longer speak, but start to sing,” Manchester said. “It is not just to entertain, but really to create a discussion that transcends time.”
Still, Manchester said she finds certain aspects of teaching challenging.
“I’ve been doing this for so long that I just know how certain things work,” Manchester said. “I only hope I can convey certain things clearly because some things are so natural I just sort of breathe into it.”
For someone who grew up living and breathing music, Manchester said she still learns something new every day.
“[Teaching] has been a blessing and such a sweet gift in my life,” she said. “Both the students and I are always learning.”

Online content is the future of sports journalism, but some journalists refuse to give in.
The difference between sports journalists A.J. Daulerio and Bob Costas, for example, represents the ever-changing role of the media in sports and in the way society views sports coverage.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
To Costas, Daulerio must seem like the embodiment of a sports media Satan — a man who has turned the industry upside down, choosing to focus on the personal lives of athletes and media personalities.
Costas, meanwhile, has spent his whole career espousing the ideals of traditional sportswriters: Forge alliances with athletes and concentrate on their accomplishments on the field.
Daulerio is the editor in chief of Deadspin.com, the site that brought you news of Brett Favre’s explicit pictures, Rex Ryan’s foot fetish videos and most recently, former USC star Mark Sanchez’s sexual encounters with a 17-year-old girl — and that’s just what it uncovered in the past four months.
Deadspin is at the forefront of a new phase of sports coverage. Daulerio and his staff use guerilla journalism methods to obtain some of the raunchiest stories and pictures in sports.
And although Deadspin might be more famous for its ability to break stories about athletes’ personal lives, it has managed to break more traditionally newsworthy stories as well.
In August 2010, Daulerio broke a story about how MLB owners were creating profits through illegitimate accounting. In December, he obtained documents revealing how the New Orleans Hornets were in dire financial straits.
Daulerio and Deadspin are successfully toeing the line between investigative reporting and invasive reporting.
Daulerio’s ability to break stories that are both newsworthy and cringeworthy has earned him well-deserved respect and fame.
He was the subject of a GQ  magazine profile, and both the Favre and Ryan stories were picked up by mainstream outlets like ESPN and Sports Illustrated, adding to Deadspin’s buzz and credibility.
Admittedly, there are many sports journalists who have chosen to fight the tide and stick with traditional news. But many of those reporters are struggling to stay relevant in today’s age, and Costas is the perfect example.
Costas has chosen to resist the inevitable change caused by the Internet age of journalism. He doesn’t have a Twitter account or any kind of Internet presence.
He has staunchly held to the traditional sphere of journalism, and the field is leaving him behind.
Media has adapted significantly to the advent of the Internet and the digital age, and the shift to online content has attracted more fans to sites like Deadspin. Fans now feel they are a part of the conversation — and rightfully so.
Deadspin’s motto is “Sports news without access, favor or discretion.”
Although it might not be sports news in the traditional sense, the lack of favor or discretion is something fans have been craving. Daulerio has provided that.
At one point in his career,  Costas was a good journalist. He had astute commentary on timely issues and was one of the most highly regarded commentators of that time.
But as technology has developed, he has remained the same — stuck in the traditional role of media as we used to know it.
Costas is only hurting himself by looking down upon these widely used mediums. He is the face of traditional journalism. Daulerio is the face of the emerging form of journalism — web-based content.
Like it or not, Costas will be among the traditional journalists left in the dust while Daulerio and other bloggers continue their climb into the mainstream.

Chick-fil-A has been the focus of political ire recently, after the popular chain sponsored a Christian, anti-gay marriage group at an event in Pennsylvania earlier this month. Yet bringing political activism into private arenas does not accomplish anything, and it threatens to harm the foundations of our nation.
Their chicken sandwiches have made Chick-fil-A a standout among college students. | Creative Commons
Despite Chick-fil-A’s popularity among USC students, many people are not aware of the company’s Christian roots.
Founded by the Cathy family in the notoriously Christian deep South, the restaurant chain closes Sundays in observance of the Sabbath and encourages employees to attend church.
One aspect of the corporation’s mission is “to glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to [them].”
As our society becomes increasingly secular, many more people are sensitive to any expression of religion, particularly Christian, in the community.
Although Chick-fil-A is a private corporation and has the constitutional right to promote its religious beliefs, it seems people are offended by when they do so.
A Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender blog, Good As You, first discovered Chick-fil-A’s involvement with a pro-family values group called the Pennsylvania Family Institute when it saw the company’s name on a flyer for the group’s “Art of Marriage” event.
Soon after, gay rights activists began circulating and signing petitions calling for an end to the restaurant’s support of  anti-gay events.
Chick-fil-A representatives responded by saying the company has no political agenda and  was merely supporting the local community by donating food to surrounding churches.
People, notably student groups, didn’t buy it.
The issue has been especially volatile on college campuses. The restaurant was temporarily cut from Indiana University’s list of retailers as a result of a student movement, and Florida Gulf Coast University had similar plans.
Luckily, USC has not followed suit.
The deeply Christian roots of the restaurant chain’s founding family should be a sufficient explanation for its support of local church events and Christianity-based organizations.
To take a situation like this and turn it into a demonization of an all-American chicken restaurant as some corporation run by ignorant, intolerant homophobes is ridiculous.
Following this warped logic, one could even accuse In-N-Out of being anti-gay because it prints Bible verses on the bottom of its cups.
The funniest thing about this approach to political activism is that people are attempting to use a restaurant that makes chicken to get what they want.
No amount of boycotting will make gay marriage legal across the United States, especially if the place that people are boycotting doesn’t even have explicit anti-gay sentiments.
Not only is boycotting restaurants a futile tool for effecting political change, but it is harmful to the fabric of our nation and its communities.
Family-run companies embody what it is to be American, drawing on relationships and a propensity for hard work to contribute to the community. But in biting the hand that feeds, we only hurt ourselves.
Attacking those who contribute to the economic well-being and cohesiveness of our communities is not an impetus for sociopolitical change; it does quite the opposite.
Looking for any little thing to grab onto to incite political debate in areas where it will not actually effect policymakers is counterintuitive.
Being in the center of a major economic center, perhaps USC students will act with more business savvy in the midst of recent protests.
Let us analyze the situation before turning our back on a highly reputable restaurant chain near our own campus.
Sarah Cueva is a freshman majoring in political science.
I dont understand what the crying is about.  Not supporting gay marriage on the grounds of religion doesnt mean you are anti gay, it means you are following your religion.  Has anyone here even read the bible?  How about the quotes above? If someone is a Christian, Muslim or Jew, and homosexuality is considered immoral in their laws, then why do you think they should allow you to participate in their religious institution?  Let me reiterate: marriage is a religious institution, not secular.  What rights are you being denied?  You believe in separation of church and state, yet you are trying to get the state to intervene on the church.  Fight for a civil union to hold the same weight and rights as a marriage and be happy.  Accept that all choices in life have consequences.  Be gay, thats fine, but stop bullying everyone around you to change their way of life for you.  Not even the Greeks and Romans married their gay lovers, and homosexuality was a way of life for them.  They didnt see a problem, so why do you?
As Chick Fil A has a right to have their religious views…bla bla bla…so do those have a right to Freedom of assembly.  I grew up in the South….Chick Fil A used to come to my high school on career day every year to recruit…and yes I went to a private Christian school.  I can call them anti-gay, as I believe they are. As are most Christian organizations.  They still hold true the Old Testament line that homosexuality is an abomination.  No one’s being food, regardless of what the Cathy family says. We’re not stupid.
I boycott Chick Fil A.  Meaning, I won’t eat there or purchase anything from there. I don’t force my family to do the same. My husband and kids love their chicken.  I don’t stop them, but will never pick anything up from there for them either, they know this.  My choice to do so.  I’m not crazy about gay hater Jesus chicken.
There are too many simplistic yokels commenting  on here with their fallacious arguments a la slippery slope, straw man, poisoning the well, etc. And ewwhhh, poor grasp of the English language! 
DT needs to set up a “sign in” system that requires everyone to submit “traceable” profiles so that people stop trolling on here…because I know not everyone who kicks up dust on here is from SC. My local newspaper did that, and the profanity, vitriol, and racist comments abruptly dropped. 
..Anways, I’m gonna enjoy my Chick-Fil-A sandwich with criss cross fries, and some sweet Southern ice tea!!!! You have no idea how happy I am because there is a Chick-Fil-A close by. Next: Tommy’s Famous Chili Burgers, In-N-Out,
It’s come to my attention that there are some basic facts that are being misinterpreted here.  It seems people have come to the conclusion that Chick-Fil-A is donating to overtly anti-gay organizations of which there is no evidence at least from this article.  The defense is that the USC Chick-Fil-A is donating to community religious organizations.  The fact that some of these have anti-gay sentiment or are against gay marriage doesn’t seem to truly reflect on the company as a whole.  And even if the intent of Chick-Fil-A is to openly voice it’s disapproval of gay marriage, what is protesting really going to do?  Boycotting makes sense.  Don’t support them.  But believing that protesting an isolated incident at a fast food restaurant is going to enact social change is just naive.  I’ve read people equating this to boycotts and sit ins during the civil rights movements which is as much if not more of a stretch of the imagination than what you are accusing the writer of during her In’n’Out analogies.  Those protests were against widespread direct discrimination of blacks with the aim of making the discrimination illegal.  Protesting Chick-Fil-A for a single action is not going to force the federal government to outlaw the practice of donating to organizations based on their religious or political affiliations.  Protests are a great tool, but should be used for something that matters.  I equate it to going fishing with dynamite.  And for pete’s sake people.  IT’S A FAST FOOD CHICKEN RESTAURANT!  The gravity with which this has been discussed is laughable.  For the record I’m a democratic atheist from the California bay area who is  pro gay rights.  I’m just tired of seeing overzealous, belligerent and useless demonstrations.  (You can thank code pink for that one.)
LET THE FOOD BE SERVED MANNNNNNNNN THTZ ALL THT MATTERS!!! : )
You know you’re born with that body.You are raised up in a society where you’re allowed to make many choices to define who you are today. You have every rights and every power you have to ask for more to satisfy your needs and wants. When will it be enough? Homosexual is a choice. A contagious choice and it needs to be prevent. Not allow same sex marriage is one way to prevent it from spreading. If there is a cure for such a choice, we should look into scientific research. Marriage is not a right but it is a choice. For thousand of years wedding ceremony has always been between a man and a woman. To allow same sex marriage is like allowing immediate relatives marrying one another? To allow same sex marriage is like issuing citizenship to all illegal aliens? To allow same sex marriage is like issuing professional license to prostitutes? To allow same sex marriage is like legalizing all the drugs?
…Homosexuality is as much of a choice as is your grasp of the English language.  Sometimes you just can’t help it.  Not sure why you’re posing questions of your personal statements,  And marrying relatives is illegal since it often condones sexual intercourse which leads to genetic defects.  Same sex partners don’t exactly have that issue.  No study has shown child development is hindered by having same sex parents, Marriage between a man and a woman is a christian construct (marriage as an institution has been enacted by peoples around the world and is not exclusively a Christian construct), Homosexuality is not a disease, same sex marriage will not result in a bunch of new gay people… that’s not how reproduction works.  Based off your post, I have a feeling we should be way more pissed off at the failings of our education system.  You are the poster child for why we should not be cutting funds to public education.  We just can’t afford it.  Of course this post is useless, since it’s evident you won’t be able to read it.  So i’ll put it into simple terms for your simple mind:
“Gayz is good and you r dumb”
Nobody is infringing on anybody’s rights here.
Chick Fil A can have and can express their beliefs.
And people can, and have the right to, disagree with those beliefs in the form of a boycott.
To make an implication that not eating somebody’s chicken sandwich somehow equals “infringing on their religious rights” is beyond ridiculous, and I was told those very same words this evening by Bryan Fischer on American Family Radio.
I don’t eat there, as I think to be anti-gay is immoral.
If I wanted to eat there as a show of support of anti-gay policies, I would have that right too.
If this food chain wants to donate their chickens to Ku Klux Klan type events or whatever other less than noble causes, they have only themselves to blame for their public relations disaster.
I think the point the author is trying to make is that boycotting a USC Chick-Fil-A restaurant for something a Pennsylvania restaurant did is counterproductive. Chick-Fil-A is a franchise and each restaurant is independently owned and operated. It’s pointless to boycott the USC Chick-Fil-A, as the current owner of that restaurant has never spoken out against gay marriage. While Chick-Fil-A’s corporate office is very vocal about its religious beliefs, I don’t think it has extended to the point of protesting against gay marriage, with the exception of this independently operated restaurant in Pennsylvania. The CEO released a statement regarding the matter, and I encourage you to all read it. This was the action of an independently owned restaurant, not the company itself.
I don’t believe the author claimed that people don’t have the right to boycott, but rather was trying to say it’s ineffective in doing so in this situation. I will continue to eat at the USC Chick-Fil-A regardless of the decision of the Pennsylvania’s restaurant. I am in favor of gay marriage, but I’m not going to stop eating at the USC Chick-Fil-A because of some other restaurant 3000 miles away.
And Keely, you probably shouldn’t act like you have a monopoly on gay friends.
As a dedicated Christian, I concede that Chick-fil-A has every right to observe and express its Christian tradition.  However, there is a fine line between a Christian cause and an anti-gay cause.  Those who use their religion to defend out-dated and offensive political views are no different than those who used the Bible to justify slavery or the oppression of women.
While there has been a slight secularization of modern society, this is mostly the product of an increasing respect for the incredible breadth of American religious diversity and not a deliberate, underground anti-Christian campaign as so many seem to falsely believe.  No one expects the owners of Chick-fil-A to disown their religion, nor should anyone expect such a thing.
Lastly, political activism cannot conceivably challenge our nation’s foundations.  The ability to stand up in the face of injustice is one of the greatest products of our democracy and our Constitutional rights.  No one knew this better than another devout Christian: Martin Luther King, Jr.
Other than that, anyone whose personally attacking Sarah for her article should remove themselves from the forum.  This isn’t a country where we shout down opposition.
Grow up Keely!!   The purpose of an opinion article is to get people thinking about subjects that impact all of us and where differing thoughts and ideas exist and should be considered and discussed.  This article did that.
Your comment…”if their money is being actively used to deny my friends their rights”   Reread the article or do a little research before making stupid comments like this.  At no point in the article did the author support denying rights to gays.  In fact, the article states that Chik Fil A has made it very clear that they did not support denying gay rights but rather simply donated food to numerious churchs in the surrounding area.  Boycotts are fine however I think the point of the article is that, in this case, the Boycott is aimed in the wrong direction.  When people act ignorantly and attempt to push their agenda by condeming the wrong group of people the entire agenda looses credibilty and takes a step backwards.  Go grab a chickin sandwhich and some sweet tea and relax a little Keely.
Before making personal attacks, Jack: maybe you should do some research too.
Although Chick Fil A only served food at the the Pennsylvania Family Institute’s “Art of Marriage” event mentioned in the article, they have financially supported anti-gay organizations such as the The National Organization for Marriage’s Ruth Institute in the past.
And Keely clearly “[considered and discussed] subjects that impact all of us…” She’s not saying the article shouldn’t have been published, only that the author should be held accountable.
No personal attacks intended Quyennl.  I just think that if you are going to attack an article/author that you should attack/discuss the content and intent of the material vs. making up things out of context and thin air.  I agree, I should do more homework as I wasn’t aware of Chik Fil A supporting anti-gay organizations.  When I look at the web site for the Ruth’s institute they claim their mission is “Our mission is to create an intellectual and social climate favorable to marriage!”  Without digging deeper I can’t tell from this that they are anti gay but since they are pro “traditional marriage” you may be right.  Not sure the author should be attacked and insulted for believing a boycott of a christian based company is warranted because they support christian causes. It is, of course, our right to boycott anything we want, but to the authors point, I don’t think it accomplishes anything when pointed in the wrong direction. I pulled up other support that chik fil A has donated to in the past which covers everything from nursery schools to high schools to colleges.  It looks to me like this is a company that trys to support most of society while not attempting to alienate anyone.  I believe in gay marriage/rights but I don’t see why a boycott against a company like this furthers anyones cause.  It can only set it back………in my opinion
So much heat in here! Big chicken deal! I like Chick-Fil-A and In-N-Out, but I’m not Christian. I don’t care if they proselytize their religion on drink cups, or support causes against homosexuality. 
Both their food is great! I’ll eat more cows and chicken.
…So in your face: vegans/vegetarians!!! Are you gonna use the food card on me because I didn’t distinguish between “vegan” and “vegetarian?”
Many people have covered some issues already but I’d like to add:
“biting the hand that feeds, we only hurt ourselves,” With that attitude, most of the social progress in history would never have happened. Are we going to tell the Black slaves not to protest their plantation masters (who literally fed them)? I understand this analogy is limited because chick-fil-a is not directly oppressing gay people, but remember that not all social change comes from explicit laws and policies of the government. Things that raise awareness are not futile just because they don’t directly change laws, as others have already mentioned; the protests were not a direct attempt to make gay marriage legal (and admittedly, not eating at Chick fil a will not make gay marriage legal), although that can be the indirect effect. It’s a way for people to raise awareness about where their money is going and to defend themselves against a force they feel is impinging on their rights.
I sincerely hope that when you get into your field of work in the future that you remember that the United States is a country of people, not big business, and that, like wealth, human rights will not just simply trickle down from top to bottom. People are allowed to take action.
I’ve read the article. And no, I don’t believe the author thinks that those protesting should not have a right to protest. I don’t agree with the entirety of the article, and a couple phrases do stick out to me as being overly sensational, but also agree with aspects of it in that I believe in this case, demonizing Chick-Fil-A because they support a Christian organization isn’t fair to the corporation and ultimately makes homosexuals construed as looking for blood (chicken blood?) rather than working for constructive change.
But yeah, aspects of the article’s argument are a bit ridiculous for insinuating that boycotts never got anything done.
Leviticus 18:22 – “Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.” (NIV)
Leviticus 20:13 – “If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.”
1 Corinthians 6:9-10 – “Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.” (NIV).
I do not consider myself a Christian, but I do believe that the Bible is relatively clear that it deems Homosexuality a sin.  Of course, it simultaneously states that sinners can “inherit the kingdom of God” due to God’s forgiveness of sin, but it does clearly condemn homosexuality.  
So, I’d argue that a “Christian” organization supporting homosexual marriage (not homosexual rights, as I believe – and doubt Christians would disagree – that homosexual people should have every societal right as anyone else) directly contradicts Christian teaching.  
In my opinion: The idea that marriage – initially a religious institution – should carry with it societal rights and priviliges is a violation of the principle of separation of church and state.  However, I do not believe that the best way to solve this dilemma is to extend marriage to homosexuals (in direct conflict with the traditionally religious nature of marriage) but in fact alter the legal grounds marriage entails, and remove any special priviliges given to married couples vs. a partnership agreement (or whatever the most correct legal term is).  Homosexuals fundamentally deserve the same rights as everyone else, however I do not believe that the terminology of “marriage” is a right, due to the fact that homosexuality is clearly condemned by the religious institution under which marriage is traditionally performed.
There are a lot of people here advocating that Sarah be cut some slack because she is only a freshman. As another freshman, I call BS. That sort of excuse just sees that such people as Sarah are cut slack for bull like this when they, not their age, should be held accountable.
Sarah, you know very little about the principles on which this country was founded and the tools with which most civil rights advances have been made. Boycotting has in the past been one of the most crucial political tools of the United States–hardly a “threat to the fabric of our nation”–and we are fully within our rights to do so. Shutting up and sitting down doesn’t get anything done, and–though Chick-Fil-A might be “just a fast food restaurant”–if their money is being actively used to deny my friends their rights (for the problem here is not that they are Christian–so is In N Out, and I can’t find the slightest speck of news anywhere that they donate money to anti-gay right causes), I am fully free to refrain from giving them more money with which to do so.
Corporations and those of Sarah Palin’s ilk seem to think that, if we publicly censure or disagree with them, we are denying them of their right to free speech. But “free speech” doesn’t mean “freedom from criticism”–their detractors have free speech too.
Angela, the contraction for you are is you’re…”in college now.”  Fight On.
How did this editorial make it through the editor??  Was there someone off-duty, or has USC given up on intellectual rigor?  (or basic U.S. history and government…) Time to spend a little more time studying, Sarah.
“Not only is boycotting restaurants a futile tool for effecting political change, but it is harmful to the fabric of our nation and its communities.”
Yikes.  This article is really scary.  It scares me that an article like this could be published out of a reputable school like USC.  It scares me that you are missing the most fundamental aspect of democracy – the right to express our own ideas, our own preferences, our own CHOICES.  Boycotting a restaurant is an EXTREMELY powerful tool for effecting social change –  we have a powerful tool at our disposal as conscious consumers.  How do you reconcile the effectiveness of boycotts during the civil rights movement of the 60s?  Boycotting is not “harmful to the fabric of our nations.”  It is beneficial to the fabric of our nations.  By questioning , we not only exercise our rights, but uphold the tradition of participatory democracy.  Such a tradition helped us to recognize our bigotry and injustice in the 1960s, and it will help us come to terms with the systematic discrimination against gays today.  We will all look back on this time, down the road when ALL citizens have full rights, and reflect on our role in righting that injustice.  Personally, I hope I don’t look back with regret.  Sarah, I realize you are only a freshmen and you still have a lot of learning and growing to do at college, but I urge you to take a deeper look into your convictions.
Ha..ha.. Eric…. very simple…. Dont go and eat there… Are the forcing you? Its free society and you have a choice to
make, instead of protest.
Oh, yes but their chicken sandwich is so tasty….. perhaps you can resist going there…. hahahaha
Chick-fil-A’s Christian background is not the issue, so comparing these protests to hypothetical protests of In-N-Out because they print bible verses on their cups and paper is not only completely baseless and unjustified, it’s a complete exaggeration. You are naively assuming that anything Christian/biblical=anti-gay, which is ABSOLUTELY NOT the case. There are several Christian denominations that are completely supportive of queer rights, including the right to marry not only through the state but through the Church itself. The real issue is that this particular corporation decided to support an ANTI-GAY group that uses “Christian” rhetoric to support its views. Yes, everyone is entitled to their own opinion but PLEASE do not generalize and assume all Christians are anti-gay because that’s just plain inaccurate. And PLEASE, as an earlier post said, try to think a bit critically–your in college now.
I was going to write a much more robust response, but then I got to the bottom of the article and saw that Sarah Cueva is just a freshman.  Assuming she’s a teenager, I’ll cut her some slack for being quite a bit off the mark.  Besides, most of the comments here have already said what I was going to say.  Sarah:  Please continue to write and think critically and learn from your time at USC.  I’m sure you’ll learn/realize that (1) the public’s right to choose to support–or not support–private businesses IS part of “the foundation of our nation,” and (2) hyperbole such as “bringing political activism into private arenas…threatens to harm the foundations of our nation” only compromises your own credibility as a writer.  Good luck to you!  :)
Chik-fil-A owners have a right to donate to anti-gay causes. Its protesters have a right to boycott. It’s called the marketplace of ideas, and may the best man win.
For the record, I’m bisexual and I’m eating at Chik-fil-A regardless, sorry. *shrug*
what Eric meant by a corporation that actively tries to destroy his life is analogous to the idea of homosexuality and homosexuals in general being boycotted by what people think “God” meant and through personal interpretations of a text that has been translated and retranslated over and over and over again to fit political agenda and oppression of people through the ages. I think its ridiculous that any group or human can use a fairy tale to oppress others. one would think our cortex in our brains evolved to be smarter than this. we are truly and officially living in an idiocracy. one would think using god to oppress others would be passe in 20-effing-11.
A business takes certain risks when it nails the personal beliefs of the owners to their doors for all to see.  Or as Martin Luther might put it today, “In your face….”  But is this a Chick-Fil-A strategy (there is no bad publicity) to gather the flock for the inevitable negative reactions by evil homosexual and other outsiders?  In any case, Sarah, you go around flying your flag and you invite rejection, protest (that’s right, LAPD, protest), and flag-flying by others.  I hope the more thoughtful among the masses of chickens will use this opportunity to rise up, biting Chick-Fil-A from the rear as former customers head for the Nine-O for a round and some fries.
I think you miss the point of “rights.” While they have a right to use their private funds and influence however they see fit, we have just as much right to be unhappy about it. If their names are appearing on fliers for these events, and they are donating to them, then guess what? They’re engaged in the political arena.   
Certainly, they shouldn’t be threatened or demonized, but every American can protest ’till the cows come home if they see fit. 
It looks like the commenters above said things to a similar effect, so I’ll get off my soap box in short order, but I can’t think of a case where a protest, based in fact/events absent of baseless character defamation, is inappropriate.  Americans are notoriously complacent and we don’t protest about ANYTHING in force, and even though I don’t think that Chick-Fil-A’s actions merit a boycott myself, I am 100% behind the activist groups that boycott it.  If Chick-Fil-A really wants to make sure it doesn’t step on any gay toes, it would donate an equal amount to an LGBT org or something. Since it hasn’t, carry on, boycotteers.
You are missing the point of the boycott. It’s not that this will accomplish something in the political arena. It’s that I don’t like the profit that Chick-fil-a makes from me shopping there providing free food to people who actively try to destroy my life.
Really? People working for the word “marriage” to mean what it has always meant – how exactly does that “destroy” your life? If your life is “destroyed” by people disagreeing with you, you are kind of a pathetic little weenie, right?
And if gay people getting married “destroys” your or anyones life, then you/they have some serious issues.
Wow. If you were told you couldn’t marry the consenting adult person you love, and you were discriminated against in other ways as well, I probably wouldn’t call you a “pathetic little weenie” for it. But I guess I’m the pathetic one.
Really, Diane??  Sure, maybe Eric’s phrase “destroy my life” was an (obvious) exaggeration, but there really is no debate that anti-marriage crusaders are actively trying to keep rights from others.  
Keep pretending that they (you?) are just “working for the word ‘marriage'”.  
I’ll keep working on that definition of “small-minded, bigoted busybodies.”
If “people disagreeing with you” translates to said people actively trying to deprive you of rights granted every other citizen due only to your sexual orientation then, yes, it’s more than fair to use that kind of hyperbole–especially since the people running organizations like those also tend to work against other kinds of discrimination against GLBTs as well. Your calling someone “a pathetic little weenie” because they’re upset about being denied basic rights for an entirely arbitrary reason indicates that you are fairly despicable, deeply homophobic, and extremely ignorant. Go home.
Er, “work FOR other kinds of discrimination,” rather. I’m only running on a couple hours of sleep, people, sorry.
Jeez, the marriage police still rule in the 21st century?
Onward to full marriage equality now…

Some of your facts are wrong or misleading.
1.  USC doesn’t have a Chick-fil-a on campus.  It’s in Tuscany, which isn’t really USC.  This is important, because
2.  Indiana University South Bend (IUSB)’s Chick-fil-a (which only operates on Wednesdays) IS on campus.
Thus, USC couldn’t have “followed suit”.
Furthermore, Chick-fil-a operates FULL restaurants at IUPUI (Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis) and the REAL Indiana University (Indiana University Bloomington), but they didn’t kick Chik-fil-a off their campuses, so it’s also false to say “Indiana University” kicked Chick-fil-a out.  That’s be like UCLA losing to our football team, then saying we beat Cal.  (Which may be true, but not because we beat UCLA.)
Where is “Tuscany”? Not on USC Property? as a NYCer, I am going to sneak into the NYU Dining Hall to try Chick-fil-A (at their Aramark Corp Concession) This is per Article in the NYTimes of 03_FEB_11. Whoever said ” There is no such thing as Bad Publicity”, is Right.
The US Supreme Ct “Citizens United” Decision established Corporate Freedom of Speech. Right or Wrong, it is currently the Law of the Law. Boycott of the Corporation seems to be the only recourse. Lighten-up! It is not the End of the World. It is just Chicken.
Well, good for you, Dick.
Sarah, you’re totally wrong. “Yet bringing political activism into private arenas does not accomplish anything, and it threatens to harm the foundations of our nation.” WOW. This is a gigantic leap in logic, and you didn’t unpack it, whatsoever! Chick-fil-A can donate whatever it wants, and to whomever it wants. The people Chick-fil-A seeks to discriminate against are free to protest, and level boycotts against the company for their discriminatory behavior. Anti-gay, Christian zealots deserve all of the negativity they have coming to them. If you think for a second the gays are going to ask a bunch of bigots, nicely, for their permission via votes for marriage equality, you’re really living in a dream world. 
Until the gays are treated equally under the law, and Christian zealots are the only volunteers to prevent it from happening, boycott the bigots, and bankrupt them if possible. I hate them!
Good for Chik-Fil-A for taking a stand!  Part of what makes America a free country is the right of all people to make their own choices!  As a private company Chik-Fil-A has a right to support whatever causes it deems appropriate, while the public has the option to do business with the company or not.  End of story.  The reaction to this cause can definitely be seen as anti-Christian by the same logic as people are using to claim the company is anti-gay, and persecuting people for their religious beliefs is no different than what the gay community is accusing Chik Fil A of doing to them.  
Whether or not this was the right choice is irrelevant… the point is that America is a free country and ALL citizens have the right to do as they see fit, including privately held corporations.
Jay, your analogy is apples and oranges.
We in the LGBT community are not attacking Chick Fil A for being Christian; we are calling them out for being ANTI-GAY!  We are only attacking Christianity to the extent that being Christian and being anti-gay are one and the same, a premise which I reject, as do a lot of my gay Christian friends.
We are not on the offensive here. We are defending ourselves against the ATTACKS of organizations that Chick-Fil-A supports. To equate that defense with the affirmative initiation of anti-gay ballot questions and laws all across this country is intellectually dishonest at best, and willfully deceptive at worst.
The moment Chick-Fil-A stops expressing its Christianity by supporting attacks on me is the moment I will stop boycotting Chick-Fil-A, period. It has nothing to do with its Christianity, and everything to do with the direct effect its actions has on my life.
Jay, you are wrong. “…and persecuting people for their religious beliefs is no different than what the gay community is accusing Chik Fil A of doing to them.” The gay community has not facilitated a referendum on anyone’s right to get married, the Christian Klan has. The Christian Klan is responsible for every pre-emptive, and gay marriage referendum in the country. Chik-Fil-A supports professional, anti-gay, Christian organizations. It is one. It supports the anti-gay, Christian, claim that to strengthen opposite-sex marriage, they must ban gay marriage. Who is persecuting who here? What group has had a more tangible impact? 
Wake up.
Chick fil a has a constitutional right to it’s opinions and people have a constitutional right to p spend their money the way they want. The blogs have a constitutional right to inform people where organizations like chick fil a spend their money, which comes from their patrons. I’m sick of people equating one organization’s first amendment rights with some imaginary right to be free from criticism or retaliation from private citizens in the form of counter speech, AKA taking their money elsewhere.
The bottom line is that if any portion of revenue that comes into chick fil a will be donated to a cause that does not just hold an opinion, but affirmatively advocates for anti-gay laws, then OF COURSE gay people and our supporters have an interest in knowing that and of course we would have an interest in seeing that our money does not go through organizations like chick fil a to other organizations that will use it to hurt us! This is not difficult to understand. It is not about punishing chick fil; it is about defending our rights, which are CONSTANTLY under attack. And if you deny that, you are an idiot or simply not paying attention.

After nearly 30 years in power and 18 days of protests that captured the world’s attention, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt resigned from his position on Friday, ending an administration that was quickly losing support from many Egyptians in the months leading up to the protests.
While Egyptians rejoiced at the departure of Mubarak, the revolution has nevertheless raised several serious questions.
Throughout the protests, there was no clear opposition leader who seemed to be taking charge of the demonstrations. It was evident that the people of Egypt wanted Mubarak out, but less obvious was who would lead the country after his departure.
Mubarak passed power to the supreme council of the armed forces when he stepped down, essentially leaving Egypt under military rule. The military council announced that it would not act as a substitute for a “legitimate” government and today vowed to have a revised constitution drafted in 10 days and to transfer power to an elected civilian government in six months.
However, such a rapid transfer of power could potentially have negative side effects for an unstable Egypt. In the wake of the celebrations of Mubarak’s departure, Egypt will have to build a stable government of its own.
It also remains to be seen how cooperative the United States and the new Egyptian government will be, as Mubarak was a United States ally for much of his rule, although Obama did call for him to step down towards the end of the protests.

With an infectious bass line, pounding drums and catchy guitar riffs, this track is actually something the band wrote before the release of 2004’s platinum rock opera American Idiot.
“Cigarettes and Valentines” was part of an entire album that the band recorded around 2003 only to find that all of its tracks had been stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording everything, they felt they could step out of their comfort zone and try something entirely different from their past repertoire. Hence, American Idiot was born.
The new track certainly seems more reminiscent of Green Day’s older material from the ‘90s, but it still channels their evolution over the years masterfully. “Cigarettes and Valentines” will be one of 17 tracks on the DVD which will be bundled up with a 16 song live album to be released on March 22, 2011.
The tracklists for both options are impressive but also slightly upsetting considering that Green Day was playing sets that spanned over three hours and were made up of 35-42 songs.
Still, this album will transport fans back to the fantastic memories of seeing a revolutionary live band like Green Day and will give music fans who have not had a chance to see the band live a small sampling of their madness.
In the spirit of Green Day’s furiously energetic live shows, the bundle is aptly titled “Awesome as F***” and is available for pre-order now through iTunes and Amazon.

USG presidential candidate Monish Tyagi has been accused of breaking several articles of the USG elections code because of a Facebook photo that USG vice presidential candidate Rohan Mehra alleges was taken at a party that looked like it might have had “significant amounts of alcohol present and being consumed.”
The alleged violation in the will be discussed at a hearing later today.
Mehra submitted a complaint and  two photos that show Tyagi at a party wearing his campaign T-shirt. No alcohol is visible in the submitted paperwork. The complaint says the pictures were taken Friday and posted the next day.
This could violate articles of the USG elections code that say that campaign materials must be used in an approved manner and that violation of this is subject to immediate removal of the materials and/or sanctioning by the Elections Commission. The elections code also says, “The consumption or distribution of alcohol at any event related to a candidate’s campaign (or which has any campaign materials present) is strictly prohibited.”
Mehra, who is running with Alex Fadil, filed the complaint at 10:07 a.m. Monday.
“We want to hear what they have to say at the trial before they  comment, because our allegations could be referring to something that is  worse than what we think it is, or something that is not a big deal at  all,” Mehra said. “We get along very well with Monish and Logan, so we  don’t want to play dirty or do anything bad unless something actually  comes up.”
“Our campaign team was extremely adamant about  filling the complaint,” Mehra said. “Alex was just on his computer with  someone looking over his shoulder, and it just came up into the news  feed.”
In the complaint, Mehra said that appropriate action should be taken against Tyagi.
“We strongly feel as though wearing campaign shirts/having campaign materials at an alcoholic venue at night is not an approved manner for use of materials,” Mehra said in the complaint. “We feel as though there was a definite misuse of material, so sanctions should follow accordingly.”
The complaint will be heard at 9 p.m. in a closed hearing in the USG Office by the five members of the Elections Commission.
Article XII of the Elections Code gives the accused the right to hear the complaint, know the identity of the accuser and defend themselves with witnesses before the Elections Commission determines whether or not an infraction has taken place.
“The commission that we have now was interviewed and selected in October  from a competitive list of applicants,” said Elections and Recruitment  Co-Chair Barb Solish. “Since then, we’ve had weekly meetings to go over  all aspects of the code, go over previous cases and create possible  future cases where we deliberate and come up with potential sanctions.”
“All verdicts and sanctions will be emailed to the parties within 24 hours of the deliberation,” said an email from the Elections committee.
Fadil and Mehra said they do not want to make the charges they filed “a big deal.”
Candidate Eric Burse noted that all of the USG presidential candidates met before the elections cycle began and agreed to talk to one another first if an elections violation should arise and not file immediately.
“Rohan obviously thinks this is a significant violation of elections code if he is filing,” Burse said.
Current President Chris Cheng, whose sanctions last year resulted in 10 of their Trousdale signs being removed for two hours, said that the charges were part of the “learning experience” of running a campaign.
“It taught us that keeping track of details really helped us out in running our administration to keep an eye out for the rules and to make sure that everything went according to protocol,” Cheng said. “It helped us know now to make things run smoothly this semester and last semester.”
“It didn’t affect our campaign too much, because we just kept campaigning really hard all day,” Cheng said.
“Our competitors didn’t make it a point to get across to people, so they played fair as well,” said Nehi Ogboeven, current Vice President.
“A lot of these campaigns have a ton of volunteers and with those huge support networks, there’s a lot going on,” Cheng said. “The campaign was probably one of the biggest things we organized, so to keep an eye on everything can be really difficult.”
“We encourage all the candidates to continue to be diligent about their campaigning process,” Cheng said. “Make sure you know the rules backwards and forwards, and train your volunteers to run the cleanest campaign as possible.”
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that his accuser said the photo “was taken at a party with ‘significant amounts of alcohol present and being consumed.'” The accusation was that it appeared alcohol might have been present. 
I don’t know what’s worse, the fact that this is being investigated or the fact that the competitor that initiated the investigations is acting like this is not a big deal, that they could care less either way. That kind of attitude is so two-faced to me, I wouldn’t vote for Mehra on that alone. If you want to make a big deal about another candidate regarding a party where alcohol may have been consumed, then act like it’s a damn big deal because you’re sure as hell making it a big deal. Give your potential voters more credit. 
Either way, it’s a sleazy way to win and nothing is going to change that. I would never strive to win on a technicality, and I would hope no other Trojan feels that way, but that’s just me. This is nothing new, the USG has always been a drama-full entity, even in my time.
USG vice presidential candidate Rohan Mehra alleges was taken at a party that looked like it might have had “significant amounts of alcohol present and being consumed.”
“We want to hear what they have to say at the trial before they comment, because our allegations could be referring to something that is worse than what we think it is, or something that is not a big deal at all,” Mehra said.
Candidate Eric Burse noted that all of the USG presidential candidates met before the elections cycle began and agreed to talk to one another first if an elections violation should arise and not file immediately.
“Rohan obviously thinks this is a significant violation of elections code if he is filing,” Burse said.
Above are the quotes from DT reporting….. What a joke….. Mehra, grow up and learn to keep your words and agreements.
And Burse…. you sure played smart ha..ha..ha….
what a joke.  i know none of these people involved, but a simple facebook search of each tells me this is great example of less popular greeks making a weak, low-blow attempt to undercut their better known competitors.  “they do not want to make the charges a ‘big deal'”- i call bs.  get over it and play fair.
Mehra sounds like a faggot. Hope he looses
DT Mods, do your job!
agreed — slurs like that do not belong on a news site
obviously your a complete loser also
DT Mods, what is so difficult about implementing a system in which those who comment submit legit email addresses, or use their Facebook profiles to comment? So many online media already implement this so to preclude crass communication, and to promote civil communication. 
This coward, “God,” likes to hide behind a computer via an anonymous pseudonym and label others “faggot” and “loser.”
“God,”
I really hope you are not a Trojan, and if you are, I only urge you to represent our school better, as a Trojan. I agree with your general opinion, but there are better ways of expressing it than with slurs. We are Trojans, we can express our opinion intelligently.
This is a joke right? “at a party that looked like it might have had ‘significant amounts of alcohol present and being consumed.'” The fact that a candidate filed a complaint about alcohol that ‘may or may not’ have been at a party proves his or her lack of judgement and common sense. I am embarrassed for the campaign that filed this. If the mentioned candidate was photographed surrounded by crack smokers, then you should have a problem.

Senior Maria Sanchez had seen Aeriel Ellis before. 
As a matter of fact, they’ve sparred against each other numerous times over the last ten years.
This time, however, Sanchez would walk away with not one, but two victories against her rival. 
Her play would help lead the Women of Troy to a 6-1 victory over No. 20 Texas.
“There are always subplots to these things,” said USC coach Richard Gallien. “They both know each other, [they’re] both from Northern California, and these things go back a long way. I’m not saying they have a grudge against each other, but it is a hairier sort of deal.” 
Paired up with freshman Kaitlin Christian, Sanchez staved off a late rally from Ellis and her partner Krista Damico to steal the doubles match early on in the Sunday afternoon showdown with the Longhorns. 
The Ellis/D’Amico tandem roared back after falling into a 5-0 hole in the match’s only set, only to be beaten 8-6 when Sanchez and Christian finally reclaimed the momentum late in the game. 
In her singles game, the USC captain overpowered the diminutive Ellis with her strong serve and mighty forehand, winning the only two sets of the match. 
Despite her impressive display, victory didn’t come at an easy cost for the nation’s No. 3-ranked player, as Ellis continued to battle back throughout the match, taking Sanchez to the brink in the second set before bowing out in a 6-3, 7-5 defeat.  
Sophomore Danielle Lao stepped up Sunday afternoon, matching Sanchez’s two wins on the day, and dispatching what could be Texas’ most talented player in Krista Damico. 
Unlike the Longhorn’s volatile junior, Lao played under control and with great pace all afternoon, keeping Damico off balance with low balls to counter her powerful strikes and pressuring her into a plethora of unforced errors.
After teaming with senior Lyndsay Kinstler in a dominant 8-2 win over Texas’ No. 3 doubles squad of Juliana Gajic and Caroline Larsson, Lao was able to beat back a Damico rally to take the first set, then needed a furious rally to secure the second set, winning the last four games of the match to close out a 6-3, 6-4 win.
“She is a really tough player,” Lao said. “I was down 4-3 and needed to step up and execute, especially on her serve, I really focused and concentrated the last three games and got the win.”
Another tough day for junior Allison Ramos once again tested her resiliency and toughness as she had to play a physically imposing opponent for the second game in a row. 
Similar to her defeat against Loreto Alonso of USF, Ramos had difficulty returning the monstrous serve of senior Maggie Mello and that proved to be the difference in a hotly-contested match that ended in an intense, pressure-filled tiebreaker. 
Facing adversity for one of the few times this year, senior Cristala Andrews battled back against the Longhorns’ Cierra Gaytan-Leach to steal a victory, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
In another three-set duel, Christian secured her second win of the day beating Gajic 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 in the fourth singles game, while sophomore Valeria Pulido recovered from her doubles defeat earlier to dominate Texas freshman Elizabeth Begley 6-0, 6-1.
On the day, the Women of Troy would win seven of nine matches.
With an extremely talented UCLA team ahead, this tune-up against Texas helps build momentum and give the team a winning air heading into the meat of their schedule. 
“We are all feeling very confident and feel we’re in a  very good place right now,” Lao said. “It’s all about balance especially in tennis and right now we are really hungry and working hard to compete. We just want it so bad and it’s showing in the results.”
