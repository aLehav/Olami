A diverse group of children’s media creators  — from authors to television show writers — were featured on a panel titled “The Importance of Diversity in Children’s Media” at Wallis Annenberg Hall Wednesday. The event was presented by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in partnership with the Children’s Media Association of Los Angeles. 
Moderator Kirk Damato, a former member of BuzzFeed’s Diversity Council, asked panel members about their journeys to success in the entertainment industry. Chris Nee, creator and executive producer of Disney Channel series “Doc McStuffins” said she was motivated to go into television because of the industry’s lack of representation. 
“I grew up not seeing myself,” Nee said. “And guess what? I still don’t see myself on TV. At the time when I was bringing ‘Doc McStuffins’ to the screen, I still knew that it was not a possibility for me at Disney to be talking about … my LGBTQ family. I made it a part of my mission to find ways to put a spotlight on communities that are not used to seeing themselves because I know how important that is.”
Doreen Spicer Donnelly, writer for Disney Channel sitcom “The Proud Family,” Disney Channel original movie “Jump In!” and novel “Love Double Dutch” said her creative process begins with her experiences and emotions. 
“I didn’t think too hard about what the audience will like or understand,” Donnelly said. “Let me write my story and then people and kids will possibly resonate with it … I wasn’t sure how kids would take it, but I was with 65-plus fifth graders [before I came here tonight], and they all resonate with something.” 
The panelists said kids seek entertainment that immediately excites and poses questions — like adults, children want to experience media that tackles interpersonal relationships and unlimited possibility. Educational programming does not necessarily require shows to teach children about reading and science, they said. Rather, a story about forgiveness or standing up to bullying can teach just as much as a history lesson.
“It’s a time to do something different,” Donnelly said. “We’ve seen the same stories over and over … Now that we’re adding new nuances and different cultures, and something that pops up out of the blue, kids are like, ‘Huh, I never knew that.’ It’s the adults that have a hard time accepting it.” 
Damato also asked panel members about their experiences bringing diversity to the workplace, and what media companies could improve on in incorporating more inclusion. 
“[We have to] bring in different creators,” Damato said. “Otherwise, the same stories will be told to the same audiences, and a lot of people will be left out.” 
Nee spoke about her entrance into the world of television production and recalled how animation was not considered a viable career for people who did not fit the predetermined mold of being white and male. 
“Twenty years ago when I was moving to L.A., I remember actually looking at the credits to see if women were doing animation,” Nee said. “Now, I’m too much of an asshole to not come when I didn’t see any women … I came anyway, but we have to know that we are showing an open door.” 
Children’s book author Lisa Yee has written over 20 children’s books including “Millicent Min Girl Genius” and the “DC Superhero Girls” series. Yee said she does not limit her imagination when writing for a younger audience because she believes that kids are capable of resonating with emotions that all humans feel.
“I think that we need to see more of ourselves and more of the other people who are out there who are different,” Yee said. “When I wrote [‘Millicent Min Girl Genius’] I did not have a political agenda or anything like that. I want to write these stories.” 
Silvia Cardenas Olivas, co-executive producer and head writer for television series “Maya and the Three” and story editor for “Elena of Avalor,” maintains that in order for a scene to strike viewers, it first has to strike the author. 
“Your best stories happen when your eyes are watery, your voice is shaky and your face is red,” Cardenas Olivas said. “And unless you can open up and write about all this you’re not going to connect … Be vulnerable, it’s OK.” 
In closing, Damato expressed optimism for the future of media due to the panelists’ efforts in content creation for children. 
“We’re planting seeds, but I think the trees can grow faster than they used to,” he said. “The landscape in five years is going to be different, [so is] the landscape in 10 years. What a bright 2029.”

If you turned on the radio at any point during the summer of 2017, you were guaranteed at least one play of Kendrick Lamar’s glossiest pop single to date. The track, “LOVE.,” was an ode to meaningful love and featured a triumphant hook from then-unknown artist Zacari.
Now signed to Lamar’s label Top Dawg Entertainment, Zacari attempts to forge a path independent of the prolific MC. However, with the release of his EP “Run Wild Run Free,” Zacari fails to leave a lasting mark on listeners.
The EP isn’t terrible, but it simply doesn’t say enough or present enough originality to warrant further interest in the artist’s growing repertoire. The project explores themes of coming-of-age, self-reliance and relationships. 
The sonic world these tracks inhabit was carefully curated. It is clear the producers’ goal was to neatly tie together these songs, no matter the lyrical subject matter. The problem is that they might have been too successful in doing so. What results is a production so commonplace that it fails to intrigue listeners. Further, multiple tracks borrow elements of the aforementioned collaboration that launched Zacari onto the map.
These tracks, “You Can Do Anything” and “Ten Outta Ten,” blatantly plagiarize the sounds of “LOVE.” This sentiment of replicating other music is further revealed in the lyrical content of the project. “Ten Outta Ten” not only borrows the sonics of “LOVE.,” but also its messages. “You’re ten outta ten, you’re what I wanted,” parallels Lamar’s lyric “sippin’ bubbly, feelin’ lovely.” 
The attempt to soak his music in accessibility continues on other tracks. 
On the Lil Yachty-featured “Young & Invincible,” Zacari covers the exhausted themes of youthful ignorance and its associated bliss. The production is nice enough but again, does nothing to leave a profound impact on the listener. Lyrically, it is highly reminiscent of other songs sharing the same subject matter, often those that have sent the message in more effective ways. Notable is Khalid’s sleeper hit “Young, Dumb & Broke.” Lil Yachty adds nothing more than atmosphere to the track, calling into question the reason for his feature in the first place.
Zacari continues to borrow from other artists on the single “Lone Wolf.” The track features a shoutout to Usher’s “Burn” in the same vein of Kendrick Lamar’s “Sherane a.k.a. Master Splinter’s Daughter,” though he doesn’t do it nearly as successfully and stylishly as his label mate. 
At a concise 21 minutes, the EP is easy to take down — so easy, in fact, that it’s instantly forgettable. Structurally, the opener and closer do well to incorporate themes of growth and independence, but they aren’t enough to sandwich a collection of such neutral tracks.
Zacari still has a lot of developing to do. His voice is strong and unique, but his content lacks originality and innovation to breakout in the growing landscape of contemporary music. 
A Kendrick Lamar feature or high-streaming single are no longer enough to bolster an up-and-coming artist. To guarantee a spot among the talents of TDE, Zacari will need to step it up. For now, “Run Wild Run Free” will collect dust on the shelf as a flop.

Springfest isn’t the only live concert coming to USC this semester. Fem Fest will take place at E.F. Hutton and Founders parks this Sunday with live music, free food and photo-ops that highlight womxn and non-binary artists. Fem Fest is an annual music festival that aims to create a safe environment on campus where people can enjoy music and celebrate diverse voices, festival director Carly Sabicer said. 
This year marks Fem Fest’s seventh year. The event was initially founded by the Women’s Student Assembly, now known as the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, as a reaction to the predominantly male headliners that typically perform at Springfest. 
“There are so many female artists who are just as good and up and coming, we should have a space for them,” said Sabicer, a senior majoring in music industry. 
Some of the performers this year include DJs Lady Soul of Grrrlnight, Kute and Kozi and chipsNicecream as well as the student band Deathless Gods with Human Bods. There will also be a drag performance from USC drag artist Angel Dust. 
Despite its creation as a response to Springfest, Fem Fest’s content and atmosphere is a different approach to campus festivals. 
“I feel like its a lot more like community, like come chill with your friends,” Sabicer said. “And since the artists are more underground, I really enjoy finding out about artists that I didn’t know about.” 
There is more to Fem Fest than just music. Natalie Fox, a junior majoring in English and math, organized a collection of vendors for the festival, including a nail bar, a booth from Homegirl Industries tacos and a sustainable glitter bar.
Inbtwn Magazine, a publication founded by senior Taylor Seamans that explores identity in photography, music, art and writing, will be present with merchandise and copies. Bloom Boutique, a student club that sells thrifted and donated clothing to raise money for local shelters, will be selling clothes at the event as well. 
Sabicer said Fem Fest aims to highlight vendors who aren’t always represented, especially at many on-campus events. 
“[We] are trying to embody what we envision of being inclusive for everybody and really giving us space for people who maybe aren’t always being given a space,” Fox said. 
The festival’s accessibility is also an important part of the event, Sabicer said. Tickets, food and photo-ops are all free of charge with a USC ID. 
“Not everyone can afford to go to Coachella for a weekend and it’s really convenient that [Fem Fest] right on campus,” Sabicer said.
Fem Fest begins at 5 p.m. Sunday. USC students will need to show their ID but will not need to RSVP beforehand. However, non-USC students must reserve a space in order to attend.

Springfest, the annual music and arts concert hosted by USC Concerts Committee, announced on its Facebook page last Thursday that students who bring two canned goods to the festival between 3 and 7 p.m. will gain entrance through a fast-pass lane. They will also be entered in a raffle for a chance to win two passes to local music festivals Stagecoach or Just Like Heaven. 
“We worked with [Goldenvoice] for [Springfest] to get tickets for Stagecoach and Just Like Heaven, and we decided rather than giving them away like we normally do, which is by running some sort of contest, that we would tie it to our social impact project to incentivize kids to participate,” said Concerts Committee Director Kira Stiers, a senior majoring in international relations and political science. 
The canned goods will be donated to the Trojan Food Pantry, which aims to address food insecurity on campus by providing emergency relief to students experiencing food crises. 
This effort is a collaboration among Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate Student Government, the St. Francis Center, Campus Activities and USC Hospitality. 
“Something that’s really challenging with issues like food insecurity is that, often times, these students are hidden from the picture and it’s something that we don’t like to talk about,” USG President Debbie Lee said. 
Students who do not have dining hall plans or have used the totality of their dining swipes and are experiencing food emergencies qualify for assistance from the Trojan Food Pantry. The amount available to students depends on the amount of donations the pantry receives day to day. 
Stiers said students can still bring donations after 7 p.m., noting that the team will keep collecting as long as students keep bringing. The fast-pass lane will be a part of Springfest’s new logistical structure. 
There will only be one main entrance to the concert between the Von Kleinsmid Center and the Social Sciences Building instead of the usual four to five entrances surrounding McCarthy Quad. The entrance will have four lanes, with one lane designated as the fast-pass lane. 
“It’s been very hard to control five or four entrances in the past [at Springfest], and it really spreads our personnel thin,” Stiers said. 
 Joshua Helm, a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering, said students will be encouraged to bring canned goods due to the convenience from donating and incentives.
“I think it’s a really great idea because people are much more inclined to contribute to a cause when it involves something they really enjoy or are excited about,” Helm said. 
The Concerts Committee asks students to bring either canned lentils, brown rice, canned beans, canned mixed vegetables, canned fruits, peanut butter or soup. They ask that none of the canned items contain meat. 
“It’s more so, at this point, about encouraging the spirit of caring for one another, especially among students,” Lee said. 
Springfest will take place on March 30 at McCarthy Quad from 3 to 11 p.m.

When junior Keala Rusher discovered off-campus property management company Mosaic Student Community wasn’t going to reinstall safety bars on her windows, she had concerns.
She posted a screenshot of the email exchange between her housemate and property manager Courtney Jurasko in the “USC Memes for Spoiled Pre Teens” Facebook group.
“Security bars are not promised anywhere in the lease and as a property management company, we never imply or promise the safety of our residents,” the email read. 
Rusher, who is majoring in international relations global business,  said the email dismissed the safety concerns of Mosaic residents. In the Facebook group, the company’s statement was met with harsh criticism. Rusher’s post accrued over 180 comments from students, many of whom shared similar experiences. The post was removed from the page Thursday.
The post was taken off of the page Thursday. Rusher alleged Jurasko reported the post for harassment and it was subsequently deleted.
Students encouraged Rusher to contact the Department of Public Safety with safety concerns and legal counsel for representation.
According to Rusher, the incident began when her housemate, Alejandro Gonzalez, a senior majoring in aerospace engineering, asked for security bars to be replaced on the window after they were taken off for renovations and repairs to the building.
“Mosaic built a small house in the backyard of the house that we are currently leasing and … they re-painted the exterior of our house and in order to do that they had to take off the security bars that were already on the windows,” Rusher said. 
Rusher said that following the recent death of student Victor McElhaney during a robbery attempt near campus, security and well-being became an important concern for her and her housemates.
“I think the email was hostile and unnecessary for one, just to say that they don’t ensure the safety of residents with … but especially callous, insensitive given the recent incident,” Rusher said. “Even though I don’t know the specific details, I feel like it was understandable for us to request safety measures, especially those that were included when we first signed the lease, such as safety bars.” 
In the email screenshot posted to Facebook, Juraso said the property owner was “well aware” of the incident, and “their stance remained firm.”
In the comments, many students wrote that they experienced difficulty with Mosaic’s maintenance of utilities, including the air conditioning, and other residents complained of being forced to live in smaller “closet-like” rooms. 
“They almost moved me into a literal closet-sized room despite the floor plans suggesting otherwise,” one student commented. 
In response to the allegations, Mosaic released a statement addressing the renovations and student concerns.
“Part of the scope of this [renovation] project included removing dated security bars from the property and replacing them with a Ring Doorbell and Floodlight camera system on the exterior of the property, giving residents more knowledge and control over who has access to their home when they are not there,” the statement read. 
In addition to a new security system, the housing company said it is installing new fences to replace the original security system.
“Renovations include … [a] repainting the exterior of the home and adding security fencing between the front of the house and the back of the property,” the statement read. 
DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said that students should consider the safety measures in place before deciding to lease with certain off-campus housing companies. Carlisle said checking the location and security amenities of properties can help students feel safer. 
“If a student feels unsafe, we would be happy to do a quick security assessment of the facility,” Carlisle said. “But, if it is a privately owned properly, the owner has no obligation to conform to what we recommend. But, students can make recommendations.”

Senior Rachel Chiu is making the most out of her four years studying political science. Since February, Chiu has been working as the assistant to the campaign manager for Kamala Harris’ 2020 presidential run in Baltimore. 
Chiu, who is majoring in political science and communication, will be finishing her degree remotely and will graduate in May. 
She described her team as “small, scrappy and hardworking.” As assistant to the campaign manager, Chiu’s job mainly consists of administrative tasks to make campaign manager Juan Rodriguez’s job simpler. 
“If it means that [Rodriguez] needs to have the right briefings in his hand before he’s going to a meeting, that’s what I’m doing,” Chiu said. “If he needs me to pull together a senior staff meeting, that’s what I’m doing. If he needs to talk to someone that’s very important that’s outside of our campaign but very important in the political space, I’m coordinating those meetings.” 
Chiu previously served as a campaign intern for Harris’ 2016 Senate campaign and an intern at SCRB Strategies, a consulting firm which has helped run numerous California campaigns,  including that of Harris. 
Chiu said these experiences paved the way for her current position. She said she was approached about her current position by people she had previously met while working alongside Harris’ campaign. 
“In some ways, I definitely feel extremely blessed and lucky to have [this position] because it kind of landed in my lap,” Chiu said. “But in other ways, it’s also been the culmination of years of commitment and working with the same people and demonstrating that I am willing to do the work and willing put in the effort, and that’s partly why I was given the job.” 
Chiu said she has enjoyed working on the campaign because Harris is down-to-earth and personable. Chiu recalled a time the team was bantering about their favorite musical artists with the senator the day before her campaign launch in Oakland.
“I just remember the day before [the launch] thinking to myself, ‘This is amazing,’” Chiu said. “We’re going to elect this woman to be the next president, and she’s talking about the rapper she likes.” 
Chiu said her parents’ stories of immigrating to the United States strongly influences her work. Her father immigrated from Hong Kong to attend school and her mother immigrated from Vietnam to escape from Communist rule. After arriving, Chiu’s parents struggled to adapt to a new language and culture but eventually found success in achieving the American Dream in a way that Chiu said has greatly shaped her as a person.
“I know it makes them immensely proud to know that after their struggle adapting to a new life here, that they have a daughter who’s working to elect the new president,” Chiu said. “I think about that a lot, and that very much informs the way I do everything.” 
Chiu said her interest in politics began in high school because of the great teachers and mentors that she had.  Her interest in politics and law deepened as she secured other internships in the field. 
Chiu said she feels blessed every day to be serving in her position, but remains uncertain about her future plans.
“I’m very open to the things that will happen, but what I will say is that really look forward to hopefully living in a world where the President of the United States is Kamala Harris,” Chiu said. “That would be great.”  
Dan Schnur, an adjunct professor at the Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism, who has taught Chiu, said he is proud of her capabilities as a student and political advocate.
“It was clear to me from the very beginning that [Chiu] would go on to accomplish tremendous things in politics and public service after she graduated,” Schnur said. “I get to work with a lot of very smart students at USC, but it’s very rare to find someone who’s that smart, that hardworking and with the type of political communication skills that Rachel possesses.” 
Center for the Political Future Director Bob Shrum said he believes Chiu is doing well in her role with Harris’ campaign. 
“[Chiu] is an outstanding student who’s deeply interested in politics,” Shrum said. “The Harris campaign is lucky to have her, and she’ll make a real difference.”

The University is in shambles. For the past two years, USC has been on a runaway roller coaster. 
As an incoming freshman, I witnessed news break about a meth-smoking dean who solicited prostitutes. I thought I had seen it all. What could possibly be bigger than the head of a renowned medical school getting locked up for felony drug charges? Boy, was I wrong.
As a sports journalist, I naturally began to regard USC’s athletic programs as its only stable department. Yes, USC has conducted some shady athletic business with the whole Reggie Bush incident (even though he didn’t play here). I had thought USC Athletics learned its lesson from the harsh sanctions set forth by the NCAA from the violations of the amateurism rules. But once again, I was wrong; more skeletons have been pulled out of USC’s closet. 
In case you haven’t turned on a TV, read a newspaper or talked to literally anyone in the past week, two senior USC Athletics officials were arrested for taking bribes to falsely recruit “athletes” to guarantee students admission into the University. This was the cherry on top to deem USC as the University of Scandals and Corruption. 
This scandal is just the tip of the iceberg, and there has to be more. Meanwhile, the University was hobbling around with an interim president. By no means do I think Interim President Wanda Austin did a poor job, but it’s just hard to believe the University can make significant strides forward while a temp is in charge.
The announcement of a new USC president in Carol Folt really excites me. She knows how to get things done, and specifically how to deal with issues pertaining to collegiate athletics. As the 11th Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she was the face for the clean-up efforts of one of the worst collegiate academic and athletic scandals in history. 
UNC offered “no-show” classes that were abused by both students and student-athletes under the previous three chancellors. She led UNC in the aftermath of the scandal with just a year-long probation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. UNC did not face charges from the NCAA since the NCAA does not interfere with the academic programs of its universities. 
While this issue, similar to USC’s current scandal, is more of an academic problem than an athletic scandal like that involving Bush, it’s important to recognize her expertise in cleaning up the University to ensure that further scandals are prevented.
The most appealing thing about Folt is that she has publicly stated that the decisions she will make at the helm of USC will not be impulsive.
“I’m a scientist and a researcher, so I’m going to do what I have always done,” she said in an interview with The New York Times. “I’m going to gather the facts. So it can’t be any faster than it takes to make thoughtful decisions.”
As mentioned before, there is no way USC is corruption-free. The first step to solving a problem is acknowledging there is one. In this case, USC must acknowledge all of them. Before taking significant action, the entire closet must be clear of skeletons, whether it is Heritage Hall or USC as a whole. 
Perhaps Folt will find that significant leadership changes must be made to USC’s athletics department. 
For the first time in two years, I am optimistic about the future of my university, and other students and alumni should be as well. It’s important to understand that there will be growing pains in this new administration, but as of now, I have full confidence in Folt to discover more issues and properly address them to restore this university to the academic and athletic powerhouse it was.

At the midway point of the lacrosse season, the No. 13 Trojans look poised to make a late season run for the conference title and national championship.  
This year’s team is much improved from the 2018 team that lost to Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship and missed the NCAA championship. The 2019 team is balanced offensively and defensively, ranking No. 21 in scoring offense and No. 19 in scoring defense. 
No team in the NCAA has more players scoring double-digit goals than USC with its seven players. The Trojans also have eight players in double-digit points (goals and assists), tied for most in the NCAA. 
Last year, USC split games with Oregon, winning the first matchup 9-8 in overtime and losing the second 11-18. On Sunday, the Trojans blew the Ducks out 14-5. USC put up five goals in the first seven minutes, never allowing the game to get close.
Junior Kerrigan Miller, the reigning Pac-12 midfielder of the year who led the team in scoring last year, currently ranks seventh on the team in scoring. She still leads the team in caused turnovers and ground balls and is second in draw controls. Her ability to play a role as offensive facilitator without being the leading scorer shows the completeness of this USC team.
“Our team plays to win, yet no win is achievable without trust in one another on both ends of the ball,” Miller said. 
There is no individual Trojan in the top 100 rankings of goals per game, showing that they boast a well-balanced attack in the game with an offense that can dominate in many ways. 
USC is currently ranked No. 20 in the IWLCA coaches poll and has held a ranking on the poll for 47 consecutive weeks. It will look stay on the polls this weekend as it takes on familiar foes No. 19 Stanford and Cal. 
“One of our main goals this year is to take each day at a time,” sophomore midfielder Emily Stallings said. “We have to focus on ourselves every practice and not who we play that weekend. We also have aspirations to win the Pac-12 and make it to the NCAA tournament.”
This weekend match against Cal will mark the 10th regular season match for USC. Last week, No. 23 Colorado and No. 19 Stanford snapped the Golden Bears’ four-game win streak. 
The Trojans have had a successful record against the Golden Bears, with their last game ending in favor of the Trojans, 17-3. That victory has brought USC’s overall record against Cal to a six-game win streak, four of which are double-digit victories for USC. 
This season five Golden Bears are in double-digit goals, led by senior attacker Kirsten Swanson and senior midfielder Eliza Christman, each boasting 20 goals.  
After facing Cal on Saturday, USC will travel to face the Cardinal on Monday. Stanford is coming off wins over Oregon and Cal after suffering an upset loss to No. 23 Colorado at home.
The Cardinal are the fourth ranked opponent the Trojans have faced this season. USC currently owns 17 all-time wins over ranked foes (17-27) with an all-time meeting record of 5-6 against the Cardinals.
Past matches against the Cardinal have not always ended in favor of the Trojans, especially last season, when their devastating loss cost a chance to compete in the final NCAA tournament. 
“After the NCAA selection show last year, we all sat in a room upset after not [hearing] USC called,” Stallings said.
With an intense set of matches this weekend, the Trojans hope not to repeat that feeling and that their hard work from these past few weeks reflects their performance this weekend against Cal Saturday at noon and Stanford Monday at 4 p.m.
