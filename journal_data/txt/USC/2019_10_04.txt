The USC Village Trader Joe’s has changed its previously scattered queuing system into one consolidated line through the middle of the store. Since Tuesday, over 400 students have signed a petition in favor of reversing the controversial decision. 
Until this semester, customers checked out by forming individual lines at each of the store’s eight cash registers.
Now, customers stand in one long queue that stretches through the freezer section and sometimes wraps around to the shelves of alcohol in the next aisle. A Hawaiian-shirt clad employee holds a sign that reads “LINE STARTS HERE,” and shoppers are ushered toward a small set of stanchions before they are pointed in the direction of a cashier. 
Sophie Heukensfeldt Jansen, a senior majoring in business administration, said she started the petition during class Tuesday after weeks of frustration and conversations with friends about the new system. She learned about the mathematical process for calculating wait times — also known as queuing theory — in her Operations Management course last semester, so she understands the store’s reasoning.
“I understand that on paper, one line that splits into multiple cashiers is the fastest way to do things,” Heukensfeldt Jansen said. “In practice, it’s not working out super well. The store is very small.” 
Heukensfeldt Jansen’s friend Emilie Frede, also a senior majoring in business administration, said the Trader Joe’s line had been a running joke among friends since the beginning of the semester. Frede said she called the store to complain one afternoon, and a store employee told her the longest recorded wait time was six minutes. 
RJ Musulas, the store’s manager, said he had not seen the petition and declined to comment further. The Trader Joe’s company did not respond to request for comment.
Frede said that after she called, she began timing how long she stood in line at the store. After waiting for six and a half minutes Tuesday, she told Heukensfeldt Jansen, who decided to take action. Heukensfeldt Jansen posted the petition in the “USC Memes” Facebook group, which drew hundreds of student responses within hours.  
“If you think about it, it does make sense to have one single queue,” Frede said. “But on the flipside … people will see a really long line and be discouraged by it.” 
Frede and Heukensfeldt Jansen said they’ve both stopped frequenting the store as often, especially during peak hours. In a comment on the Facebook post that had 40 likes as of Thursday evening, Ben Brooks, a junior majoring in computer science, jokingly wrote that “the queue reduces wait times” and that “people being intimidated (and leaving) [because] of the queue’s length further reduces wait times.” 
In an interview, Brooks said he was surprised to see the petition, which he hasn’t signed because he didn’t think much of the change when he first noticed it. 
“I didn’t realize [the line] was annoying,” Brooks said. 
The debate around the best methodology for checkout lines has been going on for at least 12 years. When Whole Foods moved to a one-line system in 2007, The New York Times reported that “consumers routinely perceive the wait to be far longer than it actually is” but that the “serpentine” system was ultimately more successful. 
For New York City Trader Joe’s locations, which in 2007 had “far fewer cash registers, lines often snake around the entire perimeter of the store,” according to The Times.
In another Facebook comment, Nick Borquez, a senior majoring in astronautical engineering, called the new system “the most efficient way” to corral customers. In an interview, he said that he had read about queuing theory and decided that a single line made the most sense. 
“It was entertaining to be drawn into this campus-wide debate,” Borquez said. “[It’s] something that really is not so consequential, but also it impacts a lot of people on this campus.”

Laughter and applause echoed through Bovard Auditorium as actor and model Indya Moore and drag queen and senior Angel Dust conversed and answered questions in front of students Thursday evening. 
The event, attended by more than 100 students, was primarily organized by the Queer and Ally Student Assembly but received funding from multiple student organizations, including the Undergraduate Student Government Speakers Committee. 
Moore, best known for their role as Angel on the award-winning FX television show “Pose,” began the event by discussing their career before acting when they faced significant difficulties when getting signed as a model, often working without pay and living on the street. 
“After I was casted in ‘Pose’ and the premiere was released, a lot of things changed,” Moore said. “I was scouted by someone at [modeling agency] IMG.”
While discussing their difficulties as a trans and nonbinary person of color, Moore also stressed the privileges they have been allowed, such as appearing cisgender and being relatively lightskinned.
Since the premiere of “Pose,” Moore has been a vocal advocate for representation in the entertainment industry and for the liberation of marginalized people across the globe. They’ve been on the cover of multiple magazines and this year were included in TIME Magazine’s list of the 100 most influential worldwide.
“It means so much to me that they included me,” Moore said. “Mainstream media culture commands relevancy, so marginalized peoples’ absence from those spaces is further marginalizing and undervalues our membership to society.”
Moore also discussed the issues surrounding representation in entertainment, pointing to recent shows like “When They See Us,” a four-part miniseries about a group of Black boys, known as the Central Park Five, who were wrongfully convicted for the violent rape of a white woman in the 1980s. 
“The actors are overwhelmingly celebrated for performing trauma for the entertainment culture,” Moore said. “But still very little to nothing is done about the issues that the stories around our marginalization are about.”
During a question and answer session at the end of the event, one student asked Moore what they do to cope with the trauma they experience while acting and how they stay sane.
“I don’t,” Moore responded. “It’s very hard, and I’ve underestimated how taxing performative art is greatly. You’re literally loaning your vessel to the spirit of a character that was created.”
QuASA co-director Steven Vargas, the event’s lead organizer, said he wanted to bring Moore to campus because they are a vocal advocate for trans people of color. 
At a red carpet event last month, Moore wore earrings and held a frame depicting the faces of 17 black trans women who have been murdered in the United States this year. Moore often speaks about widespread injustice on their social media, as well. 
“The things that they put on social media, I’ve noticed its been not only entertaining but educating on their life and what it is to be a nonbinary actor in Hollywood,” Vargas said. “They don’t just speak about the trans community, they also speak about the intersectionality of being a trans person of color.”
Pilar Lee, a freshman majoring in journalism, said she enjoyed how genuine and thoughtful Moore was in their responses throughout the evening. 
“Their laugh brought me so much joy,” Lee said. “They’ve been through what seems like about everything in the world, but have still come to find this place of happiness.
