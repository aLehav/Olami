After their $70 million donation to USC to form the Iovine and Young Academy in 2013, Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young have announced an online program for master’s students: Design@USC. 
Undergraduate students in the Iovine and Young Academy currently receive a bachelor of science in arts, technology and the business of innovation. Design@USC follows a similarly interdisciplinary nature, offering an 18- to 24- month master of science in integrated design, business and technology. The program is catered toward recent graduates and professionals with an interest in the intersection of those industries, and the estimated yearly cost is under $70,000 excluding health insurance.
The curriculum was designed by faculty across several schools, including the Roski School of Art and Design, the Viterbi School of Engineering, and the Marshall School of Business. The 38 credits comprise a variety of classes, including directed research and two in-person residencies.
The program has three annual cohorts, the first beginning this August. All Design@USC applicants are required to submit a short video explaining a solution to a problem or need and are recommended to send a portfolio. 
According to the program’s website, Design@USC emphasizes collaboration through a virtual campus, which is used to submit assignments, network and attend classes. The program offers weekly online meetings and critique classes, in which students talk via video chat. Sessions are not meant to be lectures, but rather spontaneous and discussion-heavy to promote interdisciplinary learning.

The audience at Tommy’s Place was held spellbound as Carrie Zhang strummed on her ukelele and poured her heart into a song dedicated to her immigrant parents. The performance was part of Saturday’s TEDxUSC, an event where students, alumni and professors took the stage to talk about causes important to them, as well as the community at large. 
The event was an independent program inspired by the national series, known as TED Talks, that are designed to spread ideas through speakers and presentations. TEDxUSC was hosted in conjunction with USC Academic Culture Assembly, Undergraduate Student Government and USC Program Board.
Victoria Garrick, a sophomore majoring in journalism and a USC volleyball player, spoke about the prevalence of mental illness among student-athletes, as they try to juggle school work, family, social life and sports at the same time. She emphasized the importance of constantly evaluating athletes’ mental health, so that they can lead a healthy lifestyle.
“If you think about it, the culture of athletics preaches, ‘Where there’s a will, there’s a way,’ ‘The best don’t rest,’ ‘Unless you puke, faint or die, keep going,’” Garrick said. “Mental illness is associated with weakness. To appear weak is the last thing an athlete wants.”
Zhang, a junior majoring in public relations, performed a song on her ukulele as a tribute to her Asian American family, most notably her parents, and the struggles they had to go through to build a successful life in the United States. 
“Thank you so much for the sacrifices you made and making me into the person I am today,” Zhang said. “I hope I get to tell your story of immigrating to the United States, and the story of us and how we came to be in my future endeavors.”
The conversation shifted to the global level as speaker Stefani Mikov  discussed her ideas on Syrian refugee camps, notably her engineering contributions toward refugee housing. She and her team worked on constructing shelters, minimizing the distance to basic community needs such as providing water access, maximizing living space and designing for privacy.
“In the 21st century, no one should be living in refugee camps,” Mikov said. “That’s why I wanted to create a community … where people share their fears and their hopes. That’s why our design is not only adopting an engineering perspective, but also an ethical perspective.”
The shelter design not only incorporates coffee shops, where people will be able to sit with their neighbors over a cup of coffee, but also mosques and other religious centers where people will be able to pray.
The event concluded with professor Jeremiah O’Brian talking about the hardships he faced in life — from growing up with no father and a mother with mental illness to being practically illiterate in high school and eventually advancing his education with the help of mentors and professors. He said that his role model and hero was Rocky Balboa, from the movie Rocky, because the character taught him how to get back up after being beaten down.
“Whoever you are, find your hero, find your Rocky — I don’t care if it’s in person or a film, one or many, it doesn’t matter,” O’Brian said. “It just matters that you have a hero you identify with and who inspires you to something more. Then, become your own hero.”
Senior international exchange student Youngwon Moon said the TEDxUSC talk was a way for her to explore U.S. culture and see how American views and values differed from Korean ones.
“Because I’ve never lived in the U.S., it’s hard to know about what people think,” said Moon. “If I hear these thoughts [in the TEDx talk,] I can feel how it’s different.”

Six months ago, Thuy Truong was diagnosed with cancer. 
Two months after her diagnosis, Truong, a USC alumna, met Peter Kuhn, a founding faculty member of the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience. By applying her 10-year background in computer science, Truong began working on projects aimed at raising the quality of life for cancer patients.
“We had two projects, and we were working on them for two years,” Truong said. “Now, we thought, ‘Let’s have 20 projects happen in one weekend.”
That was the inspiration behind Hack for Health, a hackathon designed to foster innovation in cancer treatments.
Truong worked with Jorge Nieva, her physician and an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, to design the event.
“I convinced [Nieva] to do a hackathon together,” Truong said. “This is because I want to find some way to improve the quality of life. I want to have more people pay attention to cancer and I want to cure the disease a lot faster.”
The weekend-long hackathon from April 7 to 9 connected physicians, cancer survivors and coders to students from diverse disciplines. In teams of five people or fewer, the students were challenged to create projects aimed at solving a problem that cancer patients face through technology and programming.
Each student from the top three teams was awarded a prize of $3,000 and automatic acceptance to the program hosted by the Bridge Institute, a summer-intensive program hosted by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences that provides students with mentorship and support to develop the final project produced at Hack for Health.
The interdisciplinary approach to solving cancer is not far-fetched. According to Nieva, cancer is just as much of a data problem as it is a biological problem. 
“You can imagine that if you are a cancer patient trying to figure out your own stage, it’s kind of hard,” Nieva said, addressing the students at the opening ceremony. “So, [for] someone who isn’t good at looking at data, that can be a hard thing to actually do.”
The high demand for streamlined technology working to solve cancer, Nieva said, is due to the infinite different forms of the disease, which scientists in different fields must work together to solve.
“[Biology is] not important to you,” Nieva said. “What’s important to you is that this is all a data problem. I need you people to solve the data problem because frankly, I don’t know how to do it.”
Although the ultimate goal is to find a cure for cancer, most students looked to simplify the treatment process. After speaking to a mentor, who was also a cancer survivor at the event, one team decided to build a prediction tool and a timeline that tracks the effectiveness of drug therapy.
“We had a cancer patient tell us that she took so many drugs that when the doctor asked her what kind of drugs she took and when she took them, she couldn’t remember,” said Edward Hu, a sophomore majoring in computer science. “We’re building a timeline, a nice way for the doctor or you to see where you started your drug and where you ended your drug.”
Other teams’ creations included a chemotherapy calendar for patients, a match program for clinical trials and tools aiming to strengthen mental health of cancer patients. 
Another problem cancer patients face, Nieva added, is their aspiration to preserve their legacies. People want to tell their stories, and they want to tell things to their children and grandchildren.
“Few of them know the elements of storytelling,” Nieva said. “And I know people here at USC know the elements of storytelling. That has nothing to do with curing cancer, but it has everything to do with life.”
Through collaboration with cancer survivors during meal breaks and Saturday’s Yoga with Cancer Patients module, students were able to apply real-life circumstances to their coding projects.
Apoorva Dhakras, a master’s student studying computer science, believes the impact of the event stems from its real-world application.
“We have done a lot of theoretical stuff in the master’s,” Dhakras said. “We have learned how things work, but this would be a good platform to actually implement things and build something that will make a difference.”
Dhakras’ teammate, Disha Parek, also a master’s student studying computer science, chose to participate in Hack for Health for its narrow focus and mission.
“It’s about someone’s life,” Parek said. “Technology can help in some way or the other. I’m working on technology, but something where I can touch lives and make something out of it.”

On the ball · Sophomore pitcher Marrick Crouse winds up to pitch. Despite strong pitching, the Trojans dropped their series against Stanford. Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
Despite winning their first game, the Trojans dropped two out of three games to Stanford this weekend. The series started off strong for USC with a 7-5 victory. However, the Trojans (16-14) were unable to take the series from the Cardinal (17-10), dropping the next two games 8-3 and 6-3. The team is now 5-7 in Pac-12 play . 
Freshman starter Chris Clarke was impressive in seven innings of work on Thursday night, giving the bullpen a much-needed rest. He recovered after giving up a home run to Stanford leadoff batter Matt Winaker in the first inning and did not seem to be rattled by the Cardinal offense. 
“That might be the first time we’ve gotten seven [innings] out of a starter all year,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “I thought Chris did a good job. He was able to get them out on the change-up, breaking ball and fastball. Two-strike execution is going to be a big part of his development and being able to locate inside.”
Redshirt sophomore reliever Bryce Dyrda pitched two innings of scoreless ball to extend his scoreless inning streak to 21. He earned his fourth save of the year, striking out four of six batters. 
The Trojans seemed to have broken out of their hitting slump, scoring seven runs on 12 hits. 
Sophomore second baseman Brandon Perez led the surge, starting the third inning with a double down the right field line, scoring senior designated hitter David Edson. Sophomore center fielder Lars Nootbaar followed with a single, bringing Perez to the plate. 
“Offensively, I thought we did a really good job,” Hubbs said. “Brandon had the big double down the line and Lars followed it up with a hit. I was excited about how the offense swung it.” 
Senior catcher Cris Perez tied the game in the fourth inning with a home run. The Trojans broke out that inning, scoring four runs. Edson brought home the go-ahead run on a single, followed by an RBI single from Brandon Perez and a sacrifice fly from Nootbaar. 
“I think the biggest difference today and the last four or five games is that the guys were able to hit line drives instead of fly balls,” Hubbs said. “If we can do that, we can get more hits.”
The Trojans picked up an insurance run in the eighth inning with Nootbaar’s fifth home run of the season. 
Despite their success at the plate in the first game, the Trojans were unable to put together the same number of runs over the next two games. 
They kept it close until extra innings in Friday’s game. 
The Trojans got out to an early lead, when redshirt junior shortstop Frankie Rios singled with the bases loaded in the bottom of the first inning to score a run. 
Sophomore starter CJ Stubbs gave up three runs — one earned — over his six innings of work.
The Trojans tied the ballgame in the bottom of the sixth inning with a two-run single by sophomore first baseman Dillon Paulson. 
Sophomore reliever Quentin Longrie finished with the loss, despite pitching 2 1/3 scoreless innings with three strikeouts. He didn’t allow any batters to reach base until the 10th inning, and even then the ball did not leave the infield. 
Dyrda came in in relief and let the go-ahead runs score, with the Trojans falling 8-3. He lost his streak of 21-straight scoreless innings streak. Despite the poor outing Friday, Dyrda had been spot-on for the Trojans. 
“He has a good fastball and has been able to spot it up real well and mix in the curve and change when he needs to,” Hubbs said. 
The rubber match on Saturday felt similar to Friday’s game. Again, the Trojans got out to an early lead but lost it late in the game.
Sophomore starter Marrick Crouse went 6.2 innings, giving up three runs on seven hits. 
All three starters of the Stanford series went at least six innings, a big positive for the team. Previously, the starters had struggled early in the game, resulting in an overworked bullpen. 
“We needed more of our starters going deep into the game to not wear our bullpen down,” Hubbs said. “When you’re having to use your bullpen as much as we have the past week, it’s taxing on them. To lessen the innings that everyone else has to do means that we will be fresher for the next game.”
Paulson hit his first home run of the season in the bottom of the first inning to give the Trojans the lead. 
Crouse gave up a run on an RBI single in the third, but the Trojans retook the lead on a sacrifice bunt by Dempster in the bottom of the fifth. 
Crouse was relieved by freshman Austin Manning, who had a blip in his strong season. He gave up three runs in just 0.2 innings of work, giving way to junior reliever Brad Wegman. 
The Trojans tried to get their bats going in the bottom of the ninth and managed a run on a sacrifice fly by freshman pinch hitter Stephen Dubb. However, they fell to the Cardinals again 6-3. 
The Trojans will next face No. 10 Cal State Fullerton on Thursday at Dedeaux Field at 6 p.m. 
Coach Hubbs has no idea how to use his bullpen. Saw the Saturday game. Ask him why he left Manning in to pitch
to a right handed batter after he failed to get out the left handed batter to end the inning. Wegman should have been
used then.

Now that college basketball is over, the countdown to football season officially begins. While we are still a long summer away from fall camp and the start of the season, spring football always provides an exciting glimpse into the future. 
This year is no different, especially at USC, where some former highly touted recruits are making a name for themselves. This seems to be an annual trend for Trojan players. As the team restocks its talent reservoirs, there will be more spring standouts than ever as pieces begin to fall into place for Helton’s second season at the helm.
In the past, the springtime has been a showcase for talent and potential. While some players who shined in spring ball failed to make a similar impact in the regular season, such as  Isaac Whitney and De’Quan Hampton, others have used the 14 sessions to stake a claim for their future starting spot. 
Last spring, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold had everyone talking on a daily basis. His skills and in-game ability were evident every time the ball was snapped, and it was obvious that it was only a matter of time until he took the helm as the starter. 
This year is a bit different for Darnold. Instead of surprising everyone with his immense talent, he enters the spring as a Heisman trophy frontrunner and potential first pick in the 2018 draft, earning serious hype at this year’s NFL Combine despite the fact that he won’t be eligible to attend until next year.
While hopefully he stays for more than just this year, his performance thus far has only added to the growing hype. Many preseason media darlings struggle to adjust under the bright lights, but Darnold seems to be excelling in this role and leading the team. Barring injury, his sophomore campaign could be one for the record books.
Darnold certainly highlights and accentuates the talent around him, but he is blessed to have a diverse and dynamic receiving corps. The Trojans will miss Darreus Rogers’ dependability and JuJu Smith-Schuster’s raw power and playmaking skills, but the team seems to have a few different stars in the making during spring ball.
If his Rose Bowl performance — and excellent November before that — didn’t cement junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett’s status as an excellent wideout, this spring is certainly helping. Burnett came in with the reputation of a burner, but what is really impressive is his sure-handedness and knack for finding openings in the defense. 
The fact that he has blazing speed is just an added bonus, as the Darnold-Burnett combination looks to be even better than it was last season, which should have defenses concerned.
In addition to Burnett, sophomore wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. may be able to step in and make some of the plays that Smith-Schuster and Rogers have been making for the Trojans over the last few years. Pittman is exceptionally strong in his position, and flashed glimpses of his potential last season, especially in the rout of Oregon. This spring, he has continued to refine his route-running skills and will be a handful for defenses in the fall.
The Trojans are much deeper than just those two. Redshirt freshman wide receivers Tyler Vaughns and Velus Jones are showing the Trojan fanbase why they were both so heavily recruited as members of the 2016 class, and they should give those fans something to look forward to for the future.
Vaughns, a five-star recruit, is in the mold of recent standouts like Nelson Agholor and Marquise Lee, with a potent combination of size and athleticism. Jones has similar speed as last year’s Thorpe Award winner Adoree’ Jackson, but packs quite the punch, as he weighs 185 pounds. Both are raw, but the potential for greatness is clearly there, and Helton will have a lot to work with as he molds these two players.
Finally, the Imatorbhebhe brothers are the real deal. I cannot imagine how many high school defensive coordinators in Georgia had ulcers trying to devise game plans to stop both of them. The elder brother, Daniel, has already made a name for himself as the most sure handed and explosive tight end at USC since either Fred Davis or Dominique Byrd. His younger brother, Josh, was actually the more heavily recruited of the pair, and he is living up to his billing this spring, making life difficult for opposing defensive backs. The pair will help to buoy an already brutal air attack for the Trojans.
The Trojans are lucky to have so much depth in the wideout and tight end positions, and with Darnold slinging the ball around next fall and a crop of excellent running backs, the Trojans have the makings of a truly spectacular offense that could prove to be exceptionally difficult for opponents to beat in the upcoming season.
The defensive side also has some standouts, especially along the outside of the defensive line. Senior inside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu has been an absolute matchup nightmare so far, and junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin is equally fearsome on the opposite side. 
If some of the young interior tackles can come in and make an impact right away while buoying the defensive line with junior Rasheem Green and redshirt senior Kenny Bigelow, the Trojans will once again have a fast and attacking defense that is just as dazzling for USC fans as the offensive unit.
This spring is proving that recruitment and player development both matter. Head coach Clay Helton and his staff have done an excellent job bringing in talent and coaching the players up, and it is clearly elevating the level of play. Of course, spring doesn’t mean much in comparison to the fall, but it is encouraging to see the Trojans looking great thus far.

After a year and a half of winning, the Trojans’ streak is officially over.
The No. 1 women’s water polo team brought a record-breaking 52-game win streak into their game against No. 2 Stanford on Saturday. But the Cardinal came out swinging and never let up, holding on to an early lead to break the Trojans’ streak in a 12-8 final.
From the start, Stanford took advantage of every opportunity for a mismatch on offense. The Cardinal scored off their first 6-on-5 power play, then quickly stretched out to a 3-1 lead in the first quarter. With the Trojans on their heels, Stanford found the pulse of play and kept a hold on their lead through smothering defense.
The Trojans found some success in the second quarter, attacking the net to bring the deficit back to only two goals at the end of the half. That momentum carried into the second half with senior Ioanna Haralabidis slotting a shot into the top right corner of the Stanford goal to bring the Stanford lead to 7-6.
But from there, the Cardinal clamped down on defense, showing a new defensive structure with two defenders closely flanking the goalkeeper to efficiently block any chance at a USC attack. Meanwhile, the Stanford offense found quick rhythm and jumped ahead to a 12-6 lead. Although the Trojans were able to find the back of the net two more times when Stanford rotated in younger players, it was simply too little, too late for the top-ranked team.
The difference between the two teams was a solid stand on defense by the Cardinal, which thwarted the Trojans’ ability to attack both down low and from farther out. Stanford goalkeeper Gabby Stone was at the heart of this defense, recording 11 blocks on the night. Although USC is used to pounding the ball down low through Games, Stanford was stalwart in playing physically — yet within the rules — in the post. The Cardinal also effectively shut down the Haralabidis twins, holding the dynamic duo to a combined 3 points.
For the Trojans, sophomore keeper Amanda Longan did her part by notching seven blocks throughout the game. But the Cardinal remained clean in their attack, moving the ball consistently to find open looks at the net. The Trojan defense didn’t have a solution for the Stanford attack from mid-range, and without an answer on offense, the loss was inevitable. 
Now, the Trojans have fallen to No. 3 in the Pac-12 standings. The team didn’t lose for the entirety of the 2016 calendar year, including last year’s NCAA championship title game. The 52-game streak was the longest in NCAA women’s water polo history, beating out the previous record set by UCLA from 2007 to 2009.
The team will return to face off against Cal next weekend in search of redemption for Saturday’s rare loss. The game against Stanford was the the Trojans’ final home stand of the regular season, and with the Pac-12 championships and the NCAA playoffs looming, the team will look to rebound quickly. 
Although this was the final game for the Trojans in their home pool, it most likely won’t be their last game against Stanford if this season follows the course of past years. The teams are expected to face off as the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds for both the Pac-12 championship and the NCAA championship. The next time they meet, the Trojans will be building toward a new streak and looking for one thing — redemption.
Your headline is completely wrong. The streak was snapped after 52 games. A team does not snap their own streak.

Founders Park sparkled with girl power on Saturday afternoon with deep purple shirts, colorful displays of neon art and vibrant buttons emblazoned with the Venus symbol.  There, USC hosted its fifth annual FemFest, a festival that advocates for local female musicians and artists with a focus on intersectional feminism.
“This event started in 2013 as a response to the heavily male-dominated events such as Springfest, which happened again this year — it was a mostly male event,” FemFest Co-director Allegra Rosenberg said. “FemFest exists to give alternative female-led music a platform at USC.” 
FemFest is a successful production thanks to USC’s Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, combined with efforts from Undergraduate Student Government and MUSE, an organization that promotes women’s music in the USC community. These three organizations attempt to educate and expand the community of socially minded activists on campus as well as introduce new artists.
“I honestly love seeing all the bands, and I was really motivated by making this local,” Rosenberg said. “These are all really amazing local bands that come together to form this awesome local community, and I’m so excited to showcase that at FemFest.” 
Bands that performed at FemFest included HOLYCHILD, a popular indie pop duo, as well as folk artist Miya Folick and DJ sets by Emmieshouse and Girlschool. Each musical act brought new dimensions to female power, demonstrating each of their backgrounds, stories and styles.
One of the highlights of the lineup was Inti Wawa, a Peruvian multi-instrumentalist whose genre is described as “Andean Pop” and “South American Folk Fusion” on her website. She and her accompanying musicians played a high-energy acoustic set that explored her familial history through language and explanatory interludes.
 Along with the musical performers, FemFest also featured several other activities and vendors geared towards community engagement. One of these vendors was Whitney Bell, who owns her own intersectional feminist store, Kidd Bell. She sells crop tops with “Resist” embroidered on the collars along with buttons, dresses and stickers that aligned with her powerful, open message of hope for feminism in face of adversity.
“We always want to get more college students involved,” Bell said. “This seemed like the perfect opportunity.”
Kidd Bell opened just over six months ago and has already been asked to open up pop-up shops at festivals and colleges.
“[I love] making stuff that’s relatable to younger girls — getting them excited about feminism — and conversation pieces that get people talking about actual issues,” she said.
Bell’s merchandise focuses on female empowerment. At her booth, customers asked about future items and planned outfits with Bell as they browsed the racks and tables.
FemFest also featured a glowing neon paper piano keyboard where people could write and decorate notes about their feminist passions as well as a therapeutic sand art station. Other vendors decked out their tables with more FemFest merchandise, while interested attendees grouped on cozy blankets on the lawn.
As the evening progressed, fairy lights and neon post-its framed the final act of the night, HOLYCHILD, whose message of strength and unity left the audience with a sense of hope towards a more educated campus community.

Among authors of young adult fiction, Geanna Culbertson must be one of only a few to have become a superhero in her real life. An alumna of the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Culbertson has successfully mounted two careers: one as the author of the Crisanta Knight series and another working full-time for a digital marketing firm.
“That’s my full-time work — my 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., as it were,” Culbertson said. “But [being a writer] is what I moonlight as. And I can say that with accuracy, since I do it when the moon is out. 
Every weekday, Culbertson wakes up at 3 a.m. to write before going to work. Despite being only two years out of college, Culbertson has published two novels, the beginnings of an eight-book series.
Culbertson has been captivated by storytelling from a young age. She wrote her first story when she was six years old. As she grew up and entered college, she found less time to devote to creative writing. However, Culbertson said she sees the time she spent on academic writing as an important part of her maturation as an author.
“Everything that you do in terms of writing contributes to your greater craft,” Culbertson said. “So, whether I was writing a history of Alexander the Great for a history class or a political science paper, it all builds your strength and your skill.” 
Now, without any coursework making demands on her free time, Culbertson’s love for writing continues to drive her.
“That moment when I wake up at 3 a.m. every day and it’s black — it’s simultaneously the worst but also the best part of every one of my days,” Culbertson said. “The nights before, I’m dreading I have to get up again, but also I’m excited, because I love writing so much, and this series is such a huge part of me that working on it fills me with enough joy to compensate for the tiredness. That’s how you know you have that thing you love the most.” 
In addition to her writing schedule, Culbertson has put a great deal of thought into marketing her book.
“I’m constantly knocking on doors, reaching out to press, scheduling any little signing and event I can,” Culbertson said.
 For the release of her third book, Culbertson will have the support of her publicist in some of those tasks. That means she can focus more on writing. Culbertson said she already knows what will happen in the rest of the series because she has written parts of the forthcoming books.
“I don’t write in order. I don’t go from point A to point Z,” Culbertson said. “With the entire series, and each book individually, I have a certain amount of plot points worked out … and then I fill in the blanks. So, of all the books which haven’t been written, I have pieces written, and I know the major twists.”
In fact, the seed for the Crisanta Knight series was planted years before Culbertson graduated.
“When I was [at USC], going into my sophomore year, I had this really great idea for concept: the school that’s in my book series, which is called Lady Agnue’s School for Princesses and Other Female Protagonists,” Culbertson said. “I just had that idea, and it was an interesting concept. Around that time, I took a class with Aimee Bender. We were doing so much fairy tale research that it started to grow and I realized the ideas just couldn’t stay in anymore.”
Bender is a novelist and distinguished creative writing professor. Culbertson visited campus on Tuesday to speak in Bender’s class, Classic and Contemporary Fairy Tales — the same class Culbertson took as a student.
Culbertson remains as exuberant about the Crisanta Knight world as the day she first had the idea for Lady Agnue’s School. Culbertson said she thinks recent young adult fiction has lost the whimsical character of the classics, and she wants to reclaim it.
Culbertson’s career is eclectic and her hours are far from typical, but her relentless energy has no mystical origin. She spoke about her artistic goals with clarity and authority, crediting her love of writing for how quickly her career has taken off.
“I don’t drink caffeinated coffee — it’s one of my superpowers, I guess,” Culbertson said. “So maybe someday when I’m like 35 and I need that second wind and I drink coffee, I’ll just be unstoppable!”
The upcoming installment of the Crisanta Knight series will arrive in bookstores this fall.

When I was four years old, my parents converted to Catholicism to heal their marriage. They joined a church-based family counseling program that met every month — and were convinced that embracing their newly found faith would bring our family back together. By default, my brother and I followed suit.
Like any other child, I neither had a say nor did I ever question my parents’ decision to get me baptized. I wasn’t old enough to fully grasp the concept of religion — but what I did know was that I was rewarded for every prayer I memorized in Vietnamese and every rosary I recited before bed.
For over 12 years, I remained active in a variety of programs at my local church, sometimes against my own will. Saturday mornings were reserved for Bible study and Sunday afternoons for Catholic youth scouts and Mass. I wasn’t engaged in bible study because I wanted to have a better understanding of God. I was engaged because I knew it would make parents proud when I memorized the most prayers and had the highest exam scores among my peers. No matter how much I dreaded it, I never complained.
It wasn’t until fifth grade that I finally began to embrace my faith. After becoming an altar server, I went to Mass at least twice a week plus on Sundays. From that point on, I became fully committed to God and Catholicism. And for several years, my life outside of school was completely dedicated to being an altar server and scout leader.
Even when I discovered my sexuality in eighth grade, I didn’t think about it within the context of my religion. Though I knew the Catholic Church did not support homosexuality, I assumed that I would never be affected by it or discriminated against if I just remained silent, continued pursuing my faith and prayed to God daily.
As I grew older, however, it became apparent that this was not the case. These sentiments of guilt, shame and embarrassment began to consume me when I was told by one of my scout leaders that same-sex marriage is unacceptable because it obstructs God’s natural intentions, and that God doesn’t protect gay people. As I became more exposed to the Church’s ideologies, I began to struggle more and more with reconciling my identity with my faith.
The guilt worsened gradually. I spent many of my high school years wondering if being bisexual and Catholic were two mutually exclusive identities. Would God still accept me if I remained who I was? Or would I have to lose a part of myself to go to heaven? My experience and involvement at church was never quite the same after this.
I quit going to youth scouts partly because I was getting busier with high school activities, but the main reason was that I grew uncomfortable with the environment that I was in. I was often teased by other scout leaders for a variety of things, like being a Lady Gaga fan. At one point, I was even told to be less flamboyant and start acting like a man. These small details ultimately pushed me away from church. I didn’t want to be in a place where I was not welcomed, and I couldn’t possibly remain in an organization that implicitly shamed me for being myself.
By senior year of high school, I stopped going to Mass completely. I was finally able to accept myself and be content with who I am — but that ultimately meant sacrificing my faith. In retrospect, I regret making this decision. It’s strange that it took giving up something that was such an important part of my life to finally be in the place that I am today. As I’ve continued to mature, I’ve learned that religion doesn’t just give people something to believe in — it’s also a part of their identity.
Though I still have qualms about the Catholic Church and its ideological stance against the LGBTQ community, I now realize that my faith and beliefs shouldn’t be defined by what people tell me is right or wrong. I’m no longer ashamed of myself, and no longer worried that God won’t accept me. I’ve fully embraced the idea that my identity can be intersectional and that I was brought into this world for a reason. And though I don’t go to Mass regularly anymore, I know that there is a greater force out there looking after me and supporting me through life.
And as long as I am happy with myself, He will also be happy for me.

Last Thursday, the Trump administration launched a military strike on a Syrian government air base in response to a chemical weapons attack that left dozens of civilians dead. The strike marks the first direct military action taken by the United States since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011. The Obama administration, which committed to a strategy of selective engagement that prioritized U.S. interests, quickly backtracked on the possibility of intervention back in 2013.
The effects of violent intervention in Syria greatly relate to students. The displacement of Syrian refugees is an issue many of us are concerned and involved with, either personally or for humanitarian reasons, and the Trump administration’s latest decision will have substantial consequences.
Despite the recognizable differences between the two presidents, it seemed, for many years, that they agreed on at least one thing: The United States should not intervene in foreign conflicts, on humanitarian grounds or otherwise, unless its security interests are directly affected. In September 2013, Donald Trump tweeted, “President Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your ‘powder’ for another (and more important) day!” Moreover, throughout his presidential campaign, Trump emphasized his message of “America First,” claiming that foreign entanglements would be too costly.
As president, why did Trump reject his predecessor’s example and throw out his own foreign policy playbook?
Perhaps images of suffering and dead victims of last week’s attack so moved the president that he felt compelled to act. “When you kill innocent children, innocent babies — babies, little babies,” Trump said, “that crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line. Many, many lines.”
Having established his “red line,” Trump possibly thought that if he backed away, as Obama had, he would be perceived as “weak.” The strike then became a form of political posturing vis-à-vis his predecessor, rather than the product of sudden, intense compassion. This suggestion certainly makes sense, considering Trump’s refusal to provide refuge to Syrian victims or take steps to actively mitigate their suffering.
Perhaps the strike was a signal to North Korea and Iran. Both countries have pursued weapons of mass destruction, much to the chagrin of the United States. An attack in response to the use of chemical weapons projects U.S. power and warns intransigent states of the consequences they might encounter for similar actions.
Perhaps, finally, the strike was a foreign policy distraction. The Trump administration has been criticized repeatedly for its alleged ties to the Russian government. Trump and his team possibly hoped that an attack on a Syrian government air base would convince the public that the United States is not the pawn of Russia — the Syrian government’s perennial ally.
Undoubtedly, for the time being, there remains uncertainty about the motivations behind Trump’s actions. This uncertainty, however, should not be license to apathetically disregard concerns about the president’s evolving foreign policy. We should challenge a president who orders such a strike without the approval of Congress. We should question the effectiveness of a “humanitarian” intervention, in response to innocent deaths, that itself reportedly killed four children. We should organize to provide relief to victims and, with our electoral power, press leaders to pursue diplomatic efforts to solve this crisis.
As students, we should play a role in advocacy. Students Organize for Syria is a campus organization that not only raises awareness about the Syrian crisis but also provides aid to refugees and other displaced persons. Through its Students Teach 4 Syria Program, SOS holds donation drives and events for Syrian refugees who have settled in San Diego. Involvement with SOS is just one example of what USC students can do to promote refugee rights in the wake of the Trump administration’s latest, deeply consequential foreign policy decision.

If your so worried about the Syrian people why are you here ? You and your snowflake friends should be over there you just call yourselves ‘ Students Organize for Syria ‘ to make yourselves feel good. I hate to think what will happen when you leave school and get out into the real world, you won’t have a clue.
Jesus Chr*st!  There have been half-a-million people killed and millions of refugees created under Obama’s watch.  Meanwhile you tell us you are seriously concerned about the refugees.  Then you essentially recommend we do nothing different than Obama’s done.  Do I have this right?
What would you have us do?  Let Russia and Assad do whatever the f*ck they want to do?  Kill more, create more refugees?  Let the Sunnis, Shi’ite, Kurds all kill one another until there’s one man standing?
Let’s face it, no matter what Trump does you will second guess him and criticize him.  No doubt a month ago you were playing up his Russian “associations” and are no doubt ignoring Susan Rice’s.  And Trump’s in-your-face bombing against Russian interests means nothing to you.
To you there is no objectivity, no rational thought.  Yours boils down to Trump bad regardless.  He could move to Syrian and sing Kumbaya with the refugees and you would still second guess and criticize him.
What’s your red-line?
Question Trump. How brave.

A group of USC faculty members led by Gould School of Law professor Ariela Gross purchased a full-page advertisement in the Los Angeles Times, which was published on March 23, after raising $22,120 through a GoFundMe account. The advertisement demonstrated public support for immigrant and international students in light of President Donald Trump’s immigration ban and was signed by over 300 USC faculty members. While the advertisement was a step in the right direction toward protecting diversity at USC, more steps, which this funding could have gone toward rather than the advertisement, must be taken so that USC students do not live in fear because of their nationalities or citizenship statuses. 
Gross hoped the advertisement would inspire the administration to create resource centers specifically for affected immigrants and to establish legal funds for student citizenship issues they may face. However, to more productively work toward this goal, the funding from the GoFundMe account arguably could have gone toward creating resources for immigrant and undocumented students, spurring the availability of these resources to undocumented students at USC.
According to Gross, the goal of the advertisement was “to urge and support our university administration’s effort to protect our students no matter what happens.” While that is an important message to convey, it is not just the administration’s onus to protect USC students. The administration and USC community both have an obligation to protect the rights of students and ensure access to equal, safe education. In this vein, the funding raised by USC faculty could have been devoted to support organizations offering concrete legal services to undocumented students, rather than merely sending a message, albeit an important one.
It is one thing for USC faculty members to say that they will not accept this type of discrimination against immigrants, and it is something completely different to them to actually provide a solution for the issue. Allocating the money from the GoFundMe account to different on-campus resources would have been a more consequential choice than buying the advertisement. It would directly connect undocumented students in need to the resources they otherwise would not have access to. These actions would, like the advertisement, also publicly convey support for undocumented students, while also serving these students’ needs directly. 
One example of what the university faculty could have directed this funding toward is a resource center devoted to providing counseling, support, advisement regarding financial aid and legal assistance to undocumented students. Resource centers for undocumented students exist at many colleges, such as Universities of California as well as the University of Utah, Georgetown University, Harvard University, Western Washington University, San Diego State University, San Francisco State University and the California Polytechnics at San Luis Obispo and Pomona. These centers provide the services low-income undocumented students otherwise would not be able to afford but need in order to safely receive equitable college educations.
Still, the lack of resource centers directly offering legal support for undocumented students on campus does not mean that USC has failed to protect its students. Following the publication of the advertisement, the USC administration has jointly filed, along with other U.S. colleges, an amicus brief in the lawsuit challenging Trump’s immigration ban, supporting its repeal.
The advertisement in the Los Angeles Times is indicative of the bond behind the Trojan Family. However, more concrete action is required. The community must promote discussion and decisively devote funding to programs and resources that international and undocumented students need in order to safely attend USC, and receive an education as meaningful as documented and American peers. USC cannot allow its immigrant and undocumented students to lose their basic human rights, safety and education. Direct assistance through resource centers and legal aid is the way to do that.
