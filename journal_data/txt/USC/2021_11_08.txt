When James Fawcett, an adjunct professor of environmental studies and the director of marine science & policy outreach at the Sea Grant Program, first heard about the Orange County oil spill, his first reaction was “Oh no.” His second reaction was to look for more information about what might have caused the spill.
The oil spill that occurred on Orange County’s beaches released over 25,000 gallons of oil into the seas and shores. The incident, which affected wildlife, business and public safety, became a national news event and prompted responses from state and local officials.
Following the events of the oil spill, officials and organizations, such as the United States Coast Guard and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Office of Spill and Prevention Response, gathered data from high-frequency radar installations and sensors maintained by the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies. This data helps to track ocean currents and detect the color of the water at the California coastline.
The oil spill, which began on Oct. 1, created an oil slick layer that stretched approximately 5.8 nautical miles long from Huntington Beach Pier to Newport Beach. While beaches reopened for swimming and surfing on Oct. 11, fishing remains prohibited until Dec. 1.
The Wrigley Institute currently provides data to officials and organizations who handle climate change issues and environmental policy.
Matthew Ragan works at the Wrigley Institute as the project manager of six radar stations that provide data about oil movement into a national data network located at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, a department of the University of California, San Diego. That data then becomes publicly available to groups like the U.S. Coast Guard and the Marine Exchange of Southern California.
Afterward, the data is put into models that predict what direction the oil on the surface will move.
“[Institutions like the U.S. Coast Guard and OSPR] can use the data then to put into models that start predicting where an oil slick, while it’s at the surface, may move towards,” Ragan said. “Is it going to go onshore, offshore, north, south?”
The radar stations, situated in various locations stretching from Newport Beach to Malibu, also gather data for researchers to help the United States Coast Guard in search and rescue operations and aid Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts in maintaining wastewater pipelines.
Engineering technician Carl Oberg, who helps maintain the equipment used for collecting data runs, said he recognized the importance of seeing whether or not the oil spill will become a threat to people, stressing the significance of figuring out where the oil will end up.
“[The U.S. Coast Guard and OSPR] can use this data a lot for tracking this oil spill. By tracking it with using the ocean currents, they can manage whether it’s going to be moving into, say [an] ecologically sensitive area like a wetland or onto public beaches, where they can notify the population to stay out of those areas,” Oberg said.
Alongside the six radar systems, the institute also maintains a sensor located nine miles from the Huntington Beach shore. The data gathered processes images that indicate ocean color and delivers it to American and European satellites. Images from the satellites can later be used by NOAA to track oil spills, Oberg said.
As the oil spill investigation continues by organizations such as the National Transportation Safety Board and the United States Coast Guard, Fawcett said one theory of the U.S. Coast Guard proposes that a ship’s anchor could have struck an already deteriorating pipeline. 
“It sounds, from early reports, like the alignment of the pipeline was modified, but whether it was modified by physical force or by the action of currents is unknown at this point,” Fawcett said. “I suspect that it probably was some physical cause for its movement.”
Fawcett also suspects that anchoring ships should hold a primary concern for oil spills since anchorage sites are located near the alignment of the pipeline. He said that the steel under the pipeline’s concrete jacket likely became susceptible to corrosion.
“I think the basic lesson for it is that, obviously, vessels need to be very careful to anchor in their assigned spots,” he said. “We don’t normally have so many vessels anchored in the outer harbor. It’s highly unusual to have.”
As part of NOAA and Integrated Ocean Observing System, the Wrigley Institute shares data that allows various groups, such as the Coast Guard and lifeguards, to understand the oil spill’s status. OSPR receives some of that data and uses it to create models that predict ocean currents.
For Ragan, the institute’s data can serve to help officials and organizations be better informed about decisions for more efficient oil spill cleanup. He sees such decision making as contributing to less of an impact on the environment. 
“It’s nice to know that our efforts of keeping things operational lead directly to hopefully a better response,” Ragan said. “In that sense, I’m pleased that we’re able to help contribute.”

Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the Trojan Food Pantry provided food, non-perishable items and other necessities to students facing resource insecurity. But this year, the pantry has remained closed.
The Trojan Food Pantry operated through Student Basic Needs, a department of USC Student Equity and Inclusion Programs at Student Affairs. Located in King Hall, the food pantry was available for students to access during weekdays.
Hunter Hinson, a senator and chair of the Affordability and Basic Needs Committee in the Undergraduate Student Government, communicates the needs of students to Student Basic Needs. According to Hinson, a combination of logistical factors  caused the pantry to remain out of operation.
“There were a lot of issues logistically with the food pantry in the past,” said Hinson, a junior majoring in political science and communication. “And that’s because it’s such a difficult endeavor. Imagine providing food to a large population — it’s not very easy.”
The pandemic also contributed Trojan Food Pantry’s closure, said Sen. Nivea Krishnan, a sophomore majoring in public policy and economics, because no one was available to operate the program.
Staffing also prevented the Trojan Food Pantry from reopening. At the moment, Student Basic Needs only has two full time employees who manage all of its programs, according to Hinson and Krishnan.
“[Student Basic Needs] is in the middle of trying to grow their staff,” Krishnan said. “Once they do that, they’ll have a lot more capacity. We just feel really bad because even though we’re in student government, there’s not much we can do on the hiring front.”
The pantry’s origins date back to 2016 when Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences professor Leo Braudy and his wife Dorothy Braudy donated money to fund a pilot food pantry project on campus as a way to help students. Over the next few years, the Braudys met with various groups on campus — from the USC head chef to USG to the Provost — and the pantry expanded, eventually moving into its former location near Parkside. 
With the coronavirus shutdown, the Braudys said they wondered what happened to the food pantry.
“We hope that [the pantry] opens up and that it continues to serve that kind of function that it served before,” Leo said.
Dorothy said the food pantry is a “necessary function” on campus. 
“It’s insane not to have everyone on campus well-fed,” she said. “It’s ridiculous.”
Despite the food pantry’s closure, local resources such as CalFresh are available for USC students, Senior Director of Student Equity and Inclusion Programs Naddia Palacios wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. Palacios said renovations to King’s Hall are scheduled to be completed in 2022.
“While the physical Trojan Food Pantry has been closed since the beginning of the pandemic, Student Basic Needs is providing resources for all students in the same ways it has been since March 2020,” Palacios wrote. “For example, instead of picking up groceries at the food pantry, Student Basic Needs is providing food resources in other ways, such as referring students to community programs focused on reducing food insecurity, connecting students to any available campus options, promoting local food pantries and facilitating access to the state’s CalFresh Program.”
Hinson said he is working with USG and Student Basic Needs to provide transportation for students to food pantries, as most operate outside of the hours of USC’s free Lyft service from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
“I’ve spoken to a few senators to try and see what we can do about the Fryft situation,”  Hinson said. “[We’ll] try and establish some meetings with USC transportation or other members of the university to see if there could be some sort of setup where certain students who are food insecure or need easy transportation within the Fryft zone at other times of the day besides nighttime are able to have that.” 
While the Trojan Food Pantry’s future remains uncertain, Krishnan said USG is working on helping students with other costs including housing, textbook and technology costs.
“We’re trying to address other mutual aid projects just because we don’t want to reinvent the wheel when there’s already something out there and we’re just waiting for it to get back up and running,” Krishnan said.

We’re throwing a changeup this week and covering the NBA’s wild start. From crazy trades that won’t happen to hot takes that’ll look like Costco’s frozen goods aisle in a few months, here are 10 early season NBA takes.
Philadelphia 76ers forward Ben Simmons goes green
Boot up the trade machine because we’ve got a doozy coming up. A three-team trade starring Simmons, Sacramento Kings guard Buddy Hield and Boston Celtics forward Al Horford rocks the Eastern Conference. Simmons and forward Tristan Thompson move to the Celtics; Philly surrounds forward Joel Embiid with shooters in Hield and guard Josh Richardson and the Kings upgrade at center with Horford. Guard Isaiah Joe and guard Shake Milton move to Sacramento to make the money work, and Simmons finally has his move.
Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert wins MVP 
Traditional centers have been under attack for years in the NBA. Center Dwight Howard was driven to the brink of retirement and nobody’s heard from center Al Jefferson in years. It’s time to shock the world and let a traditional center shine. There’s no better candidate than Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert, currently averaging 14.6 points per game and 16.2 rebounds. If he can anchor the Jazz’s defense and carry them to a 65+ win season, he could finally take back a win for the big guys.
Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal heads to Texas
Everything is bigger in Texas, including the NBA trades. The Dallas Mavericks need a third star (or a second one, depending on who you ask), and after the Wizards cool down, they’ll be looking to finally move on from their 28-year old superstar. Sure, the Mavericks don’t have enough assets to get this trade done, but guard Luka Doncic deserves some help.
Denver Nuggets and Golden State Warriors Warriors face off for the Finals
The Nuggets are ready for the big stage, but the Warriors aren’t ready to play second fiddle. Nuggets center Nikola Jokic proves he’s the king of the West, and the Nuggets march on to the Finals with a 4-3 series victory.
The Chicago Bulls will sputter out
I want to believe in the 6-3 Bulls. Forward DeMar DeRozan is consistently underrated; center Nikola Vucevic keeps plugging along and guard Zach LaVine has become a top scorer. But, at the end of the day, I can’t trust a team that shoots fewer 3-pointers than any other team in the league. The NBA is more shooting-heavy than ever and a team that doesn’t shoot from beyond the arc will be exposed in the playoffs.
Melo finally plays his role 
It seems like every year we ask forward Carmelo Anthony: “Is this the year?” Melo struggled to adapt to his supporting role on the Thunder and Rockets before settling in Portland. He’ll finally lean into his bench spark part this year and give the Lakers much-needed firepower off the bench. He’s already off to a great start in the Sixth Man of the Year race, coming in 3rd on the team in total points.
CP3 is a top-3 point guard of all time
It’s time to stop disrespecting the Point God and give him his all-time credit. Guard John Stockton may have more assists and guard Steve Nash may have him beat on MVPs, but neither one dominated the game with their presence quite like guard Chris Paul has. When he is on the court, he’s a conductor, picking and choosing where each and every player goes. He hasn’t done quite enough to surpass Magic and he’ll probably never catch guard Stephen Curry, but he’s right there behind them.
The red hot Miami Heat will dominate the East
Guard Kyle Lowry looks like the Miami Heat’s pickup of the year, who currently sit second in the East at 6-2. When Lowry’s in, the Heat go into overdrive, swarming, switching and trapping on defense and doing their best track impression on offense. With top-5 offensive and defensive ratings, this is a team that’s built for greatness. They’ll finish with the best record in the league and if their offense keeps humming along, watch out.
Obligatory Evan Mobley Shoutout
It’s never too early to call Mobley the greatest center to play for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Brad Daughtery probably wouldn’t appreciate that statement, but it’s a hot take. 
Sixers trade the wrong guy
Surely the 76ers wouldn’t trade their perennial MVP candidate center Joel Embiid, right? The trade deadline rolls around with Philly hovering around the edge of the playoff window and GM Daryl Morey decides he’s had enough. The Golden State Warriors dangle four first-round picks to get talks started and forwards Draymond Green and James Wiseman seal it. The Warriors load up for a championship run and the Sixers stock up on picks to start the Process 2.0.

A  few years ago, I signed up for the social media app, NextDoor, for an inside scoop on all my neighborhood gossip back home. What can I say? I’m nosy. Recently, however, I’ve found the posts less entertaining as the site became a battleground over coronavirus safety regulations. I wanted to laugh at a few overdramatic parents, not worry about the country’s future.
Even more worrisome, anti-vaccine sentiments posted on NextDoor don’t live purely online but have very real, tangible consequences — consequences that hit a little too close to home. In September, anti-vaxxers barged into the school board meeting for my school district in San Diego and refused to leave. Police advised the school board members to evacuate, which led to the anti-vaxxers attempting to swear themselves in as the new board. Most of the intruders did not have children who attended schools in my district. 
School board meetings should focus on funding and improving educational opportunities, but anti-vaxxers transformed them into sites of political contestation, ripe with misinformation and threats. School should strengthen democracy through knowledge, not undermine it. 
Escalations in my former school district represent a widespread, dangerous problem throughout the country. Last month, the nonprofit National School Boards Association published a letter imploring the federal government for help during school board meetings. The letter asserts that school board members and teachers are threatened with violence “equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.” It details numerous instances across the country of school board members receiving hate mail and threats and encountering angry mobs that prematurely adjourned meetings.  
Although NSBA later apologized for unspecified strong language in its letter, I don’t believe they should’ve. School board members face unwarranted violence that prevents them from doing their jobs and have every right to not only seek federal assistance but also highlight the issue’s severity. 
In Ohio, for example, a school board received a letter reading, “We are coming after you … You are forcing them to wear masks — for no reason in this world other than control. And for that you will pay dearly.”  
In Michigan, an individual yelled a Nazi salute to protest mask requirements in two separate meetings. It is impermissible that scientifically proven attempts to maintain public health have led school board members to fear for their own lives.
Some Americans love to throw around the term “free speech” to dismiss any form of accountability for words. However, these threats cannot be dismissed as merely free speech when they threaten a person’s life. 
In North Carolina, the chair of a school board resigned because of death threats over his decision to vote to require masks in school.  In Arizona last month, a man brought zip ties to the principal’s office in an attempt to make a citizen’s arrest after his child was forced to quarantine. I wouldn’t call the insurrection at the Capitol “free speech,” and I wouldn’t label the displays at school board meetings as harmless expressions of rights either. These threats are not empty words.
Unsurprisingly, conservative politicians weaponized this outrage over vaccine mandates at school board meetings to further their agenda. As a result, they conflate protests against vaccine mandates with another conservative talking point: critical race theory. 
In Douglas County, Nev., Adam Laxalt, who is not a county resident but a prospective Nevada Senator, attended a school board meeting to call for critical race theory’s permanent ban. Other attendees, some of which don’t have any children in the district, cheered him on. For reference, although the uproar might make you think otherwise, critical race theory is not even taught in Douglas County public schools.
In fact, the NSBA letter explained that propaganda fuels protests against critical race theory, despite its absence from all K-12 public schools.  The chaos stems from fear-mongering among conservatives because of critical race theory’s concept: children learning a more complex, historically accurate portrayal of race relations in the United States. 
Politicians such as Adam Laxalt use school board meetings as campaign rallies, caring more about potential votes than students’ well being. Students in Douglas county schools claim the disruptions at meetings prevent the school board from dealing with urgent problems such as the lack of substitute teachers and the struggles of returning to in-person learning. 
In Virginia, riots resulted in a person’s arrest, another’s ticketing for trespassing and a third’s injury — all because the school board discussed the difference between current curricula and critical race theory. People invade school board meetings without conducting proper research beforehand. They seek to undermine an institution and a curriculum that can educate future generations on detecting and avoiding misinformation. Consequently, their actions perpetuate an ugly cycle of people who learn from a few clicks on Facebook rather than in a classroom. 
We depend on education to create an informed population that understands both the vaccines’ value and centuries-long racial inequality in this country. School boards should focus on cultivating an environment that allows this knowledge to take root. Instead, they spend their valuable time and energy worrying about their physical safety, all because politicians value their political careers more than the country’s future.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports nearly 20 million new sexually transmitted infections per year, particularly among teens and adults in their early 20s. For example, more than a million Americans have human immunodeficiency virus, unbeknownst to approximately 15% who need immediate testing. Gonorrhea has increased by 92% since 2009, while chlamydia infections experienced a 30% increase between 2015-2019.
Despite these statistics, STIs are not an alarming issue in the United States and lack public acknowledgement. The Women Health’s Policy notes only one-third of Americans are aware that STIs have become more common since 2010; barely 13% know that half of the people in the U.S. will eventually get one and about 54% know someone living with an STI. Additionally, lawmakers pass little legislation to combat the disease, resulting in large populations who receive STI diagnoses across the U.S., particularly in the Southwest. 
Moreover, those infected with STIs face significant social stigmas. When someone is diagnosed with an STI and another person finds out, they could react with prejudice because they perceive the other as “promiscuous” and “dirty.” 
Jenelle Marie, the founder of the STI Project, writes about her life as a woman living with an STI: “Diagnosed and shamed by my family doctor … I would never have a normal ‘sex life,’ a loving partner, or a healthy relationship ever again … I was cast out of the church and labeled a harlot, made to sleep separately from friends during overnight stays for fear of transmission, and called a bevy of names.” 
Those who live with HIV experience overt discrimination from society. According to a report published by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 20% of people living with HIV have been denied medical care. One out of four individuals has faced discrimination in healthcare settings. 
Because of these alarming statistics, it is vital to consider the number of people with STIs on college campuses. Twenty-five percent of all students have an STI, with human papillomavirus, chlamydia and herpes being the most common. USC must address the stigmas associated with STIs and assist its students suffering from them by offering overarching support. 
USC can start by offering support groups for those infected with STIs. For instance, peer support specialist Sean Galla of MensGroup writes how genital herpes can conjure shame and recklessness. He emphasizes that “a herpes support group is a safe space where you can share your concerns, worries and experiences to create a mutually beneficial environment for all members.” 
Additionally, a study by the National Center for Biotechnology Information discovered that support groups for people living with HIV allow disclosure and healing, decrease depression and raise self-esteem. Support groups also further augmented coping skills and improved retainment in HIV care. 
Moreover, if someone is reluctant to engage in an in-person support group, online groups are available for those concerned with their privacy. USC could offer online chatroom courses or Zoom sessions focusing on a specific STI. 
USC could also help students by promoting digital applications that detect STIs between two partners. The Safely app directly delivers STI information from health centers and doctors to the patient. Similar to how TrojanCheck operates, a person can schedule treatment and testing across almost 30,000 locations.
The Safely app also normalizes STI statuses so people can ask about their partners’ status and provide their health information to partners on an easily accessible platform.
With total out-of-pocket testing costing between $400 and $500 and the possibility of insurance companies opting out of coverage and the coronavirus pandemic overwhelming many health clinics, the Safely app can halt the spread of STIs and allow sexually active individuals to keep their partners safe from infection. 
In addition, STIs disproportionately affect people of color, who are also less likely to be connected to health treatments. African Americans diagnosed with HIV have a lower chance of receiving care, obtaining antiretroviral medicine and receiving proper infection suppression. Historically, Asians and Pacific Islanders’ mortality rate from viral Hepatitis has been very high. In 2018, out of the 1,649 Americans who died from a Hepatitis B-related death, approximately 46% were of Asian and Pacific Islander descent. 
Therefore, USC must invest in these resources to protect its student body, which comprises groups vulnerable to STIs. Ultimately, it must prevent the spread of STIs and provide the necessary services to help Trojans prosper on campus.

Snail Mail, the name of 22-year-old Lindsey Jordan’s acclaimed indie rock project, makes music that smashes your heart into thousands of tiny pieces while, simultaneously and tenderly, mending it back together. 
Jordan’s sophomore studio album, the beautifully arranged “Valentine,” sees her confidently showcase her newfound maturity in both intimate and arena-sized sounds. She reflects upon her past relationships with the grace, nuance and emotional complexity of someone several times her age in a concise, 32-minute record and finds transcendent strength in the anguish that consumes several of these tracks.
Written between 2019 and 2020 after Jordan toured her immensely successful debut studio album “Lush”— a runaway hit that established her as a voice of her generation and an innovator within the indie rock sphere — “Valentine” sees a young woman grappling with the effects of newfound fame and struggling to maintain stability in the wake of shattered love and ensuing isolation. Although heartbreak and youthful sensitivity and realization play a key role in “Valentine’s” lyrical content, much like her debut, this record sees Jordan charting new territory and touching on her time in rehab and addiction recovery.   
The wistfulness and teenage exuberance that defined parts of “Lush” are transformed into something radical and candid. Album opener, title track and lead single “Valentine” opens with Jordan asking the object of her desire: “Those parasitic cameras, don’t they stop and stare at you?” The ugly nature of love and celebrity becomes the record’s recurring motif that signifies the lived experiences of an adult Jordan navigating her early twenties. 
The album’s second single and likely its grooviest cut, “Ben Franklin,” features Jordan adopting a braggadocious indifference toward heartbreak in order to numb her hurt over one of this year’s slickest and deepest basslines. The infectious bass and synth lines here underscore Jordan’s coolheadedness, even if she admits it’s a painfully constructed facade, as she sings “All on my own, guess the shit just makes you boring / Got money, I don’t care about sex / You knew how I’d take it, you brought her to flex.”
On the same song, Jordan bares what is perhaps one of her most emotionally-wrenching confessions: “Moved on, but nothing feels true / Sometimes I hate her just for not being you / Post-rehab, I’ve been feeling so small / I miss your attention, I wish I could call.” The bitterness and torment that marks the majority of this album are best encapsulated in this verse, with Jordan attempting to reconcile her tumultuous past with what looks like an unstable future. The heart and wide-eyedness found across “Lush” is buried deep beneath complex reckonings with adulthood and crumbling relationships, enhancing Jordan’s apparent musical and lyrical ingenuity.
Perhaps what lends the most depth to “Valentine” is the many different ways Jordan translates and expresses multi-dimensional heartbreak across the 10 tracks. Whether it be turning to alcohol “just to taste her mouth” on “Headlock,” admitting to an ex-lover that “You owe me / You own me” on “Glory” or crooning over gently-plucked guitar and strings “I love you forever / But I’ve gotta grow up now / No, I can’t keep holding on to you anymore / Mia, I’m still yours” on the titular “Mia,” Jordan conveys the paradoxical nature of infatuation and its mind-boggling effects with a level of wisdom that puts her contemporaries to shame.
The push and pull of fully separating oneself from former love, the unstoppable allure of returning to it and all of its associated emotions are explored with such cutting precision that you can hear it in the ebb and flow of Jordan’s voice and tone throughout the album.
Jordan is at her most lyrically unbound and adventurous on the stunning album highlight “Light Blue,” the record’s only true love song, as well as its most liberating. Drifting over gorgeous acoustic guitar and piano keys, Jordan reaches into her upper register as she proclaims “Nothing’s gonna stop me now / Nothing’s gonna stop me now, now, now, now.” The song’s ode to “the ocean blue” evokes an exquisite portrait of Jordan standing on the bow of a sailboat raging against the wind, fully allowing herself to be embraced in the arms of rapturous love, even if it means potentially suffering in the process or in its aftermath. On top of this, it provides a wonderful segue into the following track, “Forever (Sailing),” using the motif of sailing to a similarly admirable lyrical effect.
The album shows nothing except Jordan’s complete mastery over her artistic vision and musical prowess on “Valentine.” It is easily one of this year’s most exciting albums and a deeply satisfying effort from one of indie rock’s most talented upcoming acts. Her examination of her own heartbreak and self-destructive tendencies and the proceeding road of emotional recovery illuminates her awe-inspiring maturity and growth. Jordan is way ahead of the pack and “Valentine” packs the musical punch to prove just that.

This review contains spoilers.
What could go wrong with Maleficent, Jon Snow and Astrid Leong-Teo leading a Marvel movie? The answer: everything. “Eternals,” Marvel’s latest Phase Four installment, relies on its superpowered casting and incredible director, rather than, well, the plot.
Shots of sandy beaches and gorgeous cliffs introduce audiences to Marvel’s newest superhero team. They triumphantly float down from the sky after elegantly slaying the beasts, attacking poor villagers in Mesopotamia. Audiences soon learn these are the Eternals, immortal beings sent to protect Earth from deviants (surprisingly, not scary blue-and-silver ribbon-like giants that attack humans). The Eternals are supposed to protect human development but are curiously prohibited from interfering in any wars or extraterrestrial threats, such as Marvel’s last villain Thanos.
“Eternals” alternates between clips of the superheroes building havens for humans in historical cities and them blending into everyday society during the modern age. Slowly, we meet all 10 Eternals, with Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Sprite (Lia McHugh) dominating screen time. Sersi serves as the movie’s main protagonist, and audiences are first introduced to her in present day London. There she lives alongside Sprite and dates Dane Whitman (Kit Harington).
Thereafter, we run into Ikaris, then Ajak (Salma Hayek), then Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), then Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee), then Druig (Barry Keoghan), then Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) and then, finally, Makkari (Lauren Ridloff).
Yep, it’s a lot.
We watch as they become a family, fight deviants, build societies, fall in love, break apart and come back together again. Frankly, there are too many emotions to go through in just under three hours.
“Eternals” largely failed because of its emphasis on the names attached to the film and not the film’s substance. To head the film, Marvel scooped one of the biggest names in the film industry right now, the 2021 Academy Award winner for Best Director, Chloé Zhao. While Zhao is an incredible director worthy of the acclaim, she works best on her own, where she can have complete control over the story she wants to craft, not when she is trying to add her style into the rigid confines of a well-known, well-established studio with a specific superhero formula.
Zhao’s directing style (which involves many wide angles and quiet shots), ends up emphasizing the absurdities in “Eternals” instead of hiding it. It is much easier to hide a poorly written fight scene with the style that dominated previous Marvel entries where the camera pans to alternating close-ups and ostentatious explosions that make it nearly impossible to hear the dialogue.
Surely, a wonderful part of “Eternals” is its magical cinematography. Zhao and cinematographer Ben Davis create magic on screen by shooting on-location, something common in Zhao’s films and rare in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But no amount of beautiful shots can make up for the poor dialogue and weak plot which are ultimately the downfalls of “Eternals.”
Given the packed cast of charismatic, beloved actors, the movie seemed impossible to fail. However, none of the actors are given dialogue that plays up to their respective strengths. A star can be a powerful tool for a director, but Zhao fails at balancing the star power in the movie by never giving them a chance to shine as individuals.
What good is casting Jolie if the most impact her character had on the plot is one inspirational pep talk and a kill in the final battle? And why cast Nanjiani, a hilarious comedian, and force him to solely rely on Star-Lord level humor, which is funny but also immature and egotistical? What is the point of having a powerful, diverse cast of actors if they only positively contribute to the hive-mind that is the Eternals and do not have the opportunity to flourish as individuals? 
Marvel attempts to introduce us to 10 new immortal superheroes, give them complex backgrounds and character growth and have them save the world in a two-hour and 37-minute movie. By trying to do so much, “Eternals’’ does nothing at all. Ten characters are an insane amount of faces to introduce in one film, and Zhao leaves each with a lackluster backstory or none at all. The film picks and chooses whose backstory to explore, but it expects its audience to follow along when information is introduced about a character the audience barely knows.
Honestly, who cares? By failing to flesh out each character, it becomes impossible to feel for them emotionally or sympathize with their struggles in any way.
On top of introducing 10 new characters with individual powers and backstories, the Eternals still need to fight the big bad guy of the movie, fight the minor bad guys and deal with betrayal and heartbreak. It is way too much for an introductory movie. The battle is anti climactic, confusing and asks the viewer to suspend too much of their disbelief.
Marvel has a history of asking its viewers to suspend their disbelief — we witnessed  Viking gods from outer space, KGB superhuman spies and a titan able to wipe out half the universe with a snap of his fingers —  but somehow“Eternals” is the film that manages to finally cross the line into utter ludicrousness.
“Eternals” is a disappointment. It is not worth paying money to see in the theatre, and, honestly, should be watched on someone else’s Disney+ account at home because, at least then, you aren’t wasting your money on the film.

Sometimes, I feel like a loser. I mean that in the most abstract sense, where losing isn’t about being the person who didn’t get three circles in a row but something deeper. 
To me, being a loser isn’t really about games at all. It’s about having dreams that don’t come true. At USC, it’s about not getting the grades that I’ve worked for. It’s about getting rejected by peers to hang out, even as I reassure myself that it’s nothing personal and that they’re just busy. It’s about sitting on the Center for International and Public Affairs’ stairs alone — while others are surrounded by friends — and feeling lost on campus. It’s the feeling that I’ve disappointed my parents: that I had an illusion for myself, and that reality decided it wasn’t meant to be. 
Being a loser might mean different things to different people, but in the TV series “Awkwafina is Nora from Queens,” most people consider the protagonist Nora Lin (Awkwafina) to be a loser. Nora lives at home in Queens, N.Y. with her dad and grandmother, floats aimlessly through jobs that she has no passion for and generally has no purpose in life. In every sense of the word, Nora is mediocre. 
But Nora’s cousin, Edmund (Bowen Yang) isn’t. He’s a successful Stanford graduate who’s well-versed in technology and business until season two where Edmund finds out his mother was a part of the college admissions scandal and that he never got into Stanford on his own merit. Edmund has an identity crisis and decides he wants to become an actor, specifically one in Los Angeles. Nora goes with Edmund on his trip to L.A. Yet, while Edmund quickly creates a new life for himself upon arrival, Nora does not.
In L.A., Nora ends up feeling lonely. She hangs around the hotel by herself and feels as aimless as she did in Queens. Nora FaceTimes her grandmother and her father’s girlfriend, saying that Edmund’s made “like eight friends already” and that she’s just “lone-wolfing” it in the city. Finally, Nora becomes fed up with being alone and calls Edmund, who’s at a party. Furious at not being invited, Nora tells Edmund that she doesn’t know what to do in L.A., and Edmund tells her that he thinks she should go back to Queens. 
Nora incredulously responds: “How do you know L.A. isn’t my holy land either?” 
“Because you can’t live on your own, Nora,” Edmund says. “Everyone knows that.” He goes on to say that despite Nora wanting to find meaning in her life, she never actually tries. 
I guess I just related to this part because at USC, I get the feeling that everyone knows who they are already like Edmund, who’s able to make a bunch of new friends immediately after arriving and become happy. They’re the winners of the city. In contrast, I see myself as Nora, “lone-wolfing” it around campus and around the city, traveling to Koreatown by myself and sitting alone in a food court. Like Nora, I don’t understand how you can make friends so easily or what I’m supposed to do with myself in this city. Living on my own, I feel much like Nora — directionless. 
The idea of L.A. as a place where you can find yourself is often represented in popular culture, but I think what Nora learns is that it isn’t the same for everyone. Nora’s connections to her family makes her unable to be truly independent and coming to L.A. doesn’t automatically give her direction for her life. It’s like my favorite SNL skit “Romano Tours” — Joe Romano (Adam Sandler) essentially tells the audience that, unless you change your mindset, going to a new place won’t magically make you happier. Or, as I interpret it: You’re a loser as long as you still think you are. In blunt terms, the problem isn’t the city; it’s you.
Edmund represents the illusion of L.A. and, for me, college life: the idea that you can immediately figure out who you are and where you belong. For me, Nora is the reality.
Sometimes, I feel like I only know who I am when I’m at home in the Bay Area. I ask myself if I’m really trying to find myself in L.A., and I think that I am. Yet, I also have to question whether or not it’s OK to live in reality before trying to become an illusion. Despite desperately wanting to live and love L.A. like Nora, I realize that there are some deeper issues with myself that I have to resolve first. L.A. doesn’t magically define you. You define yourself, and it doesn’t happen immediately. 
So, for me, living in L.A. necessitates redefining what it means to be a “loser” in the most abstract sense — telling myself that it’s OK if I don’t get the grade that I worked for, if someone rejects my invitation to hang out and if I eat alone on the steps of CPA. I tell myself that I don’t have to feel like a loser because L.A. isn’t a “game” where you have to win but a playing board where you can decide the direction you take. 
In this “game” I’m playing, there’s nothing to lose at all. There’s just taking a few steps forward, maybe going back to the start occasionally, but always ending up wherever you need to be.
