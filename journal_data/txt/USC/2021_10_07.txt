True or false: Mexico is among the 20 largest economies in the world. 
True or false: Mexico is a lower-middle income country.
Claudia Maldonado, a Fulbright-García Robles visiting professor from the Autonomous Metropolitan University in Mexico, posed the following questions to attendees of her webinar “Understanding and Combating Poverty in Mexico – Examining How a Rich Economy Coexists With Working-Class Poverty,” gauging their knowledge of the Latin American country’s economic rank and status.
Although Mexico appears as an image of macroeconomic success — with 13 free trade agreements spanning 50 countries, an upper-middle income status, a nominal GDP rank of 15 globally and a growing service sector  — prosperity-projecting statistics contrast the lived realities of the more than 52 million Mexicans who currently live in poverty, Moldonado said. 
“[There might be] a distorted perception of the development level in Mexico,” said Maldonado in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Mexico, strictly speaking, is not a poor country, in comparative terms. Although, if you look at social development indicators, poverty rates, malnutrition, some of these numbers are compatible with much poorer nations than Mexico.”
In the webinar hosted by the Sol Price School of Public Policy and moderated by the Price Latinx Student Association Wednesday, Maldonado spoke to an audience of over 80 attendees on Mexico’s social policy history and the inequality the country’s people continue to face. Maldonado, the founding director of the Center for Learning on Evaluation and Results Latin America and the Caribbean, served as a council member at the National Council for the evaluation of social development policy since 2020. In the webinar, Maldonado, an advocate for rights- and evidence-based social policy, dissected the social, political and economic conditions, such as the country’s profit and collusion-motivated government and a lack of effective social spending, that maintain Latin America as one of the most unequal regions in the world. 
The webinar was prefaced with a quote from German geographer Alexander von Humboldt, who, two centuries ago, wrote, “Mexico is the land of inequality. Perhaps nowhere is there one more appalling in the distribution of fortunes.” 
Maldonado said von Humboldt’s statement remains true today as Mexico continues to experience social injustice and persistent and increasing gaps between indigineous and non-indigineous citizens, rural and urban areas, genders and ages. She said this inequality hinders development and security, and acts to enable and promote political polarization and violent crime.
“It is not a coincidence that Latin America is the most unequal region in the world and is also one of the most violent regions in the world, measured by homicide rates, which is a very hard indicator of the level of violence,” Maldonado said. 
The pro-market liberal structural reforms the majority of Latin America, including Mexico, underwent since the 1980s led to Mexico growing into an open economy that seeks to profit from globalization. Despite the market growth, the process of democratization in Mexico — where the Institutional Revolutionary Party held a stronghold since the early 20th century — has not fulfilled its promises, according to Maldonado.
In theory, democratization lends itself to more “pro-poor policies” if the majority of the voter pool is low-income. However, Maldonado said a more corporatist public policy  that favors enterprises that receive their power from the government actualized in Mexico following the surge of globalization and market growth. The country’s policy system, captured by business and state elites and political brokers, functions to exchange economic benefit for political loyalty, Maldonado said. 
“Some of the expected changes in social policy, as a result of democratization, have not actually taken place,” Maldonado said. “We create an environment in which the economy is leaving a lot of people behind but also social policy is unable to smooth these shocks to the benefit of the poorest in Mexico.”
Toward the end of the webinar, Maldonado said she believes that, despite the shortcomings of past reforms, there remains a possibility to channel the movement of democratization into social policy revisions that prioritize those who need it most. 
“There are a lot of windows of opportunity, especially after democratization, to actually make social policy truthful to the constitutional mandate of social rights in Mexico and deliver for the majority of the Mexican poor,” she said.
To make use of social policy reform as a tool to lift citizens out of poverty and mend the multitude of societal gaps in present-day Mexico, Maldonado suggested utilizing policy as a platform for progressive transfers for redistribution, which can provide people a “first chance with equal opportunity.” She also said policy makers should use it to promote basic endowments such as health and education, and to help those in poverty socially and economically advance by providing a safety net of social protection against negative shocks. 
“Social policy is well targeted and genuinely progressive. It can provide public goods and services, paying special attention to those who are more vulnerable and who are more dependent on public provisions,” Maldonado said. 
As someone who comes from a Mexican, low-income background, the webinar’s moderator, MJ Lopez, found the webinar relevant and relatable to her own experience. Lopez said Maldonado’s topic is critical to public policy considerations because it emphasized using social policy to lift people out of poverty. 
“The topic was really great and [it was great] seeing … the historical context of social and economic inequality and how we can learn and try to apply it to our public policy and social policies so that we can help more people, be more equitable and to just be able to live a decent life and be able to prosper,” said Lopez, a masters of public administration candidate who serves as professional development co-chair of the Price Latinx Student Association.
The webinar was the vision of Maldonado herself, said Katie Maloney, the special events program coordinator at the Price School. 
“It was really based upon a lot of the research that she dedicated her life to conducting, and so she reached out with this idea and then, as the event manager at the Price School, I thought it’d be a fantastic opportunity to engage our student group because they don’t always get the chance,” said Maloney, who operated the behind-the-scenes of the event.
Maloney said the volume of questions from the audience, of which only a third were answered during the webinar because of time constraints, demonstrated the high level of interest in the topic Maldonado presented. 
“Dr. Maldonado was doing a really fantastic job with her presentation and making a difficult concept, which is public policy in Mexico, … very comprehensive and attainable for people to understand,” Maloney said. 
According to Maldonado, the purpose of the webinar was to share her research in a way that sparks interest in public policy, especially south of the border. She said she hopes her presentation brought attention to how economically connected the United States and Mexico are, as well as the complexity of the social policy matrix. 
“[I hope that attendees] have an understanding of how [the U.S. and Mexico’s] economic and regional interdependence suggests that we should have much more cooperation in terms of social protection,” Maldonado said. “Many of the global threats are not national or regional. They are like systemic shocks that will affect the livelihoods of people, regardless of the level of development of the country they live in.”

Michael Cava grew up sleeping under the Philippines’ flag. His parents, immigrants from the Philippines, took him to visit the country when he was eight years old. Cava did not feel like he fit in.
“I felt like an outsider,” Cava said. Everyone can tell you’re an American from a mile away.”  
Growing up, Cava had to learn how to accept his cultural heritage. For him, that meant getting a tattoo that would represent his roots. Many first-generation Americans struggle to fit in, according to The Saint Barnabas Health System in the Bronx. The Health System says that first-generation American teenagers often face issues such as culture clash and language barriers. 
To deal with these stresses and feel more connected to their cultures, some first-generation students have turned to using body art to express their cultural heritage. 
Agnes Kovesdy, a sophomore majoring in physics and computer science, knew she wanted a tattoo, and drew inspiration from her parents’ culture. Kovesdy, whose family is Hungarian, has a tattoo of a tulip on the side of her ribs. She said the beautiful natural landscapes of Hungary inspired her.
“The tulip is the national flower of Hungary, we have a lot of tulip fields and they’re very colorful,” Kovesdy said. “If you drive past you see a lot of them, it’s a very distinctive image to Hungary.” 
Kovesdy, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Hungary before she was born, grew up moving around Virginia and Tennessee, before ending up in Memphis. Regardless of her location, Kovesdy always kept in touch with her culture. Her first language was Hungarian, and summers in Hungary with her family left her with a sense of belonging in her parents’ home country. 
“When I’m visiting my family, there’s very much a feeling of ‘this is my culture, this is my heritage, my family is here,’” Kovesdy said.
When Kovesdy first came up with the idea for her tattoo, she fell in love with it. 
“I took a pen and drew a rough design where I wanted to have it. I looked at my pen version in the mirror and I was like ‘I love this. I love this,” Kovesdy said. I had the same moment when I got the actual tattoo. I looked in the mirror and I thought ‘it’s perfect.’” 
Kovesdy’s tattoo, which is usually hidden underneath her clothing, means a lot to her. 
“I don’t mind if people don’t see it. Me getting a tattoo was something that I wanted on my own body and I didn’t really care if people saw it or not,“ Kovesdy said. “It was something that I wanted them to know I have.” 
For Cava, a sophomore majoring in international relations, the path to accepting his culture was not so easy. Cava, who wants to get a tattoo of the Pilipinx tribal sun on his shoulder, didn’t like to talk about his Pilipinx heritage growing up. 
“I went to middle school in North Carolina deep in the South and we were the only Asian family there, so growing up there, and other places where there was no minority representation,” Cava said. “I just identified as Asian, I didn’t really talk about it, cause it was all just a segue to fights or getting bullied.” 
Growing up, Cava’s family moved around a lot, from San Diego to North Carolina to Chicago to Japan, because of his father who was in the Marines for 22 years. As a result, his family became very tight-knit. When he moved to California before his freshman year of high school, Cava became more in touch with his culture. He grew closer to his extended family, most of whom live in California.
 “We’ll have family parties where there’s probably 50 of us, and we’ll just talk, we hang out, we get boba, we make Pilipino food,” Cava said.
After having spent much of his younger years hiding his culture, Cava has matured into accepting his heritage as a part of his identity. 
“Now that I’m in California, and I’m older and more mature, I definitely identify as Pilipino,” Cava said. I’m proud to say it, and it’s a big part of who I am.”
Cava’s tattoo will definitely reflect his Pilipino pride. He wants the tattoo to be done by his uncle, a Pilipino tattoo artist, who Cava feels will best carry out his vision. Unlike Kovesdy, Cava wants his tattoo to be visible. 
“Being able to finally accept [my heritage] and be proud of it is definitely a coming-of-age moment,” Cava said.
Reshma Ramesh, a sophomore majoring in health and human sciences, had a similar struggle accepting her culture. 
“When you’re ashamed of your culture [growing up], you’re forced to go one of two ways,” Ramesh said. You either learn to love your culture, or you learn to hide it. And I’ve learned to love mine.” 
Growing up in Bangalore, India, Ramesh always felt connected to her culture. As a homage to her Indian upbringing, Ramesh wants a tattoo of the silhouette of India on the nape of her neck. She thinks with this tattoo, she gets the best of both worlds. 
“I feel like, at the nape of the neck, I can hide it if I want to with my hair down, but if I put it up, I know it’s there and I’m not afraid of showing it,” Ramesh said.
Ramesh, Cava, and Kovesdy’s experiences all signify the difficulties many face when trying to hold on mother culture as a first-generation American can be tough. The struggle between assimilation into American culture and preservation of heritage is often compounded by bullying or feeling isolated within their heritage. But as Cava shared, many first-generation Americans learn to love their culture and be proud of it as they grow older, oftentimes celebrating it with tattoos. And when deciding what to put on your body forever, isn’t your heritage a pretty good start?

With varying viewpoints on politics and solutions to some of America’s most pressing problems, a panel of political experts were unanimous in their agreement on one thing: The growing impact of Latinx votes.
These experts discussed the the Latinx electorate’s influence on U.S. politics and culture at a virtual event Tuesday. 
The Facebook Live discussion, hosted by the USC Latino Alumni Association and the USC Dornsife Alumni Association, featured three speakers — media strategist for various presidential campaigns Cesar Martinez, former Mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa and founder and director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy and Research Assistant at the Sol Price School of Public Policy Mindy Romero. 
The panel, moderated by Gloria Molina, a fellow at the Center for the Political Future and a former Los Angeles County supervisor, looked to spark conversation and educate listeners about how Latinx voters have changed U.S. politics and the lasting effect their vote may have on the country. 
The speakers discussed the importance of engaging Latinx voters and ensuring the Latinx community understands the voting processes and their impact. 
After being asked what he believes could further mobilize the Latinx vote, Villaraigosa said he believes educating Latino children is the best way for the Latinx community to understand the role they have in this country. For Villaraigosa, children miss out tremendously when they believe they are not a legitimate part of the evolution of the United States, and, thus, need to be made aware of their worth through education. He credits some of his success to seeing other Latino politicians prosper. 
“Some of us have been involved [in politics] since we were kids in the 1960s,” Villaraigosa said. “I’ve said at my inauguration in 2005, I stand on the shoulders of people like Maria Altorez and Richard Alatorre … We all come from the shoulders of others.”
According to the Pew Research Center, Latinos have become the second largest ethnic population in the U.S., rising rapidly over the past few decades. Despite their population increase in America, Latinx representation in the political sector has remained stagnant, Romero said.
“These issues are important for Latinos; they’re important for everybody,” Romero said. “The lack of representation, the fact that Latinos are growing in their share of the electorate but are still underrepresented.That matters not only to the Latino community in terms of voice, but also matters in terms of the strength of our overall democracy.”
Latinos tend to be somewhat divided in terms of policy and party voting, according to Martinez. Latinos make up the largest ethnic group in California, and, while the majority still tends to vote Democratic, this past presidential election revealed their shifting political views, as Trump received more Californian Latinx votes in the 2020 election than in 2016.
“I would tell Democrats not to take Latinos for granted, and I would tell Republicans ‘Stop bashing Latinos,” Martinez said. “[The Latino vote] is up for grabs and whoever is going to take more attention to us will start winning elections.”

Under the fluorescent pink tiles that lit the red carpet and its dressy audience, the room looked more like a nightclub than a theatre. 
In front of the screen stood directors John Li in his royal blue suit and Ben Ephraim in a stylish collared shirt. No longer the goofy characters that the audience would soon see, the duo were instead playing a different role. They were in their element and starting to look like real professionals.
“The Li ‘Brothers’,” which was released on Friday, Sept. 24, follows the budding friendship of random roommates, Chinese American John Li (John Li) and Pilipinx American Ben Lee (Ben Ephraim), through their shared experiences of anti-Asian racism at a predominantly white institution after being mistaken for brothers by the overly positive yet unintentionally racist resident’s assistant, Emily (Erin Lucid). 
The webseries is a sitcom set in a college dorm hall that expands on the absurdity of anti-asian microaggressions experienced by the two Asian protagonists, John Li and Ben Lee. The characters are based off of the two directors who play them, and the story closely mirrors their own personal experiences with their Asian American identity. 
“These are things that we’ve experienced as Asian Americans and things we experience as students,” Li said. 
Following the recent trend of Asian American representation in the media, “The Li ‘Brothers’” is placed within the context of films such as the media frenzy of “Crazy Rich Asians,” 2020 Best Picture winner, “Parasite,” the critically acclaimed “Minari” and the box office success of “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.” 
What sets “The Li ‘Brothers’” apart is in its commentary on the dynamic between its Pilipinx and Chinese American protagonists in a college environment. 
“We wanted to make sure it wasn’t just solely about the East Asian experience, like we often see in most Asian American media today,” Ephraim said. 
Ephraim aimed to represent his personal struggle as a biracial Pilipinx and white student that brought him “a lot of frustration and identity confusion.” 
Ephraim also wanted to highlight “how differently East Asian people and Southeast Asian people can navigate these issues and also how that can bring animosity among each other,” an issue he feels “isn’t always talked about.” 
Rather than tackle the topic of racism through a dramatic lens, the web series instead chooses to promote activism through comedy. Li often feels that racism against Asian people is ignored. 
“Sometimes, certain behaviors and actions are so absurd that they are only laughable,” Li said. “It’s important to highlight that even though it’s a ‘microaggression,’ or like subtle, it’s still there.” 
By poking fun at the absurdity of the microaggressions experienced by Asian Americans, “The Li ‘Brothers’” hopes to unearth the deeper issue of racism.
“There are lines that we write in the show that have been said and we, like you, laugh at it, but like the reason we wrote it is because someone said it before, like we want to identify how comical it can be and use that to sort of raise an awareness to it,” Li said. 
The duo first met on GroupMe, as most freshmen entering USC at the height of the coronavirus pandemic typically did. From there, they decided to become roommates at The Lorenzo where they would take their film production classes online and eventually come up with the premise for “The Li ‘Brothers’.” 
Over the course of 2020 winter break, Ephraim and Li refined their concept into a 35-page sitcom pilot, which Ephraim said was “for fun” and “had in the back of our minds” until Spring 2021 when the duo was tasked with creating a three-minute short film for their final project in a film production class. 
“We were like, we should take the same characters from that show we wrote and adapt it to like a small, like proof of concept episode, basically something that would kind of take place in the middle of the season,” Ephraim said.
Because the project took place during an online semester, Ephraim and Li were unable to outsource actors, a problem they worked around by starring in their own production. 
“I want to first clarify that Ben and I are not actors,” Li said when describing the duo’s acting debut. 
After receiving positive feedback on their final project, which is now on episode two, the duo decided to develop the story into a web series. Production was slated to begin over the summer but had to be pushed back after Li tested positive for the coronavirus. In the meantime, the directors worked with their cast to flesh out the characters by holding Zoom rehearsals. 
As Trojans returned to campus in the fall, “The Li ‘Brothers’” officially began its three-week production, a process that director Li describes as “a logistical nightmare.”
“Neither of us had ever done anything on this scale,” Li said. 
Some of the actors, such as Javi Cassanova, also never acted on camera prior to starring in “The Li ‘Brothers’.” 
“It’s definitely a big learning curve because I did not expect to be that tired after the first day of shooting,” Cassanova said.
Cassanova plays Mateo, a Mexican immigrant from Texas who’s roommates with the arrogant Lucas (Eli Staub), and is “the complete opposite” of a Jewish person, according to Lucas’ introduction to the residents of his floor in episode one. 
Some members of the production team were also new to the world of television. 
“I was a bit nervous at the start because I didn’t have too much experience with specific lighting techniques or equipment, although I knew the theory behind it,” Mark Burnam, a sophomore  majoring in film and television production, who worked behind the scenes as a gaffer and lighting technician for the production, said. 
Despite the challenges, directors Ephraim and Li wanted to cultivate a fun and collaborative work environment. 
“I think bringing talented people together and getting to work with them and taking everybody’s best ideas is like the most fun part of film,” Ephraim said, who, in addition to Li, was receptive to suggestions from both the cast and crew. 
The directors also held individual rehearsals and interviews with their cast members so that they could both be on the same page with who their characters were and what the overarching story arc of their characters would look like. “They really understood, you know, how to direct us and how to make us really bring and breathe these characters into life,” said Cassanova, after recalling a method acting phone call with Ephraim, who wanted Cassanova to have a conversation with him as the character Mateo. 
On Wednesday, Sept. 22, “The Li ‘Brothers’” premiered at The Lorenzo theatre. 
“It was really surreal,” said Li when describing what it felt like to finally showcase the end result of a project that had been almost a year in the making. 
While the cast and crew celebrated their hard work, the best part for Ephraim was hearing positive feedback from a friend of a cast member after the premiere.
“He came up to me and he was like, ‘Hey, I’m Pilipino. That was so awesome to hear you say that you were Pilipino on screen. I never see that.’ That made me so happy.” 
“My only goal is to really make something I’m proud of and that other people can be proud of,” Ephraim said. “So whatever happens beyond that is really like auxiliary.” 
The first two episodes of “The Li ‘Brothers’” are available on YouTube with new episodes coming out every Friday.

The Los Angeles City Council approved a new law Wednesday mandating people over the age of 12 to provide proof of full vaccination against the coronavirus to access a wide range of indoor venues. 
Effective Nov. 4, Los Angeles business owners must ask to see people’s digital or physical coronavirus vaccination record cards before permitting them entry. Those with medical conditions preventing them from being safely vaccinated and those with religious exemptions will instead be required to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours prior to their visit. 
Hector Aguirre, the manager of City Tacos at USC Village, said he’s unsure about what measures his business will need to take to enforce the mandate. 
“I’m not too familiar with the whole situation. I just saw [the news] right now for the first time,” Aguirre said. “I mean, I have heard that other countries like France are already in a situation where the people … have to show proof of vaccination, but for L.A., I’m not too sure how everything’s gonna turn out.” 
Aguirre said because City Tacos just moved to L.A., the mandate might make the transition more difficult. 
“I mean, we just opened last month, so we’re still brand new to the location,” Aguirre said. “We’re still trying to figure out how everything is working now, working out our kinks.” 
Marin Ruiz, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, also expressed concern for businesses, which she feels will likely struggle to implement the ordinance because of the potential loss of customers. 
“I definitely feel like there’s just so many things that can go wrong, that’s gonna be super hard to enforce,” Ruiz said. “I have a feeling that businesses are going to learn that people aren’t going to want to go there or that people might not be able to access some [businesses] because they can’t provide proof of vaccination.” 
Aayush Jonnagadla, a junior majoring in business administration, said he feels the council’s policy will have a positive impact on Los Angeles, but he expects enforcement and compliance to be difficult for students living on campus. 
“At USC, it’s going to be tough for students to be able to have all of the information about their Trojan Check and also the vaccination requirements,” Jonnagadla said. “There’s also so many different ways that you can have those vaccine cards online, so it’s complicated for people to understand … There just needs to be a standardized vaccination card that they accept digitally.”
Other students see the ordinance as a worthwhile way to combat the spread of coronavirus, such as Jake Kandell, a sophomore majoring in computer science. 
“I think it’s generally a good idea. I think the vaccine is huge. That’s what’s gonna get us out of COVID,” Kandell said. “If [the city is] able to figure out a good system to get it set up to where people are easily able to access their vaccine information and there’s people that are easily able to check it in a time-efficient manner, it’s definitely a good step and a good way to help us slow COVID.” 
Despite his concerns surrounding the logistics of implementing the mandate, Jonnagadla said he ultimately supports the decision because he feels that maximizing vaccinations will also maximize the public’s health. 
“If you do your part, you’re protecting people around you — you’re not just protecting yourself,” Jonnagadla said. “So I think that’s definitely a really important thing and I’m glad that L.A. is instituting that.”

Women’s basketball is back to practicing in preparation for the 2021-22 season under new Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb. With the season approaching, here are five of the most important players poised to make an impact this season. 
Graduate student forward Jordan Sanders
USC will welcome back 2020-2021 All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention Jordan Sanders, who averaged 11.7 points and 3.5 rebounds in 20 games last season. Sanders hit double figures in scores in 11 games which included a streak of nine consecutive games with 10 or more points. She will be one of the veteran cornerstones of the team on the low block and a likely starter. 
Junior forward Alissa Pili
Another All-Pac 12 Honorable Mention last season and the 2019 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, Pili enters her third season at USC. Even though she missed the first 10 games of last season because of injury, she still averaged 11.0 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. In Pili’s Freshman of the Year campaign, she averaged 16.3 points and 8 rebounds per game in 31 games. Pili will be a likely starter in the backcourt and has the potential to be a primary scorer for the Trojans. 
Freshman center Clarice Uche Akunwafo
The No. 2 ranked center in the country for the class of 2021, Clarice Uche Akunwafo is the most highly anticipated Trojan recruit this year. She averaged 20.1 points, 12.7 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game in her junior year at Rolling Hills Prep and shot 56% from the floor. Akunwafo was a key component in three regional title runs as well as a California state championship. While there are other veterans on the squad that will compete for minutes in the frontcourt, Akunwafo has a high ceiling and can impact the game on both sides of the ball. 
Freshman guard/forward Rayah Marshall
ESPN’s No. 27-ranked player in the 2021 class was freshman guard Rayah Marshall. A Los Angeles native, Marshall has good size at her position standing at 6’4”, creating mismatches for opposition defenses. She averaged 23.7 points per game in her senior year. Scouts have described her as having “off-the-charts potential,” and Marshall has room to grow into a long-term piece for the Trojans. 
Graduate student guard Tera Reed
Reed also enters her first season at USC as a graduate transfer from Virginia Commonwealth University. Named to the All-Atlantic 10 Third Team last season, Reed averaged 11.1 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. She was VCU’s leading scorer in her freshman and sophomore year. Reed was also an 82.8% free-throw shooter, which should help boost the team’s average of 74%. Her collegiate experience will be useful for a USC team with a mix of veteran and young talent.

It’s Week 4 of the NFL Season. In Week 3, Aaron Rodgers asked “How can you not be romantic about football?” I haven’t found an answer. So, once again, I’m writing about the bizarre, redeeming and athletically excellent moments from the NFL this week. 
Winner: Bill Belichick reminds everyone he’s immortal, too.
You know the story: For 20 years, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick were in cahoots. They haunted the NFL together and won an unprecedented six Super Bowls. All good things must come to an end, though, and their marriage ended abruptly and awkwardly last summer. Since then, the debate about who’s winning the breakup has been all Brady. That makes sense; Brady, you might have heard, is changing the definition of possible. He’s almost 45 years old but somehow remains arguably the NFL’s best player. He won the Super Bowl last year, too, proving he could win without his old head coach. Belichick, meanwhile, toiled through a losing season. 
However, there are signs that Belichick might reverse the current narrative. Yes, the Bucs emerged victorious with a close 19-17 win, but Brady failed to accumulate strong numbers, posting a meager 51.2% completion percentage, a weak 70.8 passer rating and just 269 passing yards. Belichick can take credit for that. He devised a game plan that neutralized what his opponent does best. It wasn’t enough to win the game, but Belichick gave his team a chance and showed his strategic instincts are still with him. 
Sunday gave Belichick a good reason to conclude he found Brady’s replacement. It’s too soon to make a final judgement call on rookie Mac Jones, but the early indicators are strong. Jones went toe-to-toe with his predecessor, playing better than his box score indicates — 31 of 40 for 275 passing yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Jones’ interception resulted from an unfortunate deflection, and he routinely progressed through all of his reads to find the best option. Jones’ display of mental acuity should be considered an early positive. If he continues to develop, he’ll give Belichick the most important thing in sports, a talented young quarterback, to pair with his ingenious defensive coaching.
Winner: John Ross’ revival and the New York Giants
Five years ago, John Ross blazed a 40-yard dash in 4.22 seconds. His time broke the NFL Combine record and opened doors; it propelled him up draft boards, compelling the Cincinnati Bengals to select him with the No. 9 overall pick in the 2017 draft. Since then, it’s been all downhill for Ross. He failed to record a single catch during his rookie season, struggled through numerous injuries and never managed more than a subpar 506 receiving yards in a season. 
So when Ross, now a wide receiver for the New York Giants, caught a 52-yard touchdown pass last Sunday while totaling 77 yards for the game, it prompted a universal reaction: “Wait, John Ross still plays football?” The performance also put him back in the spotlight for the first time since his stunning sprint and, with the Giants in need of help at the wide receiver position after an injury to key receiver Sterling Shepard, afforded him a chance to revive his career in a suddenly significant role. He needs to capitalize. His career depends on it. Fortunately, he’s off to a good start. 
So is his team. Sure, the Giants are 1-3, but they’re a frisky 1-3. They’ve remained competitive in every game, and their last two losses were both determined by 3 points or less. Their quarterback Daniel Jones is quietly playing well. He ranks 12th in ESPN’s QBR metric and has played better than that statistic indicates. He’s stepping up and delivering gorgeous deep balls — such as the one lofted into Ross’ outstretched arms and another 33-yard touchdown at Washington — while finding ways to extend plays in the pocket and pick up yards on the ground. He’s also avoiding the turnovers that crippled his first two years in the league and has only thrown one interception this season. If he can string together a few more games at this level and utilize Ross, both he and Ross will save their careers and maybe give the Giants something they haven’t had in forever: hope. 
Loser: The Washington Football Team
I know, I know. Everyone’s corrupt in Washington. Still, the reports trickling out of the nation’s capital this Monday were stunning; they revealed that federal law enforcement raided the Washington Football Team’s facilities. Technically, the case involves Washington’s head athletic trainer Ryan Vermillion and not the actual team. Still: WTF, WFT? I mean, how often does a major professional sports team get raided by the feds? 
The Washington Football Team should be a winner. Despite entering the season with an average, 38-year-old quarterback in Ryan Fitzpatrick and watching him crumple with injury in the season’s first game, they are a decent 2-2. They’re also easy to root for because they possess one of the league’s best stories in quarterback Taylor Heinicke, Fitzpatrick’s replacement and the catalyst for Washington’s solid start. 
Heinicke was an unranked recruit in high school. No NFL team drafted him after his college career. When he finally did get a pro gig with the Houston Texans, he was quickly released. Four more teams brought him in for a cup of coffee then shipped him out. Now, after injuries beset Washington’s 2021 quarterback room and a call from the offensive coordinator Scott Turner, Heinicke has his chance, and he’s making the most of it. He’s played real well, completing 69.5% of his passes. He’s averaging 8.1 passing yards per attempt, which means he isn’t just relying on screen passes or harmless checkdowns. He’s pushing the ball downfield and threatening defenses. A 105.9 passer rating reflects his positive play. His rise drives Washington’s case to be considered a winner.
And, yet, because they are the Washington Football Team, an organization so accustomed to losing they no longer merit an actual name, they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and found a way to become losers. Anytime you get raided by the feds, you are a loser. That’s just the rule. Moreover, their stadium covered fans in feces during Week 1 after a liquid leak sprung from part of the roof. Hey, at least the WFT are representing their home city faithfully. Even when things should go well, they find a way to cover their constituents in waste.

Women’s soccer continues its Pac-12 schedule Thursday with a home match against Colorado. The No. 11 Trojans will look to extend their winning streak to nine games, and senior forward Penelope Hocking will attempt to break USC’s career goals record.
Despite Hocking potentially etching her name in the record books, Head Coach Keidane McAlpine said the team is more focused on the match at hand than the individual accolade.
“We’re not really talking about it all that much,” said McAlpine in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Everyone is just going about their business. If it happens, it happens. She deserves it. She’s done her part. But it’s more important that we go about the business of trying to win the game.”
The career goals record Hocking will try to shatter was set by Isabelle Harvey more than 20 years ago. Harvey earned the Pac-10 Player of the Year award in 1998 and was inducted into USC’s Hall of Fame in 2015. Hocking tied Harvey’s record with her 48th career goal in Sunday’s match against Arizona.
But Hocking’s success does not mean the team is without its faults. USC struggles to start games with its foot on the gas this sesaon. The Trojans have trailed in each of their conference matches despite holding a perfect 3-0 record in conference play.
Another slow start could mean disaster against a talented Colorado team. One of the most skilled players in the Pac-12, Colorado senior midfielder Shanade Hopcroft, posted four goals and five assists this season.
The Trojans are coming off a 4-1 win over Arizona while the Buffaloes look to rebound from a 2-0 loss against Washington State. The two teams are trending in opposite directions, and Colorado will need a victory to keep its season from derailing.
Overall, the Buffaloes are 6-4-1 on the season and 1-1-1 in conference play, but Colorado’s lackluster record doesn’t tell the full story. The team’s lone tie came against California, where the Buffaloes led 2-0 in the first nine minutes and eventually gave up two second-half goals to the Golden Bears. Colorado also had a close 2-1 loss against No. 1 Florida State. 
“Colorado is really good in set pieces and really good in the air,” McAlpine said. “They’ve got a long throw, really aggressive. And they play until the end and compete.”
The key to USC’s success against Colorado will be its defense. The Trojans have allowed 10 or less shots in each of their last six games and senior goalkeeper Anna Smith has made 36 saves on the season. The combination of great shot-stopping and limiting the amount of shots opponents can put up has been one of the biggest contributors to USC’s success this season.
The team has put a heavy emphasis on building a strong defensive front to keep opposing teams at bay.
“We want to be aggressive and we want to be assertive in terms of how we force teams to play,” McAlpine said.
Although capable of putting together a complete 90-minute performance, the Trojans are looking to figure out how to start strong in Pac-12 play so far this season.
“We’re going to have to bring it and we’re going to have to stay sharp and stay focused,” McAlpine said.
The Trojans return from their away games to face the Buffaloes at 4 p.m. Thursday at Soni McAlister Field.

Let’s talk about the “c” word: chronic.
I mean, there is another c-word to describe my feelings toward having a chronic illness, but I’ll let you fill in the blank.
The other big “c” in health conversations is cancer, which can be considered a chronic condition depending on the type. But other chronic conditions, such as lupus, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, immune deficiencies, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, dysautonomia and more, hold the same weight — all deeply affect long-term quality of life. 
And just so we’re on the same page here, our pals over at the Centers for Disease Control define a chronic illness as “conditions that last one year or more and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both.”
For now, let’s talk about the word “chronic,” the word that accompanies the description of a disease but is so rarely unpacked — like ‘OK, great, I have a chronic disease, but what does that mean for the rest of my life?’
If you Google the word “chronic” and shimmy over to Mr. Merriam and Webster, you’ll get the following definitions: 
a) Continuing or occurring again and again for a long time
b) Suffering from a chronic disease
c) Always present or encountered (especially: constantly vexing, weakening or troubling)
d) Being such habitually
While all of these definitions are accurate, they give me that feeling of when insurance companiesrandomly deny you a medication you’ve been on for years: Deeply dissatisfied. If you were to show me these definitions before I was chronically ill, I’d be like: “What do those definitions tell me about what it’s actually like to have a chronic disease? What does a diagnosis of a chronic disease mean for a young person like me? Where are the juicy, real-world details?!”
So, I’d like to take this opportunity to present some more accurate (better) definitions to submit to Merriam-Webster’s 2022 dictionary: 
Dear Mr. Merriam and Webster, 
Hi. My name is Catherine and I have a cacophony of chronic health conditions and, as an expert in living with chronic illness, I must point out the serious misgivings in your definition of the word “chronic.” I am here to add to your definition because, as it stands, it is highly unsatisfactory. Here are the additions you should make:
Chronic, an adjective meaning:
a) Finding pills anywhere and everywhere — on the kitchen table, in your bed sheets, in between the couch cushions, on the floor of your car, on the ground outside your car, at friends houses, in the bottom of your purse; 
b) Procrastinating showering by lying on the floor and scrolling through dog videos while in your towel because showering is utterly exhausting;
c) Measuring your energy with spoons;
d) Always having emergency medication on hand in a cute, unassuming zipper pouch and opening it to reveal you’re carrying a whole pharmacy with you everywhere you go;
e) The magical moment of profound, unspoken connection when you meet someone who also has chronic illness;
f) Having a purse for your infusion pump that strangers compliment, thinking it’s a new and trendy side bag, while you’re in line at Dulce; 
g) Having the same pair of pants in three different sizes because you never know if your new medication’s side effects will result in weight gain or weight loss;
h) Experiencing the levitating bliss of accessing your port yourself for the first time;
i) Learning which of your friends and family are in for the long run — some who show endless compassion, and some who get compassion fatigue — and being OK with those people falling out of your life;
j) Always keeping sleeves of saltines and ginger ale within arm’s reach;
k) The absolute devastation when you put on your sterile gloves and then accidentally touch something;
l) Waking up every morning and before even opening your eyes, scanning your body to see what hurts or what’s out of place; 
m) Existing in and fighting against a constant state of anxiety that something, anything, may worsen your pain and symptoms; 
n) Navigating the everyday, three-dimensional, chess-like complexity of coordinating your own care and not being able to put it on your resume;
o) Being on a first name basis with “Dale the Pharmacist” who jumps you to the front of the line when he sees you because he knows it’s hard to stand for long periods of time;
p) Strategically positioning yourself during sex to make sure you don’t exacerbate your chronic neck pain;
q) Experiencing profound moments of humility and humanity from providers who give you their cell phone or call just to check in, nurses who gently bathe you and drop what they’re doing to come any hour of the day and friends and family who see you for your strength, personality and resiliency, but who also lift you up in daily moments of frustration or pain;
And last, but not least, the most important definition of chronic illness:
r) A state of mind of never giving up and never giving in.
Obviously, the list could go on, but I digress. Thank you for considering adding these more representative and accurate definitions of “chronic” to the dictionary. Also, please do not forget to cite me. 
Sincerely and fabulously yours, 
Chronically Catherine

Living off-campus certainly has its perks and downsides, but driving to and from school early in the morning and close to midnight, respectively, has been one of the more interesting perks. With no cars on the road and the cool air outside, I can jam to yet another TWICE song and hightail my merry way at blistering speeds. For legal reasons and the sanity of my mother, I do not speed — most of the time.
However, there’s always the offchance I have to step on the brakes, turn the music down and figure out why the person in front of me is going too damn slow. I sometimes do that thing where I swerve out a bit to see what the hold up is, or simply merge out if I’m able to. More often than not, it’s usually an older driver slowing the pace on a side street or driving below the minimum speed limit in what’s supposed to be the “fast lane” on the freeway. Whether my frequent, unfortunate run-ins with older drivers are purely by chance or reflect the realities of aging remains unknown.
In the grand scheme of things, older drivers can be a real pain in the neck. Sometimes they slow down in the middle of the street or turn without seeing oncoming traffic — they feel like a liability to other drivers. Or, at least, that’s maybe what you and I assume. 
Let me rattle your reality for a bit. Plenty of myths stain older drivers’ reputation on the road. Media portrayals certainly don’t help either. The American Society on Aging lists a handful of myths that challenge your initial perceptions, such as the promised increased safety with fewer older drivers. We’ve grown accustomed to these ageist, false stereotypes.
Families also play this ageist limbo game with their older relatives by threatening their vehicular autonomy on the basis of those very misconceptions. 
Imagine a prized possession got taken away from you — such as a permit or license — and your parents stowed it away. For young people, it removes a part of their independence; for some, their identity. A piece of plastic or paper gives you the privilege to drive a vehicle around at your leisure, at your own time and at your own risk.
However, a tiny voice in your mind always says, “I’ll get it back eventually, right? But, I’m only 18 or 19 or 20 or 21, I can go without it for the meantime.” That’s a valid response. I know my folks will do that to me once they read this article and learn I hit triple digits on the freeway to get home before midnight — again, 100% a joke, Mom. 
Let’s change the story. For the college-aged adults reading this column, fast forward into the future — 50 or 60 years, perhaps. Maybe we will have flying cars; maybe we will have gone all electric and maybe we will have finally fixed the stupid potholes in Los Angeles. Whatever the case, your family decides to confront you about your driving abilities and whether it’s safe to still have you on the road. 
That voice isn’t there anymore. There isn’t a “next time” or “getting it back.” This is the end of the road, driving-wise. The gas tank is empty. I am out of phrases describing driving metaphors. 
Nevertheless, you will have to either rely on a relative or the public transit system to get around — both of which can feel incredibly burdensome. You don’t want to feel like a weight on a relative’s shoulders and become another thing that adds onto their schedule. On the flip side, public transportation may be difficult to navigate: waiting at stops for long periods, standing on the bus if there aren’t enough seats nor polite people to give them up, or paying for various fares.
Removing an older driver’s privilege to commute on their own terms can be a truly life-changing experience. Whether you do it because you love and care for them or you hold that grudge from when they stripped you of your license, that simple act is devastating if done abruptly and without warning or prepared alternatives.
A 2016 systematic review of current literature shows that depressive symptoms doubled in drivers 55 years and older when their driving habits were stopped. The same study also found higher rates of health problems, including “hospitalizations, neurological disorders [and] visual disorders” after driving cessation.
Simply put, it’s not fair, which is an excuse we’ve all probably used a few times in our life. Instead, we must consider alternatives to immediate driving cessation that upholds an individual’s autonomy. As an Angeleno, I can be frank and say I would be incredibly worried about my parents driving around this city — a place that I believe is notorious for “offensive driving,” or pure aggression on the road. 
There isn’t a “one-size fits all” approach, making it more imperative to discuss comfort levels with older relatives. Driving culture plays key roles in that discussion, as we fully know the myths on older drivers. Many older drivers may also give up their keys on their own time, once they understand their presence on the road poses a danger to others. 
In hindsight, older drivers’ minor inconveniences pale in comparison to the trauma and backlash from stripping them of their autonomy. Perhaps one day they will have Bluetooth in self-flying cars, calling us weekly saying, “Back in my day…”

The pandemic exacerbated Los Angeles low-income residents’ socio-economic hardships while furthering financial burdens. In recognition of these obstacles, County Metropolitan Transportation made its service free because of the pandemic, which saved riders’ — many of whom are of low income — money. 
To ride Metro’s buses or trains, riders must refill their Transit Access Pass cards daily, weekly or monthly. The monthly pass cost $100, but there are special discounts available for seniors, students and persons with disabilities. Additionally, Metro offers a program called “Low Income Fare is Easy,” which reduces the cost of the monthly pass to $76 for those who meet certain household and income level thresholds. While this discount offers help to low-income riders, those $76 dollars would do more good in their wallet than on a TAP card. 
In August 2020, Metro launched a program that would allow community college students, K-12 students and low-income riders to ride for free and recently extended it until June 30, 2022. This is a good step in the right direction, but Metro should expand the program to everyone. Public transportation should be a free service because it would help relieve financial burdens of low-income communities and reduce traffic. However, for the public transportation system to truly be a good service, it must also expand. 
A Metro trip from USC to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which is only eight miles away, takes about an hour and involves taking multiple Metro lines. The further south you live from LACMA, the more lines you have to ride. It’s almost ironic that a museum with “Los Angeles County” in its name is relatively inaccessible for the residents of South Central. A trip to LACMA shouldn’t be a hassle — it should be free and convenient. 
Despite these issues, Metro also has its benefits. Peter Burns is a special education teacher at Dorsey High School. Burns uses Metro to take his students on field trips to museums, libraries and even architectural sightseeing of our very own campus. 
“We wouldn’t be able to do all of that without the trains,” Burns said. “It makes the whole city of Los Angeles available to people with disabilities.” 
Burns said that Metro can improve its service by increasing cleanliness and safety. Burns and his class are an example of Metro’s potential to make the city more accessible for millions of L.A. residents, especially those in South Central. For Burns, Metro is convenient because the Metro E Line has a stop right in front of Dorsey High School. Other areas don’t have that same accessibility. 
For Metro to be a well-rounded service, it can’t just be free. It also has to be expanded. Although Metro broadened its service, it did it in the wrong ways. 
Ridership has gone down significantly because of the pandemic, but it was already on decline in 2017, even after Metro expanded the Metro E Line to include Santa Monica in 2016. Metro doesn’t know why ridership has gone down; however, as ridership has dwindled, fares have gone up.
When the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers covered the decline of Metro ridership, they asked their readers why they didn’t use public transportation. Readers cited safety, cleanliness, timeliness and inconvenience as detractors from using public transit. Riding multiple Metro lines to get to one destination and timeliness were recurring complaints. 
Metro plans to build its new Crenshaw/LAX train line within the next year, which will make the city more accessible. However, Metro shouldn’t stop there. It needs to add more lines that allow riders reliable access to museums, work and green spaces. Along with no fees for its riders, Metro could instill an unbelievable impact.
Less cars on the road means less pollution. Less cars on the road means more people walking within their community and speaking to each other. A better Metro system means more teachers such as Burns can take their students out on trips where they can see the real world instead of reading about it in a book. It’s time for Metro to prioritize L.A. residents.
