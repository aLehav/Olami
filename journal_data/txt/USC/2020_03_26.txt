Performing on a makeshift stage in front of an audience of more than 40 people, Astrid Heger portrays a scene uncommon in plays: a medical setting reenactment. By reviving scenes of the tensions faced between doctors and patients, the play urges participants to think of outside-the-box solutions to these situations through theater. 
Through her program ACT Together, Heger, a professor of clinical pediatrics and director of the Violence Intervention Program at LAC+USC Medical Center, uses theater to teach clinical workers about empathy and responsibilities when dealing with difficult patients and medical situations. She created the program in 2017 in partnership with LAC+USC Adult Care Clinics.
“Any area where there might be conflict or disagreement is fair game for this discussion,” Heger said. “What do you do about patients who are sexually aggressive? What do you do about patients who are claiming privilege and are late for appointments and are aggressive?”
Once the actors reenact the issue, the play turns to the audience — made up mostly of clinical employees — to offer solutions, replace the characters on stage and improvise scenes. Other actors follow along with their improvised acting. 
Co-director Brent Blair, a professor of theatre practice in voice and movement, said ACT Together aims to dramatize case consultations where physicians and nurses meet to discuss issues they have faced dealing with patients.
“Typically, these case consultations are just people talking, standing up and presenting ideas,” he said. “[Josh] Banerjee thought it would be a really good idea to put some of them into a theatrical form. In that way, the complex stories are better understood, they’re more quickly accessible.”
Banerjee, co-founder of ACT Together and associate medical director for transitions of care at LAC+USC Medical Center, said the program engages employees to problem solve clinical issues, especially when working with other professionals  
“You encounter these really challenging situations … You need to navigate it together as a team as well as possible, and some of those situations can come up repeatedly,” Banerjee said. “Basically we’re looking at ways to help continue to improve the way we function as a team.
The underlying methodology of the program’s plays comes from Theatre of the Oppressed, a workshop that uses theatrical techniques to represent issues in real life and engage the audience to take actions, Blair said.
“Our job is not to is not to perform a play, our job is to invite a dialogue,” Blair said. “Our objective is not the production of art. Our objective is the production of a critical dialogue through the medium or the language of art.”
Blair described that one of the scenes of a play included a doctor discovering a female patient trapped in an abusive relationship with her husband who insists on staying in the examining room during his wife’s physical exam. 
Heger proposed a solution by positioning himself between the couple and looking directly into the wife’s eyes to silently encourage her to tell her husband to leave so that Heger could investigate the bruises on her skin.  
“Afterward people say, ‘Wow, I never would have thought that could have happened,’ or ‘I [wouldn’t] have tried that before,’ or ‘That’s a big problem in the clinic, and we’re also overwhelmed,’” Blair said. “The discussions didn’t stop in the play. They continued days and weeks afterward.”
Blair said dramatizing case consultations is important since it increases work efficiency by boosting the morale of employees and involving them in the process of team building when they are under stressful situations.
“When there’s a low morale in a workplace due to high stress or situations of difficulty in a public health facility … these stresses [lead] to a sort of a systemic breakdown in efficiency and higher than normal turnaround in the clinic,” Blair said.
Heger said she hopes ACT Together can be a standard means of education in the future, which will create lots of career opportunities for people interested in learning through acting. 
“We see it as transformative for those who participate, but also as a means toward career choices for individuals that are trained and want to get involved in this,” Heger said.

Starting out as a project for one of her Iovine and Young Academy classes, freshman Kyla Wyllie’s colorful photo collage depicting her friends around Los Angeles caught the attention of the Converse X creative team. Her project, which utilized unconventional materials such as nail polish, was Wyllie’s first step into a maintained collaboration with the brand. 
Looking for environmentally conscious creatives in the L.A. area, Converse reached out to Wyllie after seeing some of her artistic work on social media. After a series of back-and-forth Instagram direct messages, Wyllie was invited to fly out to Boston, Converse’s innovation space, alongside two other L.A.-based creatives, to collaborate with designers on “Renew,” the brand’s new sustainability campaign. 
In Boston, Wyllie said she was paired with a professional designer to create two upcycled outfits out of scrap fabric to complement a photo shoot for Converse’s new line of reconstructed shoes. She worked with her designer to decide on a material, style and blueprint for what they wanted to create. 
“The whole thing is about innovation, so it’s about taking old ideas and building upon those, making them new and disruptive and sustainable in a competitive industry,” Wyllie said. “I noticed a lot of things that connected between what Converse is implementing now into their company and what IYA was trying to teach us to implement into the different industries that we go into.” 
Wyllie said she also enjoyed being able to integrate her own style and persona into her work. Wyllie’s designs included references to the magazine she runs, “Pure Nowhere,” and to her friends at USC through screen-printed images. 
Because of the independence the artists were given with their designs, Wyllie said she was also able to admire the differing styles of the other creatives. 
“The other two people, their designs were so distinctly themselves,” Wyllie said. “We got to do whatever we wanted within the resources that they had.”
Brianna Mims, a Kaufman School of Dance alumna who was also invited to Boston for the Converse campaign, said she appreciated the versatility and uniqueness of each artists’ work. Working alongside Wyllie and the third L.A.-based artist, Mario Duvernay, Mims said she was able to witness the power and influence of art media outside her own areas of interest. 
“[Working with the other artists] was nice, especially because they come from different backgrounds in terms of what their art form is,” Mims said. “So that was really interesting and kind of what the whole collaboration with Converse is about.” 
Although fashion design isn’t exactly where Wyllie wants to head in her career, she said it’s a big interest of hers because it easily encapsulates the creativity she greatly values. 
“You get to know somebody and you see what they’re wearing and it’s a good opportunity to project your inner self to the outer world,” Wyllie said.
According to Wyllie, projecting her inner self also means practicing and upholding a value for sustainability efforts that work against fast fashion and mass production. Although it might not be exactly how she brands herself and her work, she said being environmentally conscious is always on her mind. 
“I try to bring [sustainability] into everything that I do just because I feel like it’s best to live your life consciously and know how you’re affecting others and how you’re affecting yourself in the future,” Wyllie said. 
Through her work with her magazine, Wyllie said she does her best to print her physical issues with completely recyclable paper and ink. Additionally, her own wardrobe consists predominantly of upcycled and restored clothes, which she said she prefers anyway because it allows for more personal character and creativity.
In addition to sustainability efforts, Wyllie said much of her intention in her creative process revolves around making spaces for her fellow creatives to work together and thrive. Wyllie often looks toward her friends and local peers for collaborations and support when working on her artistic productions.
Shantanu Jhaveri, a freshman in IYA and majoring in computer science, worked alongside Wyllie during one of her recent projects, an interactive art experience titled “Heaven on Earth.” Jhaveri said working with Wyllie and others on the project increased both his exposure and experience. 
“It really opened the door for us, which is really great,” Jhaveri said. “Kyla is always focused on how to help local artists or the teen gig kind of grow, which is really cool.” 
Wyllie said that with her new collaboration with Converse, she hopes to not only propose her own ideas for events and execute them but get her friends involved in similar opportunities as well.
“I think that’s the best thing about working with Kyla: She doesn’t only care about her events and her products, but she cares about the people that she’s working with,” Jhaveri said. “She makes it a fact to be a friend with all of them.”

Due to the coronavirus, small businesses across the United States have been forced to shut down and now face weeks of lost income. Many businesses are already feeling the financial strain of the shutdown, as restaurants, trade workers and creative professionals struggle to bring in customers and work. Here are some ways to ease this burden and support small businesses so they can pay their employees, make their rent and ensure that they can reopen once the pandemic subsides. 
Things to buy
Take out and delivery
Ordering delivery or curbside pickup is an easy way to help fund these restaurants while still receiving a professionally cooked meal. Local, family-owned eateries provide a variety of specialty cuisines you may not be able to make at home, which can bring a welcomed variety into your quarantine diet because, let’s face it, you can’t keep living off Top Ramen forever. 
Meal kits
Some restaurants offer meal kits you can buy at the restaurant or have delivered to cook at home. The ingredients are pre-measured and pre-chopped, and the kits include detailed instructions so you can recreate your favorite meals at home. If you are celebrating a special occasion or want some fine dining in your own home, Crossroads Kitchen on Melrose Avenue in L.A. offers take home kits of their high-end vegan cuisine perfect for a fun and healthy dinner. 
Arts and crafts
Find a new creative hobby by ordering paints, embroidery kits and more from craft and toy stores. Hobby shops may offer curbside pickup or expedited delivery, and you may discover a new interest (or a way to banish boredom). Independent art store Blue Rooster Art Supplies on Hollywood Boulevard in L.A. offers free shipping on orders over $25. If you want a product not listed on their website, they accept product inquiries over email or Instagram DMs and will create a custom order for you.
Take advantage of alternative services
Invest in close businesses
Since almost all storefronts are closed, buy gift cards for services to redeem once places open up again. Most hair salons, clothing boutiques, spas and movie theaters offer gift vouchers. Local, independent Alamo Drafthouse theater, which screens new and classic movies, is selling gift cards (and accepting donations) online as a source of income while closed. If you do this, businesses will receive money when they need it most and you’ll have something fun to look forward to post-quarantine. 
Use services adapted for online
See what professional services have moved online. Yoga studios, therapists, music lessons and art classes are just some of the services now available over Zoom or similar video services. TakeLessons.com connects you with live, online instructors to help you learn anything ranging from languages to musical instruments, computer skills to ballet. You can support instructors teaching what they love and come out of quarantine with an impressive new skill. 
Donate rather than accept a refund
If you have tickets to local theater productions or art shows, consider forgoing a refund. Instead, donate that money to the organization. While most venues are offering full refunds for canceled events, donating the money already spent on a ticket ensures that cultural centers will be able to reopen. Upon the decision to close the venue and cancel the popular show “Man of God,” the Geffen Playhouse emailed ticket holders with the offer for a full refund or an option to donate the price of their ticket to the playhouse.
Actions to take
Advocate on social media
For those active on social media, share the information of your selected small businesses on your feed. Reposting takeout menus, announcements about online sales and brands’ pleas for help is a quick and free way to promote small businesses; the exposure could be what helps them stay afloat. Local L.A. boutique Prelude & Dawn posted last week about its financial struggles following legal disputes with a prior landlord. The boutique shared a message on Instagram about the artisans that rely on regular orders, and through reposts of this statement, it received enough orders to pay employees while closed, according to a recent post on the boutique’s Instagram account.
Help non-tech savvy businesses
Offer your social media skills or graphic design expertise for free. Small businesses owned by older people, who are less tech savvy, may suffer losses because of the lack of a strong social media presence. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism students with a mastery of the Adobe Creative Suite and Viterbi School of Engineering students good at coding can help businesses build websites that make the ordering process easier. Marshall School of Business students can put their marketing skills to the test and help create a plan for more social media exposure. Donating your time and knowledge may be what helps finance their business.

Camp Jened, as one camper gleefully puts it, is a “utopia.” 
This is a camp where kids sing, play, flirt and fall in love. And, according to the Netflix documentary “Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution,” it’s maybe the one place they can be themselves. 
Camp Jened was founded in 1951 for people with disabilities. Not exactly a revolutionary concept today, but for a country pre-Americans with Disabilities Act where asylum-like institutions abound, this space means everything to its campers. It’s a relief, they say, to not be constantly surrounded by the able-bodied. 
“At camp, everybody had something going on with their body,” camp alumnus Jimmy LeBrecht said in the documentary. “It just wasn’t a big deal.”
The audience is introduced to Camp Jened through black-and-white videos dating from the early 1970s. It’s a Woodstock-like setting, full of flower crowns and rebellious young teens who we follow through to the present day. There’s Denise Jacobson, who recounted a youthful tryst that resulted in an STI. “I wasn’t going to die a virgin,” she said slyly. Then there’s Steven Hoffman, who later took to the stage as a drag queen with “Sweet Transvestite” blaring. And Judy Heumann, a counselor who spoke to the campers with distinct poise. 
There are others, too, but these are the characters who dominate the screen. They’re irresistible — spunky, perseverant and, above all, hilarious — and they make this a documentary worth watching. Although the strumming of guitars and images of sun-dappled summer camp are atmospheric, it’s really the cast of characters that are worth sticking around for. It’s difficult not to feel like you, too, are being enfolded into Camp Jened. 
“Crip Camp” is less about Camp Jened and more about the bonds campers form there. This is a place for people with disabilities to not only enjoy their childhood, but it is also a safe space for them to reconcile the experience of being differently abled in America. 
At Camp Jened, kids can sit around and talk about their lives. Mostly, it’s the usual gripes of being a teenager, like overprotective parents or relationship troubles. But there’s also the added dimension of growing up in an unaccepting environment. “A parent is afraid to show that their son is disabled, or handicapped or whatever you might call it,” remarks a camper at one of Jened’s roundtable conversations. “I think it’s much more out of fear than overprotectiveness.” 
Camp Jened is a place where these conversations are possible. And this explains why halfway through the documentary, the focus shifts away from the camp and to protests during the 1970s to pass Section 504, a law which demands that all institutions receiving public funding provide equal access. 
Taking place mostly in San Francisco and Berkeley, Calif., these protests were headed by many faces familiar from Camp Jened. In one scene, Heumann led the protesters in singing, an image reminiscent of her time at Camp Jened. Corbett O’Toole, an organizer of the 1977 sit-in at San Francisco’s Federal Building, joked “There was like the traveling Camp Jened show.”
In many ways, the documentary is an homage to the civil rights movements of the ’60s and ’70s. Classic rock anthems play over videos of children spinning in flower crowns. Photos show members of the Black Panthers dropping off meal kits to protesters. 
But though “Crip Camp” largely delves into the past, it still presents a timely conversation. This is one of the documentary’s major draws; even as it indulges in nostalgia galore, “Crip Camp” always reminds you of its relevance. The documentary shows that the struggle for equality is still far from over. The protests of the ’70s bled into the ’90s, with some thousands of people with disabilities protesting in the streets of Washington D.C. for the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. One image, of people in wheelchairs attempting to mount stairs in D.C., perhaps best embodies what it means to be disabled in America. 
“I’ll take all night if I have to!” says one child through gritted teeth as she pulls herself up the Capitol steps. 
She speaks with the determination that we first saw in Camp Jened — a determination that remains with the original campers to this day. 
When the campers return to the grounds where the camp once stood — it was shut down in 1977 due to financial difficulties — they’re thankful. 
“I almost want to get out of my wheelchair and kiss the fucking dirt,” laughs Jacobson, rolling around the dirt lot. 
But she grows solemn as she surveys the now-demolished camp. 
“Could you ever have imagined,” asks Jacobson, “where we would go?” 
“Crip Camp” is certainly a trip to the past, indulgent in the faded colors of the ‘70s and protest rock anthems. But it also heralds the changes that are yet to come in America.

A little over two weeks ago, the 24th season of “The Bachelor” came to a close in truly dramatic fashion. In a roller coaster of events and emotions, bachelor Peter Weber decided to propose to Hannah Ann, but quickly realized that he couldn’t get over his feelings for Madi. The show ended with Madi and Peter deciding to give their relationship another shot, much to the chagrin of the Weber family. 
While this season of “The Bachelor” was one of the wildest seasons ever, the ending was overshadowed by a much bigger event: the coronavirus pandemic.
“The Bachelor” and the coronavirus may have almost nothing in common, but that doesn’t mean we can’t learn something valuable from some former contestants. While some former members of “The Bachelor” understand the gravity of this situation (such as season 23 bachelor Colton Underwood, who is currently recovering from the coronavirus), former bachelorette and season 23 “Bachelor” contestant Hannah Brown is acting quite carelessly amid this pandemic, serving as a perfect example of what not to do. 
To start things off, Brown recently put up a highly controversial post on Instagram March 21 that drew backlash due to her caption which read, “What’s more contagious than a smile.” 
That was a mistake. Although she tried to defend her words by saying that she was, “Just trying to spread some love,” Brown still faced an overwhelmingly negative response to her caption. Many felt that Brown’s comment was inappropriate and insensitive toward the tens of thousands of people directly affected by the disease. 
I would have to agree with these people. There is a time and place for jokes, but in this case, it was clearly the wrong situation. When one of my friends sent me her post, I was honestly a bit taken aback. What could have been going through her mind for this to be an acceptable thing to say to her 2.8 million followers?
People are suffering as a result of the coronavirus, yet Brown somehow thought a joke was the right response. During this time, it’s important to be mindful of what others are going through every single day. For some, the pandemic has caused immeasurable pain as people have lost loved ones or have fallen ill themselves. 
In addition to her insensitive Instagram post, Brown has also drawn heat for engaging in activities that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has strongly discouraged. Instead of staying inside and practicing social distancing, Brown seems to be quite active, going to the beach and hanging out with friends. Unlike everyone else, Brown and her buddies seem to be having the time of their lives in Florida. 
“The Quarantine Crew” (this is absurdly cheesy), as Brown and her friends have dubbed themselves, seems to be quite the misnomer as their TikTok makes it look as though the group has been doing whatever it wants. Her friend group, which includes former “Bachelorette” contestant Tyler Cameron, has thrown small pool parties, inviting other friends to come hang out, have fun and enjoy the freedom that everyone else wishes they could have.
Although Brown claims that she is “not making light of the situation,” her actions prove otherwise. The CDC has discouraged people from meeting with others, but Brown and her squad have ignored this recommendation and seem to be intent on gaining more attention and popularity during this difficult time. Season 21 bachelor Nick Viall disapproved of Brown and her crew and called them out for their reckless behavior in an Instagram live stream with influencer Claudia Oshry saying, “Stay the fuck home. Stop doing TikTok videos with groups of people in the pool.” 
So what can we learn from this? 
Please don’t be like Brown and her friends. We are in the midst of a global health crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetimes; right now, safety and health should be everyone’s priority. 
Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the case for some millennials and members of Gen Z. Many college students and young adults appear to be following in the same steps as Brown and her friends by choosing to ignore the severity of this pandemic. A video from NBC Los Angeles released March 21 showed myriad people gathering with others, playing basketball and drinking games at several southern California beaches, blatantly disregarding the state’s stay-at-home order. I am still witnessing many of my own close friends continue to hang out with others and consistently leave their house on a daily basis. 
Yes, it’s true that the coronavirus poses a lower risk to young, healthy people than it does to others. However, that doesn’t mean you can do whatever you want during this crisis. The truth is by going out and hanging out with your friends, you are putting countless lives at risk. 
We have to understand that this situation is bigger than ourselves and our personal pleasure. Social distancing and self-quarantining are definitely not fun, but they are for the greater good of your community.
Please stay home and don’t be like Brown.

Although secondary to the health effects, an additional fallout of the coronavirus pandemic has been economic standstill. This has not only caused loss of jobs and business but also loss of portfolios and investments. Stock markets across the world have been shaken up and investors have lost trillions of dollars over the last few weeks, including some who have seen their IRAs and 401(k) plans severely diminished by the economic impact of the coronavirus. 
The financial instability coming from this pandemic may not worry younger people because they often are not yet in the job market or do not yet have significant savings. However, it raises a question for the United States’ youth: When a financial crisis like this affects today’s young people, will they be ready? 
The unfortunate answer is probably not. Whether caused by years of risky banking practices or a sudden pandemic, it is difficult to know when a recession will happen. Nonetheless, the recent precipitous economic downturn does bring attention to a glaring hole in our education system: the lack of basic financial knowledge and skills taught in school.
Financial literacy courses are rarely offered and certainly never required at U.S. high schools and universities. Understanding and managing finances are some of the most important things a person has to do in life, yet it is never officially taught. This is completely illogical. 
For example, some undergraduate business students may know a good amount of U.S. real estate tax code from an upper-division class they took but may have no idea how to file for a tax return. Yes, they may use their knowledge of complex tax codes at some point in their careers, but they will need to know how to file tax returns every year of their lives.
Aside from teaching long term skills such as investment strategies, filing taxes and financing mortgages, a financial literacy class could also help students learn how to manage the ever-increasing costs of going to college. 
One prevalent issue is the mounting student loan debt in the United States, which currently totals about $1.6 trillion. Forty-five percent of 18-34-year-olds in the United States have student loans, and some finish college without ever learning how to pay for them. It is quite paradoxical. A required financial management class could help students better understand student loans and create a plan to pay them back.
Students looking for forms of income to pay for college tuition and expenses could learn how to make money on the stock market through tools like index funds and options trading. Whether it is by implementing courses on managing debt or using spare time to make money, colleges and universities could play a large role in helping their students pay for their education and setting them up for a healthy financial future.
Implementing a financial literacy requirement will come at little sacrifice with much to gain. At USC, this may mean eliminating one of the general education core literacy categories and replacing it with a financial skills course. Although the general education program is important to enriching students’ studies, a financial literacy class is guaranteed to go a long way for every undergraduate.

A global pandemic has struck. 
(Wait, what? I had no idea. I know, right? Utter shock. Also nice opening sentence; can we get it in 
“Star Wars” scroll font?) It’s not like any of our lives have been entirely upended — from online classes taken at home, to a mass-hysteria-toilet-paper-buying spree that puts the most fanatical Black Friday shopping rages to shame (seriously, what is everyone using to wipe themselves these days? Any and all recommendations are welcome.)
If my international relations classes have taught me one thing — that is, besides drilling sovereignty into the deepest recesses of my brain — it is that we must define a problem appropriately before we attempt to find a solution for it. So, in that enlightened spirit of academia, let’s switch from mockery to seriousness, as we try to accomplish what might seem rather obvious but has all but escaped our leaders’ minds.
We are facing an invisible, lethal enemy that lays hidden within our body for up to 14 days. We are facing a force that might shut down the entire economy and a challenge we are vastly unprepared to deal with. The availability of medical supplies is waning, with gloves and face masks being the only protection available to our courageous medical workers who save strangers’ lives while putting their own at risk. We are facing a once-in-a-century disaster. 
The problem we face can be defined so simply. But the solution remains much more elusive, its definition still missing one of two fundamental components. The paradox lies here: Why are we seeking national solutions to a global crisis?
Yes, perhaps it rings true to the reigning sociopolitical attitudes of the past half-decade of “me before you” and “us before the other.” Under such a political climate, it is perhaps no wonder that France and Germany have blocked face mask exports even as neighboring Italy struggles to contain the virus, or that Washington D.C. and Beijing view developing a vaccine as a competition rather than the superordinate goal both nations’ citizens need equally, regardless of what pharmaceutical giant is behind its production.
After all, aren’t we seeing a microcosm of such attitudes on a local level? What about everyday American civilians’ hoarding of guns, toilet paper, antiseptics, and the protective masks that doctors desperately need?
In such times of calamity, perhaps the most chilling of all symptoms is the utter lack of solidarity we’ve seen. China has been blamed for inciting the “Chinese virus,” as President Donald Trump put it. European Union founding members have turned their backs on Italy, disregarding the common desire for compassion, cooperation and dignity, the very ideals which brought them together. Spring breakers have conglomerated in popular destinations with no regard for the unwanted visitor they might bring back that, although it might not affect their own personal health, could kill their grandparents. 
The behavior we are witnessing from thousands of self-prioritizing individuals is nothing new, nor is it anything that goes against the ultra-competitive genetic codes evolution has hammered into each and every one of us. Yes, perhaps it is instinctual for humans to prioritize self-help and primacy, to revert to in-groups and to view the other with suspicion. But it is thick-skulled and misses the bigger picture. 
Our current crisis is one that demands teamwork. We need maximized specialization and fully functioning supply chains to get anywhere near meeting the demand for medical and protective supplies. We need collective research pools where all progress on making a vaccine can be available for scientists around the world (we are not competing against Nazis to develop nuclear weapons, we are trying to save lives). We need world leaders to talk to each other instead of waving fingers (Trump and Xi Jinping haven’t spoken directly since early February). We need more intelligent contingency plans and relief aid. Even if developed countries push through the first wave of infections, what’s going to happen when developing countries with even fewer resources to defend themselves get hit or when these nations spread the virus back to the developed nations it came from? This is a cycle, and we are all interconnected.
We need people to act with consciousness, solidarity and mutual regard. World leaders must do the same.

A Marshall School of Business student has tested positive for the coronavirus, Student Health stated Thursday in an email to the Marshall community and McCarthy Honors Hall residents and staff.
According to the email, the student has recovered. The individual currently resides off campus but was last on campus March 13. 
Those who may have had contact with the infected student are encouraged to practice self-isolation if they develop symptoms characteristic of COVID-19, the email read. Students with respiratory symptoms should contact Student Health to set up a TeleHealth screening  appointment, while faculty and staff can notify their own medical providers. 
Students remaining on or around campus who need assistance relocating to begin self-isolation are asked to contact the University through the coronavirus hotline or email address. USC Housing requested Friday that all students living in campus housing who are able to return to their permanent residences do so, although nearly 1,400 residents received permission to remain on campus due to extenuating circumstances. USC Housing is currently in the process of moving students to different rooms and buildings to comply with Los Angeles County social distancing guidelines, which recommend that each student has an individual room and bathroom.
The USC community has received communication about two coronavirus cases in connection with the University: a student returning from a study abroad trip in Europe and a Keck Medicine of USC caregiver, both last week. Neither had been on campus since testing positive. Since then, cases involving students enrolled in study abroad programs in Europe and returning from personal travel to Cabo San Lucas have been confirmed by the University.
Student Health altered its coronavirus response protocol to no longer issue Universitywide notifications each time a student or faculty member tests positive for the virus. When a USC community member alerts the University of a positive test, Student Health and public health officials conduct contact tracing to determine who may have had exposure to the virus through the infected individual and notifies those groups.

Greeted by Tradición Peruana’s bottle logo featuring a young smiling girl dressed in traditional Peruvian attire, consumers are guaranteed a “traditional Peruvian spicy pepper sauce” with flavors featuring common peppers used in the country — aji amarillo and rocoto — that can be eaten with almost anything, including rice, eggs and chips.
Created by Marshall School of Business alumna Antoinette Muñoz, Tradición Peruana is an online business that sells hot sauces made exclusively in her native country of Peru and takes inspiration from the spicy foods Muñoz encountered in her childhood there, including the aji pepper.
“In Peru, you are eating [aji] because it’s part of your food,” Muñoz said. “I can remember my grandpa saying, ‘Antoinette, please I need aji, so go to the garden, cut a piece of aji and bring it for the food.’”
It was through remembering moments like this and recognizing the role of Peruvian spices in her life and the lives of the people in her community, that Muñoz conceived the idea for Tradición Peruana. 
“I knew that I wanted to do something for my community and Peru is a country that has a lot of inequality,” Muñoz said. “When we’re talking about poverty in Peru, it’s not the same as to talk [about] poverty here. In Peru, you have children dying for food, children dying frozen outside because they don’t have anything.” 
Muñoz founded Tradición Peruana in January 2018 when she realized Peru’s corrupt government did not alleviate the issues plaguing the country, such as those of farmers who require financial support and water for their crops. By establishing this business, she would be able to use its profits to give back to those in her community in ways the government could not. 
In planning Tradición Peruana, Muñoz centered her products around two of Peru’s notable sauce flavors: aji and rocoto. The aji-flavored sauce is a traditional yellow pepper sauce that can be used as a dip. The rocoto sauce is a traditional vegan red pepper sauce. 
“100 percent grown, 100 percent produced and 100 bottled in Peru,” the company’s website reads.
Muñoz divides her business operation into two parts: traveling to Peru to work with farmers on selecting the right peppers for her hot sauces and from her San Clemente home to ensure that her sauces enter retail markets. 
Her husband and cofounder Brett Addington also handles the shipping operations of the business. Together, they also use social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook and their personal blog to market their products. 
Before launching her company, Muñoz decided to attend USC to learn business skills with help of University resources, including the faculty who guided her and provided advice that helped her launch her business. Her professors and mentors served as valuable experts who helped her develop a business plan and exposed her to new experiences by teaching her about running an agriculture business.
Abby Mandell, executive director of the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab and adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at Marshall, taught Muñoz about human-centered design methodology, which focuses on addressing social issues through corporate social responsibility. As a student in Mandell’s “Social Innovation Design Lab” class, Muñoz was able to take part in a program that allows business students to visit Israel and Palestine to provide a chance to observe the multiple challenges the nations face, including racial inequality and unemployment. 
Through the visits, Mandell said Muñoz was able to learn from farmers in the region who used a certain irrigation system in their farming efforts to make better use of water. This irrigation system has also been emulated in various regions across the world with limited water resources. 
“[Muñoz] was particularly interested in the pioneering technologies around water conservation and drip irrigation that were patented in Israel, because she wanted to bring those ideas back to her venture in Peru,” Mandell said.
A portion of the company’s profits go toward helping farmers in Peru implement a drip irrigation system. With water a scarce and expensive commodity in Peru, the method creates a simple and cheap process for farmers to access water for their crops.  
“There’d be a great opportunity to use a percentage of the profits from this market to really help make an impact back in Peru toward small-scale Peruvian farmers,” Addington said.
Tradición Peruana initially faced challenges related to the export and import of the hot sauce bottles, including getting Food and Drug Administration approval. Addington said it took some time to learn the international trade process. 
“There are definitely different regulations that we had to learn about and getting FDA approval and other safety issues involved,” Addington said. “We actually learned that pretty quickly and made sure that we followed all the procedures necessary in Peru and in the United States as well … It was a challenge, but we figured it out.”
Tradición Peruana is currently only available through the company’s website. Muñoz and Addington plan to expand their business by going into different markets, such as retail stores and farmers markets, but opportunities to expand have been disrupted by the spread of the coronavirus.
“Online sales are going fine, but we had plans to get into some retail areas as well,” Addington said. “Unfortunately, right now that’s all on hold because the coronavirus [pandemic] has actually shut down a lot of business.”
Despite the shutdown of in-person businesses, consumers can still access the website to order. Muñoz plans to continue to promote Tradición Peruana after seeing a positive reception from her customer base. 
“I only need people [to] try [it] once, and I can tell you that two of [the] three that are trying our hot sauces, they love it,” Muñoz said. “They love it because the taste is different, and I am really happy about it.”

Thirteen parents in the college admissions scandal, including 10 from USC, filed a motion Wednesday requesting the court dismiss charges against them on the grounds that it misrepresented evidence used to prosecute the defendants and withheld evidence that would have benefited the defense.
In the memorandum supporting the motion, the defendants alleged that the government pushed scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer to lie under oath about whether the parents involved in his “side door” operation knew the money they paid for their children’s admissions to universities as false athletic recruits would be given to individual officials rather than used to fund university programs.
The memorandum referenced an Oct. 2 note from Singer’s iPhone released last month in which he stated that he intentionally misled parents to believe their payments would fund legitimate university activities. In the note, Singer wrote that federal prosecutors directed him to testify that the parents knew the money would be used to bribe University officials.
“They continue to ask me to tell a fib and not restate what I told my clients as to where there money was going — to the program not the coach and that it was a donation and they want it to be a payment,” the note read. 
The parents asserted that in cases of corrupted evidence, the court could throw out documents from consideration. They also cited a precedent that defendants could be acquitted if a judge found federal prosecutors guilty of gross wrongdoing in the process of gathering evidence.
“In ‘rare and extreme circumstances,’ the court may ‘dismiss criminal charges as a sanction for government misconduct,’” the memorandum stated.
The document alleged that the defendants had asked the government whether the note was investigated but that the government did not respond. The defendants stated that the government’s failure to look into potential misconduct from prosecutors proved the government has been prioritizing its case against the parents over presenting accurate information to the court for the trial.
“The Government has an affirmative duty to ensure that the evidence it relies on is accurate,” the memorandum read. “Here, that means the prosecutors should have investigated Singer’s allegations — immediately after learning about them — to ensure the evidence generated by his calls was accurate and untainted by coercion.”
The memorandum also stated that the delayed release of evidence relevant to the parents’ defense further strengthened their case for dismissing the charges. The original deadline to release information was May 30, 2019, and the federal government turned over Singer’s iPhone note Feb. 26.
In the court documents, the defendants asked that recordings of phone conversations between Singer and the parents not be used in court if the charges are not dismissed and the trials proceed. They argued the evidence is unusable because of the government’s misconduct in obtaining the recordings and its failure to turn over relevant evidence to the defense in a timely manner.
Eleven of the 15 parents who pleaded not guilty and will stand trial beginning this fall have ties to USC. Trials for the first group of parents who opted to contest charges are set to commence Oct. 5, with jury selection beginning Sept. 28. The coronavirus outbreak will not affect trial dates, federal judge Nathaniel Gorton stated in an order filed last week.

New security protocols have been implemented for Zoom online classes, Chief Information Officer Douglas Shook announced to faculty and students Wednesday. The new policies come after two lectures in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences were interrupted by unknown participants using derogatory and racist language. 
“We are deeply saddened that our students and faculty have had to witness such despicable acts,” President Carol Folt and Provost Charles Zukoski wrote Tuesday in a schoolwide email. “When students and faculty gather, there is a trust that it is a safe environment. This trust has been breached by people intentionally trying to cause great harm at a time when our entire community is trying to cope with a global health crisis.”
Simone Brown, a freshman majoring in communication, experienced one of these disruptions in her “Communication and Social Science” class and said that her lecture began normally as clinical associate professor of Communication Jillian Pierson asking students about their well-being. While Pierson was speaking, an unknown voice kept aggressively telling her to hurry up. 
Although Brown considered the remarks to be disrespectful at the time, she didn’t think anything of it. However, as the lecture progressed, the situation escalated. 
“I thought that was just kind of rude, but I didn’t think it was anything unusual — I thought there was maybe someone in the class who thought it was a joke or something,” Brown said. “When she shared her slides on the screen to show us her notes, that’s when people started drawing on the screen. The first one they drew genitalia and then … wrote the n-word.”
As Pierson attempted to continue the class by erasing the offensive images and removing the perpetrator from the Zoom session, the person continued to jump back into the lecture. As this occurred,students furiously texted in the chat to help Pierson identify the hacker in her more than 100-person class. The classroom was no longer able to progress normally.
After multiple disruptions, Pierson decided to end the lecture 30 minutes early. 
“[Pierson] said, ‘I’m really sorry guys, I’m so sorry this is happening. I’m going to end the class now. Look out for a [lecture recording] on Blackboard,’” Brown said. “And then you could hear the person who was speaking the whole time go, ‘Yeah, you end the class, end the class.’”
Once the class ended, Brown said she felt shaken up by the experience. 
“I live in California, so my entire state is on lockdown so it’s been a bit weird, and I was hoping to get back into more of a regular routine with classes restarting, but [the disruption] was definitely pretty jarring,” she said.
To prevent future incidents, Shook announced that Information Technology Services has enabled the waiting room feature for all USC Zoom classes and meetings. 
With the new feature, professors and meeting hosts will be able to determine who to admit to each virtual session. If a disruption occurs, faculty are advised to remove the participant from the class and use the “lock” feature to block any additional people from entering the lecture.
Brown, who had her first Zoom class with the new protocol Wednesday, said she believes the University is making the right decision to implement increased security measures. However, professors who are currently struggling with the technological switch to virtual instruction may face additional issues with the new features. 
“I definitely have a few [professors] who … might forget to admit students and have people just waiting in the waiting room,” Brown said. “I feel it’s worse [not to] explore these extra security options, [than to] make sure that doesn’t happen in the future.”
According to the Los Angeles Times, school districts including the Conejo Valley Unified School District have also experienced incessant ‘Zoom-bombing’ by unknown users who disrupt online sessions with racial slurs and pornography. Universities like UC Berkeley have also advised faculty and students on new safety protocols to prevent similar incidents from happening.
According to the email sent by Folt and Zukoski, the University will remain on alert to prevent classroom interruptions from reoccurring.
“We will be vigilant in determining who was responsible for these actions, and we are doing everything in our power to stop it right away,” the email read.

With events canceled and venues closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, “Live! From Somewhere” is the Thornton School of Music’s approach to sharing student talent and maintaining a sense of community without being physically on campus together.
On March 16, the school launched “Live! From Somewhere,” an online series of student and alumni performances, to share music amid social distancing. Currently available on Thornton’s YouTube channel are five videos showcasing the wide variety of artists within the school.
Nolan Juaire, a sophomore majoring in classical guitar performance, is the first musician featured in the series.
Juaire, who works in a Thornton office, was approached by his boss with an offer to perform in a video series that was then a secret. He didn’t know what to perform, but since he enjoys performing and takes any opportunity as he can, he said yes. 
In his video, Juaire played “A Felicidade” by Antônio Carlos Jobim. Being a solo guitarist, he is not reliant on other musical accompaniments and is able to practice and perform outside of a classroom setting. 
“It’s a Brazilian jazz piece written by Antônio Carlos Jobim, and I chose it because of its nature — it’s a very upbeat kind of piece,” Juaire said. “Really [‘Felicidade’] means happiness. So I’ve been playing this piece for a couple of years now, and it’s been a staple whenever I’m feeling down. It’s a nice piece to lift me up.”
While these videos can’t compete with the live performances originally scheduled for the Spring semester, he believes they are still important. 
“This feels like a way to light up the spirits of both the students and the community through saying we can make music from anywhere, and we have,” Juaire said. 
William Kanengiser, an associate professor of practice for classical guitar who teaches Juaire,  is a fan of Juaire’s song choice and the overall series.
“I was so thrilled to see him take the initiative to do that, and it was a delight for me,” Kanengiser said. “I thought he did a beautiful job playing that piece, which incidentally is called ‘Felicidade,’ and it means happiness, which is something that we need to cultivate right now.” 
While Kanengiser admits that classical guitar is easy to practice alone, he agrees that the community aspect of the series is vital.
“I think that anything we can do to show the world that we’re still making music, we’re still practicing and we’re still finding joy in the comfort of music being shared [is important],” Kanengiser said. “Anything we can do to project that is a positive thing in these surreal times.”
Charlie McCollum, a freshman majoring in cinematic arts, film and TV production, discovered the series through the Thornton Instagram page and finds the videos entertaining as well as inspirational.
“I love how they are lighthearted about it,” McCollum said about the approach to social distancing.  “The one I saw was a cello performance and instead of using his fingers [to hold down the strings] he was using a roll of toilet paper and I think that lighthearted fun, even though we are in the midst of a crisis, does help people remain more optimistic during a dark time.”
For McCollum, “Live! From Everywhere” also reminded him of the sense of community present at USC and in Thorton. 
“Watching those performances really made me aware of the community I found at USC and how much I want to be a part of it and also reinforces an idea of family that comes from being at such a great school with talented individuals,” he said.
With Trojans scattered across the globe, the series unites students regardless of their location or time zone. Amelia Horney, a freshman majoring in composition, said she believes the series is accomplishing its mission of bringing artists together during this isolated time. 
“I think it’s a wonderful way for us to stay connected,” Horney said. “It’s really comforting to be able to still have performances and still get together as musicians or people who love music.”
Horney discussed the series with a composition instructor outside of USC, Saad Haddad, a Thornton alumnus. He told her that he was not surprised at the initiative to launch an online series, as that community spirit was present while he was a student years ago.
“The great thing about Thornton is it really embodies Trojan Family,” Horney said. “It’s always been a community and it wasn’t something that was forced. I think it’s really important that we all find ways to stay unified.”
You can watch Juaire’s performance and the rest of the series on the USC Thornton School of Music YouTube page. Thornton students, alumni and faculty are invited to submit their own performance videos through the school’s official website.

Filled with excitement and suspense, Hulu’s new original series “Little Fires Everywhere” has already grasped viewers through only four episodes. The miniseries premiered exclusively on the streaming platform March 18, featuring heavy-hitting actresses Kerry Washington and Reese Witherspoon. The two also executively produce the series, which is based on the novel of the same name written by Celeste Ng. 
The miniseries takes place in a wealthy Ohio suburb outside Cleveland during the 1990s. Witherspoon’s character, Elena Richardson, is an outspoken journalist living with her husband and four teenage children, all of whom are incredibly complex, adding dimension to an ever-evolving plot. 
Mia Warren (Washington) is an artist and single mother who has recently moved to the town with her teenage daughter, Pearl (Lexi Underwood). When Warren and Richardson first meet, audiences can immediately sense the tension between them due to the difference in their socioeconomic backgrounds. 
The success of the early episodes lies within the contrast between Warren and Richardson’s differing parenting methods and lifestyles. As Pearl grows closer to the Richardson children, Warren becomes weary of who her daughter is becoming. By contrast, Richardson’s youngest daughter, Izzy (Megan Stott), is the black sheep of the family and is constantly at odds with her mother. 
Both Izzy and Pearl fight against the mold in which their mothers attempt to enclose them and end up finding solace in one another’s mothers. Through the stories of their daughters, the series accentuates how different the two women are and effectively creates drama with their clashing values. 
Although the overzealous family conflicts are hard to ignore, it’s the show’s display of Richardson’s crashing world that captivates the audience. In the opening credits of each episode, items that represent her perfectly curated life are shown burning in flames. Varsity jackets, family portraits, an activities schedule and a crystal glass are all on fire, symbolizing the demise of her picturesque family. 
The show is not only well-written, but Washington and Witherspoon’s acting is also phenomenal. Witherspoon does not disappoint in convincing the audience that Elena is truly living her worst nightmare. Washington adds just as much value to the show by clearly portraying Mia as a head-strong mother with a complicated past. In just the four episodes that have aired, the two perfectly articulate their characters’ stubbornness while connecting with the audience through each of their character’s demise.
Even the actors that play the children are clearly invested in portraying each character to their fullest potential, making the story that much more real. While the show contains popular tropes like annoying brothers and an all-too-perfect sister, “Little Fires Everywhere” is far from a corny family drama; the show perfectly demonstrates the full range of human emotion that comes with growing pains, teenage angst and troublesome relationships. 
With the first half of the miniseries already out, the show gets a 4 out of 5, based on the acting, cast and plot. The acting and cast are brilliant, and while the plot is amazing, it is too soon to tell how it all unfolds. Given that there is so much more in the story to come, viewers can probably expect more dramatic scenes ahead. However, not knowing who truly started the fire, how Richardson and Warren’s relationship ends nor how the individual storylines of each child will unfold adds to viewers’ excitement, keeping them engaged. Seeing as there are only four episodes left, the audience can only hope that the ones coming up will only top the delivery of the previous spectacle of events and sew the storyline together. 
New episodes of the series air Wednesdays on Hulu for the next four weeks until the end of the season.

College is a microcosm of the real world. While students are taking exams and accumulating knowledge about their respective fields of study, they are also doing just as much learning outside the classroom. From adapting to living with roommates to dealing with the stress of midterm season, college campuses are a crossroads where students acquire the skills needed to survive and succeed on their own in the real world. 
USC’s dwindling acceptance rate has created a hypercompetitive academic atmosphere in which self-motivated students often feel pitted against each other for grades, spots in clubs and student organizations and coveted internships and research positions. Rejection is inevitable, and the one-sided projections of others’ lives via social media apps often add to the pressure and anxiety of the competitive climate, leaving students feeling like they should constantly be doing more to keep up. Not to mention, students are responsible for paying up to $77,000 a year for tuition, room and board — only heightening the pressure students feel to constantly be at their best, accumulating awards and extracurricular activities to “justify” their pricey ticket of admission or give them the best chance at earning scholarships.  
The pressure to be perfect on an elite college campus translates into increased stress levels and declining mental health. The words “impostor syndrome” are often brought up jokingly in conversation, but it’s something that’s felt by more students than who care to admit it. Many students have been perfectionists their entire lives, and from early on, college is a constant stream of adversity and adaptation.
Marshall School of Business professors constantly reiterate that failure is an essential part of the entrepreneurial model. Understanding that failing is a crucial part of the ideation process helps creatives and entrepreneurs embrace their failure; internalizing lessons and constructive criticism that will help them shape their next iteration or attempt. The concept of “failing fast” allows innovators to rapidly cycle through several ideas with little regard for the ones that didn’t work, facilitating experimentation, creativity and ultimately, progress. 
Academic professionals are attempting to introduce this mindset of positive and neutral failures beyond business classes at colleges around the country, creating programs and campaigns that normalize failure. Smith College has created a “Failing Well” initiative, opening up a discourse on failure by offering workshops about impostor syndrome, perfectionism and academic achievement as a whole. Similarly, the Stanford Resilience Project attempts to “normalize setbacks and help students reflect on and learn from their failures” through dorm programming, student panels, workshops and campus-wide performance events all about the importance of acknowledging failure and learning how to move forward. 
This is perhaps easier said than done. Students should be kinder to themselves — encountering failure is inevitable, but they have complete control over the mindset they choose to approach it with. Constant comparison with others in classes or online does nothing to boost self-esteem or self-confidence. At the end of the day, all one can do is be the best version of themselves that one can be, regardless of the grade one ends up with or the accolades one receives.
A bad midterm grade, botched internship interview, club rejection or failed relationship is ultimately not the end of the world; life itself is a constantly-evolving opportunity for self-growth and exploration. Getting rejected once doesn’t necessarily mean students should quit entirely and refocus their attention. It’s simply a numbers game — the more times that students put themselves in unfamiliar and uncomfortable situations and experience rejection, the more unfazed they will be.  As Smith College’s leadership development specialist Rachel Simmons notes, “failure is not a bug of learning, it’s the feature.”
USC is home to students and professors who have amassed astounding academic achievements, created groundbreaking inventions and are leaders in their field. Surrounded by such extraordinary ambition, it can be easy to feel intimidated and underachieving, but students should take inspiration from the opportunities and people around them. None of these accomplishments could have come without many stumbling blocks, rejections, trial and error and most importantly, persistence. 
Especially in college, when things are always changing so quickly, there should be no shame in not constantly performing your best. USC cultivates a competitive academic culture, but that’s only one side of the story  — learning how to fall, and more importantly, pick yourself back up, is a skill that’s essential to all parts of life. Accepting failure doesn’t mean you’ve admitted defeat — it means you’ve put yourself out of your comfort zone and learned something new. Students need to alter their mindset. Failing is an unavoidable yet essential part of both their curriculum as college students and as humans.

Have you ever met a climate denier? 
I don’t mean gawking over President Donald Trump’s audacious comments on live TV or avoiding eye-contact with some conspiracy theorist on the side of the street — I mean in the flesh. Well, fortunately for you, I have some of my own encounters that come to mind. 
The first is from my seventh grade life science class. I remember it vividly: My classmate was called out for not believing in global warming. Her rebuttal? “I don’t know, it’s not like you call the world getting colder … global cooling.” Neither teacher, nor my smart-aleck self, had anything to say. 
Another example is from high school. I expressed my opinion on climate science with a friend, believing we shared the same opinion until she interrupted me mid-roast.
“I just think that whatever happens is meant to happen.” 
This stance encapsulates a common trend today — the rejection of reputable scientific evidence for an outlook that relies on destiny instead. This outlook labels climate science as a form of hysteria, instead referring to climate activism as “climate alarmism.” It rivals the voice of Swedish environmental activist phenomenon Greta Thunberg. And, it happens to take the form of another European teenage girl. 
Naomi Seibt — referred to as the  “anti-Greta,” — is paid and promoted by the Heartland Institute, an American conservative think tank. She questions the scientific consensus that human activity and greenhouse gas emissions are causing climate change. Instead, the German poster child argues that climate activists are unnecessarily panicking, despite countless scientific reports that greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of warming since the mid-1900s. 
As a piece of conservative propaganda, the anti-Greta can also be considered a pawn for monetary gain — the Heartland Institute is closely allied with the Trump administration, which has repeatedly denied climate change reports while pursuing a pro-fossil fuels agenda. By dichotomizing climate activism and climate “realism,” Seibt’s platform highlights an issue beyond fiscally driven political agendas, revealing lackadaisical approaches to critical issues. The magnitude of urgency in responding to conflict — whether it be climate change or perhaps the coronavirus — depends on mania, privilege and how political motives continually compromise the divide between state and religion. Frankly, “climate alarmism” as a concept is alarming. 
In the case of the rift between climate activism and climate “realism,” one side substantiates itself on accredited scientific evidence while the other believes in a predestined course of events. This aspect bolsters “God’s will” as a mechanism for being skeptical and equating any contradictory opinion to hysteria— what will happen is meant to happen. 
At the end of the day though, this mindset transforms an ostensible bipartisan issue to one that just attempts to expose the other side as frantic. We see this through climate change, when skeptics parade climate activism as “alarmism,” but also through the coronavirus. Despite health promotion experts’ advice to stunt the spread of the virus, deniers are weaponizing “hysteria” to undermine the pandemic — just look at the college students partying in Miami right now.
Moreover, climate “realism” submits to a hands-off approach in light of this worldwide crisis. For example, a denier who has the means to invest in fossil fuels, benefits from calling climate change “fake news,” disregarding science and the bulk of humanity. To reiterate a privileged mindset: It may not directly affect them, so it just does not bother them.  
This is a kind of ignorance embedded in conceit; after all, climate change disproportionately affects lower socioeconomic groups. Although this issue caused by human activity has the potential to be humanity’s downfall, it most strongly impacts the most vulnerable. Sound familiar? 
While the anti-Greta epitomizes fallacies of climate science dissent, idolizing the real Greta means more than accepting scientific fact. It involves waking up to a reality where urgency is masked as mania to protect religious freedom, yet secularism allows religious freedom.  By understanding these reasons beyond science skepticism, we can only attempt to catalyze others’ transitions from climate skepticism to climate activism. 
As alarming as other perspectives can be sometimes, we must take the time to dissect them before hysterics can be used as a counterargument. Ultimately, we should engage with people like that girl in my seventh-grade life science class. We should attempt to understand my high school friend’s train of thought. We should decipher the significance of the anti-Greta. Perhaps now is the time to remain calm and just listen — then act.
