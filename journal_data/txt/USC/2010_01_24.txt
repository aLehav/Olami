People sometimes place artists on pedestals, idolizing creative types as if they don’t have to contend with the same problems that others encounter in their day-to-day life. The social expectation that accompanies being an artist — or, in this case, a touring musician — curiously dismisses the fact that most musicians are regular people who just happen to be particularly handy with a microphone or an instrument.
Hang me up · Cold War Kids, including bassist Matt Maust (above), played its first show of 2010 on Friday. The band is touring to promote its new EP. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
On Friday night, those in attendance at the Wiltern had the pleasure of seeing two regular guys share a stage, trying to entertain a large crowd while remaining as human as possible.
Alec Ounsworth, formerly of the indie-rock group Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, was the first to try his hand at the feat.
Ounsworth is touring with the Cold War Kids in support of his new album Mo Beauty. It was easy to see that Ounsworth wasn’t there exclusively to sell a product or even to promote himself but was rather enthusiastic about supporting his friends in Cold War Kids. He obviously wasn’t added to the bill to sell those last hundred tickets; in all likelihood, Cold War Kids selected him as the opening act because he knew how to entertain, and the band probably didn’t mind hanging out with him.
Ounsworth knew that the night was about another band, but he still gave his all in the performance. His set featured songs from Clap Your Hands And Say Yeah, Flashy Python and, of course, some of his own compositions. His glittery indie pop entertained for a while but lost momentum near the end, drawing the most attention from the young crowd but losing them as their attention span petered out.
Ounsworth’s opening performance set the table for what was ultimately an epic performance by Cold War Kids. The intermission was lengthy, but the screen Live Nation set above the stage provided some entertainment for everyone as concertgoers were able to text in whatever they wanted others to see.
Cold War Kids hit the stage around 10 p.m. Expectations for the performance were high, evidenced by an audience that was already screaming at the beginning of the group’s set. After a hiccup at the start due to some technical problems with a guitar, the band finally got going with “I’ve Seen Enough,” immediately spurring the audience into singing along.
After the first three songs, Cold War Kids moved into “Welcome To The Occupation,” where they proved that their maturity and comfort onstage is at a career high. The group’s previous tour and a couple of gigs at random places — our own McCarthy Quad included — really helped its members turn their small band into an outfit that now passes as a Southern California classic.
Every day these average Joes from Long Beach, Calif. begin to look more and more like a band that Californians can start to idolize.
With their new EP Behave Yourself, Cold War Kids take a step forward in their careers. With the preponderance of sad stories and simple yet extremely effective songwriting, the new EP takes the rockers back to the basics that made them what they are now. The sound in Behave Yourself is pointedly unlike the darkness and experimentalism of Loyalty to Loyalty. The band is poised to take the obvious next step and record a new LP next month with big producer Jacquire King. King was the creative force responsible for ripping Kings of Leon away from the band’s true fans and turning them into international superstars with Only By The Night.
Friday night’s show at the Wiltern was huge for both the band and audience alike, and it felt like homecoming for a football team who had just won the title at an away game.
It’s possible that Cold War Kids will soon be to Southern California what Spoon is to Austin or what the Strokes were to New York City. These alternative music legends at some point all broke out of their local markets but still prefer to carry the title of hometown sweethearts than guitar legends when they are back home.
To close out the night, front man Nathan Willett dedicated “We Used To Vacation,” a crowd favorite, to the victims of the earthquake in Haiti.
“A lot of these songs contain metaphors for natural disasters, things that are the worst case scenario when people are the most dependent or most needful, and this song is about that,” Willett said. “During this song we ask that you put your thoughts and your energy towards the people in Haiti.”
Cold War Kids dedicated the end of their epic homecoming concert to a noble cause, like true hometown heroes and not just rock idols.

Despite the uncharacteristically wet weather and the cancellation of the second evening of Welcome Back Nights, the Interfraternity Council gave out a record number of bids this spring.
The recruitment period began on Monday, Jan. 18, and bids were given out Saturday. Though spring recruitment typically yields less new members than fall recruitment, 293 bids were given this spring, up from 290 last spring, according to Parker Adams, IFC’s vice president for external relations.
“I’m really excited with how recruitment went this week,” said Eric Ronan, president of IFC. “All the fraternities did a great job of obeying the rules of recruitment and moratorium.”
Though last week was plagued by rain and cold weather, Ronan said he does not think this affected the recruitment numbers.
“Rain might have made it difficult for fraternities who were planning events outside, but I don’t think rain’s going to stop anybody from going Greek,” he said.
Nick Stubberfield, president of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, said though the rain did not deter those intent on joining a fraternity, it may have kept away people who were unsure whether or not the wanted to go Greek.
“It cut down on guys that might have been in-between, but it didn’t stop guys that were definitely going to rush,” he said.
Marcello Dubaz, president of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, echoed Stubberfield’s sentiment.
“The rain could have affected it, especially early on,” he said. “People who would have come … they may not have come out.”
Recruitment numbers might also have been impacted by the cancellation of the second of two Welcome Back Nights, though Ronan said this effect was likely negligible.
“It would not necessarily have had an effect,” he said. “Welcome Back Nights is just supposed to be an event for everybody to have a good time and fraternities to celebrate the beginning of the semester with their fellow brothers.”
Still, Ryan Blakemore, president of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, said he thought it could have made a difference in people’s decision to participate in recruitment.
“I do think it hurt their [the non-Greeks] view on the Greek system,” he said.
Greg Turk, president of Kappa Sigma fraternity, said the cancellation might have had a slight impact, but nothing noticeable.
Even with these two obstacles, IFC offered three more bids than last spring and 48 more bids than spring 2008. This trend, Ronan said, is the result of an improved recruiting process.
“The fraternities do a better and better job each year of recruiting,” Ronan said. “After every year, I think they really learn from the whole process and have just done a great job marketing and selling themselves to potential rushees.”
The number of bids offered could still increase, as the fraternities will hold a secondary rush on Jan. 27 at The Lab Gastropub.
The secondary rush period, Ronan said, is a chance for potential members who were not offered a bid to the house they wanted, or not offered a bid at all, to explore the other options and potentially get a bid to a different chapter. This is the second semester that IFC will hold a secondary recruitment period.
“It’s a great opportunity for the fraternities to increase their numbers and get guys who they didn’t necessarily get to meet,” Ronan said. “If we can increase our [recruitment numbers] by even one, that would be great.”

Southern California has always been a hotbed of musical talent, spawning bands that have reached spectacular heights of success. So it’s no surprise that, as usual, the local music scene is flourishing — brimming with fresh sounds and genre-bending fusions.
Ground Zero’s Welcome Back concert, held on a damp and chilly Friday evening, showcased four local bands, all with their own special formula.  Hearing the music and watching the silhouettes of the crowd bouncing along in shadowed elation, it was clear that Southern California is still a prime area for young talent.
The night started with a local funk band, Down to Funk, who brought an explosive start to the show.  If the name didn’t give it away, the first tune did — unmistakable old-school funk at its core, with a splash of jazz influence noted during the plentiful instrumental breaks and solos.
Some songs flowed with a subtle, more low-key funk while other songs hit with a venerable freight train of groove. With Bernard Hermann-like horn arrangements blending with guitar, bass and keys to form a frantic wall of sound, the music conjured up images of Ocean’s 11’s casino-heist sequences.   Most impressively, though, was that it seemed everyone on stage wielded their instruments with the confidence that comes from having sheer technical ability, including their lead singer who brimmed with stage presence.
Derik Nelson Band hit the stage next, fading the prior funkiness away into a mellower, pop-based sound that was perfectly at home in Ground Zero’s coffeehouse-setting. If Down to Funk’s music hit the audience like a train, Derik Nelson Band’s sound was more of an oceanic undertow, slowly pulling bystanders into a sea of bobbing heads.
The music itself seemed closest to John Mayer’s recent work, though not as blues-based.  The set ranged from chilled-out ballads to more upbeat tunes shimmering with sped-up tension, but the theme throughout the set stayed the same: a blend of alternative pop and jazz influences.
Interesting breaks in rhythm and deft uses of contrasting modalities helped the music not become an indie-rock cliché.  It was hard not to be fooled by the jazz-pop sound, but you knew there was some serious talent when the guitarist ripped into a searing lick or the keyboardist flew into a head-foggingly quick jazz line.  It just so happens that the band can write melodies with a strong pop sensibility; although at times the performance sagged with predictable, slowed-down crooning, the instrumental breaks helped breathe renewed life into the set.
Tommy King — the eponymous group for lead singer/keyboardist Tommy King — performed next, bringing a slight shift from the jazz-tinged sets of the prior two groups.  Here, a more baroque-pop sound was featured, a self-proclaimed blend of soul, rock and “Italian pop.”  Baroque pop is noted for the classical influences in its arrangements, and many of Tommy King’s songs had this, such as the song “Get What You Deserve,” which had a seductive, almost gothic edge to the sound.
King himself, strangely enough, channeled some inner Smashing Pumpkins, vocally sounding quite similar to Billy Corgan in the best way possible.  The band’s set helped invigorate the audience after Derik Nelson Band’s brand of smooth jazz pop. Tommy King’s songs had a buttons-loosened energy, with crashing piano work and belted vocal lines that got people to start moving their bodies, not just their heads.  This was rock music, without a doubt, which was something that couldn’t necessarily be said of the earlier two groups.  Nothing was groundbreaking, and, at times, songs seemed to fuse into one piano-rock-y mass, but the performance was largely satisfying.
Throughout this concert, the music had been at times energized, other times more laid-back, but the audience hadn’t been quite sucked into the performances fully. There were those devoted friends right within saliva-range of the musicians, but for the most part it was a mulling, casual crowd that filled the dance floor.
Pinot changed that.
It was perhaps fitting that the band took such a long time to prepare – there was a nearly unbearable wait, interrupted by eardrum-shattering squeals of feedback – because when they arrived, boy, did they arrive.
Gone was the mellow.  Gone was the sense of indie sophistication.  What the audience got, however, was a band that was simply on another energy level — another energy universe, even.
The familiar funk aspects were all there: the blaring horns, the groovy shifting guitar and bass lines, the keyboard, but this wasn’t restrained in the least.
More than anything, the band burned with self-confidence. Its bomb-drop percussion (drum fills galore!) and tunes that were headbang-ready, all lead by a front man who commanded the stage from the get-go.
It’s easy to say that Pinot stole the night, absolutely demolishing the venue with its unbridled, straight-for-the-jugular ecstasy.  At one point the band led the audience in a crescendo of “Awwwwww sh*t!” and then busted out a tune with the primary lyric of “P-I-N-O-T, gonna f– you up”.
Musical maturity?  Maybe not.  But those who were in Ground Zero a little past 10 p.m. got a hell of a treat — true rock that created not only a show but a party.  But this was still only one quarter of a fantastic concert that, if anything, was reassuring for the quality music that was being born right here, right now, at the University of Southern California.

At a university of USC’s size, students often graduate without ever finding a faculty member to guide them through their college years and counsel them as they head into careers and the real world. But a few find faculty mentors whose perspective, wisdom and advice shapes their success at USC, and those mentors are trying to encourage others to take on the role.
Dr. Charles Gomer, a professor of pediatrics and radiation oncology for the Keck School of Medicine and vice chair of pediatrics for faculty development, co-chairs the Mellon Mentoring Forum, which honors outstanding faculty mentors for contributions to their colleagues or students as part of its annual award program.
“I feel very strongly and I think all the faculty here feel very strongly that we all want to give back now. We want to help other individuals just like the previous faculty have helped us,” Gomer said.
Gomer said he feels his educational and professional careers have been helped significantly by the presence of mentors, and he hopes to help current students find mentors.
“Each one made a difference,” he said, adding that mentoring is “a valuable asset we just can’t underestimate in this day in age to help people succeed.”
The school has been receptive to Gomer’s mission, he said, and strives to help create a mentoring relationship between faculty and students.
“The administration believes very, very strongly that mentoring should be an essential part of an outstanding university,” Gomer said. “It’s an indication from the university of how high they value this activity, that it is essential for the success of faculty or students.”
Gomer said he has noticed faculty at USC are typically open to taking on a mentorship role.
“We’re very fortunate at USC,” he said. “Our faculty want our students to succeed. There’s no doubt about that. And part of that is giving lectures and the coursework, but it goes beyond that. It’s outside the classroom where a lot of your learning goes on and that’s the mentoring process.”
Kara Bartelt, an assistant professor at the School of Architecture, received a Mellon Award last year, which is given to faculty mentoring undergraduate students. Bartelt said it was her experience with mentors that led her to want to be a mentor to others.
“I have been fortunate to have mentors in my life and education who took the extra time and effort to give personalized attention to my cause. They were critical to my growth and to my personal achievements,” Bartelt said. “The fact that I may now return the favor and play that role in someone else’s life is extremely rewarding to me now as a professor at USC.”
Paul Adler, a professor at the Marshall School of Business and a 2009 Mellon Award recipient for faculty mentoring faculty, said he feels it is important to collaborate and to share knowledge.
“Mentoring is a particularly rewarding facet of collegiality,” Adler said. “It is an exciting intellectual and human exchange expressing our shared commitment to advancing knowledge.”
But perhaps the most important aspect of the mentoring process is what the students get from it.
“It’s just been cool to have someone that’s doing something that you’re interested in doing and you can look to them as a good example,” said Laura Klein, a senior majoring in civil engineering who does research with her faculty mentor and professor, Dr. Burcin Becerik-Gerber.
Klein said she has never had a problem finding enough people to go to for advice but that her mentor was especially supportive of her higher education plans post-graduation.
Lauren Weinzimmer, a senior majoring in communication and English, works closely with Stacy Smith, a communication professor, and Alison Trope, her thesis adviser. She said both have helped make her college years an invaluable experience.
“Having faculty mentors and close relationships with professors has helped me really figure out what I want to do,” said Lauren Weinzimmer, a senior majoring in communication and English.  “I’ve had a lot of people that I have been able to go to and talk about my interests and graduate school.”
Weinzimmer plans to nominate her mentors for Mellon Awards this year.
Not all USC faculty members are as open to fostering mentorship relationships with their students, Weinzimmer said, though she has found the faculty are generally more accessible to their students and invest more time in them at private universities.
“What makes USC different from a lot of other universities is that the faculty are really invested in their students, and not just in their graduate students, but in their undergraduates,” she said.

In response to the ongoing construction on and around campus, USC Transportation has made temporary changes to its tram and Campus Cruiser operations to minimize traffic delays and adverse effects on commuters.
Waiting · Construction around campus has caused some delays to service by USC Transportation’s tram and the Campus Cruiser program. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
According to Jeff Shields, associate director of operations for USC Transportation, Transportation has experienced some periodic disruptions because of traffic caused by construction — particularly the construction of the new Exposition Light Rail Transit Line.
Though the trams and Campus Cruisers are following their usual operational schedule, Transportation has made adjustments to its services because of detours and road closures.
“[The construction] has certainly required us to think outside of the box in order to accommodate our customer base, and I believe we have done a good job of communicating changes to the campus community,” Shields said.
Students who use the tram service to get around campus generally said the ongoing construction has not had any significant effect on their experiences.
“It hasn’t affected me because I take the A route and it doesn’t go to where the construction is being held,” said Jenny Paredes, a graduate student studying accounting. “The construction is over there on Exposition [Boulevard] so I don’t see why it would affect my route.”
Brittaney Robinson, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said the natural variation in the tram’s arrival times makes it hard to tell if construction has caused any delays.
“I feel like it’s the same. The Track a Tram on the [transportation] website has helped a little, but you never know when it’s going to come,” Robinson said.
Students and faculty who take USC transportation from Union Station also noted the construction has had no discernible effect on their commute.
“I haven’t noticed any difference,” said Jefferey Sellers, an associate professor of political science who regularly rides the USC shuttle to work from Union Station.
Shields said he has received some complaints from commuters about the lack of updates about construction developments but pointed out that USC Transportation often does not have access to that information.
“Unfortunately, we don’t always receive the information ourselves, [but] we have taken a very proactive approach by attending meetings with the various contractors on campus as well as the Expo Line in order to improve in this area,”  Shields said.
Timely communication with the public will be a priority while construction continues to minimize inconvenience for commuters, Shields said.
“We try and e-mail the campus community timely in an effort to notify them of any potential delays and changes to the traffic patterns on and around campus,” he said.

I have a confession to make. I am no longer a virgin to snow.
During winter break, for two glorious days, I saw snow fall to the ground for the very first time. 
Contently watching from indoors while white powder peacefully rose above the windowsill like the ocean tide, the L.A. native inside of me wept for joy. That is, until I realized that four feet of snow equated to at least two hours of shoveling the driveway, a task as foreign to me as traveling more than 5,500 miles away to study abroad.
This semester, I will be living in London, the capital of the United Kingdom and one of the world’s largest financial centers.
Located on an island comparable in size to Alabama, London is estimated to have a population of about seven million (three-fourths that of greater Los Angeles).
With a history spanning more than 2,000 years, London has survived plagues, fires, wars and terrorist attacks. The Romans conquered the area in 43 A.D., naming their town Londinium and building the famed London Bridge.
By the 1660s, London was the largest city in Britain, but, in 1666, it was stricken to ashes from its first Great Fire, which blazed through the center of the city. In 2005, London was rocked by bombings that targeted the public transportation system, killing 52 people traveling during the morning rush hour.
The city has withstood so much damage over the years, I think it can handle my presence for the next five months.
With such a long stretch ahead, however, living abroad seems like almost as much backbreaking work as digging my car out of snow. I don’t have any experience with either, which leaves me feeling a little unprepared — like I’m running naked through the middle of a blizzard.
But as much as I feel like assuming the fetal position and crying for mommy at the thought of living in another country for the semester, I know that the beginning of a journey always seems the toughest. So to ease some pre-departure anxieties, I decided to consult my friend and confidante Google.
Like Los Angeles, London has the cultural necessities of any urban city — music hubs, shopping, parks and museums — but its novelty comes from the fact that these attractions have a history incomparable to anything on this side of the Atlantic.
Music lovers can appreciate walking across the famed Abbey Road or heading over to Denmark Street to investigate the birth of musical geniuses. Also known as Tin Pan Alley, the area houses music shops and studios where musicians, such as the Rolling Stones and The Kinks, recorded in the 1970s.
Hopping on the Tube, the underground subway, and stopping at Oxford Street will take you to one of the busiest shopping areas in the city. Everything from the U.K. department store Selfridges to American favorite Urban Outfitters can be found on this side of the fashion capital.
Unlike the suburban sprawl of Los Angeles though, London is an urban landscape full of parks and open spaces. Just a short walk away from Oxford Street is Hyde Park, a Royal Park of London that houses a memorial to the late Princess Diana. And the National Gallery which boasts the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Vincent Van Gogh.
Currently, the United Kingdom is experiencing one of its coldest winters since 1963. On average, the temperature has been teetering near freezing — a degree unheard of in Los Angeles.
Although January might not seem like the best time to be in London, it’s actually much easier to sightsee in the wintertime. Most attractions are still open, and the weather drives away the pushy tourists that blind you with their Bermuda shirts and flashy cameras.
Winter also lets you visit some of the city’s most famous tourist destinations in a way accessible only once a year. You can glide past the Tower of London, Somerset House or the Natural History Museum, while you practice your spins and triple salchows on outdoor ice skating rinks only a stone’s throw away.
So despite being one of the first to complain when it dips below 60 degrees, I’m hoping that by the time spring comes along and melts away the snow, I will have finally warmed up to the city enough to call it a second home.
As I stared blankly at the untouched driveway covered in snow, pondering how to approach my current dilemma, I once again turned to my trusted Internet source to point me in the right direction. It furnished me with an insightful piece of advice that applies to more than just shoveling snow.
“Make a pathway with your own footprints … This may be more easily said than done.”

Bands often struggle to maintain a balance between commercial success and artistic merit. Spoon, a four-piece band from Austin, Texas, has grappled with this difficulty continuously throughout its 15-year career. The band has long been hailed as a forerunner of the indie-rock scene, creating several critically acclaimed albums and establishing a loyal fan base. But some of the band’s songs — “The Underdog” and “The Way We Get By,” among others — have leaked into mainstream pop culture, appearing in several movies including 17 Again and television shows like The O.C. After nearly a decade of building on their past success, Spoon found itself at a crossroads familiar to talented bands everywhere.
Getting by · After the mainstream success of its 2007 release  Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, Spoon stripped down its style for Transference. - Photo courtesy of Merge Records 
With Tuesday’s release of Transference, the band’s fifth full-length album with independent Merge Records, Spoon demonstrated its pointed indifference to the allure of commercial success, trading the formula of well-produced, complex melodies behind 2007’s enormously successful Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga for an album defined by spare, minimalist tracks that lack the mass appeal of the previous release. Much of the record suggests the same sense of slow-moving, almost lazy apathy.
Many of the songs on the final version of Transference are actually demo recordings, and the production quality shows. While many of the group’s most successful songs from previous albums included discernible, memorable melodies and a variety of instruments — listen for the horn section in “The Underdog,” for instance — most of the songs on Transference lack any additional instrumentation besides drums, keyboard, guitar and bass.
The first few songs, “Before Destruction,” “Is Love Forever?” and the nearly five-minute-long “The Mystery Zone” are slow-paced tracks that begin with a certain rhythm and groove and rarely deviate from such throughout the rest of the song. Lead singer Britt Daniel often repeats a certain phrase or string of lyrics (usually the name of the title track) as the rhythm continues in the background, a form of repetition typical of Spoon songs. There’s no question that these songs can easily transfix listeners and leave them begging for more, but, when “The Mystery Zone” strangely and abruptly cuts off in the middle of a groove at the 4:59 mark, it only proves that the song wasn’t heading toward any interesting change in style or pace in the first place. After the track randomly ends, it only dives into the equally slow-paced, repetitive and relaxed groove of “Who Makes Your Money.”
By no means does the album’s relaxed pace and stripped-down feel detract from its overall quality. On the contrary, the fact that Spoon is able to produce unique and enjoyable songs without the use of fine-tuned production techniques  demonstrates Spoon’s talent and ability as a band.
On the ballad “Goodnight Laura,” lead vocalist Daniel sings quietly over a piano throughout the entire song, creating the album’s most drastically minimalist track. Daniel’s voice, however, has always sounded somewhat slow and lazy — one of Spoon’s most distinctive characteristics — so the simplicity of pared-down tracks like “Goodnight Laura” is different in a good way, though not entirely unexpected.
“Written In Reverse” is Transference’s first single and — not surprisingly — the most radio-friendly track on the album. During the song, piano and electric guitars clash and collide over a powerful drumbeat as Daniel trades his usual slow singing for loud, passionate belting and screaming.
Similar to a novel that is boring  throughout the first few chapters, it takes a few songs before Transference truly kicks into gear and picks up intensity and complexity. “I Saw the Light” draws upon the energy of “Written in Reverse,” resulting in another fast-paced, complex track. “Got Nuffin,” a similarly upbeat song, has already been used on the NBC comedy Chuck, which may be the band’s half-hearted attempt at maintaining its commercial success.
Other than those three, the album maintains its relaxed, slow pace. It almost seems as if the band is purposefully attempting to detach itself from the success of previous albums and singles, as the production quality is intentionally less polished and the memorable melodies are absent for a reason. In the process of negotiating the precarious balance between commercial success and artistic merit, Transference ultimately lands Spoon somewhere in the middle. The artistic quality is there and the commercial appeal is perhaps purposefully avoided, but only time will tell whether or not the band’s enormous audience will be able to digest the differences of Transference. Either way, Spoon has once again demonstrated its ability to craft an enjoyable album comprised of a unique group of songs.

Primal instinct tells us to be wary of too many rhyming words.
Cautionary tales of show titles that have failed to deliver reverberate in the mind of the frequent concertgoer, who, from experience, has learned to be suspicious of performances that promise an experience too broad to be covered in a few hours. Last Thursday’s free concert in Bovard Auditorium — extravagantly headlined “From Bebop to Doo-Wop to Hip Hop” — boasted a “musical journey through the African Disapora.”
Soulful · Thursday night’s event was organized by professor Ronald McCurdy. Daily Trojan | Vicki Yang
Even with piqued interest and elevated hopes, disappointment did not ensue. The show took viewers on a historical adventure in the evolution of African-American music, with panel discussions and musical selections intercutting each other so seamlessly that it would be difficult to argue whether the music or the dialogue made a greater impact in the hearts of audience members.
Almost before the ushers could quiet the excited crowd, the stage began to glow blue. Without warning, the show unfolded itself as student musicians whetted audience appetites with engaging examples of the respective genres of bebop, doo-wop and hip-hop. Eyes followed the spotlight as it jumped from the bebop band onstage to the four-man chorale on the left. Music did not wait, the opening number seemed to say, and neither did freedom nor justice nor the perpetual fight against oppression. Crisp trumpet notes introduced those in attendance to Dr. Ronald C. McCurdy, Thornton professor and moderator of the event.
The show began with a brief overview of the origins of African-American music from the slave trade era, in which music served the dual purpose of praising God and planning escape. Indeed, the common ancestor of bebop, doo-wop and hip-hop was firmly rooted in spiritual grounds, lending an unusual sonorous quality to all three genres. The showcase then launched into a rendition of “The Eternal Triangle” by Sonny Stitt, followed by an exploration of the vocal-based R&B style of doo-wop. Then, hip-hop, the genre most familiar to younger audience members, took on a new meaning as an instrument of social justice, with renowned rapper Tupac Shakur at its head as “defender of humanity.”
Panel discussions featured guest speakers such as Professor Jody Armour, famed saxophonist, bebop master James Moody and Leila Steinberg, past mentor and manager for Tupac. Expansive in its breadth and impressive in its depth, the event attracted many students and community members to Bovard.
The night culminated with a grand finale — a “cherry on top” in the form of an original composition incorporating elements from the three title genres of bebop, doo-wop and hip-hop. The mash-up of these instrumentations felt natural and uplifting. After all, they hailed from the same humble origin. The final performance, however, included a surprise element — the inclusion of the USC Kazan Taiko Ensemble. Some, justifiably, felt that traditional Japanese drums were out of place amid brass and keys, but perhaps the unexpected incorporation was meant to suggest a model of society based on the all-inclusive nature of music.
Soulful · Thursday night’s event featured student musicians such as Michael Mctaggart. - Daily Trojan | Vicki Yang
At first glance, posters advertising the event suggested an ordinary concert. Perhaps some students poured into Bovard expecting to be passively entertained, to be carried along in the smooth flow of melody — those students were mistaken.
The performance pulled listeners in, held them in rapt attention and engaged them in a life lesson through staggering tremolos. It taught us that poetry and music are inextricably tied and that the true musician considers himself duty-bound to embellish the composer’s work with a personal touch. It taught us to embrace the loosening of our borders, between politics and song, freeform improvisation and rigid adherence to the written score. More than anything, it cried to us in the rich bass vibrato of Reverend Charles A. Tindley’s “We Shall Overcome.” The concert was an ambitious project that promised to at once enlighten, inspire and entertain. It kept its promise.
There is one astonishing aspect of the night’s performance that handily trumped the rest — all of the performers are proud to call themselves Trojans. “From Bebop To Doo-Wop To Hip Hop,” a joint effort of Visions and Voices and the USC Thornton School of Music, collected some of the university’s finest musicians and social commentators, meshed together three distinctive products of African-American expression and showcased the result to an enthusiastic full house.
A full house on a Thursday night stands as evidence of a performance well-executed.
The event lived up to its colorful name. After all, what could students do but sway to the rhythm of the beat, mindful of the past and hopeful for the future?

The sun was a welcome sight on Saturday morning as the No. 1 USC men’s tennis team (2-0, 0-0) embarked on its dual-match season with two victories against Loyola Marymount (0-1, 0-0) and UC Santa Barbara (1-2, 0-0).
Multiple scorer · Senior Robert Farah partnered with sophomore Steven Johnson to capture a doubles point for the Trojans against LMU on Saturday. Later, Farah earned a singles victory against UC Santa Barbara. - Sunhil Murali | Daily Trojan 
The week’s turbulent weather affected the action, as the first match against LMU was delayed 1 hour 27 minutes to allow the Marks Tennis Stadium courts to dry up.
The delay did not hurt the Trojans, however, as they dominated the Lions 7-0.
Doubles play was competitive as the No. 13 duo of senior Robert Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson held off the No. 60 team of junior Ivan Lopez and sophomore Otto Sauer 8-6 to secure the doubles point for the Trojans.
In the singles portion, USC demonstrated their depth and skill with commanding performances across the board. At the second singles slot, No. 116 junior Jaak Poldma highlighted the strong play with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over No. 87 Lopez. Poldma displayed a powerful forehand that Lopez could not handle the entire match.
Also featured in singles were victories by No. 14 ranked Farah (6-2, 6-1) over Sauer, No. 47 sophomore Matt Kecki (6-3, 6-1) over senior Renzo Maggi and freshman Joel Giger (6-2, 6-3) over freshman Zeke Hindle.
The second match was not as easy going, as the Trojans held off the Gauchos 4-3. USC swept the doubles portion, highlighted by the exciting comeback victory of junior Peter Lucassen and Poldma, who defeated freshmen Benjamin Recknagel and Lucas Sudow 9-8 (3). The USC duo was down 4-7 but stormed back to secure the sweep in doubles.
The top three singles players carried the Trojans, as they faced some adversity from UCSB. In the decisive match, No. 1 ranked Johnson was in command of the match, then had his serve broken by junior Alex Koningsfeldt to tie up the second set 4-4. Johnson responded by taking three of the next four games to seal the 6-3, 7-5 victory.
At the end of the long day, the injury bug hit junior Daniel Gliner as he fought through a tough loss to Recknagel 6-1, 4-6, 1-0 (10-5). Gliner was in the midst of a comeback when he suffered cramps in the middle of the second set. In the end, he could not overcome the injury during the tiebreak.
The day started off well for the Trojans but ended on a bit of an underwhelming note.
“We didn‘t play to our full potential, but you have to give credit to UCSB. They played really well,” USC coach Peter Smith explained.
Even with some disappointment, there were plenty of brilliant performances. Lucassen stood out to coaches as he excelled during his first taste of collegiate tennis.
“Most impressively, Peter Lucassen went 4-0 for the day,“ Smith said.
Sophomore Daniel Nguyen also played notably by sweeping the two doubles and one singles match he participated in.
“The experienced players really came through today,” Smith noted.
The veterans might have won the day, but equally importantwas allowing all of the players to compete.
All players were able to participate in at least one match because of the doubleheader format.
“It was important to let everyone know the pressure on court,” Smith said.
Some questions, especially about the lineup, remain unanswered, but Smith will continue to mix in different combinations to find the right fit.
For the Trojans, the outcome of the day’s matches held mixed results, but Smith and the team come away with added experience, as the doubleheader allowed USC to play more oppoents than they could have scheduled otherwise.

While the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team’s first month of action has been full of uplifting victories and thrilling comebacks, the top team had failed to really dominate a match from start to finish despite its impressive record (5-1) heading in to Friday night’s showdown with the UCSD Tritons.
Hard hitter · Junior outside hitter Tri Bourne had 11 kills and hit .368 from the field as the Trojans swept their second straight opponent. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
It seems, however, a little home cooking was all the Trojans needed to find their stride.
In only the team’s second home match of the season Friday night, USC pasted the Tritons (2-5, 1-3) at the Galen Center in a three-set sweep (30-24, 30-24, 30-21). The Trojans, who improved to 6-1 on the season and a perfect 4-0 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference, easily maintained control of the match — thanks in large part to their fast start.
The team, which has now matched the 2000 Trojans for the best start in school history, used a 4-0 start to the match and a hitting percentage of .333 in the first set to set an early tone in what was arguably its most efficient performance thus far.
The only scare for the Trojans came in the second set, when the team fell behind UCSD 14-11. But behind the tremendous efforts of sophomore middle blocker Andrew Pizula — who had a match-high 10 digs — and 2009 All-American junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy — who had a match-high 17 kills — USC scored 7 of the set’s final 9 points en route to an impressive 30-24 victory.
The flow of the final set was once again dictated by the Trojans, who finished the match by tallying seven of the set’s final eight points, capped by an ace from Troy.
For USC, the victory marks the second straight match in which the team failed to drop a set. In addition to the big nights from Pizula and Troy, the Trojans also received notable contributions from outside hitters sophomore Tony Ciarelli and junior Tri Bourne, who chipped in with 12 and 11 kills, respectively.
“Sweeping a team means a lot for us because it means we were able to maintain quality play throughout each of our matches — without letting up,” Bourne said. “This kind of consistency is what we are looking for.”
The match also marks the last time the Trojans will play in front of their home crowd in January, as the team embarks on another grueling road trip starting Friday night against No. 7 Pepperdine. Home sweeps of Long Beach State and UCSD not only padded the Trojans record with impressive victories but has instilled much-needed momentum within the team and a sense of excitement for the tough matchups in store in the deep MPSF.
“We’re all excited to get back into the hostile environment that we will face Friday at Pepperdine,” Bourne said. “I think that we have proven to ourselves that we are the No. 1 team in the country, but we all know that we are far from playing our best.”
Who’s the xMoronx who writes this stuff??
Andrew Pizula is the libero and not a middle blocker.

With yet another come-from-behind victory, the Women of Troy women’s basketball team is off to their best conference start in five seasons.
USC (12-6, 6-1) beat Washington State on the road 61-51 despite trailing at halftime for the fifth straight game. The Women of Troy have won four of those five games.
Double threat · Senior guard/forward Aarika Hughes filled up the stat sheet on Saturday, contributing eight points and nine rebounds. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The recent spate of success USC has enjoyed notwithstanding, senior guard/forward Aarika Hughes said the team has to be ready to play hard from the opening tip.
“I think it’s just getting our heads in the game and focusing from the get-go,” Hughes said. “We’ve proven we can come back in games but it’d be nice if we didn’t wait until the second half to turn it on.”
The Women of Troy jumped out to an early six-point lead and looked like they would cruise to victory, but an inability to keep Washington State (5-13, 0-7) off the offensive glass allowed the Cougars to get back into the game. Washington State held a five-point advantage going into halftime.
“It’s tough to win on the road no matter where you go, but at the same time we need to come out and play better defense and box out better,” sophomore guard Ashley Corral told the USC All-Access.
Hughes and sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath helped USC pull out the victory despite a lackluster shooting performance by Corral, who missed all five of her shot attempts in the first half. Hughes finished with eight points and nine rebounds while Gilbreath scored 11 of her game-high 17 points in the first half.
Despite Gilbreath’s hot start, the Women of Troy still found themselves trailing early as the Cougars grabbed one offensive rebound after another. Washington State collected most of its 21 offensive rebounds in the first half. At halftime, Hughes said USC coach Michael Cooper told his team to go out and play.
“Him and [assistant] coach Monier really couldn’t tell us anything as far as X’s and O’s,” Hughes said. “They just told us to go out there, play hard and get it done whichever way we could.”
Part of getting it done included Corral breaking out of her shooting slump. Corral scored all 10 of her points after intermission and sealed the win for USC in the final minute by banking in a jumper as the shot clock expired.
Freshman forward Christina Marinacci also helped USC escape Pullman, Wash. with a win. Marinacci scored six points and gave the Women of Troy a boost off the bench.
“She definitely comes in off the bench and gives us a spark of energy,” Hughes said. “Her energy alone carries us when we get into those lulls.”
Those lulls in energy have been a recent issue for the Women of Troy. USC has trailed in all five of its conference victories this season, and the players are all too aware that they cannot rely on making a comeback every game.
“It’s not the greatest way to win,” Hughes said. “We need to make sure that we don’t always get behind early.”
USC kept its hold on second place in the conference with the victory. The Women of Troy take on Oregon and Oregon State this week at the Galen Center.

Now that was a little bit ridiculous.
With six minutes left in Saturday’s game against Washington, USC had a comfortable lead and total control of the game.
The score was 69-48, a few fans were starting to pile out of the Galen Center and an impressive win was seemingly on the way for USC. 
Then redshirt senior point guard Mike Gerrity and redshirt senior forward Marcus Johnson connected on an alley-oop dunk for the ages — a dynamic display of just about everything good in the world of sports.
A perfect synergy of instinct, skill and luck; a beautiful rendezvous between ball and player just above the rim; a meeting of two objects — ball and player.
Quite simply, it left everyone in the building in utter disbelief.
“He did not throw a lob right now,” redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson said postgame, describing his initial reaction to seeing Gerrity heave the ball from beyond midcourt. “Tell me he did not throw a lob right now.”
He did, Alex.
Gerrity caught a pass from sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic, dribbled twice and hurled the ball towards the vicinity of the basket.
Gerrity said afterward that his football skills were horrible, but I’d venture to say he was probably just being humble — I’d like to see USC quarterback Matt Barkley make that throw.
Anyways, while the ball was in the air, Johnson was running down the court.
Somewhere mid-flight, he said he got the idea that he should jump to meet the ball.
Good decision, Marcus.
Just after that came the monstrous slam that electrified the crowd to never-before-seen levels.
But it’s not the first time Gerrity and Johnson have connected on an alley-oop. And it’s definitely not the first time Johnson has ignited the Galen Center crowd with a big dunk.
Finisher · Senior forward Marcus Johnson, shown here against Tennessee, was at the receiving end of a crowd pleasing alley-oop. - Seth Rubinroit | Daily Trojan 
In the area of alley-oops, they’re both old hands.
Gerrity, an altogether average athlete, has one redeeming factor that has propelled him to success at the college level: He’s got the vision of an NBA-caliber point guard.
Teammates have been saying it since they met him.
Guard Jio Fontan, who’s sitting this season after transferring from Fordham, told me a couple weeks ago that he had so much to learn from watching Gerrity pass.
This alley-oop slam is only the latest manifestation of Gerrity’s passing ability — in short, he just knows how to dish.
And Johnson is similarly talented in his field — the field of dunking.
Many USC fans first learned Johnson’s name after his spectacular posterization of Cal’s Jorge Gutierrez last February, and the dunks have kept coming since.
“It’s just stupid what he can do in the air,” Stepheson said of Johnson,
No, Alex, that’s not stupid at all.
What Johnson can do in the air is quite amazing actually.
That man can jump.
In practice, in games, heck, just about anywhere — that man can jump.
And the Galen Center crowd is just the beneficiary of this teamwork, the witnesses to an alley-oop dunk for the ages.
So while only 11 games remain for the Trojans this year no matter their record, this season isn’t a total waste.
Not at all.
This Gerrity-Johnson connection will be remembered for years to come as the alley-oop heard ’round Los Angeles.
Never mind that it took place in an already decided game, never mind that it took place in front of fewer than 6,000 fans and never mind that it won’t really affect the season of the team it benefited.
None of that matters.
There is always something to be said of the beauty of an alley-oop dunk.
Always.

Just two days after blowing a 15-point lead against Washington State, the USC men’s basketball team (12-7, 4-3) showed it could learn from its past mistakes by throttling Washington (12-7, 3-5) 87-61 at the Galen Center on Saturday night.
Bounce-back · After missing all seven of his attempts from the field against Washington State last Tuesday, sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic added a double-double of 11 points and 13 rebounds in the Trojan’s blowout victory on Saturday. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
Redshirt senior forward Marcus Johnson led the Trojans with a career-high 22 points, including a highlight reel-worthy alley-oop dunk off of a half-court lob from redshirt senior guard Mike Gerrity that ignited the home crowd. Senior guard Dwight Lewis added 19 points, scoring 14 of them in the second half after sitting out a large part of the first half because of foul trouble.
“We’re fighting to win a Pac-10 championship,” junior forward Alex Stepheson said. “We’re just learning from every game. We really stressed that [tonight] to cut down turnovers, just play good defense, and take good shots.”
The Trojans showed off an offensive attack rarely seen from the team this season, scoring a season-high 87 points.
“We looked to push the ball, but defense is our staple,” Johnson said. “When we get stops and we rebound the ball well, we’re able to push the ball and get those kind of offensive opportunities.”
The Trojans opened the game with a double-digit lead for the third game in a row, leading the Huskies 19-6 after just seven minutes of play. They didn’t let up from there, posting 42 points in the first half as Gerrity scored the Trojans’ final eight points before the break.
USC’s defense continued to shine as Washington star Quincy Pondexter was held to just two points in the first half, shooting 25 percent from the field.
USC also showed that it could spread the ball around effectively, opening the second half with all five starters scoring in the first seven minutes. Eighty-two of the points came from the Trojans’ starting five players, who also accounted for 28 of the team’s 32 rebounds.
The combination of a high-energy offense coupled with stifling defense proved to be too much for the Huskies, as the Trojans shot 60 percent from the 3-point line and forced seven turnovers in the half.
“Our guys did a great job of moving the ball,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “And when we defend like we did [on Saturday], we always have a chance to win.”
But the single most influential point of the game came from Johnson with 6:16 left to play and the Trojans up 23 points. Off a missed shot by the Huskies, Gerrity ran the ball to half court before throwing up a long lob pass toward a streaking Johnson. Johnson leaped from several feet beyond the lower block, caught the ball in midair and dunked it, bringing the crowd of 5,876 to its feet.
“I mean, if [Gerrity] throws it up, I’ll go get it,” Johnson said. “That’s the agreement we have.”
The win moved USC into a five-way tie for second place in the Pac-10, while the Huskies dropped to eighth place and are now 0-5 on the road this season. The loss comes just two days after the Huskies fell to UCLA on a buzzer-beater.
But according to O’Neill, the Trojans won’t be satisfied until they are at the top of the Pac-10.
“I’m frankly pissed that we aren’t in first, because we let a game get away from us the other night with a 15-point lead,” O’Neill said. “I know our guys are upset about that. That’s my hope for our team, that when we do have some tough times, we learn from them and become a better team and better individuals.”

I don’t have a Kindle, a Sony Reader or a Nook, mainly because I don’t have the money to buy one. I must admit the gadget-hungry fiend in me is aching to nab a new toy like an e-reader, but, as a print journalist and creative writer, I have to question the implications of e-books and e-readers creeping into our lives at an alarming rate.
The advantages of e-books are pretty obvious. They save paper and money, are easier to distribute and transport and don’t take up shelf space. For now, print media still exists as an important source of information and doesn’t seem to be in any serious danger of being phased out by e-books.
But for how long?
The e-book issue significantly affects both the education and entertainment sectors. In regards to education, e-books seem like a great replacement for heavy, expensive textbooks we dread buying at the start of each semester. Given that students are spending more and more time in front of the computer screen, switching to e-books in the classroom is practically a no-brainer win-win. Many universities (including USC) are already taking advantage of this, as many courses use PDFs as their primary classroom texts. However, full implementation of electronic textbooks is currently a difficult endeavor; Syracuse University and the University of Wisconsin at Madison recently rejected the use of Amazon’s Kindle DX to replace textbooks because of its inaccessibility to blind students.
As tempting as it might sound to reduce student costs by replacing print textbooks with electronic ones, that kind of model could jeopardize the educational content of those texts by starting a snowball effect.  If profits were to decrease, publishers, despite only giving around 7 to 15 percent royalties to the authors, would be forced to cut back and possibly pay authors even less. Consequently, the quality of available authors might decrease, leading to summarized, paraphrased and dumbed-down work to match publisher’s pay. The worst-case scenario of exclusively electronic textbooks would result in Kindles that basically only link to Wikipedia-esque content.
Thus, the coexistence of electronic and print textbooks must be maintained in order to protect educational content. Print textbooks, with their astronomically high prices, could use some competition from electronic textbooks to lower their prices. Likewise, electronic textbooks would benefit from a coexisting relationship with print,  making older texts available alongside newer ones and increasing the quality of material available to students.
Even with the books we like to pick up for leisure reading, e-books cannot stand alone as a replacement of print. However, there are some unique benefits of the electronic reader — with the Kindle Store, new authors bidding for popularity could offer their works for free and boost their rankings on online best-seller lists.
Of course, the story can’t end there— authors need to make money. It is unclear yet how successful free e-books can influence consumers to buy print copies of an author’s other works. According to a New York Times article, a few authors offering free e-books managed to increase the sales of their other books exponentially. However, e-books currently represent only 5 percent of the total book market, and most authors are still afraid of trying new media. Brian Murray, chief executive of HarperCollins, was quoted saying, “free is not a business model.”
E-books and print-books can have a positive relationship with each other, but the share they both take in the market is a crucial element to watch. E-books seem to be able to affect the sales of print books at a noticeable scale and could start to eventually take a larger chunk of the market, burdening print publications to the point of collapse.
I’m not ready to let go of the look and feel of the paperbacks on my bookshelf, but I am eager to try an e-reader. The gadget-hungry fiend and the writer in me will just have to get along if we’re going to make it in this market.

Imagine looking into the eyes of your significant other.  You’re about to tell her you love her, but she beats you to it — except she misspeaks or something.  “I see you,” she says, sweetly and meaningfully.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
Unless your girlfriend was formerly blind, you probably wouldn’t be impressed.  More likely you would wonder why the heck she just quoted the blue aliens from James Cameron’s newest film, Avatar. Recent scientific findings, however, suggest that we could learn a thing or two from the movie’s Na’Vi about leading successful and fulfilling relationships.
In this month’s issue of Scientific American, psychologist Robert Epstein discusses his research in an article called, “Fall in Love and Stay That Way.” He writes that one of the most effective exercises for intensifying love is what he calls “soul-gazing.”  Prolonged, mutual eye contact correlates with significant increases on tests that measure self reported feelings of love, even with total strangers — due in part, Epstein says, to heightened feelings of vulnerability.
“The Na’Vi have an experience of unity of consciousness with other beings, all of which (themselves included) are really just manifestations of one Being, which they call Ai’wa,” wrote Jay Michaelson, a Huffington Post columnist, in a December article.  He explained that the Na’Vi phrase for “I see you” is supposed to mean “the God in me sees the God in you,” communicating the perception of, and consequent unity with, another individual’s soul.
The connectedness of all life forms in the movie can be compared with that of the more than 100 billion neurons in the human brain.  Each cell in the human brain communicates with between 5,000 and 200,000 other neurons, transmitting chemicals back and forth through synapses, the spaces between the neurons  — like the end of a Na’Vi ponytail to the little hairs of their horses.
The human capacity for being similarly “one” with others seems practically nonexistent. It’s not like our eyes are actually transmitting anything when we look into someone else’s. And although we can sort of see each other’s thoughts by sharing information using language, we can’t actually unite consciousnesses with anybody, let alone with any God we might believe in.  Or can we?
Research suggests that mirror neurons, the cells in our brains that respond as if we were experiencing what someone else is experiencing, may hold capacities similar to the ones portrayed in the movie. Scientists have concluded that mirror neurons are largely responsible for empathy.  When you watch someone stubbing a toe, the firings in your brain “mirror” the other person’s, as though you were stubbing your toe.
Moreover, studies have shown that meditation can actually strengthen this effect.  In 2008, a University of Wisconsin study showed that meditation correlates with an increased firing capacity in mirror neurons — that meditating may be a legitimate way to increase compassion because people who meditate regularly show more pronounced mirror neuron activity than those who do not.  Some Eastern philosophers even believe meditation can put us in touch with a sort of all-permeating consciousness (not unlike the movie’s Ai’wa).
Spiritual beliefs aside, we might be able to make serious progress in the depths of our relationships by merging meditation with Epstein’s “soul-gazing.”
In high school, during a retreat intended to help my senior class bond, every student in our class of more than 120 was required to stare into the eyes of each other student for a full 60 seconds.  Our teachers told us that the experience, which would take multiple hours, would be more powerful than anything we could imagine.
For the first 45 minutes we were all snorting and rolling our eyes and feeling exceptionally awkward.  Then, someone in the complicated arrangement began to weep —  then somebody else (unmistakably a male, this time) did as well. I gradually realized my whole body was beginning to feel a bit tingly, like a foot falling asleep except it was a totally pleasant and uplifting sensation.
Pretty soon I was crying from the overwhelming intensity of the feeling. Looking into the eyes of my classmates, it was as if I could see through all of the superficial judgments I had made into something more profound; something that was reaching into me and communicating the same unconditional, selfless appreciation.
Recalling the experience, I believe our prolonged eye gazing induced a form of mass meditation, which combined with the eye contact itself helped us approach the capacity to “see” each other.
So now, imagine looking deeply into your lover’s eyes — or your enemy’s — for such a long time that your mind begins to clear.  Visualize the capacity to love anybody, genuinely and unselfishly, simply by looking.
Would you consent to see?

Correction: A sentence in the third paragraph originally read “Prolonged, mutual eye contact correlates with significant increases on tests that measure attraction, even with total strangers — due in part, Epstein says, to heightened feelings of vulnerability.”  The word “attraction,” which was changed during the editing process, implies a type of sexual attraction, which is not what the study was meant to convey.  The sentence now reads “Prolonged, mutual eye contact correlates with significant increases on tests that measure self reported feelings of love, even with total strangers — due in part, Epstein says, to heightened feelings of vulnerability.”
Jean.
Didn’t want to pass by without a leaving a comment on this article. It is well written and insightful. 
This sense of unity consciousness may not just be a fanciful thought. In truth, we may be hard wired with an inherent connection to each other and to other life forms. Empathy may be found within the lower brainwave patterns.
It is said that the eyes are the mirror to the soul. Even looking into the eyes of your pet as they look back at you creates an empathetic response.
I will tweet this article for further viewing.

Lynn Fishman RN & Founder of Brainwave Architect

Sometimes the best place to end is at home. For the Derik Nelson Band, that home is USC. Yet the band’s performance at Ground Zero’s Welcome Back Concert Friday has significance far beyond the sentimental. With most of the four-man band graduating in May, the group is determined to secure its USC legacy. In a special concert for their homegrown fan base, the band will play multiple songs from their new CD due out this spring. 
With a string of early successes – an upcoming CD, performances at the Troubadour and the Key Club, and an impressive amount of hype – it seems strange that December marked the band’s one-year anniversary.
Over a year ago, Nelson was a transfer student with a two-album solo career and dreams of something bigger. It wasn’t long before the music major met Jack Kovacs, who he describes as “the most amazing musician I have ever had the privilege of playing with or hearing.”
It wasn’t long before the Derik Nelson Band became a five-member team, with Nelson as the lead singer; Kovacs with guitar; Bert Gay as bass; Brian Hargrove as keys; and Ben Rose as drums.
They describe their style as pop with a little funk, jazz and rock, but deep down playing to their own beat. With majors ranging from guitar to physics, each member of the band brings his own influence.
Though Nelson admits he has a leadership position and considers himself to be the front man, all decisions are democratic.
“We see past our individual roles in the band and understand that what is important is the song and the performance,” Nelson said.
Freedom, however, is the band’s unifying strength. Nelson plans to pursue his solo career as a side project, while Ben Rose drums in many different gigs.
This freedom also encourages creative expression. All band members have a part in the lyrics, which Nelson, the original lyricist, believes gives their music greater variety.
Their new CD – tentatively called North – will showcase the band’s collaboration. With songs about relationships, conflicts and finding one’s past, the CD is a diary of five young college men.
“If people can really connect with what I am singing about and if, at the end of the concert, the whole room is on the same page, than it is a successful night in my terms,” Nelson said.
The Derik Nelson Band played at Ground Zero Friday night.
