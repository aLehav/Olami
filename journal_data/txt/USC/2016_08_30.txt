Science and art are two subjects typically kept on opposite sides of the scholarly spectrum. 
A group of USC students, however, is interweaving the two with the literary magazine, The Healing Process. The publication “combines health and art” and defies the mutual exclusivity of the two areas of study, said Natasha Natarajan, a senior majoring in human biology and The Healing Process’s co-editor-in-chief.
“Science alone is very powerful and art alone is very powerful, but together they create this new meaning that most people do not explore in their lifetime,” Natarajan said. “You can understand a lot more about health when you see it from the new perspective of art.”
The magazine, established in January 2013, receives art and writing submissions online from students, professors and doctors alike, especially from the USC community. 
“The magazine focuses on a holistic view of combining humanities and sciences,” said Kelsi Yu, the director of copy and acquisitions for The Healing Process. “With this, you can provide a thorough process of healing.”
Previously an annual magazine, Yu and the rest of the editors are working to make The Healing Process a biannual publication. 
Natarajan said the magazine plans on releasing their fifth edition by the end of the fall semester.
With around 500 copies per edition, the publication staff places copies in different offices and locations on campus, including the Thematic Option office, the pre-med office and in front of Leavey Library. They also share the magazine with various professors at the University.
In addition to increasing campus readership, Director of Marketing Jessica Nathania said the magazine’s current focus is to expand to other colleges, including UCLA. 
Nathania, who is also a member of the pre-dental honor society, is working on a project called “Spread the Smile” campaign. This campaign works with surrounding elementary schools by teaching them the basics of oral hygiene and nutritional counseling through images that are easy to understand. 
Nathania plans to develop her work with the “Spread the Smile” campaign into a submission for The Healing Process’s next edition. 
Though she said she is still brainstorming ideas, Nathania is thinking about photographing some students she works with and writing a piece about her work with them. Through this project, Nathania hopes to fulfill the publication’s mission of engaging pre-med students in deeper discussions about their chosen future profession.
“Our goal is to have students really think about how and why the activities that they do shape their desire to practice medicine, rather than just doing such activities to receive admission into medical school,” according to a statement on the organization’s website.
The Healing Process editors pride themselves on being the only magazine to combine health and humanities.
“Science is dense and hard to relate to, while art is a universal language,” Nathania said. “‘The Healing Process’ makes science more accessible [for everyone].”

The Undergraduate Student Government senators discussed how to fill vacant USG staff positions during Tuesday’s Senate meeting.
The main vacancy under discussion was for the director of academic affairs in the advocacy branch. The previous director of academic affairs, Sarah Dhanaphatana, resigned after accepting a full time internship. USG Vice President Austin Dunn nominated current Assistant Director of Philanthropy Fund Maariyah Patel for the position. He asked that the Senate vote confirm the nomination immediately, instead of voting on the issue at the next meeting, as is customary. 
When pressed by Sen. Sabrina Enriquez to explain the need for urgency, Dunn said that the position of director of academic affairs was one of the five most important positions in the advocacy branch. Failing to expedite the vote, Dunn said, would cause the process to take up to three weeks, impeding the initiatives that the advocacy branch intends to take on this semester.
Though Patel’s appointment would leave her current position in the funding branch vacant, that and other vacancies would be filled through an application set to be released at a later time. Those appointments will be made with greater transparency than last semester, in which then-Assistant Director of Elections and Recruitment Keith Keer filed a complaint about alleged cronyism in the hiring process. 
When asked if he and USG President Edwin Saucedo had considered other candidates before deciding to nominate Patel, Dunn said that only Patel and another assistant director had expressed interest in the position and stressed that Patel’s advocacy experience qualified her for the position.
“We were only considering people internally,” Dunn said. “This decision was made because we were fairly confident that, given [Patel’s] advocacy experience … [which] exceeds that of any other member of the advocacy branch currently, it was going to be a pretty easy decision.”
Patel began working in USG her freshman year, and previously served as the assistant director of academic affairs, as well as co-director of University Affairs alongside Dunn. When Sen. Kate Oh asked Patel why she wanted to move to the advocacy branch from her current position, Patel spoke about her years of experience in academic affairs. 
“I was in charge of academic policy and I was the one to pass the drop resolution that allowed students to not receive a ‘W’ until the seventh week, as well as change ‘Letter Grade’ to ‘Pass/Fail,’ so I have plenty of experience with administrations that are still in place and that I still have contact with,” Patel said. 
The motion for an immediate confirmation of Patel’s hire failed to reach the two-thirds threshold to pass, with five senators for and five against. The confirmation vote is scheduled to take place at the next Senate meeting.
During the questioning process, Patel expressed surprise at the amount of scrutiny given to her hire by the senators. Oh later said that though the typical procedure is to immediately confirm the appointments, senators were more hesitant to make a decision with Patel’s appointment given the accusations of cronyism against the funding board hires made at the end of last semester.
“Due to the experience we had as Senate last semester, I feel like we’re being far more cautious about our decisions,” Oh said. “It’s just us being more cautious and making sure that these appointments are the right appointments.”
Last semester, after the Senate had already confirmed the funding branch appointments made by Saucedo, it was brought to Oh’s and Enriquez’s attention that the funding board appointees were predominantly male, Oh said. Following those concerns, they looked more closely at the applications and began to suspect bias in the hiring process.
“It was because we were rushed into voting to suspend [parliamentary procedure], and with that, we appointed people to their positions without knowing much about the individuals who were appointed to the position, or why they were appointed for those positions, or why they were qualified to lead in those positions,” Oh said. 
In response to these concerns, the Senators voted to reverse their decision to confirm the appointments. However, their subsequent attempt to appeal the confirmation failed, so the funding board hires remained unaffected.
Oh said USG should look to increase transparency in its hiring process in order to avoid similar allegations in the future.
“I think that’s a job for not only Senate, but the president and VP. Greater transparency in the organization is never a bad thing,” Oh said. “I think there has to be communication and trust within each department, so that we can all function smoothly and effectively.”

I don’t think Clay Helton can beat Alabama. Of course, it won’t be just Helton out there on Saturday against the Crimson Tide. It’s not a chess match between him and Nick Saban. Coaches can only do so much.
But I don’t think Helton is the kind of coach who will lead USC to victory in “The Big One” anytime soon. He’ll be a perfectly good coach during his USC tenure, and a loss during the first game of his non-interim USC coaching career doesn’t necessarily entail doom for the rest of the season. Heck, the Trojans could pull off an upset against the defending national champions; I really do hope I’m wrong. 
Nonetheless, these aren’t the kinds of games Helton was brought in to win. Even if the spread was closer to a field goal than two touchdowns and there wasn’t quite the mismatch between his roster and Saban’s, I still wouldn’t feel the typical, invincible Arrogant Nation swagger I otherwise would while going into a heavyweight showdown. If the Trojans stick around with the Crimson Tide for the most part, but ultimately fall short of really competing for a victory, I think it will be a great indicator of what we can and can’t expect from his head coaching tenure. 
When Helton was officially promoted from interim to permanent football head coach last year, the move represented a call for consistency and stability after several seasons that were anything but. A dismissal on a tarmac, an emotional storm-off before a bowl game, a personal problem boiling over onto the field and plenty other twists and turns characterize the last five years of USC football better than any single victory or accomplishment. The noise surrounding those on the sideline has drowned out the actual performance of the Trojan student-athletes on the field — what the program should really be about.
That’s why former athletic director Pat Haden wanted to give Helton the keys to the program. By all accounts, he was a very well-liked and respected coach at USC as a quarterbacks’ coach, offensive coordinator and interim leader on two different occasions. He was the steadiest force on staff during a uniquely tumultuous period for Hollywood’s local team. He had arguably the best chance of making the most out of USC’s potential, putting an end to all the distractions and underwhelming on-field performances. 
With all that being said, he still comes in as a relatively unheralded former assistant. As a player, Helton’s career numbers at Houston included one touchdown and four interceptions in 16 games. He was brought onto the USC staff from Memphis, an unremarkable program previously playing in Conference USA. This is his first head coaching job. 
Maybe it’s a good thing, maybe it isn’t, but Helton was not the big name hire some had hoped for and felt that a program like USC should be able to pull off. Because as much as nostalgic USC fans like me need to get away from this, as unreasonable of an expectation as it is, Helton won’t be able to escape the shadow of the man who built the program he just inherited. 
Helton is no Pete Carroll. 
It’s impossible to make any sort of analysis of a USC football head coach in recent memory without bringing up Carroll’s name. Legendary is by no means an understatement. Even if it’s an exaggeration with regards to his actual accomplishments at the helm, it certainly isn’t with regards to the mythical status Carroll still holds among lifelong Trojan fans who experienced the glory of his peak. 
Carroll was the king of Southern California swagger. Even though he had three different Heisman trophy winners during his tenure with USC, it was Carroll who was the star, the larger-than-life figure defining the persona of Trojan football. No one could stop USC, and there was no big game the Trojans wouldn’t win. 
There’s one very notable exception to that rule, arguably the biggest and most important of all the games he coached. But even when factoring in the 2005 National Championship game loss to Texas, Carroll and the Trojans put up a remarkable record in big games. 
His record includes two Orange Bowl wins, four Rose Bowl wins, an epic Bush Push victory in 2005 during the biggest game in the recent history of the Notre Dame rivalry, a 66-19 beatdown of UCLA in 2005 (the last time both teams played while ranked around the AP Top-10), a victory over a No. 6 Auburn team in 2003 en route to a national championship and two victories over Ohio State in 2008 and 2009, which were the last times the Trojans had big name non-conference games on the early schedule. Given that Carroll won six of seven BCS bowl games and then essentially was never beaten in the regular season by an evenly-matched regular season opponent, it’s hard not to call the Carroll era a dynasty. 
The downfall for Carroll, though, was that the dynasty was prone to huge upsets. It was almost never a team that could reasonably compete with the Trojans derailing their season. It was always a team the Trojans should have beaten. I still think USC had the best football team in the country in 2006, 2007 and 2008, but losses to unranked opponents in times before the four-team playoff prevented the Trojans from ever validating that in the national championship that year. 
That’s why this matchup against Alabama feels so similar to USC’s home-and-home with Ohio State in 2008 and 2009 or the 2003 Auburn tilt, even though the ranking disparity this year is much greater. The ’08 Trojans came in as the No. 1 team against a No. 5 Ohio State, then were ranked No. 3 against the No. 8 Buckeyes in 2009. 2003 featured a No. 8 USC vs. a No. 6 Auburn. The Trojans aren’t really coming in on the same level as No. 1 Alabama this year — the AP has USC as a legitimate underdog at No. 20. 
But this feels like the kind of game Pete Carroll would win. Why? Because he just would. Even with the very same roster against a defending national champion Alabama team, every single player in Carroll’s locker room would unequivocally believe that they were about to win that game, which they would then go do.   
But Pete Carroll probably wouldn’t lead USC past Utah State the following week. In both ’08 and ’09, immediately after taking down top-10 Ohio State teams, the Trojans lost the following week against unranked conference opponents — at Oregon State in ’08 and at Washington in ’09.
That’s the essential tradeoff between Helton and Carroll. The Trojans will win the games they are supposed to under Helton. But it will be some time before USC goes into every game expecting to win with him at the helm. 
Time will tell whether this style materializes into a national championship during Helton’s tenure. Win the conference enough times and appear in the College Football Playoff enough times, and Helton will hopefully break through at least once and win it all. If he can do it within the next decade, then I would put him on that same level that Carroll occupies. 
But that’s a long ways away. For now, USC is not really on the same level as an Alabama. Heck, Stanford and even UCLA might be the best two teams in the conference for the next couple of seasons. 
Helton just needs a strong start. Even if the Trojans fall short of winning on Saturday, he can still set the tone for the future of the season — and the future of the program — just by sticking around. 
Luke Holthouse is a senior majoring in policy, planning and development and print and digital journalism. His column, “Holthouse Party,” runs on Wednesday.
The exact same things were said about Carroll during his first unremarkable season. If Helton doesn’t cut it for you, I suggest going to alabama or michcigan state where they have the type of “big name” you’re looking for. Regardless of what you think about Helton, he is still our coach and the team is still our team. Support them. Their job is hard enough without everyone having no faith in them. It doesn’t matter if we win or lose on Saturday, we will still be Trojans, our team and our coach will still be Trojans, and that is a lot more important and noteworthy. Support, don’t undermine your fellow Trojans. Its called the Trojan Family for a reason.
I’m just happy I went to USC during the Pete Carroll era. It was a different zeitgeist then. 
Naive optimism is a lot better than being pessimistic.

The hype surrounding Saturday’s matchup between No. 1 Alabama and No. 20 USC has been cranked to another degree. All of the buzz surrounding this contest leads to one question, “Is this the biggest season opener in the history of USC football?”
To thoroughly answer this question, one must revisit some of the more memorable season-opening contests which the Trojans have played in the past. USC has had a tradition of performing well in season openers, and this remains true today — the Trojans have not lost a season opener in the last 17 years. Several defining moments in the program’s history have come during these season-opening match-ups, including:
1962: vs. Duke
In 1962, former USC Trojans head coach John McKay was entering his third season at the helm of the University’s football program.  USC came away with a 14-7 victory over Duke. This victory would be the first of many for the Trojans in 1962, as the team would go on to win McKay’s first national title that season. Beyond starting the season 1-0, the victory was crucial in turning around McKay’s tenure as head coach. Over his first two seasons, McKay earned an 8-11-1 record. McKay finished his career as a legendary four-time national champion coach for the Trojans and producing two Heisman winners. 
2003: at Auburn
The USC Trojans, then ranked No. 8, entered Jordan-Hare Stadium in Alabama to kick off their 2003 season against the then-No. 6 Auburn Tigers. USC would go on to dominate the game, shutting out the Tigers, 23-0. The contest also featured the debut of quarterback Matt Leinart as a starter. The first pass  went for a 5-yard touchdown to former wide receiver Mike Williams. 
The win for USC was the beginning of a 12-1 season for the Men of Troy in which they also won the first of two consecutive national championships. The decisive victory against a top-10 opponent also further confirmed that the Trojans’ run to the Orange Bowl in the 2002 season was by no means a fluke. 
2004: at Virginia Tech
Following their 2003 national title season, USC entered 2004 ranked as the undisputed No. 1 team in the nation. The Trojans began their national title defense by defeating Virginia Tech 24-13 in a tough neutral site game. 
In a contest in which they trailed 10-7 at halftime, USC powered back in the second half to earn its first win of 2004. A standout performance from former running back Reggie Bush — five receptions for 127 receiving yards — helped the Trojans outscore the Hokies 17-3 in the second half for the victory. Many consider this season’s opening contest against Virginia Tech the birth of the Reggie Bush era. 
The Trojans dominated in 2004, winning their second consecutive national championship. USC went 13-0 and maintaining the No. 1 ranking all season long.
Saturday: vs. Alabama
This contest has all the potential to be the biggest season opener in USC football history — if the Trojans can come away with a win. Should No. 20 USC pick up the victory against the Crimson Tide, the team would instantly find itself in talks for a berth for the College Football Playoff. One could hardly imagine a more ideal start to the Clay Helton era should USC come out on top. If redshirt junior quarterback Max Browne can leave AT&T Stadium with a win Saturday, it will only further affirm Helton’s decision to grant him the starting role. The verdict: USC will play its biggest season opener this Saturday.
Hype-wise, it is safe to say the promotion and build up behind Saturday’s contest has been the loudest of any USC openers in recent history.
From a national perspective, spectators will expect this contest to be a case of Alabama flexing its muscles all over a USC team that is coming off of a heartbreaking loss to Wisconsin in the Holiday Bowl in 2015 and has a new head coach and quarterback. This game has been projected by many as nothing more than an early season tune-up for the Tide against a ranked opponent. 
However, from the USC perspective, so much could ride on this contest with a victory. While a season-opening loss to the reigning national champions would not alter the college football world, a victory over Alabama would launch USC to the front lines of national title discussion.

The Trojans take part in an exciting opening weekend of college football as they take on the defending national champion and No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide. Though there are some questions on the defensive line for the No. 20 Trojans, the offense is expected to be a thrill to watch.
Quarterback
Former Gatorade High School Player of the Year, redshirt junior Max Browne, leads the Trojan offense this year after receiving the nod to secure the starting quarterback position just over a week ago. Though Browne has minimal experience playing during the season, many, including teammates and coaches, have confidence that Browne can lead them to a more favorable season than last year. Browne is not only more mobile than his predecessor Cody Kessler, but has the ability to throw the ball deep down the field, something both Browne and the receiving core will look to exploit against the Alabama secondary. 
Wide Receivers
Junior JuJu Smith-Schuster had a phenomenal season last year with 89 catches for a team-best 1,454 yards despite not being completely healthy. Smith-Schuster broke his hand against Cal, had surgery two days later and then completed the entire rest of the season. He is considered to be a legitimate contender for the Biletnikoff Award this season. 
With the national spotlight on the preseason All-American candidate, it will be the responsibility of the other receivers to step up and contribute to the offense. Senior Darreus Rogers and redshirt junior Steven Mitchell Jr. must step into their roles as leaders this season. 
Mitchell averaged 9.1 yards per catch last season but needs to expand his ability to be a threat down the field and force the defense to play honest. 
Rogers has talent and great hands as a receiver who averaged 10.3 yards per catch last season but needs to take advantage of the single coverage Smith-Schuster’s presence on the field creates. If Rogers can step up on third down through plays he has shown capable of making, USC will be substantially more effective, especially in the red-zone. 
Offensive Line
Last season the Trojan offensive line was considered suspect, though it was an injury-plagued year. Regardless of reasoning, last season the offensive line allowed 38 total sacks — one of the highest in the country. This season, with so many players earning valuable experience last season, the offensive line is expected to be one of the most talented in the country.
At Friday’s press conference, Helton quickly pointed to the offensive line when asked what advantages the Trojans have going into the season, 
“Three junior guards and three backups being juniors — it just feels like a lot of experience on the offensive line.”
Ball Carriers
The improvement on the offensive line will benefit an already talented backfield composed of senior tailback Justin Davis and sophomore tailback Ronald Jones II. Last season the Trojans rushed an average of 168 yards per game and look to increase the number exponentially this season. With improvements to the offensive line and experience and health on Davis and Jones’ side, they will look to test the talented Alabama defensive front.
The Trojans are a 10-point underdog going into the game. However, they have a chance to truly compete if the offense plays to the level they are able to. The game kicks off at 5:00 p.m. PST Saturday on ABC at AT&T Stadium in Dallas.

As a cinema and media studies student at the School of Cinematic Arts, I’ve had the amazing opportunity to dissect film and television under specific critical lenses I would’ve never thought to use had I not been here. Classes taught on 1960s culture as portrayed, have all effectively given me a broad scope to look at media and entertainment for the last three years. Writing this column has also helped broaden my view point and taught me how to examine the industry more closely than I would have ever imagined.
However, despite my knowledge and enduring interest for women in film, I never took a gender studies class until this semester. I decided to enroll in Professor Keeling’s Gender, Sexuality and Media class taught at SCA. Even though we’re only two weeks into the year, I already feel my perception and (mis)conceptions changing, as we’ve already had to discuss Beyoncé’s multi-faceted visual album Lemonade and confronted the unfortunate facts behind female directors in television through a short documentary by Bloomberg.
In the documentary, a number of female directors described the appalling state of women in television, with just 14 percent of women directing television from 2009 to 2014.  At the end of the documentary, female action director Lexi Alexander, known for being the first woman to direct a superhero movie, directed a movie that also happened to be the worst-performing Marvel movie to date. Because of poor box-office results, Alexander argued that she was black-listed in the film industry and now struggles to find work. Because of the film’s low box-office results, Alexander believed she was denied a chance to redeem herself as a filmmaker because of her gender, something that men in the film industry do not struggle with. In her closing statement, Alexander revealed that had she a chance to go back and do it all over again, she would’ve never entered the film industry at all. This wasn’t the most heartening of final remarks to say the least.
When I first arrived at the University three years ago, I did not know that Women of Cinematic Arts was an organization that existed on campus. However, during my sophomore year, I desperately attempted to attend their meetings. Even though USC’s film school has almost equal representation among males and females, many of us were told early on that the film industry is going to be much harder for individuals with two X chromosomes. Despite my well-intentioned efforts, I never attended a Woman of Cinematic Arts meeting due to night classes and a packed schedule. 
Now, in my senior year, I have no excuse. As my awareness for gender discrimination within the film industry increases, it feels more important than ever to become involved in championing equality across all spectrums. 
This past year, Women of Cinematic Arts launched an entirely new website replete with interviews from female alumna and resources on involvement and help within the industry. Additionally, they also announced a new festival that will take place throughout the fall and spring that specifically focuses on feminist media and women in the industry. 
At the Feminist Media Festival, board members of the organization will host a variety of events throughout the year to supplement what is already being offered at the School of Cinematic Arts. There will be an opening ceremony on Sept. 15 and a special award ceremony in early April for media submissions. With workshops to help students learn about the importance of female representation in both the media and industry, the Feminist Media Festival aims to showcase the benefits of even gender representation. 
Throughout the year, participants may also submit a short film or media project that meets certain expectations of the Feminist Media Festival — teams must be half female, the characters/story must pass the Bechdel test and actors must not be paid. 
With the newly created festival, it’s difficult not to believe that there is growth and possibility out there for women, despite what the numbers say. I have to believe, as a woman, with more exposure there will be more opportunities for change. For now, I will dedicate my time toward being an active member of WCA while also producing a short film with female representation in mind.

Shawn Halim, a recent USC graduate, is taking the music industry by storm with his talent. Halim studied at the Thornton School of Music as a popular music major with an emphasis on keyboards. Whether it’s producing, writing or performing, Halim has done it all and with enthusiasm and humility. The musician has worked with a wide range of artists including Michael Alvarado and Carissa Rae from Us the Duo and has made a guest appearance as a keyboardist on FOX’s Glee. 
The Daily Trojan sat down with Halim to discuss his musical inspiration and upcoming show at 626 Night Market this Friday night at the Santa Anita Race Track. 
Daily Trojan: What can visitors get out of 626 Night Market? What kind of activities and attractions are there besides performances?
Shawn Halim: The 626 Night Market is the largest Asian-themed night market in the U.S. Besides really good music, there’s also hundreds of vendors for amazing food, merchandise, arts/crafts and games for a full weekend of festivities. I also hear rumors of sushi donuts this weekend.
DT: What music will you be performing? Any new songs?
SH: I’ll be performing a mix of covers and originals. There will definitely be a few new songs being played. You’ll just have to come and watch to find out.
DT: Who would you say are your greatest musical influences?
SH: Probably my greatest musical influence would be Switchfoot. They inspired me to do music in middle school and they’re still one of my favorite bands. Their songwriting is amazing. As of right now, I’m influenced a lot by Jack Garratt, dvsn, Gallant.
DT: You play multiple instruments like piano, guitar and bass. Which instrument do you connect with the most, and which do you use mainly to write your music?
SH: Oh man, that’s a hard question! My favorite instrument is actually the cello. It just sounds so pretty. I usually write my music on piano and guitar. I try to find musical lines and then write my lyrics and melody around that.
DT: How has attending USC helped shape you into the artist you are, and how has it assisted with your career?
SH: USC equipped me so well for the music industry. I improved a lot of my technical skills as a keyboardist, learned a lot about producing and engineering music and definitely increased my knowledge on the music business side.
DT: What kind of projects are you currently working on?
SH: Currently, I’m building a studio in Arcadia. It’s a crazy project, but we have a venue and all the equipment, so we’re piecing it all together. After that, I’m hoping to record a lot of my original material.
DT: Where do you hope to see yourself in 10 years?
SH: In 10 years, I really want to be playing music with a few different bands but also produce and engineer music for upcoming artists.

Upon entering Guillermo del Toro: At Home with Monsters at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, visitors are led through an incredible experience detailing director Guillermo Del Toro’s creative process, inspiration and a look inside his personal notebooks and life. The exhibit takes visitors on a journey of Del Toro’s life through eight different thematic sections.
Del Toro’s childhood is revisited in the opening section, “Childhood and Innocence.” In this section, children are the focal point, as in many of his films, through their own perceptions of reality. The children in his works are described as having unfiltered emotions and expressions. It’s vital to understand del Toro’s unsentimental nature toward people — and children are no exception. More so, this lack of sentiment is demonstrated in his non-shielding of young characters from harm, abandonment, fear or death. The collection confirms this narrative by displaying pictures of dead children as well as a quote from Del Toro. “In fairy tales ogres and wolves ate children, and I think that it goes to the roots of storytelling, to have children as vulnerable.” 
The collection under “Victoriana” illuminates the creativity del Toro uses in a majority of his work, namely, that of the earlier Romantic era and later Edwardian age. This inspiration even stems back to Victorian writer Charles Dickens’ influence on the name of del Toro’s residence, Bleak House. During the Victorian period, science was embraced and used meticulously to categorize all aspects of life. The collection reflects this modern embrace in the form of del Toro’s extensive collection of insect paraphernalia, including images of specimens and diverse trinkets.
“Magic, Alchemy, and The Occult” is the third section of Guillermo del Toro’s grand exhibit. This section is embellished with compositions and statues paying homage to the beauty of horror. Notable works included paintings by Pieter van der Heyden, Zdzisław Beksinski as well as some statues of H.P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft’s invoking monstrous madness is cited as a staple to del Toro’s influences.
A section that can be surprising to the casual observer is “Movies, Comics, Pop Culture.” This particular section shows viewers del Toro’s love for comic books. Famous Monsters of Filmland was among Del Toro’s favorite films, so much so he claims to have learned English in order to decipher and make sense of the puns in the series. Concept art of films such as Sleeping Beauty created by Earle Eyvind contributed to the eccentric collection. 
“Frankenstein and Horror” pays homage to one of del Toro’s first stories heard as a child. Del Toro later read Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus which solidified the effect Frankenstein’s monster had on him. The frailty and vulnerability of the monster is something implemented in many of del Toro’s creations. Frankenstein allowed Del Toro to effectively connect to the horror genre and champion it. 
“I adore it. I embrace it. I enshrine it. I don’t look down upon it or frown up it in a way that a lot of directors do … For me, it’s not a steppingstone, it’s a cathedral,” del Toro said.
The special exhibit ended with “Death and the Afterlife.”  Context is given regarding Del Toro’s upbringing in Guadalajara, Mexico, in a strict Catholic household. His grandmother instilled the notion of original sin and submitted him to exorcisms to eradicate his love of monsters and fantasy, which only led him further from the religion.
In many of his films, del Toro spins traditional views of loss, innocence, or ego and transforms them into hope and redemption. Many of his characters find purpose in community, especially the environments around them.
After experiencing del Toro’s exhibit, visitors walk away with a greater understanding of the eclectic director’s inspirations through the various sections. The imagery seen in both del Toro’s concept art as well as collections that have inspired him will also create a large sense of captivation and curiosity. 
Guillermo Del Toro: At Home with Monsters will appear at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art until Nov. 27th.

It is in no way reaching to call the 2016 United States presidential election a joke, a media frenzy desperately clinging to the latest asinine comment made by Republican candidate Donald Trump.
 His most recent display of unbridled nonsense is the wild accusation that Democratic presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton is somehow a bigot. The BBC reported last Thursday that during a Mississippi rally, Trump claimed Clinton “sees people of color only as votes — not as human beings worthy of a better future.” He expressed similar statements in a Dimondale, Michigan, speech the week prior.
 If ever there was a situation of the pot calling the kettle black, this would be it.
Trump is a showman, evident by his fairly impressive IMDB page and multiple media appearances prior to his bid for the White House. His past financial support of Clinton and slew of comically outrageous remarks raise the nagging question of whether Trump actually believes anything he says about race, religion or immigration. First and foremost a businessman, Trump is shrewd and calculating, feeding off  increasing fear to make his bid seem like the answer to the prayers of his xenophobic base. 
According to a December 2015 Washington Post analysis, a large chunk of Trump’s supporters are poor, uneducated conservative white males. By counteracting an ever-growing liberal mainstream and voicing what his supporters are thinking, Trump has painted a false image of himself as a blunt, honest anti-establishment candidate who only speaks his mind without worrying about political correctness. It is disheartening to imagine he was serious when he said that he would consider having Muslims register in a government database and carry around special identification, reminiscent of laws requiring Jews to do the same in Nazi Germany 
 If this is, indeed, Trump’s plan, then he is a Machiavellian, evil genius. If this is not his true motive, however, then perhaps we face the even more devastating reality that Americans allowed a bigoted racist to get within inches of the White House.
 In either case, calling Clinton a bigot is both hypocritical and unfair, particularly since it seems Trump’s entire campaign runs on dogmatism and intolerance. Like the ringleader of a mob riot, the “Make America Great Again” candidate fuels the dangerous animosity and jaundiced attitude many of his supporters have toward people who do not fit the “White America” mold.
 In a  Salon piece entitled “Anatomy of a Trump Voter: How Racism Propelled Trump to the Republican Nomination,” writer Sean McElwee points out that Trump’s supporters “buy into the politics of resentment” and “endorse racial resentment and stereotypes.” McElwee found that the probability of Trump support reached a staggering 80 percent at the highest level of anti-black stereotyping. For Muslims and Hispanics, the probability of support rose “more than 70 percent.” Essentially, the more prejudice a voter is, the more likely they are to put in their ballots for Trump. 
 If the Republican nominee is going to call Clinton a bigot, he should first ask himself why so many of his supporters harbor such racial resentment. Perhaps because they see themselves in him.
 There is no denying that Clinton is trying to acquire support from black voters, but she does not fuel racist sentiment to do so. According to a February NPR piece, Clinton won the South Carolina primary with support from 80 percent of black voters. 
Clinton organized a strike after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination and led efforts to recruit more black students, according to a 2007 New York Times piece by Mark Leibovich. Meanwhile, within the same decade, Trump was sued by the Justice Department in a 1973 civil rights case for violating the Fair Housing Act and discriminating against potential black tenants.
 It is hard to imagine anybody taking anything Trump says seriously, yet the unfortunate and very serious reality remains that a great deal of his supporters hang onto his every word, while non-white populations are left feeling attacked and more marginalized than ever in a country in which they are supposed to feel safe. 
His Mississippi and Michigan speeches are guilty of the exact same charge he has hurled toward Clinton: trying to acquire black votes without really caring about the issues that matter to them. He dares to ask black voters: “What do you have to lose by trying something new?” Clinton is not the perfect candidate either, but at least she is not “taking a hate movement mainstream,” as the Democratic nominee herself rebuked. 
 It is sad that, in the year 2016, this type of candidate has managed to gain ground in a United States presidential race and become the Republican nominee. Even so, many Republicans themselves cannot stand behind him, feeling he is an inaccurate representation of their ideals. 
If Mr. Trump is so keen on walls, then perhaps he should work on tearing them down — not adding to the existing ones we already have.

Emilie Skoog | Daily Trojan
It’s often difficult for a student voice to be heard in the political arena, especially amid big-money interests and corporate pressure. But students at University of Texas, Austin are not the type to give up. Thousands brought shiny, colorful dildos to their first day of class, protesting concealed carry on campus by pointing out that an innocuous, yet risque image like a sexual toy is not permitted on campus, yet a deadly weapon is. The symbolic gesture originated as a response to the recent Texas law that permits anyone with a permit to carry concealed weapons on college campuses. The law was created to ensure that the students would be able to defend themselves in case of mass shootings, such as the 2015 Umpqua Community College or the 2013 Santa Monica College shootings.
History has shown that guns on college campuses, or anywhere for that matter, have been shown to seldom protect and more often serve as death agents for destabilized, stressed, or psychologically damaged students. The decision lasts a split second and can do a lot of damage before anyone can even react. In a situation like this — especially a planned attack — it’s ridiculous to expect civilians to shoot back.
 The piece of legislation has been so controversial that three faculty members at UT Austin have filed a lawsuit on the basis that having concealed weapons in their classrooms would impede the free exchange of controversial ideas and thus interfere with the First Amendment right to  academic freedom. Federal judge Lee Yeakel rejected the argument on the basis that concealed weapons do not directly prevent students from voicing one side of an issue or another. 
 Yeakel’s basis of rejecting the lawsuit was his interpretation that the right to academic freedom is not an absolute right.
 However, the presence of concealed weapons on campus has much greater stakes in terms of safety. Students — and professors, for that matter — must be able to speak freely without being afraid of some overly-passionate peer pulling out a gun. The concealed nature of the weapons would also rob students of an awareness of danger that could potentially save their lives. Academic freedom, especially when tied to student safety,  must be upheld.
 The judge also pointed out that concealed weapons do not force students to lean one way or another on different issues. But this argument is purely tunnel-vision. While it might be true that hidden guns do not directly sway opinions, the fear of being shot during a controversial discussion may prevent both students and teachers from expressing honest opinions. Professors should not fear for their lives in discussions of failing grades. The concealed nature of the weapons makes the threat even more unpredictable. It is in this way that the ruling indirectly impacts free speech, endangering lives in the process.
 The UT Austin protest is only one of the first signs of discomfort on campus. The former dean of UT Austin School of Architecture left for University of Pennsylvania because of his opposition to the new gun law. Less than a month has passed since the law and already the waves it caused are turning into tsunamis.
 If thousands of students and professors do not feel safe being on campus, then the law quite directly impacts their freedom to learn in a healthy, protected environment. If their voices are not heard soon, this law could set a precedent for other college campuses around the country, encouraging trigger-happy politicians to implement such policies elsewhere. More conservative pro-gun states might follow Texas’s lead.
 Some would argue that the more students that have concealed weapons, the more the chance of a shooter being stopped by one of them. In both theory and practice, this argument reveals itself to be completely fallacious. To expect an untrained civilian with a concealed, safety-locked weapon only theoretically within arm’s reach to suddenly, effectively and efficiently take down a shooter with an automatic weapon is heinous.  A study by the Federal Bureau of Investigation examined active-shooter events from 2000 to 2012 and determined that less than 3 percent were stopped by armed civilians.  Other research is inconclusive, and more data must be gathered. A college campus is not the place for that experiment.
 While more guns may seem like the solution to rampant mass shootings in schools across the country, having weapons at an arm’s length is too much of a risk to take. Fighting fire with fire will only magnify the already blazing inferno. 
CCH should be CCW,  for concealed carry weapon.  I hate autocorrect. 
Using the CCH issue as a blockage to students and faculty being afraid to voice their opinions in a heated or objective discussion is ludicrous. That’s a cry baby, safe zone mentality that must end. The difference in the dido protest and the CCH issue is that folks who are trained and certified to carry do not flaunt the fact that they have a gun w them. The dido protest was juvenile and doesn’t even come close to making the point other than the making fools of themselves for waving it around.  CCW is like martial arts.  Folks who are trained and respect the weapon never let you know they have a gun in their possession or can kill you with one hand movement.
“[F]olks who are trained and certified to carry” you say?
Training days required for a Pastry Chef : 96
For Ringling Bros. / B&B Clown College : 48
For Professional Dog Walker certificate : 4
For french fry station at McDonald’s : 3
For Texas Handgun Permit : 1
Do we really want someone with 2% as much training as a clown has, packing a deadly weapon?
If you absolutely don’t like guns no matter the terms or conditions, then just say that.  Stop guessing.

Suspended sophomore inside linebacker Osa Masina is under two investigations for separate alleged sexual assault incidents, according to police.
Cottonwood Heights police in Utah confirmed to FOX 13 on Tuesday that Masina is being investigated for an alleged sexual assault that took place this summer in Salt Lake County, though no charges were filed.
According to the report, the Los Angeles Police Department assisted the Cottonwood Heights Police Department in serving a search warrant at a practice facility at USC last week.
In a statement, a USC spokesperson said the school was aware of the investigation involving Masina.
“USC is cooperating fully with authorities in Utah, the lead agency in the investigation,” the statement read. “Due to privacy laws and to protect the rights of our students, we are not able to discuss this matter further.”
Police Sgt. Dan Bartlett told ESPN that the Los Angeles Police Department also has an active investigation into Masina for an incident which he said occurred before the one in Utah. Masina’s attorney, Greg Skordas, confirmed to ESPN that there are two ongoing investigations.
On Monday, head coach Clay Helton announced in his weekly Trojans Live appearance that Masina will not travel with the football team to Arlington, Texas, for the season’s first game against Alabama on Saturday,
Helton said Masina violated team rules, but did not disclose any details. He did speak on the matter following practice on Tuesday, deferring to the University.
“Really as a coach you’re taken out of it,” he said. “This is a university matter and a university policy and I’m confident in the guidance of the university here. They’ll let me know.”
Redshirt junior Max Browne, recently named the starting quarterback, said the incident was “tough.”
“At the end of the day we’ve had some distractions in the past and I’ll leave that to Coach Helton to address,” he said.
Masina, a 6-foot-4, 230-pound sophomore, is listed as a backup inside linebacker on the depth chart behind senior Michael Hutchings.
A five-star recruit out of high school, Masina was a backup inside linebacker his freshman year, appearing in 12 games. He made 25 tackles and a fumble recovery that he returned for a touchdown.
Masina will join sophomore cornerback Isaiah Langley as the two USC players suspended for the first game. Langley was suspended following an arrest in May at a UCLA fraternity party.
The last USC football player to be accused of sexual assault was Bryce Dixon, who was expelled in May of last year but later allowed to re-enroll in school after a judge stayed the expulsion, though Dixon was not allowed to re-join the team.
At least one teammate expressed sympathy for Masina.
“You know, he’s my brother and I’m going to support him,” said sophomore running back Ronald Jones II.
