As my friend and I were walking home after USC men’s basketball suffered a 78-57 defeat to No. 20 Colorado Saturday night, we struck up a conversation with a fellow student who obviously knows college basketball. Even after a blowout home loss to a conference rival, this student was still upbeat about the Trojans’ chances to make something of this season. 
It was hard to agree after the performance I had just witnessed, but he made some good points. He argued that USC’s strong record — in and out of conference — as well as the fact that all the team’s losses have come against quality opponents still had it poised for its first NCAA Tournament since 2017. 
The Trojans are 17-5 with a 6-3 conference record, and the way he saw it, an identical 6-3 mark in the team’s final nine games is both plausible and sufficient to make March Madness. They’re still second in the Pac-12, and maintaining their current level of play would likely land them a first-round bye for the conference tournament, a helpful boost for their chances of winning the event and an automatic bid to the Big Dance.
I’m still not as optimistic as this bastion of college basketball knowledge, but he somehow convinced me that a 21-point home loss wasn’t a total catastrophe. 
Let’s start with the schedule. USC has three games left that stick out as particularly tough: two against Arizona and its talented cast of freshmen and a rematch with the Buffaloes in Boulder. If the Trojans can manage a victory in that home game against the Wildcats, they’ll be in good shape.
That’s because the rest of their opponents aren’t exactly a murderer’s row. USC has a home-and-home against Arizona State, which sits at 13-8 and the picture of mediocrity with a 4-4 conference record. There’s a road matchup with Utah, which did push the Trojans at home earlier last week but don’t have the talent to consistently match up with USC. The Trojans also host Washington State, which sports a 1-5 road record on the season, and UCLA, who USC dispatched easily at Pauley Pavilion a few weeks ago. That sounds like five wins.
That leaves Washington, who clobbered USC 72-40 in early January in Seattle. But many things are different now from then, namely that Huskies sophomore guard Quade Green was ruled academically ineligible and suspended for the season following Washington’s bludgeoning of USC. The Huskies have gone 1-7 in Green’s absence and fallen to last place in the conference. Does that sound like a team that’s likely to come into Galen Center and take it to the Trojans?
That’s the thing about this USC group — it only loses to good teams. The Trojans were never going to beat Oregon or Washington on the road. The blowout losses to Colorado and Marquette were discouraging, but Colorado couldn’t seem to miss Saturday while Marquette senior guard Markus Howard unsurprisingly outclassed the Trojans en route to  51 points. That’s a big number in the college game, but Howard is one of the best players in the country, leading the NCAA with 27.9 points per game. The performance by the Trojans was bad, but did you expect them to lock Howard up or something?
There are two positives to this outlook on the team. One, you can expect the Trojans to win most of their remaining games and a round or two in Vegas because of the poor competition. Two, they’ll have plenty of tape on and experience with the conference’s heavyweights come the later rounds of the Pac-12 Tournament. 
The cool thing about this college basketball season is that there is no dominant team. That’s especially true of the Pac-12, where the schools are always beating up on each other and any squad that seems to emerge as the favorite always seems to get taken down a peg by a team everyone had written off. USC isn’t the best team in the conference, but if it can get a bye and limit its tournament matchups with the conference’s best teams, anything can happen for a few games in a diluted conference.
I’m not here to convince you that it’s all sunshine and rainbows for this team. The fact that two of its best three players are non-shooting bigs has caused serious spacing issues that have sunk the offense for most of the last two games. That’s been especially true in the first half, as the Trojans have forced themselves to play from behind. There have been times that they were able to recover, but I hope that ass-kicking the Buffaloes handed them taught them that’s not the best approach and kicks them into gear.
The Trojans have flashed brilliance at times this season, from the 20-point comeback against Stanford to the effort at Oregon that nearly netted USC a top-tier victory. But they’ve been maddeningly inconsistent, as they should be. Their best player, forward Onyeka Okongwu, is a freshman, and so is starting point guard Ethan Anderson. More youngsters, sophomore guard Elijah Weaver and freshman forward Isaiah Mobley, play big roles off the bench. 
Young teams are prone to making mistakes and putting up duds, so that must be understood. But this group’s ceiling is higher than it has been in years, so I implore you to keep an open mind about it. Yes, the Trojans are much more likely to collapse as the regular season closes, get bounced in the opening round in Vegas and miss the Tournament than they are to go on a fairy tale run to the Final 4, but I promise you that’s not all that matters. Sometimes it’s just fun to watch some talented guys play basketball, mistakes and all.
To those who got too excited over USC’s success and are now sounding the doomsday alarm, I have two pieces of advice: Calm down, and keep watching. I think you’ll be glad you did.

The USC men’s and women’s tennis teams each continued their hot starts this season with dominant wins this past weekend at their respective dual-match tournaments.
The No. 3 men’s team traveled to the Bay Area to take on No. 11 Stanford and No. 15 California. Led by senior captain Brandon Holt, USC cruised past the Cardinal with a 6-1 victory to capture its first road win of the season. 
Following Friday’s impressive performance, the Trojans secured a 4-1 victory against the Bears Saturday in Berkeley.
USC brought along all its players from its previous tournament along with Holt for the road tests at Stanford and Cal. Head coach Brett Masi said the early experience playing on the road will be beneficial for the team later on this season.
“We’re going to face some adversity playing at different environments,” Masi said. “We played two top 15 teams this weekend … We got some heavy competition in before going off on the road again next weekend to [face an] even more adverse environment.” 
The Trojans notched their first point Friday in Palo Alto with the doubles pair of sophomore Mor Bulis and Holt. The two secured a 6-4 win over Stanford’s pair of junior Timothy Sah and sophomore Sangeet Sridhar to get USC on the board.
The Cardinal struck back to tie the score during the first singles action but freshman Ryder Jackson responded to give USC the go-ahead lead with a fast 6-3, 6-2 win on court six. 
The momentum continued into the Trojans’ next two matches, as Bulis and Holt finished things off to secure the win. USC tallied another two wins to make the final score 6-1 at the end of the first day.
USC continued its dominant performance at Berkeley Saturday, starting with a quick 3-0 advantage over the Bears. Cal got on the board with a singles win before freshman Stefan Dostanic clinched the victory for USC in a three-set victory. 
Masi praised the freshman after the match.
“Stefan had a rough match yesterday against Stanford and he lost,” Masi said. “We told him to get ready for today’s match … He had a good attitude and the match came down to him and he showed he was ready.” 
On the women’s side, No. 19 USC played Saint Mary’s in its home opener Friday at Marks Stadium, sweeping the Gaels 4-0 to start off the day.
Saturday’s matches featured a doubleheader for the women’s team against UC Santa Barbara and Long Beach State. The first doubles point went to the Gauchos when sophomores Danielle Willson and Estella Jaeger were dealt a loss. After senior Angela Kulikov and sophomore Salma Ewing each recorded two-set victories over UCSB, the Trojans tied the score 2-2. USC eventually triumphed over UCSB to secure its first victory of the day.
The Trojans carried that momentum into their next match against Long Beach State. USC took an early 1-0 lead with a doubles victory before freshman Eryn Cayetano and Willson captured respective two-set wins over their opponents to give USC a 3-0 overall advantage. 
The Trojans closed out the day with a 4-1 win over Long Beach State after competing for a total of six hours. 
Next up, the USC men’s team will travel to Columbus to take on Ohio State Sunday while the women will head to Chicago to compete in the ITA National Indoor Championship Feb. 7-10.

In what might have been its most important game of the season to this point, the USC men’s basketball team came up  short Saturday night of No. 20 Colorado, losing 78-57 at Galen Center.  
The Trojans knew they were playing for sole possession of first place in the Pac-12 after conference No. 1 Oregon lost earlier in the day to Stanford. 
But the stakes were similarly high for Colorado as well. With a conference record of 5-3, the Buffaloes had an opportunity to tie the Trojans for second place in the Pac-12 with a win.
Whereas Colorado played like a team that had plenty riding on Saturday’s matchup, USC faltered and could not keep up with the Buffaloes’ high powered offense. 
At one point in the game, Colorado had a 27-point lead, an unprecedented deficit for USC this season.
“[We] played fairly hard, we just didn’t play well,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said. “Give Colorado credit … Some of the guys who aren’t even shooters really hurt us.”
Shooting proved to be the biggest difference in the game. The Buffaloes shot 51.9% from the field while the Trojans shot only 37.9%, one of their worst shooting performances of the season. 
Momentum was also a key part of the Buffaloes’ success. After USC’s last two home games saw the Trojans erase a 20-point halftime deficit against Stanford and come back late against Utah, Colorado quickly put to rest any hope of another stunning comeback with a 13-0 run to start the second half.
“We had a lot of chances early and throughout the game to make layups, make post moves, make threes, and we just didn’t get it done,” Enfield said. “So we’ll have to figure out how to improve our offense and go from there.”
Colorado forced 11 turnovers and capitalized by turning them into 15 points. The Buffaloes kept the Trojans on their toes all game long by not allowing easy shots. It was a tough night all around for the Trojans, who fell victim to eight steals and four blocks by the Buffaloes.
Junior guard Tyler Bey led Colorado with team highs of 16 points and seven rebounds. 
USC senior guard Jonah Mathews and freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu led the way in scoring for the Trojans with 11 points each. Okongwu also pulled down 10 rebounds on his way to yet another double-double this season but struggled overall from the field, shooting just 3-of-8 with a number of misses deep in the paint. Fellow freshman forward Isaiah Mobley scored 12 points off the bench.
“I think our energy dropped off,” Mobley said. “I picked up two quick fouls, and normally that’s one of my jobs as a sixth man, seventh man to come in and bring energy, and I think we as a team — we just took a dip.”
The Trojans will hope to move past the tough loss and regroup in the second half of the conference schedule. With an overall record of 17-5 and conference record of 6-3, USC can still earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament, which has alluded the Trojans since 2017. 
USC will travel to Arizona next to take on Arizona and Arizona State. The Trojans will first travel to Tucson to match up with the Wildcats, who currently stand at 5-3 in the Pac-12. The two teams will tip off Thursday at 6 p.m. before a 7 p.m. Saturday matchup with the Sun Devils.

Ideas are not hard to find — the real challenge is to find someone who will turn those ideas into something real.
That’s exactly what Brynn McIntosh did. The senior majoring in media arts and practice with a concentration in film production was able to expand her various interests into complementary forms of art — and at a young age, was able to create a successful business out of it. 
Her exclusive streetwear clothing brand 10.25 gets its name from McIntosh’s birthday and offers mainly graphic pieces, including hoodies and sweatpants. It is a reflection of her personality, as Brynn, a childhood “sneakerhead,’’ considers simplicity and comfort her priorities. Still, it says a lot about Brynn’s beliefs and causes, and all the repercussions associated with it. 
“I can’t really control who’s gonna find my work as educational or offensive,” McIntosh said. “All I do is share my perspective and my voice in terms of race and class and whatever I feel like I’m representing.” 
McIntosh’s journey began at an early age, long before she moved to Los Angeles, and in a somewhat unexpected place: cartoons. The simplicity and timelessness of cartoons such as SpongeBob became an essential part of the designer’s own style. 
“L.A. has definitely inspired the streetwear aspect, but I think the simple design is always the inspiration for my cartoons. It has always been there,” McIntosh said. 
Still, she recognizes that the city has also inspired her artistic view and served as a catalyst for her brand. 
“There are so many different hustles within L.A., so it was definitely inspiring,” McIntosh said. “And then I was like, ‘You know what? I want to have something of my own.’” 
After seeing a friend from high school launch his own clothing line, McIntosh decided it was time for her to take the first step, so she created the logo for her brand — still present on her designs — and her dream started to become a reality not just an idea. 
However, the turning point was during the summer of her junior year at USC, when her brother, Alec, suggested she print her design on a shirt at a market on Melrose Avenue. 
“Just seeing it right there, it was so simple,” McIntosh said. “It took this guy five minutes, it wasn’t scary … No one else had it, it’s my own thing, [the only] one in its existence.’’ 
With that first leap of courage and support from her brother, 10.25 came to life.  
“I would say my brother was the launching pad for me, because I still wanted to put this stuff out but I was too scared, so he was a really nice support system for me,” McIntosh said. “He was just like, ‘Yeah, lets just put your design up there,” and I was like, ‘Wow, what?’’’
Having passed this initial phase, McIntosh established 10.25. 
“I am already working on getting my own tags [and] my own shopping bags … I have my own packaging now,” McIntosh said. “Very small steps, but, the next thing you know, you are fully in the business.”
Managing a rigorous curriculum in parallel with a growing business, the aspiring designer used her major as a basis for her job. 
“My major has definitely helped me just open all artistic aspects of myself, even though not every single class is related to my brand,’’ McIntosh said. 
One class that stood out to her was “Originating and Developing Ideas for Film,” in which she learned how to surface her creativity. 
“It’s almost like exercising your mind,’’ McIntosh said.  
Mcintosh is definitely a one-woman show, but she still considers support to be a major pillar of her success.
“USC has helped me meet a lot of important people [and form] great friendships but also great connections,” McIntosh said. 
And for McIntosh, sometimes all of those overlap — and great friendships end up being great connections.  McIntosh’s friendship with Rahzizi Ishakarah, a senior majoring in art and design with a concentration in entrepreneurship, is one such example. 
Like McIntosh, Ishakarah’s field of work is broad, but now his primary focus is on his clothing brand “Blex,’’ short for “Black Excellence’’ and which revolves around trying to defy expectations and show minorities in a positive light. With experience in various areas ranging from graphic design to business management, Ishakarah is an important support system for McIntosh both emotionally and technically. 
The same can be said of another friend of the artist’s, Marshall Spellmeyer, a senior majoring in communication. Spellmeyer also works in the field of design as one of the media creators and graphic designers for the USC football department.
“We’ve been really good friends and we’ve always given each other advice and motivated [and] inspired each other through conversations about life and [working] to be better in our different fields,” Spellmeyer said. “We like to push each other as well.”
Surrounded by support from family and friends and a supportive curriculum, McIntosh has already come far, but she isn’t carried away by that. 
“I’m just trying to think about the present,” McIntosh said. “[I] don’t think about if the brand’s gonna be successful, [I] don’t think about if the brand’s gonna be this or [that]. I try to keep ‘if’ out of my vocabulary and start speaking into now. Here is what has to be done right now, so that’s just something I’ve been telling myself every day.” 
And for those unsure about taking their ideas to the next level, McIntosh encourages them to just go ahead and do it. 
“Stop being scared, or at least be less scared,” McIntosh said. “Just close your eyes and jump into it. Whatever it is that you want to do, I promise you, you won’t regret it.”

You know that meme of Steve Buscemi in “30 Rock,” wearing a hoodie and brandishing a skateboard, awkwardly approaching a group of high schoolers and saying, “How do you do fellow kids?” Yeah. That’s how the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences looks with this year’s nominees for Best Picture.
In a column for The New Yorker, film critic Richard Brody reminds us that the Oscars are important because they are Hollywood’s perception of itself. When a film wins Best Picture, it’s not just anyone saying “This is the best movie of the year,” but rather Hollywood itself saying, “This is the best we have to offer.” And, since movies have been associated with Hollywood almost since their conception about 100 years ago, the Academy’s Best Picture pretends to crown the best that the entire industry had to offer that year. 
While we ought to pay attention to what Hollywood thinks of itself, I believe that’s where our respect for the Academy Awards should end. For Best Picture is rarely what everyone (read: my Twitter feed) thinks is actually the best picture. How do you even determine that? It’s already dangerous to put qualifiers like “best” on art. All the Academy does is provide its opinion — just like you or I might do every year with our friends. 
The Academy is a collective, and collective consensus is hard. In its endless pursuit to find a definition for “best,” the Academy consistently resorts to what their predecessors have awarded. Hence, the rise of  “Oscar bait” — movies that are so obviously pandering to the Academy through characters, settings and tropes that they are actually bad instead of “best.” These are proof that the tropes the Academy likes don’t automatically make for a good picture. Ultimately, the Best Picture award says more about the Academy than it does about the state of the art.
Fueled by a growing anxiety to make the Academy Awards relevant to a declining viewership, recent efforts to define “best” have led the Academy to nominate popular movies — deeming box office numbers signs of quality. Blockbusters like “Get Out” and “Black Panther” were nominated in previous years; in these cases, popularity did mean a general consensus of quality. But, then again, “Bohemian Rhapsody” was likely nominated on the basis of profit too. 
“Moonlight” unexpectedly took Best Picture in 2017, paving the way for indie and foreign darlings “Lady Bird,” “Call Me by Your Name,” “Roma” and “The Favourite” to be nominated in subsequent years. Some attribute this trend to the changing demographics of the Academy as older, more traditionalist members retire or pass away and a younger, more diverse class is gradually ushered in. We’ve seen the tension between the old and new members move back and forth from awarding “Moonlight” to crowning “Green Book” last year. One was a bold, complex story by and about a marginalized group, the other was a simplistic, traditional comedy presuming to have the key to solving racism. One win was unprecedented, the other was tragically expected.
This year’s nominees come from an Academy so clearly frustrated with itself and the changing industry. Different movies are made by different kinds of people, yet the Academy (like Buscemi in “30 Rock”) is changing into some new clothes but cannot escape its old, dying body.  
Despite a 25% increase in female members from 2015 to 2019, 68% of Academy voters are male. Of course, this imbalance is likely to blame for the lack of female directors nominated for Best Director, but it also means that movies like “1917” and “Ford v. Ferrari” are in the running for Best Picture. “1917” was a lock from the moment Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins struck hands to do a war picture (that image gives me goosebumps, so I don’t blame the Academy men). James Mangold’s “Ford v. Ferrari” is a traditional racing, buddy romp with a dollop of American heart (which is extremely fun when it’s handled this well), but it sort of came and went. To see it in the category was a surprise because of its lukewarm reception, but an obvious choice considering it’s still a genre movie with two big-name actors going toe-to-toe and talking about 1960s Ford carburetors and whatnot. While the film is aware of its genre and actually handles the masculinity of it all in an original way, its skeleton is that of an Old Hollywood flick, and thus catnip for at least 68% of AMPAS. 
Like “1917” and “Ford vs. Ferrari,” “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” and “The Irishman” certainly have a veneer of freshness but are ultimately exactly what the Academy looks for: Two confirmed masters of the art in career-culminating films. What’s more Tarantino than a movie about the movies? What’s more Scorsese than an epic three-hour reflection on gangster guilt? 
“Little Women” and “Marriage Story” are the opposite: Old stories revamped by new voices. While Greta Gerwig was nominated for “Lady Bird,” she was completely shut out for her exceptional work directing “Little Women.” Noah Baumbach has consistently been overlooked by the Oscars despite his long, consistent career. It’s telling then that Baumbach and Gerwig are recognized this year for two traditional genres: the divorce movie and the adaptation. Their hope for recognition was to create something original under the guise of something classic: as Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times calls the latter, “genuinely radical with a classical veneer.” 
“Jojo Rabbit,” Taika Waititi’s Third Reich satire, has come under criticism for being too shallow — it does not take the risks it is expected to. This critique, in my opinion, is vindicated by one particular moment in “Jojo Rabbit” where the titular character kicks an imaginary Hitler in the balls. It’s so hilarious and it’s almost manipulative: There can be no easier gag than the Fuhrer crippling before a 10 year old. Waititi’s film presents itself as bold and risky, but it lacks the sophistication he promises in the beginning and ultimately falls into cheap slapstick humor. You can see why the Academy — trying to be cool — digs “Jojo Rabbit,” a film, again, with the face of freshness, but depth that reaches the Oscar’s ankles.
“Joker” and “Parasite” are the two opposite poles in the Best Picture race. The former is a peculiar pastiche of multiple Scorsese films and comic book storylines, while “Parasite” is one of the most original films of the year. The reason “Parasite” seems to be more of a favorite than the Scorsese and Tarantino films is because of its unexpected triumph in the U.S. From an industry where all we get is more of the same (“You’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all”), “Parasite” has rocked the world with its real originality and relevance. Nominating box-office hit “Joker” gives the Academy some of the relevance it craves, but, again, the nominee has the semblance of being bold and new without the depth to back it up. “Joker” is so self-centered while “Parasite” is so self-aware that it straight up mocks how viewers will react to its story — “Wow … this is so metaphorical,” so aptly put by Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) in Parasite. 
Like “Green Book” last year, the Academy has nominated films that presume to be significant but are really, at a skeletal level, stories that the Academy has traditionally fawned over. Thankfully, unlike last year, no nominee is as divisive as “Green Book,” except perhaps “Joker.” The Oscars have once again reverted to their historical tastes and where previous years have nominated several indie contenders, most of these nominees are big studio films. If you want something to shake up the establishment like “Moonlight” did, “Parasite” is your only hope. 
Arguments about quality are almost irrelevant when it comes to the Oscars, for the awards are ultimately very political. When we predict who will win, it’s sadly almost never who we want to win. The Academy Awards say more about the Academy than about the films nominated and their audience. If the movie you love does not win, that’s not to say it’s bad (and vice-versa). 
What value the Oscars do have is that they can ignite important conversations about what a movie actually has to say and why Hollywood thinks this is the best it has to offer. So, regardless of the winner, once the Best Picture is announced, be wary and look closely: You may find that other pictures, though not the “best,” have more to say.

Sundance Film Festival is about beginnings. Not only are careers launched there, but a precedent is set for the new year in cinema. Sundance 2020 saw the premieres of myriad daring and relevant films. Topical movies that do not shy away from the grittier parts of life work because they expose viewers to a raw and arresting perspective of reality through a palatable art form. 
Sundance is one of the three major global film festivals and takes place in late January to early February, followed by the Cannes Film Festival and the Venice Film Festival later in the year. The running theme of Sundance 2020 seemed to be occasionally difficult to watch, always important to consume.
Safe to say, attending Sundance 2020 was, for many, nothing short of a dream come true. The general atmosphere of Park City, Utah  was full of excitement, curiosity and innovation. All around barriers were broken as new voices were heard through inspiring new modes of storytelling. 
Documentaries like Ron Howard’s “Rebuilding Paradise” and Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine’s “Boys State” (U.S. Grand Jury Prize winner in Documentary) touched on important topics like the climate crisis and the projected future of the United States government without being politically overt about their subjects and alienating audiences. The documentaries work because they bite off just the right amount of an otherwise large dish and both follow the people at the heart of it all. 
In “Rebuilding Paradise,” Ron Howard reports on the devastating Paradise wildfires that took the lives of 85 people and destroyed 19,000 buildings in 2018. Interestingly enough though, in an interview, Howard claims it is not an environmental crisis film.
The point of the work is to tell personal stories because those are what appeals to an audience’s emotions.
And that’s really what the entire medium of filmmaking is all about. “Boys State” follows an annual conference where young men build an entirely new representative government system from scratch. Every summer, more than 1,000 adolescent males belonging to a leadership group called Boys State meet in the Texas Capitol for an American Legion-sponsored conference where they split into Nationalists and Federalists. 
“Boys State’s” success can be credited to the fact that it does not try to be bigger than it is. These young men are a microcosm of the U.S.government. They are kids with their own drama, and while some of their problems are childishly petty, so are adult politics. 
The narrative features did not hold back either: Movies such as Emerald Fennell’s “Promising Young Woman” and Lee Isaac Chung’s “Minari” were also major talking points at the festival — the latter of which took home double prizes in the Dramatic category for the U.S. Grand Jury prize and the Audience award. “Promising Young Woman” is an audacious directorial debut that follows a young woman, Cassie, as she single-handedly tricks and confronts male sexual abusers. She’s a larger-than-life character, yet she resonates with the frustration and helplessness that so many women feel crushed by today. 
“Minari” gives us a new take on the American Dream. David is a 7-year-old Korean American boy whose father decides to move their family from California to Arkansas to pursue farming. The film explores changing and unchanging generational aspirations and a persistent hope for success in a foreign land that is handed down from father to son. “Minari” debuted to tears, laughter and a standing ovation from the Sundance crowd because it’s a story that resonates. While the film is uniquely Korean American and does not shy away from its deeply rooted identity in Asian American cultural assimilation, at its core it’s a story about relationships and the compromise between individual goals and the greater good of a family. 
Every screening had a Best In Festival pre-screening wrap up where each wrap focused on the biggest premieres and panels of the previous day. Notably, there was a spotlight on representation of people with disabilities in cinema. Videos and photos of conversations with the crew of “Crip Camp,” a documentary about a camp for people with disabilities run by hippies in the ’60s and ’70s, were shown, calling attention to a community of people who have been denied access to the film industry. 
Another highlight was a short video before each screening featuring a member of a Utah Native American tribe-member as a means of honoring the history of the Native land the festival takes place on. Sundance has followed through on its commitment to support indigenous artists from its very start and has launched the Native Filmmakers Lab, an organization spanning three generations that works to find and give platforms to Native American creators.
The atmosphere of Sundance was also one where networking and connection-making were airborne. But Sundance Film Festival doesn’t feel elitist. While the festival is accredited and renowned worldwide, anyone can go. People were eager to engage in conversation, whether it was about what they were seeing or how one can get connected and stay in touch for opportunities post-festival. 
But the festival didn’t feel fake, for lack of a better term. And no other place was this more obvious than the USC reception party Sunday of the first weekend. On Main Street, the USC Alumni Association had rented out the Riverhorse Hall and hosted a formal meetup between Trojans at the festival. 
USC alumnus Erick Castrillon premiered his film “Blast Beat,” a story about two Colombian brothers preparing to move to America right before the new millennium. 
For him it was an unforgettable dream come true, he said. Being part of the dramatic competition with a story partially in another language represented and elevated everything he stood for: family. Castrillon’s team was able to deliver its message for a more inclusive America and to its surprise, the audience was receptive. It is Sundance, after all.
Sundance Film Festival has, in its 30-plus years, made a name for itself as ground zero for the cinematic storytelling of the future. Between snow-capped mountains and snowy ski lodges, magic was brewing constantly between attendees and creators at Sundance. For the last two weekends, Park City, Utah has been an epicenter for original ideas and fresh perspectives in filmmaking. And there’s no sign of the festival going back on that promise in the coming years.

I used to be the bravest girl on the playground.
Every day in preschool, I played pirates with the boys, dashing between the swings and through the mulch while the rest of my female classmates ran and hid so we couldn’t tag them. But if any boy dared to call a girl slower or start a debate about the superior gender, I fought back and explained over and over again that girls could do anything boys could. 
And for a long time, I believed those words. I took on the same higher-level classes as my male peers and spoke up when I knew the answer to a complicated algebra equation or when I wanted to share my analysis of a metaphor in the latest novel we read in school. 
In my seventh grade English class, when we had to pick a partner for a group activity, three classmates argued over who had to work with me. They saw me as a know-it-all and kiss-up because of how often I participated, and they practically begged my teacher and classmates to save them from having to be in my group. 
When one of them eventually gave up and partnered with me, another girl arrived late to class and joined our group. They made clear from the start that they didn’t want to hear me, and that if I did speak, they would ignore me. 
From then on, when teachers asked a question, I kept my hand glued to my desk. My participation grades dipped through middle school, high school and now college as I shut my mouth in class discussions, opting to write my thoughts instead of speaking them in hopes of becoming more likable. The idea of voicing my opinion and the risk of being noticed and laughed at made me shake with anxiety, so I stayed toward the back, kept my head down and watched everyone around me pull ahead.
For a long time, I saw my male classmates do what I wanted to do. They spoke their minds and argued their opinions. Rather than backlash, they received praise. No one chuckled at their Ivy League dreams as they did mine.
But I didn’t think any of my experiences had to do with my gender identity and the way society views women. After learning about women’s triumphs during the suffrage movement, the sexual revolution and decades of civil rights work in history classes, I saw sexism as antiquitous. Instead, I blamed myself every time someone labeled me annoying or bossy or rude — even if my actions seemed just.
It wasn’t until a freshman seminar during my first semester at USC that I started wondering how my identity affected my perception of myself and others. 
Our professor assigned an essay prompt that seemed simple: Talk about your identity and explain how it has affected your life. My fingers hovered over my keyboard for hours, but every time I started typing, I slammed the backspace key and watched the words disappear. 
It’s difficult to explain the intricacies of the female identity, especially when subtle sexist comments and ideas become so ingrained in our lives that we stop recognizing when someone insults us or talks down to us just for being women. I also realize that I navigate the world with a high level of privilege, and I don’t have to deal with the racist, homophobic and ableist rhetoric and other hateful comments that come up just as casually in mainstream media and everyday interactions.
But as I’ve grown up, the small cracks people made in my self-esteem grew with each time I learned someone saw me as a bitch or a show-off. With every knock on my appearance, every joke about my stern face or harsh tone of voice and every insult toward my intelligence, or lack thereof, those fissures widened. They expanded until there was a canyon-sized gap between the confident girl I had been and the woman I see in the mirror today.
None of these ideas are new. There are female writers, singers, politicians, actors, athletes and artists discussing the gender disparities they’ve faced on larger platforms and to wider audiences. I still hope this column can provide some form of clarity for young women like me who tore themselves apart over sexist insults that were neither based in reality nor meant to help them improve. 
Writing this column is a way for me to further explore what it means to be a woman in 2020 and grapple with both the blatant and subtle sexism that causes women like me to lose ourselves and give up on the dreams we were told we couldn’t achieve. 
Slowly but surely, I’m working to close that gap and grow into a version of myself who would make 9-year-old me proud, and that starts with sharing my thoughts and opinions ever other week in this space. I’ll use this column to share my thoughts and talk with experts about how various policy decisions, media coverage and everyday rhetoric can negatively affect women.
Most importantly for myself, with each edition of this column, I’ll publish my opinions without fear. I’ll continue to do just that until speaking up and saying what I think is no longer an act of courage, but a normal part of each day.

“Will you marry me?”
“I don’t know. What’s in it for me?”
“Anything you want.”
In a sequence in “Dazed and Confused,” incoming freshmen girls are hazed by rising seniors, forced to objectify themselves and pretend to offer up their newly-christened womanhood to sleazy, problematic men. 
When a young girl unwittingly falls into the lewd trap, where a senior asks her if she spits or swallows, she walks away dejected. The senior chuckles — it’s only a joke, right? — and his friend shakes his head and tells him it’s degrading and terrible. But he does so between laughs, sociologically confirming the fact that the senior probably shouldn’t have done that, but it’s not like it’s a big deal.
The nature of the so-called “nice guy,” the apex of allyship, is a sham. If you’ve ever claimed you weren’t like all men, distanced yourself from the uncomfortable yet necessary pushback against male hegemony, thought that “anything” could now constitute as sexual harassment or laughed off your bro’s lighthearted rape-culture-encouraging joke (because, hey, it’s not like you say that kind of stuff) — this applies to you. You are also the problem. 
There is a distinction to be made here: Nice guys, who are polite and seemingly conscientious, are not always good men. The typical male ally stands with and for women — that is, until there aren’t any women around. In laid-back settings, when he’s only surrounded by other men, this self-identifying ally isn’t actually an ally at all, passively encouraging misogynistic behavior and language by remaining silent.
Jennifer Brown, a renowned diversity consultant, states that allyship occurs on a spectrum, ranging from men who are apathetic (clueless about gender issues) to those who are aware (having some knowledge on issues but not actively trying to solve them) to active (those who are well-informed and willing to have uncomfortable conversations) to advocate (who actually work to advance women’s rights).
The reality is that most men fall into the former categories, proclaiming themselves feminists on the surface yet failing to contribute to or engage in honest, oftentimes uneasy, conversations about privilege — a direct result of indoctrination into the cult of hypermasculinity. 
Men who stand up for women in the workplace are perceived by both men and women as more submissive, less competent and, through their allyship with women, more feminine, according to a study published by the American Psychological Association. And while most men say they care about gender parity and are working to uplift women, a national survey conducted by Promundo, an organization that promotes gender equality, reveals otherwise. Although 48% of men surveyed said they have become more aware of sexism in the workplace in the past year, approximately  60% of women and men agreed that it’s rare to see men speak out against it.
This gap in allyship is incredibly harmful, actively undermining hard-fought achievements toward gender equity. When men give into toxic masculinity — into bro culture — they not only dehumanize themselves through facades of emotional detachment and nonchalance but they also encourage a world where linguistic violence toward women flourishes. As language then influences normative values, shaping sociological interactions, so then is actual violence toward women accepted.
From a sociological standpoint, people — especially young people — desire a sense of belonging to and acceptance from a community. Within male friend groups, masculinity acts as a toxic constraint on all the choices men make, even those that have seemingly nothing to do with gender. Loyalty is crucial, and this friendship is sealed by an adherence to misogyny, rejection of feminine behavior and passive participation in sexism — if not overt aggressive behavior.
The “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas” mentality, the clear delineation between what can be said in public versus the locker room (and the fraternity house, military barracks, Wall Street business meetings, among other male-dominated environments) still governs male interactions, dictating what they can or can’t say. 
When it comes to oppression, marginalized groups are never given the space to advocate for themselves, never mind the fact that the burden of educating others out of their ignorance should not lie solely on their shoulders. Women have tried, time and time again, to make themselves heard, push themselves into spaces where they are unwanted, all the while meticulously performing gender expression gymnastics to avoid being called bitches. 
It is absolutely vital that men begin educating other men. 
Willfully engaging in dialogue about how you and your friends are a part of the problem is uncomfortable and takes a level of self-awareness and poise most men don’t have. It means losing friends (ones you probably shouldn’t want in the first place, though), and it means being feminized — something our culture views as the worst thing you can be.

The Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, International Student Assembly and Undergraduate Student Government criticized the discrimination toward Asian and Asian American students that has risen in response to the coronavirus scare in a letter sent to the student body Friday. The letter was a response to a Monday incident where The Lorenzo sent an erroneous email that reported a resident  contracted the disease. 
“With the recent spread of misinformation and distress about the potential spread of the novel coronavirus, we want to send a message … to support the rights of students to live, study and participate at USC without fear of discrimination based on their national origin, race, ethnicity, or travel history,” the letter read. 
The letter was co-signed by 26 other student organizations including the Chinese American Student Association and the Student Coalition for Asian Pacific Empowerment. It was written by ISA Executive Director Jina Hur and APASA Executive Director Michelle Phan. 
“We’ve had a couple peers talk to us about the discrimination that they felt,” Phan said. “It’s not only a scare on campus but they’re scared for their own [family in Wuhan] as well. The fact that they’ve been experiencing discriminatory remarks that make them feel uncomfortable, they just kind of felt no longer safe on their own campus.”
Memes and false information spread on social media following the Monday incident, including on the USC memes pages and in a Latinx group chat. The xenophobic memes specifically targeted international Asian and Asian American communities on campus. 
Melody Yao, a sophomore majoring in psychology and economics-mathematics, said she hasn’t faced any discrimination in person but that she has been affected by the student-made memes as well as students calling it the “Chinese virus.”
“Some people just started making really stupid memes,” Yao said. “They think they’re funny but not necessarily. I get that some people are trying to lighten up the mood, but I think they’re doing it regardless of how other groups of people will feel looking at those memes.”
Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman said that discriminatory comments on the illness are problematic and concerning as they spread misinformation about the Chinese community. 
“We’re very concerned that we’re hearing that students from China or students from the Wuhan province are being targeted,” Van Orman said. “It’s very easy to try to kind of point fingers at a group of people or individuals and think that if we just keep them away that somehow we’ll all be safe, and that’s really dangerous and discriminatory.”
Although Hur has avoided the offensive memes, she said this dialogue continues to marginalize the Asian and Asian American community with false stereotypes attached to how the virus originated in China. 
“I know there’s dialogue going around that people are saying that the coronavirus started because the Chinese people eat bats and that they deserve it because they’re gross and barbaric and they brought that upon themselves,” Hur said. 
The letter also states the importance of reporting any discrimination students face at the University to the USC Office of Equity and Diversity and the Bias Reporting System. It called for the University to reaffirm its letter and send out an official statement to stand in solidarity with students who have been marginalized because of  misinformation about the coronavirus. 
“I feel like during times like this they address the logistical things like take care of your health but [they] don’t really address the adversity of certain communities that are particularly affected,” Phan said. 
The coronavirus incident was also addressed at a USG meeting Tuesday where USG Sen. Angela Chuang asked those in attendance to be aware of the false information spreading online targeting Asian students. 
“I want to remind everyone and encourage everyone to be mindful about what you’re sharing … on social media because a lot of these posts are very anti-Asian,” Chuang said. “Our international student population and our Asian American student population are being affected by this because [we’re worried about our] relatives back in Asia.”
USG President Trenton Stone met with Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp to receive approval to send the letter University-wide. According to Stone, various professors and University officials on campus, including Crisp, are aware of the offensive comments made by students.
[The University] definitely recognize this as an issue … so I know that they plan to make sure that language is included in future [coronavirus updates].”
The University was unable to respond in time for publication but sent a University-wide memo Tuesday affirming the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health statement that individuals should not be excluded based on their country of origin, race or recent travel in China. 
“There is no immediate threat to the general public,” the LADPH statement read. “No special precautions are required, and people should not be excluded from activities based on their race, country of origin, or recent travel if they do not have symptoms of respiratory illness.”
Stone also reiterated the LADPH statement and said that each student should be aware of what they post on social media. 
“Just because the coronavirus originated somewhere, it doesn’t mean we need to be lumping identities and national origins together and having fear of vast groups of people,” Stone said. “I encourage everyone to continue to be cautious in what they say and what they do, and how they view people who may not be similar to them.”

College admissions scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer told at least one set of parents a portion of the money they paid for their children’s admission would go directly to the University, prosecutors confirmed in a filing in federal court Friday.
According to the document, Singer told “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, that the two initial payments of $50,000 they made to secure their daughters’ admissions to USC as women’s rowing recruits were legitimate donations to the University. 
“Singer did recall telling the Giannulli[s] that the first $50,000 for each girl went to USC,” the document stated. “They did not specifically discuss the amount of money that would go to a USC program out of the $200,000.”
The couple allegedly paid Singer $500,000 between October 2016 and February 2018 and said they believed a portion of the money was sent as a gift to the University’s athletics program and Galen Center rather than a bribe to senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel, who accepted the students’ falsified recruitment profiles and presented them to admissions committees for approval, as the prosecution originally contended. Singer also testified that the couple believed part of the two $200,000 payments they made upon their daughters’ offers of conditional admission would go to the University.
Loughlin and Giannulli’s defense filed a motion in December claiming Singer had misled the couple and asserting that the bribery would be unfounded if the defense could prove the couple did not intend to defraud the University. Federal programs bribery carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of twice the amount of money involved.
Loughlin and Giannulli currently face charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery and conspiracy to commit money laundering for their role in the admissions scandal. 
Singer pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of justice in March after agreeing to cooperate with federal investigators and prosecutors in September 2018. He recorded phone calls with the parents involved and collected information about the scheme to submit to the prosecution in the months leading up to the case being  made public in March.
In another filing made Wednesday, the prosecution proposed a set of two to three hearings for the parents who have pleaded not guilty and requested that Loughlin and Giannulli stand trial in October with the first group of parents.
Of the 36 parents named in the admissions case, 15 — including 11 USC parents — have opted to contest charges. They will be tried and, if found guilty, sentenced in federal court in a series of hearings expected to continue through early 2021, according to the memorandum filed by prosecutors Wednesday. 
In a separate reply document filed Friday, Loughlin and Giannulli responded to allegations that they had not released potentially incriminating evidence to the prosecution, reiterating that the government was refusing to release information that could support the defense’s argument. The defense also alleged that the government pressured Loughlin and Giannulli into pleading guilty, falsely claimed it had released all relevant evidence and intimidated parents who chose not to plead guilty by bringing additional charges against them.
The defense stated that because the government did not turn over the evidence by the initial release deadline May 30, the court should require prosecutors to release all information that could be used in the couple’s defense argument.
“As its eleventh-hour disclosures illustrate, the Government cannot be trusted to make Brady determinations on its own,” the document stated. “This Court should put a stop to the Government’s unconstitutional game of evidentiary hide-and-seek once and for all.”
The Brady Rule requires prosecutors to release all information relevant to the questions of the defendants’ guilt to the defense.
In the reply, the defense also argued that because USC confirmed that parents’ legitimate philanthropy can impact the likelihood of their children’s admission and because some of the money Loughlin and Giannulli paid for their daughters’ acceptances was deposited into University accounts — albeit ones controlled by Heinel — the payments cannot be considered bribes.
“The Government’s theory is apparently that even though USC affirmatively accepts donations in exchange for admissions, and even though that approach is ‘legitimate,’ and even though Giannulli and Loughlin’s donations actually went to USC and not into the pockets of a rogue employee, Giannulli and Loughlin are still somehow guilty of paying bribes to defraud USC,” the document read. “That argument flunks common sense.”
The reply included requests for specific evidence, including information about the extent of University officials’ knowledge of the donations made by parents in the scandal and complete copies of Singer’s testimonies regarding what he told the parents of their payments’ allocation.
Loughlin and Giannulli’s next status conference is scheduled for Feb. 27.

In response to student complaints regarding the new attendance policy, the department made changes Wednesday to clarify that excused absences could be used in exceptional situations such as family emergencies, the Acting Chair of the School of Cinematic Arts’ John Wells Division of Writing for Screen and Television David Isaacs said.
“We were trying to make it a little more flexible — where we went wrong was not putting in the exceptions,” Isaacs said. “If you had an emergency, a family emergency, certainly a health or an emotional issue, religious holiday — all of those kinds of things are, of course, going to be allowed.” 
The clarified policy was emailed to professors Wednesday so they could update their syllabuses and inform their students of the changes. However, multiple students told the Daily Trojan they had not been made aware of the clarification.
The previous version of the attendance policy stated the department would no longer distinguish between excused and unexcused absences starting this semester. Beyond the first two absences, each missed class lowers students’ course grades by 10%, and two late arrivals count as one full absence.  In the past policy no unexcused absences were allowed.  
SCA students drafted an official complaint to the administration last month stating that the attendance policy was harmful to students’ physical and mental well-being in a department as competitive as SCA. 
“In an environment as high-stress as SCA, in which students work full-time jobs on top of taking full courseloads, it is imperative that students have the chance to rest,” the letter read. “Of course, it would be optimal if that time of rest did not have to come during class hours, but students should be free to take that time if necessary, as we discussed in the memorial meeting last semester.” 
Isaacs explained the reasoning behind the policy was to allow students to miss class without having to submit excuse notes. 
“We voted on it as a full-time faculty back in November,” Isaacs said. “We had discussed opening up the idea of allowing for an extra unexcused absence and then letting the students know the line that we would allow in terms of them not having to account for their coming to class.”
Isaacs said the way the policy had been worded led to confusion, with students thinking they would no longer have excused absences. However, Isaacs said  students will be allowed two unexcused absences in addition to excused absences. 
“It’s not meant to be punishing,” Isaacs said. “It’s meant to allow them a little more freedom and the idea that there are exceptions beyond the two unexcused absences.” 
Isaacs said that as soon as he heard student feedback about the policy, he realized the miscommunication that had taken place and decided to rewrite the policy. 
The new policy states that absence exceptions will be made for religious holidays and DSP accommodations. It also states that students can get instructor approval to miss class for medical and family emergencies and to accommodate personal well-being needs. 
Roma Murphy, a senior majoring in writing for screen and television, said none of her professors had mentioned the change or updated their syllabuses with the new policy. She also said she thinks the attendance policy changes should be addressed to the student body.
“The updated version of the policy needs to be sent to the student body as a whole,” Murphy said. “Students don’t have the information with which they can advocate for themselves.”
Murphy said the administration should listen to student voices before implementing policies in order to strengthen communication and enhance transparency within the administration.
“There needs to be more communication from the administration to the student body whenever they’re going to implement a new policy,” Murphy said. “There needs to be more opportunity for students to give feedback on administration.”

A pickup truck struck a vehicle Sunday that was double parked in an eastbound lane of Jefferson Boulevard near Watt Way.  A student inside the parked vehicle sustained injuries but did not require medical transport, Department of Public Safety Assistant Chief David Carlisle said. 
Carlisle said he could not comment on the condition of the student due to privacy laws but no serious injuries were reported. The driver of the truck, who is not a student, was transported to a local hospital for treatment.
“There does not appear to be serious injuries, but there is a complaint of pain,” Carlisle said.  “Fire department paramedics are checking the people involved in the collision.”
Carlisle said the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the case.
The vehicle was rear-ended by the truck, which then collided into the center divider.Both vehicles involved in the collision sustained significant damage, Carlisle said.
LAPD did not respond to request for comment in time for publication.
