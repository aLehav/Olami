Clay Helton had his interim tag removed earlier this week, and in his first game as the team’s permanent head coach, he and the Trojans are faced with the task of stopping No. 7-ranked Stanford in Saturday’s Pac-12 title showdown at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara. If they’re  able to do so, they have the chance to come away with the program’s first conference crown since the 2008-2009 season, which would earn them a trip to the Rose Bowl.
USC (8-4, 6-3 Pac-12) is hoping to avenge its loss earlier this season to the Cardinal (10-2, 8-1), who marched into the Coliseum and handed USC its first loss of the season. In that game, fifth-year senior quarterback Kevin Hogan powered the Stanford offense to 474 yards and bullied their way to a 41-31 upset of the then-No. 6 ranked Trojans.
“It’s the most physical game I’ve ever played in,” redshirt sophomore safety Chris Hawkins said.
Two different roads 
Since that game, though, both teams have gone in two different directions.
Despite losing its first game of the season to Northwestern, Stanford won eight of its last nine games en route to running away with the North title — its third in four years — despite a late push by Oregon. Last week, it not only derailed then-No. 6-ranked Notre Dame’s College Football Playoff hopes after knocking off the Irish on a go-ahead field goal as time expired, but also continued to build its case for playoff consideration.
The No. 24-ranked Men of Troy, on the other hand,  experienced a tough stretch, losing to Washington at home on a Thursday night, which led to the firing of Steve Sarkisian only a few days later. That’s before before Helton stepped in and turned the Trojans’ entire season around, leading the team to wins in five of its last seven games on its way to winning the Pac-12 South title after defeating crosstown rival UCLA last Saturday for the first time in four seasons.
Though each team’s journey to the conference championship has been drastically different, both teams will be riding into the game with momentum, coming off wins against perennial rivals.
“This was the plan to be here from Week One and I don’t like the way that we got here, but I mean I’ll take it,” junior linebacker Su’a Cravens said.
The Trojans, however, might have gotten a little extra motivation to win Saturday’s game with Helton in the position to notch his first win as the official leader of the program.
Formula for Success 
Ever since taking over for Sarkisian, Helton has strived to instill a formula of “running the ball, stopping the run and not turning it over,” which has contributed to much of the Trojans’ success.
In the seven games for which Helton has been at the helm, USC has out rushed its opponents in every game by an average of just under 140 yards, in addition to holding a plus-nine turnover margin.
The Men of Troy have also taken a page out of Stanford head coach David Shaw and the Cardinal’s book by slowing down the tempo of the game via the ground the game, which has allowed them to control the ball for the most part. The Trojans have won the time-of-possession battle in each one of its last seven games, except at Colorado. Last week against UCLA, they ran the ball 59 times on their way to out possessing by a third of the game.
The USC ground game has featured a committee of running backs over the course of the season and has been anchored by leading rushers Ronald Jones II, who surpassed Charles White to become the leading freshman rusher in USC history, along with and junior Justin Davis.
Nonetheless,Saturday’s matchup will feature a display of two ground-and-pound teams with similar playing styles. USC will have to try and put the brakes on one of the hottest running backs in the country, in sophomore running back Heisman Trophy contender Christian McCaffrey.
Stopping McCaffrey 
Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year McCaffrey, who is also a semifinalist and finalist for a number of other postseason awards of the, broke a conference single-season record by totaling 3,035 all-purpose yards during the regular season.
In addition to setting a few other school records, the Colorado native posted nine-consecutive 100-yard rushing games. He finished second in the Pac-12 in rushing this season with an average of 136.7 yards per game, only behind Oregon’s Royce Freeman.
There’s no doubt that he will be a focal point in the defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox and the USC defense’s game plan to stopping the Stanford offense.
“He’s a great player, very versatile and that’s pretty much what you get when you going against a good guy like that,” sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson said.
Last time USC played the Cardinal, McCaffrey put up 249 all-purpose yards, including 115 yards on the ground.
What we need to focus on is the execution during the game and the results … you know those things come with that,” Wilcox said.
Hogan, who completed nearly 80 percent of his passes and threw for 279 yards and two touchdowns against USC earlier this season, will also serve as a threat both with his arms and his legs.
“We’ve got to be able to mix up defensive calls to throw them off-base too,’’ Helton said. “I know Justin has a great plan, and I like where these kids are at, especially with the confidence they gained last week.’’
Saturday’s game will kick off at 4:45 p.m. and will be televised nationally on ESPN.

Win or go home · Junior driver Blake Edwards and the Trojans are playing in the program’s 11th consecutive NCAA tournament. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The USC men’s water polo team looks ahead to its 11th consecutive appearance in the NCAA Tournament, which begins with a play-in game against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Thursday night at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
A win over the Stags would send the Trojans to the semifinals, where they would face either UCLA or Cal. USC has appeared in the NCAA title match the last 10 seasons.
“It speaks for itself,” sophomore utility player James Walters said of the tournament streak. “It’s an awesome tradition here. The coaches know what they’re doing. They know how to prepare their teams to get into the NCAA tournament, and ultimately, it’s up to the players to perform.”
The Trojans earned an at-large bid with a third place finish in the MPSF Tournament last week. After a disappointing 11-6 loss to UCLA in the semifinals, USC came back strong with an 8-4 victory over Pacific in the third place game to advance their record to 20-6.
USC has not lost to Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in its history, coming in with a record of 10-0 all-time against the Stags, including a 20-5 win at the Inland Empire Classic on Sept. 13. The two programs have not met in the NCAA Tournament.
Though the Trojans have their eyes set on UCLA or Cal in the next round, they must focus on the first hurdle Thursday.
“We’re looking at the overall goal of the season,” Walters said. “We want to win NCAA. We can’t be overconfident. Anyone can knock us out. We just have to stay focused for each game.”
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps enters the play-in game on a 17-game win streak. After starting the season 4-7, the Stags have not lost a match since September and seem like a different team than the one USC routed three months ago. They defeated Whittier 12-11 in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Championship to earn an at-large bid.
The match will take place at 7 p.m. on Thursday at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. It will follow the other play-in game between UC San Diego and Princeton at 5 p.m.
If they advance to the next stage, the Men of Troy will likely be headed for a collision course with top-ranked UCLA in a battle for the title. But things are little different this year with UCLA coming in as defending champions and following it up with an unbeaten season.
“The pressure’s all on UCLA this year,” sophomore goalie McQuin Baron said. “It’s finally no longer on USC since [the Bruins are] the reigning champions, and they had their undefeated season.”“No one’s looking for USC to win the championship game. Obviously, we are though.”
The NCAA tournament will be held at the Spieker Aquatics Center at UCLA Dec. 5 and 6.

USC’s newest football coach, Clay Helton, may turn out to be a masterful hire. He loves physical football, dedicates coaching time to both sides of the ball, and has that “it” factor with his inspirational speeches. He seems to be a no frills type of coach who just loves football, a model that has worked extremely well for coaches like Nick Saban and Urban Meyer. A manic dedication to the job appears to be essential in the hunt for championships.
This is not to say Helton is anywhere near the caliber of coach that Saban and Meyer are, not yet anyway. This alone makes the timing of Helton’s hire questionable.
Yes, Helton has shown great leadership skills in times of crisis and for the most part his power running based offensive scheme has paid dividends, but he hasn’t truly wowed anyone with his coaching. After all, the Trojans went 5-2 to end the regular season under Helton. He has made mistakes in terms of clock management, and his penchant for bubble screens continues the Kiffin and Sarkisian lineage. The team is disoriented on offensive plays occasionally, and they play relatively undisciplined.
None of these factors should have disqualified Helton from the job, he just should not have been a shoo-in candidate before the season ended. A lot of these mistakes can probably be attributed to his adjustment to head coaching duties midseason, as well as the youth of the team. There is no doubt that coaches can evolve and get better, especially with an offseason to develop and analyze their skills. With Helton’s work ethic, I believe this will be the case.
However, understanding that each game Helton has improved as a coach, why wouldn’t the Trojan decision makers want to extend the sample size of games coached, especially two upcoming games with high stakes. Wouldn’t it have made sense to see how Helton has evolved in a big game from his debut against Notre Dame to Stanford?
What about how he would do during the dead weeks in between the championship and a potential Rose Bowl or lesser tier bowl? It would have been helpful to see how he improved in that period from the last time he did this two seasons ago. Helton’s performance thus far has been solid and respectable, but certainly not to a tremendous degree that would eliminate any need to continue an exhaustive coaching search.
This hire feels rushed, much like the Sarkisian one a few days after the UCLA game two years ago. We all know how that turned out. It is pretty disconcerting to see an Athletics Department failing to learn from its past mistakes and, again, rush into a decision. That’s not to say Helton may not be successful, it just would have made complete sense to wait until after the bowl season and see if there was any interest from prominent coaches.
Some might say that USC needs a coach for recruiting purposes, but USC recruits USC. Plain and simple. Even Paul Hackett brought in Carson Palmer and landed a commitment from Matt Leinart. Any coach USC hired would be able to piece together a top class.
Locking in on one guy and ignoring everyone else is what landed us an inept and unprofessional coach last time. Helton seems to have more character, but it is still worrisome to see such stubborn and arrogant behavior from the Athletics Department. Learning from mistakes is the only way to prevent them from happening again. USC has so many resources that the right coach turns around the program in an instant. It could have waited one more month to make sure that Helton was the best guy to do that.
I sincerely hope Helton does prove to be that guy. He has the raw materials to make it happen, and if he can hone his craft further, he can create a legacy that follows in the footsteps of Jones, Carroll, and McKay. Beating Stanford on Saturday would be a great place to start his journey.

i would have thought a two year contract would have been used instead of a five.
You left out John Robinson who was most successful the first time around as Head Coach after McKay. Gloomy Gus Henderson had the best winning % of them all back in the day. The hiring of Clay Helton was a rush to judgment fearing he would go elsewhere, and trying to keep the recruiting class in hand. You need to find out who else was contacted and interviewed by Haden and staff before their final decision was made which was not the first choice.

Junior Morgan Andrews is not one to shy away from a 50/50 challenge.
Andrews, a standout midfielder on the women’s soccer team, was an absolute force for the Trojans this season. The junior tallied 12 goals and four assists in 23 games and helped lead the team to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.
A New Hampshire native, Andrews has found a home away from home in Los Angeles. She made her way to Troy after transferring from Notre Dame following her sophomore campaign.
“Transferring is very hard for anybody, whether you’re an athlete or not,” she said. “You kind of pick up your life and start somewhere new, and it’s a difficult process. But at the same time USC made it really easy for me, and my team made it easy for me.”
Andrews seamlessly slid into the starting 11 for the Women of Troy, working well with her teammates from the season’s outset. The midfield trio of Mandy Freeman, Nicole Molen and Andrews was unstoppable at times.
“It’s very visible that we want to play off of each other,” Andrews said of her fellow midfielders. “We want to find each other.”
The passing was crisp. The movement was fluid. The soccer was irresistible.
This style comes naturally to Andrews. Over the years, she has had coaches from all over the world, and she has clearly blended several playing styles into one.
“I try to, I guess, take a little bit of each style and put it into my game,” she said.
She loves the creativity of the Brazilian style but is also drawn to the way the British knock the ball about the pitch. This combination of playing styles — plus the unwavering aggressiveness with which she plays — makes her virtually impossible to guard.
“I like to aggressively attack at people, and I want to score,” Andrews said.
However, she is also the coolest of customers — one of those players whose sheer presence can quell a storm on the pitch.
“I want to bring that calm aspect to the rest of my team,” Andrews said.
This calming influence is not a trait that only comes out when she crosses the white line to descend into battle. The beast that opposing players attempt to mark is as understated off the field as she is imposing on the field.
But as game time approaches, the laid-back young lady from the small town of Milford changes character — or at least her playlist does.
Jack Johnson and Dave Matthews are put on pause, making way for Linkin Park as kickoff approaches.
“I try to stay calm for as long as I can until the nerves start kicking in,” she said.
Andrews’ energy before games is contagious — and quite visible.
“I’m a big dancer when it comes to warm-up,” Andrews said.
Andrews has become a fan of the Isley Brothers’ classic song “Shout!” ever since joining the team. Prior to the second-half kickoff of every home game, USC players throw their hands up and dance to the song.
Unsurprisingly, Andrews fits right in.
The team maintains a uniquely carefree vibe, even when the game is tight and the stakes are high.
This was the case when the Trojans faced Cal State Fullerton in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
The team trailed 2-0 and was on the brink of elimination. Poised and unfazed by the deficit, Andrews took the field for the second half and, as usual, began to do the “Shout!” dance.
She went on to score a hat trick in the second half, as the Women of Troy downed Fullerton on penalties to advance to the second round. For the two-time Gatorade National High School Player of the Year recipient, this was just another day at the office.
Balance is key in soccer. Balance on the ball is of course a necessity, as is balancing power with finesse, which Andrews does effortlessly. But balance between the ears is also essential. Andrews plays with joy and seriousness simultaneously.
She never looked frazzled against Fullerton, yet she clearly understood the reality of the two-goal deficit. Her performance during the latter 45 minutes of that contest looked eerily similar to the kind of clutch showing U.S. women’s national team star Carli Lloyd has come up with time and time again.
In fact, Lloyd is one of Andrews’ biggest role models.
“She’s just an absolute beast,” Andrews said of Lloyd. “She really just knows how to finish a game.”
There are plenty of similarities between the youngster Andrews and the veteran Lloyd, even aside from the “clutch” gene. Both players have the ability to outmuscle opponents before beating them with quickness, tidy footwork, exceptional vision and passing range.
Both Andrews and Lloyd are cerebral players, making them tactically sound on both offense and defense. It also means they are excellent decision-makers with the ball at their feet.
Andrews has experience at the youth national team level and could very well be on her way to becoming the next Lloyd.
Andrews is a student of the game. She acknowledges the shortcomings in her game and strives to improve upon them.
“I definitely have a lot of flaws when it comes to soccer,” she said.
Andrews noted that she is still working on making better decisions on the field, especially when it comes to resisting that 60-yard glory ball and choosing the simple option instead.
Her movements on the field are purposeful, as are her reasons for playing the game.
Andrews has played soccer since age three. Every time she steps onto the field, she plays for the people who have been there for her every step of the way. She plays for her parents, for her two older brothers and for the young girls who want to play college and professional soccer someday.
She also plays for her coaching staff, led by head coach Keidane McAlpine.
“Just the entire staff is amazing,” Andrews said. “I learn something new every day at training, whether it be technically or tactically, or just something I didn’t know about myself or something that I didn’t know that I could implement into the team.”
And, of course, Andrews plays for her teammates. She lauded her team’s morale. Even when trailing 2-0 at the interval against Fullerton, she said her teammates were still confident.
“No one was scared,” she said. “It was the best environment that you could have possibly been in.”
This team won many games this year, due in large part to sound defense and possession-based offense.
“Everyone is a defender first and then an attacker,” Andrews said. “We want to keep the ball. We want to possess.”
Though USC played an attractive brand of soccer and dominated the middle of the park in most games, Andrews hit a speed bump at the end of October. In one of the biggest games of the season — a road test against an elite Stanford team — Andrews went down with an injury just 20 minutes into the fixture.
She had suffered a severe ankle sprain. USC lost the game 1-0.
As she returned to the field following the loss to the Cardinal, Andrews was able to eliminate any lingering feelings of doubt or negativity. On game days, she writes a phrase or a word on her arm in black marker. The phrase may alter from game to game, but it is always one that encapsulates her competitive spirit and exorcises the demons of an ankle injury or fatigue.
When Andrews looks down at her arm and reads a simple yet powerful word like “passion” or “grit,” she continues fighting. She deals with asthma yet still works tirelessly on the field, covering seemingly every inch of turf over the course of the 90 minutes.
Andrews is a consummate professional and  team player and has lofty yet attainable personal goals for her soccer career.
“I have the same goals as I did when I was younger,” she said. “And that is to be a professional player, and also Olympian and a World Cup champion. But I’m starting to be more mature about it and set my goals with timelines.”
Andrews’s future in the sport looks bright, but at some point in the distant future she will be forced to hang up the boots.
A broadcast and digital journalism major at USC, Andrews loves telling stories. In the future, she wants to share her passion for exploration and nature, perhaps as an adventure sport videographer or photographer.
“I want to tell stories that make people feel something,” she said. “I want to climb Everest, I want to jump out of planes — that kind of stuff.”
For the time being, however, Andrews is busy writing an epic on the soccer field.

The women’s volleyball team begins its bid for the NCAA championship in Thursday’s first round NCAA tournament match against Cleveland State. The Trojans, who were Pac-12 co-champions with Washington, are the top seed in the tournament and the No. 1 team in the nation.
The Trojans enjoyed an impressive regular season, finishing with a 30-2 overall record. Now, head coach Mick Haley, who was named Pac-12 Coach of the Year Tuesday, is excited to see what his team will bring to the court in the postseason.
“We’ve had three good days of practice,” he said. “We are finally starting to get back in rhythm.”
There were only two blips in USC’s three-month march to the Pac-12 crown, but one of them was bitterly disappointing, as the Women of Troy dropped a five-set heartbreaker to crosstown rival UCLA last week. The defeat was USC’s first home loss of the season, and it meant the team lost sole possession of the conference championship.
Haley said the team was out of sync throughout the match against the Bruins and personally took much of the blame, admitting that he didn’t put his squad in the best position to edge the critical fifth set.
“I told the players it was on me and to keep fighting,” he said. “And they did that against Cal [last Friday].”
Now, after a rebound win and a strong week of practice, the team looks to find its rhythm when it matters most.
“It’s a mental game,” freshman setter Baylee Johnson said. “Once we start passing well, we start setting well, and then it’s easy to get in rhythm.”
The consensus at the Galen Center seemed to be that the Trojans need to get back in sync, so Haley was pleased to have an extended period of time at home to practice in the week leading up to the tournament.
“We’ve been struggling because we couldn’t practice,” he said. “When you can’t practice and your body is sore and tired, you just have to compete.”
Nevertheless, Haley praised his players for their fighting spirit throughout the grueling schedule. In addition to Haley’s award, the Women of Troy have racked up a stack of accolades this season, including for senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who was named Pac-12 Player of the Year.
“I could make a case for [junior setter Alice] Pizzasegola and [freshman libero Victoria] Garrick, and that would have meant every one of our players would have been recognized [by the Pac-12],” Haley said.
Senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms and sophomore opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie were named to the Pac-12 All-Conference Team alongside Bricio, while junior middle blocker Elise Ruddins, junior libero Taylor Whittingham and freshman outside hitters Alyse Ford and Baylee Johnson were honorable mentions. Ford and Johnson also made the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team.
The highly decorated squad will look to earn the ultimate team honor later in the month, but the Women of Troy begin their road to Omaha at home against Cleveland State. The Vikings finished the season with a 26-6 record, including their run to the Horizon League championship. The last meeting between USC and CSU came over three decades ago, when the Trojans claimed a two-set sweep over the Vikings in the only meeting in the two programs’ history.
The winner between USC and Cleveland State will face off against the winner of Thursday’s early matchup between San Diego and Northern Arizona — all three matches are in the Galen Center. The next rounds move on to San Diego, before the championship in Omaha.
The team knows, however, that it will be six more punishing games if everything goes according to plan. With high expectations as well as media attention as No. 1 seeds, the Women of Troy aim to stay focused and grounded all the way through the next few weeks.
“We’re trying to stay together as a team,” Ogoms said. “We’re going to try to stay focused on what we came here to do. We’re going to try to win every game that’s in front of us.”
First serve between USC and the Vikings will be at 7:30 p.m. at the Galen Center.
They are a big loss, but Brittany, Ruddins, Bailey, Garrik and Ford, who will be an incredible back row player next season, plus the incredible group of incoming freshmen and the remaining girls who red shirted this year will make a very strong team. Is that the worst run-on sentence you have ever seen or what! And don’t forget about Jordan, a 6’4 middle blocker. Wow, another pac12 championship awaits. Stanford and Wash graduate their very best players. We got this.
They better do something big this  year . Losing Bricio and Ogams will leave the team in a poor position for next season. Maybe the two front line freshman players will bring a new spark.

Tradition · Members of the Trojan Knights stand with the Victory Bell at a rally the organization hosted in Hahn Plaza Wednesday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The Trojan Knights hosted a rally in front of Tommy Trojan Wednesday afternoon to celebrate the return of the Victory Bell, the trophy awarded to the winner of the annual USC and UCLA football game.
The bell gets painted in the colors of the winning school. Though the bell has remained “true blue” for the past three years, it was restored to cardinal and gold when USC reclaimed it after Saturday’s 40-21 rout of the Bruins.
Members of the Trojan Family stood before Tommy Trojan and awaited the band, who marched in at noon accompanied by the Song Girls.
After leading the band in “Fanfare” and “Fight On,” band director Arthur C. Bartner pumped up the crowd.
“Did we beat the Bruins?” he yelled, receiving cheers in response.
Bartner then gave a speech about the true symbol of gameday,
“Now people think it’s Tommy Trojan, people think it’s Traveler, no! It is the sword,” he said. “But we’re not here to honor the sword; we’re here to honor the Victory Bell!”
After the band played “All I Do is Win,” Dr. Bartner introduced Clay Helton, USC’s newly permanent head football coach.
Helton thanked the Trojan family for their support at the football games the past season and commended the players for “fighting through some adverse conditions to bring home the Pac-12 South championship,” before ringing the bell.
The Trojan Marching Band then played “Tusk” before Bartner presented fifth-year senior Cody Kessler, who spoke about his experience as a third-year starting quarterback.
“I couldn’t think of a better way to end my career playing at the Coliseum by beating UCLA and bringing home the Victory Bell,” Kessler said.
He also proceeded to ring it, drawing claps and cheers from the audience.
The rally ended with the So-Cal spell out and “Conquest.”
Students, faculty, staff and others in the community then received the opportunity to ring and take a picture with the Victory Bell. University President C. L. Max Nikias was among those who rang the bell.
Andrew Li, a freshman majoring in business administration, attended the rally.
“I’m glad we finally got to have the Victory Bell back at USC for the first time in three years,” he said. “Hopefully we can have it here during all four of my years.”
The Knights obtained the Victory Bell from the UCLA Rally Committee Monday. The Victory Bell has been a completely student-run tradition since the Knights stole it from UCLA in 1941 and a deal was brokered by the student body presidents of both schools in 1942.
Will Orr, president of Trojan Knights, went to retrieve the bell along with other senior members and partake in the tradition for the first time, since USC hasn’t won since he’s been at school.
“To be able to come back around senior year as president, go over to UCLA and just to pull the bell out of the heart of Westwood was one of the best days ever,” he said. “I couldn’t ask for anything more.”
Repainting it was a long and involved process, according to Donald Annarella, communications director for Trojan Knights, After retrieving it from Westwood, the Trojan Knights spent five hours sanding off the UCLA blue paint before painting the bell cardinal.
“The Victory Bell is a symbol both schools hold in high regard,” Annarella said. “It only adds to our prestige, image and tradition when we actually have the bell and maintain it.”
The Trojans have two more important games before the end of the season, but for now the University celebrates the conquest of UCLA.
“We are very, very proud to bring the Victory Bell to USC,” Helton said.

Students marched on Trousdale Parkway Wednesday afternoon to advocate for the installation of solar panels on USC roofs as part of a protest organized by the USC Go Solar Campaign, a branch of the Environmental Core.
Connor Mitchell, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the University has a unique opportunity to reduce its carbon footprint of because of Los Angeles’s commonly sunny weather.
“USC should adopt solar because we have days like this all year long, and there is this energy out there that can power our planet,” Mitchell said.
The protest began at the Annenberg Amphitheater as dozens of students convened to distribute posters emblazoned with slogans like “USC is Bright, Let’s Use the Light” and “Why Aren’t We Using Our Roofs.” Environmental Core co-directors Ethan Bialick and Zach Manta gave brief speeches detailing the group’s efforts to bring solar panels to the University, as well as the goals of the protest.
“Today we’re coming here with a proposal that literally says this company will pay USC to put solar on these roofs,” Bialick said. “We’re bringing this to them, and we’re going to protest that they need to do this now [and] they need to make a commitment now.”
Demonstrators then marched down Trousdale Parkway, before circling in front of Tommy Trojan. Students, led by Manta, chanted slogans such as “This is the hour for solar power” and “Solar makes sense.” Afterward, students shared their own reasons for why they thought solar power was a top priority for USC.
“I support USC switching to solar because, as a world-class University at a time when renewable is readily available, there is no reason why we should be relying on dirty fossil fuels,” said Olivia Pearson, a freshman majoring in environmental engineering.
After the protest, the Environmental Core presented administration officials with a proposal from the energy company SolarCity to lease USC’s unused rooftops to install solar panels owned and maintained by the company. The University will only need to host the panels and collect the lease payments from Solar City, which will alleviate the financial burden of the solar panels.
“We’ve repeatedly been told by administrators that they’re not willing to put the money down and invest in solar systems because the payback period is too long for their high-risk, high-reward financial strategies,” Manta said. “Although solar does financially make sense, we want to be very clear that this is not primarily a financial decision.”
Bialick hopes that the protest will show the University’s administration that installing solar panels is both socially responsible and financially feasible.
“Ideally, they would recognize that they have a sustainability plan that says they’ll procure renewable energy when economic, and this [proposal] literally pays them to get renewable energy,” Bialick said. “If they refuse this, they’re essentially breaking from what they said.”

Since 2013, USC students have become familiar with the bright orange colors and easy-to-use interface of the Tapingo app, which allows users to order food from numerous venues on and near campus. However, fewer students know they can order from a secret menu at Seeds Marketplace, available only through the app.
Showing up as a bright red asterisk on a white background, the logo of the Seeds Secret Menu directs students to choose from several sausage options that are not available in the usual menu of the Seeds Marketplace. Dishes such as Bavarian Bratwurst, Herb Chicken Basil Sausage and Spicy Orleans Sausage are all available for pickup.
David Corral, assistant director of hospitality for USC Auxiliary Services, said in an email to the Daily Trojan that this decision is due to the desire to attract students to Seeds through the commonly used Tapingo app.
“[The goal] is to create a certain cool factor with our guests and a sense of underground knowledge,” Corral said. “We feel the offerings deliver a different-than-usual menu offering.”
The USC Hospitality team, Corral said, was looking for a way to enhance the student experience beyond the traditional brick-and-mortar presence of the Seeds Marketplace, located in the University Park Campus at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, as well as at the Health Sciences Campus in the Soto Street Building. Seeds focuses on offering artisan salads, sandwiches and on-the-go entrees, as well as healthy snack options for students across both campuses.
“We gave ourselves a challenge of how we can create the best USC experience,” Corral said. “We felt providing a secret menu on the go will deliver on that challenge.”
The Seeds Secret Menu currently offers combo options, which include a drink with the meal for an extra dollar. Alongside this innovation, however, Corral said that there “is a possibility” that further expansion will take place in the future.
“We are always developing new items and new ideas,” Corral said of the Hospitality team.
Though the Seeds Secret Menu is still new and most students are unaware of the options it offers, Corral said that the student response has been largely positive. This is driven, according to Corral, by guests who are “looking for something new,” and finding it at Seeds.

Pedal to the metal · A bike-powered phone charger was one of seven student projects featured at the Corpus Callosum final showing which took place Wednesday evening in the Annenberg Innovation Lab. – Hawken Miller | Daily Trojan
USC Corpus Callosum, a Viterbi School of Engineering student organization that creates projects that combine art and technology, hosted its final showing Wednesday night at the Annenberg Innovation Lab.
Corpus Callosum’s showcase featured seven projects from students whose majors range from mechanical engineering to sculpture. These projects included a phone charging station powered by bicycle, a LED wearable heart rate monitor, a spherical hologram, a video game powered by sound, a feedback system for plants and a brain shaped enclosure that represented both the right and left sides of the brain.
“The first project outside is a geodescent dome model of the brain,” said Linda Xu, events director for Corpus Callosum. “They have these laser lights that they bought online that will project into the left hemisphere of the brain, and it looks very ordered because when you look at it the left hemisphere represents your logical thinking.”
On the other side, students created a more artistic interpretation of the brain by bouncing the lasers off of a reflective surface.
“The right side of your brain is creativity and inventiveness,” Xu said. “So they reflected the lasers onto this aluminum sheet so that when it reflects it is kind of disorganized.”
The diversity of students’ backgrounds and majors represented the vision of the organization to bring art and technology together. It especially reflected the principles of its two founding members — twin alumni Jon and Brendan Dugan.
“We are a club that uses science, technology, engineering and math to make art,” said Lili Lash-Rosenberg, president of Corpus Callosum. “The two students who founded it are two twins, one was a major in mechanical engineering and the other was a major in fine arts.”
After seeing the gap between the fields of engineering and art, the Dugan twins decided that a change needed to be made.
“They noticed that there was a big gap between their two fields and there are actually a lot of similarities between the two,” Lash-Rosenberg said. “In both of them you use what you’ve learned about the world and trial and error and a lot of different testing to create something new.”
Corpus Callosum reflected these founding principles across each project by basing its ideas off an artistic thesis. One project that especially adhered to these principles was the display of the video game that uses sound input for play.
“Our idea was started just with the idea of something audiovisual,” said Zach Lower, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration. “What we landed on was a game that used entirely sound as its input.”
The project creators hope to continue to make their designs more streamlined and applicable. The Bio Pet project hopes to combine both technology and botany to monitor life information of potted plants to better inform owners of care.
“We wanted to give a plant an extra voice to communicate with humans,” said Kevin Prabhakar, a freshman majoring in business administration. “We will hook up a moisture sensor and photoresistor into it, and it will give you readings on how much sunlight is available or how much water is available.”
Bio Pet’s goal is to use social media platforms to show the status of the plant to users real time. The plant will essentially talk to the user, asking for more water or light.
“The next steps are to make it send you a tweet or a text message,” Prabhakar said. “The eventual goal is you can have it outside, hook up a plant to it and, once you find out all the different values, it will send you a tweet every time it needs something.
Part of the draw of the club comes from the fact that it allows students to explore an interdisciplinary approach between completely different majors.
“The club encourages students to think about what’s feasible and then change the design based on what you can actually do in the time that you have as well as the resources,” Lash-Rosenberg said. “It is also important for students to be able to use those skills and work with people of all majors to combine and collaborate to make a product.”

Last month, officials introduced a new California initiative for the November 2016 ballot that would require actors in pornography to wear condoms during sex scenes.
The use of condoms in pornography will entail the promotion of safe and consensual sex, in addition to providing a more realistic perspective on sexual intercourse. Implementing something as simple as condom use will mean a more realistic portrayal of intercourse while ensuring actors of their safety.
This new incentive proposed by Michael Weinstein, president of Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, currently has a 71 percent statewide support. Weinstein explained that he is “very confident that we will be successful on election day.”
If passed, the measure will necessitate all performers in adult films to use condoms during sexual intercourse while filming, in addition to requiring producers to pay for actors’ vaccinations, testing and medical examinations linked to sexually transmitted infections. Those who violate the bill will be fined up to $70,000. Not only will this be a win for Weinstein and the state of California, but it will also be a liberating step forward for those currently in the adult film industry.
Currently, performers are accountable for their own testing and must pay out of their own pockets. While they are required to get tested, this does not mean actors are safe from STDs. Cameron Adams, a former porn actress who became HIV positive while in the industry in 2013, explained at the “Safer Sex” Act Press conference in September that “testing doesn’t prevent infections.”
Sofia Delgado, a past performer who also became HIV positive in 2013, also mentioned at the conference that “condoms are the best protection for performers, but producers refuse to provide them.”
Producers of adult films do give actors the choice in deciding whether or not they would like to use a condom; however, producers display an oppressive nature towards actors by manipulating or pressuring them into not using condoms.
In an interview facilitated by AntiPornography.org, a nonprofit organization, ex-porn performer Marianna Luft, formerly known as “Neesa” in the industry, explained that actors would generally be treated better if they choose not to use a condom. Those in favor of using a condom would typically be viewed by producers as not as valuable, especially to the company running the production.
In Luft’s 10-year experience as a performer, STDs were very prevalent, just as they are today. And though she was tested every 30 days, that didn’t keep her safe, as she contracted many infections anyway.
While the initiative reaps obvious benefits, the porn industry plans to rally in opposition of it, “arguing that there are already testing programs for HIV,” said Diane Duke, chief executive of the Free Speech Coalition. Though true, with HIV testing happening regularly — every 14 days — the measure will come “after nearly two dozen adult performers became HIV-infected while working in the industry between 2004 and 2014.”
What Duke fails to recognize is the fact that the use of condoms will promote safe and consensual sex, as well as a realistic view on sexual intercourse.
Also in an interview facilitated by AntiPornography.org, Ashley L., a current performer who wishes to remain anonymous when supporting condoms in porn to avoid any ostracizing, harassment, and potential loss of work, says that condoms would implement a significant change to the industry. There is an “increasing trend of STDs rising in places where there’s more consumers [of porn],” including exposure to HIV.
Ashley believes that by normalizing the use of condoms in the industry, people outside of porn will emulate the act of safe and consensual sex while preventing STDs on an international scale.
“What we do in porn tends to be what people try to emulate,” she said. If consumers are exposed to consistent use of condoms, they will definitely set a standard in terms of safer and consensual sex.
The use of condoms in the industry will give consumers realistic expectations. This small but significant change means that many people partaking in sexual intercourse within the industry won’t be getting sick anymore. In addition, Ashley explained that using condoms in adult films would help reduce the stigma outside of pornography.
Ultimately, this issue remains relevant in today’s society and culture. Focusing on the use of condoms will only prompt a positive change in the way sex is portrayed and seen, and will advocate for a proactive mindset towards sexual protection.

In the wake of recent demands from a Princeton student group, the Black Justice League, to rename the Woodrow Wilson residential college and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy and International Affairs, some Princeton students have demanded protections for free speech. In their petition, the Black Justice League has demanded that Princeton’s administration “publicly acknowledge the racist legacy of Woodrow Wilson,” institute “cultural competency training for all staff and faculty,” require “classes on the history of marginalized peoples” and put in place “a cultural space on campus dedicated specifically to Black students.” In response, a petition on Change.org, started by “Concerned Princetonians,” claims that these and other demands made by the Princeton Black Justice League represent “historical revisionism” and an imposition of the “Black Justice League’s unilateral narrative upon all graduates through the conduit of the core curriculum.” Though it is true that the commemoration of individuals places their values on a pedestal, progressive leaders from the past should be respected. Woodrow Wilson advanced progressive causes, and should be remembered and revered for doing so.
The Princeton Black Justice League attests that the racist legacy of Woodrow Wilson is harmful to Princeton students, and that “the way we lionize legacies set [sic] precedents.” Though paying respect to a legacy confers attention and infers acceptance of that legacy, Woodrow Wilson’s legacy is far more beneficial than harmful when viewed in its totality. But the Black Justice League overlooks Wilson’s tenure as the president of Princeton University, governor of New Jersey and president of the United States, as well as his commitment to international cooperation among all people. Moreover, it ignores Wilson’s progressive ideals. He ensured that black soldiers received the same pay as white soldiers. He also appointed Louis Brandeis, the first Supreme Court Justice of Jewish descent, who later went on to expand the rights to freedom of speech and privacy. He endorsed the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. Finally, Wilson received the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize for sponsoring the League of Nations, the predecessor to the United Nations. Each one of these achievements is respectable, and the fact that one man managed to not only be elected Commander-in-Chief, but also championed all of these progressive policies, is  worthy of commemoration and respect.
However, the Princeton Black Justice League would like to deny Woodrow Wilson the commemoration he rightfully deserves. It does this because it alleges he was racist and inspired a racist legacy. It must be admitted that Wilson was a segregationist. However, his beliefs and policies were not oppositional to black interests if viewed through the lens of Wilson’s contemporaries. Indeed, he was well ahead of his time, intensely progressive and did much to establish and protect individual liberties and civil rights. Some may argue that he did not do enough, but considering that the legal doctrine of segregation would not be dismantled for another 34 years after he left office, it is not surprising that he supported segregation.
If the metric for demanding the end to a leader’s commemoration is a belief in segregation, then the Princeton Black Justice League must add another president to its list of objectionable men: Abraham Lincoln. Contrary to popular belief, Abraham Lincoln did not believe in the equality of white and black people. Indeed, according to some historians, during his time as president, he preferred that freed slaves be sent to Africa rather than stay in the United States and become citizens. Under the Black Justice League’s logic, buildings named in honor of Abraham Lincoln, must be renamed in order to reflect racial sensitivity, too.
The Princeton Black Justice League does Woodrow Wilson a great disservice by overlooking his contributions to the United States and the world. If the Princeton Black Justice League wants to pursue a revision of core course curriculum and the establishment of a safe space for black students on campus, it is its right to do so. As students, they ought to have their voice heard on such issues. The members of the Black Justice League must, however, be aware of the precedent that they set when they make tarnishing the memory of a great man through contextually incorrect assertions their primary objective.
What the editors appear not to know is that racism WAS one of Woodrow Wilson’s progressive contributions.
His progressive view, shared with Planned Parenthood’s Margaret Sanger, was that abortion would rid the world of an inferior race and certain pregnancies signaling an infant born with birth defects.
This view is part and parcel of the progressives’ dream of a utopian society, and as all utopias are won, done through coercion and brutal government force and losses of individual liberty.

The USG Senate’s rejection of the referendum and Syrian refugees resolutions on Tuesday was a significant moment in the history of USC’s student government. By refusing to transfer its delegated powers to the broader student body and deciding not to endorse a resolution on an issue USG is not qualified to meddle in, the Senate did two things — it established itself as a check on the Executive Branch and Program Board, and it set down the principle that USG has limited rather than expansive powers that do not extend over certain domains, such as national and international politics.
Plenty of people, of course, are unhappy with the Senate’s resounding vetoes of the two resolutions. In particular, members of the Executive Branch and certain Program Board Assemblies (who have a tacit alliance based on common social agendas) do not want restrictions on their power to program events and make statements in support of their broader agendas. The Senate now rises as a potential obstructionary force with review power over both the Executive Branch and Program Board. And had the referendum resolution passed and the USG Constitution were amended to allow the student body to vote directly on issues affecting them, it would have informally empowered the Executive Branch and Program Board — they would thereby have a means of circumventing Senate opposition to their platforms.
So the Senate voted, essentially, to preserve its sovereignty as a check on the power of the Executive Branch and Program Board.
Those of us with a passion for the “science” of government in a free society (to use an old-fashioned term) ought to thank the activists in USG’s Executive Branch and Program Board for pushing their agenda and prompting a Senatorial response — they have brought questions of deepest political significance to the fore in student government, and transformed USG’s senate from a rubber-stamp club to a forum for debates on the nature of mankind, the separation of powers, and the proper ends of government — topics hotly contested in a musty room in Philadelphia over two centuries ago.
This great conflict of interests, ideas and personalities will doubtless continue next semester, featuring redoubled efforts on the part of the Executive-PB coalition to circumvent the Senate’s obstruction and redoubled resolve on the part of the Senators to consolidate and institutionalize their newfound strength. With the next USG elections approaching, and with the pitched battles in USG highlighting the fact that student government is indeed an important and noble calling, we should expect a newfound interest in USG among the student body, perhaps manifested in more candidates for USG positions. They have seen this last semester that, in student government, really important things are at stake.
So before criticizing President Rini Sampath, Sen. Sabrina Enriquez and the activist segments of Program Board, or condemning Senators Eric Dubbery, Aaron Rifkind and Giuseppe Robalino, please consider, dear reader, the following: Before this semester, USG was an occasional curiosity that did some good things, but was generally regarded as nothing to be proud of or take seriously. Now, the great debates of our time ring through the halls of Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Regardless of which side you stand on (and I am partial to the senators) you must thank the leaders of both sides for fighting the good fight and making things interesting. The leaders of tomorrow are being trained right here at USC, cutting their teeth on each other. And regardless of the political causes involved, that’s a good thing.

The Los Angeles Times reported last week that non-tenure track faculty are moving forward with plans to unionize at USC. In addition to highlighting the plight of the average professor at USC, the article also shed light on the impact of the national attack on tenure here on campus.
Five thousand of USC’s 6,600 professors are non-tenure track. That proportion is on the high end for elite universities. These faculty members, despite teaching classes at all levels — from introductory to advanced — do not receive the same kind of job security or wages as their non-tenure counterparts. Certainly, non-tenured faculty at USC have better wages than similar faculty members at most other institutions around the U.S., but the lack of job security and the struggle to make “ends meet,” as Professor Kate Levin put it, strain these professors. Professors need job security and a sufficient salary to live in Southern California comfortably enough to do their jobs sufficiently.
There has been a troubling attack on tenure at universities across the U.S. in recent years. Tenured faculty are paid more and enjoy lifetime appointments, allowing these academics the freedom to research and write without fear of retribution, in case their research leads to politically or religiously sensitive conclusions. This means tenured faculty can openly and honestly advance human understanding. From Socrates to Galileo to countless others, academics have been and continue to be targeted for expanding human understanding. Tenure allows academics to be insulated from attacks based on their research conclusions. Quite simply, it advances human understanding.
However, the University too often prioritizes the bottom line. Cutting tenure positions is a good method for universities to cut costs. Moving to non-tenured faculty, as USC has done, allows universities to exercise more control over faculty and salaries. Students will still enroll, pay tuition and learn, and some faculty will still have the freedom to research and write openly, but the costs will be significantly lower.
This move away from tenure strikes against the very raison d’être of a university. Universities are judged by their ability to generate research and new knowledge. Schools are not judged seriously by the strength of their sports teams, yet nationally the top paid administrators often oversee sports programs, and it is no different at USC. Institutions of higher learning exist to bring academics together and give them an opportunity to advance their fields, train them to assist with the research and carry the torch when their time comes. If faculty members do not have the job security necessary to honestly teach the next generation, then the system falls apart.
Faculty at USC, even the non-tenure track faculty, have almost all displayed a desire to conduct original research in their fields. With the exception of professors of the practice, USC professors have doctorate degrees, meaning they have already contributed to their field. They got into the field, went through doctorate programs and conducted original research because they are passionate about the subject and are advancing our understanding in the area. If they had simply wanted to teach and not research, they could have saved themselves time, hassle and financial burden by forgoing the Ph.D and taking a job at a local high school.
It is clear that USC already cares about research at certain levels — promotional materials  brag about the ability that undergraduates have to research with faculty, and we maintain strong Ph.D programs that give stipends to the next generation of academics while they write, learn and immerse themselves in their fields. We need to continue these valuable strides toward original research by continuing to tenure faculty at this University. We already have trained, qualified academics — we now need to give them the security, salary and prestige required to research and write in their fields. We don’t need to train new professors — we have experienced ones on payroll already.
Unionization cannot replace the benefits of tenure. But hopefully, it will improve the lives of USC professors and allow administrators to see the light. Tenure is the solution to a better University.
Unionization is a discriminatory special interest sold as social justice, or if you really have a lot of chutzpah, as justice.
Union advocates point to how unions barred child labor.  Left unsaid was that most child labor was wonderful — in a time when every member of the family was expected to contribute to the whole.  Children working side-by-side with parents, given small tasks leading to bigger responsibilities, teaching the value of a nickel.  Family working together for a common cause, growing closer, provoking understanding.  Plus families needed the income.
When unions eliminated child labor, the children — some of them orphans and living on the street, but also including many with families to help support — were forced into child prostitution at ages as young as 8.  Or to starve.
That is a legacy of unions.
Great article. Why has tuition exploded? A HUGE rise in administration numbers and costs. Students should demand that adminstration be radically reduced at USC and that they aim to make X% of courses taught by tenured or tenure-track professors in a couple of years. USC students are being ripped off and Nikias and co. think that USC is a business and not a learning community.
Tuition rises as government grows.  As government ‘guarantees” loans — without requiring that universities be accountable for what universities provide and knowing students have little reason to complain (government is guaranteeing the tuition) — universities raise tuition rates.
Yes, administration numbers have grown as a consequences, but it is not the cause.  The guarantees came first and caused them to grow.
Hence, the trillion-plus dollar student debt bubble for which we await explosion under Democratic leadership.
1) We have Republican leadership in the House and Senate. They’ve done nothing about it. I have also not seen anything from the Republican contenders. If you are conservative as I think you probably are, it’s not going to make your side look good to make it a partisan issue.
2) There is no causative mechanism between loans and the growth in administration. Growth in administration has a lot better correlation with ticket price than does student loans.
3) Agree something has to be done about student loans and about affordability. Democrats have to do more than simply throw more loans out there, Republicans have to do better than simply attacking access.
4) Tying federal money to student debt, % of tenure or tenure-track faculty etc might be part of a viable alternative plan.
Yes, I’d describe myself as conservative but not Republican.  I find much with which to agree with you.
Taking your points one-by-one:
1)  There is little to be done by Republicans to interfere with the existing private contractual loan responsibilities between university and student.  It’s America.  USC is a private institution.  Students are private citizens.  Government should not be guaranteeing loans.
2)  It seems you agree with me here.
3)  If there is anything to be done about the student loan bubble, it would be to end the government subsidies.  Because much of the more than $1 trillion in outstanding loans is federally guaranteed, taxpayers are on the hook for repayment if (i.e. when) the borrowers default.  
4)  I very much like that idea!  (But I’d like to see the elimination of tenure based on seniority — a whole other discussion.  It is biased in favor of leftist faculty (who retain each other up to the tenure date) and keeps the percentage of them at nearly 100%, which does not serve our children and destroys diversity of ideas.

Hannah Luk | Daily Trojan
A group of students at the University of California, Berkeley created a White Student Union Facebook page Nov. 21, initially promoted to serve as a “safe space” for white students to voice their opinions and stories regarding “the challenges that European-American students on college campuses face,” according to the page. The page has since been deleted due to overwhelming backlash.
With recent conversations surrounding race on college campuses — such as the football strike sparked by racial tension at University of Missouri, as well as similar issues that gained media attention at Yale University and Claremont McKenna College — students of all racial backgrounds seem to have an opinion as to what constitutes racism. And though it is people of color who have endured the harshest discrimination in this country, it seems that white Americans can’t handle the criticism they’ve faced within the last few years.
The UC Berkeley White Student Union was not a sanctioned group that obtained university approval; in fact, university officials condemned the creation of this group. The university issued a statement written by UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks and Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion Na’ilah Suad Nassir, which stated, “While UC Berkeley honors First Amendment rights, we do not endorse this attempt to create conflict and make light of the efforts of activists, locally and nationally, who have worked hard to hold us all accountable for providing a campus climate where every student is safe, welcomed and respected.”
Though it is surprising that this group emerges from one of the most liberal college campuses in America, the UC Berkeley White Student Union isn’t the only white student group that has been established on a college campus; White Student Unions were also created at Stanford University, Penn State, UCLA and University of Missouri, among others across the country. However, most of these pages have since been erased. And while the UC Berkeley White Student Union was still active, the group stated on its Facebook page that any language deemed derogatory, prejudiced or racially insensitive would be automatically deleted. However, regardless of the creators’ intentions to ensure that discussions would remain diplomatic, the entire principle of creating a White Student Union is racist in itself.
There is a strange contradiction that accompanies the ideologies of white privilege; white Americans who don’t believe white privilege exists think so because they’ve never had to face the struggles of Americans of color. In general, white Americans do not have to think about how their race affects their social, political and economic status because most Western societies have deemed Caucasians to be the preferred race. For centuries, this country has been led by white politicians, so it is confusing how white Americans can experience racial injustice.
There is a difference between racism and prejudice. Though the two often go together, white privilege disables the implication of racism among white Americans. America was built on the principles of colonialism and racism from white Europeans; prior to the establishment of slavery in the 17th century, it was indigenous Americans who faced the bloodshed of Anglo-Saxon immigrants in the 15th century. If one were to express negative generalizations toward all the European-American citizens, though these comments would be in bad taste, it would, fundamentally, not be racist — because the United States was built from a Eurocentric perspective, and because the United States is still predominantly run by white men. One technically cannot be racist against white Americans, for they still maintain power in the country.
It would, however, be incorrect and rather critical to assume that all white Americans hold racist beliefs. There are, of course, many white Americans who advocate for equality among all races and have joined the frontier to eliminate all racial prejudices. However, those who believe in the principles of true racial equality yet choose to stay silent in situations of discrimination or microaggressions are contributing to the problem. Silence does not always equal neutrality; in the case of racism in America, silence is, in fact, violently detrimental to progress.
If white Americans are tired of enduring the anger of Americans of color, they must first acknowledge their social, economic and political privilege and actively strive to achieve equality between all races by speaking up in situations of racial injustice. One cannot change history, but one can change where the future is headed. It is up to millennials to change the norms of racial perception and create justice for racial minorities in America.
The question isn’t whether white students NEED a white student union.  It is whether progressives will ever recognize that people have rights, and that rights need never be justified.
Good article (from a white, well-off, cisgendered man)
I am not white.
But I am.
(I appreciate that my original comment could be read both ways. Apologies.)
Let me give you some perspective:
There is a strange contradiction that accompanies the ideologies of Collegiate Social Justice Warriors; Collegiate Social Justice Warriors who believe white privilege exists think so because they’ve never lived their life from a white person’s.
Now, of course there are aspects of white privilege that need to be acknowledged but by your logic, you have no grounds to make that claim. Only white people do. Kinda funny, eh? 
Look. To claim that any group or race is incapable of understanding the struggles inherent in and particular to members of another group or race is another interesting position. By this logic it is would be impossible for anyone to human beings to empathize with and evaluate the claims of their brothers and sisters across barriers of time, culture, and identity group. I implore you to explore this denial of the possibility of commonly understood literary, intellectual, and human experiences, at least if one does not share the gender, socioeconomic status, and race of a book’s author or of one’s interlocutor. Are you saying that only white people are able to fully understand and identify with Shakespeare’s stories? 
rac·ism – prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race
What you are saying literally matches the dictionary definition of racism. Please check your minority privilege.  You are making me all to aware of my lack of ability to participate in any discussion on race in America and it is #triggering. Please help us maintain the #safespace on our beautiful campus.
Adam. Time to grow up and be an adult. You do not live at home anymore, you live on a university campus that is not a day care center for emotionally sensitive kids. It is not the real world either, so you are somewhat coddled, but it’s time to cut the apron strings and be responsible for yourself and how YOU interact with society and how YOU educate yourself and move forward in life.  Your use of white privilege or whatever you want to use as an excuse for you not being personally responsible for your life is just another indication that you are not ready for university life.  Perhaps you should quit school, move back home and grow u, maybe take some classes at the local community college. 
Your assumptions about me and my background are indicative that you are the racist, as you know nothing about me or my background.
You’re indoctrinated, Adam.  I find that when this happens, engaging in dialogue is like teaching a rock to speak.
You social justice nazis are tyrannical authoritarians on a destructive path to destroy America. Everyone is sick of you racist and sexist shit-stirrers. You openly justify your racism against whites by using some bullshit magical-unicorn definition of racism you made up where its somehow impossible to be racist against whites, because ‘those evil white people deserve it’.
You are the the racist. You should feel ashamed for how horrible of a person you are. In a few years, after you social justice nazis have been totally defeated and laughed out of existence, you will realize that you have become the monster you claim to fight. You are the racist, hateful bigot, not the common white man.
This is arguably the most unlettered thing that I have read on the internet. Well done, sir. Well done indeed.
And by the way, since when did universities and colleges become day care for teens and adults. The “safe space”  issue is a joke.
Well, that is certainly true.   It’s the progressives’ version of ugly “separate but equal”.
You kids are emotionally messed up by perpetuating all this racially motivated deceitful pressure on everyone to think the way you want them to think. Thought control, being politically correct, and  use of 1st Amendment rights by allowing one group to express themselves and others to not, is completely contrary to our values as Americans, and is jnconstutional.   You have set b a c the advances of racial discourse 50 years and MLK would be not a proponent of your efforts to wreak havoc in the lives of peaceful folks.  
Why aren’t you writing about the illegal it is of the exercise of presidential power by the POTUS? Or the mismanagement of water by your political representatives in Sacto, for they are the cause of the water shortage by allowing 100s of billions of gallons of fresh water to flow into the Pacific Ocean?  Or Benghazi, Fast and Furious gun running, IRS being used as a attack dog by the President? That was one of the issues that was used to impeach President Nixon?  How about writing about how the Black Lives Matter movement is all about creating racial tensions in America with the goal to incite rioting? Do you know who funds that organization? Or the New Black Panther Party?  Do some research.   You’ll find all sorts of anti American interests funding and organizing these groups, as proxies, for their plans to destroy the American way of life.
Young people today will not be living in a free society tomorrow if you let this behavior continue.
Merry Christmas too. 
Please tell us more. It is fascinating to read your posts.  I find them quite interesting and the more you post, the easier it is to differentiate your views from the rest of the USC community.
Racism is racism, no matter which direction it comes from. If there are Black Student Unions, Asian Student Unions, etc., then there should be no problem with White Student Unions. 
As a working-class white woman, I never experienced the so-called “white privilege’ that is being spoken about. Whatever I’ve accomplished in life was due to my own effort. 
The only way we’re going to significantly reduce racism is to stop making it the centerpiece of our lives. Everyone is different; we’re all individuals, and skin color is part of that. As MLK said-it’s time to “judge people not by their skin color, but the content of their character”. That goes for all races.
This isn’t true. You DO have privilege as a white woman. You’d have more if you were male and came from a well-off background (like I do), but you do have privilege nonetheless. The “black” you would have had a harder road to walk. Only an idiot wouldn’t be able to see this.
My question is why is a Black Student Union not mentioned anywhere in this post?

Director Noah Baumbach’s latest film is a much-needed improvement from his last disappointment, While We’re Young. Baumbach punctuates his new film Mistress America with an offbeat sense of humor that will inspire laughs throughout the audience. The film tells a story with painful accuracy and perception. The greatest part, however, is that the quick 126 minute movie runs like a play. The dialogue is quick, tight and read with impeccable timing from the cast.
Mistress America tells the story of Tracy (Lola Kirke), who experiences an unconventional first semester at Barnard College. Tracy’s first few weeks at college are every freshman’s nightmare. She struggles to make friends, get good grades and, most importantly, gain acceptance into a prestigious literary writing group. Just as Tracy becomes the loneliest sob story ever seen, she gets a call from Brooke (Greta Gerwig), the 30-something daughter of the man Tracy’s mom is about to marry. Tracy immediately finds herself enthralled by Brooke’s charm, as Brooke is the exact person one would expect to enter a boring protagonist’s life. She is more than life itself, catching everyone’s attention as she walks by.
Brooke provides the film with its quick wit and laughs, yet also highlights the dimensionality needed in movie characters. She didn’t need college apparently, as she is an autodidact trying to start a restaurant in honor of her dead mother. Before the waterworks start, keep in mind that Brooke is ruthlessly selfish. Her dreams are as big as New York City, but she shows no sign of being scared of failing. The best scene is when a girl from Brooke’s high school appears at the bar and stands up to Brooke after years of torment. Brooke shows no remorse and hurls insults.
Inspired by the incident, Tracy uses Brooke as her new subject to write on for her reapplication to the literary club. Though Tracy isn’t proud about writing slanderous thoughts in her short story about Brooke, she needs to prove herself as a college student who is just not doing “enough.” Tracy earns the envy of the passively competitive fellow literary reject, Tony (Matthew Shear). The story gets heated when Brooke, Tracy, Tony and Tony’s girlfriend take a road trip to Connecticut to visit Brooke’s old lover and best friend (now married) in order to ask them for money to invest in her restaurant. There could not be a more obvious set up for drama. However, writers — and real-life couple — Gerwig and Baumbach keep the dialogue so accurate for a 2015 audience that the theater was practically shaking from laughter.
This is because the film has heart at its core, but satire is its skin and bones. Brooke is a snapshot of the millennial generation. She floats from dream to dream without ever following through with one of her brilliant ideas. To embody this mentality, Brooke claims she is inflicted with an “unnamed illness” that causes her to lay in bed and watch television all day. It is an excellent observation of the younger generation of people. Additionally, Gerwig brings the other half of a satirical character besides the truth — humor. She is simply hilarious. She delivers her lines like the expert she is, and when the camera is just on her face, she commands it. Her presence is absolute dynamite. However, she does make room for newcomer Kirke. Kirke’s character is the other half of millennials — lonely, entitled and unapologetic for her actions.
Overall, Baumbach’s direction is masterful and has achieved a near-perfect movie. Mistress America is the film that America needs to successfully capture the spirit of millennials.

Never go out of style · Singer Taylor Swift performs in Shanghai last month. With the release of Swift’s latest album, 1989, late last year, the singer is in the running for Grammy nominations, especially Record of the Year. – Photo courtesy of Big Machine Records
The long-awaited nominations for this year’s Grammy Awards will be released Dec. 7. The big questions surrounding the announcement are who will rack up the nominations and who will get snubbed. Strong predictions are already being made, especially for the five most popular categories: Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance, Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best New Artist.
Taylor Swift will, without a doubt, lead the nominations. She’s had a killer year with the release of her fifth studio album, 1989. Not only is she a strong contender for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, but the song “Blank Space” also blew up on the radiowaves, and the music video amassed over a billion views. That’s no easy feat, and “Blank Space” will most likely get nods for Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance. In recent years, Swift has received a slew of nominations but been snubbed at the awards ceremony, so hopefully this year she has a chance to take home trophies for a job well done.
Record of the Year is another popular category that will face some strong competition. The Weeknd’s “Can’t Feel My Face” and Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud” will likely get nods. However, “Uptown Funk” by Mark Ronson and ft. Bruno Mars is a song that might win this category this year, as it stayed relevant on the radio for quite some time.
Drake, Nicki Minaj, Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole and Dr. Dre are expected to lead in the category for Best Rap Album, and Lamar should most definitely receive an Album of the Year nomination for To Pimp a Butterfly. The Compton rapper received what was considered a huge affront two years ago when he lost Best Rap Album to Macklemore. This year, it would be an incredible snub if he lost again.
After winning the Academy Award and Golden Globe for “Glory,” it could almost be considered an insult if Common and John Legend didn’t take home the trophy for Song of the Year. They do have some amazing competition, though: “Blank Space” may sneak in another nomination, and Rachel Patten’s “Fight Song” has been one of the female anthems of the year. Additionally, Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth’s touching ballad, dedicated to late actor Paul Walker, pulls at the heartstrings — “See You Again” may be able to take it all.
Lastly, “Best New Artist” has always been a nail-biting category, as the artists who win are most definitely the best in the business. A nod to Meghan Trainor would be expected, as her first album Title debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and broke records as Epic Records’ first
No. 1 album since Sara Bareilles’s 2010 album, Kaleidoscope Heart. On the other hand, Fetty Wap has blown up the airwaves with “Trap Queen” and “My Way,” and might be able to snatch the trophy from bubbly blonde princess Trainor.
The 58th Annual Grammy Awards Ceremony will be held on Feb. 15, 2016.
Adele in 2017?
INDEED!!! She’ll probably have 20 nominations one in EVERY CATEGORY!!!!
I wish the new album from Drake, Dr. Dre’s “Compton”, Nicki Minaj’s “Pinkprint” and Kendrick Lamar’s new album will win jointly at 58thGrammys for Best Rap Album.
I wish the song from The Weeknd, “Can’t Feel the Face” will win at 58th Grammy Awards for Record of the Year.
I wish the song, “Glory” from the film, “Selma” will win for Song of the Year. #GoodLuck for #JohnLegendand #Common for winning a Grammy trophy.

Jet lagged and unable to lift my head from exhaustion, I asked the barista for a coffee. He looked perplexed and kindly asked how I would like the coffee prepared. I learned from then on that in Australia, the word “coffee” is virtually meaningless without futher instructions, such as flat white, black tea latte, etc. This is a custom extremely different from back home in the United States.
Even the most common activities — ordering daily coffee, going to the market — are unfamiliar. Everything is alien and uncrossed — ultimate sink-or- swim territory.
Trusting oneself across continents, especially while alone, can be daunting. Despite how concrete I felt in my decision to study abroad, I would be lying if I said I didn’t have doubts. Fear of discomfort is probably the most prominent among them, as well as the perpetual fear of being lonely. However, these fears were ephemeral, unable to change my desire to spend the semester abroad.
Before I even began attending USC, I knew I wanted to study abroad. I always had profound wanderlust. Planes, trains and automobiles excite me, as I see them as doorways to new experiences. To say I am addicted to traveling is an understatement. My parents attribute this desire to my inability to sit still.
My favorite part of traveling is probably listening to new languages. Before my semester in Melbourne, I wavered greatly in deciding if I was willing to give up the experience of learning a new language. Luckily, the exchange provided several benefits. Little did I know, Melbourne is the epicenter of converging cultures in Australia. In almost every way, the city is international. With each turn, my ears caught on to conversations in five different languages.
That sacrifice, though, was just one of the many made for studying abroad. For one, I feel the pain of missing football season. I’ve struggled with homesickness for the first time. Mostly, I’ve missed the comfort afforded by being around things that are familiar.
A semester abroad also comes with missing a semester of activity on campus. I had to give up active roles in organizations and postpone pursuing leadership positions, all of which are critical elements in applying for future degrees and jobs.
There is an unfortunate generalization about studying abroad: A semester abroad is one of an easy workload and lots of partying. When I did decide to apply, advisers urged me to take the semester abroad seriously. I took that advice to heart in choosing the classes I would take in order to fully appreciate studying at an Australian university. I took that on in opportunities to push myself out of my comfort zone.
During my time here, I have, as cliché as it sounds, formed lasting friendships and memories, some of which will transcend our geographical distance. I feel that my life has been enhanced by them and is almost unimaginable without them. And there is no denying that others feel the same way.
Before coming to Melbourne, I prided myself on my understanding of coffee, gravitating toward specific flavors and avoiding those that have burnt beans. Unable to simply ask for a coffee when first arriving embarrassed me, as suddenly something I was so certain about became lost. I won’t lie and say studying abroad is easy,  because it highlights how even the most basic activity, like having a coffee, can be difficult.
When I first ordered a coffee properly, I sent a picture of my successful order, reveling in my advancement as a coffee connoisseur. The embarrassment evaporated as I became more comfortable asking questions and learning from others. I think of coffee, as weird as it sounds, to highlight discomfort. Conquering the daily activities, though, shows that it’s possible to adjust. Each time I left Melbourne to travel, the return felt just like I was coming home.
While taking a road trip across the east coast of Australia in a rather ridiculous hippie van, I read an oxymoron that confused me at first: “Traveling leaves you speechless, turns you into a storyteller.” In a way I feel that dichotomy almost completely describes my experience abroad. So many moments have moved me, shook me to my core, left me unable to find words to describe just how I have felt about it. Simultaneously though, these experiences made me a narrator, as I continually find myself sharing my stories.

With finals season rapidly approaching, students need to buckle down and study. But with fun parties on the Row and all the attractions of L.A., it can be hard not to jump in the car and ride off to Disneyland instead of reading the study guide your TA so graciously prepared. Many students have different ways of studying, but there are a few places on campus where everyone should be able to get some work done.
USC Libraries
It’s typical, but you should have already known that this would make the top of the list. It’s quiet, you can bring your snacks in and, more importantly, you can work. There are many of libraries at USC, so you can take your pick in figuring out which one feels the most like home to you.
Ronald Tutor Campus Center
Yes, it might get noisy, but maybe that’s where you shine. Students who like working in groups can meet at the campus center, grab a bite to eat at one of the many food options and study together. Even students who don’t like to study in groups but are totally OK with the bustling activities surrounding the center can grab a table and color code those notes.
Literatea
Undoubtedly, Doheny Memorial Library is one of the most beautiful and Instagrammable spots on campus — both the exterior and interior of the building. Tucked in the back of Doheny is Literatea, a cafe with ample supplies of good tea and coffee. The space is quite small, however, so those who need to spread out can soak up some sun in the courtyard directly outside.
McCarthy Quad
There are so many bare lawns throughout campus. USC boasts about having campus-wide Wi-Fi, so take advantage of that by spreading out across the grass and typing up that last research paper you have to do. Some students like being outside and not confined to a desk in order to get their work done.
Your dorm room
There are some students who don’t do well studying around other people. They feel more comfortable relaxing on their beds with their notes spread out or working at their own desks. If you are one of these people, don’t feel like you have to go to campus to study if that’s not your thing. Get some snacks and coffee and do your work in the comfort of your own room.
Ground Zero
Known for two things, their milkshakes and great selection of music, Ground Zero turns off its music during study days to create a better study environment. Feel free to study in this large space without loud distractions. Of course, grabbing a milkshake is also essential.
Taper Hall
Sometimes the best place to study is the environment we as students are in the most: the classroom. Taper Hall classrooms are open to students during study days. Taper is a great place to rally a group of classmates to go over study material. Or, study in a big room by yourself.

For a recent “day in the life” video, our multimedia director asked me how I would describe my job, suggesting I say something about being the leader. Instead I told her I was a shepherd herding cats.
Those of you who pick up the Daily Trojan each morning — or even just once in awhile — probably don’t realize exactly how much goes into that paper. And more than just that paper, there’s also our website to manage, our online blogs and multimedia, our longer-term projects and more. Which means that there’s often a lot of stray thoughts on my mind — this Tuesday, for instance, everything from a caption that got posted wrong online, to our semesterly tea with President Nikias that afternoon, to entries for the annual California College Media Association awards.
What I’m often not worrying about, though, are the sections. That’s because I have such great editors. As editor-in-chief, one of my proudest moments was when, around halfway through the semester, I realized I was unnecessary. Yes I do things for the paper, but if need be, my staff is so efficient and well-versed in their jobs, they could produce the paper themselves. 
To some extent, I am here to direct my staff. But a lot of my job is really just serving them in whatever way I can. Whether answering questions, reassuring them, helping them when things fall through or giving them story and editing advice, my job is not to make this paper, but rather to make sure everyone else can. 
As the semester comes to a close, I’m proud of my tenure at the Daily Trojan for a few reasons. I accomplished many things on my platform, we put out some great stories and, all-in-all, nightly production has run smoothly. But I’m most proud of how great everyone’s been doing at their jobs. The fact that my workload (and stress level) has significantly lessened as the semester has progressed is a testament to this.
And as the new editors have been inducted into their positions, they’ve also been inducted into something else: the Daily Trojan family. As I leave it — or at least take a step back — I’m happy with whose hands it rests in.
Isabella Sayyah is senior majoring in print and digital journalism, and international relations. She is also editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan.
