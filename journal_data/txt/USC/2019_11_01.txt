“Full House” actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, pleaded not guilty to new bribery charges in Boston federal court Friday. 
Loughlin and Giannulli are among the 11 parents charged with conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery in the college admissions scandal last week after bribing USC employees to admit their children in favored categories and declining to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud before the deadline set by federal prosecutors. 
The bribery charge is the couple’s third superseding indictment based off an FBI investigation released in March that details Newport Beach businessman William “Rick” Singer’s scheme to help wealthy parents pay their children’s way into elite universities such as USC, Stanford and Yale as fake athletic recruits. 
Loughlin and Giannulli paid $500,000 between October 2016 and February 2018 to falsely designate their daughters Isabella and Olivia Jade Giannulli as women’s crew recruits in order to gain them admission to the University. As of last month, neither Isabella Rose nor Olivia Jade was enrolled at USC, the University confirmed in a statement.
According to court documents, the couple bribed former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel to present a falsified athletic recruitment profile of their older daughter Isabella that included a posed photo of Isabella on an ergometer to an admissions committee in October 2016 to gain her admission to the University. The committee approved Isabella Rose’s recruitment, and she was formally accepted to USC in Spring 2017. 
Loughlin and Giannulli repeated the process with younger daughter Olivia Jade the following year, working with Singer and former USC assistant women’s soccer coach Laura Janke to fabricate an athletic profile that presented Olivia Jade as a coxswain recruit. Olivia Jade was approved by an admissions committee as a crew recruit in November 2017 before receiving a formal offer of admission from the University in Spring 2018.
In court Friday, the couple’s attorney also waived their right to appear in court for their Nov. 20 arraignment.
Loughlin and Giannulli are two of 16 USC parents named in the Operation Varsity Blues case. To date, Loughlin and Giannulli have been charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery and conspiracy to commit money laundering. They each face up to 20 years in prison.

Over fall break, I went to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., and watched my younger brother George’s Sprint Football game. For those of you who don’t know what Sprint Football is (I didn’t either until George started playing this year), it’s regular American football — the only difference being that every player on the roster must be 178 pounds or lighter. Only 10 schools play it, and they are all in the Northeast.
The games are incredibly fun to watch. The players, and in turn, the game, moves fast. It’s a varsity sport of its own, not just the JV football team. After the game, the Navy Sprint Football coach didn’t refer to Navy Football, who was playing the next day, as “main football” or “real football.” Rather, he just called them “the big boys,” because there’s no reason for a sport intended for lighter people to be seen as secondary.
In the same vein, sports like wrestling and rowing have weight classes. That’s the detail that made me think back to a situation in my Sports and Social Change class earlier this semester. These two things might not seem related, but bear with me. 
Everyone in the class received a quiz comprised of 10 statements to be marked true or false. All of the statements were multi-faceted and didn’t have a distinct right or wrong answer. The point of the exercise was to open up a class discussion about why we chose the answers we did. 
When we got to the seventh question, the professor, Ben Carrington, read it out loud: “The limited participation by women in sports reflects their biological potential,” the statement read. Carrington instructed the students to raise their hand if they marked it as true, as he had with all the other statements. Out of the class of 91 students, about 10 raised their hand. 
I was really disappointed that that many people agreed. It actually made me sad, and still does, to know that there are people at USC who think that way. I also couldn’t believe that those people weren’t embarrassed to be publicly misogynistic. 
Professor Carrington called on people around the room to explain why they thought the statement was true. One guy volunteered his reasoning and explained that if a girl were to go up against NFL defensive end J.J. Watt, they would get absolutely demolished because Watt is huge. The professor asked the student, who is not a particularly large person, how big Watt is and the student gave an estimate. 
For reference, J.J. Watt is 6-foot-5, 290 lbs. Professor Carrington thought for a moment and said “OK … so what would happen if you went up against J.J. Watt?”
The whole room laughed because the irony was so clear. It’s not just women who would be maimed by a Watt tackle; most adult men on this planet would be, too. 
That’s why a sport like Sprint Football exists — so that small but athletic players have an opportunity. 
Part of the reason for women’s limited participation in sports is not because they’re physically incapable. If we’re using football as a benchmark, the reason is in part because, beyond the middle school level, there is not much opportunity for young women to play. There are women’s football leagues in the U.S., but they are very, very limited. 
Beyond that, there’s a big difference in the way young boys and girls are socialized. Girls are often boxed into less violent sports and activities such as volleyball, gymnastics, cheerleading or dance. There is nothing wrong with any of those, but the emphasis placed on femininity at such an early age has more to do with women’s limited participation in sports than any physiological differences. 
I was lucky enough to grow up in a family where, from a young age, my mom praised my muscular legs. In my various lacrosse collisions, I’d hear my dad yelling from the sidelines “Let ‘em bounce off of you biscuit! You’re bigger than them!” But that’s not the case for every young girl.
Girls grow up hearing derogatory phrases such as “run like a girl” or “hit like a girl” and begin to think they’re physically inferior to men. Even into adulthood, the media sexualizes female athletes and often focuses more on their outfits, attractiveness and love interests than their actual athletic performance. 
The subconscious message is clear: To a certain degree, women’s athletic capabilities aren’t as important or respected as men’s. If we raised young girls by encouraging them to be brave and tough — as we encourage young boys — the psychology would be a lot different. 
In the 1800s, scientists said that because women’s bones are more fragile than men’s, they should not ride bicycles because it would damage their hips and impair their ability to carry children. Of course, none of this was true. It was a way to continue to restrict women using a veil of physiological differences that were not at all substantiated. In thinking critically about topics such as women’s limited participation in sports, let’s try to look at the big picture and try to think more like it’s the 21st century.

People moshed and headbanged at the end of SleezeHog-iversary and Halloween Bash, a concert in the cinderblock-ridden backyard of an L.A. home featuring artists within the genre of its namesake. As the Doc Martens left the venue, the event organizers — known by the name SleezeHog Productions — approached The Groans, a queer punk band of color, to ask them how the show went.
The members voiced their grievances to the SleezeHog team. One of them stepped in dog poop; a noise complaint forced the band to turn down the volume during their set. Of the short list, one complaint stood out:
“They were like, ‘This whole lineup was really white and male, and the crowd was representative of that,’” said Natalie Lee, a founding member of SleezeHog. The Groans continued, expressing how they did not feel very safe in the homogeneous environment and how this treatment was common in their performing experience.
Then, Lee cried.
“As a queer person of color, I took that very much to heart,” said Lee, a senior majoring in music industry. “That’s the last thing I want …  for a marginalized person to feel unsafe and uncomfortable at our shows.”
The organizers had not originally focused on promoting diversity in their lineups, but the values of representation and inclusion mean a lot to the team, Lee expressed. The feedback sparked a newfound dedication to ensure the comfort of both their bands and audience members.
“If we’re going to be the ones throwing these things, we’re going to be the ones who need to make the effort to make the change,” said Emmeline Salazar, a senior majoring in music industry.
From there, the group’s intent was clear. 
The Thornton School of Music’s live music production and promotion class, which is taught by Music Industry chair and assistant professor of practice Michael Garcia, brought SleezeHog into the world in 2018. For their major assignment, the students had to break into groups and throw their own shows, taking care of everything from booking artists and the venue to promoting the show to fill seats — or, in this case, a living room.
Salazar’s group, which included students senior Julia Craig and alumnae Dane Pieper and Emily Schultz came up with Punk-o-ween, a punk house show with a date set for the end of October. Schultz and Pieper have since left SleezeHog. Since the team was not too involved in the local punk community, they brought Lee on to the class project as their “punk liaison.”
“We didn’t want to put on a punk show and just say it’s punk even though it wasn’t,” Salazar said. “We wanted to make sure we stuck with the culture.”
After hours of crowd-surfing, dancing, singing and shopping for clothes courtesy of vendor Good Sport, SleezeHog deemed the night a success.
“People came up to me afterward, and they were like, ‘Thank you, we needed this,’” Lee said. “There’s no other scene around USC where you can just mosh.”
The glowing reactions, as well as another opportunity for a punk-inspired holiday pun, kept SleezeHog kicking beyond their class assignment to host Punk-mas.
“SleezeHog always brings a good crowd of good people that are nice to be around. They don’t tolerate transphobic, racist, homophobic, stupid bullshit like that,” said Gabi Cohen of GUPPY, a band that performed at SleezeHog’s most recent show, SleezeHog-iversary. “You feel confident being in a space where you’re like, ‘Oh, these people are my people, and they all stand up for me, and I want to stand up for and be there for them.’”
Along with actively involving people of color and queer communities, SleezeHog emphasizes booking local bands, uplifting the L.A. music scene and giving smaller artists the space to garner followings.
“It’s just cultivating a culture that everyone can thrive in, whether as a community member, an audience member, a performer, an artist or creator,” said Polartropica, another artist who also took the SleezeHog-iversary stage last Friday.
Being small and scrappy does not mean SleezeHog sacrifices quality. According to multiple bands and audience members, the promoter runs its shows quite smoothly.
“The shows are a DIY feel, but with the professionalism of being at a venue,” said Julia Lebow, another member of GUPPY.
Aside from the bands, SleezeHog’s audience feels equally welcomed and supported when attending the shows. Danielle Haase, a junior majoring in neuroscience, frequents SleezeHog shows she was introduced by a friend.
“It’s definitely a really good source of representation for the queer community and a good outlet for people to come and enjoy music they can relate to,” Haase said.
Support for SleezeHog has only grown since last year’s Punk-o-ween, still one of its most attended shows to date. Beyond punk music, the promoter has branched out to welcome artists of all genres.
“They’re so, so talented,” said Marcus Emery, a senior majoring in animation and digital arts. “I mean like, the fact that they’re able to repeatedly be this good at finding new artists and a diverse group of people to perform, host, showcase their art, whatever … it’s amazing. It’s so impressive, and I’m so proud of them, because they’ve come such a long way.”
And they keep rocking. 
SleezeHog will be hosting its next show, the fifth Queer Night of Expression — a staple event for the crew — at the local gallery space Junior High on Nov. 23. The team also plans to go on tour in the first half of 2020, before donning their gowns and sashes at graduation.
“It’s a class project that hasn’t ended,” Salazar said.

As the end of the season draws near, the No. 7 USC men’s water polo team will face a crucial weekend double-header against No. 1 Stanford and No. 12 San Jose State.
On Saturday’s Senior Day, the Trojans will face top-ranked Stanford for the first time since they bested the Cardinal at the 2018 NCAA Championship. The match also marks the first of the three Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference games the Trojans will play to close the regular season.
Stopping Stanford’s momentum going into the match will undoubtedly be one of USC’s most difficult challenges so far this season, as a narrow win over No. 5 Pepperdine brought the Cardinal’s winning streak to 10 games. Stanford has only beaten the Trojans seven times when they’ve played at USC, but key players on this year’s roster will provide one of the toughest tests yet.
USC’s practices leading up to the match have focused on slowing those standout players. 
“We’re going to continue with watching the games until Saturday,” sophomore 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt said. “And you know, they’re definitely a really good team, they have a great center in [redshirt junior 2-meter] Ben Hallock, and they have some guys on the perimeter that [are] also good players too. So we’re gonna have to get ready and figure out how to play a good game with them.”
Hallock has turned heads with his performance this season, leading the MPSF conference with 48 goals so far. 
Stanford’s defensive foundation is strong, too, with senior goalie Andrew Chun picking up an average of 8.87 saves per game. These players are on the Trojans’ mind, but the Cardinal’s talent does not faze them.
“The whole focus is to play the defense and stop their best players,” head coach Marko Pintaric said. “And obviously [Hallock] is … the backbone of the team that everything surrounds and we have ways to stop [him], and we worked on our options, and we’ll see how that works.”
The game will be preceded by an event to honor the team’s departing players as senior driver Marin Dasic, redshirt junior driver Troy Furniss, redshirt junior utility Luka Karaman, senior 2-meter Matt Maier and redshirt senior 2-meter Sam Slobodien all prepare for their final home games. 
The Trojans won’t have much time to rest, as the weekend’s second matchup against San Jose State takes place the next afternoon. The Spartans will face No. 5 Pepperdine on Saturday before they head to USC. The Trojans are 7-0 all-time against SJSU, and this weekend is purported to be an extension of that streak.
But USC has some improvements to make after a 13-12 loss to the Waves two weekends ago. Sophomore driver Hannes Daube, Ehrhardt and Dasic stepped up, however, with 4, 3 and 2 goals respectively. Freshman driver Chris Sturtevant, redshirt junior driver Luke Wyatt and Maier each tacked on a goal, filling the gap left by junior driver Jacob Mercep’s injury. 
The Trojans did only allow 10 exclusions and sophomore goalie Nic Porter recorded an impressive 13 saves, but a 0.571 power play percentage and a 0.406 shooting percentage along with a third-quarter revival from Pepperdine left the Trojans with another loss on the road. 
Pintaric will plan the starting lineup in anticipation of Mercep’s return and the back-to-back games in a manner that prioritizes the team’s health. 
“It’s a constant communication between all of us to keep players outside of the red zones so they don’t get injured again,” Pintaric said of the game preparations. “So we plan on doing this this weekend and we will try to maximize our success. And at the same time, keep in mind the health of our players.”
The Trojans will take on Stanford Saturday at 1 p.m. and San Jose State Sunday at 1 p.m. Both games will be held at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

I interviewed an almost-prince for “You Should Stan” this week. Well, kinda.
During the Los Angeles stop of Hoodie Allen’s tour “Whatever USA Phase One,” I sat down with rapper-turned-pop-hunk Jake Miller to chat about his newest musical transformation and about the royal Disney role he almost got.
I first learned about Miller a few years ago, when Fifth Harmony was still a five-member group (rest in peace) and were heading on tour for their second album “7/27.” The Florida-born singer joined my faves on tour, hitting several stops with the group across the U.S. 
Miller’s music and career were in a completely different place then. You can imagine: He was opening for a girl group (an iconic one, but still). His music was catchy and fit perfectly on a teen girl’s iPod Touch — I loved it then and I still love it now. Back then, he was also in a long-term relationship he now openly sings about and he was signed to a label that didn’t give him a ton of support. 
But as we sat in his tour bus in October — parked adjacent to the El Rey Theatre, where fans have been waiting in line to see him for hours — things were different. 
Miller’s confidence is booming, but he isn’t cocky. He’s finally signed to a new label, Sony Red, that he said is giving him plenty of creative freedom and he’s learned a lot from his brief stint as an independent artist. During that time, he spent hours upon hours watching YouTube learning how to produce his own tracks. 
“If there’s any musicians out there, you can learn anything on YouTube,” he told the crowd at El Rey that night between songs.
We talked about his latest collection “Summer 19,” which features three songs he produced that are some of his favorite. The tracks are catchy, the lyrics are relatable and his music just makes you happy.
For somebody who might just be logging onto your Spotify for the first time and hasn’t really heard your music, how would you describe that sound to them?
It’s definitely pop in terms of the genre. But I think that there’s something when you listen to my music, that’s a really positive vibe. Even the sad songs feel uplifting and inspiring because even the songs where it is about a heartbreak, it’s kind of more about how to get over the heartbreak. 
Especially these new songs. “Last Text” is a very empowering song about, ‘I’m not gonna let something in the past dictate my future. This is gonna be the last text I send you and then I’m gonna move on.’ “Could Have Been You” is the same way. It’s empowering in terms of,’ ‘I’m moving on with somebody else. And you missed out because that could’ve been you.’ I think the music is always just motivating and inspiring and positive. And it can really help people with life lessons, because they helped me. Writing the songs helped me. So I think they’re helping a lot of other people as well.
Your music feels real. When you’re writing, are you writing about your own real experiences?
Definitely. Everything that I write is about my life or someone else’s life, or just experiences that I’ve been through or stories that other people have told me. It’s definitely all coming from a very real place, and every song that I make, whether it’s about my life or not, I can really relate to it. 
Even if I’m not going through that emotion at the exact moment, as long as I can relate to the music and I’m going through something, I know somebody else out there is probably going through it as well.
What’s that first song you want people to listen to to find out who Jake Miller is? And why that song?
That’s a good question. Probably “Last Text.” I think “Last Text” captures Jake Miller, for some reason. I think it might be the acoustic element of it, I really just grew up listening to a lot of slow acoustic, John Mayer-type vibes and artists. 
The fact that I could bring that into that song, that’s the main reason I really love that song. And on top of that, I think the lyrics of “Last Text” are my favorite lyrics I’ve ever written — and I’m a big lyric guy. Definitely listen to that, listen to “Could Have Been You” and listen to “15 Minutes.” Those three, I think, would just give you a really great overall idea of who I am. 
Obviously, your sound has changed over the years. We’ve gotten  a lot of different sounds from Jake. Do you feel like you finally found the kind of music you want to continue making?
For now, I mean. It’s always changing. Next time I put out an EP, it’s going to sound even different than this one. That’s the whole fun of being an artist: You never really know, when you sit down to make an album, what’s going to come out of it. 
My next stuff might be a little bit more urban leaning, it might be more country leaning. I literally have no idea. It’s more just what I’m going through in that period of my life. I do know that this new EP is definitely my strongest work and exactly where I want to be right now as an artist.
That’s awesome. I was listening to an interview where you said you were at the beach and just started making a melody and started making the music. Where do you feel you’re most inspired?
I think you’re talking about “Palm Blvd.” Yeah, I was at the pool. Actually, it was at my apartment, which is right down the street. I wrote that whole song a few years ago, just acapella without a beat or any music in mind. I just came up with the melody, and I came up with the lyrics while sitting at the pool. Then I went back and made the beat. 
Where I actually make the music always changes. I feel like I write really well in the shower for some reason, because there’s nothing distracting me and I’m not looking at my phone or computer, like a rhyme website and getting too caught up in rhymes. 
It’s really when I’m just isolated. That’s when I come up with the best stuff.
You’ve cited  Jon Bellion and Mac Miller as some of your influences in the past. Tell me a little bit about who influences your music and who you are as an artist.
Yeah, as you said, Jon Bellion, Mac, John Mayer, I listened to so much different stuff, whether it’s Bob Marley or Bruce Springsteen. My dad had me growing up on The Eagles and Bruce Springsteen. 
And then I grew up listening to Eminem, that was probably the first introduction to hip-hop. And then I found Mac Miller in high school. If it wasn’t for him, I would have never started making my own music. He was really inspiring me to go after it. But John Mayer has been the constant of my favorite artists. The way that music makes you feel, like that’s the way I want people to feel with my music how I feel listening to his.
You’ve obviously rapped in some of your past albums. Do you think you would do it again? 
I can’t really ever say that I’ll never do anything again. Because who knows, but when I do rap, it’s to make my diehard fans happy. It’s not really because I enjoy doing it. It’s just because I know that there are people out there who really miss my rapping and so I do it for them, including my mom. She loves when I rap. But I personally don’t have as much fun making music and writing music when I’m rapping.
Who’s somebody you see yourself making music with? Who do you think your music connects with?
That’s a good question. Features have always been a really tricky thing for me and collabs, because I want to get to the point in my career where I don’t want to feel like I’m asking for a favor by having someone feature on my song. I want to get a point in my career where artists want to work with me just as badly as I want to work with them. And so, that’ll come. But I haven’t really been in that mindset recently.
I saw a few weeks ago, you retweeted something about people wanting you to audition for Prince Eric in “The Little Mermaid?” 
I did audition for Prince Eric.
Are you serious? 
Yeah, I didn’t get it, unfortunately. I’m definitely getting a lot more opportunities these days in terms of auditions. I have been to a few acting lessons recently. And I feel like I’m definitely becoming a better actor. Definitely a lot more room to grow. But music is always my priority. Hopefully one day I’ll book a great role. But for right now, I’m just kind of concentrated on the music.
That’s crazy, though. I saw all the tweets, like everyone was trying to connect you and I feel like you’d be perfect for the role. 
I actually auditioned before everybody even blew that up on social media. I knew I was about to audition. I was already memorizing lines, while the whole commotion on social media happened. So yeah, it was funny. It was funny timing.

Despite the Trojans’ up-and-down start, the opportunity to end this season with success remains within grasp. Sitting atop the Pac-12 South at 5-3, USC has a chance to earn a spot in the Pac-12 Championship and potentially even a Rose Bowl berth.
The Trojans’ biggest remaining hurdle comes this weekend in the form of a one-loss Oregon Ducks squad that’s ranked No. 7 in the country. Oregon enters the Coliseum with a seven-game win streak and will look to continue on its path toward a potential playoff berth. Saturday’s game could define the remainder of the season for both teams.
USC Offense vs Oregon Defense
For three weeks, we’ve watched the Trojan offense turn in mixed performances, playing at a completely different level from quarter to quarter and game to game. Against Oregon, that must change.
USC’s run game is in a compromised situation with all three of its primary backs out with injury. Freshman Kenan Christon has been carrying the load for USC since, and although the speedster has been exciting when given the opportunity to run the ball, it seems unlikely that he’ll get many chances to do so on Saturday. In his first game as a starter last week at Colorado, Christon was given only 10 carries.
The Trojans face an Oregon defense that allows only 103 rushing yards per game on 3.6 yards per carry, so look for them to put this game on the shoulders of freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis. Oregon’s defense is most vulnerable to the pass — evidenced by the 406 yards it gave up to WSU last week — and the Trojans will need to attack through the air in order to put points on the board.
Despite some hiccups, Slovis has played very well down the stretch, especially late in games. He’ll have to capitalize on advantageous matchups downfield with his elite corps of receivers against a talented but inconsistent Oregon secondary — the outcome of the game will likely depend on it. In particular, look for wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown to have a big game; the sophomore has been lacking targets for the past few weeks, and with Oregon likely to double-team senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr., this might just be St. Brown’s day.
Oregon Offense vs USC Defense
The Ducks are led by senior quarterback Justin Herbert, considered by many a lock to be a top 10 pick in next year’s NFL Draft. Herbert has gotten off to an efficient start this season, throwing for 2,104 yards and 21 touchdowns against only a single interception. The Oregon signal-caller has a big arm and the ability to make tough throws to every level of the field — the Trojan secondary will have its hands full on Saturday.
However, Oregon will be missing its leading receiver in catches, yards and touchdowns in senior tight end Jacob Breeland, who was injured during the team’s Oct. 11 win over Colorado. The Ducks lack a clear No. 1 receiver in his absence. With the return of freshman cornerback Chris Steele and the improved health of cornerbacks sophomore Olaijah Griffin and redshirt freshman Isaac-Taylor Stuart, the Trojans should have their best cornerbacks ready to play, giving them a chance to limit Oregon’s passing attack.
On the ground, the Ducks are a capable team, rushing for 190 yards per game behind a committee of talented backs. The Trojans will have to be stout up front on defense to have any chance at limiting them; but the return of a healthy redshirt senior defensive lineman Christian Rector and potentially even sophomore inside linebacker Palaie Gaoteote IV will be a huge boost to the team’s front seven. It’ll be imperative for the Trojans to both limit Oregon’s running game and get pressure on Herbert. 
Prediction: 35-31, USC
For weeks now, I’ve had the strangest suspicion that USC will find a way to surprise Oregon at home, and now only days away from the game, it still feels right. The Trojans have an odd tendency to find ways to win at home in the Coliseum, and with so much on the line, they’ll certainly come into the game as motivated as they’ve been all year. Herbert has had trouble in the past in tough road environments, and the loss of his leading receiver certainly won’t help.
This feels like the perfect trap game for Oregon. The Trojans are a team built to give the Ducks trouble, especially if Slovis can play his best. I expect a huge upset here for the Trojans — one that could put them in the driver’s seat for a berth in the Pac-12 title game.

Silence overcame the rowdy Coliseum crowd as sophomore quarterback JT Daniels lay injured on the turf midway through the Trojans’ season opener. As freshman Kedon Slovis stepped behind center, there was speculation as to whether the 3-star recruit out of Scottsdale, Ariz., was ready to inherit a close game on one of college football’s biggest stages. 
The nerves were certainly there, but Slovis did what he needed to do, hurling a deep ball to set up a score and ultimately leading the Trojans to an 8-point victory over the Fresno State Bulldogs. 
After Slovis got the job done in his debut, head coach Clay Helton announced Daniels would miss the rest of the season. Now the starter, Slovis was thrust further into the spotlight ahead of a highly anticipated matchup with Stanford.
“It was terrible to see JT go down,” Slovis said. “He’s [my] teammate, he’s a friend. I didn’t know the implications of the injury. I didn’t know he was going to be out for the entire year. Especially finding that out was hard to hear. But everyone gets their opportunity at some point, and you never know when you’re going to get another one.”
This was not the first time Slovis had to rise to such a challenge. During his two years as the starter for Desert Mountain High School, he was expected to compensate for a small offensive line and a defense that had trouble getting stops.
Former Desert Mountain offensive coordinator and Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Kurt Warner said he and former head coach David Sedmak placed high demands on the young quarterback, but Slovis thrived with the responsibility.
“I told him early on, ‘We are going to expect you to do more than most high school quarterbacks in the entire country,” Warner said. “‘From calling plays to what you’re going to have to see, and more importantly, to the number of throws you’re going to have to make in each game, is probably going to be more than any quarterback in the league.’ And … he welcomed the opportunity to have to make every play.”
Although Slovis showed promise in basketball his freshman year and was named team MVP, the analytical nature of the quarterback position and the responsibilities it entails continued to bring him back to football.
“He just loved the position of quarterback,” Kedon’s father Max Slovis said. “He loves the cerebral position where he gets to dissect what the other team’s doing and analyze and then make the decision of where [his team’s] going to go with that play. Whereas basketball’s a little more of a one-on-one, in-your-face kind of sport … That didn’t really fit him as much.”
Kedon began to focus solely on football, putting in extra hours with his long-time quarterback coach Shawn Seaman in addition to going to high school practices. 
Max recalled a conversation he had with his son about his goals as an athlete. Even before Kedon made Desert Mountain’s varsity squad, he was confident that he wanted to work toward being a Division I quarterback.
“We sat down, talked about it a little bit, and I said, ‘Alright then, that is your job,’” Max said. “‘Your job is to become a Division I quarterback. You don’t need to get a job after hours … this becomes your biggest goal, to do everything you can to make it happen and academically make it happen.’”
Unlike many future Division I quarterbacks, Slovis did not start for his high school team as a sophomore, waiting his turn behind then-senior Austin Nuessle. As a backup, Slovis initially struggled with the wordiness and complexity of the plays he was expected to call.
Warner recalled giving Slovis the practice script and advising him to incorporate practicing the play calls into his routine, reciting them in front of the mirror or in his bedroom.
“Most kids in high school would be like, ‘Oh whatever, I’m not going to go home and practice calling plays,’” Warner said. “But he did it at that point in time when he was a sophomore, and I thought, ‘OK, that’s something a little different about him,’ and I found that out before he was even [starting].”
Once Slovis became the starter his junior year, Warner and Sedmak noticed not only his work ethic, but his ability to take accountability for and recover from mistakes, a critical trait for a player whose program rested on his shoulders.
Sedmak recalled Slovis’ first high school start against crosstown rival Chaparral High School, a program that had won the majority of its contests against Desert Mountain in the years prior. His team fell behind 20-0 at the half, but after Slovis led a comeback effort, the score was 27-21 Chaparral with seconds to go.
From just outside the red zone, Slovis put the ball up for grabs, but a Chaparral defender came down with it and ran the interception back for a touchdown. A boisterous celebration erupted in the far end zone as the Desert Mountain team looked on, dejected. Having taken a helmet to the chest, Slovis returned slowly to his feet.
But the game wasn’t over yet — a flag had been thrown on the hit. The opposing team’s celebration died down as the referee called roughing the passer, giving Desert Mountain a final untimed down and a chance to win the game.
Despite getting the wind knocked out of him just seconds earlier, Slovis stepped up in the pocket and found the open man in the end zone for the game-winning touchdown.
“Just amazing that he had that poise, that toughness, that he could come back immediately after … first of all, he got intercepted,” Sedmak said. “Second of all, it was emotional because the game was over, and third, he got crushed, and yet he could put all that behind him within 30 seconds or a minute and make the big play both mentally and physically so we could win the game.”
Slovis continues to demonstrate his ability to recover from mistakes as a Trojan. A lot of buzz surrounded the young quarterback after his record-breaking first start against Stanford, but his first road game was another story. Slovis threw three interceptions in USC’s loss to BYU, including a costly pick in overtime to seal the Trojans’ fate.
Sedmak said Slovis was eager to step back onto the field and prove he was better than the performance fans saw at BYU. After suffering a concussion on the second play from scrimmage against Utah, Slovis returned to face then-No. 9 Notre Dame on the road.
Although he managed just 74 passing yards in the first half, the freshman lit up in the second, finishing with 255 yards and two touchdowns against a Notre Dame defense that had only given up three passing touchdowns through five games. As the Trojans came up just short of a brilliant upset, it became clear that Slovis could be the top signal-caller for the long haul.
With Slovis’ talent at quarterback and poise beyond his years, it may come as a surprise that he was largely unheard of during the recruiting process. Desert Mountain went 6-5 his junior year and isn’t known for harvesting Division I talent. Slovis also lacked varsity film from his sophomore year, which likely contributed to his status as a 3-star recruit.
But then visiting programs saw Slovis in action.
“Once the [coaches] came it was like, ‘OK, what doesn’t this kid have?’” Warner said. “‘Why have we not heard anything about this kid?’ And it was simply just because nobody really gave him the time to take a look at who he was and what he was capable of.”
Less than a week after USC made Slovis an offer, he and his family visited campus, and it was game over from there.
“First of all, the academics here,” Slovis said of his reasons for committing to USC. “My parents and all of my extended family really value that, so when I was wanting to play college football, the big thing was to make sure [I] go to a school that’s academically up there. But also, it’s a historic football power with 11 national championships. Not many other schools have that combination of both athletics and academics.”
Slovis took extra classes during his junior year and over the summer so he could graduate early and participate in USC’s spring camp. 2018 starting quarterback JT Daniels, redshirt junior Matt Fink and redshirt sophomore Jack Sears were all returning for spring ball, but Slovis had every intention of being in the mix for the top job.
“The plan was to go and compete for the job as a freshman,” Sedmak said. “He’s got that focus and that drive … and the reports coming back, especially through spring ball, were that he was doing really, really, well … When they named him the backup I was not surprised. It’s not something that you would expect, but knowing him and who he is and how hungry he was, I wasn’t surprised.”
Slovis said he tried to drown out the performances of the veteran quarterbacks he was competing with to focus on proving his own talent.
“When I focused on the other guys, those were probably my worst reps or days,” Slovis said. “I decided to just focus on what I was doing, do my best and at the end of the day, you can control what you can control, and the coaches will put you where you’re supposed to be.”
The chance that head coach Clay Helton and offensive coordinator Graham Harrell took on the young quarterback is paying off.
In the Trojans’ last game against Colorado, Slovis threw for 406 yards and four touchdowns with just one interception on the night. His 72.3% completion percentage this season ranks sixth amongst all NCAA quarterbacks and is the highest for any freshman.
The casual supporter and football fanatic alike appreciate Slovis’ game, and even students who don’t follow the football team recognize Slovis as its front man. Following his breakout performance against Stanford, the title of USC’s student meme page on Facebook was changed to “Kedon Slovis Fanclub Incorporated,” the same page where posts satirizing the Trojans’ disastrous losses could be found last season.
As chants of “Kedon Slovis” erupted from the Coliseum stands that night, it was clear that the fresh face had returned some of the energy to a Trojan program still recovering from that rough 2018 campaign.
“It was surreal, but at the same time, I tried not to let it change anything,” Slovis said of his fellow students’ support following the Stanford game. “As much as people think things have changed for me, the only difference is probably people recognize me more now, but everything I do in the facility and outside of football is relatively the same.”
With Slovis’ sudden new role came increased media attention. His inexperience showed as he stumbled through the first postgame press conference, but like his play-calling ability, Kedon’s new sense of confidence with the media has come with practice.
“He has grown into [his confidence] much more in the last year and a half, and he takes great pride in being able to handle those situations in front of the camera, in front of the microphone, so he goes back and looks at that stuff, too,” Max said of his son. “He definitely works on it and thinks it’s important to put out the best product, whether as an interview or in the pocket.”
Although Slovis is younger than the majority of his teammates, he is taken seriously as a leader and has become more comfortable with experience.
“When he first got here, he was kind of low key, but then after [the] Stanford game … he’s been way more vocal,” redshirt freshman running back Markese Stepp said. “You can tell he’s matured. He’s been taking on more of a leadership role, and you can just tell he’s a competitor.”
After his transition from being a 3-star recruit to the starting quarterback for such a historic football program, Slovis continues to prove he can handle the limelight.

Andres Ruvalcaba placed a giant fan on his desk and sat his client down in a large barber chair, which had been swapped in for his desk chair. The room also housed a small couch and a TV playing a Travis Scott music video. On the wall was a framed barber certification next to some pictures with friends. Ruvalcaba fished his razor out of a drawer and assessed the state of his client’s hair. 
The client, Max Wintroub, requested his typical cut. Wintroub, Ruvalcaba’s housemate, has been going to him for haircuts for the past two years. This was nothing new for him. 
“He’s the homie, and I trust him,” Wintroub, a junior majoring in music industry, asserted with confidence. “He’s a professional.” 
Ruvalcaba, a senior majoring in accounting and business administration, has certainly earned his clients’ trust, given his seven years of experience. He began cutting hair when he was a sophomore in high school. Tired of paying someone to cut his hair every week, Ruvalcaba decided to purchase his own clippers and enroll in a part-time barber school program. 
“It was a big commitment,” Ruvalcaba recalled. “It was Monday through Friday 4 to 9 p.m. and Saturdays 9 to 5 … for 16 months straight.”
The course was fundamental to Ruvalcaba’s growth and gave him an opportunity to sharpen his interpersonal skills, perfect his time management and learn from his older peers. 
The training, which totalled 1,500 hours, paid off quite literally. Ruvalcaba has an impressively large clientele in his hometown of Concord, Calif., and among the student body at USC. 
“Back home, I have a list of like 200 clients, so I was able to stay busy,” Ruvalcaba said. “Over here, I probably have like 75 clients that text me regularly. Back home, I would do like 80 people a week. Here, maybe I’ll do like 10, 15 at most.”
Balancing a rigorous course load and a stacked appointment schedule has not always been easy for Ruvalcaba. For instance, he would have 80 appointments in a week while he was still in high school. The Wednesday before Thanksgiving he expects to do 20 haircuts in one day. 
Ruvalcaba said he spent a semester working part-time at a barbershop near USC and found it difficult to focus on his academics and maintain a heavy work schedule. He would spend an average of 20 hours a week at work. But he credits this challenge with helping him develop a strong work ethic that he hopes will propel his career as an accountant. 
“Trying to study in a barbershop atmosphere is impossible,” he said. “Everyone is always shooting the shit, kind of just talking, hanging out.” 
So, to exert more control over his schedule, Ruvalcaba chose to continue his work cutting hair at his home on Menlo Avenue. His room is equipped with a barber chair, hardwood floors and all of his equipment. While the setup is not perfect, he said it is functional and comfortable for him and his clients. 
“I’ve always done it out of my house. I had always cut my friends’ hair,” Ruvalcaba said. “My mom and dad were super accepting, so they were OK with 20 people a day coming in and out of the front door.” 
Ruvalcaba stressed the influence his parents had on him. They gifted him his first tools. They encouraged him throughout barber school. They opened their home to his clients. 
“They were super supportive,” Ruvalcaba said. “Without them, I wouldn’t be able to do any of this.” 
Another creative source for Ruvalcaba has been his friends and fellow students from his time in barber school. He said he stays in touch with them through social media. 
“My inspiration for my haircuts are my peers, like learning stuff from them, what they’re doing, their new skills and just trying to incorporate everyone’s techniques and building my own craft out of it,” Ruvalcaba said. 
However, there is something about Ruvalcaba’s approach that differs from that of his peers. 
“I’m an accountant,” he said. “I have no artistic feel. I’m sorry. People see haircuts as like an art, like a sculpture. I see it as numbers. I can look at someone’s head and I could tell you what number it is on the side.”
According to Ruvalcaba, it’s his analytical approach that makes him an effective barber. He emphasized the importance of effective communication between a barber and a client, and he considers a pre-cut consultation a necessity. Ruvalcaba revealed that the easiest appointments for him are those in which the client knows exactly what he wants. He also assured that his main goals were making his client comfortable and giving him a cut he loves. 
Austin Lowe, a junior majoring in business administration, said that the combination of a comfortable, friendly environment and Ruvalcaba’s professional demeanor keeps him coming back. 
 “I would recommend Andres because one, he treats you like a real client, it feels like you’re at a barbershop,” Lowe added, “and two, you’re getting a great haircut.”
The magic of Ruvalcaba’s at-home barber studio is that he is able to gain his clients trust and give them confidence in their haircuts. 
“Being a student, I’m really more in with the trend, [the client and I] have more to relate about and talk about,” Ruvalcaba said. “It’s actually like a service, and like you feel appreciated, and I really just listen to the client. I don’t assume what they want — I want to know what they want, and I want them to know what they want.” 
In the future, Ruvalcaba expects he will spend less time cutting hair as he focuses more on his career. But he was sure graduation won’t be the end of his passion for cutting hair. 
“If I end up having a son, for example, I will definitely teach him how to cut hair,” Ruvalcaba said. “That’s the way I’ll continue, is just me passing on what I’ve learned to someone else.”

Vice President of Student Affairs Winston Crisp posted a letter to the USC Parents Facebook group Thursday morning acknowledging a lack of parent communication regarding concerns of mental health and assuring them of the University’s ongoing commitment to student well-being. Since the start of the school year, at least five students have passed away.   
According to the letter, the University has expanded services at the counseling center, hiring 12 additional counselors in recent months. Crisp wrote that with the increased number of counselors, the student-to-therapist ratio at the University now meets national recommendation numbers. 
“We are only at the beginning,” Crisp wrote. “We will continue to improve [University mental health resources] by adding more resources and services as necessary. In the meantime … we are reviewing and revising our care model including intake, and screening and referral to ensure that we can provide the best possible services.”
The International Accreditation of Counseling Services recommends a ratio of one therapist per 1,000-1,500 students. Executive Director and Division Chief for Student Health Robert Mendola said the Counseling and Mental Health department had one counselor for every 1,800 students in October 2018. 
Student concern regarding wait times at the health center has been ongoing.
Crisp also wrote that the addition of long-term mental health services to Engemann Student Health Center, which was proposed as part of an overhaul of USC’s mental health services introduced in 2018, will be implemented by summer 2020.
Dr. Steven Siegel, chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, said the expansion aims to broaden mental health care access to a wider student population and provide a convenient clinical setting for ongoing mental health care.
“One of our goals is really to look inward now, examine how we’re delivering our care inside Student Health and think really judiciously about ‘Is there another way?’” Siegel said. “We are putting a lot of our effort into just examining every step from initial contact and trying to think about better ways to have first contact within Student Health.”
According to Siegel, the floor will be staffed by six psychiatrists and 12 therapists devoted solely to clinical care. Currently, the estimated 45 Counseling and Mental Health staff members serve on crisis and outreach teams in addition to their roles as clinicians.
The post was made in the wake of the death of senior John Moore, whose passing on Sunday was the most recent of at least five student deaths since the start of the semester. In the letter, Crisp wrote that the University recently partnered with the JED Foundation, a nonprofit organization that works with colleges and high schools to improve programs focused on student mental health and the prevention of suicide and substance abuse.
The letter also comes one week after a town hall event discussing mental health and wellbeing that was hosted by the Undergraduate Student Government on Oct. 24. 
At the event, which reportedly had an audience of 10 students, staff from USC Student Health, Counseling and Mental Health and Campus Wellbeing & Crisis Intervention spoke about mental health options currently available to USC students and resources the University will work to provide in the future, including the planned expansion of Engemann to offer longer-term mental health services.
As part of Trojan Family Weekend, a panel for parents called “Your Student’s Wellbeing” was held Thursday. The panel, moderated by Provost Charles Zukoski, featured mental health professionals and University administrators about student health and well-being.
Crisp closed the panel with a call to action.
“We’re going to be working on the communication avenues,” Crisp said. “But in the meantime, we need you — especially now, when we’ve got a lot of mental health issues going on not just in this country but at this University — we need you checking in, we need you asking questions, we need you still trying to figure out when you think something is maybe not going right.”
Crisp asked parents to alert the University via Trojans Care for Trojans or the new 411 helpline in the event that they notice anything unusual in their communication with their students, saying that parents are still students’ first point of contact when they might be struggling.
