Twenty-eight USC students attended the three-day Joseph R. Cerrell Sacramento Seminar in Political Leadership over the weekend. The seminar selected attendees from a competitive pool of applicants and took selected students on a three-day trip to California’s capital city to meet and learn from some of the state’s most prominent leaders.

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics sponsored and organized the seminar. Dan Schnur, who is taking a leave of absence from his position as director of the institute to run for California Secretary of State, said the seminar falls in line with the Unruh Institute’s mission to bring the student body and politics closer together.
“We believe very strongly that the best way to get students interested in politics, government and public service is to bring politics to campus,” he said. “The single most valuable thing that comes out of this program is that a number of the students who participated are going to go on and work in public service after they graduate.”
Students listened to a wide variety of panels and speakers, including a conversation with Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tempore of the California State Senate, and Evan Westrup, Gov. Jerry Brown’s press secretary.
The format of the seminar reflected the Unruh Institute’s commitment to bipartisanship and policy discussions. Not only did the selected students occupy a wide range of political perspectives, but also each panel brought together representatives from both sides of the aisle to create a conversation that presented the many sides of each issue.
Anthony Portantino, a former state assemblyman, and Tony Strickland, a former state senator who is now running for Congress, both teach a class at USC and accompanied the students to Sacramento. The duo participated in a panel on political leadership with John Myers, the political editor at ABC News 10 in Sacramento and Amy Chance, the political editor for the Sacramento Bee.
The panel, moderated by Schnur, examined notable upcoming elections and recent electoral reforms. Portantino said the reforms reveal that now is a critical time for students to pay attention to state politics.
“I think everybody agreed that we’ll get some clarity after the next election cycle as to how the top two and redistricting will affect politics going forward,” he said. “You guys are going to be on the cutting edge of that new paradigm.”
Strickland agreed and spoke of the impact the reforms have had on making candidates more moderate.
“Now, no longer is a Democrat or a Republican as an elected official in Sacramento or Washington, D.C. going to be able to know, ‘I’ve got my party’s nomination,’” he said. “I think, quite frankly, that’s one of the main reasons why a lot of the older members decided to quit.”
Students who attended the seminar, including Rachel Scott, a sophomore majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, said the experience provided opportunities to meet leaders and make connections that wouldn’t be possible at USC.
“I’d recommend this to anyone who has the slightest interest in politics — which doesn’t even have to be running for office,” Scott said. “Being up here for two days, I’ve gotten to network with around 30 people that I wouldn’t have met otherwise, from press secretaries to journalists and assemblymen.”
Nick Kosturos, a junior majoring in international relations, said the seminar was also about the chance to see state politics in action with students that were united by a common interest in politics.
“We’re all like-minded — we do care about public service and want to learn more about the system,” he said. “That natural curiosity allowed for discussions that happened after the panels that deepened our knowledge, since we were able to argue amongst ourselves.”
For Kosturos, forming bonds with the other attending students was the best part.
“The best part of the seminar was growing close to everyone,” he said. “We were able to develop relationships and forge bonds united by a common interest in state politics.”
Staff writer Nathaniel Haas was one of the students selected to attend the seminar.

On Friday, the Center on Public Diplomacy at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism held its 10th annual research conference, “A New Era in Cultural Diplomacy: Rising Soft Power in Emerging Markets.”

The event was co-sponsored by the Center for International Studies, and its purpose was to help students better understand the global environment. It explored the cultural diplomacy efforts pursued by a number of countries with emerging economies.
“Organizing an engaging and timely conference requires tremendous research on who are the thought leaders, academics and practitioners [that] will contribute to the overall program, but also to the larger dialogue about cultural diplomacy in emerging markets,” said Assistant Director for Programming and Events of the CPD Stacy Ingber in an email. “The global stage no longer includes the same old players. Countries such as Turkey, India, China, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria and Russia must be considered in public diplomacy research and practice.”
The panels throughout the day included “Cultural Diplomacy: Continuity and Disjuncture,” “Confucius Institutes: The Globalization of Chinese Soft Power,” and “Conversation: GREAT Britain in Emerging Markets” and “Dialogues Through Film.”
“I thought the final two panels, [“Conversation: GREAT Britain in Emerging Markets” and “Dialogues Through Film”] were really interesting,” said Reagan Cook, a second-year graduate student studying public diplomacy. “For instance, I knew of the GREAT Campaign of Great Britain, but I didn’t really understand the dynamics and scope of it, and I thought the panelist who presented it did a really good job of explaining the dynamics and actual preparation behind the campaign.”
Panelists included figures from all over the world to talk about their respective topics.
“We want people to unite, and not to judge people through events of the past,” said Executive Director of the Polish Film Festival Los Angeles Vladek Juszkiewicz. “We collaborate with other film festivals to bring certain subjects because we think the subjects can bring out different audiences. We collaborate with Chinese festivals [and] Indian festivals, where issues of human rights are addressed; this is where diplomacy happens. This is the idea of trying to bring people together and educate them.”
Future events of the CPD include a talk by former U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter, who will discuss his firsthand experience on the complicated relationship with Pakistan on April 2.
“We want students to understand that they are the next generation of public diplomacy practitioners,” Ingber said in an email. “Creating an opportunity for students to engage on these issues, whether they see themselves working in a government setting, for NGOs, or continue on their academic studies, they must be aware of the emerging countries so they can develop their profession and impact on the world’s stage.”

The USC Digital Repository announced on Thursday that it will be maintaining and preserving a 320-terabyte collection of audiovisual materials that has been created by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences throughout the last 50 years.
The collection, filled with thousands of hours of footage, documents the history of the Academy through the Academy Awards ceremony, the Academy Film Archive’s digital restoration projects and other events and projects.
The Academy Film Archive, which was established in 1991 and aims to support the preservation and restoration of film as well as the study of motion pictures, has become one of most extensive film collections in the entire world.
The Digital Repository is an initiative that brings together USC Libraries, the Shoah Foundation, and Information Technology Services. The current arrangement between the Academy and the Digital Repository will focus on preserving the collection for the long term.
“[The] purpose of the Digital Repository is to use the technology infrastructure of ITS and the Shoah Foundation, and the metadata and collection experts in the libraries to make a business out of preserving and making accessible huge digital collections that no one else can do,” said Hugh McHarg, associate dean of planning and communications for USC Libraries.
McHarg went on to note that the work being done among these three USC institutions is unlike that at any other in the nation.
“There is no other partnership at a major institution like the USC Digital Repository,” McHarg said. “It brings together the expertise that the Shoah Foundation has with the videos and audio of the Holocaust survivors’ testimonies; it brings together the expertise of the ITS and the high computing performance center. [It also] loops in the expertise of the libraries of cataloging and creating meaningful metadata so that people can find and discover these things now and in the future.”
In a press release, Director of the Academy Film Archive Michael Pogorzelski noted the importance of maintaining film history.
“Preserving the history of cinema in all its forms always has been a prime concern of the Academy,” Pogorzelski said. “That history lives in film reels, movie posters, lobby cards — and now, digital files. We need to preserve our digital history alongside our celluloid heritage for the next century and beyond. That’s what this project with USC is all about.”
In addition to the technological aspect, part of preserving the collection will include extensive cataloging, so that in due time, people will be able to find the information they need and use it in a meaningful way.
“It is one of the biggest collections in the Digital Repository to date,” McHarg said. “It is a pretty prestigious thing to have under our care.”

On Saturday, the seventh annual Trojan Dance Marathon took place for 12 consecutive hours at the Ronald Tutor Center Ballroom.
Dance for a cause · The Trojan Dance Marathon planning committee holds up the final fundraising total raised in the past year. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Trojan DM serves as a fundraising campaign for Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and has raised more than $100,000 since 2008. This year’s event set a record as the Trojan DM raised more than $59,000.
The event was made possible by 14 committees that focus on different aspects of the planning such as community, performances and fundraising that serve to bring together the holistic DM experience.
“We have Miracle Children that represent the hospital, and these are kids and their families who have long relationships with CHLA depending on an illness they’ve had or an accident they’ve been in,” said Crescent Cheng, the campus coordinator for Trojan DM. “These kids have had really positive experiences with CHLA and want to advocate for the hospital. It’s also a chance for USC students to see where all the hard work goes to while hanging out with the kids they’re helping and listening to them share their stories.”
Without a single chair in the room, not even for the people registering participants, the TCC Ballroom was set up with tables to check in for wristbands and a complimentary shirt for those who had raised more than $15 prior to the event. Along the sides of the ballroom were various stations for arts and crafts.
Those who donated were given raffle tickets that could be placed in a multitude of jars offering $150 Uber giftcards, various jewelry items and a gift card to Pressed Juicery.
Even students who didn’t have the opportunity to raise money ahead of time were able to give back through the DM “jail.” They donated $5 to put someone in “jail” for one hour. The bail was set at $20.
“I think the jail idea was really clever, because I wanted to give back after meeting the Miracle Kids, while having a good time with my friends,” said Claire Witzke, a freshman majoring in linguistics. “DM made it possible to see where all the effort and money was going, making the experience of giving back enjoyable.”
Every two hours, the hosts of DM would introduce a new theme and DM members and the  Miracle Children would dress accordingly. The themes included Princesses and Pirates, Candyland, Jungle, Country and Rave Power Hour. Each theme featured a different DJ.
At the end of each hour, participants were taught small,      one-minute dances by the DM morale captains. The dance was a series of popular songs mashed together. By the end of 12 hours, the crowd performed an effortless 12-minute long dance routine.
“I decided to go simply as a study break, and I was shocked to see how amazing Dance Marathon is,” said Riyana Chakraborty, a freshman majoring in international relations (global business). “The people are incredibly passionate, the miracle children were all smiles and the overall experience was unforgettable.”
Cheng spoke on the extensive preparation that goes into DM.
“We start planning for the next Dance Marathon after this event is done, so it really is a yearlong process,” Cheng said. “In order to have as much of the student body as possible to come out and raise money, it takes months of organizing.”
DM special events coordinator Sarah Loh discussed how awareness alone can be helpful.
“Whether it’s a fundraiser to help raise money or just an awareness campaign, it can really help [the children and the hospital],” Loh said. “Just last week we had a photo campaign where we just had people take pictures with props or photos in front of Tommy Trojan that would raise awareness throughout campus by putting the photos on various social media.”
DM reminded students that all the effort is “FTK: For The Kids.” Every hour participants would simultaneously respond to the question posed by the morale captains, “Why are you here?” with an enthusiastic “Trojan Dance Marathon, for the kids!”

Though things have been quiet on the video game front since the holiday season, which saw the release of the Xbox One and the Playstation 4, March looks to bring a wide assortment of games for both current-gen consoles and next-gen consoles. Some big titles have already come out, including Thief and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, but here’s a quick preview of the blockbuster titles coming out.
South Park: The Stick of Truth, the long-in-development turn-based RPG, featuring a pantheon of South Park characters, is finally set to come out March 4 for PS3, Xbox 360 and PC. A playable version of the game was available for E3 in 2012. The original publisher, THQ, folded, so the project, was then picked up by Ubisoft.
The long production period seems to have paid off; written and directed by South Park showrunners Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the gameplay footage has shown that the experience of playing will really be akin to being inside of an episode. The world even retains the cardboard textures and isometric perspective associated with the show.
Dark Souls II, the sequel to Dark Souls, is due to come out on March 11 for current-gen consoles to destroy the confidence of even the most hardened player. The game’s predecessor, built a reputation for its merciless and difficult gameplay — though, many have come to admire the subtleties of the combat, which demands patience and concentration instead of button-mashing.
It seems the game won’t be losing any of its difficulty, promising a vast, dark, twisted world full of monsters and opponents that can kill you in a heartbeat. To liven things up, Dark Souls II is introducing a new class-based system, giving players a more cohesive and versatile approach. Japanese videogame company FromSoftware has also revamped the multiplayer aspect, which in prior games was kept intentionally vague but is now backed by dedicated multiplayer servers. The drawback, however, is that now players can “invade” your playthrough at any time, which will make the experience that much more anxious but exciting.
Titanfall, due for the Xbox One and PC on March 11 and Xbox 360 on March 25, is the first true “killer app” for the Microsoft console. Created by Respawn Entertainment, which features many of the same developers who started the mega-blockbuster Call of Duty franchise, the sci-fi multiplayer FPS has a lot riding on it. Promising intense 6v6 matchups between sky-hopping soldiers and giant mechas, the hype surrounding E3 and the beta promises to be a wild, enthralling game.
Perhaps as a sign of genre specialization, the game will be multiplayer-only. This seems like an inevitable development for first-person shooters, as games such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Battlefield 4 have pushed single-player campaigns to the background in favor of online matchmaking. Rather than attaching a single-player mode, Respawn has focused its energy into making the most compelling multiplayer experience possible.
inFamous: Second Son, coming out exclusively for the Playstation 4 on March 21, doesn’t have the hype of Titanfall but it’s nonetheless one of the first triple-A titles for the PS4. Featuring a new character, the open-world title changes up the superpowered gameplay from Cole MacGrath’s electric-based powers to Delsin Rowe’s more versatile “smoke-based” abilities.
With a new location, new powers and a next-gen coat of paint, the title shows Sony Entertainment’s commitment to studios who stay house: The developers of the inFamous series, Sucker Punch, have also developed the Sony-exclusive series Sly Cooper.
Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, coming out March 18 for both next-gen and current-gen consoles, is an extended prologue for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, which is due to come out sometime in 2015. A prequel of sorts set in the 1970s (the Metal Gear series is notorious for its complicated chronology), you’ll take control of Naked Snake (now voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) infiltrating a mysterious military operation on Cuban soil.
Though it promises a true open- world experience, reports have indicated that the game is actually quite short, with some reporting that it can be beaten in two to three hours. That’s a short experience even for the “reduced” price of $29.99. It’s possible that this is a preview of how future DLC will be done: Rather than just add-on content, they’ll be standalone games, leading consumers to seek out the full versions.
Just these five games alone would be enough but in addition to titles like Diablo III: Reaper of Souls, Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, and Final Fantasy X-X2 HD, you can’t help but hate these game companies for releasing so many marquee titles during midterms.

While working in New York, USC alumnus Johnny Skandros noticed a new scene arising among gay men in the city in the way they groomed and dressed.
Life is scruff · Johnny Skandros, a USC alumnus and founder of Scruff, attributes the inspiration for Scruff to a course on gay and lesbian cinema and says that the app would not be around if it were not for the class. – Photo courtesy of Adam Mischlich of Pivotal PR
 
“I was at a bar and touching this guy’s face, and I thought, ‘Wow, this guy’s face is really scruffy,’” Skandros said.
What was originally just a playful gesture soon turned into an invaluable idea for a new app.
“The inspiration for the app was there were other gay dating apps out at the time but they weren’t really for everyone,” Skandros said. “I kind of had a lightbulb [go off] that night, where I thought that would be a really cool idea for an app.”
Skandros is the founder of Scruff, a social network for gay men that stretches across the globe. The app, available on iOS, Android and Windows, has six million members and counting, from the United States, Australia and even Brazil.
Before founding the app, Skandros was a USC student studying film production but took several business classes on the side, including accounting, marketing and entrepreneurship.
“At the time, I didn’t know if I wanted to do film or business, but I ended up choosing film,” Skandros said.
One class in particular, a course on gay and lesbian cinema, had a strong impact on what Skandros wanted to eventually do.
“It was probably the most valuable class I ever took at USC, and it really opened my eyes to the craft of film and how gender, sexuality, and ethnicity is represented … that is why I wanted to start Scruff,” Skandros said.
After being in the film industry for about three years, Skandros teamed up with Eric Silverberg and started Scruff, but not without making some sacrifices first. To save money for their bootstrapped project, both Skandros and Silverberg lived at home to work on the marketing and technical aspects of the app, respectively.
This patience began to pay off a couple of months into the project. Though progress was slow, eventually the Scruff team was gaining enough traction that it was able to move back to New York and expand their group, which now has 30 people.
Despite the entry of other apps such as Tinder and Grindr within this similar space, Skandros has never been intimidated by them.
“The gay space has many apps out there, there’s no one supreme app,” Skandros said. “Scruff is about connecting guys to one another and the global gay community … and generally, the guys who use Scruff are friendlier.”
In addition to being able to find other gay men in the vicinity, Scruff is also very diverse — it was the first app to have a transgender community — and offers other features including filters based on interest and an event tab where you can discover any upcoming events in the area. What makes Scruff stand out from other apps is the way users interact with it.
“We’ll have a lot of members [use the app] when they’re traveling and ask members where to go, which restaurants to eat at, or what gay bars to go to in the evening,” Skandros said.
Skandros believes that because he puts himself out there as the face of Scruff, he’s been able to reach more people as he communicates and listens to all of his users.
“It’s really important to me to personalize the brand of the app that way,” Skandros said. “I think people respond to that very well, and I’ve built up a very large fan base.”
Skandros also holds events in multiple cities and always has people telling him about their Scruff stories and experiences. One of the more common success stories that Skandros hears about is marriage, which he says happens all the time.
“Those mean the most to me, that’s what I work so hard for — that connection,” Skandros said. “I know it sounds cheesy, but when you hear that two people were able to connect and find love … because of this dating service, that’s incredible.”
When looking back on his USC experience, Skandros found that the community was especially accepting, and continues to look back on the film class that influenced Scruff.
“That class … really opened up my mind about gay history and about how the LGBT community is represented in media and society,” Skandros said. “Scruff would not be around today if it wasn’t for [that class].”
As for the future of the app, Skandros is considering building a website version of Scruff. In the meantime, the company is doing more with media, including appearances on RuPaul’s Drag Race. Scruff is also looking to hold more events for its European crowd this time around, and hopes to keep the momentum going for.
“We did several [events] last year, but we want to step it up this year … we just want to keep on going and there’s no slowing down,” Skandros said.

When people think of food in Philadelphia, the first thing that comes to mind is the cheesesteak. The sandwich, which usually consists of thinly-chopped steak, cheese and bread, is an edible metaphor for the city: hearty, substantive and unabashedly no-frills. The city that brought America Rocky Balboa and the Broad Street Bullies deserves no less in tribute.
Grease lightning · Though Whiz, a new Philly cheesesteak restaurant in Koreatown, might sound great in theory, it falls flat with poorly executed plates, greasy dishes and bizarre textures. The shop’s one saving grace? The Sweet and Spicy Basil Wings (pictured). – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
Whiz, a new Philly cheesesteak concept that opened up in Koreatown earlier last month, sought to bring the concept made famous by the likes of Pat’s, Geno’s and Jim’s to Los Angeles. It stands to reason that chef Wes Lieberher, the mastermind behind the artery-clogging menu at Beer Belly next door and the head chef at Whiz, would be the one to translate the hearty foods from the City of Brotherly Love. Unfortunately, Whiz falls victim to all of the Hollywood stereotypes of glitz without substance.
To call this a restaurant review would be a mistake because Whiz is not a restaurant. The indoor area is relegated to a cashier and a kitchen with scant standing room for patrons looking to order. There is no indoor seating, and there is no service staff, save for a sassy, tattooed cashier who seems to sincerely hate his job. Whiz would be more of a food truck stuck in a brick-and-mortar body, looking to make most of its business with take-out orders, deliveries and patrons who enjoy eating in their cars, or while standing up. There are a couple of benches adjacent to the sidewalk outside, but that wasn’t very helpful with the inclement weather of late.
What would make all of this perfectly acceptable is if Whiz actually made good food. It doesn’t. The signature item, the Whiz Wit, is Lieberher’s take on the Philadelphia favorite. The sandwich takes thinly chopped steak with a housemade “Cheez Whiz” and onions and puts them all in a nine-inch Amoroso’s roll. The supple-yet-substantive Amoroso’s roll, imported from Philadelphia, is a nice touch. The bread stands up well to the hefty grease of chopped steak. The problem is the sandwich itself: Despite fantastic bread, the meat completely overwhelms the taste of anything else in the sandwich. The restaurant’s eponymous Whiz is nowhere to be found, completely buried underneath a mess of unctuous grease.
The restaurant fares no better with its other sandwiches: The Balls O’ Bacon sandwich purports to be a spruced-up meatball sub, using pork shoulder meatballs wrapped in bacon in lieu of traditional meatballs. The marinara sauce is sloppily executed, under-simmered where the acidity of the tomatoes hasn’t been fully balanced and with cardboard-thick slices of garlic sprinkled throughout. One bite leads to an unpleasant revelation: The meatball crumbles away like overcooked falafel, with no discernible presence of bacon.
The Fried Chicken Sammy sounds excellent on paper: a tarragon panko-crusted chicken with applewood-smoked bacon, Italian mayonnaise and a spicy pickled jalapeno and carrot relish served up on a brioche bun. What’s troubling, again, is that the ideas are overwrought and poorly executed. The chicken arrives two shades darker than golden brown, overcooked to a chewy consistency that Ronald McDonald would find offensive. The applewood-smoked bacon is crunchy, and the sweet and spicy relish is nothing if not interesting, but the overall textures fail to work together to deliver a satisfying balance and the sandwich fails to amount to more than a sum of its parts.
It stands to reason that Whiz might be able to redeem itself with strong side dishes, but the Sriracha Beast Fries quickly do away with such pitiable expectations. The fries are a Sriracha-adulterated take on In-N-Out Burger’s Animal Style Fries, but Whiz’s rendition is decidedly half-a–ed. Crinkle-cut fries are topped with the restaurant’s Cheese Whiz, grilled onions and a Sriracha-Thousand Island dressing. The last ingredient is the most befuddling — the combination of the dressing and cheese is salty enough to make your stomach turn, and the addition of a spicy kick from a barely-present Sriracha is little more than a nauseating flourish.
To Whiz’s credit, their chicken wings are surprisingly good: The Sweet & Spicy Basil Wings are neither too sweet nor too spicy, but a neatly balanced combination of the two that brings out the fresh taste of Jidori Chicken. But if a sandwich shop’s claim to fame is its chicken wings, perhaps Lieberher needs to reconsider his strategy.
Whiz is open from 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., which suggests that it’s trying to be a lunch spot. It’s hard to imagine a place with such greasy, hearty food like Whiz providing lunch for the surrounding population of office workers. Mixing greasy food of this extreme with Excel spreadsheets and a mailbox full of emails is a recipe for disaster. Perhaps Whiz would do well to extend its hours to cover nights and after-hours, when its food could be the exclamation point on a night filled with regrettable decisions.

It is once again that time of the year — college students across the nation are scrambling to assemble their financial information in time to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and College Board’s CSS profile. This renewed interest in finances calls attention to the need for greater financial literacy  among college students. Along with navigating the maze of loans, credit cards and rent payments, students need to consider the long-term effects of their monetary decisions.
Financial literacy is about more than just saving up for a car or selecting the best student loan; it relates to making intelligent choices and forestalling financial collapse. Students between the ages of 18 and 24 spend about one-third of their income repaying debts, according to The Street. This should come as no surprise given that the average college student graduates with $25,000 worth of debt. Yet even after college, the majority of Americans do not improve their financial statuses.
A study conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission reveals that Americans do not have a strong grounding in “financial basics.” The SEC provides a list of the most commonly confused terms and cautions that lack of knowledge can lead to unwise monetary choices. Furthermore, less than 20 percent of parents talk to their children about finances. This “money taboo” impairs students’ ability to make sound financial decisions and increases their risk of incurring debt. U.S. News reports that students often commit to loans that they cannot repay, and more than seven million have defaulted on loans.
Though students are partially responsible for falling into predatory loans and making unwise pecuniary choices, the student loan industry is also at fault. Last Wednesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a lawsuit against ITT Educational Services for allegedly luring students into signing predatory loans, most of which had interest rates of more than 16 percent. Though it appears that the ITT officials took advantage of students’ financial confusion, this situation could have been prevented if students were more financially literate. Financial literacy courses, along with home economics and trade classes, seem to have fallen out of favor, students need to master these valuable skills.
Colleges are proactively educating students about money management. The Montana University system requires students with “above average” debts to complete financial literacy courses, coordinated by the university’s financial aid department. These courses allow students to put their loans into perspective and make plans to achieve financial stability.
Private universities are also taking steps to educate their students. The Yale Daily News reports that alumni have started hosting financial literacy forums to help address the issue. Even though home economics classes may not be the future of higher education, there is a clear need for basic financial education. Financial ignorance is not just an issue for college students — it plagues many demographics. The Society for Human Resource Management notes that in states with the lowest financial rankings, people tend to have lower incomes. Though it is unclear how much individual savings habits relate to personality, it makes sense that states with low financial literacy rankings should educate their populations about monetary matters.
Kentucky, which was given a grade of “C” in financial literacy by The Center for Financial Literacy, plans to establish a statewide financial literacy commission. This commission, outlined in House Bill 223, would help educate people about financial planning and hopefully improve the state’s financial health. People without sufficient financial knowledge rely on payday loans, take out high-interest mortgages and usually do not have retirement savings. Increasing financial literacy would increase financial stability and allow individuals to make wiser investments. Similarly to Kentucky’s effort, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is encouraging financial literacy by urging credit card companies to provide credit scores free of charge. According to CNN Money, most consumers do not understand the importance of their credit scores and do not know how to improve their financial reliability. Credit scores determine how much money lenders will give, influence interest rates on loans and can even be viewed by potential employers. This number provides a brief summary of an individual’s financial reliability and usually starts becoming prominent during college, when individuals apply for loans or lines of credit.
College is an ideal time to gain personal and economic independence. Aside from striving to graduate debt-free, students should take the initiative to master their finances. Financially literate individuals have the flexibility to invest in their education, expand their businesses and contribute to their community’s economic stability. Students must realize that financial knowledge is just as important as a college education — it is one topic they cannot afford to neglect.
 
Veronica An is a sophomore majoring in narrative studies.
 
I read with great interest this article on financial literacy. As a financial educator, I was pleased to read that young adults like Veronica are realizing the importance of financial literacy. Slowly but surely efforts such as the ones noted in Veronica’s column are taking hold, but the messaging must start with the young adults. Without buy in from you, the millenials, the effort will fail. 
Nonetheless, it is extremely encourage to see that the message is beginning to resonate with your generation. Taking steps in your college years to learn all you can about money, credit, and debt management will teach you lessons that you will carry for the rest of your lives. Start securing your financial future and improve your financial literacy.
For starters…potential college students need to find out which majors translate into something you can earn a living with after graduating.

We have more than one million words in the English language, according to the Global Language Monitor. These words have the power to cajole, to persuade, to encourage.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
But at times, we fail to recognize that our words have the power to transform the course of a topic as heavy as women’s rights.
A recent Pantene ad released in the Phillipines conveyed this idea in the most precise manner. In a series of different shots, Pantene successfully shows how different labels are associated with each gender. In one scene, the onscreen text reads “Persuasive” while a man is speaking at a podium. As the camera turns, a woman takes his place, and the text changes to “Pushy.” Likewise, an overworked man, neglecting his duties as a father, is labeled “Dedicated,” while his female counterpart is labeled “Selfish.”
Mashable calls Pantene’s work, along with Dove’s, pioneers of “women’s advocacy language,” showcasing the double standard intrinsic to our everyday life.
Examples of such language we use with men versus women are infinite.
At a World Economic Forum event on Jan. 27, 2012, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said, “Little girls are called bossy… But I challenge you to find someone calling a little boy bossy. You won’t see it. They’re not ‘bossy.’ That’s the natural order of things.”
AskMen published an article titled “Why Women Can Be Bitches.” The first sentence of the article states, “We all know the classic bitches: Women who speak their mind rather than bite their tongue.”
But would the same ever be said about a man? Arguably, no.
The effects of our language use is deeply troubling; it is this language that we use that further worsens the infamous “ambition gap.”
Sandberg has discussed the female ambition gap extensively.
“We teach women as young as 4 to lay back, be communal … we need our girls to be as ambitious to achieve in the workforce,” Sandberg said at the World Economic Forum Conference.
Women are seemingly socialized into the same gender roles. Though working as a hair stylist or a secretary, a babysitter or a nurse are certainly noble roles, it’s the men who we tend to see suited up, charging into boardrooms, briefcase in hand.
The ambition gap does not stop with executive roles. The biggest ambition gap, as demonstrated by numerous studies, exists in politics.
In one study conducted by American University’s School of Public Affairs, associate professor of government Jennifer Lawless and Loyola Marymount University professor of political science Richard Fox concluded that,“Young women are less likely than young men ever to have considered running for office, to express interest in a candidacy at some point in the future, or to consider elective office a desirable profession.”
Incorporating programming that addresses this issue is necessary for growth. Whether it’s implementing new campus initiatives or changing the way little girls are raised from birth, various avenues to close the ambition gap exist. But there’s one critical step that starts today: changing the way we speak.
At 11 years old, my younger sister is bright-eyed and beautiful: She dreams of growing up to become a doctor, growing up to save lives and battle diseases. Not only can I hope that this dream of hers comes true, but I can help it happen. It starts with calling her intelligent and not just pretty. It starts with calling her ambitious and not just cute. My words, our words, can restructure the way little girls and all women think about themselves. The time starts now.

A man who gets up early everyday to work at a job he is lukewarm about so he can provide for his family – that is called “NORMAL”
A woman who does the same thing – that is called “COURAGEOUS, DEDICATED, etc.
A woman who sits around the house watching TV and reading magazines all day long while the husband works – that is called a “DOMESTIC GODDESS”
a man who  sits around the house watching TV and reading magazines all day long while the wife works – that is called “LEECH, SCUM, etc”
Let’s not forget the hypocrisy runs both ways.

It makes sense that on the rainiest weekend in my nearly three years at USC, the mood of the USC men’s basketball team could be described as dour. After a Thursday night loss to Oregon State, the Trojans vowed to go out Saturday afternoon and win the final home game of five seniors’ college careers. But just as the Trojans kept up with their Pac-12 opponents, this time the Oregon Ducks, for the first 30 minutes, they faltered in the final 10. One field goal in the final nine minutes and a back-and-forth contest turned into a 15-point Ducks win.
It’s the same scene we’ve seen during most of the Trojans’ 15 Pac-12 losses so far. The team puts together a half of low-turnover, watchable and coherent basketball. And the team also compiles a long period, whether it be seven, 10 or 20 minutes, in which their opponent pours in buckets while the Trojans bumble on offense and become a sieve on defense, leading to the Trojans’ eventual defeat.
The issue is not that it happens. Every team blows basketball games at some point or another. The issue, instead, is that it’s happening almost every game. It’s certainly not intentional, but USC is breeding a culture of losing at basketball that goes beyond any one player on the court. Two years after winning just one conference game in a 6-26 campaign, this year’s Trojans head into their final two Pac-12 games with just one win over a conference foe.
“Everyone is frustrated that we haven’t won more games, but it’s not from a lack of trying or effort,” first-year head coach Andy Enfield said. “If you had asked us before the season, we would have expected to win more, but we’re playing some tough basketball teams.”
You’ll likely see pigs fly over the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before you have a coach or player admit they believe in moral victories. Yet it feels as if the Trojans’ season has turned into finding positives among the biggest negative: a loss. The Trojans did stay with Oregon for 30 minutes. They did cut a 26-point Oregon State lead to five. They did fight with then-No. 1 Arizona for a half. Those are my words and not those of anyone in the program, but as the season winds down, the sentiment seems to be, “We’ve been in almost every game,” as senior point guard Pe’Shon Howard said after the loss to Oregon.
The bigger issue heading forward is whether Andy Enfield’s squad will know how to win. Byron Wesley will head into next season as the only Trojan to see significant minutes at USC beyond this closing season, and he’s been part of programs that have gone 30-63 during his nearly three years here.
The talent level should be improved next fall, but the late-game experience is desperately lacking. USC only had one comeback this season worthy of praise, when they played at Dayton in December. The other two, against Northern Arizona and Cal State Bakersfield, were cases of an inferior team that the Trojans allowed to stick in the game much longer than anticipated. It’s meant more of a divot of a truth than an insult, but this group of Trojans has not shown the ability to win tough games at a college level.
The issue also lies in leaders, or in the Trojans’ case, a lack of them. Enfield mentioned the strange dynamic behind USC’s five seniors this season; it was harder for them to become instant leaders because two were only at USC for one season (Howard and D.J. Haley), and two more played at USC for two seasons (Omar Oraby and J.T. Terrell). And as we’ve seen over the past two years, Terrell and Oraby have been anything but consistent on the court, while Terrell has also had to fight to stay on it, missing eight games in November and December due to academic ineligibility.
Next year, the same issue might rear its ugly head. Wesley will be the veteran, but he leads by example on the court rather than vocally. The voice of the team might have to be Julian Jacobs, a freshman guard averaging 6.6 points and 3.6 assists, or incoming point man Jordan McLaughlin. Next year’s team will be young, and plenty of evidence has shown us that youthful teams struggle down the stretch of close games.
Considering that the current campaign is three, maybe four games from being over, the hope has to shine on next year. But though there’s excitement for new players to put on Trojan jerseys, there’s also the intangibles, such as leadership and finishing games, that need to be harped on as much as the actual playbook if the Trojans are to avoid another grueling season.

Truthfully, I am surprised at the single win USC got in conference.  It was certainly a shock for Cal.  I don’t think they figured that the starters would even have to play much at all.  The bench of all most all schools in the Pac12 would beat USC and they have.  That is why the games are close and then nothing at the end.  They are fresh.
I would just save the plane fare to WA and rest.  Head to Vegas and start gambling.  Luck will need to be on your side.  Don’t make hotel reservations for the night after the game.

After three straight weekends  traveling within California to compete in tournaments to open the season, USC’s women’s water polo team began conference play Saturday afternoon with a matinee battle in Tempe, Ariz. against No. 5 Arizona State.

The Women of Troy (13-0) were wading in familiar waters as they battled the Sun Devils (9-5) in early February in the semifinals of the Triton Invitational in San Diego.
In the first matchup, USC recorded a dominating 10-4 victory behind a hat trick performance by junior two-meter Eike Daube and five other scorers. But with tournament play over, the team must expect a different strategy from opponents, USC head coach Jovan Vavic said.
“With one game you have more time to prepare and when you have tournaments it’s so much more important to wear teams down,” said the 12-time National Coach of the Year. “If it’s only one game a week, even a team that may not be as deep can be dangerous because you don’t have to sub so much.”
Even with only one game to prepare for, ASU faced a problem the Women of Troy exposed in their first matchup. Just as in the first meeting, offensive production came from a variety of sources on Saturday.
The No. 1 Women of Troy made a big splash on the scoreboard early, surging ahead to a swift 3-0 lead. But ASU rebounded and plugged in a couple of goals of their own, temporarily slowing down the Trojan attack and cutting the deficit to two at the end of the first period. USC’s offense, however, would not be contained for long.
The Women of Troy exploded out of the break, registering four goals in the second period, creating a solid 8-3 lead heading into intermission. Freshman driver Stephania Haralabidis led scorers at the half, recording a hat trick, and junior driver Jennifer Stiefel accounted for two of her own.
“We started strong again  and we countered hard,” Vavic said. “In the second quarter, we continued to counter and just wear them down.”
In the second half, the Women of Troy exhibited no signs of slowing down. The five-goal advantage they brought into the half quickly increased to eight, as the Sun Devil defense showed no ability of containing the high-powered Trojan offense.
As USC built a 13-5 advantage in the fourth period, junior driver Monica Vavic replicated Haralabidis’ first-half showing with her own spectacular hat trick in just two periods.
Senior two-meter Colleen O’Donnell and senior driver Kelly Mendoza would tack on another goal each for the Women of Troy, generating a 15-6 lead as the final horn sounded.
In total, nine different players contributed to the ’SC scoring frenzy, piquing the interest of the head coach.
“[Monica] had a really, really good second half,” Vavic said. “It was an overall team effort with everyone scoring.”
After playing on the road for the first month of the season, the Women of Troy will finally play at home this weekend. They will place their undefeated record on the line during their home opener against Cal State Bakersfield, a team they defeated 21-1 last month in the first round of the UCI Invitational.
Even though playing at home creates clear advantages, Vavic insists playing in foreign territory is not a problem for his top-ranked team.
“The ultimate goal is to win a national championship and everything we do is to measure our goals and play our best,” Vavic said. “There is not a real difference [between playing at home or on the road]. Obviously at home we are familiar with everything, but the way we train and the way we play, it doesn’t matter where we play.”
This Friday will mark the program’s first game in USC’s brand-new Uytengsu Aquatics Center. Game time is slated for 5 p.m. Friday.

The Trojans faltered on Senior Day as they dropped their 10th consecutive game of the season to Oregon at the Galen Center on Saturday, 78-63.

It was the last game that USC (10-19, 1-15 Pac-12) would play in front of its home crowd this season, as the team goes back on the road next weekend to finish off regular season conference play before traveling to Las Vegas for the Pac-12 tournament.
For the Trojans’ five seniors, Pe’Shon Howard, D.J. Haley, Omar Oraby, Daniel Munoz and J.T. Terrell, it was the last game they would ever play at the Galen Center.
These seniors would combine for 41 of the Trojans’ 63 total points  while junior guard Byron Wesley tacked on 12 points for USC in the losing effort.
“[The seniors] played really good basketball and we saw that in the score, back and forth for 30 minutes,” said USC head coach Andy Enfield.
Howard, who transferred to USC from Maryland this season, led USC with 20 points, three short of his career-high 23, in his final game at home.
“Pe’Shon is really such a great player and he came out here and he really played his heart out,” Oregon forward Mike Moser said.
Oregon (20-8, 8-8) once again was too much to handle for the Trojans, however, who lost their eighth straight to the Ducks.
In addition to reaching the 20th victory plateau for the fourth straight year, Oregon also picked up its fifth consecutive victory on a rainy day that resembled the type of weather the Ducks are used to playing in back home.
The Trojans stuck around for most of the game, as the two teams went into halftime tied at 36.
At halftime, the 1954 USC Final Four team was recognized by Athletic Director Pat Haden for being the only USC team to ever reach the Final Four. But the good vibes from halftime did not carry over into second half.
The last time the two teams played in Eugene, Ore., the Trojans led the Ducks by four at the half before Oregon pulled away to prevail 78-66.
Saturday’s game would follow a  similar script as the Trojans trailed 61-60 with 9:21 to play, but the game slipped away in the final nine minutes, when Oregon outscored them 17-3 to pull away.
“I was really trying to get guys going in the second half toward the end, being aggressive,” Howard said.
But the Trojans just couldn’t keep up with the Ducks, turning the ball over 12 times in total compared to Oregon’s 10 and racking up 26 team fouls to Oregon’s 18.
“I thought we were playing excellent team basketball,” Enfield said. “We were making the right plays, we were making shots, and then we turned the ball over four or five teams during that crucial stretch.”
Moser was a force to be reckoned with for the Ducks in their scoring attack and on the boards, posting a double-double with 20 points and 12 rebounds to lead all players.
Oregon had three other players reach the double-figure mark with Joseph Young tallying 16 points and Jason Calliste and Elgin Cook adding 13 and 12 points, respectively, off the bench.
It has been a tough season for the Trojans, who went winless in the month of February and won only one game in January, against a respectable Cal team.
“If you would have asked us before the season, we would have expected to win more games,” Enfield said. “But, at the same time, we have played some good basketball teams, but they deserve credit as well.”
The ending to the 2013-2014 season resembles that of the 2011-2012 season, when the Trojans dropped 10 in a row to finish the season under former head coach Kevin O’Neill.
Unless they can pull off a win against Washington State next weekend, the Trojans will finish the regular season at the bottom of the Pac-12 standings.
“Besides our first five games, we’ve competed every game,” Howard said. “We go into every game looking to win.”
Though the team was selected to finish 11th in the preseason conference polls, few people thought that USC would end up with only one or two Pac-12 wins under Enfield in his first season as head coach.
The Trojans will try to stay out of the basement as they travel north to take on the Washington State Cougars and the Washington Huskies on March 6 and 8.
