USC’s women’s basketball team currently sits at 6-6 following a slow start to the season. After defeating LMU in their season opener, the Trojans dropped their first four games of Pac-12 play, forcing them to play catch-up from the get-go. 
Head coach Mark Trakh’s squad had a similar slow start last season, dropping their first five conference games before picking up three straight wins. 
This season, the Trojans again responded well to an early rough patch. They currently enjoy a three-game winning streak in conference play and have won four of their last five against Pac-12 opponents after starting 0-4. In its last week of action, USC picked up an overtime win against Washington State before falling just short of a second-half comeback in a disappointing loss to UC Riverside.
The improvement in conference play is not accidental, according to sophomore center Angel Jackson.
“We’ve just been trusting each other more, playing hard as a team.” Jackson said. “Our communication is getting way better, and that’s all we need on the court.” 
A notable absence from the team earlier this season was sophomore forward Alissa Pili. Pili was the Trojans’ leading scorer last season and 2019-2020 Pac-12 freshman of the year. She missed ten of twelve games due to an ankle injury, and made her season debut on Jan. 15 in an overtime win against Washington State. 
Trakh said Pili was playing well before her injury, and the team expects her to be fine once she’s able to get back to game speed. 
Pili’s absence has forced the team to make up for her production in scoring and rebounding. Graduate transfer forward Jordan Sanders has settled into Trakh’s rotation nicely, as she’s tied with junior guard Desiree Caldwell for the highest average of minutes played per game on the team at 31.9. 
Trakh said the transition process has been “easy” for Sanders, who spent three seasons at UC Irvine, given her ability to score. Sanders averaged 20.3 points per game in her sophomore season at UCI, good enough for second in the Big West that season.
Sanders’ scoring abilities have translated well to Pac-12 competition. Her average of 15 points per game is the second-highest on the team despite starting in less than half of the games she’s appeared in. Prior to Sunday’s loss to UC Riverside, Sanders had scored ten or more points in nine straight games.  
The brunt of the scoring load has been picked up by sophomore guard Endyia Rogers, who has also passed the ball well, leading the team in assists as well. Rogers has built upon an impressive freshman season, averaging 16.4 points per game along with 3.9 assists while shooting at an improved efficiency from the field compared to her freshman season. 
“She’s shooting the ball better, she’s shooting the three better, her assist to turnover ratios are good.” Trakh said of Rogers. “We’re very proud of her and how she’s improving.” 
While Rogers and Sanders have done well filling in for Pili’s production on the offensive end, Jackson and freshman forward Amaya Oliver have been effective in picking up the slack in the rebounding department. Jackson is averaging a team-high 6.5 rebounds per game, while Oliver is bringing down just below that at 6.2 per game. Oliver has also done well earning her teammates extra possessions, leading the team with 2.3 offensive rebounds per game.
Trakh’s team has had to be flexible with scheduling all season, as multiple games have been postponed due to issues with the coronavirus at numerous Pac-12 schools. Just two weeks before the season was set to tip off, the Trojans were forced to suspend all team activities after a player on the team tested positive for the virus. The chaos of this season has made team morale a crucial component of success, even more so than in previous years.
“The chemistry we have has been impressive,” said sophomore guard Kyra White. “We all just want to win and play hard for each other, and we’ve just got to be better.”
Despite strong chemistry, the uncertainty of the schedule has made it difficult for the Trojans to find rhythm and build consistent positive habits as the season progresses. 
“Coming prepared to practice, to games, to weights, to film, that’s where it all starts,” White said. “That’s where we have miscues sometimes, and we’re going to be better.”
To Trakh, a successful end to the season would include an NCAA tournament bid, something USC has yet to do in the first three seasons of his second stint as head coach. 
“It’s our fourth year here; I would expect that I want to go to the tournament,” Trakh said. “We’ve got to do it sooner or later, why not this year?” 
The Trojans have proven they are capable of competing with and beating the very best in the conference over the past two seasons, which probably explains Trakh’s hesitance to rule out a potential run in the Pac-12 tournament to secure an NCAA tournament bid.
The Trojans last qualified for the tournament in the 2013-14 season under former head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. USC currently sits eighth in the Pac-12, with matchups against every opponent in the conference left in the season.

The USC men’s basketball season began with a wild overtime victory against Cal Baptist in November. USC showed signs of potential on both ends of the court during the game but before the Trojans could establish some rhythm, their season was postponed for two weeks due to a team COVID-19 outbreak.
To make matters worse, USC began the season with seven new players and only one returning starter — sophomore guard Ethan Anderson. They lost veterans like guard Jonah Mathews and forward Nick Racocevic to graduation and forward Onyeka Ogonkwu to the NBA draft, where he was selected in the first round. 
The experience or a lack of playing time together has not been evident so far. Coming into the season, USC was predicted to finish sixth in the Pac-12 behind schools like Arizona and Arizona State. The Trojans have already defeated both schools this season. They’ve proven their talent beyond a sixth-place conference standing and currently own an 11-3 overall record and second place in the Pac-12. 
Several new faces have stepped up. Transfers such as former Santa Clara senior guard Tahj Eaddy, former Rice junior forward Drew Peterson and former Utah Valley senior forward Isaiah White have been regular contributors for a USC team that had very little time together prior to the start of the season. Another new face, freshman forward Evan Mobley, the highest-ranked recruit to ever attend USC, has been a revolution. 
USC’s depth was tested early when Anderson suffered a back injury in the Trojans’ third game that kept him out for nearly a month and a half. It was during this stretch that head coach Andy Enfield said he didn’t really know what to expect out of the team since few of the players they relied upon last year were there. 
However, while Anderson was recovering, the team began to click. Enfield had high praise for how they came together. 
“Everybody was brand new, and we were trying to put a team together and have them have a chemistry between them on the defensive and offensive end,” Enfield said in a virtual press conference Saturday. “I think they’ve done a great job, [I’m] very proud of how they’ve come together as a team.”
According to Eaddy, the Trojans’ performance thus far comes as no surprise to him. 
“I think this is an extremely talented team,” Eaddy said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I felt like this coming in the offseason. We were projected to finish six[th] within the conference, but I knew, with the talent we had, and all the length and the size, that we were capable of great things this year. So I knew we’re gonna do something special.”
To Eaddy’s credit, the Trojans really are doing something special. 
So far USC has allowed the third-fewest field goal percentage in the nation at 37% per game. They also lead the Pac-12 in rebounds and blocks per game. Standout freshman forward Evan Mobley has more blocks himself than the team totals for Colorado, Utah, Arizona State, UCLA and California.  
It’s a testament to the physicality of the squad. With eight players taller than 6-foot-7-inches, the Trojans are the tallest team in the nation. 
USC is also the second-best shooting team in the Pac-12, shooting 47% from the field per game, right behind Oregon. Mobley leads the team with an average of 16 points per game and is one of four players averaging double-digit points. 
Their recent play propelled them into third place in the Pac-12 and a NET ranking of No. 19 in the nation, as of Tuesday night. The NET rankings are used for the NCAA tournament in March, which Eaddy said the Trojans have a good chance of competing in. 
“You don’t want to always rely on your three-ball or your perimeter shooting and things like that. You want to be able to rely on the defense to be able to get stops when you need them,” Eaddy said. “I think us being an elite defensive team, I think that’ll carry over [and] allow us to play late in March.”
After dropping their first Pac-12 game against Colorado, the Trojans began an impressive run winning five consecutive conference games. This includes the two-game sweep over the Arizonas on the road for the first time since 1985 — a remarkable feat for a team that is fairly new. 
The exceptional play thus far from USC has demonstrated the promise of a team that can compete for a Pac-12 championship and possibly go far in March Madness.
Peterson kept it simple when asked about what it will take for them to do just that. 
“I think it’s just going to take consistency. One of our problems is not being able to shoot consistently, and I think we’re getting better with that and limiting turnovers, as well,” he said in a virtual press conference Saturday. “Consistency is what is going to get us this Pac-12 title and we’re ready to go for it.”
The Trojans’ ability to stay consistent will be tested during the second half of the season. The toughest part of their Pac-12 schedule is ahead with games against Stanford, Oregon and UCLA. It’ll be a great opportunity to see if USC can continuously compete against the upper rung of the conference. 
The Trojans’ next game will be Thursday against Stanford at 2 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
