 
With just a glance, one can tell Gilberto Cetina — chef and owner of Holbox, a Mexican seafood restaurant a few blocks off campus — possesses a great passion for food. However, it wasn’t always this way.
In fact, years before he owned Holbox and sister restaurant Chichén Itzá, he was averse to the idea of cooking. 
“My parents had been cooking and selling food since I can remember. They would give [my sister and I] this big container of warm, just-cooked chicken, and they would say, ‘Okay, you need to shred all this chicken for the tamales we’re going to sell,’” Cetina recalled, mimicking the motions of shredding chicken with his fingers. “That was me growing up … and I was like, ‘I don’t want to do this anymore, ever.’” 
Cetina was born in Mérida, Mexico, but lived in the United States for several years in the 1980s before moving back home. In 2000, he and his family moved to Los Angeles to support his father’s dream of opening a restaurant, which became the prominent Mexican restaurant Chichén Itzá. 
The restaurant shares a location with Holbox just east of the 110 Freeway inside Mercado La Paloma, a warehouse-like building with colorful walls and English and Spanish music spilling out of the speakers. 
Cetina situated his restaurants inside Mercado La Paloma because he saw that they could have an impact on South Los Angeles — an area he refers to as a “food desert,” with its limited access to both nutritious and affordable food. 
“A big part of the idea behind [Mercado La Paloma] was to counterbalance the excessive number of fast food restaurants and liquor stores in South L.A.,” Cetina said.

Cetina created Holbox, named after an island off the coast of his native Yucatán Peninsula, out of a desire to put a creative twist on the area’s traditional cuisine. 
“Chichén Itzá is a traditional Yucatán-style restaurant and for me at least, by definition, that means that it’s pretty much static,” Cetina said. “I needed something where I could do something new every day, and that’s where Holbox came [in].”
With his glasses and salt-and-pepper beard, Cetina looks scholarly, but the knowledge he seeks is not in dusty libraries; it’s in the raw fish he handles every day.
“I think fish is beautiful,” Cetina said. “Each fish has its own character, its own characteristics and way of handling. Each fish requires you to learn a new way of cutting it … and each one has its own little nuances.” 
Cetina attributes his love of seafood to summers spent in Yucatán during his childhood and teenage years, diving for spearfish, octopus, lobster, shrimp and conch.
“On the way back usually there was a little ceviche action on the boat where we would quickly chop something up, rinse it off in seawater, and then we would always take some tomatoes and onions and cilantro,” Cetina recalled with a gleam in his eye. “That is my go-to flavor memory for ceviche: really fresh fish, just simply prepared and raw. We just cured it for a minute in lime juice and we would eat it.”

Years of practice and a learned expertise are obvious in Holbox’s Ceviche Mixto, a tostada shell piled high with fish, shrimp, octopus, tomatoes, onions and cilantro — reminiscent of the dish Cetina described from his childhood. The tostada shell is thick but crunchy, and the ceviche is topped with avocado puree and salsa roja, bringing a duality of creaminess and spice to the dish.
Cetina was trained in computer science, so when his father opened Chichén Itzá, he became “front of the house” for his family’s business, which meant running operations rather than making the food.
But he became more receptive to cooking when Chichén Itzá opened a second location in MacArthur Park and hired a new chef to run it.
“I would find myself in the kitchen all the time … correcting things that I felt were incorrect because I was used to how my dad would do them,” Cetina said. 
Then, during a birthday celebration at the MacArthur Park location, his dad gave him a roll of chef’s knives as a present — and asked him to take over the kitchen.
“That was important. That was validation . . . because it felt to me like it wasn’t okay and like it wasn’t my place,” Cetina said. “After that day, I knew it was allowed, that I [was allowed to] cook, and that’s when it all started.”
After closing the MacArthur Park restaurant, Cetina returned to Mercado La Paloma to work side by side with his dad, and eventually took over kitchen operations completely.
 Finally, a year and a half ago, he created Holbox. The restaurant is a physical manifestation of his love for cooking; it took a long time to get there, but now that he’s found his passion, he’s going to stick with it.
“Just try to make the most memorable, remarkable food that will make people happy and things will fall into place,” Cetina said. “I’m not in a hurry … I just want to continue making good food.”

Dariel Filomeno | Daily Trojan
On Sept. 17, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced the rollout of the city’s latest initiative to combat homelessness: a multi-series, $20 million plan to move people off the streets and into temporary shelters known as “bridge homes” for the next three years. 
“Homeless Angelenos can’t wait years to get off the streets,” Garcetti said at a press conference in El Pueblo. “We need more options for bringing them inside now.” 
This initiative comes after a series of permanent housing programs that unsuccessfully attempted to mitigate the city’s growing homelessness epidemic. In the mayor’s words, these bridge homes are unique in that their goal is “to serve as a rest stop on the path to permanent housing.”
But, despite its noble intentions, this initiative’s promise to alleviate street homelessness rings hollow. The first of the temporary shelters, located in the El Pueblo district, cost the city approximately $2.4 million, yet will only house 45 individuals. This is only about 1.5 percent of L.A.’s homeless population, excluding those who stay in shelters overnight. Given the amount of funding the program has received, the results so far are disappointing. Garcetti’s inability to follow through with his campaign promise of achieving zero homelessness is not just due to poor execution of large-scale initiatives like this one; his overall approach to tackling homelessness is misguided. 
“There’s no question that homes are the cure for homelessness,” Garcetti said of the bridge homes in a news conference last Wednesday. 
Garcetti’s statement indicates how he does not understand the root causes of homelessness. According to L.A. Family Housing, the leading causes of homelessness across L.A. County are a lack of affordable housing, unemployment and poverty, all three of which are deeply intertwined and complex issues. To provide a long-term solution to the homelessness crisis, these factors must first be addressed. This means lowering the cost of housing, creating jobs and addressing the root causes of unemployment — including health obstacles, family problems and lack of access to education. 
Garcetti has addressed unemployment extensively throughout his time in office, championing job creation as a focal point. His crowning achievement comes with his “10,000 Strong” veterans hiring initiative, in which he surpassed his goal by employing over 10,500 veterans in a variety of industries. But in a city characterized by its high cost of living, employment may not be enough for residents to afford rent. According to a study by the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, L.A. renters are allocating an average of 47 percent of their income toward rent, making the city the most unaffordable rent market in the country. To meet the criteria for affordable rent, residents should only be spending 30 percent or less of their paychecks on housing. Given the lack of affordable housing units in the market, this means renters must earn an average of $42 per hour, a standard far above the city’s minimum wage of $10.50, and far above what residents of the bridge homes are earning. Without a high source of income or access to economical living units, bridge home residents will have no choice but to return to the streets after their stays are up, and Garcetti will be no closer to his zero homelessness goal.
Economists have identified a shortage of homes as another reason for the lack of affordable housing. While Garcetti has attempted to address this crisis with an initiative that aims to build 100,000 new housing units by 2021, only 15 percent of those living spaces are required to be financially accessible to the low-income families who need them most. The bridge homes opened this week are only meant to be temporary while new residences are in progress. If only a small fraction of new L.A. houses are built to be affordable for low income individuals, most residents of the temporary shelters will continue to struggle to find permanent housing once their stays are up. 
Although Garcetti’s bridge home program has been lackluster so far, it does have redeeming qualities that provide hope for further success down the line. The bridge homes are built around existing encampments, which city sanitation teams will restore into walkways once the residents have settled into their bridge homes. In this way, the initiative is minimally disturbing to both the homeless population, who can stay in an area that is familiar to them, and to the residents of the neighborhoods surrounding these former encampments. Additionally, the communities surrounding each bridge home will be equipped with mental health resources, career advising and substance abuse support — all of which directly address some of leading causes of homelessness in L.A. County. 
Considering these factors, Garcetti’s intentions appear to be in the right place, but whether the remainder of his initiative will be implemented successfully remains unclear. To ensure greater success of his anti-homelessness initiatives, he must take a more multifaceted approach, such as the one taken by Houston’s Homeless Outreach Program. This program assigns teams of police officers and mental health professionals to address the root causes of homelessness on an individual, case-by-case basis by assisting citizens with medical challenges, obtaining social security cards and other services. If Garcetti wants to fulfill his promise of zero homelessness, he will have to look past getting the homeless population into houses and begin tackling the multitude of issues that drove them out of homes in the first place.

On Sunday, the Senate Judiciary Committee reached a testimony deal with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school. Ford committed to testifying on Thursday “despite actual threats to her safety and to her life,” according to her lawyers in a New York Times report. 
Ford publicly came forward with her accusations last Sunday, and in the time since, she has faced a barrage of threats and harassment from sources both online and in-person. Her personal information, including her home address and phone numbers, were leaked on Twitter, and unsubstantiated rumors began circling online — so much so, that the Times had to write a story titled, “Debunking 5 Viral Rumors about Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh’s Accuser.”
Ford is a victim of doxxing, a form of online harassment in which an individual’s personal documents — finances, social security number, phone numbers or addresses — is disseminated online with the intent of harassment. Yet as of Thursday afternoon, Slate magazine reported that her personal information was still being circulated on Twitter, and was not removed until after the story was published.
This is concerning; Ford’s name is now nationally recognizable, but it took at least four days for a social network to address the continued circulation of her personal information. Due to the sporadic nature of doxxing, victims of this online abuse, especially those who are not as well-known as Ford, suffer for a sustained period of time before the harassment can be contained by intervening social platforms. Most victims are women, who are more likely to experience sexualized forms of abuse, The Conversation reported. 
This form of online abuse has existed since the internet’s conception, but as social networks grow, the threat of doxxing becomes even more real. In 2014, a targeted attack toward women in the video game world began circulating on Twitter through the hashtag #Gamergate. Anonymous trolls gathered in online forums like Reddit and 4Chan to post rape, death and doxxing threats against female developers. 
This behavior, as abhorrent as it seems, is representative of the misogynistic and sexist elements of culture that still exist within society and are only amplified online. For women who exist with an opinion on the internet, especially those with large social followings, anonymous harassment is a likely occurrence. Young women between the ages of 18 to 24 experience particularly severe forms of online harassment, from stalking to sexual harassment, according to a Pew Research study. 
Ford is at the center of one of the most high profile political events this year. While her sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh are scrutinized in the limelight, there is little acknowledgment in Congress or in the news about the targeted virtual abuse women like Ford receive after they come forward with their stories. Most of these women are already grappling with the trauma of the allegations they are publicly leveling, and with social media, their personal information and digital history are searchable, and consequently, closely examined. 
Misinformation can be damaging and rampant, as seen in Ford’s case. Snopes found that a thread on 4chan’s /pol/ “politically incorrect” section was created to dig up dirt on Ford and “prove that she is a liar.” The users on this thread not only posted derogatory and sexist comments, but also circulated a false photo of a middle-aged blonde woman, suggested to be Ford, protesting Trump. Falsely equating Ford’s political ideology to her allegations is a tactic that aims to undermine her story, and could further incentivize violence or retaliation toward her, especially if she is falsely cast as having political motivations to harm Kavanaugh’s reputation.
Studies on online harassment from Pew Research Center have found that men are more likely to experience some form of abuse than women, but 64 percent of men find that offensive content online is taken too seriously while 63 percent of women believe that people should feel safe and secure online. 
Given how quickly Ford’s profile has become elevated, it’s inexcusable that tech companies are not paying more attention to the abuse she is facing and the misinformation associated with her name. A cursory acknowledgement of the threats and abuse women face online is not enough; more stringent privacy and protection laws and regulations must be adopted. 
When it comes to virtual abuse, the gendered violence women face is often normalized as a consequence of free speech on the internet. The misogynistic accusations that Ford is politically motivated and the threats she receives should not be an inevitable consequence for publicly speaking out about an alleged traumatic event, something that Ford will forever be affiliated with, moving forward.

In 2016, a New York Times reporter named Michael Barbaro had just been promoted full-time to the newspaper’s audio team. Or maybe it was demoted. “Am I ever gonna be in the paper again?” a colleague remembers Barbaro asking, according to a Vanity Fair article from last year. 
Two years later, Barbaro doesn’t seem to have any qualms about the value of podcasting. On Thursday night, he spoke at The Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles with two colleagues, Caitlin Dickerson and Annie Brown, in a special talk titled “The Daily: Immigration in the Trump Era.”
Barbaro, a former business and political reporter, honed his podcast hosting skills in The Run-Up, the political twice-a-week podcast that followed the 2016 presidential campaign. Listeners were fascinated with the explanatory format, which featured a slew of Times reporters and political guests, and The Run-Up  reached No. 2 in the iTunes podcast rankings.
Barbaro was one member of a tiny audio team The Times assembled to take on a new wave of political reporting in the wake of the 2016 presidential election. The Run-Up had worked. But listeners – and reporters – wanted something more.
And so The Daily was born. The podcast was named the most downloaded new podcast of 2017 in Apple Podcasts. It reaches 4.5 million listeners each month, executive producer Lisa Tobin announced at the Code Media Conference in August. And Thursday’s packed event in the 1,600-seat theater suggested that people truly do want to know the stories behind the stories.
“The way that The Times stories have been written for so long – and I think this has changed a lot in the last few years – it was kind of the voice of God. ‘You got the news, you’re welcome for the news, if you have any questions about the news, in small print, here’s a number you can call,’” Barbaro told the audience on Thursday. “I think that that has lead to a lot of confusion about what the media is and about how journalism works.”
The Daily, Barbaro said, operated differently. The New York Times and other news organizations were criticized for their coverage of the 2016 election, particularly in failing to note the growing support for President Donald Trump, as a consequence of being too distant from a large number of Americans. But the podcast aims to bring viewers closer to how the news is reported and lift up the voices of many in the country who would otherwise not be heard.
The trio on stage epitomized how The New York Times has assembled a winning audio team. Dickerson, a national immigration reporter who has broken numerous stories regarding deportations, detentions and most recently, the White House administration’s child separation policy, is a frequent guest on The Daily. Brown is an audio production mastermind, and even though she is mostly behind-the-scenes producing and editing, has also appeared on the show as a guest.
Together, they worked to produce a show that was not only coherent, but strived for perfection.
“There’s this story that has become kind of mythic within the producers, and it’s of the night before the first episode was published,” Brown said. “Michael just could not say the date with any gravitas. So we spend an hour going over and over the date, each producer kind of trying their hand at coaching him through it.”
Barbaro also spoke on the impact that he thinks the podcast has left on listeners and how it has built a stronger relationship with the newspaper’s readers. 
“It’s so much harder to distrust a reporter like Caitlin when you see her process that suddenly transparent to you, and there’s no longer a tablet being handed down to you,” he said. “It’s certainly changed my whole approach to this.”

Once the groove of a new school year starts to finally set in — when freshmen look like they know where they’re going and seniors feel like they don’t — the campus is also greeted with the true signifier of another spin around the academic calendar: the release of U.S. News and World Report’s Best College Rankings. 
The merit, accuracy and basic relevance of these rankings have long been contested — perhaps even to the point of irrelevance. Maybe they matter; maybe they don’t. More interesting, however, is the increasing influence of hierarchical rankings on the minds of prospective students: UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute found that, in 2016, 63 percent of college freshmen in the U.S. ranked the importance of a school’s reputation as “high” in their college decision. 
For those privileged enough to have agency in selecting colleges, the craving for an external signal of status concerning one’s choice can appear a prerequisite. (Harvard’s famed “Z-List,” a deferred admission list that requires students take a gap year and that largely favors legacies with pre-college records lower than most admitted students, shows that the mythos surrounding an institution’s prestige is as valuable as the prestige itself.) 
For USC, however, the notion that reputation will largely impact students’ college selection throws an existential wrench into our current operations. This year, USC had a record-low admission rate with 13 percent and its highest matriculation rate with a 4 percent increase — and, arguably, the most scandal-ridden year in University history. Should students continue to rely heavily on a school’s reputation in their college selection, the logical trend in USC admissions would be downward, with fewer applicants.
While the incoming class of 2018 made their decisions before USC’s scandal-filled summer, they’ll be the last class to do so. In the future, students will be locked into an ethical bind that might not be commonly shared with their counterparts. The next cohort of students may feel tasked with transforming themselves into the 35 percent who do not rank reputation as “very important” in their college choice, in order to justify acceptance of a school so clearly rocked by scandal. 
The disparity between USC’s public image and its increasingly selective admissions process logically forces one to contemplate the accuracy of national rankings — of “reputation” — and whether or not they matter at all. But it also begs us to ask a question more commonly posed by freshmen who just read Jean-Paul Sartre for the first time, if anything matters. 
Should students continue to flock to USC, the cynics might say “no.” But to be this cynical would require tremendous ignorance. To say that incoming students “choose” an institution is an immensely privileged claim. Many incoming college students — in years past and in years to come — may find reputation very important, but still lack the resources to attend the reputable school they dream of. Therefore, students lucky enough to attend USC, with its 13 percent admission rate, No. 22 spot on 2019 U.S. News Best College Rankings and ethical shortcomings, should not be blamed for what, in many ways, may be a decision outside of their grasp. 
Instead, like national movements around us, we must hold those with power accountable and empower those without it so that they can properly function within the same system. It is in everyone’s best interest to continue to attract and retain the dedicated student body that USC has long cultivated. To do so, we have to examine the power imbalance between the students who choose our school and the systems that run it. 
If USC can be the poster child for anything this year, it’s likely for the argument that what one does, so long as one is powerful and wealthy, will bear no relation to one’s status. Consequently, if potential students continue to apply in the droves that have characterized recent years, we should not accuse them of complacency. Rather, USC must keep itself in check. While a number of watchdogs kept USC accountable by reporting on multiple scandals last year — namely, the Los Angeles Times — the future responsibility for such action now falls entirely on the administration’s lap. 
When those who abuse power are exposed, it’s possible for them to emerge relatively unscathed — whether with a stand-up set or a Supreme Court nomination. Power has this ability. And, it seems, USC does too. Now, to set the record straight, USC must use its power responsibly.
