The USC women’s soccer team used a goal and three assists from super-sub Alyssa Dávila to beat No. 25 San Diego 4-0 on Friday at McAlister Field.
The junior midfielder had a hand in all four of the Women of Troy’s goals, as USC (8-3) stretched its winning streak to seven games.

“My teammates have been making really good slashing runs,” Dávila said. “They made it easy for me to get assists.”
The game was scoreless for much of the first half, with both teams enjoying stretches of good play.
San Diego created several good opportunities through sophomore forward Stephanie Ochs, including a low shot in the 13th minute that was saved by USC senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen.
The Women of Troy responded in the 26th minute when freshman forward Samantha Johnson received a pass from midfield and fired a shot to the near post, forcing a reaction save by Torero goalkeeper Courtney Parsons.
Dávila, who has only started one game this season  despite leading the team in both goals and assists, entered the match in the 33rd minute and helped USC grab the lead soon after.
In the 40th minute, freshman defender Stephanie Morgan crossed a ball in from the right flank that Dávila flicked on to sophomore forward Ashley Freyer in the penalty box. Freyer posted up her defender with her back to goal, then turned and fired a low shot past Parsons and into the far corner of the goal.
Freyer’s first goal of the season gave the Women of Troy a 1-0 lead heading into the halftime break.
In the second half, San Diego began to put USC under pressure and created several goal-scoring opportunities.
“USD made some adjustments that we struggled with in the beginning,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “They made it difficult for us to complete passes.”
The Toreros were unable to capitalize, however, as Olsen came up with two big saves.
In the 60th minute, Toreros freshman forward Maggie McGuire charged up the right- hand side of the field and fired a shot to the near post, only to see Olsen make the save.
Four minutes later, Ochs sent in a cross that found defender Natalie Garcia wide open in front of USC’s goal. Olsen charged hard to recover and made a sliding fingertip save to preserve the lead.
“I think she’s one of the best, if not the best, goalkeeper in the county,” redshirt senior defender Meagan Holmes said. “Every game we have to count on her to step up big for us, and she does it.”
Buoyed by the solid play of their goalkeeper, the Women of Troy went on the offensive and doubled their lead in the 80th minute.
Dávila dribbled the ball up the middle of the field and passed it to redshirt senior Marihelen Tomer near the top of the penalty box. Tomer swung the ball outside to charging sophomore midfielder Carly Butcher, who smashed a right-footed shot through the hands of Parsons and into the top right corner of the goal.
Dávila  grabbed her third assist in the 85th minute, taking a long ball on the left side of the field and centering it to a wide open Johnson in front of goal. Johnson calmly tapped the ball into the net for her third goal of the season.
The Women of Troy completed the score line in the 87th minute, when Dávila got onto the end of a cross by senior forward Jamie Petrossi and shot it inside the near post for her fifth goal of the season.
“She’s a real intelligent player, and whenever she comes off the bench for us she creates opportunities like crazy,” Khosroshahin said about Dávila. “It’s her role, she’s embraced it, and she comes in and makes the difference for us every game.”

BERKELEY, Calif. — USC students made their way back from Northern California fully satisfied as the No. 7 Trojans breezed past No. 24 Cal 30-3 Saturday at Memorial Stadium.
USC made it look easy in a game that was supposed to be its most difficult test of the season. The Trojans dominated every aspect and put together their best all-around performance of the season in front of a crowd of 71,799.

After a rocky three-week stretch that saw the Trojans squeak past Ohio State, get upset by Washington and then underperform against Washington State, everything seemed to come together for USC on offense, defense and special teams.
“I am really fired up about a lot of good things that are happening,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “This is a win we take a lot of pride in. We are just going to keep on pushing.”
Cal looked like it would put up a fight when it marched down the field with ease on its first possession to the Trojans’ 6-yard line. But all the Golden Bears’ momentum vanished when quarterback Kevin Riley rolled out to the right side and threw an ill-advised pass that was intercepted by senior safety Taylor Mays in the end zone.
“We looked a little shaky [on the first drive] but the defense has always come through,” redshirt sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo said. “And we’ve been awesome with our backs against the wall this year.”
Mays’ pick silenced Cal’s early statement and the USC offense took over from there. The Trojans moved the ball 80 yards in six plays, capped by a highlight reel-worthy 38-yard touchdown run by running back Joe McKnight where the junior dove past two defenders and stretched out just enough to get the ball across the plane for a score.
“It was a big tone-setter for everybody on the offense and plus for the whole team,” McKnight said.
Carroll said the immediate response by the USC offense carried even more weight than Mays’ interception.
“Even better than [the interception] was the drive after that, 80 yards down for the touchdown,” Carroll said.
After McKnight’s touchdown, the Trojans scored 13 more unanswered points to finish what was perhaps their best half of football this season. McKnight scored again in the fourth quarter to lead the Trojans with 121 yards on 20 carries.
USC’s first-half dominance was highlighted by receiver Damian Williams’ 66-yard punt return for a touchdown. Williams found a seam up the middle then tiptoed along the sideline before diving toward the pile-on for the score.
The redshirt junior, who took over full-time punt returning duties this season, was pleased after his first career punt return for a touchdown.
“I caught the ball and all 10 guys in front of me made great blocks,” Williams said. “It started with Garrett Green. He made pretty much the springing block in front of me and I only had to beat one person, and that was the punter.”
Although he did not throw a touchdown, freshman quarterback Matt Barkley had his most consistent performance of his career, going 20-of-35 for 283 yards with one interception. The offensive playbook seemed to fully open up for the first time this season, allowing Barkley to take shots down the field.
“I think they’ve had that faith [in me] this whole time, we just decided to it open up now,” Barkley said. “I’m confident that the coaches believe in me and they do.”
While the Trojans were racking up points, Cal’s offense failed to get going after Riley’s interception. The USC defense limited Cal running back Jahvid Best to 49 yards on 14 carries.
“We felt like we had control at some points in the game, but it just wasn’t happening for us,” Best said.
With the Heisman hopeful unable to get into a rhythm, Cal became one-dimensional, and the onus was on Riley to beat the Trojans with his arm. But the pass defense held as well, holding Riley to 14-of-40 passing with 199 yards and one interception.
“We were zero-dimensional today, because we couldn’t run it and we couldn’t throw it,” Cal coach Jeff Tedford said.
Cal avoided the shutout when kicker Vince D’Amato’s 29-yard field goal in the fourth quarter gave Cal its only points of the game.
“The consistency of our defense is just great,” Carroll said of the squad that held Cal to 285 yards in total offense. “We love the guys [on defense] that left [to the NFL], but the guys that are here are playing really good football.”

BERKELEY, Calif. — The story: With Stafon Johnson hospitalized and unable to talk, the Trojans did all their talking on the field Saturday.
Most of the players had Johnson’s initials or 13, his number, written on their eye black. Many said he was in part of their thoughts throughout the game. Many said he inspired them to win.
Heavy hearts · Damian Williams and many other Trojans showed they had Stafon Johnson on their minds by writing “13” on their eye black. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
And with a balanced, well-rounded performance not yet seen out of the Trojans this season, No. 7 USC (4-1) dominated Cal 30-3.
Johnson underwent emergency surgery last Monday after dropping a weight on his throat in Heritage Hall. Johnson’s presence was tangible after the game.
“I was really happy that we could play this game for Stafon,” freshman quarterback Matt Barkley said. “He was in our hearts the whole time. It was a great victory for us and for him.”
Meanwhile, the No. 24 Bears (3-2) suffered their second consecutive embarrassing loss after falling 42-3 against No. 16 Oregon last week. And Cal’s ballyhooed preseason All-American running back Jahvid Best was again shut down, gaining just 51 total yards.
Key play: Cal drove down the field quickly to start the game, with an eight-yard run from Best, a facemask called on USC and two 20-yard strikes from quarterback Kevin Riley putting the Golden Bears in a goal-to-go situation. But USC senior safety Taylor Mays made a leaping interception off a Riley throw in the end zone to stop the looming threat.
“We knew it was an early test for us, but we handled it,” said redshirt sophomore middle linebacker Chris Galippo. “Taylor just totally shut the whole stadium down with that interception.”
The Trojans turned around, scored in six plays, and never looked back. Cal wouldn’t get on the board until the fourth quarter.
“I think it was a great statement that we weren’t going to let [a Cal touchdown] happen,” Carroll said. “And even better than that was our drive after. We took advantage and drove 80 yards for the touchdown.”
Added Galippo: “People can see how much turnovers can mean with that one.”
Most valuable player: Running back Joe McKnight. The 6-foot, 190-pound junior rushed 20 times for 119 yards and two touchdowns. He didn’t fumble and lost yardage on only two carries — two weaknesses that have plagued him in the past.
“He’s fast and explosive,” said Cal linebacker Mike Mohamed of McKnight. “He’s pretty good.”
Surprise performance: Allen Bradford had 53 yards on a career-high 12 carries as he established himself as the Trojans’ No. 2 running back behind McKnight. The redshirt junior didn’t break any long runs — a 16-yard rush was his game-high — but he did rush for three first downs and provided a change of pace from the speedy McKnight.
“I’m a big back, so I have to be able to get key yardage,” Bradford said. “My role is extended, so I know I have to step up.”
Carroll had said that Bradford would be depended on more in the coming weeks. McKnight noted his teammate’s progress.
“He’s gonna get better and better,” McKnight said of his backfield mate. “And he’s gonna have a bigger role against Notre Dame.”
Stat of the game: The Trojans were flagged just five times for a total of 55 yards. That number — especially when compared with last week’s first quarter total of seven penalties for 75 yards — displayed the team’s increased discipline.
“You could say that we were clicking on all cylinders tonight,” redshirt junior linebacker Michael Morgan said. “Not as many mistakes, not as many penalties.”
Quote of the game: “It’s about time.”
The Trojans said it was about time for a lot of things after the game Saturday.
“It’s about time Damian returned a punt for a touchdown,” said redshirt freshman receiver Brice Butler.
“It’s about time Taylor had an interception,” said redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams. “I’ve been telling him to get one for the last two years. That was a huge play.”
Added Williams: “And it’s about time for us as a team. I think we finally solidified why we’re one of the best teams in the nation.”

The bounce is back.
USC’s dancing and chest-thumping on the sideline may be nothing new for the fans or players, yet each hop and step seemed more emphatic than the moves the Trojans made in their sluggish first four games of the year.
Rebound · Junior Joe McKnight had two touchdowns against Cal. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
And for a USC team that had not lived up to its own standard of play, Saturday’s 30-3 romp against Cal was a welcome demonstration of the Trojans’ confidence.
The match at Memorial Stadium was an exhibition of swagger against reticence, with USC embodying the side of certitude. And though the Trojans have never lacked self-assurance in their approach, the blowout in Berkeley was the first time this year that the team played like it knew the outcome was predestined.
“We’ve known we were capable of that, but it’s been a long time coming,” USC coach Pete Carroll said.
This was the USC that television pundits had promised fans — long touchdowns from the offense, turnovers from the defense and gutsy calls from the coaching staff. This time, it all started with the stars.
As USC’s starting quarterback, freshman Matt Barkley has had to be a leader by default. But on Saturday he showed how he’s taken on the team image — and vice versa.
Barkley told reporters earlier in the week that he didn’t think Cal’s crowd would be a factor after enduring the raucous noise at Ohio Stadium.
The Cal student section took offense and distributed fliers with the quote, instructing fans to make Barkley eat his words. One of the sheets of paper even made it into the signal-caller’s helmet before the game.
“I thought about trying to pump up the crowd when we were on offense, but I don’t think it would have worked,” Barkley said.
Not that the USC offense needed much pumping up — 457 yards and 30 points was more than enough for a Trojans’ attack that still left plenty of points out on the field.
“The way the offense is moving around is really starting to feel familiar to us, like the way we did it in the past,” Carroll said. “We’re doing it with confidence, but it’s just taken us a while.”
With Barkley allowed to throw downfield and test an occasionally suspect Cal secondary, USC’s passing attack showed it can pick up yards in large chunks.
“I think they’ve had that faith this whole time, but we’ve decided to open it up now. We’ll open it up whenever we need to,” Barkley said.
The faith shown in the offense may not be enough for those still expecting the offense to produce as it did when Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush were around, but consider USC’s opponent on Saturday before filing a formal complaint.
Despite entering the game with the Pac-10’s most productive offense, Cal coach Jeff Tedford looked like he was holding his breath on every play.
Somewhere along the line, Tedford forgot that he could actually give the ball to his most talented player instead of only using him as a decoy. Cal tailback Jahvid Best only touched the ball on 16 plays and disappeared for large stretches of the game.
“It was frustrating,” Best said repeatedly while shaking his head.
Even on their home field, the Bears were terrified to take chances. Down 20-0 in the waning seconds of the first half, Tedford elected to kick a field goal on 2nd-and-10. Fans booed the decision as the kicking unit trotted out to the field and weren’t too thrilled when they saw the field goal sail wide right.
By the second half, the team looked as deflated as its cheering sections did. Instead of running out onto the field for the third quarter, Cal players looked like they were filing out of an office building during a fire drill.
“When you get on them early, it’s tough for the crowd to stay in it,” redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams said. “They just get demoralized.”
Given Cal’s shakiness, it’s hard to tell what the Trojans took away from the win. The Golden Bears were once mentioned as a Rose Bowl contender, but at this point, they might settle for a bowl sponsored by a manufacturer of men’s grooming and fragrance products — I’m looking at you, Brut Sun Bowl.
Regardless of the opponent, USC showed how difficult of a team it is to beat when it’s not stumbling over its own feet with penalties and turnovers.
“I think we showed tonight why we’re one of the best teams in the country,” Williams said.
USC still has plenty to improve upon — third-down conversions still aren’t optimal, and three drives inside the 10 only resulted in field goals. But with a bye week on the horizon, the team will get a good look at its flaws.
And if Saturday was any indication, the Trojans should have enough hop in them to bounce back from those mistakes, too.

It’s becoming vogue to combine the seemingly separate genres of horror and comedy, but it’s a tight line to walk. For every Shaun of the Dead or Slither, you have a Zombie Strippers! or a Snakes on a Plane, turning even the most novel idea into a rambling train wreck that doesn’t know where its heart lies. But as charismatic lead Woody Harrelson proclaims near the beginning of the film, “It’s time to nut up or shut up” — and Zombieland definitely isn’t the kind of movie that plays it soft.
Stylistic, vulgar, rapidly paced and edited, Zombieland pulls no punches from the opening montage, where protagonist Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) fills us in on the apocalyptic wasteland that is now planet Earth. A neurotic college student who spends his days and nights playing World of Warcraft, Columbus has a  self-insulation from society that actually makes him a natural-born survivor; as he tells it, being wary of other people has progressed to being wary of zombies. Over a sequence of violent and riveting shots of America descending into chaos, he lists a number of often hilarious guidelines that he uses as rules for staying alive, such as Rule No. 3: “Always check the back seat,” or Rule No. 1: Cardio.

“All the fat people died first,” Columbus deadpans.
Along his travels through America, Columbus eventually meets up with Tallahassee, the shotgun-toting, whiskey-drinking redneck played by Harrelson, who requests they only be known by the cities they originated in. Zombieland doesn’t bring anything revolutionary to the end-of-the-world yarn; the unlikely duo teams up, meets another unlikely duo in sisters Wichita and Little Rock (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, respectively) and makes a journey filled with twists and turns that  ends up in a Los Angeles amusement park.
Zombieland is a script that begs to be filled out, a thin plotline running westward across America with little to no purpose besides a vague mentioning of the final destination as one free of zombies (in Los Angeles? Sure!). Of course the similarly aged Columbus and Wichita are going to find romance. Of course the rock-hard Tallahassee is revealed to have a tender side and a tragic past. Of course there is going to be the obligatory amounts of gunplay and gratuitous gore that Shaun of the Dead made acceptable. And, of course, there’s going to be a wild ending that doesn’t make half as much sense as it’s supposed to.
But surprisingly enough, despite its thin plot, a seen-it-before style and stereotypical characters, something about Zombieland just clicks. Much of the credit goes                                                                                                                                          to Harrelson and Eisenberg, the latter doing his best Michael Cera imitation and coming off less a bland clone and more a hilarious, accurate representation of a maladjusted young adult thrust into a situation where he routinely has to blow some heads off. The former, meanwhile, clearly steals the show: A brash, confrontational vagrant who seems to have found his calling in offing zombies in the most creative ways possible and has an odd craving for Twinkies. Harrelson has the best lines by far and relishes every second, turning his beer-swilling cowboy caricature into the most badass protagonist in any zombie movie in recent memory. The two play off each other effortlessly, Columbus the straight man to Tallahassee’s lovably unhinged warrior.
Even better, first-time director Ruben Fleischer moves the action along fluidly, and the comedy or horror never feels stunted or too heavily weighted in favor of one or another. These zombies are fast (think 28 Days Later) and mean; when the camera zooms in on their ravaged faces and vomiting mouths, you’ll forget all about witty one-liners. Although Stone essentially re-plays Jules from Superbad with a penchant for thievery and an itchy trigger finger, Breslin seems to be finally shedding her prepubescent image here. And while the movie veers toward the unrealistic when the foursome reaches Los Angeles (something tells me post-apocalyptic Los Angeles wouldn’t include deserted freeways), it also holds the movie’s best part, a hilarious drawn-out cameo that I won’t ruin here.
It’s a movie that sets out to have as much fun as possible, and, from Tallahassee’s relentless hunt for Twinkies to Columbus’ laughably awkward heroics, it without a doubt succeeds. Zombieland won’t break any new ground in the horror-comedy world like its biggest influences, nor will it receive any points for creativity, but it is a movie that will entertain again and again. In the end, that’s perfectly OK.

What do you scream when feeling pleasure? If you’re Subject No. 14, “Victory for the forces of Democratic Freedom!” is the first thing that comes to mind. If you’re Subject No. 14, you’re also starring in Brief Interviews with Hideous Men.
So, let’s just assume that you aren’t Subject No. 14, Subject No. 34 or any subject number for that matter. The one thing that can be assumed, then, is that you are either a man or a woman, and you have interacted with other men and women in your lifetime. Perhaps your world is fixed and knowable. You’ve learned enough about members of the other sex to truly believe that you understand them, and you have lived comfortably in your knowledge for most of your lifetime.
Q&A ·  Brief Interviews with Hideous Men explores facets of relationships through various interview segments. - Photo courtesy of IFC Films
Well un-know what you know and think more along the lines of John Krasinski and his feature film directorial debut.
Let’s concede that to think like Krasinski, you must also think like David Foster Wallace, the author of the novel Brief Interviews with Hideous Men, which Krasinski adapted for the screen. Krasinski first came into contact with the idea for the script during his time at Brown University, when his friends were producing an onstage version of the material and he was invited to perform.
While Krasinski is most recognizable as the adorably nerdy Jim Halpert from The Office, his acting in Brief Interviews is more compelling than anything he has yet to star in. The film itself may be one of the most powerful of this year.
Although his scenes are limited, Krasinski plays an absolutely critical role in the film and in the character development of co-star Julianne Nicholson (Kinsey, Law and Order: Criminal Intent), who plays Sara Quinn. Quinn is a graduate student conducting a series of interviews in order to discover what men essentially think about women, and how women’s actions throughout history have affected men’s views.
Quinn pieces together data from countless men, obtained either by formal interviews or overheard conversations. Each man has a different story, expressed very differently to Quinn, but most have a similar strain: emotional instability. While women are often pegged as the emotionally unstable partners in modern relationships, Brief Interviews provides some insight to how men are often the more strained, tormented and fragile of the pair.
In one interview, Subject No. 40 explains how he uses his amputated arm to get women into bed; in another, Subject No. 46, talks about how rape can be a beneficial experience for women. What audiences realize by the end of the film is that Krasinski’s Ryan — Subject No. 20 and coincidentally, Quinn’s ex-boyfriend — is actually the most insightful and honest “hideous male” of all. None of the men are able to reveal their real issues, their inner workings and the true way they perceive women, and superficial analysis of important events or traits (like an amputated arm) and overly dramatic theories (like rape being a positive occurrence) mask what they are truly feeling.
The breakthrough for Quinn comes only when Krasinski’s character delivers an intensely emotional performance, his “interview” being an explanation to Quinn about their past relationship. This scene is one of the most powerful moments in the film not only because of its unique spin, but also because of Krasinski’s performance. It almost appears as if Krasinski had held that scene in his mind for years, perfecting it and casting himself in the part because he felt that only he could achieve the chilling effect his monologue exudes.
What is more surprising about Brief Interviews is not the serious tone or nature of the film (although the film begins with witty writing, it is inherently depressing) or its inadvertent theme of honesty, but the performances delivered by each  member of the cast. From the subject who screams obscurely about democracy during pleasure to the eerily somber and humbling subject who speaks about his father’s occupation to the laughable subjects whose stories play with one’s mind, each and every actor manages to deliver a memorable performance. This is considerably noteworthy, since the cast of subjects is rather large.
While Quinn’s research stands as the main plotline, this part of the story simply moves along. It is the interview scenes that shine brightly — exactly as Krasinski intended. The scenes where men are in the midst of their interview telling Quinn, a woman they have likely never met, more about themselves than even they could realize, are the driving mechanisms of the film. Although none are particularly honest, what the men do decide to tell Quinn is wholly indicative of their character; the audience and Quinn can see right through them. This emotion is where the viewer’s interest lies, what inspired Krasinski to act in the first place, and what Wallace wrote about in his book. As a result, what the viewer comes away with is not necessarily enlightenment, but a fresh perspective on the male sex.

Sex happens. On college campuses, it’s viewed as almost inevitable, from the freely available ’SCondoms to the raunchy movies and TV shows everyone watches. Because of this, everyone will probably know a few good “sexile” stories.
For non-collegiates, sexiling refers to a sticky situation where one roommate may find his or her room occupied by a roommate’s sexual encounter, and is forced to find some other place to sleep or study.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Sexiling is a strange two-way street: It’s a terrible thing when you’re the one being sexiled, but it’s a privilege you’d want to have if you had a special someone over.
Across the country, sexiling seems to have become an unspoken allowance — because, hey, what’s the harm of not being able to enter your room for an hour or so? Be cool, man.
Tufts University recently brought that unspoken practice to the spoken realm when it formally forbade sexiling in on-campus housing. Tufts’ 2009-2010 housing handbook articulates the rule as follows:
“You may not engage in sexual activity while your roommate is present in the room. Any sexual activity within your assigned room should not ever deprive your roommate(s) of privacy, study, or sleep time.”
Of course, the university did not articulate whether it was forbidden if said sexual activity was engaged with said roommate.
What seems like an amusing policy in which the university extends its authority all the way to one’s bed is actually politically and socially complex.
One side of the debate says it’s ridiculous and unenforceable; sex is going to happen regardless of policy. Sexually charged college students aren’t going to stop and consider consequences.
After all, having to deal with others’ sexual activities is a real-world experience that forces roommates to discuss certain issues. A five-minute discussion establishing the meaning of a sock on the doorknob could make a policy unnecessary. Without the dorm room, students may have a hard time finding another place to have alone time.
The other side of the debate argues the new policy is a necessary measure to protect a student’s privacy and mental well-being. Anyone could have difficulty confronting a roommate they’ve heard making animalistic grunts inside their room.
Even worse is if the sexual activity actually takes place in the presence of the roommate under the false assumption that he or she was asleep.
Not everyone can point out the indecency of such an act as it takes place. And because sex in college is less of a stigma and more of a staple, limiting a roommate’s trysts could come off as prudish. Nobody wants to feel like the little kid who’s crying, “I’m telling!”
Legally, a roommate has no right to keep another roommate out of the room. It’s supposedly common sense to have mutual agreements about the etiquette in these situations, but that’s not always the case. Whether it’s because an increasing number of students are still immature as they enter college or because the culture of “hooking up” is getting out of control, putting sexile rules into formal university policy says something depressing about our abilities to handle these situations.
The policy at Tufts is looking like a sadly comical social experiment other American universities will be looking at with interest. Perhaps such a policy will go out the window in a year or so. Or, it could end up being a policy enforced at USC someday. It might have seemed like leaving the watchful parents’ home to live at college meant sexual freedom yesterday, but today’s rules are coming down harder.
Sexually active students need to take the responsibility to communicate and compromise with their roommates — ultimately, the decision should come from the student, not the administration.
Because, let’s face it, nobody wants to be the person standing outside texting their roommate at 2 a.m. to see if it’s okay to go back inside the room.

The most unforgivable vice of ripped-from-the-headlines televisions shows like Law and Order: SVU — beside implying that all women who work in New York precincts shop exclusively at TJ Maxx — is that they lead the public to believe that most cases of rape and murder are cleanly solved in the span of a few weeks.
In reality, the United States is currently facing a formidable backlog of unsolved rape and murder cases — at least 350,000  nationwide — that are in bureaucratic limbo awaiting DNA testing. Our very own Golden State’s Department of Justice houses one of the largest testing bottlenecks in the nation, which has only grown since Proposition 69 passed in January mandating that all arrestees be tested.
Even US cities with relatively low crime rates are facing daunting workloads — and nationwide budget cuts to staff have not made the process any quicker. Detroit has as many as 10,000 samples on the backburner; Houston has about 4,000.
As it turns out, one of the few cities making any real progress is our very own. In 2008, LAPD admitted that there were approximately 7,500 so-called “rape kits” in public storage awaiting testing. On Monday, LAPD Chief William J. Bratton announced in a letter that in the course of one year, the amount has been reduced by about 50 percent — to 3,157.
This is the result of a concentrated initiative spearheaded by Bratton and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in 2008 — an initiative other states would do well to follow. The two made plans to outsource DNA testing to outside labs and allocate more funding for hiring staff.
By the numbers, the effects are far from negligible. Since 2008, 405 of the kits tested have turned up matches in state databases.
LAPD has not been lauded as of late, but officials deserve a well-earned kudos for these efforts. Assuming they are held to task, the Los Angeles DNA backlog should be eradicated by 2011.
The push proves that the allocation of funds in this sector yields concrete results. California is not the only state to be in a dire budget crisis, but it has been the first to make drastic reductions to the large number of festering cases.
Unlike cop shows, these are problems solved in real time.

Every day I check my email, hoping a certain message is there.
No, it’s not an acceptance letter, a message from my boss or a shipping confirmation for those amazing shoes I just ordered.
It’s my Google Wave invitation — and it still hasn’t come.
Of course, I could get one on eBay for upwards of $200, as some of the world’s most affluent techie dorks have done. I could give my email to a website that promises me one, inevitably filling my inbox with offers from beta programs I don’t care about. I could retweet @GoogleWaveNow, spamming my followers and hoping to be randomly chosen as a winner (OK, maybe I already did that). Or I could wait patiently like the rest of the world until the communication system changes my life forever.
When it comes to understanding Google Wave, this patience is a virtue. Hardly anyone who is not a web developer or super-geek knows what the tool is, and that’s because the only way to really understand it is to: a) Wait for an invite and see for yourself, or b) Watch an hour and a half-long video.
The video, which can easily be found by Googling “Google Wave,” is from the Google conference this past May. It shows a complete walk-through of the platform and is chock-full of corny one-liners from its creators.
After suffering through one too many awkward silences resulting from developer and Software Engineering Manager Lars Rasmussen’s bad jokes, you can finally understand what the system does — and it truly is exciting.
The creators describe Google Wave as what email would look like were it invented today, as opposed to in the 1960s, before the advents of SMS, instant messaging, wikis, blogs or other media-sharing tools. The program attempts to combine a number of the Internet’s best features into one, and, from the video, Google Wave seems to do a really, really good job.
The crowd “oohs” and “aahs” as the developers demonstrate messaging through Google Wave, which is like email made simple and, most importantly, instant. The system works faster than an IM, basically sending each character as it is typed. Of course, you can turn this function off, but Google Wave has gone out of its way to allow for this immediate mode of communication to happen when both users are online.
This instant element is one of Google Wave’s biggest advances, though, personally, it scares me a little. While immediacy is pretty fantastic when sending pictures and attaching files, I find communicating with sentences and paragraphs effective enough. I also average more typos than your standard computer lover, and I try not to burden my contacts with the usual “teh” in my email’s first draft.
Got typos? Google Wave has got a solution. With a statistical spell checker that accounts for grammar, language and common usage patterns, there is no need for patrons to concern themselves with the order of letters in a word. According to a video about Google Wave’s natural language processing, Google feels that, “if people could just loosen up a little bit and type five times faster, then that’s 5 percent less time that they’d spend typing.”
Wait a minute: Is taking our time such a bad thing? Apparently yes, as every technological advance we have seen has had some basis in improving our efficiency. From the wheel to the Internet, each step forward has been concerned with saving time, consolidating efficiency or being the most productive for the least amount of effort. The purpose of progress has been to simplify our lives and create free time, only to fill that free time with higher expectations and demands. Google Wave perfectly exemplifies this paradox of convenience many of us love to hate.
Soon, the whole world will start using Google Wave or some version of it. We will never have to wait longer than 10 seconds for multimedia content or one second for text communication. We will think, “Oh, now that I can make plans instantly, I have so much time to kill!” We will kill that time by making more plans and executing them as quickly as possible. Expectations of quality and speed will rise across the board, and, before we know it, we will be characters in the movie Wall-E — victims of instant gratification who can’t even spell words on our own.
Is Google Wave the cause for this apocalypse of intellectualism? Not exactly. It’s merely another step in the logical direction of a society that just can’t quit improving. And whether this is a good or a bad thing … I’ll let you know when I get that invite.

A while ago I wrote about the problem of students stalking professors. Closer relationships between students and instructors don’t always indicate stalking though— it might just might indicate a mutual interest in, say, the role of unicorn imagery in 16th century French poetry .
Well, no one’s ever been interested in that.
But what if the mutual interest isn’t actually mutual?
Take this example of a student who tries tempting her T.A. into an illicit tryst so he will boost her grade—clearly, she did not anticipate that it would be so difficult to seduce a faculty member.
She probably also did not anticipate that her T.A. would leak their conversation to the internet.
Woops! If only she had taken the hint early on, maybe she wouldn’t have resorted to saying “Why don’t u come over tonight and we can discuss my grade in the morning?”
Makes you wonder though— surely there’s a more effective way to seduce your instructor than Gmail. Maybe they should add a Blackboard app?
