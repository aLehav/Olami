The USC women’s volleyball team traveled to Salt Lake City and carried the lingering effects of its UCLA win with it, defeating the University of Utah 3-0 (25-22, 25-21, 25-13) Sunday to improve to 12-1.
Serial killer · Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio recorded 16 kills and four service aces in the Trojans’ 3-0 win over Utah. The Women of Troy pushed the attack and overwhelmed the Utes in a 25-22, 25-21, 25-13 victory. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
“I thought it was a good win. This is a hard place to play with the altitude,” USC head coach Mick Haley said. “I thought we [put forth] a great effort and were very alert. We executed extremely well. To get out of here with a 3-0 win is pretty special because [Utah] plays well and they have a big arena which makes it hard to play.”
After a high-octane victory over the rival Bruins Wednesday night, the Women of Troy had to hit the road and face a daunting Utah team that entered the match 12-1. But after two tight sets, USC cruised through the third set to capture its second consecutive Pac-12 victory.
Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio continued her tear with 16 kills and four service aces for a total of 20 points. Her freshman counterpart, Ebony Nwanebu, hit .412 with nine kills while junior outside hitter Emily Young (8) and junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer (7) combined for 15 kills.
The first set saw back-and-forth action in which neither team was able to build a lead of greater than three points. After a flurry of ties, Bricio knocked down consecutive kills and Nwanebu blocked a Utah shot to put the USC lead at 20-17. The Utes battled back to come within 22-20 and 24-22, but freshman setter Alice Pizzasegola fed Bricio for a kill that sealed the set. Bricio recorded a stellar nine kills in the opening frame as USC collectively hit .389 and recorded 19 kills.
“We’re usually susceptible to those hitting errors when you’re on the road, but I thought our offense played well today,” Haley said. “We recorded 19 kills in the first set which is very good production for us. I’d still like to reduce the hitting errors by about two per set, but it’s a work in progress and it was a good effort today.”
The second set mirrored the first in the outset but USC built a 14-9 lead after four straight points, including two service aces by Bricio. The Utes stormed back and eventually pulled to within 21-19 after a kill and a block, but the Women of Troy stalled any comeback hopes. Nwanebu recorded consecutive kills to bring up match point and then sealed the match with another kill at 25-21. Senior libero Natalie Hagglund recorded 12 digs in the middle frame alone to keep Utah’s attacking percentage at .178.
Unlike Wednesday’s match, the Women of Troy took care of business in the third set itself, storming out to a 12-6 lead on a kill by Young. Utah failed to put a dent in the lead, and USC doubled up the Utes 24-12 with senior outside hitter Sara Shaw knocking down an ace in between two Bricio kills. Utah recorded a kill but then sealed the match for USC with a serving error.
After a nine-point victory in the fourth set to retire the Bruins Wednesday, USC recorded a 12-point triumph over Utah in the third set, putting to rest any hopes of a comeback.
“I hope that we’re wearing the opponents down, but I think our serving is a constant attack on the opponent,” Haley said. “Our blocking is much better this year so I think we’re constantly putting pressure on our opponents. If they flinch and they blink, we’ve been able to separate, and we’d like to keep that up.”
The Women of Troy will return to the Galen Center this week to face their two Northern California rivals. They will square off against Stanford on Friday night and UC Berkeley on Sunday afternoon to continue their Pac-12 schedule.

The No. 2-ranked USC men’s water polo team got back in the winning column Saturday with two blowout wins over No. 11-ranked Princeton and Whittier in their home opener at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
Making a splash · Senior driver Nikola Vavic recorded two hat tricks in the Trojans’ two victories this weekend. The Trojans started slow in their first game back since their loss to UCLA in the NorCal Tournament earlier this month, but recovered to finish off the Princeton Tigers 22-4 and the Whittier Poets 23-2 this weekend at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The doubleheader began with the Trojans netting a 22-4 win over a strong Princeton team and immediately following it up with a 23-2 rout of Whittier for the second time this season. With the pair of wins, USC (12-1) also extends its 30-game home winning streak.
This comes just a week after crosstown rival UCLA snapped the Trojan’s 41-game winning streak in the championship game of the NorCal Tournament 9-8.
USC started slow against Princeton, as both teams were scoreless in the first four minutes.
The Trojans, however, would start their offensive outpour soon after beginning with a goal by senior two-meter Connor Virjee. With that goal, the team would take a 1-0 advantage, and there was no looking back from there as redshirt junior driver Zach Lucas put a goal in just 30 seconds later.
The theme of the day for the Trojans was “spreading the love,” as eight different Trojans netted USC’s first eight goals and 13 different USC players scored on the day.
The main emphasis of the day though, according to USC head coach Jovan Vavic, was not offense but defense.
“We really wanted to focus on playing better defense, and I felt like we did a much better job with our half-pool defense,” Vavic said.
Redshirt sophomore two-meter player Mac Carden came up big for the Trojans against Princeton. Carden had four goals on the day, but had great defensive intensity as well.
“[Carden] had a lot of steals on defense today and was playing harder than anyone on our team, which was motivating us to raise our intensity,” senior utility player Mace Rapsey said.
The Trojans were up on the Tigers 10-4 before a 12-goal offensive outburst that gave them the 22-4 win. Drivers Lucas, junior Kostas Genidounias, senior Nikola Vavic and Rapsey had hat tricks in the win, while senior two-meter Jeremy Davie and junior driver Marc Vonderweidt also had multigoal games with two each. Senior James Clark recorded double-digit saves in goal with 10.
“We had a great scoring day on offense and it was nice to see so many people getting on the board,” Vonderweidt said.
Following a short break, the team continued its scoring run against Whittier, blasting 11 straight goals into the back of the net to take a big early lead. The Poets would eventually get on the board late in the first half with a man-up goal by attacker Nicholas Beavers.
Eleven different USC players would score against the Poets and a plethora of players would have multigoal games led by Genidounias, who had four. Vavic, redshirt junior Ivan Kustic and Carden also had hat tricks. Sophomore Aleck Ryner and redshirt junior Paul Mitre would relieve Clark in goal and netted eight saves in a combined effort.
And though the elder Vavic was happy with his team’s performance on defense, he wasn’t very impressed with his team’s large scoring output, mainly because of the many goal-scoring opportunities that it didn’t capitalize on.
“We basically missed 15 one or nobodies today, so we need to do a much better job finishing and be more focused in those situations,” coach Vavic said.
USC will stay at home and jump into Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play next Saturday, Oct. 5 against UC Irvine. Game time is set for 1 p.m.

When Marqise Lee went down with a left knee injury in the opening moments of the fourth quarter of Saturday night’s game against Arizona State, it surely seemed like that would be the most significant news to come out of USC football this weekend. Sure, the Trojans were being manhandled by a Pac-12 opponent, but the result of the game took a backseat to the broad effects of the loss of the former Heisman candidate.
Had Lee torn his ACL? Had we seen the last of him in a Trojan uniform? Would he remain No. 2 on USC’s all-time receptions list behind his old running mate Robert Woods?
But the real bombshell wouldn’t come until 4:35 a.m., when USC’s athletic department released an e-mail statement announcing the long-anticipated dismissal of former USC head coach Lane Kiffin. Suddenly, all speculation centered not on Lee, but on the state of the entire USC football program.
As Lee was taken off the field on Saturday night, the cart transporting him didn’t have room to turn around on Arizona State’s narrow sidelines. So it simply rolled in reverse at a glacial pace up into the tunnel leading to USC’s locker room, as Lee managed to flash one of his trademark grins despite the pain that was surely coursing through his leg. Nothing has been confirmed about Lee’s injury, but it’s never a good sign when the entire team huddles around a fallen player.
Lee’s slow exit from Sun Devil Stadium was the perfect metaphor for the plight of the football program under Kiffin, who compiled a mediocre record at Troy (28-15) and lost 7 of his last 11 games as head coach. Even when the Trojans did win, it rarely came with the perceived effortlessness in blowouts and the sexiness that came along with the high-powered offenses and dominant defenses, all of which were common throughout former coach Pete Carroll’s tenure. As the Trojans kept on backing up and regressing with Kiffin behind the wheel, Haden merely sat in the backseat and grinned.
That is, until now, as Haden has delivered the final blow to Kiffin’s tenure.
When Kiffin was asked the first question about his job security at Saturday’s postgame press conference, redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, who was on deck for interviews, let out an audible sigh, shook his head and rolled his eyes. It was clear he thought that the blame for the team’s flaws should not be laid at his coach’s feet.
So USC’s players did seemingly stay loyal to him until the end, never criticizing Kiffin or whining about his playcalling — something that could have happened on a team that contained immature, spoiled players or a coach that didn’t have control of his team.
But Kiffin’s most widely-recognized redeeming quality, his recruiting prowess, was hardly shaping up to be a strong point this season. With just seven verbal commitments so far from the class of 2014, the Trojans are ranked as having the No. 63 class in the nation by Rivals.com, only better than two other teams in the Pac-12.
Recently, the main knock on Kiffin has been his performance as an offensive coordinator and playcaller. Concerns were initially roused by the deflating loss to Notre Dame last year before peaking in this year’s matchup against Washington State, when the Trojans’ offensive game plan was more appallingly conservative than the crowd at a Donald Trump rally.
But what finally got Kiffin fired was his shortcomings as a head coach and as a leader.
As the third quarter wound down, the Trojans found themselves deeper and deeper into a hole inside the canyon of Sun Devil Stadium. Behind 48-21, USC’s sideline was absolutely barren of emotion — much like any interaction Kiffin has ever had with the media. Some coaches would have tried to rouse their team with an inspiring go-get-’em speech, or at least a few words of encouragement and pats on the back. But it was clear no such inspiration would be coming from Kiffin — not then, and not during any future showdown at the Coliseum.
So now, as the Trojans are staring down the barrel at another substandard season in Los Angeles, USC’s situation seems to be even bleaker than it was at the conclusion of last year’s historically disappointing campaign.
The squad is down to two healthy scholarship receivers after losing Lee to that gruesome knee injury. The offensive line seems lost in pass protection. The once praised defense now appears to be in shambles after facing its first Pac-12 road test.
And now it is no longer Lane Kiffin’s responsibility to try and fix those problems — USC fans, you can now exhale — but don’t expect the rest of this season to be any prettier now that the elephant in the room has been cut loose.

To all those who criticize the early morning firing, there is something you are failing to consider. It was done this early so that USC and Los Angeles as a whole would not erupt into a media rage calling for his head in the papers and other media outlets on Sunday. USC’s ability to recruit this season was already negatively affected by the Washington State loss that caused an outburst of rage. A second outburst would only serve to hurt USC more. While you can say SC fans should have known better that is a nonsense argument because rage is defined by letting your anger over come your reasoning. After that 3rd quarter in the desert rage was coming on Sunday. Pat Haden did the right thing and nipped in the bud before it could happen.
Yes, it is true that Pat Haden didn’t hire Kiffin, the former AD did, Mike Garrett, the man who stood in front of a microphone and blazenly told a group of the school’s sports boosters that the 2010 NCAA report was “nothing but a lot of envy.” Garrett went on to say “As I read the decision by the NCAA, all I could get out of all of this was … I read between the lines and there was nothing but a lot of envy, and they wish they all were Trojans,”
That shows what kind of respect USC leadership in 2010 were showing the NCAA….and does anyone WONDER why the NCAA org. will not give USC a break?  At least on implementation of the 2010 sanctions.
USC is a great, elite tier school in sports, nothing to be ashamed of….but the cocky attitudes towards the NCAA and rest of sports world has got to stop. Kiffin was just as guilty of this in his persona, with all the stupid little tricks he played on sidelines with jersey trading, ball deflating, etc. Everyone that has any sense knew it was not the student team manager who decided on his own to deflate balls. all these little tricks and comments about USC football aided in pushing Kiffin out the door, and the team down the tubes.  EXTREME hope that the team and their long time assistant coach can push on and fight on to become better, in MANY WAYS.
I was in the fire Kiffin camp.  However, 4am at LAX is just wrong.  They couldn’t wait the 20 min it takes to get back to SC from LAX.
He might have been leaving to go somewhere else, and that is all they could do, OR they might have wanted to ‘control’ what was said to the press in LA, before he left the airport. Large organizations always want to ‘control’ the press and getting LK at LAX was probably thought to be best way to end any issues with LK talking to press or getting questioned by LA press.
I have never understood all the hype about Kiffin anyway. Glad he fled in the middle of the night from TN. #karma #vol4life
First, Pat Haden didn’t hire lane Kiffen.  Lane seemed never to hold the respect of the University, its alumni and the media.  He was a “non entity” in a University with a glowing history dating far beyond my own history of over 60 years.  Yes, Lane was saddled with the toughest and most outrageous sentences by the NCAA in my memory, and all because of the rule breaking of one dishonest player, but he never measured up to our own high standards as a leader of the University.  Time now to forget this man whom we put into the wrong position and focus on building the future of one of the greatest institutions of learning in history.  Fight On, USC!
Clueless Pat Haden has no idea what he is doing.   A mediocre hire is on the way.
Time to rally around the coaches and the team. Haden’s proactive decision gives the coaching staff and players valuable time to adjust and get ready for Arizona. Everyone loves a Cinderella story. Let’s stay forever hopeful that this season has a happy ending. Let’s have fun one game at a time. The stands will be rocking for the Arizona game.   Fight On.
John, I agree wholeheartedly. Further, this is very poor modeling for students of conflict resolution. Also, if I were a  prospective coaching candidate, Haden’s behavior would give me pause before accepting working under Haden. Perhaps Haden needs to be “pulled off the bus as well”, though in more professional manner.
I agree.  As a parent, I’m disappointed in the seemingly “public shaming” of the coach.  All USC Coaches/Professors, etc.  are role models for the students.  Is this the behavior we want our students to model?  I think not.
Perhaps Kiffen deserved to be fired, but he did not deserve to be fired in such a demeaning way in the middle of the night, if the report in the Daily News is accurate.
If Pat Haden had any class he would have waited until later  on Sunday (or even Monday) to dismiss the coach in a business-like way in the athletic office.

This weekend, USC’s trip to the desert started with a tough loss to Arizona State and snowballed into the firing of former USC head coach Lane Kiffin immediately following the team’s flight back to Los Angeles.
On Saturday night in Tempe, Murphy’s law reigned over the USC football team — anything that could go wrong, did. Arizona State scored 28 points in the third quarter to lock up a 62-41 win and junior wide receiver Marqise Lee was carted off the field with a left knee injury.
Offensively incompetent · Former USC head coach Lane Kiffin lost his last game as a Trojan on Saturday against the Arizona State Sun Devils. News of Kiffin’s firing came early Sunday morning following the loss. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Then, after the team’s flight back to Los Angeles early Sunday morning — after 12 months of whispers, chants and then near-begging from the Trojan faithful — Athletic Director Pat Haden relieved Kiffin of his duties, in a press release sent at 4:35 a.m. Sunday morning.
When Kiffin was asked if he would be bothered by further questions about his job security following the defeat, he responded, “I’m fine with that. I have been dealing with that for 12 months … We have to find a way to coach better and play better and get our backups ready.”
That much is clear following the latest deflating loss suffered by the Trojans — but Kiffin won’t be the man to oversee that rehabilitation.
Entering Saturday night, USC (3-2, 0-2) hadn’t allowed many points in the third quarter this season. The Sun Devils (3-1, 1-1) made quick work of the Trojans’ halftime adjustments at Sun Devil Stadium, scoring three touchdowns within the first 5:05 of the second half to turn a game that many were expecting to be a defensive battle into a rout. With that scoring streak, the Sun Devils erased USC’s tenuous one-point lead and severely damaged the Trojans’ odds to win the Pac-12 South.
“It was a tough day for Trojans today,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said. “People were just blowing assignments and doing the wrong things … It was just the perfect storm for us.”
The Sun Devils’ 62 points were just one shy of besting USC’s school record for points allowed, matching the record of 62 points Oregon compiled against the Trojans last year.
It was a stunning turnaround after USC only allowed 44 points combined in its first four games.
“I don’t think anyone thought there’d be 100 points scored with these two defenses,” Kiffin said. “Unfortunately we didn’t play good defense today. We gave up a bunch of explosive plays, a bunch of back-shoulder throws.”
After redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden raced for a 24-yard touchdown less than a minute after halftime to give USC a 21-20 lead, the Sun Devils punched in 28 unanswered points in the third quarter.
Tailback D.J. Foster hauled in a 74-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Taylor Kelly to give the Sun Devils the lead at 28-21, and redshirt sophomore Cody Kessler threw an interception on the Trojans’ ensuing drive that was returned 46 yards for a touchdown. After a USC three-and-out, tailback Marion Grice hauled in an 8-yard touchdown reception from Kelly to polish off an insurmountable 48-21 lead going into the final period.
“I think a disastrous third quarter for us was a big part of the game,” Kiffin said. “[Kelly] really threw the ball downfield and made a bunch of plays.”
But the worst news had yet to come — after Lee returned a punt to midfield, the former Heisman candidate stayed down on his back as teammates slowly started to kneel around him in a circle on the field, setting a surreal scene.
After the game, redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble said that Lee’s injury was examined and that “whatever he got looked at came back positive,” but USC had no official postgame update on Lee’s status. Kiffin could only say that the injury “obviously didn’t look very good.”
RAPID FIRE
 
The game was filled with quick strikes on offense as both teams found success stretching the field. Arizona State racked up 612 yards of offense and USC had 542 of their own.
None of the game’s scoring drives took more than 4:20 off the clock. Arizona State scored in two minutes or less on five occasions, and USC did the same three times.
But four turnovers doomed the Trojans, as they could only force one -— an interception by freshman safety Su’a Cravens — in the third quarter that was too little, too late.
“That’s the story of the game — four turnovers,” Grimble said. “Those killed us. We shot ourselves in the foot.”
Kelly executed the Sun Devils’ no-huddle offense to perfection, completing 23-of-34 passes for 351 yards and three touchdowns. He also rushed for 79 yards and was never sacked by USC’s defense, which came in ranked fourth nationally in sacks.
“That’s something we really gotta look at,” senior defensive end Devon Kennard said, “because they did some quick throws and got the ball out, and we gotta find ways to get [to the quarterback] no matter what.”
Kessler finished 20-of-29 for 295 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions, and was sacked four times.
OPPORTUNITY KNOCKIN’
 
The Trojans had multiple chances to take the lead before halftime, but two stunning turnovers shifted the scoreboard in Arizona State’s favor.
With the game tied at 14 and just under seven minutes remaining in the first half, Kessler delivered a picture-perfect pass to a wide open Lee on a crossing route over the middle. But Lee inexplicably tipped the ball in the air, setting up Arizona State cornerback Osahon Irabor for a momentum-shifting interception.
The Sun Devils took advantage of the miscue with a 28-yard field goal to make the score 17-14, and USC got the ball back with 4:41 remaining before halftime.
Madden then had his number called three times in a row on the ensuing drive, and broke free on the last carry for 12 yards before fumbling at midfield. Arizona State recovered, and ate up the rest of the clock en route to another field goal to give the Sun Devils a 20-14 lead going into the locker room.
Aside from that miscue, the Trojans’ running back tandem of Madden and redshirt freshman Justin Davis performed well once again. Madden rushed for 128 yards and one touchdown on 20 carries, and Davis gained 122 yards and three touchdowns on just 10 attempts.
But overall, as the Trojans head into their bye week winless in the Pac-12, it’s clear that no aspect of the team is without its flaws.

At last, Haden gets the huevos to do what should have been done at the end of last season for humiliating the Trojan football program and depriving Matt Barkley of a shot at the Heisman and the millions of dollars he lost wasting a year quarterbacking for an incompetent.
University football programs are, first and foremost, educational initiatives that should have as their primary goal the enhancement of student learning and development.  The stunning failures under Daddy and Sonny Kiffin would have led to both being fired as teaching faculty.
Kiffin and Miley Cirus . . . what do they have in common?  No talent and the fact that no one should look at them again.
Kiffin is a classless, immature, punk who has no business at a great school like USC.  No I didn’t attend USC and I rarely root for them, but a strong USC is good for football.  USC should have known better by the way he treated UT (Tennessee).  Once a rat, always a rat.  You can’t change a zebra’s stripes.
USC is better than that.  USC is a class act and even though I am a SEC fan, I feel, as I just mentioned that a strong USC is good for the football world.
It will take another 5 years at least to rebound from what he has destroyed at Troy.  It will take Tennessee another 5 years more (a total of 9 years) to rebound from what he did to them.  He destroys everything he touches and I look up to Hayden for having the b@lls to do what he did.
One last thing . . . ROLL TIDE ROLL !

Graduate students gathered in Aresty Auditorium at the USC Health Sciences Campus on Friday morning for Legislative Day, an opportunity to hear from a panel of legislators and pharmacists on a wide range of topics, including the passage of a bill titled SB 493, which aims to boost pharmacists’ status to care providers and expand their scope of practice.
Members of four professional organizations at USC, including the American Pharmacy Student Alliance (APSA) and California Pharmacists Association, coordinated the event. Ying Long, the CPhA Board of Trustees Representative for the APSA at the School of Pharmacy, emphasized the significance of Legislative Day.
“Our purpose is to educate students on the importance of being legislatively active by inviting local assembly representatives and senators in Los Angeles,” Long said. “We also invited pharmacists who are involved in legislation to demonstrate to students what they have done for the profession and give them exposure to legislation.”
One of the seven speakers, State Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), was a co-author of SB 493. The bill, passed on Sept. 11, gives pharmacists the ability to extend their services into primary care through administering drugs and vaccinations. The bill also broadens the settings in which pharmacists can work, rather than being confined to pharmacies and hospitals. The bill is currently awaiting a signature from Gov. Jerry Brown.
“The success of the Affordable Care Act in the country is going to be dependent on what happens here in California,” Hernandez said. “There will be a huge capacity issue, a shortage of primary care providers — that’s where [pharmacists] come in.”
Hernandez also said that the bill will be transformative for the profession by using the intensive training that pharmacists already have to their advantage, granting them more independence.
Many students in attendance were excited for future prospects in their occupation.
“It is great that more positions are becoming available to pharmacists, because after completing a residency and investing so much time in my degree, it would be nice to secure a career,” said Tattika Soreta, a third-year pharmacy student.
Jon Roth, CEO of the CPhA, spoke about the importance of grassroots campaigning within the pharmacy profession and staying involved.
“It is critical to stay engaged throughout the entire process -— you are the experts. There is power in numbers, and when mobilized, these numbers provide a great army of information to legislators,” Roth said. “There needs to be an ongoing dialogue between pharmacy constituents and elected officials, so they get the message about the breadth of a pharmacist’s education and training. Nobody else can talk about what you’ve experienced.”
Victor Law, a member of the California Board of Pharmacy, worked with students to co-sponsor the SB 493 bill.
“I want to encourage students to get in touch with legislators and have an active role by stepping out of their comfort zone,” Law said.
Many pharmacy students who attended were motivated by the event.
“I came to Legislative Day to learn more about SB 493, but I now know that as a student, I need to get involved,” said Timothy Liu, a second-year pharmacy student.
The event culminated with an awards ceremony honoring the Legislative Planning Committee, the group that made the panel possible.

This Saturday marked the first Unity Street Fair organized by USC’s Students Organizing for Literacy, Inclusion and Diversity.
Bridging gaps · The Unity Fair welcomed more than 300 people at a park located at the intersection of Hoover Street and Adams Boulevard on Saturday. – Dasha Kholodenko | Daily Trojan
The event brought together USC students, community members, the Dept. of Public Safety and the Los Angeles Police Department. The event was hosted partly in response to allegations of racial profiling and misconduct after LAPD broke up a party of predominantly black students on May 4 of last year.
The fair welcomed more than 300 people to the park at the Hoover Recreational Center at the intersection of Hoover Street and Adams Boulevard and was part of a summerlong collaboration among law enforcement, SOLID and multiple student organizations including the Black Student Assembly, the Black Social Work Caucus and USChange Movement.
The fair featured a raffle of donated items, a disc jockey and various food options. The park housed different booths set up by organizations including SOLID and the Black Student Assembly. LAPD University Park Task Force also had a booth of uniformed officers who spoke with community members. DPS officers in uniform patrolled the event while others, including Chief John Thomas, came in plain clothes and mingled with guests.
SOLID Executive Director Paul Young, a second-year graduate student in the School of Social Work, said the event coordinators hoped to emphasize a spirit of collaboration between law enforcement and the community that went beyond fighting for the students affected on May 4.
“We wanted to have a different response,” Young said. “Instead of just advocating for that group we wanted to advocate for the neighborhood, for other students of color. We wanted to put together an event where we can show something positive can come out of the situation.”
Selam Kidane, a second-year graduate student at the School of Social Work and member of the Black Social Work Caucus, said there is often a culture of fear surrounding law enforcement, but that dialogue is the key to making lasting changes.
“I’d hope that more candid conversations can take place with the community and LAPD and DPS around some of the things that have happened that have scarred the community,” Kidane said.
LAPD and DPS have been meeting with student organizations and have worked to change party protocol so that DPS officers will be the ones to act as first responders.
Sergeant Jon Pinto of LAPD Southwest Division and the University Park Task Force said the task force, which patrols the area surrounding USC, has also held weekly meetings with DPS to create a unified set of policies to close parties and issue warnings.
“We’ve been working with several organizations at USC to heal some of the concerns that the community has and to show the community and university that we’re working in partnership,” Pinto said.
Makiah Green, a first-year graduate student in the master of professional writing program and student leader of the USChange Movement, said the purpose of the event reached further than just addressing the issue of parties.
“There’s a huge misconception that this is about the party and it’s really not; it’s about the underlying racial biases,” Green said.
Green said it was nice to see law enforcement interacting with the community, particularly children that came to the fair, but she still believes fostering a culture of trust will take time.
“I feel like the officers and community members have been kind of segregated,” Green said. “I don’t necessarily know if the kind of communication we wanted to occur did but this is only the first event and a lot of people aren’t comfortable with the police, so I think as time goes on, we’ll be able to build those relationships.”
SOLID co-founder Jacqueline Jackson, a second-year graduate student in strategic public relations and business fundamentals, said that demonstrating USC could care and provide for the surrounding community was key to the event’s success. Growing up in the Inglewood community not far from USC, Jackson said education was not readily available to her, and she took extensive steps to seek it out. In August of 2012, Jackson and Rikiesha Pierce founded SOLID with the goal of expanding the mile-and-a-half radius that USC serves.
“We wanted to build an organization that reached out into the community and brought educational resources and that also brought opportunities to get closer to campus and meet USC students,” Jackson said.
Community outreach also  became a large part of Saturday’s fair. Jackson estimates the fair cost upward of $5,000, but various donors, including community members, alumni and DPS contributed funds, as well as raffle prizes, including more than 40 backpacks full of school supplies and 30 bikes.
 
“I always remember back-to-school season as a kid, but l don’t ever remember going out to purchase a backpack. I didn’t get books, so for me, it was important to come and provide things that I knew were a necessity for these kids,” Jackson said. “The community should feel as if USC is its home.”
When marketing the event, SOLID reached out on social media and email but wanted to make sure that even people who didn’t have access to technology at the event still felt welcome. Volunteers walked the streets handing fliers out to homeless individuals.
Jackson’s mother Ida Herroan said she has lived in South Los Angeles for many years, but this type of community outreach is in many ways a new phenomenon signaling positive change.
“What I see here is a great improvement on society,” Herroan said. “It gives [people] that boost in life. They can say, ‘I don’t have to stay in one place. I can move around in this universe.’”
For DPS Chief John Thomas, this type of cooperation and community outreach is also a welcome change.
“As someone who’s lived through the 1965 riots in L.A. and the 1992 riots in L.A., I didn’t see too many efforts that at the end of those traumatic and tragic incidents people worked with police and the community to bring about better working relationships,” Thomas said.
Thomas stressed that DPS is accountable to the public and has a responsibility to prevent issues of mistrust.
“I think if nothing else this was a genuine effort on the part of DPS and LAPD to work with the students to build a stronger relationship, and I hope at the end of the day that’s accomplished, and we start working toward the second annual fair.”

USC students competed to use transmedia storytelling strategies to raise environmental awareness in South Los Angeles communities at CRUNCH Hackathon over the weekend.
The 24-hour event was organized by the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s Innovation Lab, and held at WeWork, a co-working office in Hollywood. Co-working offices are spaces where mobile employees can go to work with others who do not work in their companies’ offices.
The hackathon was divided into two parts. For the first part, on Friday afternoon, participants formed teams and came up with transmedia storytelling designs.
For the second part of the event on Saturday morning, participants presented their environmental protection projects and competed to win the final prize. Their projects were judged according to several criteria including the originality and creativity of their proposal, the integration of transmedia storytelling strategies and how much the project would increase awareness of the environmental issue at hand.
The judges for the event were Aaron Koblin, creative director of the Data Arts Team at Google and innovator-in-residence at the Annenberg Innovation Lab; Kamal Sinclair, senior manager of the Sundance Institute’s New Frontier Story Lab; Shauna Nep, social innovation manager at the Goldhirsh Foundation and Erin Reilly, creative director of the Annenberg Innovation Lab.
“It’s a value exercise. It allows you to quickly think about a lot of different things,” Koblin said of the event. “It’s an opportunity to try something you might not otherwise.”
The winning team was made up of four USC students: Alex Zelenty, a senior majoring in film and television production; Sonia Guggenheim, a sophomore majoring in film and television production; Althea Capra, a junior majoring in film and television production and Luna White, a junior majoring in sociology.
The group’s design was a game for children, in which players build their own communities and raise their environmental awareness by planting, watering and fertilizing plants virtually.
“I think the most interesting and challenging part is that you have to incorporate a story across different media and that is the core of the event,” White said.
The first-place prize was a  six-month membership to the WeWork co-working space, three Google Nexus 7 tablets, and priority admission to next spring’s Digital Design and Innovation course.
Other groups’ projects included a “Disaster Strikes L.A.” game, in which only Metro bus riders survived an apocalypse and had to build a new Los Angeles, a “Four Colors of the L.A. River” game that incorporated the viewpoints of Native Americans, and a game in which users played as Johnny Appleseed to remove graffiti and plant trees.
Andrew Schrock, head research assistant of this year’s hackathon, explained the origins of the event.
“The [Annenberg Innovation] Lab is really interested in engaging with the local community, and transmedia storytelling is something that would be helpful to address the environmental problems in South Los Angeles,” Schrock said.
The hackathon also attracted professionals in the media industry. Attendees found the topics of the event applicable to many different fields.
“I am a public policy student, so I will think more creatively about what is the policy planning behind urban development,” said Kim Kweder, a second-year graduate student in public administration.

Athletic Director Pat Haden terminated former coach Lane Kiffin early Sunday morning, and introduced former defensive line coach Ed Orgeron as USC’s interim football coach in a press conference in the team auditorium Sunday afternoon. Haden fired Kiffin in a small room at Los Angeles International Airport after the team returned from a 62-41 embarrassment at the hands of Arizona State.
 
Exit Lane · USC head coach Lane Kiffin was fired early Sunday morning following a heart-wrenching loss to the Arizona State Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz. This was Kiffin’s fourth season with the Trojans. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“I thought this was the right time,” Haden said. “At the end of the day it became a gut feeling that we weren’t making the progress we needed to make.”
Orgeron, 52, is in his 11th season at USC. He served as the Trojans’ defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator from 1998-2004 before leaving to become the head coach at Ole Miss. Orgeron went just 10-25 in three years at Ole Miss before being let go after the 2007 season.
He spent 2008 as the defensive line coach of the NFL’s New Orleans Saints before Kiffin hired him at Tennessee prior to the 2009 season. When Kiffin left Tennessee to return to Troy, Orgeron returned with him, and has served as the defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator since.
“I want to thank Pat Haden, USC President Max Nikias and the Trojan family for trusting me to be the head coach at USC,” Orgeron said. “It’s an unfortunate day today. We are here as a staff to answer the bell.”
Haden and Orgeron, as well as senior defensive lineman Devon Kennard and junior center Marcus Martin, who are both team captains, all thanked Kiffin for his work and dedication to the program, but acknowledged it was time to move forward.
“We’re excited about a new opportunity,” Kennard said. “It’s a new beginning.”
Kiffin went 28-15 in three-plus seasons at USC, including losses in seven of the last 11 games. Cries for Kiffin’s firing started after the disastrous 2012 season, when USC started the season ranked No 1 in the country but finished just 7-6. But Haden said he did not fire Kiffin then because the Trojans had won 10 games in 2011, and Haden believed last season to be an anomaly.
According to Haden, Kiffin was “clearly disappointed” when informed of the decision close to 4 a.m. Sunday morning.
“He’s a great recruiter, he battled me,” Haden said of Kiffin. “He really, really tried to keep his job. And I respect him for that. But at the end of the day, I think it was the right decision.”
Haden and Orgeron talked numerous times about bringing “fun” back to USC football, something the Trojans had seemingly been lacking. Orgeron, known by players and media alike as “Coach O,” is recognized for his strong, raspy voice and fiery sideline personality.
“Ed Orgeron brings an incredible passion and energy that we need on this team,” Haden said.
Neither Haden nor Orgeron would speak to anything beyond the Trojans’ eight remaining games. Orgeron said as a coach it is his job to focus on the current season, and Haden said it would “not be fair to our team” to start talking about the search for a permanent head coach right now.
 
 
Every year is a new deal.  The deal this year is that the Trojans were 3-2 a the time of the firing. I think the firing was premature. All that Trojan history stuff that Haden rationalized was really a bunch of ‘holier than thou’ crap. Every coach deserves a second  year to overcome one not-so-good season.
Wasn’t it Haden who was behind Kiffin 125% at the end of last season. OK, so Interim Coach Orgeron had a dismal 10-25 record in three years at Ole Miss.  Exactly how will this type of coach take the Trojans to the next level?  Kiffin should have been fired at the END of last season so that we could have a real coach by now.  Haden’s head should be on the chopping block next for his mismanagement of the FB coaching situation.
To Bill Baldwin, Jr: I think your post is dead on the money. The manner in which Kiffin’s firing was handled was classless. Haden blew it.
USC Athletic Director Pat Haden has done what I would have said was impossible, made Lane Kiffin a sympathetic figure thanks to the classless and vindictive  manner Haden chose to fire his head football coach. I wanted Kiffin fired last year and he deserved to be let go now, but whether you liked him or not, Kiffin put his time, effort and heart into the job, and deserved to be treated respectfully. Meaning,  if you’re Pat Haden you ask him to meet you at your office later that day and give him the news. You don’t drag the poor guy off the team bus at 3 am, march him into some vacant back office like it’s the Soviet Union and you’re the KGB and then let him plead for his job for 45 minutes,  knowing no matter what Kiffin says, he’s dead meat. 
Lane Kiffin deserved to be fired, but he also deserved the courtesy of riding on the team  bus with the players and coaches back to USC for a final time. Pat Haden was a great quarterback 40  years ago, but a lousy AD today.

Research2.0, an academic research reform initiative from the USC School of Pharmacy, hosted the Science and Tech Forum: Los Angeles to explore the changing landscape of scientific research this past weekend at the USC Davidson Continuing Education Conference Center.
The forum aimed to spur activity and collaboration across Los Angeles in the sciences, and to explore how new tools and technologies help increase the speed and rigor of research. The conference also featured unique “unconference breakout sessions” where attendees set their own agenda, adding to the collaborative opportunities at the event.
“As part of this mission, we started looking around for where is the greatest part of innovation, because the traditional paradigm is incredibly inefficient,” said Research2.0 creator Llewellyn Cox, a program administrator for research at the School of Pharmacy. “As scientists, we should look at the projects we are planning to do and take a more open look at how to best achieve it.”
The Science and Tech Forum: Los Angeles builds on the School of Pharmacy’s Research2.0 initiative, which strives to connect entrepreneurs and startups in the bioscience industry with the academic community to foster innovation by sharing their ideas, research and tools.
Cox said he and his team want to make scientific research more effective and rigorous, but at the same time also close the gap between science and society.
“Scientific leaders who blog and are active on Twitter engage with the community on these major scientific issues,” Cox said.
Martha Pastuszka, a graduate student in molecular pharmacology and toxicology at the School of Pharmacy, was enthusiastic about the forum.
“This forum provides an alternative view to scientific research. [The speakers] have been talking about things that have been fundamental to science but they’re kind of questioning the status quo,” Pastuszka said. “I think the future of scientific research will definitely be more collaborative between disciplines and not just some guy thinking about science and doing it himself.”
Cox noted the difference between working in academia and a startup. In academia, he said people tend to have the desire to perfect their products before launching whereas in a startup, they tend to launch their products as soon as possible for feedback regarding flaws and then fix those flaws.
Many students were excited about the possibility of being involved in moving the science world into the future.
“One of the major problems is the outdated view of what science is, so this forum is dedicated to helping people realize that science needs to adapt to the changing world,” said Zoe Folchman-Wagner, a doctoral student in pharmacology and pharmaceutical sciences.
Cox noted the potential for collaborations among the different disciplines and schools at USC.
“My hope is that [the forum] will bring us closer together, because it is somewhat silent between the different disciplines and schools at USC,” Cox said. “To move research forward, we have to collaborate and we have to work together.”

Folks, I have a full disclaimer: I have never, ever stepped foot in the Lyon Recreation Center with the intention of using a treadmill, elliptical — or any other machine, for that matter. The one time that I did go was to sign the general waiver form during orientation. The closest I have come to calling myself an athletic individual was in the seventh grade when I achieved a purple belt ranking in tae kwon do.
But on the rare occasion that I succumb to the peer pressure of my gym-savvy suitemate who drags me out to lace up a pair of Nikes for a workout, this is the motivational mix that keeps me running like I stole something. This week’s playlist is for the toned, tanned and those trying to get there.

“Bad Girls” – N.A.R.S.
“Live fast, die young. Bad girls do it well.” Do I actually have to write the rest of this description? You know the gist. Start your workout with America’s resident bada–, M.I.A. Sri Lankan-born Mathangi “Maya” Arulpragasam  rose to fame with the single “Paper Planes.” Like most of her songs, “Bad Girls” features a blend of Indian and Middle-Eastern instrumentation. Artists Missy Elliott and Azealia Banks star in this more upbeat remix that will empower you right from the start.
“Slight Work feat. Big Sean” – Wale
Washington D.C. rapper Wale brings this motivational track to the table in his album Ambition. There’s nothing more inspirational than hearing Big Sean bellow “You make 25 a year? I make 25 a night,” as your blood starts pumping and the sweat starts flowing. Don’t stop now.
“POWER” – Kanye West
There’s nothing quite like the angst of Kanye West to fuel your workout at the point where you’re starting to feel worn out. Lauded by music critics as Kanye’s comeback single, “Power” has been featured in plenty of commercials and trailers. If you’ve got some extra time on your hands post-workout, check out the music video. Director Marco Brambilla has captured the legend that is Kanye West in a way you’ve probably never seen it done before.
“Come & Get It” – Jump Smokers
DJ music group Jump Smokers puts an electrifying spin on Selena Gomez’s much slower single, “Come & Get it.” There’s something about this version that will get you off your feet and moving.
“Goin’ In” – Skrillex
As a college student, I’m practically committing social suicide by admitting I’m not the biggest fan of Skrillex. But Skrillex’s renewal of the funky Birdy Nam Nam’s single is just too irresistible. In this version, he’s boosted the levels on the A$AP Rocky’s “Wild for the Night” samples to make it a far more addictive piece.
“Dope” – Tyga, Rick Ross
Tyga has faced intense criticism from intellectuals to rap enthusiasts alike for his misogynistic music. In fact, just this past spring, Harvard University students campaigned to stop him from headlining at their annual Yardfest music festival. As a woman, I sympathize with these sentiments and agree that his sexist messages are inappropriate. But if we are going to criticize Tyga for his taste, we might as well stop listening to hip-hop, rap and R&B in their entirety. So let’s face it, friends: His fiery beats make this potty mouth’s songs perfect for a good dance session or workout.
“Express Yourself” – Gent & Jawns
College partygoers can thank electronic music maven Thomas Pentz, more commonly known as Diplo, for consistently delivering heart-racing hits. His trap selections, such as “Boy Oh Boy” and “Butter’s Theme,” deserve a shout-out of their own because this music has the ability to turn any uncomfortable social scenario into a fist pump-worthy situation. The relatively obscure DJ duo, Gent & Jawns (who humbly describe themselves as just a “couple of dudes makin’ beats”) have remixed Diplo’s most popular number into an impeccable arrangement that just gets better and better as it unfolds.
“Werkin’ Girls” – Angel Haze
Twenty-two-year-old Angel Haze is making waves in the hip-hop scene with her impressive tracks. Comparable to the better-known Azealia Banks, this New York native and her profanity-laden production will give you a much-needed adrenaline boost: “Like I run on sense like a motherf-ckin’ chopper / Like a cheetah in the jungle but I’m motherf-cking faster.” And though her lyric recitation is arguably quite hard to follow, if you play close attention, her crude lyrics are quite entertaining: “Like I’m diarrhea or whatever’s sitting under it / I’m nasty, I’m insane, I’m too much, I spit grains.”

As the writer and performer of four speaking parts in her play Silent Witnesses, Stephanie Satie recounts true stories from child witnesses of the Holocaust and delivers a performance so believable, the audience begins to question how she transforms from one character to the next so swiftly and flawlessly.

Though the play deals with less than uplifting material, Satie crafts the narrative around personal awakenings and closure, rather than feelings of bitterness or hate.
The one-woman play, which is currently being performed at the Whitefire Theatre in Los Angeles and previously debuted in New York, will keep you anything but silent about the talent and craftsmanship at hand. Theatergoers can count on Satie’s performance to dazzle, stimulate and remind audiences about the power of live theater.
The story revolves around four women: Paula, Amelie, Hannah and Dana. They all have one thing in common: They’re all child witnesses of the Holocaust who have kept their stories hidden for decades. When they meet in a group therapy session led by Dana, these women gain the strength to tell their individual stories from each other’s displays of courage.
Attending the sessions together, each woman uncovers a piece of herself that she had previously written off as buried too deep to be retrieved. Together, these four women piece together the fragments of their broken childhoods.
Silent Witnesses keeps itself rooted in the character transformations and constantly works to keep the tone lighter than you might expect from such a weighty story. As a writer, Satie meticulously weaves moments of comic relief within each story to give audiences a breath of fresh air amid the tales of truly horrific experiences. As an actress, she executes those moments beautifully, never lingering on the joke for laughs, but rather keeping them organic to the story and the characters.
The balance of tone in Silent Witnesses must also be credited to director of the play, Anita Khanzadian. Khanzadian is no stranger to survivor stories, and has collaborated with Satie on two other projects. Khanzadian said she felt drawn to this story because she “totally identifies with these characters.”
Khanzadian said she heard stories of the horrors of genocide growing up because her mother was orphaned in the Armenian genocide, the first genocide of the 20th century. Khanzadian’s personal connection to the survivors’ stories undoubtedly contributes to the richness of the play.
Satie also teaches literature and writing at California State University Northridge. She previously received grants from the L.A. Department of Cultural Affairs, the California Council for Humanities and the California Arts Council for her work.
With this knowledge about her backstory in mind, it’s no wonder Satie effortlessly plays four different characters throughout the 75 minutes of the play.
By crafting personal ticks such as the accents and mannerisms of each character, Satie keeps Paula, Amelie, Hannah and Dana separate as four distinct characters. She bounces back and forth from Dana to Hannah, and then interjects as Paula or Amelie as if all four women were in the same room. Though these transitions have the potential to feel jumpy or jarring to the audience, Satie’s seamless transitions are mesmerizing to watch.
A minimalist approach to staging, lighting and sound design brightens the spotlight on Satie’s performance, and by extension, the meaning behind the witnesses’ stories. Designed by Carol Doehring, the lighting punctuates the location by changing from warmer hues to cooler ones, and guides the eye as Satie shifts characters. The play uses few props other than the chairs signifying the different characters.
Sound works as a catalyst for the play, triggering transitions between scenes. At the beginning of the performance, the haunting sounds of bomber planes trigger Dana’s memory of meeting the three women. A song performed by Paula Lebovics, one of the witnesses who gave Satie her witness account, caps off the story.
Silent Witnesses goes to great lengths to deliver a potent story about a difficult subject without a bitter aftertaste. Satie brings together the perfect mix of drama and truth, making Silent Witnesses a personal and hopeful story tied to the Holocaust, but not defined by it.
Silent Witnesses allows the characters to tell their stories and free themselves from the captivity of their secrets. The objective of the play isn’t to point fingers of blame. Rather, it’s the display of courage of these women to tell their stories with brutal honesty to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive.
 
Catch Silent Witnesses on Sundays from Sept. 29 – Oct. 27 at 7:30 p.m. at the Whitefire Theatre, at 13500 Ventura Blvd. in Sherman Oaks, Calif. 91423.

When Justin Timberlake, one of the biggest pop artists of all-time, released The 20/20 Experience, one of the biggest albums of 2013, it nearly went platinum in its first week. How did he follow up on the hype? By putting out part two of that album, of course.
Seeing double · The 20/20 Experience — 2 of 2 incorporates elements of Justin Timberlake’s March release but also includes new sounds, which have a more up-tempo, hip-hop vibe, as exemplified by the single “TKO.” – Courtesy of Justin Timberlake
 
There had been rumors floating around that Timberlake would release a sequel to the album, and he officially confirmed them on his Instagram account on May 5, when he posed in the studio holding a written note that read: “The 20/20 Experience (2 of 2) Sept. 30th.” Since then, fans have been waiting.
The 20/20 Experience was JT’s first studio album since 2006’s Grammy-nominated FutureSex/LoveSounds, and the anticipation surrounding it generated incredible sales: The album sold 968,000 copies during its first week, becoming the number one album on the Billboard 200 and Timberlake’s best-selling first week of his solo music career.
With the success of part one, expectations for part two might have been pushed even higher. Would The 20/20 Experience — 2 of 2 end up being a lesser replica of its predecessor, filled with songs that simply were not good enough to make the first album?
In a word, no.
It is evident that Timberlake wanted to make The 20/20 Experience — 2 of 2 something different from part one but still a part of the complete “experience” by featuring songs recorded during the same sessions as the previous album, as well as songs recorded afterward. The album is heavily influenced by a hip-hop sound and brings a more up-tempo style to many of its songs, unlike the prior album.
The standout single “TKO” is the best example of this and it is also one of the catchiest songs on the album. Timbaland’s production on the song’s beat is full of driving synths and strange clicks and pops, something consistent with what fans have come to expect from his work with Timberlake. JT’s voice delivers a surprisingly hard-hitting chorus of harmonization about how he is “out for the count” because of how his girl has changed.
Keeping with the hip-hop theme, the only featured artists on The 20/20 Experience — 2 of 2 are rappers: Drake and Jay Z.
Drake’s verse on the smooth track “Cabaret” is something special. He raps for nearly an entire minute during his verse, delivering one of his best guest verses to date. In addition to spitting lines such as, “It’s like I’m undercover, [the] way I’m cuffing you though / Presidential sh-t, girl, you up on the poles,” his flow is reminiscent of his older style while fitting in perfectly with Timberlake’s fast-paced melodies.
Though the up-tempo style is more prevalent on the album, it still has its fair share of blues and soul tracks.
One can always expect something unique from the pairing of Timberlake and Timbaland, and the blues track “Drink You Away” certainly fits that description. Full of on-point electric guitar and organs, JT takes on the task of singing out the pain of past relationships, asking, “Don’t they make a medicine for heartbreak?” because alcohol just does not seem to work.
And if you are looking for some old-school soul, JT takes his music back to the ’70s with his lead single, “Take Back The Night.” Horns blast throughout the chorus with various breakdowns, providing one of the best dance songs on the album.
Even though this album fails to deliver a true ballad, the final track titled “Not A Bad Thing” clocks in at 11 minutes and 31 seconds, enough time to feature an entirely separate song with only an acoustic guitar and Timberlake’s vocals for the last 6 minutes of the track. Unofficially named “Pair Of Wings,” the song closes out the album on a happy, loving note.
With The 20/20 Experience — 2 of 2, Justin Timberlake expands on the innovative sound he conceived on part one. His connection with producer Timbaland is just as special, creating new and exciting music that borrows its style from various genres of the musical spectrum. Everything from rock, blues, hip hop and dance finds its way into this musical conglomerate of an album.
The two albums have just enough nuance to differentiate themselves from one another. As the first album featured more slow-paced songs and positivity about finding love, this album delves into some of the tougher parts of falling in and out of love while maintaining that something good can certainly come from it.
For what it lacks in true love songs and happy emotions, The 20/20 Experience — 2 of 2 makes up for it in honest lyricism and vocals full of passion. It is clear that Justin Timberlake has mastered the formula for success, and with that, he has created yet another musical masterpiece.

Over the past couple of weeks, new studies analyzing the implications of e-cigarettes have been popping up. The Economist reported that the tobacco industry is wrestling with this new alternative. E-cigarettes serve as a great option for smokers looking to kick the habit and do less harm to the environment. The Food and Drug Administration should not ban this alternative for smokers. An e-cigarette is a battery-operated nicotine inhaler that contains a rechargeable battery, a cartridge and an LED light that glows to indicate the burn of tobacco. They are, in essence, miniature vaporizers; a heating element boils liquid until it creates a vapor.
Though invented in the 1960s, e-cigarettes really began to spark public interest about a decade ago. The Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association estimates about 4 million Americans currently use e-cigarettes.
Primarily, e-cigarettes have proven just as effective as the nicotine patch, if not more. A study presented at the European Respiratory Society demonstrated that smokers using the patch “[abstained] from smoking in equal proportions after 6 months.” In comparison to the 21 milligrams of nicotine found in the patch, the e-cigarette contains slightly less at 16 milligrams.
Critics argue that the e-cigarette contains a high concentration of nicotine when compared to the average cigarette, which contains about 1.5 milligrams, but the smoker does not smoke the e-cigarette as regularly as the cigarette. Since the e-cigarette mimics the action of smoking a regular cigarette, the device can wean the smoker off consistent smoking more than a nicotine patch could, according to USA Today.
Yes, nicotine dependence is still involved in the process, but as Dr. Chris Bullen says in an article from Medscape Medical News, “At least it is better than having the person continue to smoke.” ProSmoke, an e-cigarette brand, says that smokers need high levels of nicotine to help them quit, otherwise their bodies react to a drastic nicotine level drop.
ABC News states that researchers also found a significantly low number of toxins in e-cigarettes. The FDA reported nine contaminants in e-cigarettes, as opposed to the 1,000 found in traditional cigarettes.
Furthermore, encouraging the use of e-cigarettes as opposed to regular cigarettes prevents innocent bystanders from inhaling dangerous fumes. The vapor from e-cigarettes is not the same as secondhand smoke.
Only a handful of states have excercised limitations on e-cigarette usage, but others are starting to jump on the regulatory bandwagon. The FDA should not ban the sale of e-cigarettes because of their proven benefits, but if the FDA is going to regulate the sale of e-cigarettes at all, there should be an age restriction to prevent minors from abusing the product.
Since the dawn of the e-cigarette craze, minors have picked up the habit as a trend, rather than a cure for cigarette addiction.
Advertisements should not glamorize the product as a fun toy with different flavors. Ads should strictly promote the product as a mechanism to quit smoking, and companies should limit the variety of e-cigarette flavors. The more flavors e-cigarette companies promote, the more likely it is for smoking to become a leisurely way to inhale flavored tobacco.
Reducing e-cigarette regulations would also help promote sales of this alternative to regular tobacco. Restricting sales ultimately harm those looking to end a nasty habit and aid the tobacco industry.
In the end, this innovation could be one of the few things that help smokers break a life-threatening habit.

Many states refused to revise age restrictions for vaping, preferring instead to demonize for sin tax gains.  They then rushed to the FDA to push them into deeming them as tobacco products, pleaded to have them regulated as hard as cigarettes, so they can start collecting their excessive taxes.
Big Pharma is coaching towns how to ban them.  
Cigarette sales have plummeted.  ECigs sales have sky rocketed.  Do the math.
I recently bought some flatware and the forks and knives did not come with any warning that stabbing myself in the eyes with these utensils can cause harm. Why isn’t the govt on that! Don’t they know they must continue to grow in size so they can continue to treat citizens like idiots and save them from themselves by over regulating every single decision we can or may make in our lives? I want to lower the bar on what we consider a reasonably intelligent citizen and have every product on the store shelves to come with millions of dollars worth of studies, warnings and disclaimers.
“Reducing e-cigarette regulations would also help promote sales of this alternative to regular tobacco. Restricting sales ultimately harm those looking to end a nasty habit and aid the tobacco industry.”
I’m not sure that a product that allows you to freebase nicotine is properly called a tool for reducing a tobacco habit. After all, it’s the nicotine that’s addictive in the first place. With nearly no studies done on the health effects of e-cigs and barely any regulation on the Chinese-made cartridges, I’d think twice before advocating for a potentially-dangerous method of drug consumption.
The certainty that ecigarettes shouldn’t be utilized due to a “lack of studies” is alarming.  There are issues to be studied; but to deny another method that smokers can utilize to rid themselves of cigarettes would be foolish.  Life isn’t about the elimination of risk—it’s about the reduction of risk.
The question is whether electronic cigarettes are more safe than their “physical” counterparts: the answer is a very strong ‘yes’.
E-cigarettes have saved my life. I smoked at least two packs of non filter cigarettes everyday for 36 years, from the age of 16 to the age of 52. My health was in decline, and breathing freely was getting harder each day. I tried to quit using various methods including cold turkey, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine inhalers and even hypnotism. Nothing worked until I tried e-cigarettes last October. I have stayed away from regular cigarettes for almost a year now, with no withdrawal symptoms. I no longer have the phlegm and lung congestion that had developed over the years. My smokers cough is gone completely. I can run and exercise without getting out of breath. I can smell a smoker from twenty feet away now, and it stinks. I’m ashamed to have subjected family, friends and strangers to that smell for so many years. I have gone from the highest nicotine level that is available from e-cig manufacturers, to the lowest. My next step is the 0 nicotine content vapor, and then to quit completely. This is my real life study of the health effects of E Cigarettes, and the only one that counts for me. 
Almost one year, and I cannot even entertain the idea of going back to tobacco products. See, that’s the thing. These are not tobacco products. Nicotine is the main addictive ingredient in tobacco, but also occurs naturally in many plants and foods. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is also known as Nicotinic Acid and nicotinamide.
As for the sweet flavored liquids let me say that at the age of 53 I still like candy, cake, ice cream and a host of other flavors that you suggested were only enjoyed by children. These flavors are marketed towards taste buds that we all have, young and old alike. Are Ecigs advertised in teen magazines or alongside Saturday morning cartoons. No, of course not. I personally think that they should not be advertised on TV or in print ads except in the case of adult oriented shows and publications, and I’m not talking about porn either. I think when other smokers see the success of their vaping friends then the product speaks for itself. I think that official age restrictions are a good idea too, but all of the retailers that I know of already have voluntarily put these in place anyway. 
Don’t ruin this for everybody else just because somebody didn’t raise their children correctly. Shifting blame away from oneself is an epidemic in this day and age. The blame goes to the parents for not instilling lasting values in their children, and then to the children who do what they know they shouldn’t do, and then to those unscrupulous enough to buy this product for minors, and then to those unscrupulous enough to sell to minors, and then to marketers who would market to teenagers. Do not blame manufacturers who make flavors that EVERYBODY loves. I’m 53 and I love sweet flavors. Don’t take away what I love because people won’t control their kids.
Make laws prohibiting use of, and sale to minors, and make examples out of those who break those laws, but don’t take it away from adults. Minors apparently need a full time nanny, but adults do not. 
I only buy all of my liquids and cartridges from American manufacturers. I agree with not buying Chinese made liquids or cartridges. I personally do not purchase anything that I know has some Chinese connection. We’ve had lead paint in children’s toys, poisoned drywall, poisoned pet treats, and SARS that have all come out of China, so forgive me if I’m leery of Chinese products.
“…Nearly no studies done”?  Do you know the difference between the nicotine that is in patches, gum and lozenges and the nicotine in e-cigarettes?  Do you have any idea how long all those other nicotine replacement therapies have been studied?  How many millions have to die while the FDA spends another 30 years studying something that has already been studied for 30 years, just so you can be satisfied that it is OK for OTHERS to use a product that you have no interest in using?

Somalia has become an increasingly unstable region in recent years. The international community needs to help bring law and order to help the struggling population of Somalia and cut down on the piracy plaguing world markets. The recent attacks on a Kenyan mall by al-Shabab militants from Somalia illustrate the need for international attention in the region.
Nancy Chiu | Daily Trojan
Somalia, which the Foreign Policy Journal has named the No. 1 failed state every year since 2010, is responsible for the majority of the chaos in the region known as the Horn of Africa. The Muslim extremist group, al-Shabab, has been locked in a war with the government of Somalia for control of the country since 2009, when Ethiopian troops pulled out and left Somalia to fend for itself. At the time, it was obvious that al-Shabab would take over significant portions of the peninsular state without international intervention, according to Foreign Affairs magazine.
In taking over, al-Shabab has brought criminal elements and enterprise to the region that creates chaos in the Horn and in the neighboring Gulf of Aden, which is a major shipping route for international trade.
Al-Shabab maintains huge amounts of influence in Somalia and the Horn of Africa because of its ability to foster economic growth by creating de facto safe havens for illicit activity. The militants allow piracy in the southern and central regions of the country, where government forces have been unable to keep law and order for the past five years, according to BBC. Piracy allows Somalis to earn vast amounts of money by ransoming captured foreigners. al-Shabab supports the pirates by bringing weapons into the area and creating safe harbors for the pirates to land in and use as home bases.
In return, the pirates pay large sums of cash to al-Shabab. The pirate money trickles into the local economy, as harbors that once catered to fishing boats are now boomtowns where pirates spend most of their ill-gotten gains on basic necessities and luxuries supplied by the locals. Local Somalis realize that this economic growth is only possible because the al-Shabab militants control parts of the coastline, and are unwilling to oppose the militants or the pirates because of the economic incentives to do otherwise.
As much as the pirates contribute economically to the region, however, they also bring violence and militant conservative Islam. According to Human Rights Watch, the militants in Somalia enforce Sharia law with harsh penalties for rule breakers. This means that the militants regularly maim or kill Somalis, turning some in the population against the militants. The recent attacks on the mall in Nairobi that left at least 67 dead, according to NPR, are an example of this violence and the way it turns local populations against the militants.
The violence against civilians gives the world a limited opportunity to push out the militants. According to the theories that counterinsurgency expert David Kilcullen lays out in his book, The Accidental Guerilla, this gives the world a chance to intervene and convince the population to turn on the militants. According to Vanda Felbab-Brown in her book, Shooting Up, in conflicts where guerilla groups facilitate black market enterprise but also attack the local population, legitimate government entities can make inroads by stopping the violence while still facilitating some of the illegal economic activity.
By exploiting the ill will against the militants at this time, the world could move into Somalia to push out militants. These efforts would be of limited effectiveness if the world also attempted to clamp down on piracy simultaneously because the pirates are vital to the local economy. Pushing out the pirates immediately would simply give the local community reason to aid al-Shabab in returning to the area because of economic pressure on the impoverished people of Somalia.
Instead, the world would need to undertake a long-term strategy of investment and growth in Somalia  in order to rid the area of militants and eventually pirates. The Brookings Institution notes that long-term economic redevelopment of traditional Somali industries such as fishing would give pirates the ability to return to the industries in which they were originally trained. Somalia has the ability to spur legitimate economic development without pirates, but it would take some investment from the international community.
For international trade and the sake of human rights, the international community should turn its attention to Somalia.

This latest example of Muslim piracy is nothing new…
“In May 1786, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, then serving as American ambassadors to France and Britain respectively, met with Tripoli’s ambassador to London, Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja. During their discussions, they questioned Ambassador Adja as to the source of the unprovoked animus directed at the infant US republic. As Adams and Jefferson later reported to the Continental Congress, the ambassador said the raids were a jihad against infidels. Adja was reported to have said:
“ … that it was founded on the Laws of their Prophet, that it was written in their Koran, that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as Prisoners, and that every Musselman (Muslim) who should be slain in Battle was sure to go to Paradise. ”
To quote the scholar Andrew Bostom, “an aggressive jihad was already being waged against the United States almost 200 years prior to America becoming a dominant international power in the Middle East.”
“Even as movie goers are mesmerized by the portrayal by Tom Hanks and his co-stars of the lives and emotions of mariners held captive by Somali pirates, it would also be helpful to remember for a moment the trials and tribulations of those commercial seafarers who increasing face maritime marauders off the coast of West Africa.
“An important focus can be seen in a recent Piracy Daily / Maritime TV program, where four world-renowned panelists literally ´cover the waterfront,´ and beyond, on key issues involving the uniqueness of the threat by West African pirates; the possible use of lessons learned elsewhere (such as the Gulf of Aden); the institutional challenges still faced in Gulf of Guinea region; and other critical questions and possibilities.
“The story of the emergence of yet another dangerous phenomenon that maritime owners, operators, and crews are all seeking to better understand, even as they guard against being the next victims, can be seen at:

You are all right AND wrong. Somalis are a fierce and smart people. Resourceful but incapable figuring how to reengage as a civilization. No outside solution has ever worked in the past 5000 years. When the men and women ( mothers, daughters, wives) of the individual clans decide to unite within their individual families within their specific clan to secure a safe future they will. The key to unlocking the war and piracy is to restore the clans – one by one.
I’ve got a novel idea. Let’s do nothing. Let the Muslims deal with their own problems for a change. Let’s let countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait with their endless ocean of money and Western-bought armaments figure it out instead. Surely they – being practitioners of the religion of compassion and peace – will step right up to the plate in our stead.
OK, you caught me there. You knew I was kidding! You knew what I know which is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools. Whatever we do will be discredited and if we do nothing Mali will simply become the next Sudan thanks to Islam’s inherent violent and sadistic tendencies.
Dan Morgan-Russell has a reasonable argument, except that it rests upon “the world should.” Of course, the world is not a unified political body and does not behave like one. How about the UN, then?  
The member nations of the UN do not want to support an incursion into Somalia. They have consistently refused to invest money in that savage place or to commit military resources there, either. And best of all, now they see what happens to nations like Kenya and Nigeria who interfere there. Al Shaba’ab gets even. 
So do I have a better answer? Yes. Stay out of it. It is not our affair. We should use US Navy vessels to protect our ships in the area of the Somalian pirates and wait a few centuries until the Somalis are sophisticated enough to establish a government for themselves. Several African nations have and Somalia can follow when they reach a similar stage of cultural development.

This weekend, USC’s trip to the desert started with a blowout loss to Arizona State and snowballed into the firing of head coach Lane Kiffin immediately following the team’s flight back to Los Angeles.
On Saturday night in Tempe, Murphy’s Law reigned over the USC football team – anything that could go wrong, did. Arizona State scored 28 points in the third quarter to lock up a 62-41 win and junior wide receiver Marqise Lee was carted off the field with a left knee injury.
Then, after the team’s flight back to Los Angeles early Sunday morning – after 12 months of whispers, chants and then near-begging from the Trojan faithful – athletic director Pat Haden relieved Kiffin of his duties, according to a release from USC’s athletic department.
The statement sent over e-mail at 4:35 a.m. Sunday morning also said that Haden would hold a press conference on Sunday afternoon at a time and place to be announced.
When Kiffin was asked if he would be bothered by further questions about his job security following the defeat, he responded, “I’m fine with that. I have been dealing with that for 12 months … We have to find a way to coach better and play better and get our backups ready.”
That much is clear following the latest deflating loss suffered by the Trojans – but Kiffin won’t be the man to oversee that rehabilitation.
Entering Saturday night, USC (3-2, 0-2) hadn’t allowed any points in the third quarter this season. The Sun Devils (3-1, 1-1) made quick work of that statistic on their home turf, scoring three touchdowns within the first 5:05 of the second half to turn a game that many were expecting to be a defensive battle into a rout. With that scoring streak, the Sun Devils erased USC’s tenuous one-point lead and severely damaged the Trojans’ odds to win the Pac-12 South.
“It was a tough day for Trojans today,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said. “People were just blowing assignments and doing the wrong things … It was just the perfect storm for us.”
The Sun Devils’ 62 points were just one shy of USC’s school record for points allowed, only falling short of the 63 points Oregon compiled against the Trojans last year.
It was a stunning turnaround after USC only allowed 44 points combined in its first four games.
“I don’t think anyone thought there’d be 100 points scored with these two defenses,” Kiffin said. “Unfortunately we didn’t play good defense today. We gave up a bunch of explosive plays, a bunch of back shoulder throws.”
After redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden raced for a 24-yard touchdown less than a minute after halftime to give USC a 21-20 lead, the Sun Devils punched in 28 unanswered points in the third quarter.
Tailback D.J. Foster hauled in a 74-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Taylor Kelly to give the Sun Devils the lead at 28-21, and redshirt sophomore Cody Kessler threw an interception on  the Trojans’ ensuing drive that was returned 46 yards for a touchdown. After a USC three-and-out, tailback Marion Grice hauled in an 8-yard touchdown reception from Kelly to polish off an insurmountable 48-21 lead going into the final period.
“I think a disastrous third quarter for us was a big part of the game,” Kiffin said. “[Kelly] really threw the ball downfield and made a bunch of plays.”
But the worst news had yet to come – after Lee returned a punt to midfield, the former Heisman candidate stayed down on his back as teammates slowly started to kneel around him in a circle on the field, setting a surreal scene.
Redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble did say after the game that Lee’s injury was examined and that “whatever he got looked at came back positive,” but USC had no official post-game update on Lee’s status. Kiffin could only say that the injury “obviously didn’t look very good.”
RAPID FIRE
The game was filled with quick strikes on offense as both teams found success stretching the field. Arizona State racked up 612 yards of offense and USC had 542 of their own.
None of the game’s scoring drives took more than 4:20 off the clock. Arizona State scored in two minutes or less five times, and USC did the same three times.
But four turnovers doomed the Trojans, as they could only force one – an interception by freshman safety Su’a Cravens in the fourth quarter that was too little, too late.
“That’s the story of the game – four turnovers,” Grimble said. “Those killed us. We shot ourselves in the foot.”
Kelly executed the Sun Devils’ no-huddle offense to perfection, completing 23-of-34 passes for 351 yards and three touchdowns. He also rushed for 79 yards and was never sacked once by USC’s defense that came in ranked fourth nationally in sacks.
“That’s something we really gotta look at,” redshirt senior defensive end Devon Kennard said. “Because they did some quick throws and got the ball out and we gotta find ways to get [to the quarterback] no matter what.”
Kessler finished 20-of-29 for 295 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions, and was sacked four times.
OPPORTUNITY WAS KNOCKING
The Trojans had multiple chances to take the lead before halftime, but two stunning turnovers shifted the scoreboard in Arizona State’s favor.
With the game tied at 14 and just under seven minutes remaining in the first half, Kessler delivered a picture-perfect pass to a wide-open Lee on a crossing route over the middle. But Lee inexplicably tipped the ball in the air, setting up Arizona State cornerback Osahon Irabor for a momentum-shifting interception.
The Sun Devils took advantage of the miscue with a 28-yard field goal to make the score 17-14, and USC got the ball back with 4:41 remaining before halftime.
Madden then had his number called three times in a row on the ensuing drive, and broke free on the last carry for 12 yards before fumbling at midfield. Arizona State recovered, and ate up the rest of the clock en route to another field goal to give the Sun Devils a 20-14 lead going into the locker room.
Aside from that miscue, the Trojans’ running back tandem of Madden and redshirt freshman Justin Davis performed well once again. Madden rushed for 128 yards and one touchdown on 20 carries, and Davis gained 122 carries and three touchdowns on just 10 attempts.
But overall, as the Trojans head into their bye week winless in the Pac-12, it’s clear no aspect of the team is without its flaws.

IF Kiffin had ANY class himself, I would say, “wait until the day light hours to fire him.  But he has no class.  He has no leadership, he has no manners, he has no accountability and now he has no team.  I admit, I am a troll on this page.  I did not go to USC &I do not normally support USC.  However, a strong USC is good for the college football world.  Kiffin proved to be a sly dog when he left Tennessee in the middle of the night.  What did USC fans expect when they got him? An angel?  More like an imp!  He needs to grow up and learn HOW to be a coach instead of a whiner and a complainer.  Hayden did the correct thing by firing him on the spot.  I too wonder what took him so long but better late than never.
I look forward to a stronger and USC Trojan team that the rest of the country can respect on and off the field.
The only thing Kiffin had going for himself was his wife.  She is a class act and hot as hell to boot.  I kinda feel sorry for her because she is married to a spoiled brat who can’t coach and blames everyone else for his failures.
Good riddance!
Chris, I totally agree with you that is how it looks. Perhaps Haden will say something in his press conference that presents a justification exonerates Hayden. If not, it might be time for Hayden to be pulled off a bus.
By far the best choice as USC’s new football coach is Kevin Sumlin.  However, part of what makes Sumlin so superior to many other coaches is that he is a man of honor and he is not going to leave Texas A&M after only 2 seasons.  Nevertheless, USC should get to know him and recruit him aggressively because 5 years from now he might consider a new opportunity.
I think it is classless and ruthless how USC went about firing Lane Kiffin. Firing him immediately coming off the bus like a misbehaved kid being yanked by the arm and punished. No one should be treated this way and publically crucified. Respect a man, give him at least a nights worth of sleep after a loss like that , take him behind closed doors and then terminate him. These “power-house” colleges that aren’t use to losing need to get checked.
It was as classless and ruthless as how Kiffin treated Tennessee.  Hayden did the right thing.  Mexico’s National Team coach was fired at 2:30am after a loss while trying to qualify for the World Cup.  If a National Team coach can be fired at the wee hours of the morning for lack of ability to lead and coach, why shouldn’t a college coach be fired for the same thing?
Hooray…if there was one gift I wanted during the holiday season this was it…Thank you Haden, but I have to ask..WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
