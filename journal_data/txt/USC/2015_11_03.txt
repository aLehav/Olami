The Department of Public Safety hosted their first “Coffee With A Cop” event at Nature’s Brew Cafe on Tuesday. The event provided a platform for conversation between DPS officers and the community, and feeds into the recent DPS initiative for community engagement. Throughout the night, students entering Nature’s Brew shared coffee and tea with 10 DPS officers.
“I think it went amazing, better than expected,” said Elizabeth Carreno, head of community relations for DPS. “We had a lot of people show, but not too many so that we could still interact one on one and that’s the real goal behind this … to get to know more people on a personal level.”
Initially, DPS reached out to Nature’s Brew simply as a host location for the event. The cafe went a step further by providing all participants with a free cup of coffee or iced tea. The collaboration came from a long-standing relationship between Nature’s Brew and DPS.
“We have a really good relationship with the DPS officers, as well as LAPD,” said Alex Kefalos, the manager at Nature’s Brew who sponsored the event. “Most of them come in almost every day. We always offer a discount to our officers and we’re always happy to have them here. When they approached us for the event, it was kind of a no-brainer.”
Though the event was open to the community, it mostly drew student participants. Students taking breaks from studying for midterms discussed everything from campus safety to majors and favorite sports teams with the officers. This type of conversation allowed students to connect in a more casual, familiar atmosphere.
“I liked the setting, I liked that it was more casual and that it made it easier to talk to the officers,” said Kezia Rusli, a junior majoring in occupational therapy. “If they don’t engage with the community, how do they know how to protect them or who the people are? If they’re not connecting with us, they just seem distant, so it was great to see them really making the effort connect with us more.”
At first, conversations stuck strictly to safety-related topics, such as how to use the LiveSafe app and how to pick a safe place to live off-campus. But as students grew more comfortable, they began to open up about their majors — their hopes for the future and their experiences as USC students.
One student joked with DPS Chief John Thomas about the rivalry with UCLA; another discussed learning new languages with officer Erwin Valencia, who is fluent in five. Stretched out at a long wooden table covered in half-empty cups of coffee, the group of students and officers began to build relationships, something that each of the officers had hoped to see.
“I believe we can build some trust, and when there’s trust we can do a better job, and we can keep the streets safer,” Valencia said. “Everything’s about trust.”
In the end, Carreno said that the event was exactly what she was hoping for, providing personal attention to each of the students who took part. She plans to host more “Coffee With A Cop” events in the future in order to continue building relationships and engaging students with their security officers.
“I want the community to get to know us as officers, I want people to be able to see us not just as a uniform but as people,” Carreno said. “And we also want to get to know someone, not just as a student or a community member, but as a person. I think we achieved that tonight.”

Members of the Undergraduate Student Government presented a resolution on college affordability at the Senate meeting Tuesday night. The resolution, drafted by USG President Rini Sampath, Academic Cultural Assembly assistant director Luis Vidalon-Susuki and USG marketing assistant director Paul Samaha, suggested greater transparency in University finances.
The resolution asks for a tuition freeze, an interactive website that outlines a tuition spending report and the reinstatement of the University Student Fee Advisory Committee. This committee would be comprised of two faculty appointed by the Faculty Senate, five undergraduate students and five graduate students appointed by their respective student body presidents.
The resolution presentation began with the results of a college affordability survey conducted a few months ago. The results gathered 1,903 responses over a period of three weeks and showed considerable majorities.
Eighty-four percent of respondents believed that a tuition freeze would alleviate the financial burden for students. Seventy-six percent knew of someone who had transferred from or considered taking a leave of absence from USC due to high tuition costs. Ninety-eight percent did not know the reason for the 2015-2016 $2,000 tuition increase. Ninety-three percent did not know where their tuition dollars went.
The authors of the resolution argued that the University should direct their resources more toward current students than future ones. They pointed out as examples the construction of The Village and the renovation of the Coliseum, two projects budgeted at $650 million and $270 million, respectively.
“This falls into the lack of student voice and how we want to reprioritize funding at our school to go back to the students now, not the students in five years, and not a bid for the 2024 Olympics, which is what this renovation is,” Samaha said. “If they can ask for $270 million to be raised from alumni and donors, you would hope that we could have some priority also on helping alleviate some funds from students who are forced to drop out or transfer out because of tuition costs.”
The authors also mentioned the USC 2014 Financial Report. Samaha talked about the difficulty found in the report, and how Neon Tommy writer James Tyner was the one who presented the data in simple charts.
“You [were] presented with a 72-page PDF, and these graphs are not in the document — these graphs were made by the courtesy of [Tyner],” Samaha said. “In the 72-page report, it is usually just tables and numbers, usually very hard to read.”
Samaha also said that the Budgeted Expenses section was “alarming” because of a possible discrepancy.
“So USC releases their planned budget. However, they don’t actually show what was spent in the end,” Samaha said. “They will give a budget in the financial report, but they won’t follow up and say if the budget was met, what was actually spent. They just show a vague breakdown of expenses.”
Residential Senator Alec White, the resolution’s sponsor, also commented on the report’s apparent vagueness.
“There are ‘current expenses’ but we don’t know what those current expenses are,” White said. “And then ‘other salaries’ but we don’t what these salaries are for, who’s getting them. This is over half of the money, too.”
USC Graduate Student Government Campus Affairs director J. Andrew Clark then spoke about the original student fee advisory committee. Clark said the committee was eventually dissolved because the administration was unhappy with the feedback they were receiving from students.
“We would get these really thick packets, all these budget proposals back from 2013 to 2014 … We would sit down and they would give us all these facts and figures, projections and increases, there were always increases in tuition … but they never really told us why they would increase tuition or where this money was going,” Clark said.
If you think the coliseum renovations are aimed at a bid for the 2024 Olympics, you clearly didn’t look at the mockups. The luxury boxes nikias is throwing into the side of the coliseum are aimed at cramming as many high paying donors into a football game as possible. He might as well take all of the seating out and make football games private, donor-only events. If you think those renovations would somehow make an LA Olympic bid attractive, you’ve clearly never even watched the Olympics on tv.

Students gathered on Tuesday evening in the west lobby of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism to participate in “You Can’t Google the Future,” an event hosted by the Annenberg Innovation Lab.
The event was part of Media Literacy Week, which is being held for the first time in the United States from Nov. 2 to Nov. 6.
“The mission of MLW is to highlight the power of media literacy education and its essential role in that media is in everything we’re learning,” said Erin Reilly, managing director of the Annenberg Innovation Lab.
Reilly said the Lab hosted the event as a partner of MLW, in association with the National Association for Media Literacy Education.
The event was organized by the Lab’s two student workers Haley Madigan and Erin Gorman. In their presentation, Madigan and Gorman focused on 12 media literacy skills: play, simulation, judgment, appropriation, multitasking, distributed cognition, collective intelligence, transmedia navigation, negotiation, visualization, networking and performance.
Gorman is the communications manager at the Lab and is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in digital social media at Annenberg.
“Media literacy plays an important role in our lives. No one in this room is ever without their phone for even an hour at a time. What is important is to realize that while we may be ‘media literate’ now, the ever-evolving technologies mean that we need to evolve alongside them,” Gorman said during the presentation.
Attendees participated in activities such as finding a previously undiscovered feature in an app they use daily and experimenting with Avicii’s new 360-degree interactive video.
“While planning, the event evolved from a panel of teachers to a Twitter party to a Google Hangout, and eventually, it became ‘You Can’t Google the Future,’ an interactive discussion about media literacy,” Gorman said.
Gorman said the lack of precedent was challenging.
“It’s the first year of media literacy week, so we didn’t have past years to look back on. We definitely wanted to make sure that people are aware of the 12 media literacy skills,” Gorman said.
Madigan, a graphic designer and research assistant at the lab, co-organized the event along with Gorman, a junior majoring in media arts and practice.
“I hope the audience walked out of here understanding that they won’t always be the most media literate generation. When generation Z grows up, they’re going to inherit these technological skills. I don’t want to become my grandmother,” she said. “When I approach technology, I want to be comfortable using it, whether I’m 20 or 70.”
Gorman echoed Madigan’s sentiments.
“We wanted to prepare people for a changing workforce, so they feel empowered to keep growing along with the technology,” Gorman said.
Audience members in attendance were impressed by the event. Many participated in the various activities Madigan and Gorman planned out.
Kayla Briët, a sophomore at Fullerton College majoring in computer science, said she enjoyed the experience.
“I love anything that has to do with tech and storytelling, which was discussed here today. I think that in the end it comes down to storytelling and how we interact with the world around us,” she said. “So I really loved this event.”

Diversity in USC curricula, the recent Campus Climate Resolution and the proliferation of cultural appropriation were topics at the forefront of Tuesday’s EdMonth event, “ReclaimED: Why We Need Ethnic Studies.” The event, which consisted of a panel of speakers and was open to students and faculty across campus, was sponsored by the Undergraduate Student Government Program Board as part of a month-long discussion series on relevant topics, from social justice to mental health.
Sophia Li, a member of the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly executive board and the organizer of the event, opened the discussion by presenting examples of cultural appropriation in Halloween costumes, in which students dressed up as Native Americans or painted their faces to imitate black skin color. According to Li, these practices devalue the cultural history and identity of these ethnicities and is one illustration of why ethnic studies is important.
“I feel like cultural appropriation has become a buzz phrase,” Li said. “It boils down to when members of a dominant culture take elements from a culture of people who have been systematically oppressed. When people who have been marginalized or oppressed are reduced to a sentence in a textbook or only one narrative, this lack of cultural awareness is a big part of what leads to cultural appropriation.”
Li defined ethnic studies as “the interdisciplinary study of power, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality and nationality,” and emphasized its importance in redefining the traditional narratives of different ethnicities by looking at history and culture from the perspective of marginalized peoples. According to Li, the discipline grew out of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, but has come under attack in recent years in states such as Arizona, which banned certain aspects of diversity education in public schools in 2010.
Panelist Brianna Thorpe, director of USG Community Affairs, explained that despite establishing a diversity requirement for all incoming freshmen, USC has not done enough to promote ethnic studies among students. According to Thorpe, learning about other cultures is essential for all students, but especially for minorities who have so far learned little about their history.
“It’s important to understand where you’ve been as a people and where you’re going as a people,” Thorpe said. “Without that, you can’t take pride in the things that your specific group has gone through. I think it’s an empowerment tool. It gives us the things that we need to grow and be successful.”
Proposed solutions, including the recent USG Campus Climate Resolution, have attempted to implement greater diversity curriculum, which Thorpe said would help students receive enough information to engage in dialogue and formulate opinions.
“The campus climate resolution calls for more of a holistic approach; what it really wants is an integrated form of ethnic studies,” Thorpe said. “Instead of pigeonholing diversity into one area or one class, it calls for interdisciplinary work to be done.”
Panelists then took turns talking about some of the issues with diversity, discrimination and academics that USC and other universities face, starting with the move away from humanities courses. Viet Thanh Nguyen, an associate professor and interim chair in the Department of American Studies and Ethnicity, explained that over the past decades, enrollment in Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences has decreased, resulting in fewer students being exposed to courses focusing on ethnicity and diversity.
“These courses are useful because they allow you to cultivate a critical and oppositional consciousness,” Nguyen said. “They allow you to connect the dots that people don’t want you to connect.”
Ultimately, Nguyen and the other panelists hoped that students and the University would do more to promote ethnic studies on campus and elsewhere. Moira Turner, the director of USG Diversity Affairs, stressed its practical impact for students of all races, ethnicities and sexual orientations.
“Life is diverse,” Turner said. “We shouldn’t show diverse perspectives as an add-on. We should show them because that’s reflective of what life actually is.”

Due to a donation made to USC’s Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies on Catalina Island, the University has procured its first significant source of renewable energy.
The 88-panel photovoltaic system will generate an estimated 20 to 30 percent of energy needed to power the Wrigley Institute, a research and educational facility for marine and environmental science.
Panels will generate power to support the cafeteria, the dormitory building and an electric vehicle charging station. Under full daylight, this amounts to 23.7 kW of power.
According to Jerome Jontry of USC’s Capital Construction, the system has a mechanism that will send energy produced past the building’s demands back into the Catalina Island power grid. Jontry, who is leading the installation, also said it will include an interactive component to enhance visitors’ engagement with the array.
This donation is the product of an arrangement between the University and Helix Electric. Rob Woolley, who led Dornsife’s efforts on the project, said the partnership is an example of coming together to bring sustainability goals to life. Prompted by a shared vision, Helix Electric donated the solar modules, inverter and racking system, while the Wrigley Institute and the Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences covered installation and other costs.
With this system, the institute can put into practice solutions for the very issues it addresses.
“The addition will allow us to model sustainable technologies to the several thousand researchers, students and guests that visit our campus each year,” said Jessica Dutton, a research associate at the Wrigley Institute, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Catalina Island exemplifies many of the environmental challenges we face everywhere, only in a much more resource-limited setting. Conservation and the smart use of resources such as energy and water is key.”
Installation of the panels also represents the University’s first step in embracing renewable energy.
“I think it’s a symbol that our university is actually willing to understand that it’s a big contributor to climate change and accepting that in can be a leader not in just the education of environmental matters, but also in some of the operations,” said Ethan Bialick, a senior majoring in business administration.
Bialick is the founder of the USC Go Solar campaign, a group that does research and advocacy on solar power with the intent of introducing it on campus. Bialick’s goal is to initiate such an installation on the roof of the Galen Center.
“It’s the biggest rooftop at USC. It would generate a ton of energy,” Bialick said.
In the meantime, installation at the Wrigley Institute has begun, and the system is expected to be operational by January 2016.

Think Then · Junior Gabriella Then and the No. 1 Women of Troy won the inaugural East Lake Cup in Atlanta, Georgia on Tuesday. Then won her semifinal match against Baylor and followed with a win in the finals against Duke. – Photo courtesy of Sports Information
The No. 1 women’s golf team closed out a 4-1 semifinal victory over Baylor at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday and followed it with a 4-1 win over Duke to clinch the first-ever East Lake Cup in Atlanta, Georgia.
The Women of Troy captured their second first-place finish of the year in four fall events.
Senior Kyung Kim won her match Monday night while freshman Robynn Ree, junior Gabriella Then and junior Tiffany Chan clinched wins Tuesday. Junior Karen Chung was the lone Woman of Troy to fall to Baylor.
Chung redeemed her semifinal loss with a win over her Duke opponent in the final match. Kim, Then and Chan won as well, while Ree dropped her match to Duke.
The Women of Troy will not play again until Feb. 7 at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge.
The men’s team defeated LSU 4-1 in the third-place match of the East Lake Cup after falling 4-1 to Illinois in the semifinals.
Freshman Justin Suh, sophomore Sean Crocker, junior Rico Hoey and sophomore Jonah Texeira all tallied wins over LSU to propel the Trojans to a third-place finish in Atlanta.
“Even though we were in the consolation match, it was nice to redeem ourselves with LSU,” Hoey said. “We didn’t show them what we were capable of at nationals, so it was good to play to our potential today and get a win.”
The Trojans will play again on Feb. 4 at the Amer Ari Invitational in Waikoloa, Hawaii.

The incredible work the football players have put in at practice all season long, underneath the surface-level perception of a 5-3 team, has translated into two straight wins and, consequently, an excellent position to win the division.
“The competitiveness has always been there, but we’ve really been executing these past two games and [the] guys have really been playing for each other,” redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler said after practice Tuesday. “All the hard work — everything has always been there. Our biggest saying was just [finishing] games and executing and trying to keep everybody together.“
Linebacker Su’a Cravens said that though the team had started growing impatient with the amount of work they had been doing in practice — which had fallen short with losses in previous games — they were never discouraged. USC has learned that executing the game plan in practice has earned these two wins.
“We were making mistakes that we knew we were better than,” Cravens said. “We know that if we execute everything we work hard on in practice, we would end up being successful. So going into this week, it will be just like the last two weeks — do your job.”
Interim head coach Clay Helton certainly has his team dedicated to playing for each other and for their new head coach. Helton says that he’s been “very humbled” by the way his players have responded to his message of playing as a family, and they have begun playing much more collectively on the field, in practices and games.
“You see guys going out there making plays, and you see guys who maybe aren’t getting the balls as much as they would like to out there blocking,” Helton said.
Kessler echoed Helton’s sentiment of teamwork and hard work in practice.
“It is really cool to see when guys genuinely care about winning games and making plays, just so that their teammate can make it,” Kessler said.
Kessler has faced a lot of adversity in his career and said that playing as a team is the best way to overcome it.
“It shows you, probably the number one thing that I have learned in this entire experience — how important relationships are in this business,” Helton said. “Those relationships between coaches and players are invaluable, and I want them to know that I have the utmost trust in them … I know that I have their trust. And when you have that, you are going to be a very cohesive football team.”
Offensive line coach Bob Connelly said that he is proud of his line players, who have exemplified a “collective unit” more than any other group on the team. Despite injuries to key starters, the Trojan line looked dominant in a second straight performance against Cal where the Trojan running backs accumulated 185 rushing yards, which resulted in 35 minutes of possession time.
“I’m really proud of how our guys have come together,” Connelly said. Obviously, when pieces of the puzzle fall out, there has to be a ‘next guy up’ mentality, and that is what we are preaching right now. We want them to be hostile, mobile and agile.”
This echoes a philosophy Helton has preached all season long, which has inspired USC to play together as a family.
“I really think [Helton] can do great things for this team and this University. I believe in him,” Kessler said. “He’s got my vote 100 percent [to be head coach next year]. That is what we are doing. We are going to play 100 percent for him and hopefully end the season the right way.”
Players have stayed and worked with position coaches after practice to improve their fundamentals all season. Receivers Dominic Davis, De’Quan Hampton and Deontay Burnett joined Kessler and new center Khaliel Rodgers Tuesday, who were already working on snaps, and ran routes that they wanted to improve on.
Tight end De’Quan Hampton and the other less-experienced receivers are trying to develop their chemistry with Kessler as they prepare for more passes in the possible absence of injured JuJu Smith-Schuster, who leads the team with 52 catches for 956 yards and eight TDs.                   6-foot-4 Hampton says that extra passes will help Kessler adjust to a bigger receiver.
Smith-Schuster is listed as questionable in this weekend’s game against Arizona. He arrived at practice Tuesday with his hand wrapped in a sling after surgery on his ring finger, which Helton said went “extremely well.”
“I just wanted stay and get some work in because in some one-on-ones [drills], I didn’t make some over-the-shoulder grabs I should have made, which had been bothering me,” Hampton said.
Hampton has made significant catches in the last two wins and said that his particular attention to detail has resulted in him being more confident to make those plays. He says that his comfort level has definitely improved as he has gotten more and more time on the field. Because he has a firm grip on the playbook and the speed of the college game now, he is able to release off the line quicker and can analyze defenses better.
“It hasn’t really mattered who is out there because the next guy is going to have to come out to work and make their plays,” Kessler said. “They made them last game. It is really comfortable for me knowing that these guys know the offense and, no matter who it is, they are going to come in and make plays.”
Helton says that young wideouts such as freshman Deontay Burnett, who led USC receivers with three catches for 82 yards against Cal, have began to “blossom as players” largely because of a new 45-minute Monday practice, which was implemented the week before the Notre Dame game, that only consists of redshirt players and those who do not get as many reps. Helton said that the extra practice is largely the reason why Kessler has established a large amount of trust in his young receivers, who are continually stepping up and making huge plays for USC.
“We usually use that as a day to be able to lift and for the veterans to get over their bumps and bruises, and watch the tape,” Helton said. “We have taken it upon ourselves saying that we want to develop every kid on the football team. So, they are getting the reps out there and they love it. It’s been really neat to see those young guys start to blossom as players.”

It doesn’t really make sense. Anyone who’s watched an extended amount of college football this season would be able to tell you that USC is a legitimate top 25 team. The talent is undeniable, the potential is sky-high and the chemistry recently has been inspiring. I’d feel confident with USC going into a matchup with anybody in the country right now.
But somehow, USC didn’t make the College Football Playoff committee’s first top 25 ranking. Of course, when I take at look at everyone it did include, I remember why. No team with more than two losses cracked the ranking. The Trojans’ recent surge doesn’t change the fact that they still have three. It’s not the CFP’s vote that doesn’t make sense, but that the team we’ve seen since Clay Helton took over as head coach already has three losses this season heading into the final stretch. The difference between the team since Helton inherited it feels like night and day. It’s so frustrating to think about what could have been with this roster, or the excitement and buzz that could have been going around campus this week if it were the Trojans who were either in striking distance — or already projected — to make the playoff.
Though there’s still plenty to play for this season, and I still hold on to the belief that the Trojans are not mathematically eliminated from playoff contention at this point, the look of the first CFP poll isn’t very encouraging that even a miracle can happen with USC’s season.
Overall, I think the committee did a good job with its first poll. While the AP Poll still has Ohio State at No. 1, holding on a little too much to the preseason hype surrounding the defending national champions, I like the CFP’s decision to go with Clemson at No. 1. The Tigers have a truly marquee win already this year with their victory over Notre Dame. Instead of Baylor at No. 2, the CFP has LSU, who also has a big-name win this year over Florida. Clemson and LSU are the only undefeated Power Five conference teams with that kind of a win already, and I’m confused as to why the AP poll doesn’t recognize that.
It’s still too early to really say anything definitive about the rankings, with the meat of most conference schedules just getting underway this upcoming weekend. The        No. 3 Buckeyes still have to play     No. 7 Michigan State; No. 6 Baylor still has to play No. 8 TCU. But there were some noteworthy question marks from the CFP nonetheless, like a one-loss Alabama team ranking higher than all of those undefeated teams besides Ohio State at No. 4, or Ohio State being the one Power Five team without a big win that would earn a spot if the season ended today.
Most relevant for USC is that the rest of the Pac-12 did not score that highly in the first poll. Not one team from the conference broke the CFP’s top 10, with Stanford coming in at No. 11 and Utah close behind at No. 12. The only other Pac-12 team making the poll is UCLA at No. 23, the last two-loss team to qualify.
It’s not a terrible verdict for the Pac-12. The Cardinal and Utes placed higher than Oklahoma of the Big 12 at      No. 15 and the ACC’s Florida State at No. 16, both of whom also have one loss.
But the CFP might be guilty of an SEC bias. One-loss Florida is just ahead of Stanford and Utah at No. 10, and Alabama is up another six spots from there.
The wildcard is No. 5 Notre Dame, which is neither here nor there for USC. It would be great if either of the two teams in first place in the respective divisions of the Pac-12 had that spot, but it certainly makes Helton’s first loss of the season look even more forgivable on top of the situation he was thrown into.
The million-dollar question is if the winner of the Pac-12 will get a spot in the big dance. As the other Daily Trojan columnists have repeated several times in this space, USC is one loss by Utah away from controlling its destiny to a Pac-12 South division title, and a likely rematch with Stanford for the conference championship.
While Stanford currently trails Notre Dame in the CFP, the committee won’t have to stress about where to put the two by the end of the season. Stanford hosts the Irish for their respective regular season finales. A Cardinal win almost guarantees the four playoff spots will be reserved for Power Five conference winners, and make a win over Stanford in the conference title game look that much better.
But even then, a three-loss conference winner would be really easy to leave out if the rest of the conference winners had no more than two losses. The miracle scenario for ’SC would likely require Clemson losing to Florida State, a      one-loss team emerging from the Coastal half of the ACC — a 7-1 UNC that didn’t crack the CFP’s top 25 but is No. 21 in the AP poll currently leads to Coastal standings — and then upsetting Florida State for the ACC title.
But hey, if the Coastal division of the ACC taught us anything this weekend during the Miami vs. Duke game, it’s that every cliché about the unpredictability of college football is still very true.

Luke, fine article, but look at another side to this: This slight of our team is to our advantage! This snub will make our Trojan team work all the harder to not only win, but to excel! And it is OK if the opposition underestimates us, too.  But this happens all the time. USC is an unusually glamorous team and the sportswriters normally rave about us and rank USC highly early in the season. Then, if it is not a very good season, they are embarrassed, stung and angry to have mis-forecast. To hell with them. Our Trojans will have every opportunity to recover from the weak and distracted performance of the sick, sad former coach Steve Sarkisian. Shine again this weekend, Trojan team!

With the summer heat lasting way past its welcome — and only a few rainy days in between — SoCal’s extended summer has begun to pose a problem. As sea level and peak temperatures have been increasing around the world, ecosystems have been displaced by the environment. And, California is not exception.  According to the California Department of Public Health, the drought has left bodies of stagnant water, which introduce a surprising new problem – waves of non-native mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus. The notion of West Nile virus in the U.S., however, is not at all far-fetched, as Orange County, south of L.A., has incurred 263 of the virus since 2003, according to the Los Angeles Times.  
Though clothing and a strong insect repellant are the first and most effective line of defense against insects, there is an intrinsic component to bug bites. According to the American Mosquito Control Association, mosquitoes bite certain people who have just the right body chemistry.  Take, for example, that you go on a high-potassium diet. The excess potassium that your body does not need is secreted onto your skin, where mosquitoes can detect it. Mosquitoes love potassium, so they are going to bite you instead of your friends, because you are a “mosquito magnet.” The amount of potassium, or any nutrient that ends up on your skin (or if it is even secreted at all) is largely determined by genetics, but it is also controlled by what you eat and how much.  Here are a few tips to separate fact from fiction when it comes to avoiding those awful bug bites.
Facts 
         According to a 2010 study, men who drank three cans of beer were bitten by mosquitos 30 percent more than the control group. Though the biology of the attraction is unknown, significant alcohol content in blood lures mosquitoes in. Fun fact, alcohol does not affect mosquitos like it affects us as they have an innately high alcohol tolerance.
Lemon balm is often sold as a medicinal herb. Lemon balm can be applied to treat cold sores, or ingested to help digestive problems. The balm has “citronellal” which deters mosquitoes.
Myths 
If you Google “insect repellent” one of the first options to pop up, is vitamin B1 tablets also known as thiamine. The Journal of American Mosquito Control Association reported, however, that there was no significant difference between participants that took vitamin B1 supplements and those who took the placebo pills.
I was semi-relieved to find out garlic does not work to repel bugs when ingested. Garlic does have mild deterrent abilities. When you eat garlic, however, there are not enough of its active ingredients to be detectable by mosquitoes. It is only detectable if you rub garlic on your skin — but that’s definitely not a practical solution.
These food remedies can only do so much, so if you find yourself getting bit more than usual consult a doctor for stronger solutions.

Collector and socialite Peggy Guggenheim was one of the most polarizing figures in the art world. The documentary Peggy Guggenheim: Art Addict, out Nov. 6 in Los Angeles, is a comprehensive look at her life.
The film is directed by Lisa Immordino Vreeland, who majored in art history and began her career in fashion. Vreeland’s first documentary, the well-received Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel, was centered on her grandmother-in-law, an esteemed fashion editor. Vreeland’s take on Guggenheim is just as slick and visually pleasing. The film is sprinkled with Pollock-esque backgrounds and peppered with paintings and photographs. There’s a strong sense of style that is consistent in Vreeland’s work.
Vreeland isn’t the only master in her field — Peggy Guggenheim: Art Addict is produced by Stanley Buchthal, who has a wealth of experience in art documentaries, having worked on films about artists such as Robert Mapplethorpe, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Marina Abramovic and Yayoi Kusama. This documentary has already been selected to screen at prestigious festivals such as Tribeca, AFI and Telluride.
When she set out to make the film, Vreeland optioned the Jacqueline Bogard Weld’s book, Peggy: The Wayward Guggenheim, the only authorized biography of Guggenheim. Unfortunately, Weld had lost two summers worth of interview tapes with Guggenheim, but Vreeland unearthed them in Weld’s apartment by an unexpected stroke of luck. Thus it is Peggy Guggenheim’s voice that brackets the film, giving her own voice to her documentary rather than just having others pick her life apart. Vreeland does make the observation that Guggenheim’s voice often comes tonelessly because it was difficult for her to answer many of the questions.
Vreeland also assembled a variety of key experts, such as John Richardson, the definitive Picasso biographer, to act as a prominent speaker in the film. In addition to Richardson, Vreeland also spoke to contemporary figures on the art scene, including Marina Abramovic, an acclaimed Serbian performance artist, Jeffrey Deitch, an American art dealer and curator, and Larry Gagosian, an American art dealer who owns the Gagosian Gallery chain of art galleries.
The Guggenheims made their fortune in mining, but Peggy Guggenheim’s personal life was mired in tragedy. After her father died in the Titanic’s sinking and her sister passed away, Guggenheim’s view on life was irrevocably changed. Her attachment to the tragedy and outsider status of art allowed her to be so cutting-edge in her taste. Though originally Renaissance art piqued her interest at a young age, the artists that she would support and make famous, most notably Jackson Pollock and William Congdon, were outsiders. The documentary made it apparent that she was also an outsider in the luxurious world in which she was raised. Throughout World War II, Guggenheim traveled through many countries alone collecting art, identifying with creators who felt they did not conform.
In New York, Guggenheim shattered the conventions of exhibition space by abandoning the sterile blank boxes. There were multi-use chairs designed by Frederick Kiesler. She also made the gallery out of her personal space, opening her home in Venice to share her collection. Richardson uses the word “pollinator” to describe Guggenheim because being in a community of artists invigorated her to inspire other people.
Another frequently discussed topic in the film is Guggenheim’s private life, as it connects to her work. She was someone for whom “sex and art … went hand in hand,” apparent in her choice of partners — Samuel Beckett, Yves Tanguy, Marcel Duchamp and her eventual spouse, Max Ernst.
However, one shouldn’t define Guggenheim by the men she made famous, though the film postulates that the art world is still dominated by men. With this documentary, one can hope that it might spark the interest of young people, particularly women. Guggenheim stepped outside her comfort zone and the confines of her family to stand her own ground. Her fearlessness is what comes across in the film.

A beautiful, wide and open warehouse in the middle of the Arts District, Trojan CrossFit, has prime realty, and they certainly know it. In fact, my class wasn’t the first time I had encountered the gym. I first came across Trojan CrossFit a couple of months ago while having brunch with some friends at Urth Caffé next door. Though I was intrigued by people running past the cafe and hauling medicine balls, as well as one Scott Eastwood look-alike, in particular, I didn’t put the two together until my recent class.
Upon entering the building, I’m not sure if I was more intimidated by the equipment or all the muscles I saw. Though I knew that CrossFit produced a certain type of body — and by certain type of body, I mean ripped — some part of me was still shocked. Looking around at all the weights, rowing machines, ropes, bars and boxes, I wasn’t sure I’d be able to keep up but was determined to try my best. After all, most of these jacked-up people in the gym must have started somewhere.
With that, I began my first class. Though the gym offers several different variations of CrossFit classes, I took the WarriorFit class, which is meant for more of a beginner crowd. My instructor Lauren, also a USC alumna, certainly tried her best to accommodate my lack of knowledge as well as my lack of muscle. The interesting thing about CrossFit, as Lauren informed me, is that you never repeat the same workout twice. The day’s workout is written in chalk on the blackboard wall and varies day to day. Though some of the exercises remain the same, you’ll never be doing the same workout in the same order.
With Lauren’s explanation, we began the class with warm-ups. Lauren split the class into three groups to start — three sets of a 100 meter row, seven inch worms and seven jump squats. Though I count jump squats as one of the worst exercises in the history of exercises, the warm-up surprisingly wasn’t that bad. I blew through the warm-up with ease, gaining confidence in my ability to keep up with CrossFit.
Once we completed the warm-up, Lauren had the class stretch out, starting with some lunges on the grass. These lunges, however, weren’t regular lunges; we had to contort our bodies like acrobats, stretching our forearms to the grass with each lunge. As we continued to stretch before the real workout began, I looked around the room at all these buff CrossFitters, thinking for sure what I lacked in strength and muscle mass, I’d no doubt make up for in flexibility. I was wrong. To my left, one of the biggest, buffest guys in the class folded himself over like a pretzel while I struggled to reach past my ankles.
With that, we began the real workout — a combination of five different exercises to be repeated seven times: one 100 meter run from the gym to the corner past Urth Caffé, five wall walks, 10 box jumps, 15 toes-to-bars and 20 ball slams. Since the class was so big, Lauren split us up into two groups — assigning one group to do the workout in order and the other to do it backwards. Lauren demonstrated the routine carefully, and with each demonstration I knew completing the workout would definitely be a challenge — the writing was literally and figuratively on the wall.
Besides my poor form, which Lauren was quick to correct, I found the ball slams both the easiest and most satisfying part of the workout. Lauren was right — this was the place to release the day’s aggression. The workout got harder as I transitioned from toes to bar, no doubt a consequence of not actually being able to reach the bar with my toes. Lauren quickly came around to guide me through the bars with some pointers: The wider I held my hands on the bar, the less space I would need to go to tuck my legs into my stomach. The box jumps were next, made easier by my step stool, followed by the wall walks, which surprisingly weren’t as bad as they seemed. Positioned in a pushup position with my feet touching the wall, I used what little strength I still had after the bar to take steps up the wall, slowly walking my hands toward my feet. Two and a half feet is about as close as I got to the wall, but considering the intensity of the workout, it was A-OK in my book. Anyone who knows me knows I hate running, but the 100 meter run was a like a gift from God. I don’t want to admit I was hiding, but I definitely used this time outside of the gym to regroup before going in for another set, trying my best to avoid the temptations of Urth Caffé.
After six sets, hearing the bell ring was music to my ears. We concluded the class with some ab work, alternating between slow bicycles and rocking our bodies back and forth. Core exercises are definitely my favorite part of any workout; I find them fun and they also usually signal the end of class. By the end of class I was absolutely exhausted — I definitely had trouble keeping up with this combination of strength and endurance but enjoyed the challenge.
Though the drop-in classes are only available for experienced CrossFit students, the gym offers a variety of packages for those looking to join the Trojan CrossFit family. For those without experience but still looking for a high intensity workout like the one I took, the gym offers $129 per month for unlimited WarriorFit classes. Trojan CrossFit also offers a student discount for $150 per month for unlimited standard CrossFit workouts, in addition to several other class programs and packages.

Highly acclaimed actress Hailee Steinfeld is now ready to take on the music industry. Steinfeld is already well-known for her Academy Award-nominated performance in the 2010 film True Grit, as well as her roles in Romeo and Juliet and Ender’s Game. Earlier this year, she gave audiences a glimpse of her musical ability with this summer’s Pitch Perfect 2, receiving praise from fans and critics for her version of singer Jessie J’s “Flashlight.” To top it off, Steinfeld also appeared in triplet form in Taylor Swift’s infamous “Bad Blood” music video. Needless to say, Steinfeld is no stranger to the music world.
With a breadth of talent at her fingertips, Steinfeld was quickly signed by Republic Records so she could create her debut album. Earlier this week, Steinfeld revealed the cover art for her EP, HAIZ. The album features four songs, including “Love Myself,” “You’re Such A,” “Rock Bottom” and “Hell No’s and Headphones.”
“Love Myself” is similar in sound and message to Rachel Patton’s “Fight Song,” but doesn’t really carry the same power and popularity that Patton’s song does. However, the track is, without a doubt, the standout song from the EP, as its music video has received around 32 million views on YouTube and can be often heard on the radio. The video doesn’t really have a set plot, but it is simple and fun, showing Steinfeld dancing around Los Angeles. The song is about female empowerment and making sure to take care of oneself: “I’m gonna put my body first / And love me so hard ‘till it hurts” — Steinfeld belts out. Another inspiring lyric is “I’m gonna touch the pain away / I know how to scream my own name.” Steinfeld has proven that when the negativity seems to be too rough, she will brush it off and remind the world that she isn’t going anywhere. The chorus shouts “I love me” throughout the verse breaks.
Steinfeld has a deep voice, but the pitch alternates throughout the song. At some points, her vocals are stand out and the instrumentals resemble a ballad, but then the song quickly switches into dance music and Steinfeld’s voice becomes very high. With this, Steinfeld demonstrates incredible range for her first foray into the tough music industry. A solid and inspiring debut, Steinfeld’s “Love Myself” allows her to create a name for herself with this song alone.
According to the press release, the rest of HAIZ promises to deliver catchy anthems. “Hell No’s and Headphones” features irresistible chants while “Rock Bottom” showcases more of her vocal range found in “Love Myself.” “You’re Such A” is clever nod to a wide range of music genres.
Steinfeld is off to a great start with this single, and the addictive beat will keep her song on the radio for sure. Hopefully, the other three tracks on her EP will be able to live up to the fantastic introduction that “Love Myself” has presented.
HAIZ will be released Nov. 13.

Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
Last week, USC hired James Staten, chief financial officer of the Yale New Haven Health System, as its new chief financial officer. His position, which replaces that of previous officer Robert Abeles, oversees budgetary planning and finances for the Keck School of Medicine, the University comptroller and information technology services.
Staten’s experience with business management is definitely impressive, but the University presents unique challenges in responsible investing. The University’s budget — around $4.2 billion with $4.7 billion in its endowment — presents huge opportunities to fund services ranging from world-class academic programs to comprehensive financial aid. As the University grows in reputation as a top-ranked research university, students and University workers alike have consistently challenged its stance on socially responsible growth. In June, the removal of the University’s employees’ $30 per month reduced-price transit passes caused public media blowback and made employees’ daily lives more difficult. The proposed re-development of the University Village raised further concerns over gentrification in the local community. The recent rally by subcontracted USC janitors protesting contractor Aramark’s lack of raises and unfair work conditions have made issues with employment plain. A litany of protests by non-tenured faculty demanding higher wages and a right to unionize further question USC’s growth. As new administrators like Provost Michael Quick and Staten determine the course of the University, responses to worker rights have consistently denied more negotiating power to those who serve the foundation of our University. As Staten becomes a new voice which profoundly influences University financial decisions, he should focus on expanding services for University workers and listening to student voices on socially responsible investments.
The lackluster response by University officials to University workers is concerning for the school’s narrative of a new era of academic growth, especially in the midst of an ambitious $6 billion fundraising campaign for the University’s philanthropy and expansion communities. With a whopping staff of 450 working on the fundraising team, this new round will be the largest effort to raise money in the history of American higher education.
Academically comparable universities such as Northwestern and Columbia already have established offices on social investment, and Northwestern is actively listening to student voices on the direction of University endowments and budgets. Divestment movements across the country have encouraged Universities to disconnect their funding from sources that students disagree with.
In addition, student and worker voices should take a stronger position on University financial decisions. The recent introduction to the Undergraduate Student Government Senate of a comprehensive resolution that would provide a litany of resources for services to students of color already highlights a growth in student dialogue over where money flows. Protests by University staff ranging from higher-ed professors to janitors highlight a need for better engagement among students, administrators and University staff. The University occupies a unique role as both an employer and a contractor and stands to make better lives for those who keep the University running.
Our University consistently characterizes itself as a world-class research institution in terms of academic prestige and community outreach. It’s an exciting time to be a Trojan, both as a witness to the University’s educational growth in and outside of the classroom. Staten’s appointment lends further credence to  USC’s attempt to bring talent into the inner workings of the University. As we enter this growth, however, it’s integral to remember those who keep the school alive and invest in the labor that makes our education possible.

The journalistic pieces that decry the slow death of free speech at the hands of liberal universities show a peculiar trend of employing liberal rhetoric to do so. A recent piece for The Atlantic invokes the authority of various respected feminists and feminist organizations to illustrate how federal sexual harassment policies impede academic freedoms. This article comes from the same author as the one I addressed in the last installation of this column, who referred to UCLA students protesting the Kanye Western party as “[squandering] their inheritance.”
By pandering to liberal-democratic sensibilities such as freedom of speech and feminism, pieces like this imply that millennials need to be protected from themselves, that what they often want is no good for them but this hypocrisy is unbeknownst to them. However, this rhetoric is merely appropriated for the purposes of what Lindy West describes as a “flippant and condescending” agenda. The broader aim of this agenda is merely to bolster fears of the “progressive bogeyman du jour, political correctness, and all its sinister attendants: microaggressions, the supposed erosion of free speech and the “‘right not to be offended.’”
Rather than making a careful and critical examination of problematic policy, the article cheaply antagonizes student populations.
Targeting federal policies set forth by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is a well-founded position. The over-reaching nature of the policies is covered eloquently by Harvard Law professor Janet Halley in a guest piece for Boston’s NPR news website. Halley’s piece is in fact quoted at length in Conor Friedersdorf’s Atlantic article.
Such a position is also taken by Nadine Strossen in a speech given at Harvard University, which is the basis of The Atlantic article. Quotes from this address constitute at least 50 percent of the article. Friedersdorf also draws strongly upon Strossen’s authority as a feminist and a professional. The subtitle to the article defines Strossen as “A prominent, feminist professor of law” and the first paragraph refers to her as “one of the most accomplished legal professionals of her generation.” The second paragraph details the highlights of her CV: editor of the Harvard Law Review, first female leader of the American Civil Liberties Union, a “staunch feminist” and a guest star in the Broadway production of The Vagina Monologues.
The excerpts quoted from Strossen’s speech center around the federal policies, the pressure they put on universities via funding channels and their legal implications. The article gets dicey when Friedersdorf asserts that she “lamented that whereas students once fought for freedom as government officials sought to stifle it, today students are demanding that the university keep them “safe” from disturbing ideas.” Unlike the other premises, this is paraphrased and not directly quoted. Here, agency and fault is transferred from policy to university students themselves.
Whether or not this transfer of agency is made in Strossen’s actual speech, the resemblance to other pieces run by Friedersdorf and The Atlantic at large is remarkable. It fits conveniently well into the recurring narrative I can’t seem to escape in my research for this column. Again, this narrative hinges upon the agency of a liberal millennial student archetype in the bringing of their own doom.
Such a discussion derails focus from legitimate policy criticisms and aligns itself with an unproductive yet increasingly popular debate about generational culture. As Lindy West points out, the whole “coddled co-eds” campaign actually comes from a place “symptomatic of our culture’s deep investment in minimising and normalizing sexual assault.” The invocation of feminist authority here serves a superficial purpose. Strossen and Halley — and, through their authority, feminists as a whole — become mouthpieces contributing to a narrow discourse in which they never actually enrolled.
Ultimately, it is illogical to use the motifs of the coddled millennials narrative to place the brunt of blame for inadequate policy onto college students who did not write it.
Kristen Woodruff is a senior majoring in classics. Her column, “Old School, New Tricks,” runs  every other Wednesday.
Janet Halley rightly decries Harvard’s new standards as heavily stacked against the accused. What she leaves out is how the secretive nature of the process allows Harvard to ride roughshod over victims, even in cases of victimhood so obvious, they are being ridiculous. Yet, the secrecy inherent in the policy allows Harvard to claim “we have a well of knowledge that no one else has, we know this person in question is not a victim, no we are not releasing any memos, documents, or evidence that backs up our position. We are right. This individual is not a victim. We are not going to budge on this matter.” 
At issue is, who cares if the rules are stacked against the accused, if the system is also set up so they only need to follow their own rules when they feel like it. By failing to point out this issue, Halley and other HLS professors create a scenario where, if a victim comes forward and says Harvard dismissed them unfairly EVEN UNDER THIS STRINGENTLY PRO VICTIM POLICY, everyone will assume, they must have had a really frivolous case if it didn’t even pass muster under those new rules. 
Pretty misleading.

Ask any student, alum or aspiring matriculant what USC’s nickname is and the answer will come easy: the Trojans.
But for the female athletes on campus, the answer isn’t so simple. Though they can be referred to as the Trojans, female teams are often instead known as the “Women of Troy” — including this publication, in fact. This distinction is unfair to the athletes, who shouldn’t be considered anything less than Trojans.
The moniker is one that’s been around since women’s varsity sports teams began at USC in the second half of the twentieth century. The male counterpart, the “Men of Troy,” could likely be traced back much further as USC’s football team dates back to the 19th century. But, “Men of Troy” is rarely heard today.
This isn’t simply because it’s gone out of fashion. The Athletics Department does not promote the name in the same way it does “Women of Troy.” In the media style guides for men’s teams, the nickname is solely “Trojans,” while both are listed for the women’s teams.
This practice of having different nicknames for male and female teams is quite common in college athletics. In fact, compared to nicknames like the University of Central Arkansas’s male “Bears” and female “Sugar Bears,”  “Women of Troy” is quite tasteful.
The problem is that we as a school are not the USC Women of Troy. We are the Trojans, a name that male and female students, and alumni, proudly bear. By frequently calling our female athletes by a different name while not doing so for our men diminishes their status as equal student-athlete representatives of USC
At the Daily Trojan we are a culprit of this ourselves. For this reason, we have altered our style guide to refer to female teams primarily as the Trojans, and occasionally as the Women of Troy for stylistic variance. The men will also sometimes be referred to as the “Men of Troy” for the same reason.
We encourage other media outlets and Athletics’s own publications to follow suit. The Women of Troy have a long and storied history, something to be honored rather than eliminated, but it is also important that we don’t treat our women any differently than our men.
This isn’t limited to just team nicknames. USC’s fight song, “Fight On,” has excluded female athletes with its lyrics: “Fight On for ol’ ‘SC / Our men Fight On to victory.” Though this is likely because the song dates back to before women played varsity sports at USC, new times call for new wording.
Other schools that have tried to make similar changes to fight songs have been blocked by cries for maintaining tradition. Yes, “Fight On” was composed in 1922 and is in fact historical. However, as a song sung at just about every sporting event and spirit rally at USC, it cannot simply be maintained as a relic of the past. It is an active piece of school tradition and, as such, must be updated to reflect the times. In 1922, there were no women’s varsity teams at USC. But, in 2015, there are.

Recently, Greek yogurt has been all the craze as a healthier alternative to frozen yogurt. A lot of people have switched over from Pinkberry to Go Greek, a yogurt shop that sells authentic homemade Greek yogurt.
Go Greek sells classic Greek yogurt as well as frozen Greek yogurt in a variety of interesting flavors such as honey, pomegranate, chocolate and plain tart. They also boast a diverse assortment of healthy condiments like chia seeds, hemp granola, Greek biscuits, unsweetened coconut, rose jam, pine thyme honey and more. Their yogurt, however, often racks up quite a high cost with a small yogurt cup costing around $7 to $8 or more, depending on how many toppings there are.
Being healthy, however, does not have to come at such a high cost! Read on to see my very simple recipe on making your own healthy Greek yogurt bowl to eat at home or on-the-go.
What you’ll need:
Try some free jam samples and pick the one you like! The Farmers Market also has a vendor called Sola Jams that sells homemade jams made with real fruit. They also have really interesting flavors like Cheeky Jalapeno Kiwi. However, I usually buy the Rose Jam from Go Greek Yogurt. The Rose Jam is my ultimate favorite and although it’s a little pricey, it’s definitely worth it! The Rose Jam has a sweet, floral taste that pairs very well with Greek yogurt.
Greek yogurt is said to provide multiple health benefits such as aiding digestion, keeping a healthy metabolism, fat reduction, bone health as well as regulate muscle function. Furthermore, it is lower in sugar and carbohydrates (goodbye freshman fifteen!) and has lower lactose than regular yogurt, which makes it easier to digest for those who are lactose intolerant. So, go ahead and try your hand at making a healthy Greek yogurt bowl (no more excuses for cheap healthy eating!) and don’t be afraid to experiment!

Tracks for when it finally starts to feel like fall (now)! 
Normally, I love the heat. It’s the reason why I came to California in the first place. But this last heat wave was just too much, and I found myself actually missing cool mornings, brisk nights, sweaters and warm drinks. The current break of cool weather is so refreshing. I want all the fall feels. 
Hopefully, this playlist actually inspires the weather to turn for good. It showcases a collection of new and old tunes that will make you want to curl up in your bed with a cup of tea and a movie. So cheers to sweater weather and post-midterms relaxation.
