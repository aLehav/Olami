When Viterbi School of Engineering professor Inna Abramova landed her first job as a chief engineer in the early ’90s, she said she was often mistaken as a secretary in the office.
“The [superintendent] looked at me, and [he] said, ‘What is the company sending the secretary for? They were supposed to send the chief engineer,’” Abramova recalled. “I looked at him and said, I am the chief engineer, and you have to work with me.”
Since then, Abramova said she witnessed major changes in female inclusion in STEM. The most recent milestone: Viterbi reaches gender parity with its class of 2023. 
In a tweet, Viterbi announced 50% of its incoming freshman class were women — a 6% increase from 2017, when Viterbi was already well above the national average for women in engineering schools. According to the American Society for Engineering Education, the national average is currently 21.3%.
Paul Ledesma, director for Viterbi undergraduate admission, said the school’s recruiting process for several years has pushed for more women and minority groups to study and work in male-dominated fields. 
“This has been a goal for a very long time,” he said. “With each year, we have seen more applications in part of the recruiting process … We have a fantastic current student body of women who have done amazing things. Each year, these women help to create an environment that more women want to be a part of.”
Rachel Glait, a senior studying mechanical engineering, said her Viterbi classes already seemed diverse, noting that she sometimes felt as if there were more women than men.
“It just depends on the class,” Glait said. “I’m thankful how other women are in STEM classes … It’s nice having girls around … to collaborate with for engineering projects.”
Ledesma said Viterbi is proud that the Class of 2023 is more representative as a whole. He hopes that having gender parity at the school will encourage more women to enter STEM. 
“The fact that we can be [the first engineering school] to have a complete incoming class at that level, that’s exciting,” Ledesma said. “We are helping to lead the charge, but this is part of the growing trend across the country that more young girls are getting interested in math and science, are being encouraged in math and science and that is starting to impact the applicant pool.”
Viterbi professor Julie Albright said having a diverse class in engineering schools will lead to better inclusion of people of varied backgrounds in the workforce.
“When you have more diverse engineers, students from different ranges of experience … you end up with stronger and more applicable engineering solutions,” Albright said. “Research also shows that companies that have more women in leadership roles … make more money and are more successful, so diversity … is good in the bottom line.” 
While she’s proud of the steps Viterbi has taken to encourage more women to study and work in STEM, Glait said there is still more that can be done to encourage women and other minority groups to enter the field. 
“These are great accomplishments but the fight’s not over yet,” Glait said. “In my experience working in the industry, there’s still a large gap in the ratio of men in the STEM industries, engineering specifically.”

A new study from the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that Latinos are heavily misrepresented in mainstream media, despite growing narratives advocating for increased diversity and inclusion in the film industry. 
The report, titled “Latinos in Film: Erasure On Screen and Behind the Camera Across 1,200 Popular Movies,” revealed no changes in the depiction of Latinos on screen over 11 years. From 2007 to 2018, only 3% of 1,200 examined films featured a lead Latino character. Only 4.5% of speaking characters were Latino, despite the fact that the United States is home to a population that is 18% Latino, according to the study.
The report was conducted by Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Stacy Smith in partnership with the National Association of Latino Independent Producers and Wise Entertainment, and it focuses on the presence of Latinos in front of and behind the camera. 
“This glaring lack of representation does nothing to counter hate-filled messages toward Latinos,” Smith and actress Eva Longoria wrote in a letter published in TIME. “Instead, it tacitly reinforces the dangerous and anti-American views espoused by political figures and some news outlets.”
The report also found that the majority of the Latino characters represented on-screen succumbed to “harmful” Latino stereotypes. In fact, more than 60% of Latino characters were depicted as criminals, gang members and drug dealers. 
More than a quarter of top Latino actors were presented as law breakers and criminals. Only 4% of the jobs held by Latino characters were high-level occupations, while 54% of the characters held a job that did not require a college degree.
The study revealed high levels of erasure within film. More than 60% of Latinos were depicted without ties to their community.
“The results also show that the depiction of Latino characters in these films — as criminals, in poverty or without any links to a rich Latino heritage or community — dramatically extends the scope of the problem,” Smith and Longoria wrote. “We know from research that dehumanization on screen can increase the risk of aggression, in this case, toward Latinos in the U.S. and abroad.”
Across the films analyzed in the study, only 10 included Latino characters over 45 years old. The two roles played by Latinas were both done by actress Jennifer Lopez.
“The Latino community has not been prioritized, and it is imperative that we shed light on the glaring reality of Latino representation in film,” NALIP Executive Director Benjamin Lopez told Annenberg News. “NALIP has positioned itself to be the elegant solution to this complex problem through our commitment to building the pipeline of Latino talent and sustainable development in the industry. Professor Smith’s research must guide decision-makers to the conclusion that there is immense value in collaborating with and investing in the Latino community.”
The report proposed multiple solutions to combat the lack of Latino representation in film. It recommended increasing the number of Latinos behind the scenes, including directors and filmmakers, to expand connections with the Latino community and ensure representation in both small and large roles. According to the report, only 4% of the 1,335 directors were Latino.

A  shooting in Downtown Los Angeles last Thursday and an officer-involved shooting on Skid Row has the concern for safety at USC at the front of many people’s minds. 
Once again, it’s easy to see why the areas around USC are labeled “sketchy,” especially by those who pass down memories of the Watts Rebellion of the 1960s and the ’92 riots that surrounded the campus. These memories persist due to narrative held in place by the continual news coverage of crime in the University Park neighborhood. However, these fears are based on outdated information and racially charged viewpoints. Thus, the University should seek to educate its students about the true nature of South Los Angeles and encourage its students to interact with community members.
Students’ perceptions of the “dangerous” area around campus often stem from parents’ views. Many, especially those who live in and around Los Angeles, remember the race riots of 1992. Violent events did occur  around campus, but a Los Angeles Times article from that year recounts that “the University of Southern California suffered nothing worse physically than one broken window at a parking kiosk.”
While the riots had little effect on admissions for the following year, the same article reports the University’s national image may have been damaged because “some national news shows broadcast incorrect reports of damage at USC.” Still, a student interviewed by the L.A. Times in 1992 remarked that “crime around here is never really that bad.” Perhaps, thanks in part to the news media’s  exaggerated reports of damages to USC, older generations think of the area as crime-ridden and unsafe, when this was never the case.
In addition to this misrepresented violent past, current statistics also reinforce the relative safety of USC’s campus. In July 2017, The Daily Beast compiled a list of the 25 most crime-ridden college campuses, and USC did not even make the cut. While, universities like Yale and Tufts ranked 14th and 15th, respectively. The crime rate for the USC neighborhood over the past six months was 244.2, crimes per 10,000 people, slightly below the national average of 274.5 per 10,000 people. Living near USC’s campus is, if anything, marginally better than living in the United States as a whole.
These views of the USC area as an excessively crime-ridden neighborhood are not based in reality and are often predicated on assumptions made by affluent students and parents who are not familiar with the area. It’s easy for these privileged students to identify the Black and Latinx community members as a dangerous “other,” especially thanks to DPS crime reports. Many of these reports list the perpetrator as Black, male, late 20s, early 30s. 
These reports, which are shared with students through text and email, present a negative view of the community and those matching that description. Students’ impressions of the community should derive from interpersonal interactions with community members, not just from a crime blotter. While LAPD and DPS should continue to report accurately on crime in the area, USC students should have another frame of reference for their community members.
To combat these harmful preconceptions of surrounding South L.A. neighborhoods, USC should require students to volunteer for at least one semester with the Joint Education Project.  JEP and its associated programs ask for students to volunteer as tutors and classroom assistants for local students. These experiences range from helping students with science projects to editing college essays, forcing students to leave USC and work with students in their own classrooms. 
These firsthand experiences lend students a deeper understanding of the lives of those that live nearby. Requiring students to spend at least one semester working for JEP will help build empathy and understanding and enrich the lives of students as well as their mentees. Many humanities classes and even STEM classes offer extra credit or other incentives for students to take part in these programs. If students were required to participate in them, it would benefit their academic pursuits and encourage community engagement.
Even at the time of the riots, students recognized the value of programs like JEP. Paul Pinner, a student who attended USC during the riots, told the L.A. Times that “USC student involvement in such efforts as tutoring neighborhood children may have paid off in goodwill during the disturbances. ‘If USC is smart, it will continue to develop that.’” 
USC has continued to develop JEP and other similar programs.  If USC wishes to enjoy this close relationship with the community it must require that students take part in service programs. Required participation in these programs will instill a greater understanding of the surrounding community and correct perceptions regarding safety around and off-campus.

The USC Visions and Voices exhibition “10 Years of Blumhouse: From Paranormal Activity to Get Out and Beyond,” opened Monday in the School of Cinematic Arts’ Hugh Hefner Exhibition Hall to celebrate the independent horror film production company. The exhibit, which will run through Dec. 8, will also be accompanied by a series of weekly double feature screenings of Blumhouse Productions. The first event, featuring “Paranormal Activity” and “The Purge,” takes place 6 p.m. Friday at the Albert and Dana Broccoli Theatre. 
Placed just inside the SCA Complex’s George Lucas Lobby, the exhibit can easily grab visitors by surprise. Masks from “The Purge,” a detailed blue teacup from “Get Out” and eerie music from Blumhouse movies fill the gallery, inviting passersby to look closer. 
Hefner Hall has hosted similar exhibits, like “50 Years of Planet of the Apes,” in past years. 
“Once a semester, we put together a particular focus on something film-related, and it occurred to me that it had been 10 years since the release of ‘Paranormal Activity,’” said Alex Ago, SCA’s Director of Programming and Special Projects. “A lot of the events that I’ve done over the last year have been anniversary-oriented, so last year we did 40 years of ‘Alien,’ and here we’re doing 10 years of Blumhouse.”
Ago said he chose Blumhouse because of the company’s ability to grab people’s attention and his personal preference for horror.
“I happen to be a fan of horror films, and I love the movies that they make,” Ago said. “Like ‘Aliens’ and ‘Planet of the Apes,’ [the exhibit] is very visual, very eye-popping. You pass it, you want to look at it.”
Part of what makes Blumhouse so special, according to Ago, is that the studio provides a space for directors who don’t want to compromise their artistic vision. 
“In this era of hyper-inflated budgets, a lot of studios have cut the number of feature films that they make and dramatically inflate the budgets on the ones they do make,” Ago said.  “What Blumhouse is doing is the exact reverse. [They keep] these films down to between one and five million dollars, and they’re incredibly profitable … ‘Paranormal Activity’ was one of the most profitable films in history.”
In exchange for strict budgets, Blumhouse Productions allows its writers “unusual” freedom to write new stories, Ago said. This leads to some risk-taking creativity, and keeps theaters full with fresh plotlines. 
“There are always exceptions, but I would say their success rate both critically and commercially is unique in Hollywood right now,” Ago said.
Ago also put thought into which films he wanted to show as part of the screening series.
“One, I chose the core brand identity films, the films that spawn sequels,” Ago said, “I also wanted to show their prestige films. They now have three films that have been nominated for [the Academy Awards’] Best Picture, including ‘Get Out,’ ‘Whiplash’ and ‘BlacKkKlansman’ — those are absolutely essential.” 
Ago also wanted to feature films that couldn’t be seen on the big screen elsewhere. 
“There are four that came from the Hulu ‘Into the Dark’ series,” Ago said. “I think that they are a fantastic thing for people to experience together on the big screen, especially in a film school. The enthusiasm that I see in screenings here is so much better than when I go to see a film in a regular movie theater or a film that I see at home by myself. I wouldn’t say that that is specific to horror, but I think that horror in particular gains a lot from the communal experience, like a good comedy does.”
In conjunction with the exhibit and film screenings, Ago plans to organize a November panel starring Blumhouse Productions’ founder Jason Blum and led by School of Cinematic Arts professor Rebekah McKendry, a former Blumhouse employee who teaches horror at SCA. Ago and McKendry are currently organizing an on-campus live taping of “Shock Waves,” a Blumhouse podcast about horror films that McKendry hosts,  as part of the 10th anniversary Blumhouse event.
“Don’t just come to the ones that you’ve heard of,” Ago said. “Chances are in the past 10 years you’ve stumbled upon ‘Paranormal Activity’ or a ‘Purge’ movie, but you may have never even heard of ‘The Bay’ or these ‘Into the Dark’ movies. They’re all chosen for a reason.  I just want people to trust that someone really cared in the selection process and that you should take a chance on something you haven’t heard of before.”

Since I joined the Daily Trojan, I knew I wanted to write a column about weed. Even as I decided to pitch the idea, and even though I hold a valid medical license for marijuana, I struggled with the way this column would be perceived.
Although marijuana is becoming less and less taboo, stigmas surrounding the drug still persist. Historically, government-led propaganda and racist ideologies, coupled with a lack of research, fueled anti-marijuana rhetoric. These factors still linger to this day. However, as legalization gains ground, weed columns are popping up across prominent news outlets: The Denver Post now has the “The Cannabist,” while The Guardian has “High Time.” 
Since California legalized marijuana both recreationally and medically, I believe it’s high time (pun intended!) to discuss marijuana on a student platform. I want to dive deeper into all of the aspects of cannabis culture and explain the history, uses and benefits of the drug. I hope to educate and destigmatize marijuana, but first and foremost, I want to open an avenue for mature (yet fun) conversations.
 According to the Harvard Health Blog, about 85% of Americans support the legalization of medical marijuana, and 22% currently use marijuana, according to a survey conducted by Yahoo! News and Marist University. 33 states have legalized it for medical use, while 11 states have also legalized it recreationally. I support both medical and recreational legalization.
On the federal level, cannabis is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, on par with heroin and LSD, making it extremely difficult to research. While medical knowledge on weed is definitively lacking, there are conclusive results that indicate it does not harm long-term memory.
“My advice for doctors is that whether you are pro, neutral or against medical marijuana, patients are embracing it, and although we don’t have rigorous studies and gold standard proof of the benefits and risks of medical marijuana, we need to learn about it, be open-minded, and above all, be non-judgmental,” said Dr. Peter Grinspoon in a Harvard Health Blog post about medical marijuana.
Medical marijuana is proven to help people who face chronic pain, such as cancer patients, those suffering from endometriosis, fibromyalgia, Parkinson’s and more. 
Promising studies have shown medical marijuana can be useful in treating PTSD and other mental illnesses such as depression and general anxiety. As the opioid crisis worsens, medical marijuana has become an increasingly popular and desirable alternative, since it is much safer, less addictive and cannot result in an overdose.
There are many ways to consume cannabis, and they are becoming more abundant, ingenious and innovative. From vape pens and dabs to edibles and tinctures, there are more discreet ways to ingest marijuana than ever before. 
Recreational consumption often uses flower (or bud) that can be ground up in a grinder and rolled into joints (weed cigarettes) or blunts (the cigar equivalents of joints). Pipes and bongs, which use water, are also used for recreational use. Medical marijuana is administered more commonly via non-smoking forms.
Lastly, there are various strains of cannabis, all of which serve different purposes and treat different ailments. There are two main natural compounds found in marijuana plants: cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). CBD, the non-psychoactive ingredient, is extracted from hemp plants, which contain less than 0.3% THC, a psychoactive chemical. CBD does not give you a “high” and comes in gummy or supplement forms or can be infused in creams for pain relief. Although there are hundreds of cannabinoids in each cannabis plant, THC and CBD are mostly responsible for the strain’s effect.
 The world of weed is an ever-growing place, and I am still learning more about it every day. Even though smoking, paraphernalia and cannabis possession are prohibited on campus, people are beginning to embrace the drug and push for its decriminalization on the federal level. And as legalization gains ground throughout the country, there is hope that more research can be done so that barriers for treatment can be removed.
Natalie Oganesyan is a sophomore writing about weed culture and politics. Her column, “To be Blunt,” runs every other Thursday.

USC’s Health Sciences Campus installed new SmartFridges across facilities in late July to provide faculty, students and guests with healthy and accessible meals to go. The University installed the new technology to alleviate concerns that the 79-acre Lincoln Heights campus is a food desert.
According to Gary Marschall, the senior associate director of Retail Operations for USC, the refrigerators will ensure that there are more food options at HSC, which houses the Keck School of Medicine, the School of Pharmacy and three large teaching hospitals. 
“Over at the Soto buildings on the HSC campus, we were looking for alternatives for the people who were in those buildings,” Marschall said. “It’s kind of like a food desert, it’s very barren of food options over there.”
The SmartFridge an innovation created by Everytable, a company dedicated to providing healthy meals in food deserts, is narrower than a vending machine and can be accessed by swiping a credit card on the terminal. Users can open the fridge and examine various dining options. Once the user chooses their meal and closes the door, the fridge will scan its contents to determine the respective price of the item missing. For added convenience, the University also installed microwaves near the fridges to heat meals. 
“We decided to give it a shot and reached out to the folks that had the technology,” said Kris Klinger, the assistant vice president of USC Hospitality. “We are always idea-networking with what is out there and what we can bring to campus.”
According to Everytable CEO Sam Polk, the SmartFridges will bring made-from-scratch meals to more people in an efficient setting. 
“Many USC students and faculty visit our storefront at 23rd and Union, but a [fridge] on campus will provide 24/7 access to our meals,” Polk wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “In our journey, we’ve committed to serving the communities most vulnerable to food insecurity, and that includes college students.”
According to Klinger and Marschall, USC Hospitality initially considered the University Park Campus as a location to implement the smart fridges but decided that the HSC had a more urgent need for the food options. Conversations are currently ongoing to install the machines at University Park. 
Polk believes that food insecurity is a growing problem on college campuses that can affect a student’s academic performance. 
“We envision a day where no student has to worry about where their next meal will come from, and eventually, everyone across the country has access to healthy, affordable food,” Polk wrote.
According to Marschall, the  fridges have received positive responses so far.
“The reaction has been good. We had been letting the community know that [the fridges] were coming,” Marschall said. “A lot of people were aware of it and were excited to see what it was and give it a shot.”
The current menu is a collection of 50 of the top-rated items from Everytable. It includes dishes such as carnitas bowls, Jamaican jerk chicken bowls, spaghetti and meatballs and salads. According to Everytable, the menu is inspired by the culture and flavors of L.A.
Once the fridges have been operating for long enough, Everytable will be able to use its data to gain personalized feedback on how specific items are selling. 
“Vending in general is starting to go through some really big changes,” Marschall said. “It’s not your old school Coke machine or snack machine, there are going to be a lot more changes providing higher quality food.”

The sun had only just risen when Sasha Urban, a junior majoring in journalism, pulled out of a rental car garage to drive down Interstate 5 to San Diego County, where one of his sources lived.
“Before the summer started, going to someone’s house to interview them was the most terrifying thing I could have ever thought of,” Urban said. “[But] I probably went to five or six people’s houses for [my] story, and it was so, so worth it.” 
Urban was attempting to interview the former UCLA health director regarding Dennis Kelly, a former USC doctor accused of sexually assaulting former and current students. His investigation into Kelly and the University’s response to decades of allegations against the doctor was his focus as a reporter with the Beacon Project, a summer journalism initiative created by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. 
Participating students included Consuelo Cifuentes, who is pursuing a master’s degree in communication management; Sam Kmack and Ruby Yuan, seniors majoring in journalism; Austin Peay, a senior majoring in law, history and culture and classics; and Ashley Zhang, a sophomore majoring in political science.
The students worked full time for 12 weeks out of the Annenberg Media Center, investigating and reporting on various problems within the University. 
The Beacon Project was established following USC’s involvement in a national college admissions bribery scheme uncovered by the FBI earlier this year. Last spring, Annenberg faculty passed a resolution to independently investigate the University and its admissions system.
 “The school of journalism supported it, so that we were able to hire six reporters to be a part of this summer internship,” said Mark Schoofs, one of the professors who led the initiative. “Their job for the summer was to report on the University and related issues.”
Along with Schoofs, the project was led by faculty editors and Annenberg professors Christina Bellantoni, Gary Cohn and Gabe Kahn. During the summer, the reporters worked on the stories they pitched when they applied in April. While Urban focused on uncovering more information about allegations against Kelly in a report that was ultimately published in BuzzFeed News, Peay focused on investigating USC’s promises of transparency and the multiple internal investigations into the University. 
“We initially started to form [the internship] around the admissions scandal,” Bellantoni said. “We wanted to focus on that, but we knew this was a really important story. We said [to Urban], ‘Well, let’s see what you find.’ And he found material that [made us] sure this was indeed an important story.” 
As the final weeks of summer approached, students compiled their research and started drafting their stories with support from faculty editors. While both Urban and Peay’s investigations were published in Annenberg Media, Peay’s investigation was also published in LAist and Urban’s in BuzzFeed News.
“It was very independent,” Urban said. “They gave us so much autonomy … They really trusted us, like, ‘You know what to do. If you need to report, go do reporting.’ They’d say drive down to San Diego, and … I rented a car, and I drove down to San Diego [to do an] interview.”  
In response to Urban’s investigation, Interim Provost Elizabeth Graddy sent a University-wide email assuring that USC is doing its best to hear student concerns while balancing the sensitive information of open lawsuits. Additionally, the University reminded all students, faculty and staff of free counseling in the wake of the allegations against Kelly.
The University has not yet responded to Peay’s investigation. 
“It’s unprecedented for a journalism school to create a program to investigate its own University that upholds the highest standard of investigative journalism,” said Schoofs, formerly an investigative editor at BuzzFeed News. 
Annenberg offers several investigative reporting classes this fall, some taught by Schoofs and Cohn. The Beacon Projects ended with the summer, but several of the reporters hope to continue reporting as their stories develop.
“As long as you’re here, this is a community that anyone going here as a journalist has the ability to report on. It’s not something to take for granted,” Urban said. “This is the largest private employer in all of Los Angeles — the things that happen here matter to a lot of people.” 
 
This article was updated at 8:40 a.m. on Aug. 29. A previous version incorrectly stated that Urban drove to San Diego to interview Dennis Kelly. However, Urban drove to San Diego to interview a former UCLA Health Center director.

Amid an ongoing lawsuit filed against USC Aug. 15, restaurant The Butcher, The Baker, The Cappuccino Maker has closed its doors in USC Village, a University spokesperson confirmed Wednesday. 
The closure comes after BBCM and Rance’s Chicago Pizza, another restaurant at USC Village, filed a lawsuit claiming the University’s Real Estate and Asset Management team “deceived and defrauded tenants” to pay above-market rent prices for space.
The two restaurants, which held storefronts in USC Village since its opening in 2017, are suing the University for promissory fraud, misrepresentation and breach of contract. 
“The University believes the allegations that Rance’s and BBCM have made in their lawsuit are inaccurate, and we will vigorously defend against them in court,” USC wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
Store owners allege USC informed tenants that students would be allowed to use dining dollars to pay for meals and claimed the University failed to disclose the establishment of the USC Village Dining Hall. 
“The commercial tenants at the Village attempted numerous times to organize and address the giant contrast between what was represented and what was delivered,” the lawsuit read. “At every attempt, the tenants were met with threats of default and legal action by the REAM team.”
USC denied these claims. 
In a separate statement to the Daily Trojan Wednesday, USC confirmed BBCM’s closing and said it expects restaurants and retailers in USC Village to change over time. 
“It is common for retailers and restaurants to make business-based decisions about when to leave a location,” the statement read. “Ongoing change is expected as USC Village continues to partner with retailers and restaurants to provide the best mix of services for the University and the community.”
The University also wrote that it recently filed a separate court action against Rance’s for allegedly falling behind on its rent payments in the last several months. Rance’s did not immediately respond to the Daily Trojan’s request for comment.
Nathan Meyer, an attorney representing both restaurants, said his clients stand behind their allegations in the lawsuit and look forward to seeing the outcome once the case is taken to court. 
“At this time, it is our hope that we can arrive at a fair and amicable resolution between USC and our clients,” Meyer said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
According to the lawsuit, both restaurants were told by a REAM executive that students could use dining dollars as part of USC meal plans at restaurants in USC Village. BBCM said in the suit that the REAM executive framed the dining dollars as a selling point because it would bring a “significant boost” in revenue and used Seeds, another storefront at USC that accepts dining dollars, as an example. 
Five months before Rance’s opened in June 2017, co-owner Aaron Tofani said he  called the executive to discuss integrating a payment system to use dining dollars, but he said the system was still being set up, the lawsuit read. Tofani alleged he received a service proposal to implement Tapingo, a campus service that allows students to pay with dining dollars, at the restaurant. 
The lawsuit also states Rance’s finished the Tapingo deal in November 2017 -— five weeks before the store’s opening — but the restaurant was then informed that USC doesn’t allow Tapingo at privately-owned businesses. However, Rance’s still has a contract with Tapingo “in hopes of one day being added to the [USC meal plans], but has experienced minimal sales in the meantime just like other restaurants at the Village which have partnered with Tapingo,” the lawsuit read. 
In November 2017, the Daily Trojan editorial board also argued that the University should allow USC Village restaurants to accept dining dollars at their locations. 
“It feels like a contradiction, in the simplest of ways, that students still cannot use the currency designated as an inherent part of living and working on campus to purchase food from establishments in a new part of USC now embraced as part of its campus,” the editorial read. “It’s also an example of a concerning trend of shortsightedness University administrators have followed in their planning and envisioning of what USC Village was meant to be for their students and surrounding community.”
Rance’s and other USC Village tenants have continued asking for permission to accept dining dollars in their restaurants but have been denied each time, the suit said. 
Rance’s and BBCM also claim that they based revenue predictions on blueprints they were given of USC Village, which they said showed less restaurant competition and didn’t include plans for a new dining hall. 
Both restaurants added that they would not have opened locations in USC Village had they known the dining hall would be built there and said they’ve “suffered massive losses on a continuous basis” because of the competition from it and other restaurants. Rance’s and BBCM also said USC promised USC Village would hold farmer’s markets, tailgates and other events to draw traffic from the local community. 
When USC Village tenants wrote draft letters in May 2018 and early 2019 to raise these issues, the REAM executive “threatened” Rance’s and other tenants against signing the letter, the lawsuit said. Since then, the lawsuit said “tenants fear retaliation from REAM and have thus been very reluctant to work together or be perceived as working together.” 
The lawsuit alleges tenants were met with a similar response when they brought up above-market rates that have increased without notice, the lawsuit read.

For students across campus, USC Hillel, a small cottage tucked between campus and the Row, serves various purposes. Sometimes it’s a workspace, other times it’s a place for a home-cooked meal or an escape from the stress of college. Earlier this month, USC Hillel took on another role when it launched a wellness initiative to help students struggling with mental health.
The Bradley Sonnenberg Wellness Initiative funded by Glenn and Andrea Sonnenberg in honor of their late son and from Jewish Community Foundation of Los Angeles Cutting Edge Grant, will employ a full-time social work professional to take on the role of associate director of health and wellness. 
“In this plugged-in, ever-alienating society of ours, I think that there are not a lot of resources for people who may have issues,” Glenn Sonnenberg said. “Maybe not even big issues, but just day-to-day sort of making it through, [like] participating [in] activities with others and having a safe place to chill and maybe having somebody to talk to — it drove us to this wellness initiative.”
American college students show higher rates of diagnosis for poor mental health, particularly for anxiety, depression and panic attacks, according to a study published by the Journal of American College Health last year. USC Hillel already provides resources for students struggling with drug addiction and depression, but this initiative takes that support much further by adding professionalization to an already established wellness program. 
Putting student wellness high on the priority list is nothing new for USC Hillel. Past leadership, like former Executive Director Bailey London, emphasized Hillel’s role in addressing mental health on campus through informational workshops and organized activities that allowed students to unplug and take a breather. 
The Sonnenbergs additionally stressed the importance of placing the initiative within reach of any student seeking help or someone to talk to, regardless of religious identity.
“The [Engemann Student Health Center] is not able to help everybody,” Andrea Sonnenberg said. “They’re overwhelmed by the demand. People can’t get in; they can’t get in for months, and they only get a certain number of sessions, so that’s part of the reason why the need is so great. There’s just not the supply.”
Dave Cohn, who is starting as this year’s executive director for USC Hillel, hopes to carry on the legacy that past leadership has instituted in making student wellness a high priority. Cohn previously worked for Hillel at UCLA and has spent years with college students at summer camps and university camps. 
“Anyone who works on campus [knows] the pressures students face and the varying ways, and sometimes specialized ways, we might need to offer to respond to those pressures and to encourage healthy balance,” Cohn said.
Hillel also plans to continue weekly activities such as hiking, yoga and community sports as a part of its physical wellness program. 
Ilana Cohen, a junior studying cognitive science who frequently visits Hillel, said she hopes students will take advantage of the resources available through the initiative. 
“In the past, especially recently, there were all these attacks on the Jewish community, and Hillel was a really great space to go to,” Cohen said. “They react and take care of the students immediately, and they bring you in. So this initiative is great because even outside the Jewish community things are always going on and problems are always arising. You always will need someone to talk to.”

Most men, other than medical professionals, don’t know what a pelvic exam is. In a nutshell, it’s a procedure that doctors perform on patients to evaluate the patient’s reproductive organs. The exam lasts only a few minutes, with the doctor checking the vulva, vagina, cervix, ovaries, uterus, rectum and pelvis for any abnormalities. It also usually includes a Pap smear, a test carried out on a sample of cells from the cervix to check for abnormalities. As routine and vital as this procedure may sound, it is one of the most controversial in the modern age of medicine due to alleged sexual misconduct perpetrated by doctors like Michigan State University’s former doctor Larry Nassar and, of course, former USC gynecologist George Tyndall. 
More than 700 former patients have filed individual suits against Tyndall. During the course of his pelvic exams, Tyndall would make inappropriate comments and wouldn’t use gloves to conduct the exam. After news of Tyndall’s misconduct broke, the Engemann Student Health Center took precautions for pelvic exams, such as providing a pre-exam form and a detailed explanation of what occurs during the exam, among other alleged misconduct. 
More or less as a result of the Tyndall’s alleged misconduct, California Assembly Democrats Ian Calderon and Cottie Petrie-Norris introduced legislation in February that requires doctors to give first-time patients a pamphlet explaining proper conduct for the exam as well as a phone number to report misconduct to the state medical board. 
California is just one of a dozen states that have introduced similar measures that require women who are receiving gynecological procedures to explicitly give approval beforehand. While the proposed laws are intended to eliminate any question of patient consent, they are meeting a surprising opposition coalition: the doctors themselves.
In California, two powerful medical groups, the California Medical Association and the California Academy of Family Physicians, oppose the bill’s signature requirement because they say it would cause burdensome paperwork and could potentially cause victims to blame themselves. The various medical organizations’ concerns can be described in one polite phrase: well-intentioned. 
Proposed consent form laws in California and Michigan, and similar laws that have already passed the Utah, Maryland and New York state legislatures, are necessary. Consent forms are not only for the protection of the patients but also for the doctors. 
“This is a new age, where previously condoned male behaviors toward women are no longer considered acceptable,” The Medical Board of California said in a 1994 statement regarding accusations of sexual misconduct allegations against physicians.
10 or even 20 years ago, jokes that would socially crucify a person today were laughed at heartily in a theater room. The way men conduct themselves toward women has progressed in the right direction, but that direction could lead to walking off a cliff. This generational gap between patient and doctor might have been a contributor to the abuse that Tyndall subjected his patients to. While definitely not an excuse, the generational gap is a factor in sexual misconduct and may lead to a solution –– the consent form. 
Accusations of misconduct can stem from poor physician-to-patient communication regarding the procedure of the examination. The consent form would be an avenue to remedy this. Had a consent form existed when Tyndall was at USC, it may have served as a deterrent to his behavior. 
Gone are the days of the house-call doctor who ran his medical practice out of his home with few standards for conduct. Physicians are supposed to do no harm, but that oath seems to have become soluble in the 21st century. The actions of Tyndall, Nassar and other doctors who took advantage of their position are emblematic of the epidemic plaguing college campus health centers across the nation. A pelvic exam consent form would help minimize the risk of any potential misconduct taken by the healthcare provider.

After starting its season with two commanding victories over Hawaii and San Francisco, the No. 5 USC women’s soccer team returns to Los Angeles Thursday for its first home game of the season against the Florida Gators in “The Battle at the Banc.”
The Trojans will then go on to face defending national champion Florida State on Sunday, giving them the opportunity to avenge last year’s loss in the Sweet 16.
Although USC faces a relatively quick turnaround between playing Florida Thursday and FSU Sunday, senior midfielder Jalen Woodward noted that the team is in great shape and that the players are both physically and mentally prepared.
The Trojans have not allowed a single goal in their first two games, adding two shutouts to the resume of redshirt junior goalkeeper Kaylie Collins. The defense has made Collins’ job easy so far, allowing just nine total shots. 
Forwards sophomore Penelope Hocking and junior Tara McKeown have been a successful pair up front. McKeown has started the year off especially strong with two goals and an assist to her name.
“Tara has always been good, but she’s been exceptional so far this season,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “You can tell that she’s come back fitter than ever before and has a new focus, and it has shown in her production.”
The Trojans will hope to continue their streak of shutouts against Florida, but this will be no easy task. The Gators are coming in with momentum after upsetting No. 18 South Florida with a 2-0 shutout of their own. Florida will face one of the most difficult schedules in the nation but look to have a tough team with players that have a chip on their shoulder.
Defensively, the Trojans will need to stop junior forward Deanne Rose, who has started her 2019 campaign at a blazing pace with three goals and an assist in just two games.
“[Rose] is very, very patient,” McAlpine said. “The key is going to be staying connected with her, knowing where she is and trying to get her receiving balls facing negative as much as possible.”
McAlpine will look to the defensive duo of seniors Ashleigh Plumptre and Julia Bingham to hamper Rose. However, Rose will not be the only player the Trojans have to worry about, as the well-rounded Florida squad has been posting solid offensive numbers as a unit.
“They are a really great position team,” Woodward said. “They can move the ball really well. I think that one thing that we’ve been really focusing on this preseason is working on our defensive strategies.”
On offense, the team must capitalize on a Florida defense that has a tendency to concede many shots. The Gators have already allowed 30 shots in their first two games, and if this trend continues, it could prove advantageous to the Trojan offense.
“The game plan is to try to exploit them with our two forwards primarily getting behind the defense and making the centerbacks work,” McAlpine said.
So far, USC has produced a high number of shots against its opponents, including 23 shots on goal. The combination of numerous scoring opportunities and high shooting percentage could overwhelm Florida’s defense if USC executes well.
Ultimately, this game will be USC’s first real test against a tough opponent. Florida could easily jump into the Top 25 after its win against South Florida and can only improve with a win against the Trojans.
Although Florida is a challenging opponent, the Trojans will face an even tougher test in their rematch against Florida State. The No. 1-ranked team in the nation has also gotten off to a strong start with two shutouts against two solid teams in TCU and No. 16 Wisconsin. In their most recent match against Wisconsin, though, the Seminoles struggled to score and failed to capitalize until overtime.
FSU will field a less explosive offense than some other top-ranked teams, but its defense has played well so far, allowing just 11 shots in both games. It will be important for Hocking and McKeown to create shot opportunities against the Seminoles’ tough back line.
FSU also boasts four Hermann watch list candidates, along with a number of returners from the 2018 National Championship team.
The Trojans kick off against Florida 8 p.m. Friday at Banc of California Stadium and face Florida State 2 p.m. Sunday at UCLA’s Wallis Annenberg Stadium.

Tua Tagovailoa, Trevor Lawrence, Jake Fromm, Jalen Hurts and Justin Herbert. To find a better crop of quarterbacks in college football, you’d have to look back to 2003 when Philip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Eli Manning and Matt Leinart lit up their respective campuses. This influx of quarterback talent came about due to a variety of factors — the advent of quarterback coaches and camps, more spread offenses and rule changes that benefit offensive players. Whatever the cause, to win a national title in 2019, teams need to have an elite quarterback. 
In recent history, this hasn’t always been the case.
Alabama head coach Nick Saban built a dynasty by pairing elite defenses with punishing run games. Since 2009, he’s won rings with placeholders like Greg McElroy, A.J. McCarron and Jake Coker. None of these players were bad per se, but none were elite prospects. They also have just four NFL starts between them.
The tides turned, however, in the 2018 National Championship game. Georgia had Alabama on the ropes in the first half, stifling Hurts to the tune of three completions on eight pass attempts. Saban had seen enough and replaced Hurts with the dynamic freshman Tagovailoa. Tagovailoa tossed three touchdowns in a come-from-behind win that would forever etch him into college football lore. Since that game, Saban has had a bona fide offensive weapon at quarterback for the first time in his tenure. 
Since Alabama remains college football’s measuring stick, that means that the rest of the nation now needs an elite defense, a physical running back and a NFL-caliber quarterback to hang with the Tide. 
In 2018, Clemson found its guy in Trevor Lawrence, and it worked. Standing 6-foot-6 with long blonde hair, Lawrence looks more like a guy playing a quarterback on TV than an actual quarterback. But he doesn’t just look the part. Lawrence threw for six touchdowns and no interceptions over two games in last year’s playoff, ultimately torching Alabama in the title game. By out-dueling Tagovailoa, Lawrence and Clemson beat Alabama at its own game. 
Both Tagovailoa and Lawrence are back in 2019, a true miracle from the football gods. Tagovailoa has a score to settle and Lawrence has to go out and prove he’s not a one-hit wonder like so many frontmen from the 1980s who shared his hairstyle. We’re past the days of Alabama grinding out opponents with the run game en route to the national championship. It’s highly possible that last year’s playoff featured not one, not two, but three quarterbacks who will be selected No. 1 overall between 2019 selection Kyler Murray, Tagovailoa (eligible in 2020) and Lawrence (eligible in 2021). 
It may seem inevitable that Tagovailoa and Lawrence will meet again for a national title. After all, Clemson and Alabama have faced off in each of the last four playoffs. But they won’t be without competition on the road to New Orleans. 
Alabama and Tagovailoa must go through Jake Fromm and Georgia, their stoutest competition in the Southeastern Conference over the last two seasons. Fromm may not possess the athleticism or arm talent of his Hawaiian counterpart, but statistically, the junior is one of the most efficient quarterbacks in college football. Last season, Fromm ranked fifth nationally with a 171.3 passer rating and completed 67.4% of his passes, good for ninth in the country according to USA Today. He’s led the Bulldogs to big leads over Alabama in each of the last two seasons, but each time they slipped on banana peels at the finish line like one would in a Mario Kart race. This is a put-up or shut-up year for Fromm, who’s always been steady but now needs to add more wow-factor to his game. Like Lawrence and Tagovailoa, he’s expected to be a first round draft choice whenever he decides to make the leap to the NFL. 
I’m over 600 words into this column and I’ve barely touched on Oregon’s Justin Herbert, who many analysts thought would be the No. 1 overall selection in the 2019 NFL Draft. Instead he decided to return for his senior year, making the Ducks instant contenders for the title. Throughout his career, Herbert has missed several games and struggled with consistency — he completed just 50% of his passes in a loss to Arizona in 2018 — but the physical tools have always been there. And Oregon now has enough talent around him to return to the glory years of, like, five minutes ago (OK, five years ago). 
Add in Texas’s Sam Ehlinger, who wears out opponents with his physicality like a 240-pound running back, or Hurts, who transferred from Alabama to Oklahoma to replace Murray. Hurts looked like a vastly improved player when he came in for Tagovailoa in the 2018 SEC Championship Game. Now he’s under the tutelage of Lincoln Riley, who coached the last two Heisman Trophy winners and No.1 overall draft picks. No big deal or anything. 
It’s never easy to predict what will happen in college football, but this much is clear: 2019 will be defined by the quarterbacks.

USC women’s volleyball enters the 2019 season with some fresh faces following last season’s upsetting finish. The No. 21 Trojans placed third in the Pac-12 with a 13-7 conference record yet failed to emerge from the second round of the NCAA tournament. 
The Trojans will have very little time to get over any potential early-season rust, as they face three top-20 opponents in their first five matches of the year.
“We have to wake up really early in the season and see who we are,” All-American senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier said. “It’ll be really exciting to play these great [competitors] and see what we can do early on and just get better from there.”
The Trojans have brought in two liberos, freshman Keila Barra and graduate Abril Bustamante — the latter of whom plays for the beach volleyball team — to replace recent graduates Victoria Garrick and Reni Meyer-Whalley. Barra and Bustamante will be expected to step up quickly as the Trojans need a solid back row against tough competition early this season.
One bright spot for the Trojans last year was setter Raquel Lázaro, but even after winning Pac-12 Freshman of the Year honors, the talented sophomore still sees plenty of room for improvement.
“For me, it wasn’t that good of a season, and I think I can do a lot better,” Lázaro said. 
Lázaro proved herself as the team’s leading setter with 1,402 assists last year; the next closest Trojan had just 123. However, she is not taking her success for granted. Heading into the two-a-day practices, Lázaro feels like she has to earn her job in each workout and has her sights set on the Pac-12 Setter of the Year award.
“I know it will be difficult [to win the award],” Lázaro said. “But I want to be the best I can be for my team.”
Head coach Brent Crouch is returning for his second year with USC and is focused on building chemistry between the players and coaching staff well before the season gets underway. 
“Establishing trust with [the coaches] throughout the spring was a really big growing period,” Lanier said. “They are giving us a bigger hand in what we want to do and where we want to take this team.”
The Trojans stumbled toward the end of the regular season in 2018, narrowly defeating a subpar UCLA squad they swept in the conference opener.
To avoid a similar decline in 2019, the Trojans will have to maintain their physical conditioning through the end of the season. 
“Last year at the end of the season, my body wasn’t as well-prepared as it was in the beginning,” Lázaro said. “Now I know at the end of the season I need to prepare my body better. Now I know how I need to prepare myself for each part of the season.”
Along with Barra and Bustamante, USC brought in junior opposite Candice Denny and freshman outside hitter Emilia Weske to round out its roster heading into the season. The newcomers should help strengthen a roster that lacked depth during an injury-plagued 2018.
“We [added] another exceptional group of student-athletes to our already loaded 2019 class and are now two- to three-deep at every position on the court,” Crouch said in a June interview with USC Athletics. “I expect the level of competition in practice to soar and [for us] to be able to absorb the inevitable injuries that are a part of the game. Each of the players in this group exhibits the skill, athleticism, intelligence and character standards that we hold for the Trojan Family.”
Lanier compared the roster to the 2017 team that advanced to the NCAA regional match against Florida. 
“I think having a deep roster is really important,” Lanier said. “We have a lot of transfers and freshmen coming in, so for the returners it’s really good to have our limits pushed by these new people, learn what we can from them and then teach them our philosophies along the way.”
The Trojans will have their first opportunity to show off that depth this Friday against Texas State in San Marcos, Texas. The Bobcats posted an impressive 27-7 record last season, advancing to the second round of the NCAA tournament before losing in three sets to Texas. Texas State enters the season unranked despite receiving six votes in the AVCA coaches poll. 
After the contest with the Bobcats, USC will travel to Austin for a Sunday matchup with an elite Texas squad that enters the season ranked No. 4 in the AVCA coaches poll. The Longhorns are coming off a 2018 season that saw them go 23-5 and earn a spot in the NCAA quarterfinals. 
Friday’s game will begin at 5 p.m., and Sunday’s is set for an 11 a.m. start.

With the season opener against Fresno State just two days away, the energy among the USC football team is high.
The Trojans emerged from Wednesday’s practice with a renewed sense of vigor and focus for Saturday’s game. Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s unit, which ranked an abysmal 59th in the nation last season, is looking to re-establish its authority in the Pac-12.
“We see a lot of wide open teams in this conference,” Pendergast said. “Every week is going to be based off of how we feel our matchups are … We’ve been able to go into a fourth year of recruiting different types of bodies to play different types of defense. I feel like we’re at the point now where we can do that.”
The Trojans seem confident in their ability to take on Fresno State’s relatively inexperienced offense. The Bulldogs’ senior quarterback Jorge Reyna has never started a game with Fresno State and has only passed for 111 yards and a touchdown in his college career.
“[The team’s confidence] is at an all-time high,” redshirt senior defensive lineman Christian Rector said. “It’s right where it needs to be.”
Despite Fresno State’s apparent weakness behind center, Rector emphasized that the Trojans will not be taking their opponent lightly. He said that the Bulldogs’ discipline and smart coaching make the team a force to be reckoned with. Head coach Jeff Tedford has revived Fresno State from a 1-11 program to the Mountain West conference champion in just three years.
Pendergast, who worked with Tedford from 2010 to 2012 at Cal, echoed Rector’s sentiment.
“He’s always evolving with his offensive scheme and system,” Pendergast said. “You can see the differences from where it was when we worked together at Cal. One thing I know about him is that he’s always going to utilize his players.”
In response to Tedford’s offensive strategy, Pendergast plans to use his defensive players in a myriad of placements. He has moved redshirt sophomore cornerback Greg Johnson to the nickelback position, citing his versatility, coverage skills and physicality as main reasons for the change. Johnson has become a leader on this young defense, which lost captains Cameron Smith and Porter Gustin to the NFL after the 2018 season.
Rector has also taken it upon himself to show new players the ropes. 
“It’s been great to step up and become a leader for this team,” Rector said. “We have a lot of talented guys, so that makes my job really easy. Being in that [leadership] position isn’t totally new to me, but it is a fun position to be in.”
The Trojans’ main focus on both sides of the ball will be simplicity and consistency. New offensive coordinator Graham Harrell has significantly simplified the offensive playbook, narrowing the players’ repertoire down to about 20 plays. This should allow sophomore quarterback JT Daniels to make quicker decisions in the pocket and more readily connect with his receivers.
The Trojans will arrive at Saturday’s game with one of the fiercest wide receiving squads in the NCAA. Their four best receivers from 2018 — sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown, redshirt juniors Tyler Vaughns and Velus Jones Jr. and senior Michael Pittman Jr. — will once again be options downfield for Daniels.
In order to succeed this Saturday, the Trojans will certainly need to rely on their passing game. Daniels averaged 243 yards passing and -13.5 yards rushing per game in 2018, and Harrell’s Air Raid strategy takes advantage of the quarterback’s clear strengths while minimizing his weaknesses.
No matter how prepared the Trojans seem, the players are acutely aware of the expectations of fans who were disappointed in the team’s performance last season.
“I’m confident in [our team],” Rector said. “But that doesn’t mean anything until you see us go out and play.”

In the midst of a dinner rush at Grand Central Market, secluded from the main arteries of the food hall gushing with people, I’m sitting perched on a barstool, staring at a wall of bagged tostadas. In front of me is a plate piled high with fresh shrimp ceviche, speckled with crisp cucumber and cilantro. A single bite and the sounds of the market are drowned out with the crunch of tostada, complementing the bright ceviche with the subtle flavors of toasted corn and oil. 
La Tostaderia was one of my favorite restaurants in Grand Central Market. Despite its high prices, I liked the staff, and the tostadas were —
“Hey, have you ever heard of Yerba Mate?”
I stop, mid-chew, to stare up at the bearded 20-something leaning against the bar next to me.
“What?” I ask. Does he not register my headphones? The book in my hand? The fact that I am sitting alone?
“Have you ever heard of Yerba Mate?”
“Well, yeah.”
“It’s way healthier than that stuff.” He gestures to the can of Monster Energy beside my plate of ceviche. 
“Oh, yeah, energy drinks are kind of a vice of mine.”
“Well Yerba Mate’s got a lot of caffeine in it, but it’s all natural. Tastes good too.”
“Oh, OK.” Who was this guy? Was he a Yerba Mate salesperson? Why was he telling me what to drink?
“Yeah. I work at Belcampo, I just had to come over and tell you.”
“Thanks.”
“Would you maybe wanna go out sometime?”
I think the best way to describe Grand Central Market as it currently stands is by the Belcampo Meat Co. employee who tried to shame me into dating him.
Grand Central Market encapsulates everything good and bad about current restaurant trends in Los Angeles. Most of the food is expertly-crafted, varied and fresh, albeit at a high price point. There’s obvious respect for the city’s history, but there’s also an ambition to break into a new audience and to start new fads. And, in the pursuit of creating something new, Grand Central Market has erased something old.
The market is a surviving relic from more than a century ago, weathering the drastic changes Downtown Los Angeles has seen. When it was first established, it catered to the elite higher class living in the city, functioning as a traditional market for those who could afford fresh meat and produce. As the rich left downtown in the coming decades, Grand Central Market became a primarily Latinx shopping center, selling imported produce and spices from Mexico. To this day, Latinx influence permeates throughout the food hall — vendors like Tacos a Tumbras, Chiles Secos and Valeria’s Chiles and Spices have been around for decades. 
In the early 2010s, Grand Central Market underwent a series of transformations, introducing new vendors to revitalize the struggling dining center. Over the next few years, the market became a pioneering food hall and quintessential tourist destination. Vendors like Eggslut and Sari Sari Store have garnered critical acclaim, while restaurants like the vegan Ramen Hood or nostalgia-centered PBJ.LA have tapped into new markets within the city. The entire market smells of a hundred different things at once — grilling meat, cooking garlic, waffle cones, fresh masa. The narrow hallways between stalls are constantly filled with eager-eyed visitors overwhelmed by neon signs and the sheer spectacle of it all. 
While the owners of Grand Central Market claim that the new business draws in all types of people, it is clear that these new customers are mostly white, well-off or tourists. Legacy vendors are overlooked in light of newer, more popular stalls, and the sweeping hand of gentrification across downtown has displaced many of their regulars. The historical Grand Central Market is quickly being forgotten.  	
In a way, Grand Central Market serves as a microscopic view of the changing landscape across East and Downtown Los Angeles, as richer, whiter populations push out Latinx communities and attract new businesses. It demonstrates the excellent culinary progress this city has made but also showcases the ugliness such an expansion brings with it. 
Ironically, Grand Central Market has completed a full circle, catering to the rich yet again. And despite the undoubted impact it has made on L.A.’s food culture in recent years, I can’t help but feel torn eating there. 
Also, who the hell thinks that insulting someone’s taste is going to make them want to date you?
I gave him my number but never texted him back.

In the post-“Get Out” era of horror-comedy, it’s difficult to see new films without the veil of the movies’ shadow. “Ready or Not,” a horror comedy produced by USC alumnis Tripp Vinson and James Vanderbilt, is no freer of that burden than any other new horror film. From the moment the camera pulls away from a sinister shot of a devil playing cards to a strictly humorous scene, it is difficult to avoid that connection.
To its credit, the film never feels like a cheap copy of the former but almost like a logical alternative. Here, instead of race relations, the cinematic conversation centers on the rich. Yet, the film never feels preachy, nor does it obsess itself with forcing social commentary.
The movie consistently walks a tightrope between seemingly opposing conventions and ideas. The opening scene is dim and gloomy in typical horror or thriller movie fashion. The scene that immediately ensues, along with the timing and stylistic decisions of the title cards, makes the film feel like it might be a light-hearted comedy, yet the film is neither. At times it favors drama or leans into its gorier elements, but never for long and never free of another thematic or genre dimension. 
The movie’s ability to introduce social commentary in a way that is immediately visible, but not especially forced or obsessive, is commendable. It’s obvious “Ready or Not” is poking fun at the 1% by positioning the richest characters as the most evil — we see this most directly with the way that Charity Le Domas is portrayed. 
The most striking feature of this film is not its ability to catapult us from emotion to opposing emotion or from character allegiance to opposing character allegiance, rather it is the remarkable ability to do both at once — to make the viewer both hate a character and root for them against all others, to have laugh and be repulsed by any singular action.
Unexpectedly (and even more proficiently than “Get Out”), “Ready or Not” is masterful in its manner of evoking emotional plurality, in the viewer, especially in a way where the joke or gore feels earned and genuine. When there’s a shot of the main character, Grace (Samara Weaving) getting injured, for instance, it never feels like it’s for the sake of blood.
The film’s weakest moments were mostly with respect to specific characters and performances, mostly early on in the film. Aunt Helene, played by Nicky Guadagni, in particular, feels a bit cartoonish in her villainy. Her introductory shots and much of the performance felt cheap or embellished. Given the surrounding performances and overall sincerity of the film, much of her character felt drawn on. In the beginning, some of Andie MacDowell’s boisterous Becky Le Domas performance was also distracting.
Yet the film had many layered and believable performances by its leads. Adam Brody did a wonderful job of showing Daniel Le Domas’ internal struggle in a manner that felt rounded and emotionally impactful. Mark O’Brien’s character, Alex Le Domas, has a series of devastating and shocking experiences, the toll of which O’Brien demonstrated beautifully. And finally Weaving, who played the protagonist Grace, did a beautiful job of making each additional devastation feel new and affecting.
This film felt absurd yet logical. The premise and actions taken by the characters were always surprising, but never lost their sense of inevitability
“Ready or Not” was delightful to watch. The story feels original and compelling while maintaining a lot of emotional dexterity and control, which is a credit to screenwriters Guy Busick and Ryan Murphy as well as many of the actors. It truly does meet, and in some respects exceed, the “Get Out” benchmark.

Roski School of Art and Design is embedded in Los Angeles and boasts a symbiotic relationship with the city. L.A. holds the largest art museum in the western United States, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Gagosian Gallery and the Getty Museum all within a few miles of one another — and from USC. 
For incoming and current Roski students, that proximity offers the thrilling possibility for new experiences and opportunities. However, as a first-time college student, navigating a new university and a new metropolis may be overwhelming. 
“L.A. is a haven for creatives,” said Lily Krausz, a junior majoring in art. “There is inspiration everywhere — museums, activities, people. Roski encourages you to get involved with the broader arts community in L.A. as well, with lots of field trips and assignments that show you what the arts scene has to offer. We are right next to downtown L.A. which has an awesome arts district, which is a great source to draw inspiration from.”
Talia Malchin, a junior at Roski majoring in design, notes the importance of art in all L.A. communities. 
“Whether it be within Roski, which has its own endless variety of styles and passions for art or around campus across all majors, students that are drawn to L.A. seem to be generally into their different forms of art like music, fashion or photography,” Malchin said. “L.A. also has infinite opportunities to experience high quality art from so many different cultures, so there’s no shortage of inspiration.”
At Roski, students do not major in a specific medium but rather have the freedom to choose a more personalized path. From digital media to printmaking classes, Roski students are given the freedom to tailor their education to fit individual passions. 
“Spend time getting to know your Roski cohort,” Krausz said. “That’s where your professional developments will be made and it’s important to make connections there. Join a club outside of Roski to avoid feeling pigeonholed.”  
Outside of her classes, Krausz has consulted on student magazines and has enjoyed being a part of a creative team. She also mentioned that if students join Greek life, members can design apparel or merchandise — another way Roski students can embed their talents and values in other spheres. Malchin plays club soccer and enjoys finding friends that she might not have crossed paths with otherwise.
“Get close to faculty,” Krausz recommended. “They are your resource, don’t go through the motions — small class sizes and studio courses means professors are your best source for creative direction.”
Malchin also advises newcomers to maintain connections with faculty. 
“I had a lot of repeat professors and it’s great to have that relationship going into a new class,” Malchin said. “Ask questions and don’t be afraid to be honest about your opinion.”
One of Malchin’s favorite experiences was working on her final for her drawing class freshman year. 
“I was super ambitious with the project and ended up ordering way too few materials and had to improvise, but it ended up even better than I had intended,” she said. “It was a great learning experience for both planning and executing future products.”
