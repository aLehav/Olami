The aftershock of the NCAA sanctions handed down to USC in June has not ended quite yet.
On Thursday, the Football Writers Association of America stripped the Trojans of the 2004 Grantland Rice Trophy, which was awarded to them after their 55-19 victory over Oklahoma in the 2005 BCS championship game.
The award, which has existed since 1954, is given annually to the football team voted the national champion by the FWAA. No team has ever been stripped of the trophy prior to USC.
FWAA president Tim Griffin made it clear that, while retroactive, the vacating of the award was necessary.
“Had these facts been known, USC would not have been selected for the award … in light of standards applicable to FWAA poll participants, award candidates and award recipients,” said Griffin in a statement released Thursday.
In response to the FWAA’s decision, USC athletic director Pat Haden announced in a statement Thursday that the 2004 trophy would be returned.
“Due to the NCAA penalties, we understand the actions taken by the Football Writers Association of America and we will abide by that ruling,” Haden said. “While we know that some fans and former student-athletes may be disappointed, our central priority at this time is our overall commitment to compliance and this action is in line with the standards we have set for our entire athletic program.”
USC is also not eligible for the 2010 award, although the Trojans will remain in the 2010 FWAA preseason rankings.

Follow the money.
That was the directive given by the mysterious Deep Throat to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward in the film version of All the President’s Men, the account of how two journalists uncovered one of our nation’s most infamous political scandals.
Although the recent NCAA sanctions on USC athletics pale in comparison to Richard Nixon’s Watergate in scope and impact, I decided to take Deep Throat’s advice.
The bowl ban, loss of scholarships, forfeiture of wins — we’ve all heard the penalties. But what will be the impact on the bottom line?
While combing through the financial report filed by the USC athletic department in compliance with the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, several figures jumped out to me.
First thing’s first, USC athletics is a big business. For the 2008-2009 fiscal year, the last report made available to the public, USC reported a balanced budget of just more than $80 million.
USC pays more than $13 million in salaries alone to head and assistant coaches for the school’s 19 varsity teams.
Add to that more than 150 support staff employees in charge of marketing, equipment, fundraising, sports information and athletic training that need salaries and benefits, and you begin to realize that a major drop in revenue would affect a lot of people.
Second, the Trojan Family isn’t just a clever way to sell the school to prospective students. USC reported nearly $39 million in unallocated revenues, which are made up primarily of gifts from alumni and athletic support groups.
Some media members have suggested over the last few months that if the NCAA really wanted to punish USC, it would recoup all the revenue made by the school while Reggie Bush was deemed ineligible.
I’d wager, however, that even if the NCAA had the power and desire to assess hefty fines to USC, Trojan boosters would reach deeper into their pockets to support the school’s sports teams during the difficult time.
The other big-time moneymaker for USC — football — raked more than $35 million into Heritage Hall coffers in 2008-2009. After expenses, Trojan football earned profits of $14 million, the only team on campus to finish the year in the black.
With virtually every other USC team banking on the financial well-being of football, the question remains: How much will that football-related revenue drop because of the NCAA sanctions?
In short, not much.
The current two-year bowl ban, while not enjoyable for Trojan coaches, players and fans, won’t break the bank for the athletic department.
USC will miss out on profits from selling official Trojan bowl game merchandise at the campus bookstore and other various retail outlets, as well as revenue generated if the Trojans made a national championship appearance.
A potential national championship, something made impossible this season, wouldn’t hurt donations either.
The much-publicized bowl game payouts, however, won’t be missed.
Every winter, the bowl committees and their sponsors promote how much prize money comes along with playing in their games.
The Bowl Championship Series members highlight their $17-million payouts for participating in one of their five games.
Schools in the Pac-10 conference, however, split the money evenly among all 10 members after the participating school covers its bowl-game related expenses.
In 2008-2009, the 10 schools split slightly more than $25 million in bowl game revenue. The NCAA penalties do not prohibit USC from continuing to collect their share of the spoils, bowl game or not.
Also, the Trojans escaped what would have been a pain-in-the-pocketbook television ban, a penalty the school received for athletic department infractions in 1957, 1959 and 1982.
While 45 percent of the Pac-10 conference’s television revenue is split up evenly among the 10 schools, the other 55 percent is based on actual TV appearances during the season.
With a successful team in the nation’s second-largest media market, it’s no surprise that USC pulls in the biggest share of the revenue in the conference — about $4.5 million more over the last two years than the second biggest earner, Oregon.
With eight Trojan football games scheduled to air on ESPN or ABC and four more to be televised by Fox Sports this season (the UCLA game broadcast information has yet to be announced), USC will continue to bring in big-time TV money.
The athletic department’s actions over the summer don’t seem to indicate a financial panic either. The school said goodbye to former Athletic Director Mike Garrett (who in all probability received a nice chunk of change on his way out) and hired Pat Haden to take over (who surely isn’t being paid in pennies).
The school also beefed up its compliance department and hired former FBI director Louis J. Freeh to assess the athletic department’s culture and procedures to try to prevent NCAA sanctions in the future.
So where did the money lead us?
For a football program surrounded by question marks heading into the new season, one thing is certain: Money won’t be the problem.

Intent on rebounding from a frustrating 1-0 season-opening loss to San Diego, the USC women’s soccer team must bear the Texas heat this weekend as it squares off against Texas Christian University and the University of Texas at Austin in two non-conference matchups.
Moving on · Junior midfielder Carly Butcher looks to continue her strong play as the soccer team travels to Texas for two games this weekend. - Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan 
On Friday, the Women of Troy will kick off their road schedule against TCU (1-1); from there, they will travel farther south to face Texas (1-0) on Sunday.
Despite the disheartening beginning to the season, which included being dropped unceremoniously from the top 25 rankings, the team is not dwelling on its opponents. When asked about the challenges TCU and Texas pose, coach Ali Khosroshahin turned his focus to the Women of Troy.
“To be honest, the biggest challenge is ourselves,” Khosroshahin said. “Right now, the biggest challenge is the ball and ourselves.”
Evident in Khosroshahin’s response was not only the frustration that accompanies an unexpected early-season loss, but also his steadfast confidence in his team.
During practices, he has emphasized maintaining formation as the team progresses down the field and staying connected. And as senior striker Megan Ohai pointed out, by staying in their own lanes, the Women of Troy can stretch the field and make themselves more difficult to defend.
“We weren’t doing the little things,” Ohai said. “Everyone needs to work together and get on the other side of some of these crosses.”
Undoubtedly, teamwork is how the Women of Troy will generate more offense and enjoy sustained success this season.
“If we don’t connect, we won’t generate anything. It’s all based on the same thing,” Khosroshahin said.
In TCU and Texas, USC faces two unfamiliar opponents, both unranked and coming off of mediocre seasons. The Horned Frogs opened their season with a 3-0 loss to Texas Tech, but soon rebounded, beating Texas Southern 7-0. The Longhorns won their only game 2-1 against North Carolina State, but also beat Louisiana State by the same score in an exhibition game.

The USC women’s volleyball team looks to begin the year on a high note as it hosts the Luxe City Center Trojan Invitational at the Galen Center this weekend.
Jump start · Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter will once again prove to be a key component of the Women of Troy’s success this season. USC opens the season at the Galen Center. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan 
The No. 10 Women of Troy face a full slate of matches, as they play three games in two days. They will first take on Loyola Marymount on Friday night, before playing both Bucknell and Cal State Fullerton on Saturday at 10 a.m. and 7:30 p.m., respectively.
USC will compete against schools that the current squad has little experience playing. The Women of Troy have never faced Bucknell, have not squared off with Fullerton since 1989 and last played LMU in 2007. But that is not to say that USC’s historical success against these schools is lacking — USC has never lost to either Fullerton or LMU, holding an all-time record of 21-0 against the Titans and 7-0 against the Lions.
Nevertheless, the Women of Troy continue to work hard to prepare for all three non-conference opponents.
“We’ve been doing really good scrimmaging against ourselves, trying to just get better every day and every game and make sure we push through and go hard,” said junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter. “We’re a lot more competitive and complete, so we’re just very excited to see what we can do against different opponents.”
Despite the high expectations that remain for the Women of Troy, the team comes into 2010 looking much different than last year. One major change this season is the addition of six new freshmen — and so far the bevy of new talent has proven to be an added bonus for the Trojans.
“It did change the chemistry of the team, and right now it’s for the best,” Jupiter said. “We want to make sure that we can all compete together and really find that team bonding when we’re in trouble against opponents.”
Senior co-captain Geena Urango shared Jupiter’s praise for the team’s newcomers.
“They’re bringing tons of energy to the court,” Urango said. “I’m so happy to have them on the team.”
Even with a top-10 ranking and the No. 1 recruiting class in the country, the Women of Troy will still not have an easy time in the Pac-10. Seven of the conference’s 10 teams are entering the season with a top 25 ranking, making it that much more crucial for the Women of Troy to come away with wins early on in the season.
“It’s definitely important to do well,” Urango said. “That helps confidence-wise. Going into the Pac-10, you know it’s going to be a lot of tough matches, and winning at home is also very, very important.”
If the Women of Troy are able to come away with at least one win this weekend, they will help make history for coach Mick Haley. With 999 career victories in women’s collegiate volleyball, he is just one away from an impressive milestone — one his players would love to help him reach.
“That’s something that not many coaches have, so hopefully we get it for him,” Urango said.

Timothy Miller, an employee known for going out of his way to help students at the Annenberg School for School Communication & Journalism, died Saturday morning. He was 47.
Kindness · Miller often brought cookies, cakes and other food to celebrate holidays at Annenberg. - Courtesy of Annenberg Television News 
Miller, who lived in Lakewood, Calif., began working for Annenberg 12 years ago in the Facilities and Technology, Multimedia department. Miller moved into his office in the Annenberg equipment room eight years ago when he became the full-time equipment room coordinator.
“He was more than just a person who handed you the  equipment,” said Chuck Boyles, director of multimedia technologies at Annenberg. “[He] could tell you that he loved his job.”
Along with checking out a camera or tripod, students often received a piece of candy or a cookie from Miller.
“He was almost like a mother hen to everyone in this department,” said Boyles, who received several pineapple upside-down cakes from Miller over the years because Miller knew it was one of his favorite treats.
Miller frequently hosted food days and he would walk around the building, offering students and staff cookies, or bring in a crockpot and cook corn beef and cabbage on St. Patrick’s Day.
“He would always stop and greet everyone coming in the door,” said Fiona Siu, a senior majoring in architecture who worked in the equipment room.
Annenberg knew Miller for always being the first one to hand out Christmas cards and decorate the ground floor in bright holiday spirit, said Tom Norris, computer services consultant and Annenberg Television News supervisor.
Miller had been the same caring guy since college, said Norris, who attended Santa Ana College with Miller.
“He’s the kind of guy who never told you when his birthday was,” said Norris, who said he thinks Miller didn’t want other people to buy him presents. “All he ever wanted to do is help people.”
Though Miller did not share much about his personal life with co-workers, he essentially had three families — his immediate family, Annenberg and his church — Boyles said.
The Annenberg family will miss his smiling face, he said, but will also miss his dedication to his job and the equipment room.
“I think there’s a lot of stuff to pull together in the department,” said Lindsay Berg, a junior majoring in print journalism and sociology who has worked alongside Miller over the last two years. “There’s a lot of work to do now that he’s gone.”
Miller’s work ethic and long hours made him readily available and happy to help students.
“He always made the extra effort to reach out and help anyone but himself,” Berg said. “He was the life of the office.”
Miller treated everyone as a special person, Boyles wrote in a letter.
“Tim was unique, and while we are all unique, there will never be another Tim Miller,” he said.
Miller was working toward an undergraduate degree in communication during his time at Annenberg.
He was planning on walking at commencement this year, Norris said.
Miller is survived by his father, Paul Miller and mother, Ramona. A viewing will be held Friday from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Stricklin Snively Funerals and Cremations in Long Beach, Calif. The memorial service will take place Aug. 28, at 10 a.m. at the Westwood Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles.
Joe and Barbara Saltzman have established a fund that is now accepting donations in Miller’s name at The Jester and Pharley Phund.

Reverend Cotton Marcus is a song and dance man. The pulpit is his stage. The word of God is his act. The congregation is his audience. It’s his job to put on a show, and he does it well, never letting anyone in on the trick — until now.
Greater forces · The Last Exorcism introduces Reverend Marcus (Patrick Fabian), the man trying  to exorcise a demon from possessed teenager Nell Sweetzer (Ashley Bell) while her brother and father loon on. - Photo courtesy of Lionsgate 
This is the set up of The Last Exorcism. Struck by a crisis of conscious, Marcus has decided to allow a documentary film team behind-the-scenes access to his show and expose his sham. He is the man behind the curtain stepping onto the floor and declaring: “There is no Oz!”
Why this unprecedented step? Why this crisis of conscious? The answer lies in one word: exorcism. This is the reverend’s specialty. He has been performing them since the age of 10, ostensibly casting out demons and saving souls from the depths of hell. There’s only one problem: He has never encountered a demon.
Yes, it’s all fake. All a fraud. Marcus is a snake-oil salesman, a carpetbagger who preys on the gullible, the easily swayed, the fearful and the weak. He is the antithesis of a man of God. He is an exploiter of faith.
Until now he’s been able to rationalize his behavior. His is a victimless crime. He brings peace to the troubled — for a price. But exorcisms are on the rise, and they are becoming increasingly dangerous. A young boy recently died, and this is too much for Marcus. He knows exorcisms are fake and he will not allow people to die for this sham. Thus, he decides to make a documentary about what will be his last and final exorcism.
It is a wonderful premise, the kind from which classic horror films are made. It deals with the clash between the unbeliever and the supernatural, crisis of faith, man’s relationship with God. There is only one problem: The film does not live up to the idea that inspired it.
It is unfortunate, but The Last Exorcism’s glib irresponsibility undermines the sense of spirituality that should saturate such a film.
The problem begins with the decision to employ a documentary style, which at this point is a cheap and overused trick. Thematic lighting? Set design? Hollywood, you used to do it so well.
Documentary is, of course, employed to enhance realism, but why? The premise is theological, spiritual. Spirituality and reality exist on different planes. Why try to equate them?
As it stands, it feels like a cheap nod to the popularity of last year’s Paranormal Activity, but the two are very different films. Whereas Paranormal Activity is a horror romp, The Last Exorcism deals with a much more serious subject matter: a man’s soul.
Indeed, when watching the film you get the sense that the filmmakers were deliberately trying to avoid comparisons with that well-known horror flick, The Exorcist. This is understandable, but it is also a shame.
If The Last Exorcism had approached its subject with the same care as found in The Exorcist, it would have been a much better film, comparisons be damned. I’d much rather see a quality drama that pledges allegiance to a popular classic than a cheap knockoff that tries to capitalize upon a current fad.
Moving from the intellectual to the practical, enhanced realism grounds the audience’s imagination. One of the keys to the horror genre is creating a world where the audience believes that anything can happen. The goal is to make the audience run wild with anticipation — and then capitalize.
The Last Exorcism doesn’t do either. Rather, the documentary style merely results in a few shocks and cheap thrills, but nothing more. It fails to create suspense.
In many respects, the film is like Marcus himself, often too flippant and incapable of taking anything seriously. None of the characters besides Marcus are well-developed or unique. Instead they are cardboard cutouts lacking depth and originality.
The Sweetzer family (the subjects of the exorcism) are naught but a clan of ignorant country bumpkins who subscribe to every stereotype imaginable. They’re uneducated, stubborn, overly suspicious outsiders whose simple faith makes them appear to be backwards.
The filmmakers seem to peer down their noses at the Sweetzer family’s lifestyle with a sense of cool detachment. We are supposed to snicker at the fact that daughter Nell Sweetzer has been home-schooled for religious reasons and axiomatically believe that Louis Sweetzer’s has an incestuous relationship with his daughter. Indeed, it is borderline insulting.
Setting this aside, however, the performances in the film are surprisingly solid, especially for the horror genre. Patrick Fabian gives a quality turn as Marcus, perfectly embodying his fast-talking charm. He carries the film on his back. Ashley Bell, likewise, is solid as Nell Sweetzer. She’s hardly Linda Blair, but then again few are. The rest of the cast give concrete, workmen-like performances.
Ultimately, The Last Exorcism is undone by the fact that it cannot decide what it wants to be. Is it a campy summer horror flick, or is it something more – a work of drama? As such, it succeeds as neither, too shallow to be taken seriously, not fun enough to be enjoyable.

It seems almost ironic, sitting in the pristine USC School of Cinematic Arts at one of the nation’s top universities to watch a film propagating the devastating condition of New York City’s educational system.
Crossed fingers · The four families in the documentary await the results of the lottery for a chance to attend one of few charter schools. - Photos courtesy of Great Curve  
The Lottery, directed by Madeleine Sackler, was screened Wednesday evening by Outside the Box [Office] and will be available on DVD Tuesday. It documents the battle four families have to wage in order to gain what most students at USC might take for granted — the opportunity to get a decent education.
This film is not for the light-hearted. It’s an eye-opener, a slap in the face for any of us who might have skipped one too many classes.
Out of the 3,400 families who entered their children into a charter school’s lottery in Harlem, the film focuses on four — Ameenah, the spunky little girl who proudly translates for her deaf mother; Christian, the sensitive child who has not seen his mother for two years; Greg Jr., who visits his father in jail; and Eric Jr., the tiny break-dancer with a loving, involved family.
All four families live in the Harlem or Bronx, where 58 percent of fourth graders are “functionally illiterate.” It is not news that the United States is failing dismally with its public educational system, but the film draws emotion through the personal lives of these four young children.
The big event in the film is the wait for the lottery that will determine the 475 lucky children that will attend the Harlem Success Academy, one of the few charter schools in Harlem. That means six out of seven families that entered the lottery left disappointed, forced to settle for the drastically low-performing public schools in their district.
The attraction of charter schools is that — though they too are free of charge as part of a public school system — they are unfettered by the contracts of the teacher’s union and therefore able to focus more on the child’s performance rather than meeting a set of requirements. This also means that underperforming teachers can be fired, which is rare in non-charter schools because it costs $250,000 of taxpayer money to fire a teacher in New York public schools. Instead, charter schools are held accountable and must live up to their standards. When they fail to do so, they are closed down.
But the four families aren’t as interested in the fine details of the charter school system as they are in the positive results: The kids are actually learning. According to one Harlem Success Academy parent, his daughter who goes to charter school is teaching her older sibling who attends public school, how to read.
To these parents, this little accomplishment means more than the ability to read a whole sentence. It means that a whole new door of opportunities is being opened to their children — chances they never had, paths they were never shown and dreams they had never dared to dream.
“Nobody taught me which direction to go,” said Greg Jr.’s father, tearing up. “Nobody taught me the right thing to do.”
Instead, he turned to the neighborhood kids to teach him how to steal and sell drugs, landing him 25 years in a correctional facility. He fears that his own son could turn out like him.
In one chilling interview, a woman explains how one corporation used data on the number of failing black, male fourth graders to determine how many prison cells should be built by the time they graduated from high school.
Despite facing such statistics, Greg Jr.’s father hopes this trend of misdirection will stop with himself, and he pins all his hope on Harlem Success Academy to help his only so.
But many just as passionately disagree. In one particularly dramatic public forum discussing whether Harlem Success Academy should open another branch in place of a failing Harlem public school, insults start flying. Things get personal.
“You are not welcome here,” one mother snarled, holding her daughter’s hand. “You will come over my dead body!”
According to the documentary, the teacher’s union operates heavily behind this opposition, even funding other groups to stage protests on its behalf. It turns the children’s education into a political issue, strong-arming Democratic politicians into fostering negative impressions on charter schools.
The film does manage to show a few reasons behind these protests: There are claims that the charter schools are arrogant and disrespectful; the lottery is unfair and elitist; they are a dangerous privatization of education; they will disfranchise the community. But for the most part, the film largely neglects getting into the details behind the protestors, thus portraying a one-sided negative view of the opponents.
Instead, it gives more incentive to side with Eva Moskowitz, founder of Harlem Success Academy, who says these protesters are hugely misinformed. Charter schools are not here to conquer and overtake, she says. They are here to reform education.
As a mother and a resident of Harlem herself, Moskowitz understands all too well the pain of being mandated to send her children to the clearly incompetent schools within their zone, just because they do not have the financial capability to move to a better school district.
“The problem is not the parents. The problem is not the students,” Moskowitz said. “The problem is the system that protects academic failure.”
This, she said, was what spurred her decision to found Harlem Success Academy.
Of course, the subject of money is raised. Reforming an education system requires lots of funding. But the film provides several statistics that argue keeping low-performing schools is even more expensive. It costs the United States $500 billion per year to cover the achievement gap between low-income students and their higher-income peers. In addition, it takes $37,000 of taxpayer money per inmate, while costing $13,000 to educate a child in public schools, and even less in charter schools.
So are charter schools the answer? To Moskowitz, yes. She says they formulate a structure and teaching style that suits the students.
“Let’s put the focus on the children,” she said. “Not on the parents.”
Still, it is the parents who are most anxious as they wait for the lottery winners to be announced. Eyes are unblinking, wide open in search for their child’s name. Hands are clasped in prayer. Breath is held. The tension and anxiety are palpable and heartbreaking.
The Lottery does not just seek to wrench out a few tears. It is a subtle yet powerful cry for action, and it ends with four options for those who want to do a little more: “Mentor. Teach. Donate. Vote.”
Very thoughtful and well written review!
Loved this article! It’s so true that many of us take for granted the education that is offered to us. 
I’m not familiar with the education system in the United States, but no matter what system, public or chartered, I think the students should be the main focus. Meeting requirements can still be accomplished with keeping the needs of the students in mind. 
Very well written! You pointed out some great points in this documentary. Definitely made me feel ashamed to have skipped a couple classes during my school days.

Not all college students are created equal.
Some of us don’t drink. Some of us were exposed to alcohol before college and some of us weren’t. Most of us, regardless of what we might tell our parents, coaches, doctors or that aunt we like to borrow money from, have consumed alcohol more than a few times in our past. And some of the latter group have a history of substance abuse.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
In June, USC brought on board the AlcoholEdu for Sanctions program, in essence an alcohol awareness program that has been improved and tailored specifically to university students, especially those who have struggled with alcohol-related problems.
AlcoholEdu has garnered a reputation among some students as ineffective or a waste of time. According to a 2007 AlcoholEdu summary of key findings at USC, 54 percent of student drinkers felt they didn’t need to make any changes to their drinking habits after completing the course.
So at first glance, it might seem counterproductive to counsel students with negative drinking histories over the Internet. Don’t these students deserve personal interaction, not the equivalent of an online traffic court?
Time for a second glance.
USC’s Health Promotion and Prevention Services didn’t scrap the idea of counseling and outreach in favor of a standardized online course. What it did was divide the students referred to the department into two groups.
The first group consists of those who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in a room with both an open container of alcohol and a member of the Department of Public Safety. These are those wide-eyed students who can later be found earnestly explaining to their resident adviser, “Oh, see, I was just in a room hanging out with some people and my friends were drinking. I wasn’t.“ This group is the one sternly directed to the online AlcoholEdu for Sanctions course.
The second group, those who have in the past demonstrated harmful behavior or had negative experiences because of alcohol, are required to complete the course and still meet with a member of HPPS. HPPS, while not responsible for counseling them personally, helps them locate the appropriate resources, whether on or off campus, for therapy and learning how to make healthier decisions with alcohol in the future.
“Our goal is to increase protective behaviors while decreasing high-risk behaviors” said Paula Swinford, director of HPPS at the University Park Health Center. “We feel that AlcoholEdu for Sanctions really is the best choice for students at USC.”
AlcoholEdu for Sanctions has in reality done more than just institute new alcohol awareness courses and keep its one-on-one meetings going strong. The online aspect also standardizes the consequences for underage drinking among the “that’s not my cup” students. In the past, the severity of punishment for underage drinking was contingent upon whether the student was caught by an R.A. in the dorms, a DPS officer on The Row or a sanctions officer in a fraternity house. The advent of the new online course recognizes that those offenses are usually alike, and gives a consequence that is universal.
“It’s a fairer system now,” Swinford said.
In addition, HPPS is incorporating MentalHealthEdu and SexualAssaultEdu, both of which use data gathered from USC students in past years to tailor the courses specifically to our student body.
HPPS can’t say what percentage of sanctioned students will simply need the online course or will require additional resources. After all, the program is in its first year. What we do know is that the professionals involved are by no means giving up on personally meeting with sanctioned students — and that AlcoholEdu for Sanctions is a constructive step forward in the drive toward alcohol awareness.

In our culture, “tolerance” is a buzzword. Society has developed a hypersensitivity toward anything that could potentially be construed as discriminatory. The reasoning behind such a mind-set is sound; the American melting pot requires careful stirring to avoid boiling over. But implementing this anti-discrimination crusade is sometimes messy, and all too often misapplied.
The latest public display of this neuroticism is particularly relevant to students.
Every semester, we spend our first week recovering from the sticker shock of the textbooks we purchase for our classes. In an effort to curb costs, many universities have considered using electronic versions of textbooks that can be read either from a laptop or an e-reader. This upgrade has many benefits, not least of which is a price that won’t break the bank. Electronic books save hundreds of pages of paper and ink, do not require shipping,  and are portable — and thus more convenient.
Some, however, are not as eager to embrace e-books. In a recent letter to Case Western Reserve University, Pace University, Princeton University and Reed College, the U.S. Department of Justice said that the schools must “take steps to ensure that [they refrain] from requiring the use of any electronic book reader, or other similar technology, in a teaching or classroom environment as long as the device remains inaccessible to individuals who are blind or have low vision.”
The needs of blind people are important and universities must provide equivalent solutions, products and services to meet those needs, and if a university sees fit to provide e-readers to its students, it should accommodate the disabled by providing an equivalent product or service.
No government action should mandate that the unique needs of blind persons be met by the same devices that are optimized for use by those with normal vision, however. Printed textbooks do not have universal access features; nevertheless, they are a classroom staple. Blind and visually impaired students are provided with readers or other means of comprehending the textbook material, and these means can surely continue to be used, even with the introduction of e-readers.
Yet Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the civil rights division of the Department of Justice, maintains that “it is unacceptable for universities to use emerging technology without insisting that this technology be accessible to all students.” But most companies in the e-reader business have released or are in the process of releasing blind-compatible devices — the iPad among the first to do so.
A distinction must then be made between devices. Given that the iPad was already blind-accessible at the time of Perez’s letter, it could have been offered as a ready alternative.
On Aug. 5, the National Federation of the Blind released a statement commending Amazon on its recent announcement that the Kindle 3 will come equipped with a voice guide that reads all menu options aloud so blind and visually impaired people can navigate the device menus.
Recent technological advances will surely enhance the educational experiences for all students — but only if we take advantage of them.

I am not surprised to see the government abusing their authority, but I think it’s a moot point as the last time I investigated purchasing books on a Kindle, none of them were even available! Until the purse strings between the publishers and schools are broken, we will still have to fork over hundreds of dollars for books and future back surgery.
I’m with you in the sense that these devices have a lot of compatibility promise; my Kindle 2 (DX) ‘reads’ its books and newspapers with a digital voice, and the text can be blown up to an enormous size to accommodate those with impaired vision. It sounds like the DOJ jumped on this without looking into the current options on the market or in the near future.
I’m sure it’s not how you mean it, but be careful with the “just provide an equivalent service” argument. It smacks of ‘separate but equal.’

Facebook and Twitter have yet another privacy issue to worry about, thanks to a few bad Apples.
Users are being warned of an iPad scam that not only corrupts a user’s account, but also sends messages to that user’s friends and followers advertising free iPads.
“If you’ve received a message promising you a new iPad, not only is there no iPad, but also your friends have been hacked,” Twitter announced Wednesday.
Although the scam has not affected as many Facebook users as Twitter users, Simon Axten, a spokesman for Facebook, told Reuters in an e-mail that Facebook is still taking the threat seriously.
The scam message offering the free iPad typically includes a link to another website that is designed to obtain personal information from a user’s computer.
Mashable reported this morning that the message, on both Facebook and Twitter, usually resembles this: “u have to check out this website its glitchin right now and sending out ipads to everyone for free!”
While Facebook and Twitter work to stem the scams, users will have to be a little more careful, and figure out how to get a free iPad some other way.

While superhero comics are snatched up for the silver screen, it seems that independent horror comics are becoming treasures for the small screen. AMC’s adaptation of IDW Publishing’s The Walking Dead premieres on Halloween, and it was recently announced that another IDW series is being worked into a television series, as well: Locke & Key.
Created by writer Joe Hill and artist Gabriel Rodriguez, Locke & Key is a mix of H.P. Lovecraft-style horror and modern day gore films.
When their father is murdered, the three Locke children return to their family’s home in Lovecraft, Mass., to tend to the estate. Uncovering magical rooms and supernatural keys, the ongoing miniseries is both a character-driven piece exploring the siblings’ relationships with each other and a mystery surrounding the house and those trying to obtain the keys.
Steven Spielberg, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman are involved in bringing the project to television. Spielberg, of course, is the director of the Indiana Jones franchise and dozens of other movies, and a USC trustee. Orci and Kurtzman teamed up in 2008 to create the universe-spanning series Fringe, wrote the most recent Star Trek film and, along with Spielberg, produced the Transformers films and 2007’s Eagle Eye.
While Orci and Kurtzman’s past collaborations with Spielberg were often more special effects-driven than plot-focused, the source material of Locke & Key should lend itself to a textured adaptation. With the duo’s talent at putting a good show together, it just might work.
Who knows, maybe this trend will continue and we’ll see adaptations of Sword of Dracula or possibly B.P.R.D.
