In an effort to share safety information with students, the Department of Public Safety will help students engrave their names on personal property on Saturday.
The Adopt-a-Hall program, a building initiative that pairs DPS officers with USC residential buildings to enhance the department’s relationship with students, will offer students living in the Annenberg House, Regal Trojan, Founders and other apartment buildings north of campus — engraving services this weekend.
“We started the program four years ago to work more closely with students to help build a relationship and bring information such as safety tips or programs that may assist them to become more aware,” DPS Lt. Terry Goddard, who also serves as an Adopt-a-Hall coordinator, wrote in an e-mail.
Officers will be located in the Annenberg Apartment Lobby from noon to 6 p.m., where students will be able to engrave property for identification purposes and the continuation of crime prevention efforts, Goddard said.
Students can engrave their names on a wide range of property: laptops, DVD players, bikes, iPods, televisions and video game consoles. The engraving process is like writing with a pen, Goddard said, and should not take much time.
Adopt-a-Hall officers offer engraving services at the beginning of each semester, usually when students have the most new property, Goddard said.
Although the program could help students retrieve property that might be lost or stolen, Goddard said that since the program began four years ago, crime rates have remained steady.
“There have been no increase in crimes,” Goddard said. “This [initiative] is something we at DPS have done for years as an education and prevention program.”
Goddard said that DPS has been working more closely with students to help build a relationship and provide information such as safety tips and programs that might make them more aware.
“It’s nice to have that relationship,” said Ailie Birchfield, a resident adviser in Regal Trojan. “In a large school with 16,000 people, people are bound to have the same stuff and [engraving] is an easy way to distinguish personal belongings with each other.”
Many students said they think this program will be helpful in protecting their property, but because there is no tracking device that goes along with the engraving, finding lost property could still be difficult.
“It definitely is beneficial for students, but it’s hard to track something if it is stolen,” said Erica Hovsepian, an undecided sophomore. “If a name is on [student’s property] they can easily claim it, but there’s so much theft that it is hard to retrieve something once it is stolen.”
Jillanna Bassan, a junior majoring in gender studies, said the program was a good effort to assist students in recovering stolen property.
“It is a really good idea because I always hear about students having their things stolen from them and there should be some sort of system to help these students,” Bassan said. “This seems like a good way of improving it.”

One in four women will experience domestic violence during their lifetime, according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.
Standing up· The silhouettes placed by USC Men CARE, part of the Silent Witness program, hold facts and figures about domestic violence. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
USC Men CARE, a student organization and education program, is trying to lower this statistic by raising awareness on campus.
In honor of Domestic Violence month, USC Men CARE, which stands for Men Creating Attitudes for Rape-free Environments, put up silhouettes outlining the bodies of domestic violence victims and attached their stories to their shadows.
“We place them throughout campus to provide facts about domestic violence and educate students so they can get involved,” said Todd Henneman, program director for USC Men CARE and assistant director for the Center for Women and Men.
This project is part of the organization’s Silent Witness program that encourages students to report domestic violence anonymously.
“You will likely know someone who’s experiencing or will experience domestic violence and you could become a victim of domestic violence,” Henneman said.
Every year 15.5 million children witness domestic violence and many are negatively influenced by this experience, Henneman said. He also said that women ages 20 to 24 are at greatest risk of experiencing domestic violence.
“If it hasn’t been something you’ve dealt with in the past, it will be something you’ll have to deal with in the future,” said Cameron Sabol, president of USC Men CARE.
The program presents advice and offers strategies to students on how to maintain healthy relationships.
“We go around and give lectures on how to recognize red flags for sexual assault and domestic violence,” said Sabol, a senior majoring in physics and computer science astronautical engineering.
According to Henneman, the audience was surveyed before and after the lectures. The surveys were then given to the USC Rossier School of Education for analysis.
“The results show there were improvements of attitude; people were more likely to speak up,” Henneman said.
CarolAnn Peterson, an adjunct professor who teaches an undergraduate course on domestic violence in the USC School of Social Work, said she values people who acknowledge the serious issue of domestic violence.
“Whenever men get involved in an issue portrayed as a women issue it’s good,” Peterson said.  “It’s a community issue and it’s important to stand up.”
Peterson’s course educates students on how to determine what domestic violence looks like, understand why it occurs and identify who perpetrates it.
Henneman said domestic violence is often perceived as a man abusing a woman, when in reality most domestic violence occurs in some form of emotional abuse.
“It is important to understand different forms of domestic violence,” he said.  “An example is someone, a boyfriend or girlfriend, who wants all your free time and casts all others as a threat so it’s the two of you versus the world.”
Although Sabol said a very small portion of the male population perpetrates domestic violence, USC Men CARE promotes healthy masculine expression in its lectures and presentations.
“All-male groups like sports teams and frats invite us to speak,” Sabol said.
The program’s 12 members learn about sexual assault, gender roles and masculinity before lecturing.
“Sometimes there is pressure on college guys to prove their manhood through drinking, fighting … and the key is to speak up,” Henneman said.
Although most males want to resist bad influences and avoid getting into unhealthy situations, Henneman said most are afraid of being the first to object.
“After one guy calls the [perpetrator] out, the others usually speak up,” he said.
USC Men CARE began in 2005 and unlike most organizations, it has survived after its founding members graduated, Henneman said.
“Lots of other universities want to start something like this because it’s unique,” he said. “It’s a very eclectic, diverse group of guys.”
Why not stand up and raise awareness about victims, female and male victims of domestic violence?  Why is this division of genders needed to combat and end domestic violence when domestic violence can no longer be considered a gender based social problem?  Yes some men are still believe that they have a right to control, dominate and oppress women, however, those men are the exception rather than the “rule” today.
Why aren’t we encouraging college students to end domestic violence in all relationships?
If one victim is too many, then why is it that so many say, “women are the more prevalent and injured group so that’s the group of victims we focus on.”  If ONE VICTIM IS TOO MANY why limit our services and public awareness to combating just part of the problem?
Governor Schwarzenegger has to be commended making a very wise, sound decision in restoring funding for battered women shelters. Without a shelter for a battered woman to go to, she could be killed or severely beaten. This is a very important point that Governor Schwarzenegger recognized. Most men are bigger than women. This is a reverse decision for Governor Schwarzenegger and this decision shows that the Governor has a flexible mind to do what is right. Well done!  Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger!  You have saved the lives of many, battered women. If a husband has plans to kill his wife, beware, the “Terminator wil be Back.”

USC’s executive vice provost for academic affairs will leave USC at the end of this semester to become provost at Boston University.
End of an era · Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Jean Morrison will leave at the end of the semester to become provost at Boston University. - Photo courtesy of BU Now 
Jean Morrison will be the first female provost in the history of BU and will assume her position in January. She is also the first external hire for the provost position at the university in 30 years.
Morrison said she is looking forward to the new position.
“The opportunity to serve as provost under Boston University President Dr. Robert Brown is an extraordinary opportunity,” she said.
Morrison has worked at USC since 1988, when she joined the faculty as a full-time professor of earth sciences.
She has served on multiple National Science Foundation panels because of her research on the evolution of the earth’s crust, and has also led USC’s Women in Science and Engineering program since 2002.
Over the last few years, Morrison expanded her role at USC to include a number of administrative positions. She has served as vice provost for academic affairs and graduate programs, vice provost for graduate programs and associate dean in the graduate school.
Elizabeth Garrett, interim senior vice president for academic affairs and provost, said Morrison has made great contributions to USC’s graduate programs.
“She’s led our graduate programs for several years and was responsible for creating data portfolios for all of our Ph.D. candidates,” Garrett said.
In her current position as executive vice provost of academic affairs, Morrison oversees the Office of Undergraduate Programs, the USC Graduate School and the Office of Continuing Education and Summer Programs.
Garrett said Morrison has been extremely influential in creating excellent and innovative academic programming.
“Over the past several years, she’s played a real role in bringing schools together and moving forward in interdisciplinary relationships,” Garrett said.
Garrett said this new position at BU will be a great opportunity for Morrison.
Michael L. Jackson, vice president for student affairs, said Morrison will be missed by those who have worked with her.
“She has been a great friend, colleague and mentor to many of us at USC,” Jackson said in an e-mail. “Boston University is very lucky to have attracted such a capable, energetic and super smart person to become their next provost.”
Her successor at USC will be chosen by the provost at a later time, Garrett said. Information about potential candidates for this position has yet to be released .
In her new position, Morrison said she hopes to help Brown fulfill his agenda for the university.
“Boston University is a large research university that has ambitions to become an even stronger and more competitive university,” she said.
Though Morrison said she is excited about this new position, she said she is also sad to leave USC after 22 years.
“I love my colleagues here and will miss them,” she said. “It’s bittersweet.”
Is Professor Anderson leaving, too?

Students will gather in Alumni Park today to hear President Barack Obama speak at the “Moving American Forward” rally for senatorial candidate Sen. Barbara Boxer and gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown.
Boxer is currently locked in a tight race for California’s senate seat against Republican candidate Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, while Brown is facing off against Republican Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay.
The stop at USC is one of many for the president, who recently visited the University of Wisconsin and the University of Washington.
“The Democrats are trying dramatically to reconstitute the coalition that came out to vote in record numbers in 2008, and the youth vote was a significant part of that,” said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, an expert in state politics and a senior fellow at the School of Policy, Planning, and Development.
Politicians across the nation are visiting campuses to raise support for Democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm elections. Last week, former President Bill Clinton visited UCLA to raise votes for Brown and Gavin Newsom, the San Francisco mayor who is running for state lieutenant governor.
Boxer is leading Fiorina in the polls with an expected 51 percent voter support, according to a recent poll conducted by USC and the Los Angeles Times.
“This is the firewall. If Boxer goes, you can almost be firm that the Democrats will lose the senate,” Jeffe said. “This is a seat that should never get this close.”
Jeffe said the race between Brown and Whitman was trending more toward a Brown victory, but it’s too early to tell.
“Where Brown has made the most dramatic increase in support is among Latinos,” she said. “The question is whether that support turns into action in the polls.”
Brown leads Whitman with 49 percent support, according to the USC/LAT poll.
The purpose of Obama’s visit, Jeffe said, is to raise support for the election among Democratic voters.
“Republicans appear to be more enthusiastic. If that happens, the Democrats are going to lose significant races,” she said.
Micah Scheindlin, political director for the USC College Democrats, said he believed targeting college students is a smart move to get votes.
“The president and the White House know they come here and they are going to get thousands of college students,” Scheindlin said. “I think that everyone claims that is the issue — that Democrats need to energize their base, and nothing energizes them like a rally.”
Rally attendees can enter the event at 10 a.m. Obama will speak at 1:30 p.m. in Alumni Park. Actor and singer Jamie Foxx will perform.
Forrest for the trees; it’s not personal or political. 100 years of the Fed (1913), elite/government wealth confiscation, 40 years of reverse discrimination, hundreds of thousands good Americans dead (Minnesota, California, Texas, Kansas, Michigan) while limiting black combat exposure. Freedom is not free pupster, have fun tonight for tomorrow we will require your life/service.
Wow, first made boy Pat Haden turns Indymac Bank into the second largest fiasco in US history and then made boy Obama runs the united States of America into the ground. What are you boys going to do now? “We’re going to USC, and then Riordan’s Pantry for some chicken and waffles”. 
Wake up, smell the roses and Fight On.
Divisive? What is divisive is throwing around slurs about how Obama is a socialist. Just because our president isn’t as far to the right as you doesn’t make him a socialist.
The “public option” for healthcare wasn’t put forward because he wants a socialist state, it was put forward because a single-payer plan would never make it through Congress. I hate the healthcare reform bill (which has nothing to do with health CARE, everything to do with insurance) not because it goes too far, but that it didn’t go far enough.
There are flourishing medical industries in single-payer countries that I would dare you to call socialist — England and Australia for example. Sure, you may have to wait a bit for ELECTIVE procedures, but anyone who has needed care there has always gotten it without worry. THAT is a solution that works, not the state of affairs we have here, now.
Stop with the “socialist” hyperbole and the division will end.
What a fantastic opportunity to see a great president.  I have never seen such intense opposition to a sitting president.  This man has kept calm and focused despite, obstruction, racism, religious extremism and economic warfare.  He has managed to fulfill to 244 pledges and his policies stopped a cataclysmic collapse in the economy.  The students who see President Obama today are lucky.
Great President?  Please! He is far from great. He is one of the most divisive presidents ever and his low approval ratings bear this out.  It’s funny how one can disagree with any of the past presidents but one disagrees with this one and you are called racist.
This empty suit has done nothing but push a socialist agenda with his Obamacare and refusal to renew the tax rates.  He is tanking this country which will take years to recover.
Bart, you are the ONLY one that has made sense today.  As a Republican, I can still agree with you.  It took our Good Ol’ Boys 8 years to make a mess and they expect Obama to clean it up in less than 2.  Racism at its finest.
A businessman is drowning in the ocean.
　
Stimulus :   we should rescue him immediately.
　
Power first :  Nope !  How do we pay for it.  Just let him go under much like Lehman Brothers.
　
Stimulus :   He is dying right now.
　
Power first :  Nope !  You can’t save his money bag.
　
Stimulus ( clock is ticking ) : :   We can do everything.
　
Power first :  We are serious about jobs. Where are jobs ?  
Equation  :
Depression  :  New Deal  =   Great Recession  :  Stimulus Package (Groundwork)  + Incomplete  Energy Independence  or  A Jobs law
The Problem    =   The destructive war & military waste   +  Stimulus Package
Therefore     =   Incomplete  Energy Independence  or  A Jobs law   –  The destructive war & military waste
 Criticism     =   Stimulus Package (Groundwork)
 Conclusion     =   Gambling on Iraq Oil   +  weapon sell        Again       +  Double-dip  Depression 
 Cure     =   Slashing the destructive war & military waste        +     Completion of Energy Independence  or  A Jobs law
Anger at These       :
　
Gambling on Iraq Oil Again     :    A Drop in the  Bucket  Vs. Growing Population & Demand World-wide.  The Age of Cheap Oil  = A Thing of the Past.
　
1.      At this time, it looks like the oil-friendly country is gambling on Iraq oil again, citing a big government & deficit, and therefore the world-wide stimulus package worth trillions and health care reform in America are now at stake.
　
2.      Of the money by the money for the money is getting a society nowhere near prosperity.
Gambling on party of “no idea” is sure to be much like Throwing an Egg of Economy Against a Rock.
　
The outcome of government take-over     :
　
1.      In banking industry, the result of government take-over is big bonus parties backed by the tax-payer’s invaluable cash.
　
2.      In healcare reform, the outcome of government take-over is to dump ill children when needed most.
　
3.      In oil spill, the administration should be held responsible for its deregulation, urging a big government
　
Chanting deficit     :
　
1.      Amid chanting deficit, the same old failed policy.
　
2.      Amid chanting deficit, hands-off approach over huge trade deficit from oil money spill & trade imbalance with China from remorseless health care premium.
　
3.      Unfortunately, as a direct consequence of remorseless health care premium,  numerous folks have no choice but to hang onto affordable offerings,  since one in two households is said to face a hard decision between necessity  & drug.
　
4.      Inaction cost in relation to health care reform totals $9trillion over the next decade.
　
5.      Over the next 10 years, total Bush tax cut costs will equal $3.9 trillion, …. the tax cuts would increase deficits by nearly $4 trillion between 2005 and 2014.
　
The most critical debt     :    Personal Bankruptcy
　
1.      The current recession came from Personal Bankruptcy largely as a consequence of the relentless health care costs, pain at the pump, and the subsequent subprime mortgage crisis.
　
Facing huge trade deficit from oil money spill & trade imbalance with China, the primary economic policy of previous administration was ” spending baby “to the great delight of republicans’ sponsors.
　
2.      By comparison, the recovered stock market value alone, around $1.5 trillion, is nearly twice as much as the stimulus package, set aside all the other benefits.
　
As always, the republicans and unqualified media let folks locked in a box. ruling out the positive effects.
　
　
The most promising deficit-cut of government      :    Slashing the destructive war & military waste
　
1.      Slashing the destructive war & military waste alone supposedly could be enough to balance the budget.
　
　
Energy Independence     :    An Only Way to Desperately-Needed Job Growth
　
1.      My response to the question : where are jobs ?
In the trade deficit, exactly in the severe and persistent oil money spill,  taboo of ” do not add to the deficit” party.
　
2.      Under the existing Bush tax cut for lavish bonus parties, a sole job plan for the republicans,  the country already saw millions of job cuts.

Musicians using their fame to promote humanitarian causes is nothing new, but Flyleaf gave a passionate plea for people to rise up and help others at its concert at the House of Blues in Hollywood on Wednesday.
This fall, the alternative rock band has been traveling on its Unite & Fight Tour in hopes of not only putting on well-received shows but inspiring people to help others in need.
Along with supporting act Story of the Year, Flyleaf kicked off a text campaign to raise funds for the humanitarian organization World Vision and its mission to combat human trafficking.
In between songs at the band’s show, Flyleaf front woman Lacey Mosley spoke out against human trafficking and encouraged fans to donate $10 to fighting the trafficking rings, which according to World Vision, enslave 2 million children worldwide.
The victims caught in the trafficking rings are defenseless children, some as young as five. At that age, children should be in kindergarten, playing tag during recess, not being exploited by suspicious adults.
The tour’s aim is to help end the trafficking and it was definitely a focus of the show. But that did not mean it was a boring performance — quite the opposite.
Kicking off  the evening, Story of the Year proved that it hasn’t lost any of its spirit or humor in its 15 years of existence. With one guitarist in a cowboy hat, the bassist in a “Free Weezy” shirt and the drummer in a Los Angeles Lakers jersey, the opening act’s members have individual personalities and quirks. When it came to the music, however, they meshed together well on stage.
It was easy to see that the crowd was there to see them as well as the headliners, as concertgoers sang along with the band, yelling the lyrics of “Until the Day I Die” and “Anthem of Our Dying Day.”
When the main act did come on stage, it was not a letdown. Flyleaf exerted itself with raw energy and a powerful set of songs.
No one should be fooled by Mosley’s small stature, as she has a voice that can stop anyone in his tracks. Her vocal range was extremely broad and her growls send chills through the room with each lyric.
The rest of the band members — Sameer Bhattacharya (lead guitar), Jared Hartmann (rhythm guitar), Pat Seals (bass) and James Culpepper (drums) — put everything they had into their performance. They each moved to the pulse of the music, with eyes closed as they played through intense riff patterns and haunting chord progressions.
Seals, with his long hair and massive beard, commanded the audience’s attention as he set up at the front of the stage and whipped his hair around as he jammed on his bass.
The night was filled with an array of the band’s most popular songs, including “All Around Me,” “I’m So Sick,” “Cassie” and “Beautiful Bride” from its self-titled album as well as 2009’s Memento Mori.
In between the songs, Mosley talked to the audience about World Vision and the charity, urging them to help. For her, the group had a special place in her heart.
Mosley grew up in a household with a single mom and a total of six children, making it difficult for them to have even the most basic of necessities, she explained.
Coming to the rescue, World Vision provided them with clothes and shoes, even making a Christmas celebration possible.
Toward the end of the set, when the band members were preparing to play their new single “Arise,” Mosley stopped to say some touching words for the audience. She spoke about how she and the band were not any better than anyone else at the House of Blues that night because everyone was “created with a purpose” and should work to make the world a better place.
She challenged the concertgoers to be everything they were made to be and help others, because life is too short — a statement that echoed the themes on Memento Mori, the album’s title coming from the Latin phrase meaning “remember your mortality.”
As the night ended, it was clear that the bands have a strong dedication to charitable causes, and although the lyrics in Flyleaf’s songs reflect a life of hardship, they also show hope in a better future. Between a powerful show and calls to help those in need, the concert was anything but dour.

Ken Burns’ The Tenth Inning, the latest in his baseball documentary series, is a crashing bore, and the most that can be said on its behalf is that Stockholm syndrome sets in roughly halfway through.
For four hours, The Tenth Inning unfolds like a seemingly endless high school history lesson, covering the most scant basics of baseball’s  recent history from the beginning of the 1990s to the Boston Red Sox’s World Series win.
By the end, you begin to identify with the plethora of octogenarian sports writers who pontificate about the “finesse of the sport,” the importance of grit and heart, and the omniscient power of Cal Ripken.
The indomitable Keith Olbermann leads off for the wizened geezers by introducing the film with a statement on how baseball is great because it is essentially the same game as it was back at its creation in 1860.
Yes, Keith, modern baseball’s basically the same, except for the fact that pitchers now throw overhand, batters can’t tell them where to throw the ball, four balls make a walk, not eight, and foul balls are strikes. Oh, and the outfields now have fences too.
Yup, besides that, same game.
It is a dry recitation of the most basic facts about baseball over the last 20 years, a series of 10-minute episodes where the likes of George Will, Tom Boswell and Daniel Okrent opine about the 1998 home run chase, the start of the Yankee dynasty and the 1994 baseball strike.
These are not exactly obscure events. Everyone, fans and non-baseball fans alike, knows these stories and has most likely debated them ad nauseam. Do we really need a group of sports writers wringing their hands as they discuss how they and the owners covered up the steroid scandal for more than a decade? I hardly think so.
If you are going to cover events universally embedded within the social conscious, you’d better give me something new. Show how the popular conception is wrong, or take on an issue from a new and unique angle.
Look, for example, at what ESPN has been doing with its groundbreaking 30 for 30 documentary series. Specifically, look at Kirk Fraser’s documentary Without Bias about the life and tragic death of Len Bias, the University of Maryland star basketball player who died of a cocaine overdose the day after he was drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1986.
Unlike The Tenth Inning, Fraser’s documentary dives beneath the myth and looks at the man: what he meant to his family, his friends, his school and his sport, and how his life — and his death — has affected a generation of NBA stars and one of the league’s most storied franchises.
Fundamentally, The Tenth Inning represents all that is wrong with baseball and embodies the reason why the sport’s popularity lags so far behind that of football and why it is losing market shares to the NBA.
Both the documentary and subject fundamentally fail to realize that the market has changed.
It’s become younger and more dynamic, better informed. Statistical analysis in the form of Sabermetrics can now run circles around a sports writer’s gut. Fans tune in to watch mammoth home runs and blazing fastballs, not bunts and fundamental baseball.
We don’t want to hear about the love of the game and how history links generations, all the way from Babe Ruth to Albert Pujols. It doesn’t. We want to see a pro wrestling-sized freak mash the ball into geosynchronous orbit. We want to say “badass,” not “how profound.”
In all honesty, I do not know why this documentary was made. What is it supposed to achieve? All of the facts and stories presented in the four hours are common knowledge. Every fan knows them in minute detail. Tome upon tome has been written about them.
And if you don’t know? If you don’t know about the miracle that was the 2001 World Series or the tragedy that was the 1994 strike, are you really going to sit through a Burns documentary?
Ultimately, Burns produces a four-hour nostalgia trip, and if you want to take it, fine. But it’s a lazy piece of fluff reporting mired in the past, telling a story whose scribes are still mired in the belief that baseball is still the national pastime, Nielsen ratings be damned. As for me, leave me out. I’ve already taken my primer course on baseball history.

With a perpetually overcast sky and occasional sprinkling, it was undeniably a gloomy night in Hollywood — at least it started out that way.
Photo by Esther Kang | Daily Trojan
A modest number of people lined up outside The Music Box at Henry Fonda Theater on Hollywood Boulevard early Wednesday evening, waiting for the doors to open. The buzz of conversations resonated throughout the small crowd.
With Ra Ra Riot — the New York-based indie band that’s just on the cusp of graduating into the spotlight — as the night’s headliner, half of the crowd seemed to have no idea what to expect. The other half seemed to know exactly: an awesome, intense live show.
It wasn’t until 9 p.m. that the first opening band, Givers, stepped onto the dimly lit stage. The crowd on the floor was scattered and uncertain, with a passive curiosity pervading the theater.
But by the time the explosive five-member newcomer band from Louisiana finished its third tune, wild adrenaline pulsated in the air. The set was short, but ridiculously sweet — and sweaty. It was also eclectic, as the band’s repertoire of instruments included a ukulele, bells, tambourines, two drum sets, guitars and synth sounds.
With its spastic energy reverberating in the bones of every person present in the room, Givers breathed life — and pop — back into the crowd.
Following this set was Villagers, an acoustic-folk group hailing from Ireland. The band’s serene, crooning tunes contrasted with the bouncing energy expended just 15 minutes before in the very same spot, but it worked. The band, whose lead vocal was undeniably reminiscent of Coldplay’s Chris Martin, had the audience singing along by the end of its set.
By the time Ra Ra Riot finally stepped onto the stage a little past 11 p.m., The Music Box was exploding at the seams. The standing room that was half-empty just two hours before was now completely filled. There was also a newfound energy in the venue — a mix of uncontainable ecstasy and sensitivity, thanks to the two opening sets.
As soon as Ra Ra Riot strummed its first chords, the night reached a whole new peak. The band, complete with Wes Miles (vocals), Mathieu Santos (bass), Milo Bonacci (guitar), Gabriel Duquette (drums), Alexandra Lawn (cello) and Rebecca Zeller (violin), produced music with energetic pacing and poignant composition.
To zero in on a few standout talents, Lawn and Zeller immediately come to mind. The female representatives of the band and the ones who rocked the hardest on stage (and so gracefully at that), were key to the band’s refined sound Wednesday evening. They redefined what it means for classical music to meet rock. From their graceful, legato solos to fast, rhythmic notes, they came across as more innovative than those face-melting guitar shredders.
The band showcased an impenetrable chemistry on stage. Members fed off each other’s grooves, moods and solos, and were so musically connected, it seemed as if they were having an other-worldly conversation that no one else was privy to. It was a masterful show, where each band member seemed focused on the bigger picture rather than on solos, as some rock bands are prone to be.
By the fourth song, the entire audience was bouncing, grooving and singing along.
One of the many highlights of this set was when Lawn stepped away from the keyboard where she was singing backup harmonies. She walked over to the center of the stage and led the band in a slow rendition of “You And I Know.”
Her voice, which had the sweetness of Vanessa Carlton and the playful sultriness of Fiona Apple, beautifully washed over the hushed crowd.
After playing several hits from the band’s previous record The Rhumb Line, including “Can You Tell” and “Dying is Fine,” the audience was completely enchanted — singing, dancing and jumping without reservation. After less than an hour, however, it was over. The band bid the audience an almost-convincing adieu and left the stage.
After chants for an encore, the five band members were back in less than a minute, rocking their hearts out to “Massachusetts.” It was a clean and simple encore, eschewing showy theatrics to focus on music. No stories, no jokes, just music. There wasn’t any need for words.
Ra Ra Riot’s music spoke louder than a funny story or clever quip could ever manage.

Commissioner Larry Scott officially announced Thursday how the Pac-12 would be divided for the 2011 season, laying rest to weeks of speculation.
The decision hinged on the debate over how the conference would be split for the football season, as the 12-team group now warranted two separate divisions.
Scott said that there would be North and South divisions, news that, among other things, meant the California schools will be split up evenly.
The South Division will be composed of USC, UCLA, Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah — the last two being the new expansion teams in the conference. Stanford, California, Oregon, Oregon State, Washington and Washington State comprise the North Division.
The winner of each division will then play in the Pac-12 Championship game, which will take place in December on the home field of the school with the best conference record. Scott said Thursday that it was decided to pass up the potential revenue of playing the game at a large, neutral site stadium, saying it was more important to reward the fans and ensure a strong collegiate atmosphere.
“If you had told me a year ago that this conference would have expanded by two, that we’d have a championship football game, and have the level of commitment and support throughout this conference, and the level of optimism, I’d have been thrilled,” Scott said in the press conference.
The Trojans will be able to play these rivalry games every year, under a clause that locks both USC and UCLA into games against both Stanford and Cal, preserving the tradition of the historic California rivalries.
USC Athletic Director Pat Haden had previously expressed disappointment that the California schools could be split up into separate divisions, citing negative alumni reaction toward the split. He emphasized the need to play Stanford and Cal every year.
He said Thursday, however, that he was pleased with the announcement.
“At the end of the day, the presidents did a great job because they were able to preserve the rivalries — not only from USC’s perspective, as I understand it, but Oregon, Oregon State, Washington, Washington State and all those schools,” Haden said in a statement.
Each team will play five divisional games and four interdivisional games. The Oregon and Washington schools will play in Los Angeles every other year, instead of annually as they do now.
The issue of how often teams would play in California was among the most hotly contested debate among conference presidents and athletic directors. The idea of a “zipper” plan would have split up all rivalry schools into two divisions, meaning USC and UCLA would be separated, as well as Stanford and Cal, Oregon and Oregon State.
The agreement of equal television revenue sharing among all teams was unanimous, meaning all revenue made from television will be split equally between the 12 schools. However, if media revenue falls under $170 million in any given year, USC and UCLA will receive an extra $2 million each.
Scott called the unanimous decision for equal revenue sharing a harmonious and “very strong statement.”
“I am just really pleased with the way everyone came together and realized we’re building an enterprise that’s about to scale in a way these schools have never been part of,” Scott said.
Haden said he was also happy with the decision to share television revenue.
“The pie will get bigger,” he said. “Everybody’s going to benefit.”
The changes will be in effect starting next year, after Colorado was able to negotiate a deal securing an early release from its Big 12 Conference agreement.
There will be no divisions for any other sports. Men’s and women’s basketball will play 18 conference games, including home-and-homes against traditional rivals.

The bye week couldn’t have come at a better time for the Trojans.
Like father, like son · USC coach Lane Kiffin and his father, defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, have used the bye week to prepare for Oregon. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
Without the pressure of an impending game and the necessity to work out all the kinks by Saturday, the coaching staff can let players rest and recover from nagging injuries.
The entire starting offensive line, beside redshirt sophomore Matt Kalil, sat out or was limited during practice. Senior center Kristofer O’Dowd rested what he called a “strained shoulder.”
He was seen at the beginning of practice wearing a wrap around his shoulder, which was removed by the end of the practice session. He expressed no doubt he’d be ready for the game against Oregon on Oct. 30 and said he was expecting a Tuesday return. He called sitting out a preventative measure to ensure full health.
Junior tackle Tyron Smith sat out with an ankle injury, and senior guard Butch Lewis sat out with an undisclosed injury. Redshirt sophomore guard Khaled Holmes was limited and sat on a training table during the second half of practice.
“As we’ve said all along, hopefully we get these guys back by Monday, and be ready to go with a full week of practice,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin.
—
With all the injuries and the lack of depth on the team, the bye week functions as a training ground for the younger players to earn playing time and demonstrate to the coaching staff whether their talents can translate to the collegiate level.
The Trojans spent significant time in a four wide receiver set from the shotgun to simulate the style of play of the highly touted, high-scoring Oregon offense.
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley was hurrying the team to the line and coaches were emphasizing quickness and speed on both sides of the ball.
During a receivers and defensive backs drill, Kiffin told his players to ask themselves, “How am I going to tackle the fastest team in the country?”
It was a common line from the coaching staff during the moments when the team was working on full-speed drills, especially during the scrimmage at the end of practice.
—
Freshman running back D.J. Morgan got a number of carries during Thursday’s practice, even with the first-team offense.
He broke one of his carries for a touchdown and was picking up a number of yards on each attempt.
Kiffin praised Morgan on his ability and said that it was promising that the freshman was able to show off his skill set in practice.
“This is the first week that we’ve been able to see a lot with him,” Kiffin said. “He looks very explosive, even though he’s not 100 percent yet.”

The USC women’s volleyball team is No. 8 in the country, but in a very competitive Pac-10 conference, that ranking is only enough to put the team in a tie for third place. For a USC team with aspirations of winning a conference championship, its current situation must change in order to do so.
Bounce back · Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter, seen here returning a serve for USC, has starred for the tNo. 8 Women of Troy this season. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Fortunately for USC, an opportunity to move in the right direction presents itself this weekend. The Women of Troy play host to No. 16 Oregon, which is tied with USC in the conference standings, on Friday before facing off against Oregon State on Saturday. These matches mark the beginning of a four-game homestand for USC.
“I think it’s a tremendous opportunity for us,” said USC coach Mick Haley. “To be able to stay home and play is really good if we utilize it right.”
USC has gone 1-1 each of the last three weekends and is currently 4-3 in the Pac-10, but the Women of Troy are not allowing themselves to spend time doting on the past.
“You really don’t have time to cry about losses because you have to turn right around and prepare the next week for the next thing. What we’d like to do is start getting 2-0 wins,” Haley said.
Coming off last weekend’s 3-1 loss against Arizona State and comeback win against No. 25 Arizona, USC’s main focus in practice this week has been on improving.
“We’re continuing to work on our serve receive,” Haley said. “We’ve just looked at the numbers of the seven conference matches we’ve played, and they’re going up in the areas we’re practicing on, so that’s very good.”
In addition, USC is also focused on improving its blocking as well as cutting down on the number of unforced errors, an area that severely hurt the team against Arizona State.
“We’re still trying to figure out why we can’t get our left sides to reduce their [hitting errors], so until they figure this out, we’re going to have a little bit of a problem,” Haley said. “Once we start reducing errors on the left side attack, then I think we’ll be in most matches with a chance to win.”
But Haley knows that no victories come easy in the Pac-10, a conference that has seven ranked teams. He also did not downplay Oregon’s abilities, stressing the fact the team is very good at serving and doesn’t play like every other team.
“Oregon is kind of like the mad scientist,” he said. “They run a lot of different plays, come from a lot of different positions, show you a lot of stuff. Basically, we’ve just got to not panic.”
Haley also praised Oregon for being a very strong serving team, along with Oregon State. The play of both teams is also forcing USC to make some changes in its game plan.
“We have some special defensive work to do for these teams this weekend because they play differently, so we have to change our defenses a little bit to accommodate that,” Haley said.
Although the team has had to make adjustments to prepare for its upcoming opponents, Haley is confident USC can expose some of the other teams’ weaknesses.
“If we can continue to attack the middle effectively and get enough sets to the middle, attackers will cause the others teams — both of these teams — to spread out their defense more,” Haley said. “That would be good for us.”
Your need is for a left handed outside hitter which Stanford used to get many kills in their match here. A player similar to Lauren Killian who you did not recruit helping to win the two national titles.

Dear President Obama,
I know you’re a busy man. Leading our nation is no small task. With midterm elections, two wars and a struggling economy on your plate, you could be forgiven for not grabbing a copy of the Daily Trojan today.
But here’s guessing you’re the type of guy who picks up a newspaper and flips to the sports page first.
Your dedication to Chicago’s sports teams is admirable. Your skills on the basketball court are downright impressive for a man who spends most of his day in meetings and giving speeches. Your bracket picks for the NCAA basketball tournament each spring make national headlines.
So while you’re on campus, I thought I’d share a few of our sporting concerns with you.
First, about these sanctions: We understand that USC broke the rules. The idea, however, that USC during the mid 2000s was one rogue program operating outside of NCAA rules couldn’t be further from the truth.
Sports Illustrated’s revealing interview with college football agent Josh Luchs confirmed to many what they had already believed. USC’s violations aren’t the exception — they’re the rule.
Luchs told Sports Illustrated that he paid more than 30 college football players, many of them from UCLA, from 1990-1996. The list of schools implicated by Luchs features some of the nation’s top football programs: Tennessee, Ohio State, USC, Michigan State, Arizona, Washington State, Colorado, Illinois — even Portland State.
Since the NCAA handed down USC’s scholarship reductions and two-year bowl ban in June, investigations have been opened into potential violations at North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Alabama and Georgia.
North Carolina’s alleged violations involve at least 13 players. To me at least, that appears to be more of a lack of institutional control than what USC was punished for, which involved only Reggie Bush and O.J. Mayo.
Will the NCAA really punish all of these schools as harshly as they did USC?
It seems unlikely that every program whose players accepted money from agents in the last 20 years will be investigated and sanctioned. Even those violations that occurred within the last five years (the NCAA’s statute of limitations) are too numerous to be completely documented and punished.
Wouldn’t the NCAA’s time be better served formulating a solution to the problem of agents paying players than investigating every program in the country?
So, Mr. President, in the interest of fairness, I humbly submit a request.
In light of recent news about how many programs are affected by these types of violations, USC’s punishment seems a bit harsh.
Luckily, the Constitution of the United States allows for you to help restore justice.
Perhaps a presidential pardon is in order for USC football?
Secondly, let’s discuss the Bowl Championship Series. Although we’re not too concerned about strength of schedule formulas and Harris Poll votes this season (see the sanctions mentioned above), it’s been a problem for USC in the past.
A loss or two against inferior opponents kept the Trojans from playing for the national title in three straight seasons.
In 2006, it was Oregon State and UCLA. In 2007, Stanford and Oregon played spoiler to the Trojans’ national title dreams. Oregon State then pulled the upset again in 2008.
You said it yourself before Florida and Oklahoma played in the BCS National Championship Game in January of 2009: “If I’m Utah, or if I’m USC, or if I’m Texas, I may still have some quibbles. That’s why we need a playoff.”
The concerns that a playoff would diminish the excitement of the regular season are valid. Watching top-ranked Alabama and Ohio State lose in recent weeks made for top-notch drama.
The chance to see the country’s eight best teams square off in a three-week, single elimination tournament, however, would make for must-see TV.
The change would surely benefit a USC program that seems to perform the best when the stage is the biggest.
You might be thinking that these requests are pretty selfish of us. It’s true: With the sanctions lifted and a playoff system in place, the Trojans’ chances of winning another national title in the years ahead — and paying you an honorary visit in the White House — would be much improved.
Thanks for visiting our home. In a few years and with a little help from you, our football team could be making a return trip to yours.
“Sellin’ the Sizzle” runs every other Friday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Jonathan at jkendric@usc.edu.
Thank you for writing this important article. Our president needs to focus on the POSSIBLE that affects Americans. The BCS is a fraud. The President needs to drop the BP ultimatum – create a national playoff system or face sanctions!
It’s easy to see that you’re a student, not a recent graduate.  If you were the latter, you’d use your “wish” to ask Obama to propose and push a jobs creation program.
Enjoy your time in the cocoon.  Reality will bite you soon.

By its own standards, USC is reeling.
Big help · Junior goalkeeper Joel Dennerley has tallied 107 saves for USC this season, but the team has struggled recently, losing two in a row. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
For the first time since 2007 the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (15-2, 1-2) has lost consecutive conference games and now appears more than just beatable.
“I think we have gone away from our fundamentals,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “We are thinking ahead and we are not doing what we’ve done well all season.”
But a Sunday showdown with No. 6 UC Santa Barbara might provide the Trojans with an opportunity to address a majority of the issues plaguing the youthful bunch.
“I think we are going to have a good game,” Vavic said. “We had a good week of training so far, and I feel good about the way the guys practiced. They were in the meeting room and really did a good job of listening.”
In spite of Vavic’s optimism, however, recent results have exposed many of the problems threatening the previously undefeated Trojans’ hopes of swiftly navigating the regular season and earning yet another NCAA title at the year’s conclusion.
Against Stanford, the team was hampered by poor shooting and an inopportune offense — except for freshmen two-meter Jeremy Davie and driver Nikola Vavic, who combined for three goals, the team was held scoreless.
“When you are passing and shooting, it’s all about the execution and fundamental skills,” Jovan Vavic said. “We have rushed passes, and we have rushed shots. So we just have to relax, focus and do the little things.”
A week later, a matchup with Mountain Pacific Sports Federation rival California marked improvement on the offensive end, but defensive miscues prevented Vavic’s bunch from putting themselves in a position to win, as the Trojans trailed 5-0 early in the first period.
“We made so many defensive errors,” Vavic said. “It’s really very frustrating because we are a better team than that. But the teams are figuring us out. They’re developing gameplans to stop us and we have to become much more defensively aware.”
As anticipated for a group that lost nine seniors from the back-to-back championship team of 2009, youth has become a serious issue.
“The biggest thing is that our starting unit has Davie, [Stephen] Siri, Nikola [Vavic], and Tobias [Preuss] — all four new players. All freshmen,” Vavic said. “And well, they’re making mistakes. I think in the beginning of the season we did not make those mistakes.”
In Sunday’s contest against the No. 6 Gauchos, the Trojans won’t be afforded many second chances, as UC Santa Barbara holds one of the toughest defensive units in the nation, featuring goalkeeper Myles Christian, who allows just 6.7 goals per game.
“Santa Barbara, in my opinion, is one of the best teams in the country,” Vavic said. “They’re strong and have very good kids. They are right behind us in terms of team defense this year.”
And based on previous results, the Trojans know how challenging an opportunity the Gauchos will be.
Earlier this month, the Trojans faced UC Santa Barbara in the semifinals of the SoCal Tournament, and after a strong opening frame, built a 4-0 lead before watching it crumble after five unanswered goals from the Gauchos. Eventually, a 7-6 win was secured by the Trojans but strong play on behalf of UC Santa Barbara certainly left an impression.
“They played well,” Vavic said. “They have quite a few experienced foreign players and are really tough.”
But that hasn’t halted any sort of optimism heading into Sunday’s contest.
“They do have good shooters and are a good team overall, but I feel much more confidence this week than I did last week,” Vavic said.

Podcast: Assistant sports editor Kenny Legan chats with USC women’s soccer player Ashley Freyer to preview the upcoming match.
It’s a perfect Hollywood script with enough drama to fill a blockbuster — and one more chapter will be added tonight to this historic rivalry between USC and UCLA.
Early boost · Freshman defender Mia Bruno, who has seen significant playing time in her first season with USC, has helped the Women of Troy to an 8-4-3 record thus far. USC will play its second match of the season in the Coliseum tonight against UCLA. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The women’s soccer teams will go toe-to-toe beneath the bright lights of the Coliseum in a crucial conference showdown at 7 p.m.
“I get up for these games against UCLA,” said senior defender Karter Haug. “I just love playing in these types of games, and to play in the Coliseum is one of the best opportunities.”
This key matchup between the No. 23 Women of Troy (8-4-3, 1-2-1) and the No. 19 UCLA Bruins (9-5-1, 2-2) will be magnified not only because of the rivalry but because USC also hopes to bring in a record-breaking crowd.
The last time the two teams squared off at the Coliseum, a crowd of 7,804 showed up to witness this classic rivalry.
This time, the Women of Troy hope to break that record and also put an end to UCLA’s three-game winning streak against USC.
“It’s a real big game for both teams as far as our position in the Pac-10, and obviously the rivalry is huge,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “Both teams will be fired up and we’ll be able to play in the Coliseum, so it’s fantastic. It’s what you work for all year … to showcase yourself in front of your home crowd.”
Though UCLA has come out victorious in the last three meetings, the last time the Women of Troy won marked a special moment in Trojan history.
The Women of Troy knocked off UCLA 2-1 in the NCAA semifinals en route to winning the 2007 NCAA championship.
Haug, along with senior forward/midfielder Megan Ohai, senior midfielder Alyssa Dávila and redshirt junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval, were all part of that championship team.
But last weekend in Oregon proved to be a wake-up call for the Women of Troy, as they were plagued by slow starts and inconsistent play and finished the weekend with a loss and a tie.
Despite their recent struggles, Haug believes the team will be prepared.
“I think we’ve learned from our experience and we can look back at how we played and hopefully not do the same things,” Haug said. “But hopefully, we’re progressing each game as well.”
Freshman midfielder Haley Boysen knows the importance of this game and said she believes the team will be ready to redeem themselves.
“Last weekend was a disappointment and we realized we can’t let that happen again,” she said.  “We’re better than that. … We’re pumped up for this game and ready to make up for what happened.”
But despite all the hype surrounding the rivalry and the record-breaking attendance aspirations, Khosroshahin said this game is the perfect opportunity for his team to learn and grow.
“We’re just trying to improve the parts of our game that will help us the rest of the season and hopefully in the tournament as well,” he said. “We just have to do the right things at the right times and we’ll be fine.”

For the first time since Ronald Reagan’s 1984 visit to the Coliseum for the Opening Ceremonies of the Summer Olympics, a sitting president is visiting the USC campus.
President Barack Obama’s rally today has been hotly anticipated since rumors of his presence began spreading two weeks ago. Campus is swarming with lighting crews, Secret Service agents and tens of thousands of students, faculty and visitors eager to hear Obama speak.
The event has generated so much chaos and publicity that many students were left wondering whether it would be worth the trouble to arrive at 6 a.m. for the chance of being within earshot of the president’s speech.
Obama came to USC as part of a college tour to address our student body and drum up support for California Democrats. Central to his tour’s purpose is rallying the youth vote in time for November’s election. He is speaking to the community and he is speaking to his constituents, but ultimately, he is speaking to students. Therefore, students should have been granted entrance to the rally before non-USC affiliated visitors.
Coordination between university administrators and the Democratic National Committee should have kept USC students in mind. For example, USC could have proposed a system in which students with a USC ID were allowed access to a student section at the front of Alumni Park.
The chance to be present at a sitting president’s speech is a unique opportunity. For students to hear Obama speak at their own university is all the more remarkable.
Unfortunately, even though students are the target demographic of the campaign that brought Obama to USC, this was not an event that was catered to them. It is disappointing that the USC administration could not have structured the rally in a way that made it more realistic for the highest possible number of USC students to attend.
The next time a world-renowned speaker comes to our school to address us, we should not be lost in the shuffle. Hopefully, the USC student body has the passion and tenacity to not be deterred by long lines and heavy traffic.
I understand the frustrations, but I’m going to have to disagree. I’m glad it was open to the community and I think the University made the right move by having students in the same section as community members. With little notice and during the time of the Inauguration of Nikias, the administration did a pretty good job on educating students about the event. They sent out an email, they contacted PSA which brought about even more information… Yeah, it would’ve been nice to sit closer to the front, but I should’ve volunteered or showed up earlier to get those good seats.
What a stupid article. It is people like you, unnamed author, who give USC students a bad name. Do everyone a favor and stop writing.
I go here and even I think this is idiotic. Seriously? I think they addressed the university enough. As this was basically a Democratic Party rally that happened to be at USC, no one even needed to acknowledge the university, and yet I can’t even count the number of times I heard a speaker say something to the tune of “Fight On.” It was enough that the student speaker basically bypassed all serious discussion of political issues and talked about how great we are. It’s stuff like this — along with the fact that people complained about Sample speaking at the 2010 graduation — that makes me embarrassed to identify myself as a Trojan. There is a world out there, y’all.
Why is a student’s schedule more important than any other American citizen’s?  He is the President of the United States, not the President of USC.  If you don’t appreciate his visit enough to invest some time, then so be it, but you are not entitled preferential treatment.  I took the day off work, left home at 7:00 AM, got in line at 8:00 AM, and stood approximately 75 yards from the President.  My sacrifice was well worth it. There were many, many, USC students around me, which was quite obvious when they raised their fingers in a V.  Clearly, they valued this rare experience.  You’re right, “this was not an event that was catered to them” (the student), nor should it have been.  The President’s visit was intended to be inclusive for all Americans.  For the record, I am an alumnus who also saw President Ford when he visited USC in 1976.
I don’t think any of you guys understand what you are talking about. So THINK for a moment and stop sniffling like you go to the University of Spoiled Children.  
This was not a state presidential visit. This was a PARTISAN campaign event.  I have no problem with that as I am an Obama supporter. But a private, or public, university cannot by any stretch of the imagination male any special, privileged, arrangement for its students or staff to attend an even organized by the DNC as part of an election campaign.  It’s about that simple. Or do I have to explain it again?
Poor babies are worried they might have to miss a class or actually stand in line with all those normal, regular people from the community. Geez, you’re lucky the community doesn’t gang up on you and turn USC into a much needed vegetable patch.
I completely agree with this author!  Considering the typical student’s academic responsibilities, it simply was not realistic for most students to get in line at 7:00am for an event that wouldn’t be over until well after 3:00pm.  I got in line at about 8:30am and was amazed how many people from the community (with hardly any students or faculty) were in front of me already.  I realize that the community is a huge demographic (much larger than the USC student body certainly), but it seems that if they want to use our campus and affect our students with all the set up / later security concerns, they might have gone to a little more trouble to see that USC students got some of the benefits.  A small student section whereby to enter you needed a valid USC student ID might have been nice.  Heck, even a general college student section where you needed some valid student ID at an area college would have been good.
Who writes this drivel? If students were interested enough in seeing the President they would have simply shown up and would have needed a “preference.” Good heavens, they could even cut class.  Looks like the reporters at your paper didn’t go either because I don’t see any real coverage of the rally here.
By the way, students in different historical periods have made much greater sacrifices for important political causes than just standing in line. You sound like spoiled brats.
This is idiotic. He did not come to address college students exclusively or as a guest of the university. The DNC rented out the area, and it was their right to do what they felt would have the greatest impact on achieving their goal of electing more Democrats. Tragically, USC students do not represent a significant part of the voting population. The USC administration did not structure the rally, and it was not their position to do so. And grow up; if you don’t want to be “lost in the shuffle,” then don’t allow yourself to be so.
Ron Paul: The real voice for change.
Since you feel like you missed out on something, I’ll sum up his speech for you.  “Hope for Change.”

Before I talk about the rivalry between Northern and Southern California, I have a confession to make:
I’m biased. Disgustingly biased.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Usually, I perpetuate the war as if I get paid to do it. I love the NorCal fog. I often describe Los Angeles as a dystopian desert. At USC, I say “hella” more than I ever did in the Bay, just to keep things especially obnoxious.
But a weekend trip to the Treasure Island Music Festival in Northern California got me thinking. I looked at the crowd. Sure, we were all wearing parkas — but take that away and none of us would have seemed out of place in Southern California.
Neon leggings, loose tank tops, unnecessary sunglasses — it’s the kind of attire that is frequently seen around campus.
The geography and landscape of the regions will always be different, and Northern California will always be more granola than glitter, but I’m willing to bet that no one outside of the West Coast sees that big of a difference.
At the end of the day, most Californians can admit that NorCal and SoCal aren’t so fundamentally different. Their disparities are vastly overshadowed by the defining factors the regions share.
Blasphemy, you say? Hear me out.
First, both sides are dominated by fickle, high-profile industries that consistently make the news.
For Los Angeles, it’s Hollywood. Moviegoers across the globe speculate about the next big films coming out of Los Angeles, not to mention the careers and personal lives of actors. It’s something of a spectator sport.
In many respects, NorCal has its own version: Silicon Valley. It’s hard to open a newspaper without reading about something that’s getting digitalized. The cults of personality surrounding Bill Gates and Steve Jobs could rival those of A-listers.
Great programmers are often as quirky as great actors — something David Fincher’s The Social Network aptly demonstrated. If the movie wins an Oscar, don’t be surprised to see a blockbuster about Apple.
Second, neither side likes to follow tradition. The United States might have been founded by Puritans, but in most of California, you can swear like a sailor and buy liquor at a pharmacy.
These behaviors might not be acceptable in much of the East, the Midwest and even some of the actual West (Utah, anyone?)
What’s more, in California, alternative views and trends aren’t relegated to insular subcultures.
In Northern California, environmentalism isn’t just for hippies; in Southern California, ripped shirts and unlaced boots aren’t just for punks. The big cities in the Pacific Northwest do have similar nontraditional vibes, but California is loud and proud about it — the entire state is famous for marching to the beat of its own drum, which would probably be a bongo.
Perhaps this trait is mainly apparent in the metropolitan regions, but many of the surrounding towns follow suit too.
Finally, people on both sides dream big. Thousands of migrants come to California — north and south — with the specific intention of making it big, whether that means producing a movie or creating a popular social media tool.
Dreamers are readily apparent in California’s political arena, too. Berkeley and San Francisco’s activists come to mind, but consider the fact that it was our Republican movie star governor who said that California should lead the way in green energy.
Then, there’s same-sex marriage. It’s an issue all over the nation, but Californians will probably be the ones who bring it to the Supreme Court.
And what if California becomes the first state to legalize marijuana? The issue is still polarizing, but hardly because of a north-south divide.
The point is that all Californians live with the awareness of infinite possibilities — a  factor that influences state culture more than any regional disparities.
Being from Palo Alto, Calif., I sometimes joke that I’m an out-of-stater. I still think it’s strange that people in Rhode Island drive three hours to go to college in Massachusetts, yet I have to drive six hours to go to school in my own state.
California is vast, but it retains a distinctive feel, one that stands tall against regional differences. Texans just say they’re Texans. From now on, I’m going to say that I’m just a Californian.
But I’m still going to say “hella.”

A Michigan teenager’s death is the most recent in a string of suicides by gay teens who were bullied by their peers.
Corey Jackson, a 19-year-old sophomore at Michigan’s Oakland University, committed suicide on Tuesday.
His family believes that Jackson, who had recently come out to friends and family, was bullied for his sexual orientation and that the harassment led him to take his own life.
“He said, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong. Ever since I came out people are treating me different. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where I belong,” said Kim Jones, Jackson’s aunt, to WDIV.
Oakland University Student Legislator Darrell Boyd told WDIV that the campus was very tolerant overall.
“Oakland’s an accepting school and we’re pretty broad and diverse so it’s pretty shocking something like that would happen here,” Boyd said.

When Mrs. Potts sings, “Tale as old as time, true as it can be,” in Beauty and the Beast, little did she know that one tale wouldn’t be true at all.
A version of the Oscar-winning Disney classic has been recreated almost shot-for-shot by GM Toons, a Thai moviemaking company. Internet searches for GM Toons and Erawan Entertainment — the two companies mentioned in the trailer — turn up no results, however.
The Thai version copies the original almost shot-for-shot with choppy computer animation. It also features some differences in character appearance. The Beast bears a striking resemblance to the adult Simba in Disney’s The Lion King — if Simba donned some rather unfortunate-looking striped horns.  And Lumiere, the beloved source of comic commentary, is downgraded to a candlestick rather than a candelabra.
Viewers of the Thai trailer, if offended by this blow to the entertainment of their youth, can find original Beauty and the Beast animation stills here.
“True as it can be,” indeed.

Last Friday, thousands of members of the Trojan Family woke up bright and early to celebrate the installation of President C.L. Max Nikias, the 11th president of the University of Southern California.
Throughout the week, campus was abuzz with excitement in anticipation of the historic undertaking, with the rapidly multiplying rows of white chairs helping to illustrate the scope of the event.
Among the notable attendees were Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Former Vice Chancellor of Oxford UniversityJohn Hood and Nikias’ predecessor, President Emeritus Steven B. Sample.
Despite the overcast skies, the inauguration was a lively affair, with those in the crowd treated to a ceremony that featured fireworks, a specially commissioned quartet performance and a powerful speech from the university’s new leader.
All things considered, we want to know:
What was the most memorable part of the Inauguration of President C.L. Max Nikias?
