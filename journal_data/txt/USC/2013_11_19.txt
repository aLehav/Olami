When asked about the trauma of 9/11 and the experience of being a leader during wartime, the nation’s 43rd president couldn’t resist a stab at humor.

“I thought this was gonna be like, ‘What is your favorite color?’” he joked of his expectations for the evening.
Moderator James Ellis, dean of the Marshall School of Business, was quick to reply: “That might be what they do at Yale, Mr. President, but not here.”
C. L. Max Nikias and the University of Southern California welcomed former President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush to Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday evening for the annual President’s Distinguished Lecture. The nation’s 43rd president and first lady talked about life during and after the presidency, and the legacy they have worked to establish since leaving the White House, to a crowd that included students, donors and trustees of the university.
The event brought a more personal perspective to a family many USC students had only seen on television and in the public eye.
“I think we have a view of the president as someone who is supposed to be perfect in every form and never mess up,” said Katya Sutil, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering. “The talk brought students a humanizing perspective on leadership.”
Bush began the talk by describing the feelings he had about remaining in public life at the end of his presidency.
“I was tired of it and wanted to get away from it,” he said. “One of the sacrifices you make as president is that you give up anonymity.”
The Bushes concluded that they wanted to remain engaged in policy but disengaged from politics. Together, they discussed programs they have pioneered such as the Women’s Fellowship Program, which most recently brought a group of Egyptian women to the United States to network with national leaders and gain resources to help them succeed in their home country.
On the issue of leadership, Bush shared two of the principles upon which he shaped his administration: to hire trusted advisers, and to make decisions and act on them. He discussed this in the context of the 2008 recession, when then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told him that the $750 billion stimulus package would be most effective if given directly to Wall Street.
Bush became most passionate when discussing the days following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
“The nature of the presidency is uncertainty,” he said. “I had become a wartime president — no one had asked me in any of the debates or fundraisers or discussions before I was elected, ‘What are you going to do as president in a war time?’”
Paul Jung, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the discussion changed how he viewed Bush’s presidency.
“The things he was talking about made me sympathize more with what he was going through personally and experiencing, versus what we were experiencing on our side,” Jung said.
The Bushes were able to combine a discussion of the presidency’s most serious moments with recollections of some of the presidency’s most humorous moments. When then-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi came to the White House, Bush recalled the most powerful man in Japan’s request to go to Graceland.
“We fired up Air Force One and went to Memphis,” he said. “As we were leaving a barbecue restaurant, [Koizumi] got up and sang ‘Love Me Tender’ with an Elvis impersonator!”
Bush also offered commentary on other world leaders, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“Putin is basically anti-American at his core and believes that the demise of the Soviet was bad for the world,” Bush said.
Bush interspersed advice to students throughout the event, including the discussion of his recently realized talent for oil painting. After leading the United States for eight years, the Yale graduate and Harvard Business School alumnus said he didn’t know it all.
“Just remember, you’re never too old to learn something,” he said.
 
A typical inane remark by Bush regarding the wars after 9 – 11. Thinks it is humorous leading thousands of
soldiers to their demise to somehow honor his father for getting out of the mideast during his term.
Well I guess the Presidency of George W. Bush can be helping in teaching students exactly what not to do as President. Did USC pay to get him here? Surely we could have spent the money on someone more interesting and deserving.

Right now, the Ed Orgeron bandwagon is barreling up and down I-110 at breakneck speeds, gaining momentum at every turn. A win over Stanford, the No. 4 team in the nation and an opponent USC hadn’t beaten in the last four tries, warrants such a swell of support from fans and players.
Not so fast · Interim head coach Ed Orgeron has incredibly turned USC’s season around, but he is not the best choice to permanently lead the team. — Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Pat Haden can’t be nearsighted now. Not after the Kiffin saga. Orgeron should not have the interim tag lifted, no matter what the result against UCLA is in two weeks. He has somehow turned the media’s attention back toward USC, but if he becomes permanent head coach, then USC will win as many national titles as it has won since Matt Leinart and [redacted] left Troy.
Coach O is winning thanks to scrappy plays and a positive attitude. He has been not just backtracking, but sprinting in the opposite direction from the ways of Kiffin.
“The whole team has picked up more physicality and become tougher,” redshirt junior defensive end George Uko said after Saturday’s win.
The problem with his strategy is that perennial national title contenders don’t win titles through scrappiness or discipline; they win them by dominance.
Alabama has won two straight titles by going out every week ready to throttle their opponent. The same goes for Oregon, which performs at such a high level that each loss makes headlines across the nation. Even if the Ducks are title-less, they’ve established themselves as a team to be feared. Another team on the list: the 2005 USC team that averaged just shy of 50 points per game.
USC needs a head coach that has the offensive pedigree to help the Trojans steamroll their opponents. The Trojans want scores like 62-28 over Cal rather than 19-3 over Utah. Even though USC allowed 483 yards (albeit some in garbage time) in Berkeley, the excitement and perceived dominance was miles ahead of the win over Utah, where an exceptional USC defensive performance was mostly overlooked because of the offense’s less than stellar play. Injuries have drastically impacted USC’s offense this year, which means the read on offensive coordinator Clay Helton as the playcaller is still unclear.
Under Orgeron, USC would probably win nine to 10 games per season consistently. USC’s recruiting appeal, combined with soon-to-be-lifted sanctions, will allow the Trojans to reel in elite talent from across the country, and talent wins out more often than not in college football.
Orgeron, however, is not the kind of coach to lead teams to undefeated or one-loss seasons year in and year out, which is the unwritten expectation at this program. He motivates well, but bringing in different speakers and meals every week doesn’t lead to real results. Orgeron’s players love him and have admitted to playing harder because of it, but being the program leader at a school like USC requires much more than locker room rah-rah.
Orgeron has been put in a unique situation as the interim head coach. Kiffin was the nasty ex-boyfriend, and Orgeron is the rebound relationship. The first few dates have gone well, with Stanford being the best one yet, but that doesn’t mean it’s time to tie the knot.
The best-case scenario is hiring a new head coach and keeping Orgeron on staff in his role as defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator. Orgeron insists he’s learned from his mistakes at Mississippi, where he went 10-25 in three seasons, and I’m inclined to believe him. To see whether he can be a full-time head coach, though, should be the risk of another school with smaller expectations and a less-qualified pool of coaches to choose from.
There’s still a chance, however, that Orgeron will stick around. If Steve Sarkisian is fired by Washington and would be willing to return to USC as the offensive coordinator, then a Trojan Family reunion might have a shot of making things work.
Still, the USC job is one of the most coveted in the world of college football. Orgeron is not qualified for the most prestigious coaching position this side of Texas (sorry, Steve Alford) — at least not yet. A UCLA win is what fans want most right now, but what’s more important is what happens in Pat Haden’s office once the lights go out in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the final time in 2013. Trojan fans should hope rationality is the key factor in his decision.

You did not make your case not to select Coach O. Some very successful USC coaches (McKay, Robinson, Carroll) since my time as a student did not have successful college head coaching experience. Furthermore, unless the hire is a home run like a Saban (which won’t happen) there are many potential short term setbacks in recruiting, coaching staff turnover, and juniors leaving early for the NFL to consider.
There is another scenario that could be a win-win for everyone. Give Coach O a 2 year contract. This will give him the opportunity to show that the 2013 turnaround was not a fluke and allow USC to complete the sanctions and start building back up. Some may argue that the 2 years doesn’t reflect confidence in Coach O and that might impact recruiting. Well,  the interim title hasn’t hurt recruiting and the truth is that many top recruits want to come to USC due to the football tradition, NFL success, location, academics, etc. Furthermore, if they are coming to USC because of Coach O then they will have the confidence that he will do well enough to have his contract extended. This will allow Coach O to show that he can be a very successful coach at USC (win the next 2 games and he will be 7-1 and 7-0 in the Pac-12 during his audition) for the long run. If that doesn’t happen then Haden has the flexibility to bring in a top college coach after the sanctions have ended.
James Franklin should be the next head coach of USC
James Franklin has proven he can coach in a power conference. SEC is not only the best conference, but it also has the best collection of coaches and coordinators. Football matters in the SEC country.
Vandy had no winning tradition or culture prior to James Franklin. Whatever respectability that Vandy has, James Franklin has created it. Vandy prior to his arrival went to 4 bowls in its entire history, under James Franklin they have went to three. Prior to Franklin, Vandy record in November was 3-32, under Franklin it is 8-2. He has done more with less. When CEO was at Ole Miss he was 10-26, never won more than 3 conference games his entire tenure, at a time when Bama was mediocre and the power of the SEC was in the East with UGA and FLA. CEO winning percentage is 28%. Maybe he has learned from then, but let him prove that at a lesser program not USC.
Recruiting
At Vandy James Franklin has had top 25 recruiting classes and last year class was ranked 19. Remember this is Vanderbilt, an academic school parallel to Northwestern, Stanford, Rice, and Duke. Plus, he is recruiting against UGA, FLA, Tenn, Bama, LSU, FSU, V-Tech, Clemson, South Carolina, Arkansas, and etc. All these school are places where football matters, and with big budgets, and who willing to pay coordinators $1MM, and with passionate fans.. Something we in the west cannot fathom. Football is a religion in the South. Yet in the midst of that James Franklin is succeeding with a deck stack against him
Facilities: prior to James Franklin,Vandy showed little support for its football program, and it sub-standard facilities. James Franklin has been able raise funds for a new indoor practice facilities and other amenities. This shows that he has the charisma to successful talk to boosters and alumni.
All I am saying there is another option and better. This decision is about the next ten years. James Franklin is smart, great recruiter, creative offensive mind, and has the energy and enthusiasm akin to Pete Carroll.
Also, I believe James Franklin would be able to win over the current roster and keep the class intact. Also, he would have instant credibility in the inner-cities of Los Angeles and other places. James Franklin is a proven winner, and has done it consistently, and on a non-interim basis
James Franklin is a first-class individual and coach.
As an USC alum, I believe James Franklin should be strongly considered by USC.
There is definitely a case to be made that, even if we win the final two games, Orgeron is not right for the head coaching job. But this article fails to make that case and, in addition, shows a lack of understanding of reality.
There’s no scenario where Orgeron wins out, doesn’t get offered head coach at USC, and stays. He will be the head coach somewhere next season, for better or worse. It’s also laughable to think that Sarkisian would take a step down from head coach at Washington to offensive coordinator at USC. You don’t seem to understand how the coaching chain works.
You also mention USC needing a coach with offensive pedigree. USC has made its name through DEFENSIVE coaches, such as Pete Carroll. Yes, we had some great offenses during his time, but we also had a one-loss season with a historically great defense. If Orgeron could keep the defense playing like it has been the past few games, we would have very successful seasons.
You are correct to say that Orgeron is not qualified for the head coaching job based on his experience so far. Neither was Kiffin, and we saw how that worked out. I can understand wanting to avoid making the same mistake twice. But if Orgeron wins out, I don’t see how they can’t offer him the job. It would put the person they did offer it to in an impossible situation.
To clarify, I understand that you are saying Sarkisian would be FIRED from Washington (a definite possibility), but if he is, he will get a head coaching job at another school with lower expectations. Then if he were to do poorly there, he might consider going back to a coordinator position at a bigger school.

A completely dumb ass article. Pete Carroll was a defensive person first where titles are won. You get a good
offensive coordinator to handle that side of the ball. No one knows for sure whether Orgeron is the best choice
for the job. Really only Saban and Urban Myers are sure things with no chance of them coming to USC. Sorry
to say that you are most likely a lansman of mine who has no knowledge of football history or even the present.
This article is awful. Your argument that USC needs to blow out opponents, like Oregon, may bring excitement to the program, but it does not correlate to winning a championship. If Oregon’s flashy offense is the answer, how come they have yet to win a national championship? Surely Baylor will win the national championship this year, right? Also, when you say Alabama “throttles” their opponents, are you talking about those “20-7” wins against teams like Mississippi State. You didn’t even acknowledge Orgeron’s greatest pro, the fact that he is one of the elite recruiters in the country. He may have been 10-25 at Ole Miss, but his recruiting classes went on to win back-to-back Cotton Bowls. Look, as a column writer for the Daily Trojan, you are better than this. I get the fact that you were trying to swim against the current here, but if you plan do that in future pieces back it up with a thorough, analytical argument.
Whatever the case, I do not envy Pat Haden’s job right now.
What a moron. First of all you don’t need a coach with an offensive pedigree, Carroll was a defensive minded coach and I think his tenure worked out pretty well. As far as Alabama having success offensively and “steam rolling” opponents they do this because they recruit the best players in the nation, they do this because there is a coach that the players believe in and want to play for. Coach orgeron does just that. He’s one of the best college recruiters in the nation. He knows the tradition and expectations at USC and he’s a leader. Sign him to a 3 year deal and let’s see what happens, any one else other than Jon grudge  would be a monumental disaster.
This article takes a very high seat condemning and blasting Orgeron. Sounds more like an annoying girlfriend who discredits everything you’ve accomplished in life by demeaning you’re successes and bringing up your past. GO UCLA.
Stay on your own website clown!
There are many things the Orgeron detractors are missing. The arguments (is he actually a good coach, is he just a rah rah guy, etc.) are starting to be ridiculous. The Ole Miss argument is also old. Some facts:
Is he a good coach? – Look at the defensive lines under him at Miami and at USC. Coach O’s defensive lines are among the best ever.
Can he get the players? – Look up his story. He is an amazing recruiter, but beyond that, the guy loves USC. He believes in the school and the Trojan family. Combine great natural recruiter with loving the school, and it’s a great fit.
Can he coach the WHOLE team (offense/defense) – He has done a great job delegating and managing the game and emotions on the sidelines.
Everyone calling for Del Rio, Sumlin, etc. None of these guys is a sure thing. Coach O is interviewing by actually doing a great job. I don’t see the downside in giving him a shot.
John McKay had two losing seasons his first 2 years as USC’s head coach (1960-61), so I suppose that made him unqualified to remain at USC for the following 14 seasons (whereupon he won 4 national ttitles, including in 1962)?
“The problem with his strategy is that perennial national title contenders don’t win titles through scrappiness or discipline; they win them by dominance.”  WTF, seriously???  Since when are either scrappiness or discipline mutually exclusive with dominance?  Does Mr. Freeman honestly think that either our 2003 or ’04 national championship squads never had to display scrappiness or discipline??
What about when the ’03 squad had to contend with the triple-OT loss to Cal, or the halftime deficit against ASU that following week (and oh, BTW, Leinart bounced back from injury to lead the team from behind after halftime–how’s THAT for “scrappiness”)?  Or how about the ’04 team’s halftime deficits against VA Tech, Stanford, and Oregon State (the latter played in a thick fog to boot).
I suppose Mr. Freeman would rather delude himself into revisonist history and convince himself that our national championship teams were truly “dominant” through all 60 minutes of every single game they played.  Me, I remember the REAL history, the adversity that those teams had to fight through and thus rightfully EARN their national titles.

USC Class of 1997
Daily Trojan Assistant Editorial Director, 1994-97
It embarrasses me how poorly written this article is. I can’t imagine you actually follow USC or college football in general. 
First, you say USC needs an offensive minded coach in order to dominate like Alabama. Alabama and Florida State, the top two teams this year, both have head coaches who are defensive minded.  Also, do you think that USC is not trying to throttle its opponent every week?  Like our gameplan is “hey let’s try to win by 3 every week!”
You also talk about how scrappiness and discipline don’t win championships, dominance does. You make it seem like these are separate things, like a team can’t be both disciplined and dominate. There are many aspects that go into being a dominate team. That 2005 USC team you mentioned had a damn good defense too, wasn’t just their offense.
Overall, I felt like your article was terribly written. I can’t imagine you have not spent any time around this football team, or any football team. You vastly discredit motivation and the other positive traits that coach O has brought this team. There are reasonable reasons why Coach O should not get the job, but you touch on none of them. I hope you use this article to improve your article writing ability, or else I suggest something other than sports journalism for your post-college plans.
I have to agree with this very mature author and his insight.  Oregeron is a nice guy but it’s way too early to hire him; he’s still on his 90 day probation, IMO.  I’d go a step further, however; Pat Haden is not up to his job as AD, largely for waiting far too long to fire Lane Kiffin, which inaction demonstrates a fundamental lack of wisdom and leadership.  We need a new AD as well.
This article is awful. Your argument that USC needs to blow out opponents, like Oregon, may bring excitement to the program, but it does not correlate to winning a championship. If Oregon’s flashy offense is the answer, how come they have yet to win a national championship? Surely Baylor will win the national championship this year, right? Also, when you say Alabama “throttles” their opponents, are you talking about those “20-7” wins against teams like Mississippi State. You didn’t even acknowledge Orgeron’s greatest pro, the fact that he is one of the elite recruiters in the country.

Sensibly stated article and opinion well adjusted. Just because we win a few games does not mean we have one winning coach. The players are just not growing up to be football players, Where are these players in all the losing games? Oregeron was there in all the losing games. And we need more than a winning coach to play against the power teams.
While it would be prudent to be patient in assessing whether Coach O can continue to deliver the wins, to suggest that only someone from another big name school or a professional team  is worthy of consideration to be anointed USC’s new head football coach is shortsighted.  Flash, charm and arrogance do not a leader make. That was just tried and failed miserably.  Rather than view the process of selecting a head coach as an opportunity to invoke coach envy among other Division I schools, how about focusing on the ability of the coach to motivate his players to do their very best for him knowing that he has their very best interests at heart.  If a coach can’t motivate, a team is unlikely to win. Coach O is engaged, enthusiastic and the players are committed to him – he has their backs.  USC should have his unless and until he proves otherwise.  If he continues to coach well, give him a one-year deal and let him show USC what he can do.
Daily Trojaner: 
Why would you give Coach Orgeron a one-year deal.  If you believe he is the most qualified for the job, then USC should commit to him fully and give him a five-year deal.  If you give him a one-year deal, it shows that university is not fully committed to him; and t would hurt recruiting because what recruit would commit to a coach that they do not even know will be around after their freshman year.  
Secondly, why is wanting a proven head coach shirt-sighted?  I want USC to get a coach with a proven track of a reasonable amount of success, recruiting ability, vision, and ability to run a program.  Coach O  does not have a track record of success as a head coach when he was on a non-interim basis.  His winning percentage at Ole Miss was 28% with no record of or  even hint of progress.  What coach in college you know had no record of success in the previous head coaching post before winning a national championship.  The top coaches in CFB today had some measure of success before they won a national title. 
Urban Meyer: prior success at Bowling Green and Utah
Nick Saban: prior success at Michigan State
Steve Spurrier: prior success at Duke University
Les Miles: prior success at Oklahoma State
Kevin Sumlin: prior success at Houston University
Mack Brown: prior success at North Carolina
Art Briles: prior success at Houston and was  successful high school coach.
James Franklin: having success at Vanderbilt.
Jimmy Johnson: prior success at Oklahoma State
I believe James Franklin should be chosen to be the head coach at USC. 
CEO should get an interview, but USC has to make a decision who is the most qualified and not who deserve this job.
In all of my years at USC, this may be the worst article ever published.  Banned from the locker room in 3….2….1….
Well put. I, too, am thrilled at Ed Ogeron’s success, but I lack enough knowledge or judgment on this matter to say that it would be best to retain him as head coach. I have to trust Pat Haden, with his impressive intellect, experience and training, will make the best choice, if not the one that has such mmediate and high emotional appeal.
Nice article for a creative writing class.
What are your specific points of contention to not pick Oregeron as the new HC at USC?
The Ole Miss story is old, as is ESPNs Finebaum, so that one isn’t valid.
Just asking.
What are you, in high school? This article makes no sense what-so-ever. Stick to biology or something like that, but not sports writing.

As the Trojans continue their preparation for Saturday’s Pac-12 matchup against Colorado, interim head coach Ed Orgeron has emphasized the importance of focusing on the Buffaloes, and not looking further ahead to UCLA.
Hot hand · In his last three games, Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler has completed 74.7 percent of his passes with four touchdowns. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Now that the team’s 24-hour rule to celebrate the Stanford win has expired, the Trojans are back to work and moving on to the next opponent.
“It’s a challenge, but we are going to stay focused on beating Colorado, and trusting our process,” Orgeron said.
The team is looking to extend its current four-game winning streak in the upcoming matchup with the Buffaloes. During that time, Orgeron says that his players have grown closer as a team.
“They know they’ve built something special, and they want to protect it,” Orgeron said.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler asserted that players have really locked in to Orgeron’s ‘One team, one heartbeat’ mentality.
“We are playing more for each other,” Kessler said. “We’re all buying into Coach O’s methods.”
With player support for the interim head coach pouring in following the team’s recent success, Orgeron expressed his gratitude and appreciation for his team.
“I’d run through a wall for them,” Orgeron said. “That is part of being a family.”
Locked In
After leading a game-winning drive and throwing for 288 yards and a touchdown against the Cardinal, Kessler received several congratulatory texts, including ones  from former USC quarterbacks Matt Barkley and Mark Sanchez.
Kessler, who was named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for his stellar performance, also had the opportunity to talk with former USC Hesiman trophy winner Matt Leinart before the game as he led the team out of the tunnel.
“[Leinart] told me that this is where you show them what you can do and this is where legends are born,” Kessler said.
As former Trojans continue to show support for the storied program they were once a part of, Orgeron continues to encourage outside support for his team, a tactic often used by former head coach Pete Carroll.
“Coach O was here when USC was on top, and he brings in guest speakers like Ronnie Lott and Ray Lewis, who are talking directly to me,” Kessler said. “He allows us to play loose and have fun, but we are still focused.”
Kessler credited the fan presence and electricity in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday night as a crucial factor in the Trojans’ ability to pull off the upset against Stanford, particularly in making it difficult for the Cardinal on offense.
“The energy helped a lot and made an impact right away, especially with the two timeouts they were forced to call,” Kessler said.
Moving on to Colorado, Kessler reinforced that the team was not going to overlook the 4-6 Buffaloes, who are fresh off a 41-24 win over Cal, their first Pac-12 victory of the season.
“We are going to treat it just like any other game,” Kessler said. “They are just another obstacle, it doesn’t matter who it is.”
Injury Report
Orgeron announced that senior outside linebacker Morgan Breslin underwent surgery for a sports hernia on Tuesday.
Senior running back Silas Redd is listed as questionable for Saturday’s game, while junior wide receiver Marqise Lee and sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams are listed as probable.
Lee hobbled off the field after catching Kessler’s crucial pass on fourth down late in the fourth quarter against Stanford. The catch allowed the Trojans to extend their drive and set up junior kicker Andre Heidari’s game-winning field goal.
Redd has not played since the first half of the Cal game and was missed against Stanford. The Trojans only amassed 23 yards rushing against a stout Cardinal front seven.
Williams has garnered a lot of praise lately, most notably when Athletic Director Pat Haden tweeted that Williams is one of the top five players he’s watched in his time at USC.
Orgeron credited assistant defensive line coach Pete Jenkins for Williams’ season, in which he has recorded five sacks and 62 total tackles. He had seven total tackles against Stanford.
“Williams is a special player,” Orgeron said. “He’s fast, he’s big and he’s very coachable.”
An aggressive pass rush will greatly help the USC defense in slowing down Colorado quarterback Sefo Liufau, who threw for a career-high 364 yards last week against Cal.

The USC men’s basketball team extended its winning streak to three games on Tuesday night at the Galen Center with a 76-62 victory over Cal State Fullerton, thanks in large part to a dominant performance by senior center Omar Oraby, who finished with 15 points, nine rebounds and a career-high tying six blocks.

Junior guard Byron Wesley continued his strong start to the season with a team-high 22 points to go along with eight rebounds.
“It’s nice to have three home wins under our belt,” head coach Andy Enfield said.
The game saw a rare bit of consistency in the starting lineup, with freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic making his second consecutive start. Enfield elected to use the same starting lineup that he did last Friday against Northern Arizona, and the unit showed a good deal of cohesion in the early goings, jumping out to a double digit lead just a few minutes into the game.
There was a notable absence of senior guard J.T. Terrell, who did not play in his second straight game. The team has not released an official reason for why the star is not playing, but Enfield did address his captain’s eligibility.
“We’ll make some decisions in these next couple days about his short term eligibility,” he said. “It is an academic reason, and he needs to do what is necessary to be a student athlete.”
The Trojans came out of the gate strong, something they had not been able to do in their first three games of the season. Against the Lumberjacks on Friday, USC struggled to find any sort of rhythm and trailed by double digits heading into the locker room.
Against Fullerton, USC struck early and often, and the outcome of the game was never in doubt. The Trojans were swarming defensively, and forced seven turnovers in the first six minutes.
On the other end, USC drew six quick fouls and was sent to the free throw line nine times in the first few minutes.
Against Northern Arizona, the Trojans were atrocious at the line, missing 17 shots at the charity stripe. After that game, Enfield made the players stay and make more than 100 free throws before heading home for the night.
Clearly the extra work was effective as USC improved from the line, making 21 out of 30 free throw attempts.
The early lead allowed Enfield to experiment with a few other players, most notably sophomore forward Strahinja Gavrilovic.
Gavrilovic entered the season as a potential starter at the power forward position, but had yet to make a big impact before tonight. He entered the game midway through the first half and was able to contribute quickly, notching a quick bucket and defending very actively.
In all, 11 players were used in the first half, a luxury that Enfield was able to afford as a result of his team’s dominating performance.
The second half saw more of the same, as the Trojans’ command of the game never faltered.
Freshman guard Julian Jacobs kept up his stellar play that has earned him a spot in the starting lineup, scoring five quick points to help the Trojans build their early lead. Jacobs finished the night with 10 points, seven rebounds and five assists.
USC weathered a run from the Titans midway through the second, as Fullerton cut the lead to 10, but Enfield’s squad was able to persevere and never came close to giving up the lead.
Wesley, who has been the team’s most consistent player so far this season, took over in the second half and spurred a stagnant USC offense to keep the lead in double digits.
“He almost had a triple double, and he shot 80 percent from the field,” Enfield said. “We do expect a bit more on the defensive end sometimes, but that’s more a conditioning problem.”
A 3-pointer from senior guard Pe’Shon Howard a few minutes later bumped the lead back up to 14, virtually sealing the victory for the Trojans.
The Trojans were able to generate fast-break points thanks to Fullerton’s 17 turnovers.
“Defensively, we’re always active,” Jacobs said. “Whenever we get a rebound, we do our best to push and try to get an alley-oop.”
During the game’s final minutes, Enfield went with an unusual lineup, opting to rest Oraby for large stretches of time in favor of senior center D.J. Haley alongside Gavrilovic in the frontcourt. This lineup was able to hold off a final push for Fullerton and clinch the victory.
The Trojans pick up play again on Thursday against West Alabama at the Galen Center.

USC has formed an alliance with Pasadena’s Pacific Asia Museum, President C. L. Max Nikias announced in a statement Tuesday morning. The museum will now be called the USC Pacific Asia Museum.
“With its rich history and inspiring works of art, Pacific Asia Museum will be the perfect complement to many academic endeavors at USC,” Nikias said in the statement. “Both of our organizations work to enrich the educational experience, advance art history and preserve the past for future generations.”
The Pacific Asia Museum has a collection of more than 15,000 objects and works of art housed in a Pasadena mansion modeled in Chinese Qing dynastic style. It is one of the few museums in the United States that focuses only on Asia and Asian art.
The museum, which serves the Pasadena, San Gabriel and Los Angeles communities, was struggling financially. In July, committee members approached USC about a possible partnership.
“We have had trouble in the last five years with the recession keeping the museum running full tilt,” said Elizabeth Short, trustee and chair of the museum’s strategic planning committee. “What we needed was to be able to have a bigger endowment.”
Short also said museums need to have an endowment that provides enough interest to fund 30 to 50 percent of the operating budget.
“If you don’t do that, you are always going to be in trouble no matter how big your shop is or your café is or how many people go through the museum,” Short said.
The museum considered a number of partnerships with national and local art and educational institutions, but USC was at the top of the list.
“We’re partnering with a Pacific Rim university that is very renowned that I think it will enable us to serve and attract a much broader base,” Katherine Murray-Morse, chair of the museum’s board of trustees, said. “It will have a much greater impact on the community.”
USC has a growing graduate and undergraduate Asian population and, as part of its responsibilities in managing the museum, it will tap Asian donors to create a $20 million endowment. The museum’s board of trustees will become an advisory council and the USC board of trustees will hold fiscal responsibilities.
The partnership is not the first of its kind. The Textile Museum in Washington, D.C. partnered with The George Washington University and is constructing a new building on the campus. Still, Short, who is also on the board of the Textile Museum, said she was surprised and please at the speed and ease with which USC agreed to the partnership.
USC already has partnerships with organizations such as the Shoah Foundation, and the University Park Campus is home to the Fisher Museum, whose director, Selma Holo, will also serve as interim director of Pacific Asia Museum. The museum will form a joint search committee in January to find a permanent director.
“There are a number of things USC is bringing into the fold that will enhance its teaching capability and it can provide what art institutions need,” Short said. “A museum is an educational institution whether it has a university with it or not. You teach about the culture and you teach about how to make art and the importance that art has in people’s lives.”
Campus administrators are currently working with the museum to create a potential graduate program in museum curation and exhibit creation to bring artwork and objects to the museum and to campus.
Professor George Hayden in the department of East Asian Languages and Cultures said that though many of his courses do not accommodate time for field trips and he has not been to the Asia Pacific Museum for many years, he always enjoyed visiting the museum.
“It’s a great thing, a very pleasant experience and I would certainly encourage students and faculty to go,” Hayden said.
Murray-Morse believes the partnership will prove mutually beneficial and said she is excited about what the future holds for both the museum and the university.
“It’s a great university with such strength in the art field and Asian studies,” she said. “We hope to provide additional resources to augment what [the university] already has.”

USC Program Board Speakers Committee hosted Jason Russell, co-founder and chief creative officer of Invisible Children as well as the director of the viral documentary Kony 2012, paid a visit to USC Tuesday night to discuss the role of social media and how to utilize it for social change.
No boundaries · Alumnus and co-founder of Invisible Children Jason Russell speaks about the power of social media on Tuesday evening. – Uracha Chaiyapinunt | Daily Trojan
Russell, a USC alumnus, was propelled to fame through the viral video Kony 2012, which was uploaded online and eventually amassed more than 98 million views on YouTube. Kony 2012 focused on exposing the crimes of Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda.
Throughout the event, Russell discussed his continuing work with Invisible Children, as well as with the Kony 2012 campaign. Russell believed the video became so popular in a short time because of the variety of storytelling characteristics utilized in the documentary.
“I think that it was because it had heart, and it had humanity, and it had humor, it had heartbreak, it had horror,” Russell told the Daily Trojan. “So it had all these elements of what makes a powerful story: You had a very clear villain, the villain seen through a young 4-year-old’s eyes.”
Russell also discussed the reactions he and his team had once they realized how much attention their documentary was garnering.
“Our goal for the whole year was 500,000 views,” Russell told the Daily Trojan. “But I told the team, ‘Come on, let’s dream big and try for 3 million views,’ and we had 500,000 views within 12 hours and, I believe, 3 million views within the first 72 hours.”
Russell also addressed the criticisms that the Kony 2012 campaign drew after their video became famous, and what he learned from that experience.
“For me, it was that you really can’t control the media — a lot of things are said but there’s not a lot of accountability. So you don’t really know who to trust and there were landmines at every level of as far as what is the truth,” Russell told the Daily Trojan. “Even today, there are still so many millions of people who think Kony is dead, that Invisible Children is a scam, that we don’t put the money towards our initiatives, so I felt like my breakdown and all of that had to do with me trying to control what the media was putting out.”
Russell did not hesitant to joke about his minor scandal back in October 2012, when he was arrested for public indecency.
“After my breakdown I felt like I had two options. One was to hide, and the other option was to go out and say, ‘Yeah, I was butt-naked crazy in the street, I really was. I’m sorry if that offended you or hurt you. I’m sorry if you got made fun of at your school for defending Kony 2012 and Invisible Children and then your leader goes and loses his mind,’” Russell said. “I think, as cheesy as it sounds, I was reminded of USC’s ‘fight on’ [slogan] … that’s just kind of who I am.”
Many students who attended the event were impressed with how candidly Russell discussed his scandal.
“I think he did a really good job tackling [the controversies],” said Susana Heilbron Allara, a freshman majoring in global health. “I really liked his honesty.”
Several audience members agreed that coming to the event had changed their initial perceptions of Russell as a person from when they first heard about the Kony controversy.
“At first, I was very enthralled by [the documentary] and very interested in it,” said Sophie Ipsen, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “But then when all the controversies came out, I was a bit skeptical about what exactly was going on and I did kind of think twice about some of the stuff. Seeing this talk with him today really clarified a lot of things. It really showed me the nature of the movement is very genuine.”

Beginning this past Thursday, Taggle, a startup company created by a USC student, and the Undergraduate Student Government joined together in a collaborate effort to provide relief aid to victims of Typhoon Haiyan.
The tropical storm, which tore through the Philippines a little more than a week ago, is said to be one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded. It left thousands of people dead and millions more seeking shelter. As part of the push for aid that is taking place on a global scale, Jason Wei, a senior majoring in business administration at USC and co-founder of Taggle, decided to pitch into the relief effort.
“As a T-shirt company, we thought that the best way that we could give back would be to give away free ‘Support the Philippines’ shirts,” Wei said. “We’re taking this purely out of pocket in order to help out the people in the Philippines.”
Taggle is a reverse-auction site for T-shirts that was founded by USC students Wei and Sarah Bernosky last year. On it, local printers can bid to secure custom T-shirt orders that were previously posted by customers. Through the same site, interested parties can now also access a donation page for the Haiyan relief effort. On the page, they can post a donation of any amount, and receive in return the limited edition T-shirt.
Taggle released an update to the campaign on Monday, in which donors also receive a promotion code that gives them a 10 percent discount on their next purchase from Taggle. All proceeds from the campaign go to the Philippine Red Cross.
“We noticed that there were no other campaigns out there that offer a free T-shirt,” Wei said. “Because of our team’s design expertise, we thought that we could come up with a shirt that could spread awareness of the issue, because not many people are aware.”
As part of the attempt to raise awareness, Taggle has teamed up with USG, which is currently working on publicity on a more local level, aiming to bring the relief effort onto campus. Through its newsletter and a wide range of social media — including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter — and word of mouth from more than 300 delegates, USG is alerting the student body of Taggle’s ongoing campaign and what it can do to help.
Olivia Diamond, USG senior director of communications, set up the current partnership with Taggle. She said the value of such group collaboration is that it provides a quick and efficient way for students to get involved in relief efforts.
“[Starting] something from scratch is hard, because in these types of natural disasters, immediate response is key,” Diamond said. “It’s putting our expertise to better use to promote an already existing initiative, because Taggle is doing a great job.”
Beyond its collaboration with USG, Taggle itself is hoping to reach out on a national scale, and has already prompted responses from across the United States and the Philippines. As of now, more than 50 people have donated on the Taggle site, in addition to hundreds of likes on social media.
USG’s promotion efforts have had a similar effect in the USC community, as Diamond said there has been a strong response from the student body.
“We have had feedback directly from students who have messaged the USG page who have thanked us for working on this,” Diamond said. “And hopefully students are taking our information and our posts and sharing it well.”
The donation page is scheduled to be up for at least another week.

Winter is coming. For some parts of the world, winter entails cold weather and an excuse to cuddle up with someone. In Los Angeles, winter means wearing a jacket if it’s overcast and pretending that 68 degrees is enough to complain about.
Aside from weather, winter also brings the holidays upon us. Holidays are centered around friends and family and love and, when coupled with cold(ish) weather, people feel the urge to touch each other in affection. The need to touch another person is actually a year-round activity among humans. This is why people have birthdays in every month of the year.
Cuddling is one of the most basic comforts that humans crave. Food, water and shelter are essential but so is human touch. Skin on skin contact comes in many forms. Family members can hug, partners can kiss and best friends can slap you upside the head if you’re acting dumb.
But what if cuddling was viewed as a profession? It is certainly a service that is in constant demand. Two businesses, Cuddle Therapy and The Snuggery, are capitalizing on the lucrative potential of professional cuddle services.
Sometimes, you have an extremely rough day or week and you might just feel especially lonely. In addition to comfort food and talking to close friends, cuddling with someone provides stress relief. This is when Travis Sigley of Cuddle Therapy or Jacqueline of The Snuggery arrive on the scene. Their businesses revolve around people hiring them for non-sexual intimacy, offering by-the-minute or hourly rates.
The Frequently Asked Questions pages of both business websites are pretty adamant that the cuddle sessions are not sexual in nature, though arousal does often happen and should not be a source of embarrassment.
If this idea still seems odd, then do a quick Google search. “Professional cuddler” is the third search option in the dropdown menu of suggestions when you begin typing “professional c-” even before “professional cover letter” and “professional carpet cleaning.” Apparently, this trend has caught on.
The Snuggery is based out of Chicago and Cuddle Therapy is located in San Francisco but never fear, Angelenos, there are still options for those of us living in a warmer climate. Private Cuddle is a company that employs cuddle specialists available for hire. Though the previous two businesses are far more emphatic that their cuddling services are solely provided for emotional comfort, Private Cuddle is more ambiguous in its aim.
One bonus is that Private Cuddle allows patrons to choose whether they prefer to cuddle with a man or woman. In the description of their services, however, a certain key adjective stands out: “attractive.” Cuddle Therapy and The Snuggery exist so that a person’s mental and emotional health can be improved through the healing power of touch. Private Cuddle, on the other hand, also offers special rates for companionship services.
The necessity to label its cuddle specialists as “attractive” is a little troublesome because it places emphasis on an attraction between employee and patron. Granted, if you’re going to cuddle with someone, physical repulsion is not preferable but Travis and Jacqueline seem to be perfectly accommodating individuals. Their services do not have this same connotation nor do they feel the need to flaunt this aspect of the business.
Furthermore, the Private Cuddle website features a sultry woman in bed as its most prominent image. Jacqueline of The Snuggery is also pictured in bed but in a warm, friendly way that does not scream “SEX!” This brings the discussion toward the most prominent issue that arises concerning professional cuddling services: Is it weird to hire someone to cuddle with you?
Relationships come and go. Family can be located far away and friends can’t always fit you into their schedule. So a cuddle-for-hire service makes sense from an objective point of view. The association with other physical services for hire is still there. Can it be avoided? With businesses such as those of Travis and Jacqueline, the answer seems to be yes. Their services are based upon emotional satisfaction rather than flaunting the physical appeal of employees.
In an interview with the New York Daily News, Travis Sigley said that “A lot of people are really disconnected from each other, and socially or personally awkward.” Some people might consider this statement ironic because to them, having to hire a cuddle specialist would seem “socially or personally awkward.” If you think about it, though, even people who do not hire professional cuddlers can do some pretty socially and personally awkward things to each other.
Remember last week when you passed that person you used to hook up with on your way to class? Or when you abruptly swiveled your head to avoid making eye contact with somebody you dated two semesters ago? Everyone is guilty of social and personal awkwardness. Those who believe themselves to be immune need more than a professional cuddle session. Acting this way around someone doesn’t mean you lack social skills or that you’re permanently awkward, it just means you weren’t in the mood for social shenanigans in that specific moment.
Nobody has the right to judge where another finds affection. Certain methods might not be the route one person would take but that doesn’t mean it won’t work for somebody else. It’s sort of similar to how some people sleep without a night-light — I understand this logic and I fully support it, but I would never take part in it.
Snuggling is serious business. We all need it from time to time. Whether you find emotional comfort in the arms of someone you know or someone who does it for a living is completely up to you. Just remember to snuggle safely and responsibly.

Wonderful article, Nick! 
It seems like technology and urban living are driving factors in touch deprivation. Private Cuddle, The Snuggery, The Snuggle House and Cuddle U are wonderfully healthy ways to deal with the abscence of loving, therapeutic touch.
Hugs for everyone!

Mastering the Five Traits of a Trojan — faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous and ambitious — supposedly produces the ultimate USC student. But student and professional alumni entrepreneurs argue that these qualities create more than just the ideal student — they create innovators.

Two young USC alumni entrepreneurs especially embody these characteristics. Amarelle Hayes, a graduate of USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, started a chocolate company after graduation, and Suzy Ryoo, an alumna of USC Marshall School of Business, developed a zippered dress shirt as part of her startup.
Ryoo’s company LK3 was recently fully funded thanks to the company’s Kickstarter campaign. The LK3 Kickstarter will close this Thursday, and the LK3 zippered dress shirt will be available for pre-order the following day.
As an alumna, Ryoo said she believes the Trojan lifestyle fosters amazing entrepreneurs since Trojans are taught to be faithful, and to honor the Trojan family.
“At USC, there is a general spirit of one community,” Ryoo said. “With the USC alumni network, Trojans with innovative startup ideas have the resources and support system to launch their vision.”
Ryoo describes this idea of helping each other through the Trojan network as a cycle of circular repetition. She said when students are beginning their college careers and searching for that initial sense of purpose, the Trojan network helps guide them in the right direction.
Once they graduate and realize their ambitions, the USC culture encourages them to give back, like Ryoo does.
“USC gave me the launching pad to build my startup,” Ryoo said. “After graduating, I have only felt a really strong urge to go back and do more.”
Ryoo was the youngest mentor in the Marshall Career Advantage Program. She said she gained so much from her mentors as a student that she was eager to return the favor.
“I was so passionate about the [USC] community, and I think that was in my blood,” Ryoo said. “Now I love still being really active in the Trojan network.”
Ryoo considers her startup, LK3, an interdisciplinary design collective that serves as a cross section of “advertising, technology and new media.” Her first product is a reinvention of a men’s traditional button-down dress shirt that she hopes will create a new staple in the fashion market.
She said that the interdisciplinary approach to education USC encourages among their scholarly student population has influenced her business strategies.
Hayes, a graduate of the  Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, used her culinary skills to spark her own business endeavor: a chocolate company.
After taking classes through her entrepreneurship minor, she created the chocolate company, Chic Choc by Amarelle.
Hayes said she believes the USC culture fosters entrepreneurial thinking because of the ambitious drive among college students, but she said she is hesitant to call it something unique to USC.
“I don’t know if it is necessarily a ‘Trojan trend’ since, in general, entrepreneurship is becoming more enticing for young crowds,” Hayes said. “Startups are a common result of the mixing of smart, innovative and honestly, wealthy students.”
Hayes said the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies through the Marshall School of Business helped her master her business skills to produce a successful product. The faculty of the Greif Center includes both academics and professional entrepreneurs who provide guidance based on academic theory and their helpful “real world” experience.
Ryoo agreed that being around other ambitious students encouraged her to eliminate her self-doubt and implement her creative inspiration into her first concrete prototype that later grew into her LK3 company.
“You see other people doing well and you see other people exploring,” Ryoo said. “I think that sense of community is empowering.”
Ryoo said that when she was a student, her group of entrepreneur friends would meet once a month for what they called “mastermind dinners.” They would listen to one another’s startup ideas and provide constructive criticism.
“At one ‘mastermind dinner,’ I literally brought an early prototype of the product I now have developed and had other ‘masterminds’ try it on and give me really helpful feedback,” Ryoo said. “Then, we had no idea what it would be today, but it helped me build my entrepreneurial mindset through the help of other students.”
Hayes said the final quality embodied by both entrepreneurs and Trojans is courage.
“The drive is there for many people,” Hayes said. “Now, it’s a matter of getting out there and doing it.”

Everybody has a story to tell. And with The Lloyd Project, USC students prove just how a person’s personal experience has the ability to touch anyone’s life.
Keeping it real · Theater students rehearse for the upcoming The Lloyd Project production. The monologues are taken from student submissions. – Photo courtesy of The Lloyd Project
Returning to USC at the Massman Theatre, The Lloyd Project contains 10 monologues which have been submitted by real USC students. These monologues are written to capture the full emotional depth of students’ real stories, which challenges the actors to fully honor the submitted stories in order to do the writers and their stories justice. These students can be of any major, and are able to choose to have their piece credited or to remain anonymous.
The Lloyd Project is dedicated to Lloyd Cymrot, who passed away after fighting Lou Gehrig’s disease for 15 years. Cymrot completely lost the ability to speak for the last four months of his life. The Lloyd Project is a way for those who have literally, or figuratively, lost their voice to be heard. The project was founded in 2012 by Chelsea-Anne Cymrot, the daughter of Lloyd, a newly graduated USC student from the School of Dramatic Arts.
Directed by Grace Anaclerio, this play is unique in its portrayal of stories and challenges that are written and submitted directly by the student body. The monologues cover various aspects of USC students’ lifestyles, with topics ranging from “Drugs, Alcohol, and Judgment” to “My First Sexual Experience.”
“This year, our overarching theme is identity: individuality and uniqueness on one end of the spectrum, and on the other, sameness/commonalities that have the potential to bring people together,” Anaclerio said.
The rehearsal process begins with the creative team meeting with the actors on an individual basis. Toward the end, however, they begin to meet as an ensemble.
“We’ve identified correlations between these narrators and the experiences that have so impacted them,” Anaclerio said. “We have sought to create a cohesive play that treats the lives of our community members as interconnected.”
The Lloyd Project is the first USC production that Bryan Li, a freshman majoring in theatre, is taking part in. Li is performing the monologue “Untitled.”
“What I find really cool is that we’ve all come together for the same reason: to share the stories of others, and it has been such a privilege to be able to share someone’s own personal story,” Li said. “It makes this show much more relatable and intimate.”
As incredible as this project seems, it is not easily created overnight.
“I think, for me, the most challenging part of this process was simply doing justice to the stories,” Li said. “There’s more pressure to ‘do it right’ and not butcher their personal accounts that they are sharing. I think it’s very important that we remember that and when we are performing we don’t act their monologues, but rather share their monologues.”
Because of the unique quality of the show, casting is done much differently than it is in a standard production, as there are not set roles to cast, but a more general need for committed actors who will fully enter the character of the writer in order to empathetically re-enact a stranger’s story.
“Our cast’s appreciation for and commitment to these stories shone through in their auditions,” Anaclerio said. “I think that great actors are often empathetic, understanding and compassionate people.”
Rather than simply calling the actors “narrators of the monologues,” Anaclerio explained that the cast and crew refer to them as “people.”
Submissions are accepted anonymously in order for the writers to be as truthful as they can be without the pressure of revealing their identity. For Anaclerio, the anonymity allows more space for innovation.
“Some of our pieces were submitted anonymously, so we can’t know whose stories they are,” Anaclerio said. “But that can be even more exciting creatively, because walking on Trousdale, sitting in class, our ‘people’ can be anyone.”
Because of the wide variety of relatable stories, The Lloyd Project is a great production for not just theater majors, but students with all interests and of all ages to see. Anaclerio said the project embodies the idea that everyone’s individual story has value.
“By dramatizing the real-life experiences of USC students, The Lloyd Project validates all individuals and reminds our student body that everyone has a story, and every story matters,” Anaclerio said.
And if there’s one thing that the audience should take away from the project, it’s the close ties the stories portrayed in the show have with every person’s life.
“[It’s] your story,” Anaclerio said. “Your show.”
The Lloyd Project runs from Thursday until Sunday at the Massman Theatre. For tickets, email thelloydproject@gmail.com. Tickets are a $5 suggested donation, and all proceeds from ticket sales will go to support future USC Independent Student Productions and ALS (Lou Gherig’s Disease) research.

In recent years, making the transition from screen to stage has become somewhat of a Disney hallmark. The Broadway production of Beauty and the Beast in 1993 earned Tony nominations just three years after the production of the animated film. 2004 saw the release of a theatrical version of the Disney classic Mary Poppins. And in 2008, The Little Mermaid hit the stage and excited audiences with its roller-skating mermaids and underwater art design.

This week, however, Disney’s most successful onstage venture lands in Los Angeles for a run at the Pantages Theatre: Disney’s The Lion King. This particular production represents the first time the show has been in Los Angeles since its sold-out run in 2006.
“We’re really happy to be back,” ensemble performer Erynn Marie Dickerson said. “I wasn’t with the show the last time it was in Los Angeles a couple of years ago. This is really exciting for me and a lot of other people, so [we] couldn’t wait to get to L.A. … Homecoming is always really exciting whenever we replay a city.”
For Dickerson, who graduated from the joint BFA program with The Alvin Ailey Dance Company and Fordham University, this production of Disney’s The Lion King has particular sentimental value.
“I’m from Los Angeles originally so to play my hometown and to play the biggest theater in my hometown is such a blessing and such an honor, and I can’t wait to do it,” Dickerson said. “I think absolutely every single show has been through that iconic theater. So for me to be [onstage at the Pantages] is a little bit unreal for me.”
Of course, Disney’s The Lion King should resonate with everyone, particularly those who are familiar with the animated classic. The theatrical version tells the familiar coming-of-age tale of the lion cub Simba as he battles against his uncle, Scar. The love story between Simba and Nala remains intact, as does Simba’s friendship with the meerkat Timon and the warthog Pumbaa. Still, Dickerson warns, theatergoers should not expect an exact replica of the cinematic version they know so well.
“It is kind of extremely different from an adult’s point of view,” Dickerson said. “If you’re going to see it as an adult, you won’t feel like you’re seeing a cartoon transferred on stage. It’ll be night and day … For an adult, it’s not an expensive nap. And for a child, it’s not above their head. So it works for everybody. It’s a great date night. It’s a great group event. It’s so perfect for absolutely every age.”
In addition to its versatility, the show also contains a series of unique scenes and musical numbers that don’t appear in the animated version. With new songs such as “Chow Down” and “Shadowland,” it’s easy to see why Disney’s The Lion King earned a 1999 Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.
“There’s a song that comes up twice in the show [in the] first act and second act,” Dickerson said. “It’s titled ‘He Lives In You,’ and this is a song that both Mufasa [and Rafiki sing] to Simba. And that kind of reminds him about coming back home and not abandoning your family and knowing who you are, and that’s not in the Disney production of the cartoon movie. And it’s such a beautiful song. I mean we sing it in two different variations because it’s so great. I think people will really love it. It’s a really great addition to the show.”
There’s also something particularly energizing about seeing a live production of a beloved animated classic. Talented actors come up the aisles. Eight-foot giraffe costumes bob and nod at the audience. Carefully crafted sets of Pride Rock and the sun provide live-action interpretations of familiar cartoon settings. The performance ensemble fuses jazz, lyrical and West African dance styles together to fit the different tastes and moods of the musical’s scenes. One number, “The Lioness Hunt,” is a particular favorite for Dickerson.
“It’s just so primal, and it’s all [this] female energy on stage,” Dickerson said. “Dancing women. Lady singers. Lady dancers just going in. It’s kind of a [hot chase], so it’s exciting … You can really get into it. We go on stage with different themes. ‘Alright tonight girls, we’re going to do fierce. Tonight we’re going to be sultry. Tonight we’re going to do this.’ Lioness is definitely the best [character] that I play.”
This current run of Disney’s The Lion King, however, is not only distinct from the original film version. Instead, each production of the show contains its own nuanced qualities that make the musical worth seeing even between different theatrical runs.
“[I]t’s always great to introduce Lion King to a new generation of little ones and reintroduce it to people who maybe have seen it in New York because the production is slightly different than it is on that stage,” Dickerson said. “[We] have to accommodate for a theater that’s not our own because we bring a whole bunch of our own props. [We] have our own custom-made floor that we have to put down, and that’s not really conducive to every single theater. We can’t do that everywhere.”
Still, even with the minor differences that accompany this production, audiences can still expect the pleasant surprises that accompany Disney’s The Lion King. The show represents a cohesive masterpiece that is almost overwhelming in its artistry.
“Never get too comfortable in your chair,” warned Dickerson. “Watch your back. There’s lots of stuff happening throughout the whole house. You’ll probably be turning your head 360 degrees the entire show, because it’s so interactive … You feel like you’re transformed into a different place for three hours. You’re not in Los Angeles anymore. You’re in the savanna.”
 
Disney’s The Lion King runs at the Pantages Theatre from Nov. 20, 2013 to Jan. 12, 2014.

In the recent weeks, many professionals and social media gurus have warned young adults and teenagers to be wary of what they in public, and especially what they post on Facebook. Two people that should have gotten that heads up are Liz and Mary Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney’s two daughters.
On Nov. 17, Liz Cheney, the elder of the sisters, who is also running for a senate seat in Wyoming as a Republican, said on Fox News Sunday that she is opposed to same-sex marriage and supports a “traditional definition of marriage,” according to USA Today. Her younger sister Mary, who married her partner Heather Poe in 2012, challenged her statement on Facebook.
“Liz — this isn’t just an issue on which we disagree you’re just wrong — and on the wrong side of history,” Mary Cheney posted on Facebook.
The few weeks have mirrored the sisters’ debate. Last week, residents in Hawaii and Illinois made same-sex marriage legal in their states, making a total of 15 U.S. states (and the District of Columbia) where it has been legalized. In many more states, local state governments are considering legalizing same-sex marriage.
Liz Cheney’s outcry over her sister’s lifestyle choice is a political choice — one that she seemingly has only recently adopted. In response to her sister-in-law, Poe wrote that her sister-in-law was originally happy for the couple.
The sudden change in opinion seemingly came when Liz Cheney decided to run for political office in Wyoming, a mostly red state, and one in which she did not even reside until last year.
“I can’t help but wonder how Liz would feel if as she moved from state to state, she discovered that her family was protected in one but not the other,” Poe wrote on Facebook.
To add to the conversation that is sure to make Thanksgiving dinner awkward, their father, Dick Cheney, has publicly endorsed same-sex marriage. Dick Cheney issued a statement saying he was “pained” to see his daughters differ in opinion in front of a national audience.
The political tension mixed with differing family opinions has strained the sisters’ relationship. According to The New York Times, Mary Cheney once described her relationship with her sister as “being as close as sisters can be.” Since bringing the topic of same-sex marriage to the forefront of the political arena, however, their relationship has not been as strong.
Currently Liz Cheney is wearing two hats, but neither one too well. As a sister, she is failing to be supportive. As a politician, Liz Cheney is changing her values and beliefs, seemingly for political gain. Both should be considered troublesome as she moves forward in her campaign.
It is no secret that Liz Cheney faces a difficult battle against conservative Republican incumbent Mike Enzi in Wyoming. A recent poll said that Liz Cheney is currently 50 points behind the Senator, according to The Hill. Cheney has shown that she is willing to fracture the lifelong relationship with her sister for the sake of attracting a larger conservative vote.
As a Republican candidate heralding the values of family, Liz Cheney has looked past her own family in order to garner as much support as possible. Though her sister might not live the same lifestyle as she does, she should still support her.
And if Poe is to be believed, Liz Cheney was once supportive of her sister’s union — but only when her political career was not at stake.
Valuing politics over family is a faulty decision because though politics change and shift, members of the family are constant. Though the sisters’ words have ignited a national debate, perhaps Liz Cheney should solidify her beliefs behind closed doors before presenting them to the public.

“Currently Liz Cheney is wearing two hats, but neither one too well. As a sister, she is failing to be supportive. As a politician, Liz Cheney is changing her values and beliefs, seemingly for political gain…”
Liz also wear the daughter hat – she is being supportive in that case right?
Cheneys hate people. No surprise.
Unclear whether Liz Cheney was emotionally blurting out her distaste for same-sex marriage, or was cynically playing to the conservative voter base she needs for her election hopes. If she was motivated by her personal opinion, she should have kept her mouth shut rather than offend her sister and creating terrible family discord.
On the other hand, if she was motivated by political vote-getting considerations, she should also have kept her mouth shut. She seemingly demonstrated to her would-be voters that she has little regard for loved ones, even if she does have traditional values on marriage.
So either way, she damaged family relations, and so she probably lost some votes, even if she gained some. Yep, she should have kept her mouth shut and her opinion on this sensitive family matter to herself.

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford recently made headlines after a leaked video of him smoking crack cocaine went viral, forcing him to admit to drug use that had occurred while he was allegedly inebriated. The mayor of Canada’s largest city is now under pressure from city councilmembers and citizens to resign, and on Monday, the council voted to strip the mayor of many of his powers, essentially allowing him to retain only ceremonial duties.

Other than charges of drug use, Ford has been faced with claims of lewd and racist behavior and language. A massive police document was released last Wednesday outlining 97 allegations against Ford, according to the Toronto Star. The accusations range from hiring prostitutes and driving while intoxicated, to wasting taxpayers’ money and abusing his staff.
Political scandal is by no means a new issue in North America, and the U.S. government has had its fair share of politicians’ illicit behavior come to light. Gen. David Petraeus tendered his resignation after a leaked chain of emails revealed an extramarital affair with his biographer. Former Representative Anthony Weiner resigned from his seat in Congress roughly three weeks after a sexting scandal involving several women was revealed.
The difference here, however, is that all these public figures chose to resign their posts, due to outside urging or otherwise, where Ford continues to refuse to step down.
Even though Ford has publicly acknowledged and apologized for his actions, the embattled mayor has rejected calls for his resignation and declared that he has given up alcohol for good. The city council does not have the power to remove the mayor from office unless he has been convicted of a crime, and Ford has even stated that he plans to run for re-election next year. During the city council meeting in which Ford lost many of his powers, a heated debate broke out and the mayor even charged the gallery at one point, knocking down a councilwoman in the process.
Drugs impact the state of mind of individuals who use them, both by chemically interfering with the function of their bodies and through the disease of addiction. Whether Ford acknowledges it or not, he has likely been affected by these consequences.
Aside from his apparent drug and alcohol abuse, Ford’s behavior has been erratic ever since the international spotlight has shifted to the city when the scandal broke out. Ford surely deserves the punishments inflicted on him by the city council, despite his protests, but these power limitations do not stop Ford from retaining his title as the city’s top official. The fact is, this man is not in the right state of mind to be running a city.
The Canadian government does not seem to have a clear plan as to how they will manage the situation. Unless Ford is formally charged in a criminal court, there is a real possibility that he will remain in office until the end of his term next year. Even if he is charged, however, criminal cases take an extended period of time to resolve.
This issue indicates a need for greater checks on power in city government, Canadian or otherwise. Scandals involving drug abuse differ from sex scandals because they impact an individual physically as well as psychologically. If a criminal conviction is impossible, there needs to be another way to ensure the best interest of the city and its citizens.
The scandal involving Ford might be shocking, but it’s important to remember that a real city and real people are suffering the consequences of one man’s drug binge. Let’s hope Toronto doesn’t crack under the pressure.
