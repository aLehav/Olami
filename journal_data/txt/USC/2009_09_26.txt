A week after getting upended in Seattle, the Trojans were supposed to return to the Coliseum and take their frustration out on Washington State like a drunken step-father.
This one was supposed to be ugly. The 45.5-point spread was more of a generous suggestion for the Trojan offense, which ripped the lowly Cougars for 69 points last season.

When it was all said and done Saturday night, it most definitely was ugly, but not quite in the way USC had hoped.
After jumping out to a 20-0 first-quarter lead, the Trojan offense stalled, the penalty yards started piling up, and the final 27-6 score was way too close for a Washington State team that needed overtime to defeat Southern Methodist last week.
So what does it mean? Plain and simply, this USC team has a lot of problems to work out. For all its five-star talent and lopsided depth, there is great cause for concern for USC going forward.
Coach Pete Carroll addressed the issue immediately after the game.
“The way I look at this game, it’s great to win, it’s fun to win at the Coliseum, but we’ve got a lot of work to do,” he said. “It just was not at all the kind of satisfying win we’d like to have.”
And it wasn’t just a few bad breaks here and there. Across the board, after the first quarter, the Trojans lost their rhythm and their focus, putting up two goose eggs offensively in the second and third quarter before finally finding the end zone one last in the fourth quarter.
The most glaring dilemma taken from the win was that the Trojans did not learn from the mistakes that cost them an undefeated season last week. Their performance in the penalty department only got worse — they racked up 115 yards on 13 yellow flags, almost all of which killed drives and eliminated momentum.
It was not the kind of outing USC fans expected nor the kind the players expected from themselves.
“We had 13 penalties overall, so I think when we have those numbers we can always be playing better,” quarterback Matt Barkley said. “We’re gonna look back at the tape tomorrow … and see what can get corrected, but I do believe we can play better than we did tonight.”
As Carroll put it, “It’s not stuff that’s indicative of playing good football.”
Granted, some of the penalties USC was flagged for were awful calls, particularly a holding call on receiver Damian Williams that negated part of a long Joe McKnight run.
“I’ll challenge half of those calls,” Carroll said of the penalties called on his team, adding, “I thought Damian’s block downfield on Joe’s big run was a fantastic block. I think he dominated the guy so much they thought he held him.”
But Carroll still recognized the magnitude of the penalty problem, but not exactly with urgency.
“We need to start practicing now and clean some things up,” he said. “We certainly can give a game away playing like that, so that’s the part we have to get rid of.”
Another aspect the Trojans failed to improve much upon was third-down conversions. After failing to convert a single third-down last week, the Trojans mustered only three in nine tries Saturday, and this against one of the worst passing defenses in the country.
“We have to get right and we’ve got to keep working at it,” Carroll said. “There’s just a lot of room for improvement.”
Red zone scoring was also again a problem. The Trojans were stopped twice on fourth down inside Washington State’s 2-yard line, failing to put any points on the board and allowing the Cougars to hang around and gain confidence.
Another potentially glaring problem that was not fixed was fumbling. USC put the ball on the ground three times, losing two of them — one by Williams after a reception and the other by quarterback Aaron Corp while on backup duties.
These are problems the Trojans vowed to fix. These are issues they promised never to repeat. But after one week, the jury is still out on how capable this USC team is of cleaning up its mishaps.
After the game, the talk was already turning to next week, when the Trojans travel to Berkeley to face Cal in game that has lost a bit of its value after the Golden Bears suffered a 42-3 beating from Oregon Saturday. No matter how bad Cal looked against the Ducks, USC must fix the mistakes they have failed to correct in the last two weeks or it will be Washington all over again.
On that note, a reporter asked linebacker Michael Morgan what he took from Cal’s loss to Oregon.
“Don’t take anything lightly I guess, play everybody,” Morgan said.
Meanwhile, Barkley, who was sitting next to Morgan at the press conference, muttered under his breath, “We already learned that one.”
After the Trojans’ lackluster display Saturday against the Cougars, I’m not sure they have.

The story: USC easily handled Washington State, 27-6, but disappointments abounded.
USC began the game in dramatic fashion, forcing the Cougars into an immediate three-and-out and scoring in just three plays on the offensive end.
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
But the No. 12 Trojans (3-1) committed 13 penalties, lost two fumbles, and converted on only three of nine third-down plays.
And after the Trojans scored twice more to make it a 20-point first quarter, they couldn’t get on the board again until the fourth.
They held Washington State (1-3) scoreless for more than 59 minutes of the game, but the Cougars finally made it in to the end zone on a two-yard run by Dwight Tardy with 22 ticks remaining.
Said senior safety Taylor Mays postgame: “It sucks that they scored at the end.”
Key play: With USC up 13-0 late in the first quarter, junior kicker Jacob Harfman placed a surprise onside kick in perfect position. Harfman recovered his own kick and USC went on to score on the next play with a 57-yard strike from Barkley to receiver Damian Williams. That made the score 20-0, which held until the fourth.
“[The onside kick] was in the game plan this week,” junior center Kristofer O’Dowd said of the play that electrified the Coliseum crowd. “I didn’t think they were gonna do it, but I was pretty excited when I saw it.”
Carroll said Harfman impressed him. Making his debut at punter, the transfer from Mt. San Antonio averaged 46.3 yards per punt — a full nine yards better than his predecessor, fourth-year junior Billy O’Malley.
The return: Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley’s return from a bone bruise in his right shoulder was deemed a success, as the passing game opened up immediately for the Trojans. Barkley finished the day completing 13-of-22 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns.
“You can see that it hurt USC not having him last week,” Washington State head coach Paul Wulff said in his postgame press conference. “For a freshman, he did some good things.”
It took Barkley only a few throws to find his stroke. On his seventh toss of the night, he hit redshirt freshman Brice Butler for a 29-yard touchdown pass. On his eighth, he found Williams for another touchdown.
“From a receiver’s standpoint, we’ve been waiting to go deep,” said redshirt freshman Brice Butler, whose catch was his first-career touchdown reception. “We’ve been hungry for it, and we saw today that we can do it so hopefully we come out every week and do it.”
Most valuable player: Outside linebacker Michael Morgan. The fourth-year junior had a game-high 2.5 sacks and five tackles in his fifth career start.
He was chosen to do the postgame press conference with the media alongside Barkley, a usual.
The unassuming Morgan, who traditionally operates out of the spotlight, said it was unusual for him.
“I was more nervous in there than I was on the field,” he said later.
Surprise performance: Defensive end Nick Perry continued to impress with another two-sack performance. He has now registered six sacks in four games, good for a team-high. The six sacks are the most for a Trojan since Lawrence Jackson’s 10.5 in 2007.
Carroll spotlighted Perry after the game.
Stat of the game: The first quarter was by far the Trojans’ most productive – in both positive and negative yardage.
USC scored 20 points and produced 195 yards of offense in the first fifteen minutes of play, but also lost 75 yards on seven penalties.
“I can’t explain that,” Butler said. “I really don’t know. I really don’t know. “
Quotes of the game: No. 6 Cal’s 42-3 loss earlier in the day to Pac-10 rival Oregon was on many a player’s mind.
With the Trojans set to face the Bears in Berkeley next Saturday, they were looking ahead — and behind, to the loss to Washington last week.
“It does surprise me, but it doesn’t,” redshirt sophomore linebacker Chris Galippo said. “Because you could say that about the week before up in Seattle. It just so happens that Oregon stepped up this week and beat a good Cal team.
Added O’Dowd: “It’s a Pac-10 game in the Pac-10 conference. You don’t know what could happen, and we’re an example of that as well.”
