As the Wallis Annenberg Hall materializes, the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism has revealed more about the technology that will be integrated in the new building.
The building, which is being constructed near the Pertusati Bookstore on the corner of Watt and Childs ways, is on track for completion in May 2014 and set to open in fall 2014, according to Manager of Facilities Operations and Management Charles Peyton.
Assistant Dean of Operations James Vasquez said the renovations will allow the school to live up to its academic vision.
“It’s for the first time in the history of this school that the school has the opportunity to build a foundation or an environment that meets its curricular expectations and vision,” Vasquez said. “The expectation is that it’s going to include an environment that has a central hub or, as the dean puts it, ‘Village Green’ — a location that’s going to connect all of the spaces within the building itself.”
In addition to the new 88,000-square-foot, five-story building being able to accommodate a 2,200 student population — compared to the existing building, which was built to serve 100 — all student-run programs, such as Annenberg TV News, Annenberg Radio News and Annenberg Impact, will be converged into one space. The old space, however, will be used for office spaces and some classes, Vasquez said.
Peyton said one of the main programming goals of the project was to make it as unique as the students it will house.
“The idea is that not all programs are alike not all students are alike, and that’s a really positive thing,” Peyton said. “We really expect to have spaces that encourage students to come in and configure the spaces as they need or move from a space to another that is more conducive to what they’re working on or who they’re working with.”
To meet these goals, the project includes plans to build laptop lounges for group and project meetings as well as a series of study rooms and lobbies with movable furniture available for students to reserve.
Some students expressed high hopes for the construction of the building and are impressed by the progress thus far. Nicole Zerunyan, a junior majoring in public relations, said the renovations coincide with the changes occurring in an industry becoming that is becoming more reliant on digital media.
“Annenberg students are going into a digital world,” Zerunyan said. “I think having the new building will progress us as students. I think that being able to do that in college will help us in our future.”
Aidan MacAluso, a sophomore majoring in public relations, agreed that the new building represents the progressive direction of the industry.
“I think it’s important that you stay current in public relations and journalism,” MacAluso said. “I think that it’s very fitting that Annenberg is always up to date, and I think that creating the new building symbolizes this.”
Even for students like Angela Blakely, a second-year master’s of journalism student, the renovations will provide a more realistic experience.
“Since it will look more like a newsroom, I think more incoming students will feel that they are actually going to a school that’s putting them in the real life experience of being a journalist,” Blakely said.
Watt Way, between Childs and Downey Ways, will continue to be closed until April 2014. The roads closed down for construction will be re-opened in the fall 2013.

American music icon Patti Smith spoke to students, faculty and fans from around Los Angeles about her childhood, artistic influences, memories from the 1970s and her best-selling memoir Just Kids.
Evening tunes · Patti Smith, a singer-song writer, performs for and talks with students Tuesday evening at Bovard Auditorium. – Maddy Campion | Daily Trojan
 
Smith came to Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday evening as part of a Visions and Voices signature event.
Smith also treated the audience to a mini-concert, performing hits like “Because the Night” and “Banga.” She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007 and was included on Rolling Stone’s list of greatest artists in 2011.
Josh Kun, an associate professor of communication and journalism, moderated a conversation with Smith that touched on her approach to art, relationship with photographer Robert Mappelthorpe and childhood belief that toys come to life at night.
The 1975 release of Smith’s debut album, Horses, earned her the moniker “The Godmother of Punk” and included songs that paid homage to some of American music’s greats, such as Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix.
“The last song, “Elegie,” gave me a great way to deal with losing some of the best voices of my generation,” Smith said, who has often used art to transform grief. “You have to step back from [grief] and understand that what you’ve lost is a beautiful thing.”
In the question-and-answer segment at the end of the evening, Smith responded to one student with a nugget of artistic wisdom.
“As an artist, one should shed all ideas about race and gender. All of those labels are shackles,” Smith said. “The whole idea is to create a work that transcends all those things.”
This advice particularly resonated with Maxwell Subar, a freshman majoring in music industry.
“Tonight made me want to do what she does and express myself the way she does,” Subar said.
Known also for her activism and seminal artistic voice, Smith was named one of TIME’s most influential people of all time in 2011. She has been connected with the Green Party and has spoken out against the War in Iraq.
“I love my country,” Smith said after Kun asked her how American tradition influenced her work. “What we have going for us is our youth. Rock and Roll, Jackson Pollock, the Declaration of Independence — we gave that to the world.”
But Smith also spoke about her disappointment in America. “We have a lot of stains. We are tainted. And instead of trying to cleanse ourselves, we keep piling on more tainted-ness,” she said, woefully recounting how even as a 7-year-old she knew dropping bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was wrong.
Smith even touched on the current gun control debate.
“Our forefathers didn’t talk about the right to own machine guns,” Smith said. “They were more concerned about our right to ask questions.”
Many students came to the event to learn more about Smith.
“I’ve always admired her but just recently got into her music,” said Robert Guard, a senior majoring in film and television production who saw this as a Visions and Voices event he shouldn’t miss.
Meanwhile, some students have been fans of Smith’s for years, like Felicia Ho, a junior majoring in critical studies. Ho was in line to get her copy of Just Kids signed after the event.
“I’ve liked [Smith’s] music since I was in high school. She’s definitely one of my favorite artists,” Ho said.
Great article about Patti Smith and this night. Working on writing about this – so many valuable points were made by Patti Smith – heartfelt performances, such as “My Blakean Year”, and hearing first-hand her perceptions on topics such as transforming grief into art and transforming love into art, William Blake’s determination, the instantaneous-behavior or the universe and reality, and so much more. Not to mention it was William Burrough’s birthday!
Patti Smith is a treasure.

USC School of Cinematic Arts students, notable alumni and supporters graced the red carpet Tuesday at the dedication of the School of Cinematic Arts’ newest facility, the Sumner M. Redstone Production Building.
Film leaders · Dean Elizabeth M. Daley, Steven Spielberg, Frank Price, George Lucas, C. L. Max Nikias and Sumner Redstone pose. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The building, made possible by Redstone’s $10 million donation, houses 2,600 square feet of production space. Among those to walk the red carpet were alumni George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Lisa Ling.
Dean of the School of Cinematic Arts Elizabeth Daley highlighted the many opportunities that lie ahead for students.
“Nearly 1,000 students will learn how to produce, to work together, to fight together,” Daley said. “They will create their own brand of magic within these walls.”
To help students hone their production skills, the new facility is equipped with the latest technology, including state-of-the-art production equipment, lighting systems and sound equipment.
William Yelton, a freshman majoring in film and television production, said the event attendees showed how prestigious the school of Cinematic Arts is.
“I actually met George Lucas and had a chance to shake his hand. I pinch myself every day that I go to a school where I can attend events like this, work at amazing facilities like this and shake hands with the people who formed my childhood dreams.”
President C. L. Max Nikias expressed excitement for the role the new facility will play in the university’s future.
“This building is an important cornerstone of the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts,” Nikias said. “This is where our students’ creative ideas will find a place in the real world. This building will be a critical front in the battle for fresh storytelling. With the dedication of this building, Redstone has made his mark on the University of Southern California.”
Redstone, who donated $24 million to the Keck School of Medicine in 2010, is no stranger to Trojan philanthropy.
“Sumner has far exceeded anyone’s expectations for contributing to the Trojan community,” Spielberg said.
Redstone is the executive chairman and founder of Viacom Inc. and CBS Corporation.

What does having dinner with Shaquille O’Neal at a Brazilian steakhouse, taking a ride in Nick Saban’s golf cart and having identical twin sisters attached to your hip for a night out on the town have in common?
You’ve probably guessed it by now, but college football’s national signing day is today and the aforementioned scenarios are all attempts made by top SEC schools to lure in a strong recruiting class for their respective programs. To what extent do these recruiting classes matter? Does having a highly ranked recruiting class contribute directly to future success?
With less than half of the number of commits of other programs at this point in the recruiting process as a result of NCAA sanctions, USC has managed to assemble the No. 8 ranked class in the country according to ESPN. What the Trojans lack in recruiting volume they make up for in top-flight talent, including the consensus No. 1 pro-style quarterback in the country in Max Browne and Rivals.com five-star recruits Kenny Bigelow, Su’a Cravens and Leon McQuay III. The Trojans have had to pick their student athletes wisely, as evidenced by the fact that every single program commit is either a four- or five-star recruit.
The commitment of five players in the ESPN 150’s top 25 is no accident. Throughout the years, USC has had a reputation for strong recruiting. For instance, former standout players such as Matt Kalil, Robert Woods and Brian Cushing were all recruited as sought after five-star players. Browne’s recruitment, in particular, served as a poignant reminder to the rest of the Pac-12 of USC’s recruiting prowess. Browne hails from Sammamish, Wash., and many University of Washington fans lamented the fact that head coach Steve Sarkisian failed to recruit a quarterback whom had essentially grown up in the Huskies’ backyard.
Success in recruiting prior to a college snap being played could be attributed to coaching staffs and reputation, but the truest test of a recruiting class’ success is how a player’s abilities translate to the college level, and, ultimately, how those abilities translate to victories.
There is no doubt that USC’s reputation precedes it in the recruiting arena, and recent top-ranked recruiting classes have in fact yielded strong results. In the Pete Carroll era, the Trojans finished with Scout.com’s top recruiting class in the nation in 2003, 2004 and 2006. Pete Carroll’s tenure at USC was marked with seven straight top-five finishes, two national titles and a bouquet full of Rose Bowl victories. Though correlation does not necessarily imply causation, it is important to note that the recruiting classes that Carroll, and current USC head coach Lane Kiffin, brought to the program were direct contributors to success.
Breaking down successful recruiting to cases of individual players can hurt this argument; the recruiting process places far too much emphasis on individual players as opposed to an entire squad. Much like the NFL draft, the selection of athletes is mired in a giant stew of physical characteristics, athletic metrics and hype. And much like selecting players from the NFL draft, the entire stew can be ruined with a single drop of poisonous behavior or off-the-field issues.
Take, for instance, USC’s 2010 All-American running back recruit Dillon Baxter. Baxter was touted as the second coming of Reggie Bush, but he virtually checked into his tenure at USC in Kiffin’s doghouse and was dropped from the team shortly thereafter. He subsequently transferred to San Diego State, where he was dropped within a month; he is now attempting to make a comeback playing at the junior college level. Countless other five-star recruits have underperformed or faded into obscurity as a result of seeing too much too soon.
Conversely, many successful players at the college and professional levels have far exceeded initial recruiters’ expectations. All-Pro linebacker Clay Matthews III was initially a walk-on before joining Cushing and Rey Maualuga to form the famous 2009 triumvirate of pro-bound linebackers. 2012 Biletnikoff Award winner Marqise Lee, who looks like a wide receiver coach’s genetically engineered dream, was initially billed by recruiters as a four-star safety. The recruiting process itself is riddled with flaws and unpredictability, but USC has stayed relevant and successful in the recruiting arena by translating highly touted recruiting classes into on-the-field success and by avoiding placing too much emphasis on any single player (with one notable Heisman-trophy-winning exception).
In summation, a 7-6 season reads more like an aberration than the beginning of a precipitous decline for the Trojan football team. The Trojans are one of two teams who failed to finish in the top 10 in the polls in 2012 with a recruiting class in ESPN’s top 10.
Though coaching is an unpredictable metric, it is presumed that the USC football team will recommence their winning ways come fall with the installation of a new defense more effective at stopping the spread under new coordinator Clancy Pendergast. There will almost certainly be a quarterback controversy next season between Browne and redshirt sophomores Max Wittek and Cody Kessler, but competition in this case could be a good problem. With offensive line recruits from last year’s entering class filling out and Lee and senior running back Silas Redd returning for another season, don’t be too surprised if the Trojans’ vaunted recruiting class pays off big dividends yet again.

Buried beneath the hoopla that is college football’s national signing day is a surprising statistic about another upcoming recruiting class at USC.
The men’s basketball team currently has the No. 34 group of prospects in the country, according to ESPN.
Yes, the team that just fired its coach, sits at 9-13 overall (good for ninth in the Pac-12) and is coming off the worst season in school history has a higher-ranked incoming recruiting class than the Ohio State Buckeyes.
Coming in at No. 34 would be an absolute travesty for USC coach Lane Kiffin and the football team. Even his biggest supporter, Athletic Director Pat Haden, would have no choice but to let him go if the Trojans finished with anything less than a top-10 class in 2013.
But for the basketball program? A top-40 ranking after years of bringing in transfers and dealing with its own sanctions would be a fantastic development for whoever ends up as the next USC coach. Now, the challenge is keeping the new recruits from bolting before basketball signing day. That could be a problem.
The cream of the crop is Kendal Yancy-Harris, the No. 77-ranked player in ESPN’s top-100 list. He’s a hyper-athletic 6-foot-4 point guard from Richardson, Texas who would present the Trojans with a different look at the position after senior Jio Fontan graduates.
The only problem? Yancy-Harris was recently granted a partial release from USC following the dismissal of former USC coach Kevin O’Neill. He’s received offers from more than 10 schools, including the University of Missouri, LSU and Kansas State. Rivals.com reports that USC interim coach Bob Cantu and even Haden have been in contact with the top recruit, and they remain hopeful he’ll stay with the Trojans. If he bolts, the class loses its credibility. USC needs Yancy-Harris as they regroup next season and try to start fresh post-O’Neill.
The Trojans have four other recruits in the fold, including small forward Roschon Prince from Long Beach, Calif. Prince is the No. 21-ranked small forward in his class according to ESPN and, as a resident of Southern California, is an important get for the men’s basketball program. USC has long tried to tap into the basketball hotbed of Los Angeles but has often lagged behind crosstown rival UCLA. Prince isn’t a blue-chip talent, but he fills a need at the forward spot and should be able to contribute in some capacity as a freshman.
Julian Jacobs, a point guard from Las Vegas, Nev., is a similarly ranked player to Prince. He’s the top recruit in the state at his position and chose USC over the likes of Utah, Santa Clara and Saint Mary’s. If Yancy-Harris sticks around, it’s tough to see where Jacobs fits in for the short-term. But there’s no such thing as too much backcourt depth, and Jacobs might end up being thrust into a larger role if Yancy-Harris goes elsewhere.
O’Neill’s influence on the program remains with the last two signed recruits, Nikola Jovanovic and Kahlil Dukes. Never afraid to take a risk, O’Neill brought in a bevy of unknown players during his tenure, including junior forward Dewayne Dedmon. Jovanovic fits that mold as well. Hailing from Serbia, he’s playing his senior season at Arlington Country Day School in Florida this season. ESPN has him pegged as the No. 2 power forward in the state, but his ability to contribute at the next level is still up in the air.
The same applies to Dukes, a shooting guard from Hartford, Conn. Unlike Jovanovic, there’s a strong body of work on his resume. He averaged more than 21 points per game for Capital Prep High School as a junior and led his team to the Class S title game. Even still, he’s listed as a two-star recruit in part because he plays against lesser competition. There are reasons for optimism, though — Detroit Pistons rookie Andre Drummond played at the same high school as Dukes, and he turned out pretty well. And when Dukes had a chance to shine against fellow D-1 opponents in an Amateur Athletic Union tournament in Las Vegas, he dropped 41 points in a single game.
Unless the Trojans lock down another Nick Young or O.J. Mayo, it’s hard to imagine the program getting much attention for its recruiting efforts anytime soon. This year’s class, however, offers a rare glimmer of hope for a team in desperate need of a positive sign for the future. Football is king at USC and national signing day only serves to reaffirm that. But depending on how the class of 2013 shakes out for men’s basketball, USC fans might look back on this group of recruits as the launching point for a new beginning.

The USC men’s golf team returns to action Wednesday, looking to build off of an impressive 2012 campaign. The squad will open the spring season with the three-day Big Island Invitational, played at Waikoloa Golf Course in Waikoloa, Hawaii.

The Trojans, who placed 15th at last year’s NCAA championships, come into the season ranked ninth nationally and with high hopes for the upcoming season. Junior All-American Jeffrey Kang anchors a USC team with a solid mix of youth and experience, and contributions are expected from an array of Trojans. The opening tournament, however, will not be an easy first test: Top collegiate golf programs from around the nation, including Pac-12 rivals No. 11 Stanford, No. 5 Washington and No. 4 UCLA, will be competing on the beautiful Hawaiian links.
The team’s immediate mission will be to stay sharp following a two-month hiatus. The break came after a fall preseason that, according to sophomore Anthony Paolucci, did not live up to the Trojans’ high expectations.
“We didn’t play well in the fall by our standards,” Paolucci said. “But I know all of us are capable of playing much better this spring.”
USC kicked off the fall with the Pac-12 preview hosted by Oregon State, finishing in third place. The conference is expected to be among the nation’s toughest. The Trojans then traveled to Georgia for the U.S. Collegiate Championships, where they again finished third. The squad capped off the fall schedule closer to home with the Gifford Collegiate Championships in San Martin, Calif., where they once again finished third. Expectations for the spring are higher.
“I’m really excited for this spring season,” Paolucci said. “We have a very strong team. I feel like we can make a good run at a national title this year.”
Such a run will be difficult in a loaded Pac-12 conference, which features a top-five squad in No. 3 Cal along with the dangerous Oregon Ducks. The Trojans also have a date with No. 1 Alabama and defending NCAA champion No. 2 Texas in March’s Southern Collegiate Masters. But even with the tough schedule, Paolucci is confident in the team’s chances.
“I know we all are ready to test our game against the best teams in the country,” Paolucci said.
The Trojans will be doing just that this week in Hawaii, where a strong finish could set the tone for the year.

USC is coming into national signing day with what could be one of its most promising recruiting classes in recent history, but many uncertainties remain, especially after a slew of decommits on Tuesday.
USC had eight verbal commitments on Tuesday morning, but that number is down to five after Jalen Ramsey — a five-star cornerback on Rivals.com — and four-star defensive ends Jason Hatcher and Torrodney Prevot informed USC that they will no longer sign with the Trojans.
Pressure is on · Head coach Lane Kiffin is hoping to come away with a top-ten recruiting class when the dust settles on Wednesday. — Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
USC has room for 18 new players this season. Seven players have already enrolled early for the spring, making those players, headed by five-star quarterback Max Browne and five-star safety Su’a Cravens, a lock for the Trojans. For the rest of the recruiting class, nothing is binding until a letter of intent is faxed in today. With five verbal commitments, USC currently has six spots to fill.
After losing both defensive ends in its recruiting class, USC has its eyes set on defensive lineman Eddie Vanderdoes, a five-star recruit who decommitted from the Trojans on Dec. 27.
Vanderdoes, the No. 2-ranked defensive tackle from Placer High, is now considering Alabama, Notre Dame and UCLA alongside USC. He visited Alabama’s campus on Saturday and voiced his satisfaction with the program on Twitter.
Vanderdoes will announce his school choice at 5 p.m. PST.
Four-star outside linebacker Quinton Powell is considered a favorite to sign with USC. Powell, a good friend and former teammate of USC defensive tackle Leonard Williams at Mainland High, had narrowed down his decision to either USC or Florida on his Twitter, but the Gators revoked their scholarship offer to Powell on Saturday.
Powell has extended his options to include South Carolina, Oregon and Miami and will announce his decision on ESPNU at 9:15 a.m.
USC has an outside chance at landing five-star defensive tackle A’Shawn Robinson, who visited USC in December but currently has a verbal commitment with Alabama. Robinson will announce his choice at 12:30 p.m.
The Trojans are also hoping to catch five-star linebacker Matthew Thomas, who visited USC on Jan. 18 and has the Trojans on a list that includes Alabama, Florida State, Georgia and Miami. Thomas will announce his decision on ESPNU at 6:15 a.m.
Ramsey had been committed to the Trojans since July of last year, but the commitment was especially precarious after USC fired defensive backs coach Marvin Sanders in January. He announced his intent to sign with Florida State on Tuesday.
Prevot committed to the Trojans in July 2012, but after favorable visits last week to Texas A&M and Oregon, Prevot will likely sign with either the Aggies or the Ducks.
This is the second time that Hatcher has decommitted from the Trojans in the last two weeks. He first decommitted from the Trojans on Jan. 22 but recommitted to USC on Jan. 29, after hosting an in-home visit with USC coach Lane Kiffin, defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast and receivers coach Tee Martin.
On Tuesday, Hatcher’s mother announced that he will sign with Kentucky.
Along with Hatcher, Prevot, Ramsey and Vanderdoes, USC lost verbal commitments from five-star athlete Max Redfield, four-star defensive end Kylie Fitts and four-star wide receivers Eldridge Massington and Sebastian LaRue. Redfield, Massington and LaRue are currently committed to Notre Dame, UCLA and Texas A&M, respectively.
USC currently has five verbal commits from offensive linemen Nico Falah and Khaliel Rodgers, linebacker Michael Hutchings, wide receiver Steven Mitchell and running back Ty Isaac.
Each player is a four-star recruit aside from Isaac, a five-star recruit. Hutchings, Isaac, Mitchell and Rodgers are considered solid commits.
Hindered by NCAA sanctions until the 2015 season, USC is restricted to offering 15 scholarships a year instead of 25 and can have a total of 75 players on scholarship rather than 85.

A recent trend in the video game industry has been the inclusion of downloadable content, or DLC, to existing titles. People who already own the game can pay a small price in order to access a new feature of a game they might already have completed or grown tired of. These expansions can range from gameplay features — new multiplayer maps, campaigns or game modes — to something purely cosmetic, such as character or weapon skins. More and more games are offering “season passes,” allowing access to all major DLC for a reduced price.
This brings us to the first map pack available for Treyarch’s best-selling game Call of Duty: Black Ops II. Titled Revolution, the $15 map pack features four new multiplayer maps, a new Zombies level and game mode and, for the first time in Call of Duty history, a new multiplayer weapon.
The Zombies map, titled “Die Rise,” has the player holding off a zombie horde on top of a skyscraper. Various staircases and elevators around the map provide perks, upgrades and ways to get from level to level. Additionally, Treyarch has added some new weapons to provide even more variety to the experience. “Turned,” the new four-player Zombies game mode, has three people playing as zombies, tasked with killing the one human player to transform back into a human. The player who is the human receives points as long as he remains the human, and each kill by the human switches the current weapon.
“Die Rise” provides the most enjoyable and exhilarating zombie experiences so far on Black Ops II. The emphasis on verticality adds a whole new strategy to zombie killing, and it offers the most in terms of upgrades out of all the maps in the game.
But though “Turned” provides an entertaining diversion from the core Zombies experience, it ultimately gets repetitive as the human ends up sitting on the edge of the map waiting for the Zombies to rush him. The weapon swapping between kills can also lead to a lot of unnecessary deaths; bum-rushing, not teamwork, seems to be the best method of success for the zombies.
The four multiplayer maps featured in the DLC are “Downhill,” “Grind,” “Hydro” and “Mirage.” “Downhill” takes place in a French ski resort and features gondolas traveling around the map that kill any player they hit. “Grind” is set in a skate park in Venice Beach — complete with ramps, halfpipes and the most vibrant color palette of any map in the game. “Hydro,” meanwhile, takes place at a dam and allows players to activate the water flow, cutting off certain parts of the map and killing players in its path. “Mirage” takes place in the desert and features a central building surrounded by debris and various power positions.
The multiplayer maps provide a breath of fresh air to Black Ops II, featuring a lot more color than the original maps as well as the first snow and desert maps in the game. They’re really well-designed and help maintain the arcade-style, fast-paced gameplay Call of Duty is known for. They’re certainly not the maps a player would want to skip every time they pop up, though “Grind” is arguably the most entertaining of the four.
Finally, the map pack comes with the first downloadable gun ever in Call of Duty, the Peacekeeper. The weapon is an assault rifle/submachine gun hybrid, combining the mobility of submachine guns with the medium-range lethality of the assault rifles. Though it might sound over-powered, Treyarch did an excellent job balancing the gun for competitive play, making the gun feel powerful and fun to use without feeling cheap. Players without the DLC can still pick up and use the Peacekeeper, but will be unable to unlock camouflage and attachments for the Create-A-Class mode.
 
It’s likely that hardcore Call of Duty players who own an Xbox have already purchased the map pack. If one is on the fence about it, however, or plays on a PS3 or PC (PS3 and PC players will get the map pack on Feb. 28), one shouldn’t be. For $15, it is well worth purchasing the Revolution map pack, as it is arguably the best map pack released in a Call of Duty game to date and sets even higher expectations for future Call of Duty DLCs. The multiplayer and Zombie maps are better than most of the maps that came with the game, the “Turned” game mode provides an enjoyable diversion from killing waves of zombies and the Peacekeeper rifle is an excellent addition to the Black Ops II arsenal.

Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue — that combination has worked for ages for weddings, so why shouldn’t it work for music?
In many ways, the most creative artists marry concepts to create a harmonious union of an old sound with a new style. This notion of charting new territory was reinforced last week with the release of various mixtapes. Whether it’s Jim James branching out from his usual My Morning Jacket territory, Paul Banks going hip-hop-commando in what is possibly the most amazing act of randomness in the last few years or a refreshing taste of the Spit that is Alexander, inspirations, original production, derived beats and retro rock are the trappings for the melodious weddings of the music-forward.
Of course, in true music form, these trappings have been tweaked to represent something bold, something “who?!”, something inspired, and something Blood Red.
Jim James: Regions of Light and Sound of God
My Morning Jacket has been tripping us out for about 15 years with its unique brand of Pink-Floyd-goes-Kentucky psychedelic rock. Frontman James released his second solo album this week, and thanks to NPR’s “First Listen” series, the nine-song album was made available for streaming beforehand. The album Regions of Light and Sound of God is inspired by Lynd Ward’s God’s Man, a 1929 woodcut art novel that tells the dark tale of an artist who is tricked into a contract that Mephistopheles would be hella proud of.
James’ first album, Tribute To (2009), was a collection of George Harrison and Beatles covers, which he put out under the super mysterious moniker of “Yim Yames.” In Regions of Light, however, James brings all of his talents to the table, considering he penned every lyric, recorded every instrument and produced the entire album all on his own.
It is because of this that the album branches out from My Morning Jacket territory and, as a whole, allows the audience to appreciate James, uncut, through his philosophical anxieties mixed against fresh and pleasing melodies and beats.
Alexander Spit: A Breathtaking Trip to That Otherside
One of the Bay Area’s finest unknowns in the underground rap scene, L.A.-based Alexander Spit parlays his easy West Coast flow into futuristic and original beats, which shun the flashy, excessive sounds of mainstream rap in A Breathtaking Trip to That Otherside.
Proving he’s just as talented a producer as he is a rapper, Spit varies his backdrops, taking the album from the eerie, trip-hoppy beats of the title track to the confident rhythm of “GREAT SCOTT!!!,”  all the way to the controlled chaos in “Ride.” If there’s such a thing as rap noir, Spit is definitely flirting with it here, using dystopias, social commentaries and an overall anti-hero ambiance. The notion of creating an atmosphere for each tune seems to be of just as much importance to Spit as it was to famous film noir director Robert Siodmak when he created pitch-perfect dark atmospheres in virtually every one of his movie scenes. Featuring appearances from Alchemist, E-40, MFN Exquire and Bago, A Breathtaking Trip is a refreshing taste of underground hip-hop that sets the stage for Spit’s future endeavors.
 
Blood Red Shoes: Water EP
Brighton rockers Blood Red Shoes have nearly perfected its version of the indie alt-rock sound. The band became the new big thing in indie with the release of its tertiary 2012 record, In Time to Voices. The lauded album, rooted in atmospheric melodies, showcased the duo’s comfort in its growing sound, which was presumed to be the band’s signature style. In Water, though, Blood Red Shoes decide to ditch the soft, gentle balance of its sound that made up In Time to Voices and just go full out rock-and-roll. No longer is the duo dancing around you, trying to get your attention — instead, they’re using a metaphorical guitar-shaped pan to whack you over the head to get you to notice them. The EP is much louder and more distorted than the band’s usual tunes, and though the sound works for the band overall, there are times that the duo sound like some reject metal-wannabe band from the late ’90s. The record was apparently inspired while driving around America, so there’s that for an explanation.
 
Paul Banks: Everybody On My Dick Like They Supposed To Be
Yes, you read that right. Paul Banks, as in Paul Banks of Interpol, has decided to drop the whole precious-British-mopester act and reveal his true self — a down-ass G. This mixtape, which has apparently been in the works for the last nine months, was originally supposed to be included as a pre-release bonus for his solo album released last year entitled Banks. The Interpol frontman hinted that his hip-hop liasoning would happen in a recent Spin interview: “I was listening to a lot of Drake when I was recording [Banks], but that was once all the songs were written,” he told the music magazine. “I took hip-hop songs to [co-producer] Peter [Katis] [and] said, ‘Check this out.’ But he’s not into hip-hop. A lot of times he’d be looking at me like, ‘Why the f-ck are you playing me this?’”
It’s not a bad question. One definitely doesn’t think of hip-hop when Paul Banks comes to mind, but still, in an act of brilliant randomness, Banks has somehow managed to give himself some serious credibility in the hip-hop world through this mixtape. It doesn’t seem as though Banks is doing any rapping himself — he’s mostly just acting like a hipster Dr. Dre, producing beats for guest rappers such as Talib Kweli, El P and Mike G. The worst part of all of this? The mixtape is insanely good. Like, insanely good. Um … thanks, Drake?

Back in 1999, an endearing pair of twins released their first album. The release, chock-full of romantic trials and tribulations, immediately marked Tegan and Sara Quin of Tegan and Sara as an emotionally insightful and sonically unique addition to the music scene.

The band’s quirky harmonies, heart-tugging lyrics and cutesy melodies instantly spawned a fan base that has supported the ascent of the twin sisters up to their most recent release, Heartthrob.
Yet that uniqueness doesn’t come through in this mixed-bag release, which gives some credit to the age-old argument that an artist’s older material sometimes surpasses newer creations. The twins did not make their name sounding just like everyone else, and while some of the tracks feel like bonafide Tegan and Sara of old, others feel less distinguishable from mainstream love tunes.
Heartbroken listeners accustomed to therapeutic tracks from Tegan and Sara will still get plenty of solid songs on this album — but, the sentiment sometimes feels more cliche than usual in this new exploration. “I Was a Fool” sounds exactly what the title suggests it will sound like, with the chorus repeating the title, drawing out the word “fool” for dramatic emphasis. The gist of the song is that the narrator is feeling like a fool because of some sort of failed love venture — a classic subject matter for any love song.
The certain Tegan and Sara twist that takes a classic idea and mixes it up is plainly missing from the song, though. In previous albums and well-known tracks — take for instance “Where Does the Good Go” and “Back In Your Head” — the duo uses the same type of repetition, but through less-obvious phrasing and with an intriguing blend of the sisters’ respective voices.
Tegan and Sara knows how to strip songs down to their emotional cores both musically and lyrically, but with “I Was a Fool,” the song unnecessarily drags out in the chorus and never reaches an emotional peak, fading out instead of ending on a more purposeful note.
The duo also experiments with a more ’80s, New Wave sound in the album, utilizing plenty of synthesizers sprinkled throughout the tracks. “How Come You Don’t Want Me” basically creates a chorus around a set of questions — “Why don’t you wanna win me now / Why don’t you wanna show me off?” — that make the entire track feel very retro with just a hint of Tegan and Sara’s personality in the vocals.
The song repeats these passionate inquiries until the bridge, which presents the questions in a slower form in case they still haven’t gotten through to the listener. Though it might be brutal listening for anyone on the receiving end,  for a jilted listener, the song’s soothing lines might provide some comfort. Thankfully, the duo’s characteristically saccharine voices keep the song light, making it one of the sweetest-sounding neurotic onslaughts of questions.
That sweetness carries on into the more risque “Closer,” an electronically infused tune about the speaker’s mischievous desire to get more intimate with an object of affection. Short electronic notes layered together guide the song along until the chorus, which blossoms into a fuzz of electronic notes perfectly balanced with a crisp snare beat. That part of the song becomes immediately infectious, especially as it repeats the sentiment “I won’t treat you like you’re oh-so-typical.”
Yet other tracks on the album feel unfortunately typical. “Drove Me Wild” includes some nice details about a certain lover, but the chorus “And you drove me / And you drove me / And you drove me wild” feels a little empty. The verses seem more genuine than the chorus, which ultimately subtracts from the authenticity of the track. “Now I’m all Messed Up” somehow does the same; the verses include heart-wrenching lines like “Stay / You’ll leave me in the morning anyway” while the chorus starts with the strange pairing of the phrases “Now I’m All messed up / Sick and tired of wondering where you’re leaving your makeup.” Yet the duo makes up for the chorus with the end of the song, which tests the listener’s emotional stamina; the word “go” gets woven in with a more high-pitched plead of “please stay.” The twins know what they are doing and they are able to capture a relatable hysteria so well through this repetition.
Tegan and Sara ends the album with a redeeming song, “Shock to Your System,” that directly addresses any melancholic listeners. A simple yet prominent drum beat, sprinkled with piano and synthesizer sounds, manages to merge well with the clever lines “You got a shock to your system / Pull yourself out of it / I know that shock to your system / Knocked your heart right out of sync.” The song ups the emotional stakes with the phrase “What you are is lonely.” No current musical duo could deliver that line more gently.
Ultimately, this is what will keep fans coming back to Tegan and Sara. Though the act superficially sounds a little less like the idiosyncratic Tegan and Sara of past years, the genuine effort to share the tinge of romantic complications stays intact. Heartthrob does not feel like the duo’s best, but it proves the duo’s knack for taking the edge off heartbreak.

Anton Chekhov most likely never imagined that his play Three Sisters would still be performed in 2013 — not to mention with the addition of elements such as barbershop quartets and disco music.

He might be rolling in his grave, but the Theatre Movement Bazaar has put together a newly imagined performance of Chekhov’s characters, entitled Track 3, currently playing at the Bootleg Theater. The show seamlessly integrates original text and new dialogue, as well as song and dance numbers to create a riff on Chekhov’s timeless story.
Track 3 tells the watered-down story of three sisters, Olga (Kendra Chell), Irina (Caitlyn Conlin) and Masha (Dylan Jones). Their father died a year ago in the story, and they still struggle with living in the small town their parents forced them to move to. All they dream of is moving back to the cosmopolitan center of Moscow. Eventually, their brother, Andrei (Mark Skeens) is introduced, along with his wife Natasha (Liz Vital), who wants to take over the family home of the sisters. The 90-minute production follows the sisters and their interactions with Andrei, Natasha and their soldier friends as the sisters come to terms with what their life has become.
This extremely creative production does a fine job of communicating the basic story of the original play while still adding its own artistic flair. Made obvious by its name, Track 3 is based primarily on movement. Though the story follows the original text, the production includes interludes of stylized movements, musical numbers and dances. The director and choreographer, Tina Kronis, has no limit to the direction she takes the movement: The play incorporates everything from a barbershop quartet to disco music.
The show opens with the three sisters standing in a triangular shape at the front of the playing space. They take turns leaning toward each other, slowly moving through various poses and effectively convincing the audience that these are not normal people. They appear strange and socially awkward, as their obsession with moving back to Moscow takes over their entire beings.
A particularly fun moment involves the actors becoming a Russian band for a short scene and, just as quickly, abandoning their accordions, guitars, cymbals and wind instruments. Another number features a choreographed dance around the tables complete with singing, dancing, confetti-throwing, music and strobe lights. These moments are oddly fascinating and unpredictable, as each creative choice surprises the audience. The actors employ such a wide range of movement and music that they remain entertaining throughout the show and never seem contrite.
This piece revolves around not only movement, but also a sense of an ensemble. All of the actors share a similar load of stage time and responsibilities as they work together to create the various musical moments. Members of the ensemble do an excellent job of establishing and communicating their characters through minimal dialogue, relying instead on body language and subtle looks.
The complicated movement is complemented with a minimalist set, which comprises only tables, chairs and a stand-alone fireplace mantle. The actors often incorporate the set into their routines, moving the tables in a synchronized dance. The production also does not use any backstage space; instead, the actors sit in chairs against the wall of the stage, completely exposed to the audience as they await their entrance.
When an actor has a costume change, the rest of the ensemble stands around him while he or she changes. This adds to the creative nature of the production and makes the space very intimate, allowing the audience to feel a stronger connection to the performance.
Though most of the costumes are practical, modern-day outfits, the three sisters each feature an odd headpiece. A combination of feathers, hair, fabric and other materials, the headpieces gives them a bird-like, hoarder look, reminiscent of the women of Grey Gardens. One of these tall hats comes with a long raccoon-like tail, another with dog-ear-like tufts of hair and yet another with stacks of different colored hair. The rest of their outfits are fairly normal, but these elements bring the production further into the absurd and nicely complement the actors’ odd movements.
Though this play is strange, unique and crazy at times, the characters are still true to the emotions of these poor sisters. If nothing else, it allows the actors to explore the emotions more fully by communicating them through movement and song. At the end of the play, when the sisters each come to their own conclusions about their lives, it is shocking that this silly bunch of actors are able to portray such somber moments well.
Track 3  is a wonderfully creative show, if not a bit wacky. The Theater Movement Bazaar’s interpretation of the text is fascinating and makes for a very enjoyable evening of theater.
 
Track 3 plays through Feb. 10 at the Bootleg Theater in Los Angeles.

The USC men’s volleyball team continues on its three game road trip Wednesday night with an important match against the No. 10 Cal State Northridge Matadors.
Despite early wins against the top two teams in the nation, UC Irvine and Stanford, the Trojans have struggled as of late, coming off consecutive losses to Pacific and Pepperdine. USC faces another tough challenger in the Matadors, who have defeated the likes of UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara.
This season, the Trojans have attempted to adjust to a young but talented roster. In fact, USC has featured four different starting lineups in their first four road games and fans can expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future.
“Until we get a little more consistency from our left side attackers and our outside hitters, we will continue to see different guys in there,” head coach Bill Ferguson said.
It isn’t all doom and gloom for Ferguson though, who has seen some strong play from others on the roster.
“We seem to be solid at opposite but Tanner [Jensen] has had a couple down games,” Ferguson said. “[Robert] Feathers and [Ben] Lam, for the most part, have been doing very well and Josh Kirchner has been great when he’s come in. So we feel pretty good there. It’s mainly just the outside hitting position that’s been up and down.”
With sophomore Joey Booth returning this week from a recent ankle sprain and All-American Libero Henry Cassiday soon to follow, the Trojans can be sure to expect even more changes to the lineup.
“Its always good to have an All-American come back,” Ferguson said.
Consistency has been the biggest struggle for the Trojans, as was seen throughout their game against No. 4 Pepperdine. The team hit a disappointing .208 and was out-dug by the Waves 28-22. Nevertheless, the Trojans were successful at the net and were able to out-block Pepperdine, a team known for its prowess in that department.
“We out-blocked them 16-6 and that was a phenomenal night in that category,” Ferguson said. “The issue was that we weren’t solid and sound on defense in the back row and that is something that we’ve hung our hat on year after year.”
Now USC will take the short road trip to face Cal State Northridge in one of the most lively crowd atmospheres in men’s volleyball. Led by junior outside hitter Brandon Lebrock, the Matadors enter the game hungry for a win after nearly knocking off top ranked BYU on Saturday. While Cal State has had little success in recent years against the Trojans, Ferguson is not taking them lightly.
“They’re always a really tough team at home,” Ferguson said. “It’s one of the better environments in the league to play in. They get a ton of good fan support and they’re really well coached. [Coach] Jeff Campbell does a really good job with those guys year in and year out.”
The Trojans may own a less-than-stellar 2-3 mark, but sophomore co-captain Micah Christenson knows their record does not reflect the potential of this team.
“Every team in the league is so strong this year that anybody can beat anybody, as has been evident so far,” Christenson said. “We’ve had some great wins against some very good teams and also some bad losses, but we’re getting better day by day.”
The Trojans will square off against the Matadors at Cal State Northridge tonight at 7:00 p.m. before continuing on their road trip to face Long Beach State Friday night.

National security threats often invoke images of bombs, guns and invading military forces, but one of the most pressing threats to the United States involves none of these things. Instead, powers hostile to the United States and its interests have quietly launched domestic cyberterrorism attacks against U.S. banks and, most recently, against popular American news agencies. Such subtle acts of espionage, and the likelihood that they will only become more damaging, translates into a dire need for Congress to quickly pass legislation that beefs up cybersecurity defenses.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
The issue of cybersecurity came to the forefront of national discourse last Wednesday, when The New York Times revealed that they had fallen victim to a four-month-long network security breach that was reported to have originated in China. The initial breach occurred around Oct. 25, 2012, the publication date of an article reporting on the family of the country’s prime minister. This disturbing news was followed by revelations that The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg News and The Washington Post experienced similar issues within their own networks.
The fact that unfriendly powers are carrying out such breaches against institutions of free speech is unsettling enough, but the threats extend beyond mere invasions of privacy. Large attacks were leveled in September against the online systems of JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank and PNC Bank, resulting in at least daylong denials of service.
Such attacks indicate that much more is at stake, with some especially problematic areas being not only economic institutions and tech firms but also power grids for nuclear power plants and water purification systems. “Nation-state attackers will target critical infrastructure networks such as power grids at an unprecedented scale in 2013  . . . These types of attacks could grow more sophisticated, and the slippery slope could lead to the loss of human life,” said Chiranjeev Bordoloi, CEO of security company Top Patch.
According to a CNN interview with James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, at least 12 of the world’s largest military powers are working to construct complicated cyberwarfare systems.
It would be no stretch to say that the United States has the most to lose at the hands of these powers if our government continues to put cybersecurity on the backburner.
Though the media’s constant bombardment of the public with images of war-ravaged Afghanistan would suggest otherwise, the events in a remote desert nation do not necessarily pose a greater threat to national security than seemingly less dangerous cyberattacks. The recent infiltrations should remind our legislators of this and prompt them to not only engage in serious discussion with other nations such as China, but also quickly pass legislation that would re-allocate substantial defense resources to building a stronger cyberdefense system.
Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) spoke to the immediacy of the situation in an interview with Politico: “Foreign cyberattackers are targeting every aspect of the American economy every day and Congress needs to act with urgency to protect our national security and our economy,” he said.
With the defense budget and looming sequestration cuts up for debate, Congress needs to take advantage of an opportunity for bipartisan cooperation. Instead of continuing partisan bickering on troop withdrawals and timetables, lawmakers must work to pass serious legislation that will provide the tools necessary to combat lurking cyberthreats.
Attacks on public utilities and power plants can create not only inconvenient but dangerous situations for everyday Americans, and the crash of a bank’s computer system can wreak economic havoc. In addition, some of the nation’s most sensitive intelligence information could be discretely collected and used against us in unexpected attacks.
Aggression in cyberspace is unfortunately a product of our times, truly illustrating both the magic and terror that modern technology can bring. As such, our leaders must act so that we are prepared for whatever comes our way. Technological capacities will only continue to grow as time passes, and as nations unfriendly to the United States develop economically and politically, the possibility of more serious attacks will only increase. Constructing a stronger defense in U.S. cyberspace is of paramount importance, and waiting longer could only harm the nation — the time for action is now.

When one begins the admissions process at USC, parents and high school students are shoved packets of information about how many majors and minors our university offers. USC’s website encourages students to “add a minor or a second major to their academic programs” and become a more well-rounded and informed individual. There is even the Renaissance Scholar Prize for students with the most opposite double-major or major-minor combinations. And for many students at USC, double majoring or picking up a minor is as normal and easy as attempting to remember your ABCs.
But for others, specifically students in the Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, an attempt to take multiple classes outside of their respective disciplines is more difficult than advertised.
The USC Office of Admission encourages students who are not married to a major to enter undecided. This plops unsure students in Dornsife. The Dornsife College Advising Office recommends taking GEs and some classes that suit the student’s interests until a major is declared, since it’s required that majors are declared by the end of 64 units. So there’s plenty of time to take classes that seem interesting. Right?
At USC, students generally take 128 units in their four years. And though that might seem like more than enough to double major with a minor, Dornsife, in particular, has requirements that eat up those units. With the six GEs, two writing courses and three language courses required of all students, the number of electives one can take falls dramatically.
Majors vary in requirements, and only certain combinations are feasible within four years. Interested in double majoring in environmental studies and psychology? Consider summer school for those extra two classes, or pay for extra units. Scheduling and planning becomes way more difficult than need be.
Thus, a minor becomes a better option. Dual interests can be explored without the unit requirements of double majors. However, without a double major, Dornsife has a 104-unit minimum requirement for classes completed within the liberal arts school if that is a student’s sole degree. If they have a minor or second bachelor’s degree, then that mandatory number drops to 96 units. That means a student will have just a handful of classes to take outside of Dornsife. If several classes were taken freshman year that don’t fill a requirement, however, the option for interdisciplinary studies becomes increasingly difficult.
Not to mention many majors or minors outside Dornsife (within the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism or the Marshall School of Business, for example) require applications that are only available at certain dates. Deciding to apply after the deadline prevents the student from taking classes that fulfill major requirements.
Is exploring multiple interests possible at USC? Certainly. In many combinations, it might be easy. However, Dornsife hardly encourages multidisciplinary learning with its language, general education and major requirements.
If introductory classes were two units instead of four, students could explore multiple interests freshman year while loading up on GEs. Dornsife should completely eliminate the requirement that a certain number of classes be taken within the college, since it seemingly encourages students to take electives instead of perusing a minor that can be built into a practical skill.
Major requirements should be lowered, at the very least for students with double majors. In addition, barriers between the schools should be lowered. The application process allows for only qualified students to switch majors, and that’s fair. However, applications should be accepted year-round.
Finally, students should be able to audit courses without it taking from their units. Auditing allows students to explore a subject minus the commitment.
Until changes are met, advisers must notify students of the restrictions before they build their first schedules. Though the advice to pursue all classes that seem interesting is lovely, it might prevent students from actually being able to complete degrees in the areas they eventually choose.
