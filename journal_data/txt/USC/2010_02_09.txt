Undergraduate Student Government presidential candidate Jonathan Munoz-Proulx and his running mate Ryan Walsh are hoping to increase the efficiency of Campus Cruiser, open Doheny library 24 hours a day during finals, make student football tickets transferable and better promote student organizations.

Munoz-Proulx, a junior majoring in theatre, and Walsh, a sophomore majoring in computer science, are the only executive candidates who have never held elected office in USG. They are hoping to win office to help improve students’ experiences at USC.
“I would love for the opportunity to spend my last year here working 20 hours a week doing nothing but making this experience as great for everyone as it has been for me,” Munoz-Proulx said.
Despite their lack of USG experience, Munoz-Proulx said they are not “overwhelmed or intimidated” because they believe their work experiences, including serving as orientation advisors, are a great strength.
Munoz-Proulx is a tour guide and sits on the USG Campus Affairs and University Affairs Committee. Walsh has been a business and house manager for engineering fraternity Sigma Phi Delta.
Instead of focusing on experience, the two are running a campaign based on research and preparation. They have, for example, been researching other schools’ student governments and attending Senate meetings.
“Whatever experience we don’t have, we’re doing everything to make up for that,” Munoz-Proulx said. “We wouldn’t have gone through all this work if we didn’t think we had a competitive chance at being elected.”
The pair has been looking into Harvard, Columbia and other private universities to learn about their student governments.
“It’s not until you start researching other schools that you see what’s really possible,” Munoz-Proulx said.
For example, he proposes copying Stanford University’s “green student store” by having either an online store available during the summer or a booth during move-in week selling environmentally-friendly items like soap, cups and power strips.
Encouraging turning off unused lights, installing solar panels and replacing energy-draining laundry machines are on the platform as well.
The duo said its most valuable research has come from talking to students, and it thinks its knowledge of the issues important to students will help it in the campaign.
“I’ve heard prospective students and what they want out of a university, admitted students and why they matriculate to USC, and we’ve been learning about current students from four to five meetings a day with student leaders,” Munoz-Proulx said.
Walsh said most of their ideas have been developed from student voices, including those he encounters through playing sports such as club rugby and driving for Campus Cruiser.
Walsh believes an automated voice or text cancellation service would make Campus Cruiser more efficient. Currently, students must wait up to 15 minutes for an operator to cancel cruisers, which are required to wait five minutes for students.
“A cancellation line would actually free up those cars that are wasting their time there waiting,” Walsh said. “I’d say we waste about two man-hours waiting for people that never show up.”
Residing outside of Campus Cruiser’s western service boundary, Munoz-Proulx sees demand for increased security west of campus.
He wants to develop a professional security escort service that extends past the boundary, so “everyone can have a safe ride home.”
Another top goal is to increase contact with students via a weekly e-mail newsletter that would have bullet points of what USG is working on and a poster outside of the new student center to promote weekly events.
“[Student leaders] have told us that a lot of advertising for events for students organizations aren’t about, for example, rugby games or lacrosse games or anything like that, so they’d really like to be better represented by USG,” Walsh said.
He noted communication issues with the Greek community too. Instead of relying on Greek senators and councils, Walsh wants direct contact with fraternity and sorority presidents.
Munoz-Proulx said he envisions small improvements in academics, such as opening Doheny Memorial Library 24 hours a day during finals week to remedy the lack of study space and posting online the teacher evaluations completed at semester’s end.
“Students already fill out these evaluations, so why not make them available?” he said.
Regarding meal plans, Munoz-Proulx said that for students living at Fluor Tower — which isn’t near either of the dining halls — meals aren’t as effective as dining dollars. He suggested either creating the “Trojan Light” plan — a compromise between the Cardinal plan and the Trojan plan that has been discussed previously — or not requiring a meal plan. He also recommended, similar to the Community plan, the ability for students to use meals for guests.
Another proposal calls for the ability to transfer football tickets between two USCard holders or to donate tickets to local schoolchildren.
According to Munoz-Proulx, wasting tickets “hurts the university because they’re not making money, hurts the Coliseum because they aren’t selling as many concessions and hurts the students because not as many students can see games.”
Walsh said he wants to pressure professors to offer extra credit alternatives to the Joint Educational Project, which allows students to mentor at local schools but fills up quickly.
Another point on their platform is offering free HIV testing in the health center all year instead of in February only.
Jeff Toye, an undeclared sophomore and the designer of the campaign’s logo that features Munoz-Proulx’s initials “J.M.P.” within a patriotically colored Trojan helmet, said the candidates can reach all Trojans.
“They are a real opportunity to make a difference on campus because they have the great ideas, like [all] candidates do, but also the determination and drive to get those done,” he said.

This year’s Dance Marathon could suffer dramatic cutbacks if the Undergraduate Student Senate does not approve a request for funding at next week’s Senate meeting.
Dance Marathon is a student-run philanthropic event with proceeds going to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. The first Dance Marathon at USC was held two years ago at the Ground Zero Performance Café. Since then, it has moved to the Lyon Center because of the increase in participants and the growth of the event.
Suzanne Fitzgerald, executive director of Dance Marathon, presented a plea for funding at Tuesday night’s Senate meeting. The funding, she said, is necessary to allow the Dance Marathon to be at the scale its organizers intended.
Dance Marathon requested $5,000 from the Senate, but Fitzgerald said they are actually about $8,000 short of their projected budget of $9,429.85.
The Dance Marathon organizers had anticipated receiving a sizable amount from USG’s discretionary funding board, as they have every year. The discretionary funding board, however, has rules that say it is not allowed to fund student organizations that are not open to every student, including those that charge an entrance fee.
Though Dance Marathon does not charge an entrance fee, they do charge $15 for a T-shirt and food when participants register. The discretionary funding board, Fitzgerald said, interpreted this as an entrance fee.
“We didn’t make it clear enough that it’s not an entrance fee,” Fitzgerald said.
Because that funding fell through, Dance Marathon organizers have turned to the Senate, which operates independently from the discretionary funding board.
The organizers presented to the Senate on Tuesday, and senators then debated the request and asked specific questions about how the funds have been used and what other routes have been considered.
Senators also discussed the amount of money available in the Senate allocations fund. If the request is granted, it will account for 32 percent of the money currently in the fund, USG Vice President Ashlie Chan said during the meeting.
The Senate will vote on the request next week. Chan said it is hard to say if the vote will pass because concrete numbers will not be presented until the next meeting.
“It sounds like [the Senate] really wants to fund it, but it depends on the debate we’re having next week,” Chan said.
If they don’t receive the necessary funding, the Dance Marathon will be changed dramatically, organizers said. The length, the aesthetics and the quality of the event will all be diminished, they said.
“We would scale back dramatically to where we would have a small stage and a couple of speakers in the Lyon Center,” Fitzgerald said. “It would be a bare-minimum event, with no decorations. It would be not as entertaining and not as fun and just wouldn’t be the experience that we’re looking to create for everyone who walks in on Feb. 27.”
David Shu, Dance Marathon’s director of finances, said the event looks to expand every year, but that will be impossible this year without help from USG.
“We’re trying to make each step significantly bigger,” Shu said. “We have a pretty big goal. Penn State has a dance marathon too, and they raise over $6 million. We’re slowly trying to work ourselves up to as big as that. If we didn’t receive funding, then it’s going to be a huge step back.”
Last year, Dance Marathon raised $14,000.
Dance Marathon organizers said they have done everything in their power to receive funding, but they are running out of options.
“We’re already maximizing our fundraising and seeking sponsorships. We can’t do much more there,” Shu said. “The only thing we can do is ask the Senate. There’s no one else on campus.”
Such a short memory… I personally helped organize 4 back to back dance marathons between 1994 and 1998, also benefiting CHLA.   Back then, it capped the Greek Week festivities.

Looking at the line of 200 students waiting to sign up for the Joint Educational Project, one might be surprised by the number of students wanting to volunteer — until finding out that many of them are getting class credit.
Giving and receiving · Anne-Marie White, a freshman majoring in theatre, works with students at Vermont Avenue Elementary School as part of the Joint Educational Project. More than 200 students signed up for JEP this semester. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
Both JEP and the Teaching for International Relations Program (TIRP) offer volunteer opportunities that give USC students a chance to teach and tutor at local schools. Both programs also give many students the opportunity to earn extra credit in certain classes.
“Many students come in for extra credit, especially if their class is perceived to be difficult,” said Tammy Anderson, executive director of JEP.
Though requirements vary, professors often offer extra credit for students who complete a certain number of hours with JEP or TIRP and fulfill certain requirements, sometimes including essays or journal entries.
Steven Lamy, founder of TIRP and professor of the International Relations: Introductory Analysis (IR210) class, offered his students 10 points in assignment credit for participation in TIRP. Students were required to act as “teachers” for high school classes four times a semester, submitting reports on lesson plans and meeting with TIRP staff periodically.
Anderson said some professors mandate JEP in their classes, and, looking at TIRP’s 2010 sign-up list, only five of the 168 students had left the “course credit” line blank.
One student, Josue Martinez-Oliva, a junior majoring in international relations, explained that he originally signed up for credit, but the program offered him much more than a better grade.
“It’s one of the most interesting, challenging and right down incredible experiences,” he said.
Martinez-Oliva also said that the extra credit was insignificant in the long run.
“If you do your work, the points don’t really make too much of a difference,” he said. “To see that little bright light spark in the kids’ eyes, that is the reward.”
Anderson said she does not mind that most students sign up to receive course credit because they end up invested in the program for different reasons.
“That’s the initial incentive, but that’s never bothered me because once they’re in the program they say they really enjoy it,” she said.
Both JEP and TIRP have seen significant increases in enrollment over the past few years. This year, spots went particularly quickly.
“The sign-ups that usually go on a week were gone the first day,” said Teresa Hudock, director of the Center for Active Learning in International Studies, the organization that manages TIRP. “[The students] felt more enthusiasm from certain professors.”
Lamy said he thinks the reason for the growth in these volunteer programs is because the values of the student body are changing.
“The kind of student that USC is attracting [now] is a kid that is very smart and they can do really well in their classes, but they’re also proud of who they are as students,” Lamy said.
Lamy said about 80 percent of his students who enroll in TIRP still do the required coursework in addition to being “TIRP-ers.”
“In some ways, they realize the best way to learn is to teach someone else,” Lamy said.
I remember reading that poignant story about the young man, who is now in his early 30’s, who felt so compelled to  look up his JEP mentor like 20 years later to express his gratitude. He explained that his JEP mentor took him to Disneyland in Anaheim, CA with her own resources, and that he would have never experienced that in his youth had she not demonstrated her altruism. Today he has his own children, lives in Florida and takes his children to Disney World in Florida once a year.

Sunday was a day of firsts.
The Saints won Super Bowl XLIV, the broadcast became the highest rated television show of all time, and CBS aired a new show after the game called Undercover Boss.
Undercover Boss is a CBS reality show in which a CEO or company executive goes undercover as a lowly, entry-level employee followed by cameramen acting as though he is shooting a documentary on that particular job. The first episode, which aired immediately after the Saints’ victory, featured Waste Management President and Chief Operating Officer Larry O’Donnell working as a newly-hired trash man for his own company.
Larry worked at several jobs ranging from picking up trash on a hill with a hand pike, office work and driving a city trash truck route. In all of the situations, none of the employees were aware that he was from upper management. Larry had real conversations with his temporary co-workers. He experienced the challenges of their daily tasks and learned the real effects of management policies — often policies he implemented.
From this experience, Larry changed as a person. He changed in how he related to people and in his managerial perspective. He suddenly understood from their point of view and could identify with his employees. Larry spent some difficult days in the shoes of his employees and as a result could no longer make a decision without thinking about how it would affect his lower echelon colleagues.
We can all become better businessmen and businesswomen, better leaders and better people by living and experiencing life from as many perspectives as possible.
Students tend to leave school here at USC and go on to be leaders in the world. There is a perception that we come from upper class families and move on to high-level, high-pay and high-prestige positions in society, evading most financial struggles.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
While I am very grateful we have bountiful opportunities to pursue our dreams as they relate to our careers and otherwise, there is something truly admirable about the people who work jobs that we never consider a remote possibility for ourselves just to provide for the family.
Huey Long, a maintenance worker at USC in the Von KleinSmid Center, is one of my heroes.
Long has been working maintenance at USC for 28 years. Every time I see him near VKC performing his job well, he greets people and always has a smile. He spreads joy infectiously. Yet his job is something we hardly glance at, as if it doesn’t even exist. We are disconnected from occupations that many consider menial, particularly those that require no education.
But those who work these jobs are human beings, living lives, raising families and trying to contribute to society. And the services they provide are crucial to business and daily life. Imagine what the nicest of hotels would look like with grungy bathrooms. Imagine dining halls without food service employees. Imagine the public transit system without bus drivers.
Operations across the board would fail. Yet we forget to honor the individuals who work these jobs, keep our workplaces operable, our classrooms teachable and our luxury amenities luxurious. Worse yet, we not only forget to honor these individuals, we often dishonor them with a lesser-than-us attitude.
O’Donnell lived a few tough days in his employees’ shoes. Before his experiences with the show, he focused entirely on efficiency — enacting policies to cut costs, increase revenue and quality control. He was detached from the employees he is obligated to serve. After his experience, O’Donnell could no longer consider actions by numbers and costs only, but by people.
People aren’t just numbers. Everyone has a story. As we Trojans move out into the real world, let’s never forget that. The truest of leaders are leaders who honor both those who work hard in high-paid positions and those whom society overlooks in low-paid positions. If we walk in the shoes of people like Long, we will not forget them. Next time you see someone doing a necessary task, ask him how he is doing or how his day is going, and thank him for what he does. Let’s take advantage of those opportunities to know their story.

As an Employee of Facilities Management Services in the Plumbing shop I for one appreciate the comments of the author. We are not the low class citizens that most of the students on and off campus view us as or the necessary evil that the University views us as. To the commenter posting rude comments about the author just remember this. If it wasn’t for people like myself and the all the employees of FMS, including the man mentioned in the article, people like the poster wouldn’t have a beautiful campus with well maintained buildings, dorms and apartments to live in and you wouldn’t have a school to go to. If you live on or off campus and enjoy your hot water when you shower just remember that we make sure you have that water. My job specifically is to make sure you have that hot water and heat during the winter, and I take pride in my job. We are well paid well educated trades people in our specific trades. We are people just like the poster with families to feed and bills to pay.
Maybe if people like the poster would say hi when you see people in the red and blue shirts and not view us as second class citizens you would have a different view of these people and what they do to make sure this University functions on a daily basis
You appear to have missed the point. But sure. Statistically speaking, USC graduates do make a lot of money and fill upper-class jobs, not that that is a guarantee by any means. It doesn’t matter if we have a high job or a low job, the honor should still be there. Your rudeness toward the author shows you’re no better than the rich and powerful guy that neglects the lower-class.
Ah, it’s so nice to see you rich, powerful upper-class types giving honor to the plebeians who, because of lesser ability and inferior birth, are incapable of achieving success on the same level as you. Oh wait, what’s that you say? You’re just a college sophomore who doesn’t even have a resume or a job? You mean you’re just *assuming* that because of your high birth and superior ability, you’re guaranteed a powerful upper-class job? Don’t count your chickens before they’re hatched!

Recruitment of 13-year-old athlete is out of bounds
As a longtime college counselor, former admissions officer and high school teacher, I was appalled to read that USC’s football coach has made a scholarship commitment to a 13-year-old, and that he has done the same thing before at another institution. It violates every principle of sound recruiting set out by the NCAA and the National Association for College Admission Counseling, not to mention it puts unconscionable pressure not only on the young man in question but also on every other potential athlete who now will have to start bulking up in third grade to get that big commitment from USC by the time he’s 13.
I am struggling to understand how USC — or any other reputable institution — can permit this invasion at a particularly delicate time in a young person’s development; especially by someone clearly unconcerned with his long-term growth except as it might benefit the team. I’ve been told that “other schools have done it,” but that’s an excuse from a 13-year-old, not a justification from an institution that should know better.
And what is this boy supposed to do now? He says USC has been his “dream” school, but what does that mean at 13? And how will his behavior change as a result of this commitment and attention? What happens if he breaks a leg or tears a ligament? It’s a long way to senior year. And USC can always change its mind at the last minute, as it did with 14-year-old basketball recruit Ryan Boatright not long ago. Again, what justifies recruiting 13 year olds in the first place? If it had been done over the Internet, we might be worried about a lot more than just a basketball or football scholarship.
As someone who has spent my professional life working in the best interests of my students (often including running interference for them with overbearing parents who want them to become little Einsteins before their time), I find this behavior unacceptable and call on USC and other institutions who recruit in this way to repudiate it. Let kids be kids and, when they’re ready, by all means recruit them, but responsibly.
As Jonathan Kozol has written, “Childhood is not merely basic training for utilitarian adulthood. It should have some claims upon our mercy, not for its future value to the economic interests of competitive societies but for its present value as a perishable piece of life itself.”
This behavior is shameful and should embarrass the university.

What can a degree from USC do for you?
In Somto Ugwueze’s article (“Freshmen increasingly concerned about cost of tuition, survey shows” Feb. 1, 2010) the emphasis on the rise of tuition and the ability to finance an education from USC is on many students’ list of concerns. However, even with the concerns, would attaining an education from USC help recent graduates recover those tuition costs quickly?
As tuition continues to rise, many students may start to wonder if pursuing a higher education, let alone choosing USC, was the right choice. With the recent downturn in the economy and the job offers to recent graduates dwindling, many students are concerned if finding a job after graduation is still plausible. And if they do find a job, what kind of financial security can they expect? According to a survey done by PayScale of the Best Schools in California by Salary Potential, the salary chart shows USC as one of the top seven schools with a higher starting median salary in California.
Besides a better starting salary, USC also provides its students with an advantage in getting that first job over any other institution. With well over 220,000 living USC alumni — the vast majority of them living in California — the networking and relationships of the Trojan family is any job-seeking USC graduate’s most prized possession.
It would make sense for many students to worry now, but, in the long run, USC offers students vast avenues and opportunities to land that first job. With a higher median salary than most, graduates can expect the process of paying off school loans to be expedited.

The second day of the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge found the No. 9 USC women’s golf team clinging to a two stroke lead entering the final day. The Women of Troy began Tuesday’s round with an eight stroke lead over No. 7 Duke, but finished it just two ahead of No. 13 Pepperdine.
The Women of Troy turned in the second-best team effort of the day, only to see Pepperdine’s charge reduce their lead dramatically. The teams battled windy, rainy conditions all morning and into the afternoon.

“We got rained on pretty hard, so everyone kind of struggled,” said sophomore Jennifer Song. An hour-and-a-half-long delay disrupted play in the afternoon, as staff swept water off the greens.
“We started at 8:30 [a.m.], and we only had one hole left,” Song said of the break. “We didn’t get back out ’til 3 [p.m.], so it was a really long day.”
Song leads the team at even-par 142 (67-75). Her second-round 75 is her highest score of the season, having previously kept all her scores under 71. Song was leading after day one and is now tied for third, four strokes behind Pepperdine’s Lisa McCloskey. Song began the second day with nine straight pars, but three bogeys and a double bogey on the back nine knocked her from the top of the leaderboard.
“My shots were terrible today,” Song said. “Even when I had good chips, I couldn’t finish them because my putting was so bad.”
Junior Lizette Salas moved from eighth place to tie for seventh after a 2-over-par 73 put her at 3-over-par 145 (72-73) for the tournament. Salas, who tied senior Caroline Kim for the lowest score on the team, was consistent throughout the round, with 14 pars, three bogeys and a birdie.
Senior Belen Mozo dropped into a tie for 15th at 6-over-par 148 (69-79). Mozo struggled in the rainy conditions and never found her footing a day after her lowest round of the season.
Kim turned in a 2-over-par 73 that included five bogeys and three birdies. She rose from a tie for 34th to a tie for 20th at 7-over-par 149 (76-73). Kim is in position for her lowest finish of the season, four spots below her tie for 30th at the Mason Rudolph Championship last September.
Sophomore Inah Park finished with six straight pars and sits in a tie for 37th at 11-over 153 (78-75).
Along with the team’s five scoring members, freshman Cyna Rodriguez and senior Stefanie Endstrasser are playing as individuals. After both firing 11-over-par 82’s today, Rodriguez is tied for 52nd at 14-over-par 156 (74-82), and Endstrasser is tied for 65th at 17-over-par 159 (77-82).
The Women of Troy are poised to earn their first victory in the 15-year history of the challenge. Rain is not in the forecast for tomorrow, which should mean lower scores overall. Only six of 15 teams improved their score on the second, rain-filled day of play.
The final round begins at 8 a.m. Wednesday.

As members of the prestigious Trojan athletic program, USC’s finest student-athletes are rarely displayed in a light which depicts them as anything other than competitors inside the white lines.
Hidden talent · Junior outside hitter Tri Bourne will have his artwork featured inside the Galen Center’s Hall of Fame starting Feb. 11. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
But thanks in large part to the family of USC alumnus Louis Galen and the Roski School of Fine Arts, 18 USC athletes are again getting the opportunity to display their abilities on a much different type of canvas — the Louis Galen ARTLETICS Exhibition.
Whereas a swimming pool, tennis court or football field usually allows for these individuals to showcase their talents to large audiences, these individuals will now be performing on a stage, which celebrates their artistic passion and creativity in fields such as drawing, painting, ceramics, design and digital photography.
This collaborative project by the USC Athletic Department and the Roski school will be the fifth endeavor of its type on campus and will run from Feb. 11 to March 21 inside the Galen Center’s Hall of Fame.
The highly-accomplished list of athletes who will be presenting their works of art at this year’s annual exhibition spans over 11 different varsity sports: football, men’s and women’s basketball, volleyball, track and field, men’s water polo, men’s and women’s tennis, rowing, women’s golf, swimming and cross country.
This year’s group includes: Marlena Adamska (rowing), Victoria Alimonda (golf), Iskra Angelova (rowing), Tri Bourne (volleyball), Ashley Corral (basketball), Robert Erickson (football), Robert Farah (tennis), Brett Giery (water polo), Sophie Gosper (swimming), Dina Hegazy (swimming), Matt Kecki (tennis), Rebecca Lett (cross country), Vanni Mangoni (swimming), Katalin Mate (track and field), Dalilah Muhammad (track and field), Mitch Mustain (football), Valeria Pulido (tennis) and Scott Stephens (football).
Among the notable members of the list of athletes are Farah and Kecki, who were on last year’s NCAA national championship men’s tennis team and Mangoni, who went on to win the Pac-10 400-yard swimming individual medley in 2008.
Mustain served as the backup quarterback the past two seasons for the football team, Giery played on the back-to-back national championship men’s volleyball team in 2008 and 2009, Corral currently leads the Women of Troy’s basketball team in scoring and Bourne was an outside hitter on last year’s NCAA runner-up men’s volleyball team.
Erickson and Stephens have appeared in special teams action for the Trojans, and Mate and Muhammad are versatile track and field athletes. Mate, a transfer from Auburn, placed fourth in the discus at the 2008 NCAA championships. Muhammad finished third in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles in the 2009 NCAA championships.
This year’s crop of artists also includes two student-athletes who are no strangers to ARTLETICS — Hegazy and Mangoni. Both Hegazy and Mangoni have now been part of the last three Galen art exhibitions.
While Hagazy’s accomplishments are well-documented in the pool; her artistic résumé illustrates how, despite a rigorous schedule, she is not afraid to swim the extra lap. Last year, her work was selected for an exhibit featuring art by NCAA student-athletes shown at the NCAA Convention in Washington D.C. and at the NCAA Hall of Champions in Indianapolis.
An open reception to honor the ARTLETIC recipients will be held at the Galen Center at noon Feb. 24 and will be free and open to the public.
The exhibition will be available for viewing during all athletic events held at the Galen Center, or by appointment.

When The Color Purple opens tonight at the Pantages Theatre, much of the talk will center on American Idol season three winner Fantasia Barrino’s return to the show. The funny thing is she will be starring alongside the woman whose shocking elimination from that same season’s competition arguably paved the way for Fantasia’s victory, fourth runner-up La Toya London, whose coronation as America’s favorite singer was for many a foregone conclusion. The two now have to play sisters.
But if you were expecting any backstage rivalry — sibling or otherwise — think again.
Broadway · American Idol veteran La Toya London plays Nettie, one of the stars of The Color Purple musical. - Photo courtesy of Broadway L.A. 
“People see it, and they’re like, ‘You guys come off really good as sisters,’” London said. “And it’s because, offstage, we are — we truly are.”
London plays Nettie, who as a child was forced by cruel circumstances to leave her beloved older sister Celie (Barrino) behind, but not before promising to write. “Nothing but death can keep me from it,” she says in Alice Walker’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, on which the musical is based.
Nettie never writes — or so it seems — and Celie takes her for dead.
That isn’t the whole story, but the uninitiated would be better served by finding the rest out for themselves. Suffice it to say that The Color Purple is a simple but profound story of self-discovery with a back drop of racial issues, which unfold with a certain haphazard grace.
If it doesn’t sound like musical material, that’s because it isn’t. The announcement that Walker’s book would be musicalized for the Broadway stage was as unexpected to London as to the next person.
“I was very surprised that they made it into a musical, because it’s such a heavy piece of literature,” London said. “As a play, yes, but you wonder, ‘How are they going to add music to this and not water it down?’ And they succeeded.”
The show, since it opened in 2006, has been showered with praise, including a Tony for the woman who originated the role of Celie, LaChanze.
For someone like London, who grew up with only a vague notion of what Broadway was — “I’d only heard the term,” she said, adding that she never had any theatrical aspirations — being cast in such a large production was a big deal.
“I was really, really happy,” London said. “I felt like it was meant to be, especially when I went into my New York audition.”
At her callback, London showed up in full Nettie garb. She wanted to say, “Hands down, I’m her.” She did.
London has been performing in the touring production of The Color Purple ever since.
As a singer first and an actress second, the show’s music — a bluesy, churchy, pop-gospel soundtrack — particularly resonated with her.
“The songs that they do have in there are perfect, and they go with the time period,” London said. “They express the emotion that’s happening at that time on stage. It’s just beautiful, beautiful music, well put together.”
Although London had seen Steven Spielberg’s film adaptation of The Color Purple enough times to have memorized every line, she had only touched on Walker’s book by this point. During rehearsals, she revisited the book, which put the play into perspective.
“I got a better understanding of the story, because the movie only can express so much within the time frame,” she said. “The book definitely spells it all out for you.”
She emphasized the ending in particular, which Spielberg changed slightly but the musical retains. It involves a certain reconciliation between two major characters, which has emotional as well as thematic significance.
London will be finished with The Color Purple at the end of February, after which she plans to return to her music.
In the meantime, she hopes to touch as many lives as she can before the run ends. Asked what people should take away from the show, she quickly replied, “Inspiration.”
“That if a person is insecure or afraid to go after life or go after their dreams, if a person is abused or [is] the abuser, hopefully it just brings change into people’s lives or creates some type of sense of wanting to change and to want better for yourself — whether you change your situation, your surroundings or your attitude,” London said. “This is a story about love and forgiveness, and loving yourself and finding the beauty within yourself.”

Tony Ciarelli loves his coach.
He hangs out with him on the weekends. He eats dinner and sleeps at his house. He even obeys his coach’s orders to take out the trash.
Not too many players have this intimate of a relationship with their coach. Then again, not too many players have their father as their college coach.
USC standout sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli has been coached by his father, Rocky Ciarelli, for most of his life. Throughout Tony’s high school club and now collegiate career, Rocky has been on the sideline, usually pushing his son harder than his teammates.
“I’m not sure I’d be the same player without him as a coach,” Tony said. “I expect my dad to be harder on me than everybody else. That’s how his dad was to him, and that’s how I want him to be with me.”
There was little doubt about what sport Tony would end up playing as he grew up. While he played everything from football to basketball to baseball (the only sport he didn’t play was soccer, as he said his parents didn’t want to sit out in the cold and watch him play) none of those sports resonated in the Ciarelli family as much as volleyball.
Much like football has the Mannings and baseball has the Boones, volleyball has the Ciarellis.
Tony’s cousin, Allison Ciarelli, was an All-State volleyball player at Golden West College. His mom, Cammy Ciarelli, played four years at UCLA and won 14 pro beach tournaments in the early ’90s ­— most of them with three-time Olympian Holly McPeak. Rocky played at Long Beach State for three years and then in several professional indoor events before coaching for 24 years at Huntington Beach High School and, for the past two years, at USC as a volunteer assistant coach.
Considering that Tony is the youngest out of all his cousins, he was immersed in volleyball almost from birth. As a toddler, he could be found at the beach playing “pepper,” a game involving digging and setting the ball, with his dad. Cammy was still on the professional tour when Tony was young, so while she was playing, Rocky and Tony would be on another part of the beach, chiseling another name into the lineage of Ciarelli volleyball players.
“He did that everyday from the time he was 3 to 7,” Rocky said. “That was his entertainment. We’d go in the water and come out and he’d want to play pepper. That was his thing.”
As he got older, Tony would hang around his father’s friends while they played, often playing the role of setter, and at the middle school camps Rocky ran. As a third-grader, he lined up across from kids twice his age.

“I want to be the best at everything I do, and the only way to do that is by playing people better than you,” Tony said.
This trend continued at Huntington Beach High School, where Tony made the varsity team as a sophomore. Both Rocky and Tony said that was the most difficult time in their father/coach relationship. As the youngest player on the squad, Rocky was pretty hard on young Tony.
Tony said Rocky only kicked him out of practice once during his high school career, but there were times when Tony and Rocky would come home from practice and Tony wouldn’t talk to Rocky until the next day.
“A couple of times I probably went a bit over the top,” Rocky said. “But the next day we would usually talk about it and figure it out. It was tough for him because, when he would come home and want to vent about the coach being an idiot, he would have to tell his mom. That’s kinda how it worked.”
The Ciarellis have done a good job separating volleyball and family life, but this isn’t easy considering that, at the Ciarelli home, volleyball is family.
Just take a stroll down to Huntington Beach on a Sunday afternoon, and you can usually find the extended family gathered together for dinner and volleyball.
But this isn’t a fun, festive game. This is a my-team-is-going-to-beat-your-team-30-to-zero, cutthroat, no-mercy game.
“You will never meet a more competitive family than mine,” Tony said. “Everyone gets mad when they lose, especially me. I’m not allowed to jump because I’m the only one still playing volleyball, but I still only get beaten every once in a while. It’s not fun and games. At the Ciarellis’ beach volleyball games, everybody wants to win.”
This competitive spirit has bonded Tony and Rocky on and off the court.
“We have arguments, but we both have handled it well because, whether it’s at home or on the court, both of us know we want to win more than anything,” Tony said.
The Ciarellis have won — a lot. Rocky was the coach of Tony’s U-18 club team that won four major tournaments, including a gold medal at the Junior Olympics. He calls coaching his son, “the greatest thing in the world.”
Now, there’s another championship that the father/son duo have set sights on. With Rocky on the sidelines and Tony providing the kills, the Ciarellis hope they can celebrate an NCAA national championship on the court in California this year, together.
And Tony wouldn’t have it any other way.
“I love my dad. I’d miss him if he wasn’t here.”

this article doesn’t tell the full story about this kid..
He acts like a complete moron during games.  He jaws with the opposing fanbases at every single game.. he has no class but his head coach, who is an even bigger moron, approves of his behavior..
It’s called competition you moron!  You must be one of those AYSO idiots who believes that everyone should be nicey nice and everyone should get a metal.  Look at Ferguson’s stats in the last 2 of his 3 years here at USC.  It’s a no brainer.  You obviously haven’t got one.  Tony’s a great player with a ton of heart, something you don’t see in college volleyball that often anymore.  Just ask the legends like Tim Hovland and Steve Obradavich,  Those guys had hearts like Tony!!

Theater is definitely not entertainment for the everyday person that enjoys a good story. It’s more for an audience that appreciates the art of acting and enjoys a live performance, in addition to a good story. Unlike most untrained screen actors, theater actors have a deep love for the stage where they are able to develop an emotional connection with the audience as the story progresses.
Curtain call · Applying skills learned over the past two and a half years, final-year MFA Acting  students McKinley Belcher III (above) and Thomas Chavira II (below) perform in Orestes 2.0. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Orestes 2.0, one of three plays organized by the USC School of Theatre’s Master in Fine Arts Acting Program for the spring semester, showcases live acting passionately.
The 11-member MFA cast did an excellent job portraying the various characters, bringing enthusiasm and joy to their performances.
McKinley Belcher III (Orestes) projected his voice very well and moved about the stage confidently, while Julia Davis (Electra) sets the story’s conflict in the second scene with a relaxed and confident presence. All 11 of these charismatic MFA actors really brought their respective characters to life.
From the opening scene, audience members immediately got the sense that this was going to be a different play. Nicole Maroon, playing a forensics expert, pointed a red laser at an audience member’s torso while describing the circumstances of a murder. This sort of actor to audience interaction added a unique touch that isn’t often found in other plays. It shows that these actors are truly in character, using someone from the audience as a prop.
Charles Mee’s Orestes 2.0 follows a soldier, Orestes, who recently returned from the war in Troy.  It layers political commentaries atop the tale of Orestes’ murder of his mother six days earlier at the encouragement of his sister, Electra. Both are about to be put on trial, yet Electra wants to save Orestes by helping him come to grips with what he did.  In a scene with his grandfather, Menelaus (Henry Martone), Orestes tried to justify the murder, yet had difficulty doing so.
“It was clear with Orestes that Charles Mee was thinking about the first Iraq War, Desert Storm,” said Andrew J. Robinson, director of the MFA Acting Program. “The reason he calls this play 2.0 is because, when we invaded Iraq [in ’03], that’s when he revised Orestes into the second version of it.”
If you don’t have past experience watching live theater productions, Orestes 2.0 may be a very difficult story to follow. Most storytelling viewers are accustomed to watching films with (usually) one active protagonist who struggles to achieve someone, something or both. In other words, the protagonist overcomes obstacles to reach his goal. It’s that struggle audience members connect with. Plays, especially one like Orestes 2.0, are a different form of expression.
It’s a non-traditional play that doesn’t have a clear three-act structure. In fact, one might even call it experimental. While it does have some semblance of a beginning, middle and end, it’s so intertwined with political commentaries and soliloquies on human nature that it requires very careful listening to follow. The MFA Program’s adaptation of Mee’s play has moments of didacticism, however, and such political commentaries take away from the story. It is worth mentioning, though, that MFA actor Anthony Bryce Graham did a worthy President Obama impersonation that received laughs from the Scene Dock Theatre audience.
Nonetheless, the acting was impressive and the sound design memorable. In one of two standout scenes, it appeared that the cast members were interacting under the blue hued moonlit shadow of trees. In another drama-filled scene, the intense sounds of helicopters filled the Scene Dock Theatre with its lights circling about, as Orestes prepared to throw a child off the building.
While Orestes 2.0 is a challenging story to follow, the USC community should consider viewing this play and supporting our USC MFA Theatre actors who have a passion for the art form. Orestes 2.0 debuted Saturday, Feb. 6 and is next scheduled for Friday, Feb. 19 at 7 p.m. and Saturday, Feb. 20 at 8 p.m. with four more shows scheduled.

One of literature’s most famous visions of life after death is given a suitably bloody makeover with Dante’s Inferno, a hack-and-slash adventure video game that dropped this week for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Hellish · New Electronic Arts game Dante’s Inferno follows a former crusader’s journey through hell after his beloved Beatrice is kidnapped. - Photos courtesy of Visceral Games 
Based loosely on the epic poem by Italian poet Dante Alighieri, Dante’s Inferno follows a former crusader’s brutal journey through the nine circles of hell after his beloved Beatrice is kidnapped by Lucifer. The design of the game’s underworld was heavily inspired by the poet’s famous vision of a hell divided into layers ordered by the cardinal sins.
“We were really interested in making a game set in hell, and not just any version of hell, but specifically the medieval Christian vision of the afterlife,” said Jonathan Knight, the game’s executive producer and creative director.
That focus led the development team at Visceral Games — the Electronic Arts studio behind the survival horror game Dead Space — to Dante’s legendary “Inferno.” Thankfully for the crew designing the game, both Dante’s detailed descriptions in the inferno itself and the widespread influence that his satirical masterpiece has on Western art and literature translated easily into game’s design.
“In researching the topic, we quickly realized that Dante Alighieri’s imaginative and comprehensive depiction of hell in nine circles was more than enough material for a video game adaptation,” Knight explained. “In seeing the many, many maps of hell that have been drawn over the centuries based upon reading his poem, it just became clear that an amazing road map was at our fingers.”
For example, the level modeled after lust the second circle of hell, finds the bone-scythe wielding Dante struggling against the poet’s notorious hurricane of lustful souls. He eventually climbs a decidedly phallic tower and faces off against a humongous version of the circle’s most notorious resident, Queen Cleopatra.
In contrast to the video game’s main character, the original poem’s protagonist was a meek poet following the deceased Beatrice from inferno to paradise. Some of Dante’s famous satirical portraits of his political and religious contemporaries writhing about underground are left intact in the game, but overall, the reimagining takes on a far darker and more violent tone.
The game clearly distinguishes itself from the satire and melodrama of the original work, and Knight promises the new narrative direction the game takes will be just as compelling as the underlying story about a desperate man chasing his beloved through the bowels of the afterlife.
“In addition to being an adaptation of one of the great works of Western literature, there is a very powerful and universal story that the team has crafted — which sits on top of the poem — that really keeps you playing,” Knight said.
One major point of criticism that the game has faced — especially after the release of the demo a few months ago — is that the gameplay too closely resembles that of powerhouse Sony franchise God of War, another series based on a blood-stained antihero tearing through ancient mythology. Knight suggested that it is his game’s play with the notions of sin and redemption that truly sets it apart from the more amoral Kratos, the protagonist of the Greek myth-inspired God of War.
“The combat focuses on the duality of the hero — as both a holy and unholy warrior — and allows the player to either absolve or punish the damned and the many minions of Hell,” Knight explained. “This duality permeates the upgrade trees, the magic system, the collectible relics and the result is a much more open-ended and tunable set of abilities than the typical action game.”
The game arrives on the coattails of an expansive and instantly notorious marketing campaign that featured — among other things — checks for $200, publicly mailed to game critics in the name of  greed.
A lot of the buzz around Dante’s Inferno in recent weeks came from the re-release of the original poem with a new cover based on the game, a bonus section of screenshots and even a brand new foreword written by Knight.
“It was a tremendous thrill, and I put a lot of time into it,” Knight said concerning the daunting task of writing an introduction to one of the most famous works of Western literature. “While the video game is obviously a very loose adaptation of the poem, I am nonetheless a huge admirer of Dante’s genius and what he accomplished.”
Putting aside all the hype, the pre-release criticism and the wild and weird deviations from the original work, Knight believes that one positive effect of Dante’s Inferno the video game might be that it draws gamers to “Dante’s Inferno,” the poem.
“I wanted people to see how the game team strove to stay connected with the source material throughout the creative process,” Knight said. “And I truly believe that more people will come into contact with The Divine Comedy as a result of the game project.”

Valentine’s Day is as good of an excuse as any to dive into the candy jar. If you’re about to hop on the blood sugar rollercoaster, roll past those saccharine Peeps and Sweethearts and go for the good stuff — chocolate.
From sweet and creamy to rich and silky, chocolate has as many textures and nuances as wine or cheese. And like both of these foods, it has a surprising amount of health benefits when eaten in moderation.
Chocolate is rich in flavonoids — compounds found in plant-based foods that have antioxidant properties. Think of flavonoids as the defenders against your neighbor’s secondhand smoke or your prescription-power acne cream. In addition, the properties of chocolate are said to encourage lower blood pressure, better cholesterol and increased endorphins and serotonin.
While chocolate is high in fat, it’s mostly either monounsaturated or harmless saturated fat, but don’t look for salvation in a Snickers bar. Milk chocolate undergoes so much processing that most of the antioxidants are lost. To get the most bang for your heart-healthy buck, go for chocolate that’s 65 percent cocoa or higher.
When you go beyond Hershey and Nestlé, the world of chocolate becomes much more interesting. There are countless varieties of chocolate: dark, milk, flavored, filled, raw and air-trade — and they can spark as many “who’s better” debates as a cheese tasting can.
Not all chocolates are created equal. While personal taste is always a big factor, some brands just rock more than others. But if you want to make a good impression on Valentine’s Day, look closely.
For plain chocolate that is delicious but reasonably accessible, Divine, Scharffen Berger and Dagoba are all good options. Divine is creamy and smooth; Scharffen Berger is tantalizingly complex; and Dagoba is a snap to the taste buds.
Yet maybe for Valentine’s Day you want your chocolate to be extra special. If so, check out Intentional Chocolate. Not only is it made from sweet and tangy Hawaiian chocolate, Intentional Chocolate is meditated over and infused with good thoughts. Hokey, perhaps, but it can’t hurt.
Neither can fair-trade chocolate, which focuses on humane working conditions and fair wages for the cocoa farmers. By good fortune, most fair-trade chocolate tastes much better than your Walgreens’ checkout variety. A few especially tasty fair-trade brands are Green & Black, Rapunzel and Equal Exchange.
While straight-up chocolate is great, perhaps you crave an added surprise. Many brands of chocolate are flavored with herbs and spices, and others are filled with neat little add-ins — Dagoba makes a rainbow of flavors from Lavender Blueberry to Lemon Ginger. Another fair-trade brand, Endangered Species, packs its bars with everything from almonds and cranberries to pecans and maca root.
For those of you who are truly adventurous — or want to impress a wild sweetheart — take a plunge and try Vosges Haut-Chocolate’s bacon-infused chocolate. Besides having a very creamy chocolate base, the bacon gives it a sumptuous mix of sweet and salty, much like salted caramel. And for those wanting the perfect Valentine’s Day gift, Vosges also crafts many artisan and non-bacon-laced truffle collections that make Godiva look beggarly.
And don’t forget a few chocolate alternatives. Cacao nibs and cacao powder are essentially raw chocolate — think of them as crunchy little dark chocolate bombs. Since they do not contain dairy or sugar, they are diabetic and lactose intolerant-friendly and come packed with magnesium, iron and chromium. Some companies add them to regular chocolate to give it a sharp-tasting crunch. SweetRiot, a New York-based company, specializes in cacao-chocolate treats. Their most popular item is chocolate-dipped cacao nibs, which are like the delicious, evolved version of chocolate chips.
There is also carob, which comes from a Mediterranean evergreen shrub. Carob chips and carob powder resemble a malty, spiced version of chocolate. While you would not mistake carob for real chocolate, it’s tasty in its own right, and it is a great alternative for those with chocolate allergies.
But don’t stop your chocolatey adventures with bars and bricks. What makes chocolate so awesome — in addition to the great taste and health benefits — is that it’s so versatile. Melt some chocolate, break out the strawberries and you have a sexy little fondue pot just waiting for the new Glee episode. Hot chocolate — made from real sipping chocolate, not that sissy Swiss Miss stuff — can be like drinking liquid heaven, especially if it’s topped with toasted marshmallows or mixed with peppermint schnapps. Cacao butter can even be used as a great massage oil.
So go cocoa crazy — you’ll get an endorphin rush, and the heart-health benefits taste way better than Cheerios. Just remember that, like all the best things, moderation is key. The best part about gourmet chocolate is that it is so rich you won’t want to devour the whole bar — not by yourself at least.

Okay, this isn’t about chocolate. But comments are closed on your nut butter article… which I stumbled upon when looking for reviews of hemp seed butter. 
Just had to mention that I also once thought Smucker’s natural peanut butter was the best — until I found Algood’s! Might be a regional brand here in the Midwest. The label says “Algood Old Fashioned Peanut Butter”, 18 oz plastic jar, so much oil separates (just peanuts and salt) that I pour off half and save in the refrigerator to use in cooking as excellent peanut oil before stirring the rest in. It’s not only tastier even than Smuckers – it’s a lot cheaper! So if you only-peanuts peanut butter lovers ever get a chance to try it, go for it. The Algood company is based in Kentucky and they even say that they themselves (gasp!) make it.
Oh, yes, you can always mix peanut butter with cocoa powder or bits of chocolate candy, or spread it thickly over any chocolate bar. That makes this on topic, yes?
I love Vosges chocolate!  The first one I tried was the curry powder, which was admittedly not the best, but the chocolate itself is great quality, and their flavors are totally original.  Chili?  Yes, please!  Ginger?  My absolute favorite.

Ever feel like nobody appreciates your favorite movie from 2004?  Well, no need to fell prematurely dismayed: it’s very likely that it will be remade…bigger, faster, CGI-er.
Oops — I said the dirty word.  Films are no longer being “remade,” since that word suggests a lack of creativity, but rather films based off old franchises are being called “reboots.”  Don’t see the difference?
There isn’t one.  I’ve heard rebooting defined as forgetting continuity and taking a familiar story in a new direction. Hmmm.  Sounds like a remake!  Glad that’s settled.
It’s safe to pin much of the current “reboot craze” on Christopher Nolan’s excellent 2005 film Batman Begins. Ooh, it’s darker. Ooh, it’s more realistic. Ooh, no continuity with the nipple-suits! But it does feature the same Bat-characters in the same Bat-City with basically the same Bat-story.  Hey, that’s easy!  Let’s do it again!
Cue a more realistic 2006 Casino Royale, back-to-basics 2006 Superman Returns and from-the-top 2009 Star Trek. Cool.  But if you give a mouse a cookie…
In comes the excessive 2009 special effects fest Terminator: Salvation, a new Rocky Balboa movie with its edgy one-word title, Rocky, and a reported upcoming reboot of the middling action flick Mr. & Mrs. Smith. (Why yes, astute reader.  That movie is only four years old.)  Uh-oh.  What have we done?
Not only are we giving Hollywood a new lease on every stale 80s franchise, now we’re giving them second chances at dribble they mishandled the first time around.  This is the definition of a can of worms that we should have buried within the center of the earth.  Instead, we might have to watch The Core again.  Hey, Watchmen sucked, let’s reboot it!
This cat is out of the bag.  The best thing we can do for the safety of our tender film tastes is to grab on tight to the films that were done right the first time and pray Michael Bay doesn’t get his dirty hands on them. The Birds? You’re kidding! Planet of the Apes? Again?!
We’re too late.  Original filmmaking as we know it has died.  Damn you rebooters!  Damn you all to Hell!
It seems that 3D movies may be the only safeguard against filmic banality.  Yes, what a strange and wondrous new concept, Mr. Cameron.  We should do Jaws like that!  Oh wait…

For the first time since arriving in Los Angeles, head coach Lane Kiffin will have the opportunity to speak without biting his tongue for the press and talk about what he knows best — football.
At the seventh annual USC Football/Nike Coach of the Year Southern California Coaches Clinic on April 9 and 10, Kiffin, along with assistant coaches Ed Orgeron, Monte Kiffin, Joe Bery, Willie Mack Garza and James Cregg, will host a two day clinic offering expertise to Southern California football coaches of every level.
This will be the first USC Football/Nike Clinic hosted without Pete Carroll.
The $165 weekend includes speeches from almost the entire USC coaching staff, Oregon head coach Chip Kelly, Harvard’s Tim Murphy, prominent high school coaches, position specific film sessions, and, of course, a “coaches social hour” to conclude the first day.  Guests will also be invited to attend a USC spring football practice at Howard Jones Field.
The clinic, one of 20 held by Nike throughout the country, has sold out for the past six years.  Coaches, as well as those interested in learning about Kiffin and the new staff, are encouraged to reserve seats early.
Last year Nike reports said nearly 13,000 high school coaches attended 19 national clinics held by 71 Division 1A head coaches.  This year, the Galen Center Pavilion is expected to sell out to local youth, high school, and college level coaches for the seventh consecutive year.

Every Super Bowl Sunday the world becomes overloaded with testosterone. The concluding game of the NFL football season projects so many manly grunts, first-pumps and “yeaaaaaahs!” into the planet’s energy sphere that the universe created its own checks-and-balances to offset the excess masculinity.
Animal Planet’s Puppy Bowl is a counter-programming effort that is adorable enough to outlast decades of Budweiser commercials. It pits puppies four months old and younger against each other in a model stadium full of chew toys and camera-rigged water bowls. And as a telecast for those who stared at the kenneled dogs in the mall pet shop, former NFL commentators try to make sense of the fluffy mess as a soundtrack of cheering fans loops over pulsating beats.
But while Sunday’s only other novelty football offering, the Lingerie Bowl,  uses the objectification of women as sexual objects for testosterone transference, the Puppy Bowl is animal objectification at its least-sexual cutest.
But the Puppy Bowl is not only a football-friendly alternative for animal lovers. It is also a commentary on the primitive nature of the games we worship. With the idea of televised football games stripped down to its bare aesthetic essentials — white-line-painted green grass in a stadium — and humans replaced by oafish puppies, the event highlights the basic animalistic tendencies that drive the entertainment value of most sports.
Just like professional football players, Puppy Bowl contenders fight for control of rubber balls, run to the other side of the field in attempts to keep possession and fumble over each other as they try to assert dominance. And just like the real Super Bowl, Animal Planet’s televised event features corporate sponsors (Bissell, Pedigree, etc.), humorous commercials (for dog food) and an epic halftime show where puppies and toys are replaced with kittens and a scratching post.
Now if only Most Valuable Puppy Jake the Chug (chihuahua pug) would go head-to-head with Super Bowl MVP Drew Brees, the universe might finally attain hormonal homeostasis.

After ordering last week that officials begin cutting jobs and planning layoffs, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told an audience of city workers today that the cuts were unavoidable.
In the face of a worsening budget crisis, Villaraigosa sent a letter to City Council department heads last week requesting an effort to shift employees to open positions not paid for by the city’s general fund and to impose layoffs where necessary, the Los Angeles Times reported last week.
Tuesday, Villaraigosa told officials to ask quickly. Speaking in front of a crowd of mostly city workers, Villaraigosa called the layoffs unavoidable, the LA Times reported.
The layoffs are an attempt to deal with a $212 million shortfall.  Though Villaraigosa has indeed suggested layoffs in previous years to deal with the city’s financial problems, they have been averted until recently.  The city’s top budget official warned that the financial situation was creating a fiscal emergency and furthermore putting the city’s credit rating at risk.
“I don’t do this because I want to.  I do this because I must”, Villaraigosa told the LA Times.

Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel blasted liberal Democrat special-interest groups as “f—ing retarded” during a meeting with Democrats in August. While Emanuel’s reputation for being brash and profane has, until this point, been harmless or mildly offensive at worst, with this statement he clearly crossed the line of political correctness.
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
With his background as a core member of the Clinton administration, namely as the president’s senior advisor from 1993 to 1998, and, most recently with his service in the House of Representatives, representing the fifth district of Illinois, Emanuel cannot hide from the barrage of media attacks under the camouflage of inexperience. No matter how tempting, he cannot conveniently suggest the meeting was private, and his comments should therefore be disregarded, since the meeting was called to discuss politics, regardless of the fact that no Republicans were present.
Even if he were to make such a suggestion, he has no ground upon which to stand. By their nature, a number of occupations remain permanently in the public eye; politicians hold positions of leadership in society and so fall into this category. Like students keeping their watchful eyes on teachers, the public keeps a perpetually vigilant watch on politicians, waiting for them to misstep so the vulturous onlookers can swoop in and pick apart their carrion.
Appropriately, Emanuel has issued apologies in many directions, the most substantial of which was to Timothy Shriver, chairman and chief executive of the Special Olympics. “Rahm called Tim Shriver Wednesday to apologize and the apology was accepted … [The] White House remains committed to addressing the concerns and needs of Americans living with disabilities and recognizes that derogatory remarks demean us all,” the official press release stated. In all actuality though, the remark was offensive, it shouldn’t have received the press that it did, especially in light of “Rahmbo’s” predisposed tendency to mouth off insensitively.
Emanuel’s words compelled former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to use the platform of her Facebook page to implore President Obama to fire Emanuel for what she saw as the equivalent of a racial slur. Facebook, most frequently advertised as the nation’s largest political jab website, was obviously the most appropriate venue for such a derision. But, in the former governor’s defense, without a political platform to stand on, alternate routes must be used, and books can only say so much.
Palin did draw fire from the mercenaries of comedy, who were delighted to find the cache of ammunition she left lying on the side of the road. Saturday Night Live opened last Saturday with Andy Samberg as Rahm Emanuel issuing a passive and pseudo-sincere apology to the main camera and making provocative (more characteristic of Emanuel’s true style) sidebar comments to the camera to his right. His sidebar comment to Palin was amusing, “You come after me on Facebook? What?!? Are you 14?”
Steven Colbert also launched a few salvos at Palin after she was interviewed on Fox News and tried to distinguish Emanuel’s use of the “R word” from Rush Limbaugh’s use of the word as defensible since Limbaugh’s use was satirical (implying that all of his show would be satire).
As for the president’s decision, should he terminate Emanuel? After all, Obama hired him to leverage his political experience, contacts and no-nonsense style to help him achieve his agenda and objectives. A one-word insensitivity probably doesn’t rise to the level of being a terminable offense. Those looking to guillotine the chief of staff might do better to look for the axe labeled “ineffective at achieving his bosses objectives.”
So, while we are all cognizant of (and sensitive to the fact that) Mrs. Palin, being the mother of a child with Down Syndrome, might have a compelling protective instinct to call for more respectful behavior from our public officials, she would be better served to speak up on issues that truly necessitate political action and, in issues like this one, to demand reparations that are more suitable to the crime.
Reid Roman is a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering.
Reid Roman succinctly describes the situation Rahm finds himself in.  I refer to it as a fishbowl with everyone looking on.  Rahm’s comment was insensitive.  However, I do believe in accepting apologies as long as they are sincere.  I can think of a dozen other reasons that Rahm should resign, not the least of which is pursuing a health care policy that most citizens have deemed an overreach into their private lives.  Palin should graciously accept the apology and move on.  She will find herself needing to apologize for a statement or two along the way.
Palin is not without a platform. I think even young numbskulls like Reid knows what she stands for, so the cheap shots are unnecessary.
Also, it is does make me think the word “numbskull” is appropriate when applied to people who can’t tell the difference between someone SAYING something, and someone REPEATING it satirically to make fun of the person who said it in the first place. That’s not rocket science.
That being said, the whole thing is ridiculous and should not have generated this much controversy, unless you want to take RE to task for having such a foul mouth. This business of the use of a specific word offending people borders on insanity, and yes I include the “n-word” in that depiction; after all, it’s on every other rap album already. 
I hear that the American Psychiatric Association or some such organization wants to change the term from “mentally retarded” to “intellectually challenged” or some such thing. This is stupid (hope that word doesn’t offend anyone). Here’s why: “mentally retarded” means intellectually challenged. Why is one phrase offensive and the other not? How long before snotty little schoolkids start coming up with alternative slurs to “retard” — “disabe” or “intellitard” or who knows? Kids are creative. Then we can ban THAT phrase and come up with another one. 
The whole thing is… retarded.
Interesting article. The accompanying illustration sums up my thoughts perfectly!

On national signing day, the news that Seantrel Henderson was committing to play for USC skyrocketed the Trojans’ class ranking around the country.
Later that night, however, it became clear that Henderson would be putting off his decision until after he was completely aware of any sanctions that could surround the USC football program.
Now it looks like Henderson is back on the market.
In an interview with St. Paul’s ABC affiliate KSTP-TV’s Joe Schmidt, Henderson admitted that any sanctions that the NCAA could hand down would have a huge impact on his decision as to whether he will become a Trojan.
“Yeah, I think [sanctions] would [have an impact],” Henderson told Schmidt on Sunday night. “But at the same time, I would have to, you know, talk to the coaches to see exactly what’s going on… Because that’s the school I would like to go to, but then at the same time I just can’t walk into anything that’s going to, like, make my future, you know, not as good as it could be.”
When he was first being recruited, Henderson said he considered USC along with national powerhouses Miami (Fla.), Florida, Notre Dame, Ohio State and Minnesota among others. All of those schools are now likely back in the running for one of the nation’s most prized recruits.
A closed-door hearing is scheduled for later this month during which time the USC football program could receive sanctions from the NCAA stemming from the possible infractions surrounding former Trojan running back Reggie Bush.
Henderson is said to be waiting on the results of the hearings to make his decision final, but it is unlikely that the results will be official before the signing deadline of April 1.

A strong-armed robbery that occured in the middle of the day Sunday has been classified by detectives as being “unusual.”
The USC Department of Public Safety crime report described a man, who according to DPS Det. Josh Voyda is not a part of the USC community, walking down Jefferson Boulevard near Orchard Avenue when he was approached by a male suspect who demanded his money and started a fight when the victim did not give up his money.
The suspect was accompanied by two other suspects in a get-away car upon his departure from the scene.
The robbery occurred at 1 p.m., which DPS said was an oddity among similar crimes.
“This is not normal, for the location,” Voyda said. “The time of day is unusual for a street robbery to occur in the USC area.”
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said he does not know why this crime occurred when it did, but assures students that DPS is working on preventing these kinds of events in the future.
“It’s somewhat unusual. We have predicting policing strategy working on it but it’s hard to say why it happened,” Carlisle said.
The victim suffered minor injuries but did not want medical attention, Voyda said.
DPS and LAPD are following up the investigation with the information they obtained from multiple witnesses who gave good descriptions of the suspects and the get-away car, Voyda said.
