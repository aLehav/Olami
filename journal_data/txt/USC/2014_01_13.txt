Dubbed “USC’s most questionable name in news,” The Noble Savage began making waves with its witty satirical articles in mid-December.
Quoting fictional USC employees and students, such as “a [bookstore] employee with a passion for overpriced apparel” and “a student … in USC’s ‘Undercover Informant’ major,” The Savage spins popular issues on campus to create sarcastic stories.
Gus Kimball, a freshman majoring in business administration, originally wanted to write stories for Sack of Troy, another satirical publication aimed toward USC students.
“I was writing these little, comical stories and decided maybe I could actually do something with them,” Kimball said.
He sent one of his stories in an application to the Sack of Troy editorial board but, rather than giving him the position, the editors at Sack of Troy allegedly plagiarized parts of his application story under their own names.
In a string of messages, Axel Hellman, Editor-in-Chief of Sack of Troy, admitted to similariy in the stories and agreed to take his stories down. Sack of Troy called the matter a “coincidence” in a brief comment to the Daily Trojan and has since filed a complaint with Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards against The Noble Savage.
“I was obviously very put off … by their actions,” Kimball said. “Why not start my own, you know? And do it better.”
And so began The Noble Savage.
“For two weeks when I didn’t really feel like studying for finals, I wrote funny articles instead. Once I had enough, I bought a domain name, published them and became that annoying guy on Facebook … trying to get the word out,” Kimball said.
In its first two days, the site reached 50 followers and had nearly 1,000 views.
The next week, Kimball happened to be chatting with Frank Fink, a sophomore majoring in business administration and computer science, and mentioned The Savage. Fink immediately asked to help with the site. It then snowballed from short stories written in Kimball’s spare time to a full-fledged online publication with multiple writers.
“Once you start doing something it gets bigger and bigger and bigger … that was amazing to me, that this hobby became something that inspired other people,” Kimball said.
What began as a simple humorous idea jotted in the margin of his notebook became something that Kimball can call his own.  Though he never set out to gain followers or attention, or even to write full-length stories, Kimball is amazed at what simple passion can do.
“It’s really cool, you know, to be behind something like this,” Kimball said.
He began the website as a forum for his own ideas and was in awe at the positive response it received, which convinced him to continue broadening its scope.
The Savage has expanded to include comics and witty blurbs, alongside its feature satire stories, and Fink and Kimball hope to continue taking it to new levels.
“I want to continue to take it into a different, unexpected direction with exposé pieces and videos as well,” Kimball said.
Editor’s Note: In an official comment, a representative of the Sack of Troy asserted that there was no plagiarism of Gus Kimball’s work in any way, shape, or form. Gus Kimball told representatives of the Sack of Troy that he started the Noble Savage because he wanted his own organization, not because any perceived harm or dissatisfaction with the Sack of Troy. 
Well, where can one read The Noble Savage? Is it a newspaper? Website? Come on, Daily Trojan, tell us more.

The musicians behind The Front Bottoms are finally emerging from the dingy basements that fostered an indie punk sound punctuated with elements of folk-pop, and stepping into the national spotlight: from the bottom to front and center. Formed more than eight years ago in northern New Jersey, The Front Bottoms is composed of original members Brian Sella, performing vocals and lead guitar, and Matt Uychich on drums, who added Tom Warren on bass and Ciaran O’Donnel who plays keyboard, trumpet and guitar during live performances.

The spunky group has landed positions on seven different Billboard charts, including No. 3 on Top New Artists. NPR also heralded “Twin Size Mattress,” a single from the band’s 2013 album, The Talon of the Hawk, as one of the top 100 tracks of 2013.
Achieving this level of recognition has been a long and dedicated process for The Front Bottoms, who have been largely on the road for the past four years. Sella and the other members have lived wherever they could to save money, and leapt at every touring opportunity they could get. And the hard work is beginning to pay off.
“It’s incredible. We can see that there’s a process of reaction and now the fact that more people are getting to hear our music and experience the positive vibes is pretty cool,” Sella said.
Critics have called The Front Bottoms everything from folk punk to pop-punk to indie rock. They’ve been likened to Jonathan Richman and The Mountain Goats (admittedly one of Sella’s inspirations, and a comparison he likes hearing).
But under the genre category on the band’s Facebook page is simply the question, “What’s a genre?” Sella said it can be hard to pinpoint their style in exact terms.
“There’s too much music to be putting everything into a category,” Sella said.
Rock ‘n’ roll is a good term to describe the attitude of their music, he said, but in terms of sound, there are many different styles at work.
“I’d like to think of it as a little bit dance-y. It definitely has a pulse and you can jump up and down to the rhythm of the music,” Sella said. “I guess it’s maybe a little sloppy, punk rock. Dance-y but fun to listen to.”
Where Sella really departs from the rest of the rock ‘n’ roll crowd is his lyrical style. Clever and conversational, he leads listeners into anecdotes that can be tongue-in-cheek or stingingly sentimental, even sappily romantic.
Sella draws inspiration from just about anything: he makes up stories, listens to what he’s been told by others and borrows from situations his friends and family find themselves in. Though he warps disparate details into one new, cohesive song, the final stories always feel personal to him.
“It’s personal in the sense that I’m the one telling the story and I’m putting my own input into the story sort of selfishly,” Sella said.
He’s even picked up some details from homeless people he’s met while on the road and several have found their way into songs.
“We used to play a lot of basements in a lot of punk rock and folk rock scenes,” Sella said. “You meet a lot of interesting people and all of them are awesome and beautiful and a lot of the time I find stories from there.”
Incorporating humor into the balance alongside more emotional themes is an equally important part of Sella’s style.
“The bottom line is this isn’t the most serious thing in the world,” Sella said. “We should be able to laugh and have fun while we’re listening to this music.”
This approach is showcased in their song “Au Revoir (Adios)” in which Sella sings about saying au revoir to a girlfriend, whom he doesn’t think understands the meaning. She retorts with “Adios.”
“Little clever lines like that to make people smile are definitely just as much a part of the music and lyrics and songwriting as something that’s real intense and real emotion for me,” Sella said.
The Front Bottoms kicked off their 2014 Hot Chocolate tour in Michigan and will hit Southern California on Jan. 18 with a headlining performance at the Troubadour in West Hollywood.

The Pac-12 Conference released the USC Trojans’ 2014 football schedule last Wednesday. It will feature six home games, some familiar rivals and a coast-to-coast trip in mid-September.
The Trojans, who finished 19th in the AP poll with a 10-4 record in the 2013 season, will open the season at home on Aug. 30 against Fresno State — a foe the Trojans vanquished by a score of 45-20 in the Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl in December. This marks the first time the Trojans have opened the season against the same opponent they ended the last season with since 1917, when the Trojans — then playing at Bovard Field — defeated Arizona in front of a crowd of 2,000.
The team will waste no time getting into the Pac-12 mix as it travels the next week to Palo Alto, Calif. to take on Stanford in a much-anticipated rivalry matchup on Sept. 6. The Cardinal, who finished the 2013 season ranked No. 11 in the AP Poll, will look to avenge their surprising defeat at the Coliseum last season.
From there, the Trojans will catch a flight across the country to take on Boston College on Sept. 13.
After a bye week, the Trojans return to action for back-to-back home games against Oregon State (Sept. 17) and reigning Pac-12 South champion Arizona State (Oct. 4). Their October tour through the Pac-12 will continue the next week in Tucson against Arizona on Oct. 11, return home to play Colorado on Oct. 18 and end up in Salt Lake City to square off against Utah on Oct. 25.
The Trojans will look to shake off one of the roughest moments of the 2013 season when the Trojans travel to Pullman, Wash. on Nov. 1 to take on the Cougars of Washington State. Then, on Nov. 13, the Trojans will play in a Thursday night home game for the second season in a row when they host California, who struggled last season under first-year coach Sonny Dykes.
The season will end in traditional style as USC takes on two of its biggest rivals. The Trojans will head to Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, Calif. for their final conference matchup against quarterback Brett Hundley and the UCLA Bruins in the crosstown battle for the Victory Bell on Nov. 22. The Trojans will  then return to the Coliseum to attempt to reclaim the Jewelled Shillelagh as they wrap up their regular season against Notre Dame. Should the Trojans finish atop the Pac-12 South, they will play in the Pac-12 Championship Game on Friday, Dec. 5.
Notable omissions from the 2014 schedule are Oregon and Washington, Pac-12 rivals who rotate with their “State” counterparts on a two-year basis. Both schools will replace Oregon State and Washington State on the Trojans’ schedule in 2015. Absent from the team’s nonconferance slate are Hawai’i and Utah State.

The Women of Troy overcame a late rally on the road against Arizona on Sunday to prevail 54-45 over the Wildcats in another crucial Pac-12 conference game.
Standout · Junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama scored 16 points to lead the Women of Troy over the Arizona Wildcats on Sunday.aging 9.5 points per game. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Led by the strong play and the game-high 16 points of junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama, USC (11-6, 4-1 Pac-12) was able to bounce back with a win after Friday’s tough 94-86 overtime loss to No. 23 Arizona State.
“[Vaioletama] is so incredibly talented and her intensity, focus and effort on defense have allowed her to relax offensively and really step up her game on offense,” USC head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said.
The Women of Troy controlled the majority of the game, taking a 28-17 lead heading into halftime, before going on a 12-0 run in the second half to take a 19-point lead with a little more than 10 minutes remaining in the game.
That lead would begin to shrink after senior forward and captain Cassie Harberts picked up her fourth foul and was forced to sit out part of the second half due to foul trouble.
“We had a little letdown when Cassie got in foul trouble because she is such a great leader for us on the floor,” Cooper-Dyke said.
The Wildcats (4-11, 0-4) proceeded to go on a 7-0 run to trim the USC lead, while the Women of Troy’s foul count reached the double bonus. This allowed Arizona to get back into the game even after Harberts’ return, as they scored 11 straight points paired with a USC shooting slump to cut the lead to single digits.
With the Women of Troy clinging to a 50-45 lead and the momentum riding on the home team’s side with two minutes remaining, USC would finish strong.
They would execute defensively, holding the Wildcats to zero points in the final stages of the game, while freshman guard Courtney Jaco showed some maturity by hitting four late free throws to seal the game for the Women of Troy.
“I’m really proud of our team because we locked in and focused at the end of the game when we needed to,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We executed down the stretch and finished when we needed to.”
Jaco would also be responsible for the steal that put USC in the driver’s seat with just over 30 seconds to go.
The team shot the ball relatively well throughout, going 34 percent for the game, while they were a perfect 11 for 11 from the charity stripe. Arizona shot only 30 percent from the floor.
“We kept our composure when they began to come back and we stepped up our intensity and aggressiveness,” Vaioletama said.
The Women of Troy also used the deep ball to their advantage, going 5-for-16 from the three-point line, while Arizona was a dismal 1-for-9.
Rebounding was a large factor in USC’s success, as they used their size to out-board the Wildcats an outstanding 44-33.
Their hot shooting and strong defense is what gave USC an early lead in the first half, holding the Wildcats scoreless for nearly eight minutes and going on a 10-2 run to go up 20-11.
Vaioletama was the only USC player to enter double figures, while Jaco had nine and Harberts flirted with a double-double, scoring eight points and bringing down eight boards. Guard Candice Warthen was the only Arizona player to enter double digits with 12 points.
USC will return to the Galen Center this weekend to take on the Oregon schools. The Women of Troy will face Oregon State on Friday night before facing off against Oregon in a Sunday matinee.

Looking to earn its first Pac-12 win of the season and rebound from its first home loss of the year, the USC men’s basketball team hosted No. 1 Arizona at the Galen Center Sunday night. Though the Trojans fought hard throughout to keep the game from getting away from them, the Wildcats emerged with a 73-53 victory.
Junior guard Byron Wesley led the Trojans with 18 points on 7-of-14 shooting, six rebounds, two assists and two steals. Sophomore forward Strahinja Gavrilovic was the only other Trojan in double digits with 10 points, while freshman forward Nikola Jovanovic added eight points and four rebounds. Freshman guard Julian Jacobs finished with nine points, four steals and four assists.
“The feeling was great, playing hard against these guys,” Gavrilovic said about his increased role. “They probably have two or three players that will go to the NBA next year, so playing against them is a really good opportunity and a really good feeling.”
Arizona guard T.J. McConnell finished with 19 points, shooting 5-of-7 from behind the arc, with six assists and four rebounds. Forward Brandon Ashley also added 19 points on 7-of-10 shooting, four assists and two rebounds. Highly touted freshman forward Aaron Gordon added 12 points on 4-of-11 shooting and eight rebounds, while guard Nick Johnson had 15 points and five steals.
The stands were filled with fans from both sides to see if the Wildcats could get off to their best start in school history, or if the Trojans could shock the nation for their first conference win under head coach Andy Enfield. Lakers guard Nick Young and former NFL quarterback Matt Leinart were in attendance to cheer on the Trojans, while Lakers forward Jordan Hill and former Lakers forward Luke Walton were present to cheer on Arizona.
“I thought we were on our way,” Enfield said. “We had a great practice yesterday and I thought we played really hard today, so that’s a start. Our guards have to do a much better job of executing and making the right pass at the right time. Eighteen turnovers is too many.”
The Trojans gave their fans plenty to cheer about as they kept within striking range of the top team in the nation early and took a 21-18 lead with 8:27 left in the first half.
The Trojans expanded their lead to 27-23, but an 11-4 run to close out the half gave Arizona the 34-31 lead entering halftime. Both teams shot 13-of-30 from the field, and 40 percent from behind the arc. The Wildcats outrebounded the Trojans 18-15 and committed five turnovers to USC’s six.
The second half started where the first half ended, as the Wildcats went on an 8-0 run in the first 4:50. After building their lead to as many as 11, the Trojans began to fight back, cutting the deficit to as few as five points. A couple days after blowing a 13-point lead to UCLA and holding on to win, the Wildcats weren’t about to let the same thing happen twice in one weekend.
USC ran into problems with turnovers, committing 10 in the second half alone to give the Trojans a total of 18 for the game. Arizona finished the game on a 25-10 run to keep the Trojans at the bottom of the Pac-12.
“If we play defense like that in every game, we’ll be in every game in the Pac-12 for sure,” said senior guard Pe’Shon Howard, who finished with four points and five assists. “We just got to make plays at the end of the game and do better on offense and take care of the ball.”

On Monday, USC head coach Steve Sarkisian’s newly-completed coaching staff was dealt a curveball when defensive line coach Bo Davis, who accepted the position at USC on Jan. 7, informed Sarkisian that he would be leaving to take the same position at Alabama. This news came less than 24 hours before Sarkisian and the rest of the new staff was set to meet members of the media before the coaches set out to recruit for the rest of the month.
Davis became just the latest Trojan defector during an offseason that has seen five players forego their senior seasons and enter the NFL Draft: safety Dion Bailey, tight end Xavier Grimble, wide receiver Marqise Lee, center Marcus Martin and defensive lineman George Uko. Redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard’s announcement that he would return for his senior season was a welcome surprise, but overall the early goings of 2014 have seen major members of the team depart.
Which brings me to the biggest void of all– — the one left by former interim head coach Ed Orgeron. Regardless of whether or not you believe Coach O deserved to be the next head coach instead of Sarkisian, nothing felt quite right about the manner in which his tenure at USC came to an end. Reports of a “livid” Orgeron storming out of the McKay Center might not be completely accurate, but the situation was much too uncomfortable for a man who’d spent a decade with the school, saved the 2013 season from disaster and will go down as, “one of the greatest Trojans ever,” according to Athletic Director Pat Haden.
Davis’ departure, however, leaves the door ever so slightly cracked open for a new ending to the Orgeron saga. USC is now in need of a new defensive line coach, and current recruiting coordinator Peter Sirmon, whose title also includes linebackers coach and Associate Head Coach of Defense, is just 36 years old and only has Division I college coaching experience as a graduate assistant at Oregon in 2009. Orgeron’s return would certainly be considered an upgrade, especially with only a few weeks remaining until National Signing Day.
As ideal as it might sound, this scenario makes much more sense on paper than it does in reality. There would be inevitable awkwardness around the program after Orgeron abruptly left the team three weeks before the Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl, upset that he was not retained as head coach. One would think that, after experiencing success as USC’s head man for two months, Orgeron had his sights set on landing another head coaching job elsewhere.
But with most of the high-profile coaching searches completed, it appears unlikely that Orgeron will lead another team onto the field in 2014. Rumors had swirled recently about him following former USC head coach Lane Kiffin to Alabama, where Kiffin was recently named the Tide’s new offensive coordinator, joining Nick Saban’s staff, but that will obviously not happen now that Davis has made the move to Tuscaloosa.
With Orgeron running out of time and options, a return to USC might not seem like such a bad idea from his perspective, especially if Haden is still interested in making him one of the highest paid assistant coaches in college football, as he said was his intention after Sarkisian’s hiring.
Bringing Orgeron back would certainly be seen as a huge win for Sarkisian by current players and fans, whose support for Coach O was overwhelming during the second half of the season. Team leaders, such as Pullard and redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, were passionate in their support for Orgeron and would definitely welcome him back with open arms.
Orgeron’s ego is the determining factor in this hypothetical decision — would he be willing to return to a lesser position, once again having to serve under a former USC assistant coach? That much is known only by Orgeron himself. I can only imagine that it would be tough to go back to being an assistant, even a highly paid one, after proving to himself that he’s capable of leading a program.
It wouldn’t be an easy return, but it would make sense to all parties involved. Orgeron has been compared to legendary USC coach Marv Goux, a lifetime assistant known as “Mr. Trojan” who was revered for his toughness and competitiveness. Despite never getting an opportunity to be head coach, Goux is among the most beloved Trojans of all time. Orgeron’s place in USC lore has yet to be determined, but a return to the school would go a long way in cementing his legacy as a true Trojan great.

Nice article, Nick. We will see if Coach O’s ego will get in the way of the best decision for him financially and his Trojan legacy. Haden’s offer to him previously reflected the high respect that USC has for him even if he didn’t see it that way. No other school is going to give him a better offer.
Come on Coach O … welcome back home.

Head coach Bill Ferguson promises that this year’s USC men’s volleyball team looks more like the team from two years ago than last year’s squad. The 2012 squad finished 26-7, won the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference championship and went all the way to the NCAA national championship game. Last year’s team finished 6-18 and failed to make the playoffs.
Set-up · Junior setter Micah Christenson has led the Trojans with 12.57 assists per set in their first two games against UCSD and Loyola-Chicago. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
With a bevy of young talent along with more experienced veterans, Ferguson is confident that last year’s struggles were an aberration and that the program is back to a level of national prominence. He’s certain that this is the year that the Trojans win the national title that has eluded Ferguson his past seven seasons at the helm in Southern California.
“This team is most like our 2012 team,” he said. “That group and this group are the most built as a team. Everybody understands their roles, we have pretty heavy competition at a lot of positions and it really is a fun team to coach.”
The team has looked very solid through its first two games this year and Ferguson even added that this might be his best team ever at USC.
“This team has more all-around skill and cohesion than any group I’ve had here,” he said. “I believe we’ll take a large step toward being back in the national conversation.”
Like the 2012 squad, Ferguson said the team is led by arguably the best player in the country as well as an outstanding freshman. Two years ago, outside hitter Tony Ciarelli was named the national player of the year by American Volleyball Coaches Association, and stud freshman setter Micah Christenson led the Trojans to the NCAA final. Unfortunately for the Trojans, they lost in the final and have not won a championship since 1990.
Christenson, who was the starting setter for the U.S. Men’s National Team last fall, is now a candidate for player of the year himself. He also has a rising star to smash his sets in freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder. Ferguson said that Christenson was the “alpha” of the team and described Yoder as “a very talented freak show of a freshman.”
Ferguson said that Christenson has his starting spot locked down and that Yoder will likely start as well, but he is still trying to decide who will start in most of the other positions. He said that sophomore Alex Slaught, redshirt freshman Christopher Orenic and Yoder would likely battle for the two outside hitter spots; junior Robert Feathers, freshman Andy Benesh and junior Chris Lischke will split the two middle blocker positions; redshirt seniors Tanner Jansen and Maddison McKibbin will tandem at opposite and senior Henry Cassiday will take the majority of the starts at libero for his fourth straight year, though sophomore Brooks Varni may get some starts there as well.
Almost all of last year’s team has returned for this season, including a few players who missed substantial playing time due to injury. Ferguson said that a combination of inexperience and injuries contributed to the Trojans’ poor performance last year, and that many returning players have already seen big improvements over last season.
“We built depth and we built character,” he said of last year’s group.
Ferguson said he plans to run almost exclusively a 5-1 formation, where Christenson will be the only setter on the floor. Cassiday will substitute for one of the middle blockers, rather than a 6-2 formation where two setters who can occupy the floor together.
Two games into their 2014 campaign, USC has matched its coach’s praise with solid wins over Loyola-Chicago and UC San Diego.
On Jan. 10, the Trojans only needed three sets to defeat UCSD during the Trojans’ home opener by a score of 25-17, 25-23, 25-22. Slaught led the team in kills with 14, Yoder added 13 and middles McKibbin and Benesh each had eight. Christenson had 42 assists as well as three service aces.
“It felt great,” Christenson said. “It’s great to finally get into Galen [Center] for a regular conference home game and we’re excited for more.”
Though snowstorms across the Midwest cancelled the Trojans’ matchup with Lewis University, poor weather couldn’t stop the Trojans from beating No. 2 Loyola-Chicago in four sets in Chicago on Jan. 4. Yoder led the Trojans with 16 kills that night during the 27-25, 18-25, 25-20, 25-15 win and was named the AVCA player of the week for his performance.
The 2014 NCAA Final Four will be held in Chicago, and it’s no coincidence that Ferguson organized a team trip out to the city this year.
Redshirt junior serving specialist Paul Yoder, cousin of Lucas and older brother of freshman setter Jack Yoder, said the team wants nothing more than to return to Chicago this year and bring home a national title.
“That’s where we want to be,” he said. “That’s the end goal, and we’re going to do everything we can to get there.”
The Trojans have played in three Final Fours and two national championship games since Ferguson took over, but he has yet to win the title. In the 2009, 2012 and 2013 national championship games, UC Irvine took home the crown. The seventh-ranked Anteaters, who will come in as the two-time defending national champions, return to the Galen Center today in what should be another great MPSF matchup.
“They are a superb team in the middle,” Ferguson said. “They’ve got a lot of guys on that roster that have won a couple national championships.”
The matchup, which might determine who comes out as the No. 1 team in the country in next week’s rankings, begins at 7 p.m.

USC junior linebacker Hayes Pullard will return to USC for his final season of NCAA eligibility. The team captain started all 14 games for the Trojans in 2013, recording 94 total tackles and one interception. Pullard was consistently ranked as one of the top 10 NFL prospects at linebacker, partly due to his performance in big games.
One more year · Linebacker Hayes Pullard recorded 94 total tackles and one interception during the 2013 season, and will start for the fourth consecutive year. The team captain shined in crucial games. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
The Los Angeles native picked up 12 tackles in the team’s stunning upset of Stanford on Nov. 16, and 14 more two weeks later against UCLA. Perhaps Pullard’s most memorable performance came in 2011, when the then-true freshman recorded 14 tackles and two sacks in the Trojans’ thrilling 38-35 win over Oregon. Pullard has amassed 282 tackles, six sacks and two interceptions over the past three seasons.
New defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox will certainly be happy to see Pullard return. The junior helped anchor a defense that held opponents to 21.2 points per game in 2013, good for a top-20 national ranking. That unit, however, may be in flux after the events of this offseason. Along the defensive line, tackle George Uko has chosen to forego his senior season while defensive end Morgan Breslin will be lost to graduation. That duo combined for 9.5 sacks this season. Pullard will headline a strong linebacking corps that also returns senior Lamar Dawson, redshirt junior Anthony Sarao and redshirt sophomore Scott Starr. No longer in the mix is graduated senior Devon Kennard, who led the team with nine sacks this season. In the secondary, cornerback Torin Harris will also be lost to graduation. Key returners include sophomore safeties Su’a Cravens and Leon McQuay III along with junior cornerback Kevon Seymour. Safety Josh Shaw has yet to announce whether he will return for his final year of eligibility.
Pullard will also be the lone captain to return to Steve Sarkisian’s 2014 squad. Along with Kennard, center Marcus Martin and wide receiver Marqise Lee have also entered the draft. A fifth Trojan, redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble, also chose to leave for the NFL.
The most promising NFL prospect is Lee, a former All-American and Biletnikoff Award winner whose 2013 performance was hampered by injuries. Lee caught 57 passes for 791 yards and four touchdowns this season, following his record-breaking 118-catch, 1721-yard and 14 -touchdown 2012 season. Close to full health, Lee caught 7 passes for 118 yards and two touchdowns in his final performance against Fresno State in the Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl. The potential first-round draft pick finished his career owning or tying 22 USC records along with the Pac-12 career record for receptions. Martin, Uko, Grimble and Bailey are expected to be third or fourth-round selections.
USC has produced 480 NFL draft picks and 77 overall picks, both national records.

In late December, Phil Robertson, family patriarch of the hit A&E show Duck Dynasty, was suspended for controversial comments he made about black people and gay people to the men’s magazine GQ. The statements made by Robertson, however, ended up saying more about society’s cultural reaction to someone voicing an unpopular opinion than it did of Robertson’s individual beliefs.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
The First Amendment states, “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech,” and this basic sentiment allows us to draw two conclusions. The first is that A&E was well within their constitutional right to suspend Robertson from the show. A&E is a private network that can choose to suspend, fire or otherwise punish an employee who presumably violates his or her contract with the network. So those decrying the downfall of the First Amendment might want to pump the brakes.
The second conclusion that can be drawn is about hypocrisy. Those on the anti-Christian side (a safe categorization, seeing as Robertson based his statements on the Bible) came out saying A&E didn’t go far enough and that they should have fired Robertson and his family for their beliefs. Unfortunately for those worrying about the downfall of human rights at Robertson’s hands, the First Amendment has nothing to do with being offended. It doesn’t say, “Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech … unless your feelings get hurt or you disagree in any way.”
Before gay marriage became the widely accepted cultural movement it is today, those in support of it faced the same “just stop talking” sentiment critics are now throwing at people such as Phil Robertson. How easily people forget the value of being able to express their opinions when those opinions become culturally popular. How easily they toss around the word “bigot” without realizing it has a far more widespread application than they care to admit.
“Bigot”, according to Merriam-Webster, is a person who is intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices.
Just as those who disagree with Robertson on the issue of gay marriage want to change freedom of speech to only include the things they find palatable, they also want to change the word bigot to only apply to those with religious convictions.
And “prejudice”, according to Merriam-Webster, is a preformed opinion, usually an unfavorable one, based on insufficient knowledge, irrational feelings or inaccurate stereotypes.
Having clarified prejudice, we can now more accurately define a bigot as someone who is intolerantly devoted to his or her own negative opinions. But is it not bigoted to decide anyone who doesn’t support gay marriage is hateful and intolerant? Attacking Phil Robertson for his choice to exercise his own freedom of speech and his own freedom of religion allows people to misuse the word bigot and pervert a constitution they claim is being perverted and misrepresent a religion they’ve taken just enough time to learn so they can make a comment about whether or not Robertson should eat shellfish.
At all costs ,the people calling those who oppose gay marriage bigoted have to keep going. Because those who like to use the word bigoted conveniently spend so much time attacking the rest of the population that they haven’t looked in the mirror long enough to realize that their behavior and language makes them exactly the boogeyman they’re scared of — people intolerantly devoted to a preformed negative opinion about an entire group of people.
So maybe it’s time to take a step back and look at our own behavior. Before deciding someone is a redneck or a bigot for not agreeing with a culturally popular opinion, we should look at how we express those beliefs. Before calling people names like a nation of third graders, we should take a minute to evaluate whether those words come from our own place of bigotry.
After that, we can talk about the shellfish thing.

Hey-, if one party wants to publicly decree their beliefs, then they should be ready to deal with the response. Our inalienable right to freedom of speech not only protects those who chose to discuss their beliefs, but also protects those who choose to respond. Asking the latter to reconsider what they say, while defending the words of the former, seems a bit hypocritical. 
Also, someone is considered a “bigot” because of their intolerance. When someone speaks out against something, I would consider that being intolerant and so would most people.
I said I do NOT want to change freedom of speech. The author claims I do want to change freedom of speech. He said this…”those who disagree with Robertson on the issue of gay marriage want to change freedom of speech…”
This is not well written and is just plain Wrong.  D-
You definitely should NOT want to change freedom of speech. That is exactly the freedom by which a group of people have been permitted to cram their agenda down the throats of every TV watching American since at least the first episode of Will and Grace. The exact same conduit by which the Robertson’s are reaching out to their group. 
I believe what Calum is eluding to in this article is the need for tolerance, not to point blame or “lump” anyone into a group. The division will ALWAYS be there, so long as either of both sides are ignorant to that point. Furthermore, Robertson said nothing to foster intolerance.
I totally agree with you. The Founding Fathers of our country gave every right to Phil to say what he wants. Think about it in the opposite direction: do TV networks suspend actors for admitting to being gay? No. They have the freedom of speech and of religion. They are perfectly legal, and should speak as they wish on TV. Directors encourage it, even. When Phil simply quotes the Bible in his words and states what he feels (not necessarily the rest of the Robinson family’s opinion), he gets thrown out with hundreds of thousands of people slandering him. All I can note is that the early presidents that we respect and appreciate would shake their head in shame at what we are as a country today.
As President Lincoln said, “A house divided among itself cannot stand.” We’re trying to do two things: hate on people with beliefs, and cherish people coming out, being who they are and what they believe in.
To make it worse, the TV editors are editing the Duck Dynasty show to please one crowd, displeasing the other. Bleeps were added to “hide profanity”, but Phil and his family had never used such language. Those who want to watch the show because it’s seemingly one of the only clean, family-friendly shows on cable anymore should be able to watch a series portraying their beliefs. If you think it’s too “sissy” or “religious”, then you don’t have to watch it. Simply grab the remote and switch the channel. You don’t have to raise a riot to express how you dislike a character on the show.
What’s going to be the next step? Are sermons given on TV networks going to be blocked as well? It’s the same thing: a pastor expresses the Word of God; an actor expresses the Word of God. The only difference is that Phil Robertson is famous.
God does not hate gays. Christians…well, those who truly interpret the Bible correctly… don’t hate gays, either. Christians love everything that God has made, and God made humans. Jesus was sent to Earth for this very reason. He even hung out with these people. Prostitutes, murderers, taxmen (who in that time were pro liars, thieves, and plain cruel) was his crowd. Just because a Christian doesn’t do homosexuality doesn’t mean that they hate gay people. Instead they beg gays to go to church with them. Not to just repent, either. Christians hope to show them how to please and love God, and show true roots of the Bible. Yes, homosexuality is stated as a sin in the Bible. Yes, this displeases God. But God still loves His creation, and just hopes that the gay community comes to a revelation.
If you think about it, gay people weren’t gay from the beginning; since birth, for example. If God made the universe, He made us; and He did not design only males, just as He didn’t just make women. No, He made women for men. He did not make men with female “parts”, nor visa-versa. He specifically made man for woman and woman for man, if you think about natural desires and the human body.
Some people argue that they have natural desires for the opposite sex. Yes, that forms over time, depending on your environment. Who you grew up with, like family and friends, greatly determines who you are. If you grew up without the opposite sex having interest in you, it would be easy to understand that you would naturally turn to other options. Or maybe you just find your sex attractive. Yeah, the opposite sex does, too. If you continue to feed that flame, though, it becomes a sin, according to the Bible. I’m not going to go into great length on this small topic, but if you think about it, you will know where I’m coming from.
We were born into the world as sinners. It’s natural. The Bible says this, too. But what makes Christianity is how you choose to live your life. No one is going to be sinless, but Christians try to keep the number of sins down. They choose to follow what the Bible says what to do and what not to do. That’s all that Phil Robertson was trying to say. He is choosing to live a life according to how God made him and for his purpose. He believes that to lie with your same sex is a sin, just as God believes. He should not have been put to shame for having beliefs and a voice.
I have thought about and I have researched it and yes gays are indeed supposed to be gay. And how does that come about? Certain chemicals are released in different quantities on the fetus. The same goes for tomboys and ‘metrosexuals”  (Not a great name), We all are different amounts of masculine and feminine attributes. Just like our hair colour, height, handedness is pre-determined long before we make our debut. So if the mother is responsible for the chemical mix we inherit, what shall we do now? If you were to do some research you would find out that there was a very good reason to dislike gays. The Romans were power-hungry and wished to gain as much territory as they could. That meant going to battle. And they needed soldiers. Now in Roman times there was a specific practice of older men being intimate with younger males.  The end result was that less males were born. So the Romans had to figure out a way to curb the practice pagans were partaking in. They came to the conclusion that if they could bring the church on board and make it immoral, then they would get their boys to bolster their ranks. So it was made a “sin”. And that is the root of the acrimony against gays.
Interestingly enough, there was a practice when I was growing up where the village priest would make his rounds to persuade the first born son to become a priest. or at the very least pester the mother into making the commitment! In some places it was expected. See the pattern? The first born may be most unsuitable for the role of social worker.
There are ironies over the stance Christianity takes on the matter. I have an uncle who became a priest-everyone loved him until the good father molested both a girl and a boy. Gay priests are not pedophiles so children are safe with them. It’s a committed gay couple that will adopt the baby of a the poor 16 -year old who is in over her head. Not the pro-lifers. And the biggest irony of all-I would rather have dinner with men who happen to be gay than to break break with ignorant (in both sense of the word) folk who don’t know the the fine line between free speech and hate speech. Just because you CAN say something does not mean you OUGHT to…Mr Robertson can say what he likes but he has to accept that there may be push back.. I am disappointed in him- I really thought he was smarter than that.  I will never understand why people get so uptight about gay marriage – it has nothing to do with you personally so learn to tolerate or better yet accept reality. You will like yourself much better at  the end of the day..
I told my wife they had an agenda when I saw assault weapons and a family prayer in the same episode.  For those of you that like red neck entertainment without the Christian right agenda I suggest  Fat Cops.
Change a word from his statement and let’s see what is was like just 40 years ago. 
“Start with interracial relationships and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.”
Would you like it if people likened your interracial relationship as a step toward beastiality?
“””Just as those who disagree with Robertson on the issue of gay marriage want to change freedom of speech to only include the things they find palatable, they also want to change the word bigot to only apply to those with religious convictions.””” – 
Where do you get this? I and plenty of others that disagree with Robertson on the issue of gay marriage do NOT want to change freedom of speech to only include the things we find palatable. I bet you hate to be lumped in with a group you feel is wrong but you feel oh so comfortable doing it to others.

As the clock struck midnight on Jan. 1, a new year also meant a new opportunity for 36-year-old Sergio Garcia. On Jan. 2, the California Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a Mexican immigrant can be licensed as a lawyer, even if he or she doesn’t have a green card, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Born in Mexico, Garcia came to the United States with his parents when he was a teenager to pick almonds on a farm. His father was a permanent legal resident and attempted to sign a petition to receive an immigrant visa for his son in 1994. Due to the volume of applications filed by immigrants from Mexico at the time, Garcia never received a visa number.
Garcia went on to law school and passed the California State Bar Exam. California state law, however, prohibited undocumented immigrants from being granted professional licenses from government agencies or with the use of public funds. State lawmakers in Sacramento crafted a law that permits illegal immigrants to receive licenses for situations similar to Garcia’s.
Despite now having a license, it is unclear where Garcia can practice law, as he is still barred from being hired at law firms or any company because of his undocumented status. The court stated, however, that he could practice law in California on a pro bono basis.
It is surprising to see the struggle it took Garcia to receive his rightfully deserved law license in California, given the state’s record of progressive reform. Even the White House opposed his case. The Obama administration, which has supported immigrants in the past with measures such as the Dream Act, took the surprising position citing a 1996 federal law similar to the one in California.
Ostensibly, it is easy to see why the state of California shouldn’t grant a professional law license to an illegal immigrant. They are in this country illegally and should therefore not be granted the rights and privileges given to citizens. Such a narrow view of the issue, however, fosters this perpetual cycle that Garcia’s case brings to the foreground — -that of vital immigration reform and a discussion on how immigrants are treated in this country.
Garcia went to college, earned an undergraduate degree, then went to law school and passed the bar on his first attempt. That’s more than what a fifth of test-takers who fail their first time can say. The argument that Garcia’s undocumented status precludes him from practicing law is muted when one considers his extraordinary achievements. As such, the court recognized that Garcia “possesses the requisite good moral character” to be admitted to the state bar.
Garcia did not arrive to the United States on his own accord. Like millions of others, he was brought here by his parents in search of a better life, a philosophy that built this country and that is deeply rooted and interwoven into the fabric of the American creed. Garcia’s case should be viewed as a microcosm of everything that is wrong with the immigration system in America, both at the federal and state level.
The mechanisms of the immigration system are highly outdated and convoluted and, as a result, inhibit the path to citizenship that many desire. Talk of amnesty and deportation fail to muster support when considering systemic flaws. Why should those already present in the state be penalized? A point of no return has already been reached and a massive deportation effort would be unfeasible at best. Border control must be made potent yet simplified. State and federal agents need to cooperate in order to more effectively guard the nation’s borders.
Laws that discriminate against minority groups, such as Arizona’s controversial immigration law passed in 2010, exacerbate the issue rather than solve it. The discourse on immigration reform needs to center on how to manage undocumented immigrants within the border already, how to prevent further illegal immigration through border control, a simplified path to citizenship and a more concerted effort by federal and state officials to work together to enforce policy.
2014 marks the next round of midterm elections and it is unlikely that California will see any change in immigration policy. In today’s deeply polarized and hyper-pluralized political image, legislative agendas are not dictated by priority or need, but rather by political opportunity and gain. Cases similar to Garcia’s, however, offer a glimmer of hope that judicial policymaking might be an effective avenue to exact change in immigration.

When Jahi McMath’s parents took her to the Children’s Hospital & Research Center Oakland on Dec. 9 for a tonsillectomy, they were hopeful that the procedure would improve McMath’s airflow during her sleep at night, according to the Los Angeles Times. The last thing they were expecting was that their 13-year-old daughter was going to become brain dead due to complications from this supposedly routine procedure.
The tragic story of what happened to McMath has sparked much debate within the medical community regarding the ethics of life support and the exact definition of “brain dead,” and has demonstrated the need for a better definition of medical death.
Though she was conscious and recovering from the surgeries, McMath was moved to the intensive care unit where she began to bleed from her nose and mouth before eventually going into cardiac arrest. Doctors at the hospital declared her brain dead, meaning that she was legally dead and would be taken off of life support. Her parents insisted on keeping her on life support, maintaining their belief that their daughter would fight and come back to life.
Because McMath was declared legally dead by the Alameda Family Coroner on Dec. 12, doctors did not want to keep her on life support. The issue was brought to court to determine whether McMath was alive or dead, according to California law’s definition of brain dead. The judge granted the parents’ wishes to keep her on life support, primarily to help them deal with the grief of losing their daughter, even though California law states that if the brain is dead, the person is dead. McMath’s body was kept in the hospital for a short while subsequent to the court order, but was then transferred to an unnamed facility on Jan. 7 where her parents said she is receiving much better care, according to CNN.
This debate over whether McMath has any chance of coming back to life if kept on life support is positive for our society but horrible for McMath’s family. This case is forcing both medical professionals and government officials to more clearly define what it means to be “dead,” as well as clarifying the difference between being brain dead, being in a coma and being in a persistent vegetative state. In contrast to being comatose or vegetative, brain dead means that the person is dead and nothing can change the outcome. Perhaps doctors should refrain from using the term “brain dead” completely in order to avoid confusion, and rather refer to their patients as either dead or alive.
There needs to be more well-defined and clear laws stating the difference between brain death and actual death, and what should be done when a patient no longer has brain activity. Once laws are more clear and widely recognized, families will no longer have to endure the agonizing pain of wondering if their child will come back to life.
It is completely understandable that McMath’s parents are in shock over what happened to their daughter. They brought their daughter in for a common procedure, unaware that they were putting her life at risk and now have to deal with the worst possible outcome. Many argue that keeping her on life support is helping them deal with the grief and allowing them to come to terms with their daughter’s death at a slower pace. Several medical experts, however, argue that this gives the parents a false sense of hope — that keeping their daughter on a ventilator merely creates an illusion of life.
“This is basically organ support; it’s not life support. Her organs are alive, but she’s not alive. Her organs are slowly dying. Her fate is written; it’s just a question of when everything fails,” Dr. Neal E. Slatkin, a neurologist and chief medical officer at San Jose’s Hospice of the Valley, told the Contra Costa Times.
It’s a terrible reality that McMath’s parents are having a difficult time accepting. Supporters of the McMath family are saying that parents have every right to keep Jahi on a ventilator if they have the finances to do so. Though the McMaths have received a lot of donations to keep their daughter on life support, the money will eventually run out and Jahi’s body will continue to decay, as it has already begun, according to the Los Angeles Times. By pumping oxygen through a corpse of a young girl, the hospital is draining its medical staff and resources, allowing the family to hold onto a thread of false hope and prolonging the appropriate memorial service for a young girl who passed away too soon.

Read the above.
Absolutely NO documented cases of recovery from brain death.  Mis diagnosis?  Yep…rare.  Brain death = death.
Izzy, why are you are getting this wrong, a month after the issue erupted all over the news and the net?  
It was NOT a “simple tonsillectomy” … it was “Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty” … a complicated remodelling of the girl’s nasal passages, soft palate and upper throat. (please see Wikipedia)  During that surgery, not only were her tonsild and adenoids removed, but the nasal turbinates were surgically remodelled as was the uvula.   Her parents would have been informed of the planned surgery, and the risks. They would have read and signed the consent forms for the surgery.
“There needs to be more well-defined and clear laws stating the difference between brain death and actual death, and what should be done when a patient no longer has brain activity. ” 
Brain death is “actual death”. There is no difference. If you die because of cardiac arrest (heart stops, brain loses blood supply and dies), respiratory failure (breathing stops, heart and brain die from lack or oxygen), or massive damage to your brain and brainstem stops your breathing and your heart then stops from lack of oxygen …. you are dead.  
California law already addresses the issue of what to do when patients lose brain and brainstem activity.
Actually, there are a few cases in the literature over the last several decades of supposed brain death reversal – mainly in infants and fetuses (where you may still have an active neurogenesis niche) – none ever had positive long term outcome, but the papers do exists in PubMed if you look for them – and they are hotly contested amongst thought leaders – And do keep in mind, the brain death diagnosis does NOT constitute zero cerebral activity as is commonly mentioned in the press – it is “no cerebral activity greater than 2 micro-volts” – most thought leaders in the space acknowledge residual “nests” of neuronal activity and residual blood flow do indeed exist in the brain dead – just not enough to support an “integrated whole person” – Since 1968 and the Harvard Ad Hoc Committee on Brain Death, the definition of death has remained static, in spite of 1) the major thought leaders in the space acknowledging that brain death is a process, not an event, and 2) the continued development of new technologies, including those of regenerative medicine – and on top of that, even in the year 2014 we really have no widely accepted idea on how memories are truly stored in the brain, and how much of the brain can be destroyed while maintaining identity – Ira S Pastor, CEO, Bioquark Inc.

A New Year is almost always a catalyst for some kind of change: Some might seek to lose those 10 extra bothersome pounds and take up yoga, while others have decided to limit their Facebook usage. The New Year is a time when one can look back at their life and make promises and turn it all around. It’s time for a change, to be the best people we can be.
In 2014, there will be less partying and more going to class, less Panda Express and more Seeds. We’ll make more of an effort to go to that fraternity event or trivia night at Tommy’s Place. It’s time for spring cleaning. We’ll finally talk to that cute girl in our G.E., but not before learning French because, honestly, who can resist?
And for some reason, humans are only capable of making these resolutions on Jan. 1.
But these resolutions tend to break as soon as you realize just how much you miss Chipotle, because we, as a species, as a race, as a people, find it difficult to adapt. We become comfortable with the regular, and when given the choice between a rocky road filled with question marks and an easier one involving a couch and the Bravo network, the decision is pretty clear.
One could say that the journalism industry is in a similar predicament. After years of existing as the only way for the people to get news (cue “Extra! Extra! Read all about it!”), radio came into play. Soon after, the television made its way into people’s living rooms. And now computers, tablets, phones and more are becoming the dominant way people get information.
News sources have tried to keep up with this change: They create apps and write polls, they have audiences ask questions to dignitaries over Twitter. But no matter how much they might try to keep up, it’s almost as if we’re dogs trying to catch their tails — it’s just out of reach.
USC, not unlike the current journalism industry, is in a constant state of change. As the Editorial Board pointed out in last semester’s orientation issue, “With each decade, and each new leader, USC’s image has changed.” Campus Centers have gone up, security fences have magically appeared, head football coaches have disappeared and President C. L. Max Nikias has proposed a new vision for the University Village.
This continual modification and adaptation is part of what makes USC so special. Though there is more than enough to be grateful for, we still want — and deserve — the best. Through hard work and determination, we’ve gone from the University of Spoiled Children to one of the leading universities in the world.
We’ve made a resolution of our own here at the Daily Trojan (and no, we’re not giving up Panda Express). We want to strive to be not just the best that we can be, but the best news source possible. We want to be the first place you look to for a new film review or a breaking news story. And in order to do that, we need to change a bit.
This semester, look out for our new graphic ideas, our wider range of topics and, most importantly, our website. We understand that you want your news on the go and we’re here to serve. Multimedia content such as podcasts, videos and interactive maps will be created and posted for you to peruse while waiting in the long line at Lemonade.
We hope that you’ll cheer us on and support us as you have for over a century. We’re here to serve you, whether you’re a student or professor, administrator, alumnus, fan or green vest handing out fliers to dodging students on Trousdale.
So yes, we’re making a resolution, and this year, we’re going to keep it.

College students have been a historic force in advocating for an end to conflicts across the world. This year is an opportunity to do so once more. Since peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians resumed in July, Secretary of State John Kerry has made more than 10 trips to the region, returning from the most recent round of negotiations last week. Yet even though Kerry has brought leaders from both sides to the negotiating table, U.S. students at college campuses such as USC have embarked on pointless blame games.
Matthew Torres | Daily Trojan
USC campus organizations, such as USC Students for Justice in Palestine and ‘SC Students for Israel, have hosted numerous events about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Though these events bring different voices to campus, few are co-sponsored by USC SJP and Hillel or SCSI, and as such, members from each of these organizations rarely attend the events of the other. As a result, these events become poorly attended forums for a one-sided discussion about the conflict, leaving the only opportunity for engagement to the occasional protest on Trousdale Parkway.
This polarity was especially prevalent during SJP’s Palestine Awareness Week last spring, during which students in SJP conducted a mock checkpoint to simulate the Israeli security barriers through which West Bank residents must pass in order to enter Israel proper. Rather than address the real problems that arise from these checkpoints, members of SCSI stood across the plaza, holding Israeli flags and signs. Their frustration with the mock checkpoints was understandable, yet contributed to a week already full of misunderstandings and inefficiencies. With neither group effectively addressing the concerns of the other, the entire campus community lost a valuable opportunity to support the U.S.-led negotiations in the region and serve as an example to deeply divided campuses across the country.
The polarizing nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on campuses isn’t just a USC problem — USC is just a microcosm of what is currently taking place on the world stage. But if these difficult conversations can happen at the international level between Israeli and Palestinian leadership, there’s no reason they can’t occur on college campuses, where the stakes are lower and the culture of education and engaging with new ideas is omnipresent.
The return to the negotiating table by Israeli and Palestinian leaders presents another opportunity for college students to stand united in support for peace, and USC students — regardless of faith or ethnicity — should not miss this chance.
At many universities, this work has already begun. A growing number of organizations like J Street U, the student arm of a national organization that advocates for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has already brought challenging and thoughtful discussions about the the conflict to 49 universities in the United States. The J Street U chapter at UCLA, for example, recently hosted an event called Conflict 101. It brought students from across the political spectrum to discuss the conflict and examine the different narratives within it. If our crosstown rivals can engage in these difficult conversations, there’s no reason USC students shouldn’t.
College students have always played a critical role in facilitating social change. The current round of peace talks — negotiations which have thus far failed under four U.S. presidents — should not and cannot be taken lightly.
It is easy to distance oneself from difficult topics such as this conflict. It is easy to be overwhelmed by the fact that millions of Israelis continue to live under the fear of rocket fire from the Gaza Strip and millions of Palestinians continue to live under military occupation. But claiming to be apolitical or failing to support the difficult compromises needed to reach peace does more harm than good.
For this reason, fostering open and constructive dialogue that encourages students to take real political action towards peace is fundamentally important. Whether USC students are more concerned with Israeli security or Palestinian human rights, they must join with a diverse range of their peers in support of the ongoing negotiations.
By spearheading initiatives like J Street’s 2 Campaign, which encourages students to grapple with the key issues that come up in negotiations, USC students can begin the type of dialogue our campus so desperately needs. In doing so, they can ultimately help in this seemingly intractable conflict’s endless pursuit of peace.
From the #USChangeMovement to public forums discussing the university’s drinking culture, USC students have never backed away from difficult conversations. As students across the nation begin to wrestle with the difficult dialogue surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, USC students should refuse to be left behind.
 
Yasmeen Serhan is a sophomore majoring in international relations. She is also the Editorial Director of the Daily Trojan.
 
As a former president of SC Students for Israel, I would like to correct the notion that efforts for dialogue have not been made on the USC campus. During my time at USC and as president and vice president of SCSI, we made a number of efforts to reach out to SJP and have an open dialogue about the Arab-Israeli conflict. Unfortunately, those requests were denied. Not only were they denied, but an environment that pushed us away from dialogue was created when SJP members would walk on campus and refer to members of SCSI, including myself, as “dirty zionists” or “baby killers.” I think I speak for most SCSI members when I say that we support dialogue and peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians. However, to reach those talks we need to establish an environment on campus where people feel safe to express their opinions without the risk of being labeled a “baby killer.” Unfortunately events like Palestinian Awareness Week with its mock “Apartheid Wall” and checkpoints, only works to demonize Israel and  push these 2 students groups even further apart. As a former pro-Israel Trojan, I can tell you that for me dialogue became impossible as soon as SJP members told me that Israel doesn’t have a right to exist. At that point, what more is there to talk about.
Great article.

At approximately 12:15 Monday morning, a shooting occurred that left one person injured on Raymond Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard, just west of the University Park Campus.
Officer Rosario Herrera of the Los Angeles Police Department’s media relations office said the victim, a black male, was shot multiple times by a Hispanic suspect and transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
“The suspect is still outstanding,” Herrera said. “He’s not in custody and the motive for the shooting is unknown.”
USC’s Department of Public Safety responded to assist LAPD officers in creating a perimeter around the neighborhood.
Carlisle said it appeared that a suspect had been taken into custody early this morning, but Herrera said LAPD doesn’t have a record of an arrest being made.
“[LAPD] suspected the shooter was still in the area,” DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said. “LAPD did utilize their canines and a suspect was taken into custody.’”

Dr. Michelson, a retired orthopedic spinal surgeon, has over 955 issued or pending patents to date, as well as a place in the National Inventors Hall of Fame.
The Michelson Center will bring together the brightest minds from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering and the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. The schools will work together at the Center to research the convergence between biology and engineering.
The university plans to build the Michelson Center on the southwest corner of the University Park Campus, and Nikias said the new building will house state-of-the-art flexible labs, a Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis, and a nano fabrication facility, among other labs.
Nikias spoke of the importance of interdisciplinary research to the crowd of students and faculty that gathered for the announcement at Town and Gown.
“One of the most important parts of education is our dedication to interdisciplinary research,” Nikias said. “At many other universities, ‘interdisciplinary’ is no more than a buzzword. USC turns colleges from diverse disciplines into creative collaboration.”
Dr. Michelson thanked the USC community for agreeing to host the institute and spoke to the importance of research that makes an impact on the world, not research for sake of research alone.
“The [Michelson Center] will converge research to produce real world breakthroughs in real time,” he said. “This is going to be a grand adventure, and we thank you.”
