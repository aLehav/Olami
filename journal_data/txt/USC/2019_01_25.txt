2018 saw some of the most ambitious achievements in the video game industry yet. Beautiful indies came alive in the platformer “Celeste” and the rogue-like “Dead Cells.” Epic single-player narratives thrived more than ever with the successes of “God of War”, “Spider-Man” and “Assassin”s Creed Odyssey,” along with the groundbreaking blockbuster “Red Dead Redemption 2.” It might be too early to say, but 2018 may have cemented itself as one of the best years in gaming yet. 
2019 will be the swan song for the current generation of consoles — the next generation of gaming hardware is set for release in 2020. With several video games showing great promise, 2019 may even have a shot at topping its predecessor. 
“Resident Evil 2”
Release Date: Jan. 25
Raccoon City is coming back with a remake of the classic survival horror game “Resident Evil 2.” Unlike most revivals and remasters, the January issue is a completely new game built from the ground up. Capcom went out of its way to ensure this game terrifies even the most die-hard fans of the series. Given the age of the original, the developers of the remake added brand new sections and gameplay, making it a must-buy for new and old fans alike. The game adapts the over-the-shoulder perspective, emphasizing horror over action. Every single trailer and gameplay preview has been highly impressive, making expectations for the game’s release high. 
“Kingdom Hearts III”
Release Date: Jan. 29
To say that “Kingdom Hearts III” is a long time coming would be a massive understatement: Square Enix announced the title at E3 2013. To put that in perspective, the game was announced before the current generation of consoles was even released — now, that same generation is likely in its final year. Regardless, the wacky and convoluted story of “Kingdom Hearts” makes it a wondrous world to play through. The game series combines characters from Square Enix, Disney and Pixar into one massive story of good and evil. With the new game, players will be able to explore many different sandbox worlds, including those of “Toy Story” and “Pirates of the Caribbean,” as well as newer films like “Tangled” and Frozen.”
“Anthem”
Release Date: Feb. 22
Probably the biggest mystery of early 2019 video game releases is “Anthem.” Announced at E3 2017, this game is a big question mark for watchful gamers. On one hand, EA, who publishes the game, has notoriously used microtransactions against its consumers for the past few years. On the other hand, BioWare, the makers of the acclaimed “Dragon Age” and “Mass Effect” series, develops it. The game is definitely a departure from BioWare’s mature narrative games and much more akin to something like “Destiny,” a shared-world fantasy multiplayer game. Regardless of fan speculation, the game is undeniably ambitious in its scope. If it lands the mark, “Anthem” may be the biggest hit of 2019. 
“Devil May Cry 5”
Release Date: March 8
Another long-awaited sequel that will be released this spring is the latest installment of the “Devil May Cry” series. After the disappointing results of the 2013 series reboot, Capcom is bringing back the original version of its iconic series with Hideaki Itsuno back at the helm. With so many open worlds and multiplayer opportunities dominating the landscape, it is refreshing to see the combat-first genre come back in a big way. This fifth installment has Dante and Nero as playable characters, but also adds a mysterious new one to the mix, “V.” As with the other games in the series, the new installment will have characters explore their world while defeating demons and devils.
“Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice”
Release Date: March 22
FromSoftware, the developer behind “Sekiro,” has slowly become one of the most praised game developers in recent years. Games like “Dark Souls III” and “Bloodborne,” account for some of the most beautiful and challenging worlds in the modern era of gaming. With “Sekiro,” the developer is branching out through a new property. Players take control of a shinobi warrior left for dead by a samurai who sets out for revenge. While the story and world definitely seem enticing, it’s important to note that this is a departure from the developer’s classic RPG mechanics, such as character creation. Instead, the game focuses a single-player narrative, without giving up the developer’s trademark grueling difficulty. 
“Days Gone”
Release Date: April 26
There was a time when “Days Gone” was possibly the single most anticipated game of 2019, but those days are definitely gone — pun intended. Developed by SIE Bend Studio, this PlayStation 4 exclusive is the latest zombie game or, as the developers like to call them, “freakers.” Set in the Pacific Northwest, the player takes control of Deacon St. John, a lone-wolf biker in a post-apocalyptic open world. When Sony announced this game at E3 in 2016, the buzz was instant. However, the game has seen a lot of hype die down since the developer hasn’t shown much impressive gameplay yet. Nevertheless, “Days Gone” may just live up to its early announcement and blow everyone away. Fingers crossed.

James Blake is a name you may or may not be familiar with. His voice, however, is one you’ve most definitely heard. Blake has occupied the speakers in your car, the playlists at fraternity parties you “ironically” attend and the Instagram Stories your friends post. He is one of the most prolific guest vocalists in modern hip-hop, lending his chilly emotion to the projects of musical juggernauts such as Kanye West, Travis Scott and Beyoncé, among many others. 
Blake’s solo projects, while not distant departures from his guest work, have always been more experimental in nature. One of the singer’s most profound moments is the cut “The Wilhelm Scream” from his self-titled project in 2011. The song, a cover of Blake’s own father’s “Where to Turn,” is introspective electronica at its finest, juxtaposing raw emotion with a manufactured universe. The track epitomizes the brooding world of synthesized anguish which Blake has successfully inhabited throughout his career.
Enter the Jan. 18 release “Assume Form,” Blake’s latest full-length project.
The project is largely a departure from his previous work. Separate from content, it displays a similarly structured focus to that of the singer-songwriter’s previous works. The main difference at play on the record is a newfound, love-induced happiness and zest for life not featured on many of Blake’s past efforts. What results is a massively ambitious yet softly executed collection of songs about love, self-analysis and growth.
The title track and album opener sets the mood of the project well. It shows Blake attempting to leave the confining space of self-conscious thought and join the external environment around him. 
“I will assume form,” he sings. “I’ll be out of my head this time.” 
 The sentiment is a perfect way to welcome listeners into the world of the record. No longer a passerby, Blake will inject himself into the world around him.
He does this incredibly well, as exhibited by the several collaborations on the album. The first track naturally segues into the Metro Boomin-produced “Mile High.” The track, a playful nod to the ‘mile high club,’ features current hip-hop king Travis Scott on a relaxed yet focused verse. Blake matches Scott’s style here but maintains his individuality. Similar are the standouts “Barefoot In The Park” and “Where’s the Catch,” bolstered by immaculate assists from Rosalía and André 3000, respectively. The songs deal with two opposing topics: The time in a relationship where it starts to become significant and the moment you think it’s too good to be true.
Separate from the collaborative spirit of “Assume Form” is the central love story. The bulk of the tracklist deals with a relationship that has lifted Blake to heights before unknown. While not every track is a standout, each offers unique insight into the multifaceted nature of a growing romance. “Can’t Believe The Way We Flow” somewhat provides the feel of a Kanye West B-side yet is joyful in its sentiment, as is “Are You In Love?”, a second guess at the reality of a substantial relationship. “Power On” is perhaps the most significant of these love-soaked tracks, highlighting a complete shift in Blake’s attitude at the blossoming of his love affair. 
The album closes softly with “Lullaby For My Insomniac,” providing a perfect bookend to a concise yet expansive album. Here, Blake assumes the form he promised at the start, cooing his love to sleep and providing support should she lay awake with insomnia. 
As a whole, the album is a razor-focused collection of the most accessible works of Blake’s career. The British singer was able to use the trap influence of modern music without falling into its, well, traps. Rather, Blake amalgamates his signature experimental style with popular contemporary sounds and styles. He finds balance in emotional indulgence and upbeat world-building.
“Assume Form” is the first bop of the year.
Kieran Sweeney is a senior writing about new music. His column, “Bop or Flop,” runs every other Friday.

Students will be able to change their names and pronouns on their MyUSC accounts beginning Monday. The University directory, class rosters and Blackboard will reflect any name changes made. 
The change comes after two years of research and discussion spearheaded by the Graduate Student Government and the Office of the Provost. Eventually, all University records will reflect students’ preferred names and pronouns, except for matters that absolutely require a student’s legal name, such as financial aid and medical records.  
Chief Information Officer Doug Shook said the changes will be implemented on a rolling basis, since not all of the University systems are centralized. 
“There literally are hundreds of different systems where we could implement this,” Shook said. “It’s going to be phased in over time throughout the rest of the year.”
It was already possible for transgender and gender non-conforming students to request a name change for University email addresses, Net IDs and USCards through the Title IX Office and the LGBT Resource Center. Shook said the new policy changes will make this process easier for students.
“Technology … is being an enabler here rather than being an obstacle for us to help better serve the students and the faculty,” Shook said. 
Students were also able to send letters to their professors through the Title IX Office to request they use a preferred name and pronouns, but those changes previously wouldn’t apply to Blackboard.
GSG Vice President of Advocacy Emmett Harsin Drager uses they/them pronouns. They wrote a resolution last spring for USC to change its preferred name policy. Harsin Drager said their decision was partly inspired by their experience using Blackboard as a teaching assistant.
“As a trans person … I cared about changing the policy,” Harsin Drager said. “But I also recognized that there were more students on campus who wanted to be able to use preferred names that were international students, more than there are transgender students.”
Harsin Drager’s resolution listed other universities in the Pac-12 athletic conference that allow preferred names on their digital learning platforms. Out of the 12 schools, USC and Arizona State were the only ones that did not allow students to list their preferred names on Blackboard or other similar platforms. 
The policy change was also driven by the Obama administration’s 2016 “Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students,” which said that schools are required to respect students’ gender identities and preferred names, or they would run the risk of violating Title IX policies.
“The letter that was issued in 2016 started a lot of conversations within Title IX about the protections for trans students,” said Kegan Allee-Mowad, assistant director of USC’s Title IX Office. “Specifically, it raised questions about student records … and recognizing [students’] chosen names … as well as pronouns.” 
Allee-Mowad said Provost Michael Quick asked Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni to assemble a task force that would address the letter’s requirements in Fall 2016. The state of California lists gender as a protected class, which Allee-Mowad said informed the task force’s work.
Allee-Mowad said the task force included herself, Soni, LGBT Resource Center director Kelby Harrison and a number of students, who spent the year writing proposals that were then submitted to the Provost. 
After Quick gave his approval, the proposals moved on to Shook, who was responsible for the technological logistics, according to Allee-Mowad and Harrison. 
“The task force submitted its recommendations … We were doing pretty good on most other items; the IT piece really needed work,” Harrison said. 
By Fall 2017, after the task force’s proposals had been approved, the University was already working on implementing the policy changes. It was around this time that Harsin Drager, whose name in the University directory does not currently reflect their preferred name, approached Harrison for help. Harrison directed them to the Title IX Office, where they were able to get a new ID card and change the name associated with their student email.
“I just had to go down all these different avenues,” Harsin Drager said. “There were ways to change your name, but the one that remained impossible to change was Blackboard.”
Harsin Drager said Harrison encouraged them to draft the proposal for a GSG resolution, which would provide student pressure for USC to begin implementing the policy changes. They said that after the resolution passed last April, IT Services began coding the changes, including on Blackboard, which was not originally part of the Provost’s task force proposals. 
Harsin Drager said they hope the policy changes will help make USC a more inclusive community.
“In terms of the world, I feel like university campuses are more affirming than other spaces,” Harsin Drager said. “I’m excited that it’s finally happening … It should have happened a long time ago.”

Performers should be open to taking any role while understanding their perceived biases, ‘Westworld’ actor Jeffrey Wright told over 100 students and faculty in Wallis Annenberg Hall Thursday. 
Wright sat down with Taj Frazier, director of the Institute for Diversity and Empowerment at Annenberg, to discuss activism and the entertainment industry as part of the Annenberg-HBO Diverse Voices Series.
“I think I was bitten [by the bug of storytelling] multiple times and the infection was slow to take hold,” Wright said.
Annenberg Dean Willow Bay said the goal of the speaker series was to introduce students to a variety of professionals who can speak on their diverse experiences in the entertainment industry. 
“Our priority [is] in leading conversations that engage students, faculty and the larger community around some of the most pressing issues of our time,” Bay said. 
Wright started the conversation by telling the audience that his grandfather, a waterman in Virginia, inspired him to become a storyteller. People from around the neighborhood would gather at his grandfather’s home bar after work and share stories.  
“My grandfather was a farmer and a whisky teller … a country renaissance man,” Wright said. “As a child going down in the summer, I was surrounded by these characters.”
Wright said he was inspired by the diversity of characters who visited his grandfather’s house when he was younger.  
“There were black folks, white folks, native folks,” Wright said. “For me, it was an exercise in character study and an exercise in performing. My [grandfather] was a performer.” 
While growing up in Washington, D.C. in the 1960s and 1970s, politics were intertwined in every aspect of his life, Wright said. 
“When you’re born in D.C., the doctor takes you out of the womb, slaps you on your ass and asks you what your political affiliation is,” Wright said.
During his early college years, Wright focused more on political activism than performance and was active in the anti-apartheid movement. Wright recalled going to the school library to read about former South African President Nelson Mandela’s imprisonment as well as participating in campus sit-ins to protest the South African government. 
“It’s one thing to put on a show, but it’s another thing to effect change,” he said.
Wright discovered his interest in performance in his junior year of college. Since then, he has appeared in nine HBO productions, including “Westworld,” “Angels in America” and “Boardwalk Empire.”
Wright also won a Tony Award in 1994 for his role as Norman “Belize” Arriaga in the Broadway show “Angels in America,” which later became an HBO miniseries. He said the role was a breakthrough for his career as a storyteller and that the show had a strong impact on members of the audience who were afflicted by the AIDS epidemic. 
“‘Angels in America’ was a crossroads of politics, storytelling and theater,” Wright said. “I hope you find those moments where you realize you are exactly where you need to be.”
Wright’s recent work focuses on using art as a means of activism. He produced a 2018 HBO documentary titled “We Are Not Done Yet,” which focuses on the lives of veterans and active duty service men. Wright also stars in the 2018 film “O.G.,” which tells the story of a man at the end of his 24-year prison sentence. 
Toward the end of the event, Wright responded to student questions about his creative process and how he gets into character. Wright said that for characters like Belize, he addressed his own experiences and perspectives as an individual.
“I had to be aware of my sexuality and my biases when doing ‘Angels in America,’” Wright said. “More than Belize’s sexuality was his compassion, intellect, sense of community.”
Wright told students to work hard for their achievements and encouraged them to pursue their passion. 
“You have to be convicted and impassioned about what you do,” he said. “If you have a vision and the pragmatic means of shaping that vision, do it. Don’t let anyone tell you not to. Don’t listen to anyone, including me.”

After receiving a $1.69 million grant from the National Institute of Health, associate professor Denis Evseenko will work to find a potential cure for diseases like arthritis.
Evseenko’s research will focus on the regenerative capacities of joint cartilage cells, which affect such diseases. The grant will disperse in February and last five years.
“Stem cells can make cartilage when they’re young, but when you become an adult, you can no longer make any cartilage,” said Ruchi Bajpai, an associate professor on Evseenko’s team. “They can’t repair anymore, so the question is: Do we not have the stem cells or do we not have the mechanism to activate them?”  
The research team will be looking at the STAT3 gene, which is beneficial in fetal cartilage but can lead to inflammation and arthritis among adults.
Arthritis affects about 54 million adults and 300,000 infants in America, according to the Arthritis Foundation. Arthritis is already the leading cause of disability in adults, and the number of people affected in the U.S. is expected to rise to 78 million by 2040.
“Very often patients who have arthritis get these cartilage defects that they have to live with for the rest of their life,” Bajpai said. “It’s so hard because there’s no way to repair or heal or work with them.”
The project will find ways to delay or minimize the effects of arthritis by manipulating stem cells and reversing or delaying aging in the synovial joint, the most common joint in the human body, according to Evseenko.  
Levels of STAT3 decrease as cells lose their ability to regenerate, leading the research team to believe there is a correlation between aging and regeneration, Evseenko said. 
From there, the team plans to manipulate the mechanisms that involve STAT3 to create a more efficient cure for those suffering from arthritis. Currently, patients can undergo therapies like hydrotherapy or acupuncture,  take medicines or receive joint, hip or knee replacement surgeries. However, there is no cure for most types of arthritis, only treatment.
“[We want to] find out what are the molecular mechanisms that trigger these stem cells from working,” Bajpai said. “Once we figure this out, we can potentially apply them in various contexts where you want to regenerate cartilage in people.” 
The team will also conduct research regarding adults who have high levels of STAT3 but do not suffer from arthritis. Once they solve the mystery behind the differing effects, the team will attempt to heal the damage at the root source rather than prescribing pain medication or suggesting joint surgery. 
“We want to figure out what makes those cells special,” postdoctoral fellow Ben Van Handel said. “Why are they able to maintain STAT3 levels that are high and not suffer the bad consequences that typically happen when they activate STAT3?” 
The team hopes to use this research to develop an inflammation-reducing drug that would kickstart the regenerative state of the joint cartilage, Van Handel said. 
Evseenko has received close to $4 million for his stem cell research over the past few years, which has resulted in several breakthroughs in regenerative and anti-inflammatory medicine, along with the formation of human joint cartilage.

Gloria Allred has always been a rebel. The award-winning lawyer is best known for her contributions to modern-day reproductive rights, but Allred is not done fighting. 
The feminist lawyer, who represents several alleged victims of former USC gynecologist George Tyndall, spoke at an event hosted by the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment  to commemorate the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade, which upholds a woman’s private right to abortion. 
The conversation, which was moderated by political science professor Alison Rentln, covered reproductive rights, sexual harassment in the workplace, current #MeToo era court cases and needed progress.
“The attacks on Roe v. Wade have not ceased,” Allred said. “We live in very dangerous times, to put it mildly.”  
Before the 1973 court decision, abortion was criminalized and obtaining affordable, safe and legal abortions was not possible. This led many women to seek dangerous and often life-threatening backdoor abortions — just as Allred did after she was raped while on vacation in Mexico in her 20s. Allred said when she returned to California, she did not report the crime and sought an illegal and unsafe abortion.
“I did what millions of women did in those days,” Allred said. “I had the [illegal] abortion and was left to hemorrhage in a bathtub.” 
Allred’s own traumatic experience and the lack of support she received inspired her to pursue a career in justice.
“[Restricting access to abortion] is about controlling women so that you don’t have a choice,” Allred said. “Whether [a woman] gets pregnant when she’s a teenager and takes that pregnancy to term, could be the most important economic decision for the rest of her life.” 
Even though Roe v. Wade legalized abortion, states can still regulate and restrict women’s access to treatment. Some states, like West Virginia, only have one women’s health clinic.
According to Allred, young women, poor women and women of color are especially vulnerable when safe abortions provided by licensed health care providers and clinics are limited.
While progress has been made, there is still more to be done in order to achieve gender parity, Allred said.
“I don’t look at where we used to be and where we are now,” Allred  said. “I look to where we should be, which is enjoying equal rights under the law.” 
Allred said that the lack of an Equal Rights Amendment, which was proposed 96 years ago, demonstrates how change still needs to be made. The workplace, in particular, is a breeding ground for sexual misconduct and oppression of women, Allred said. 
“There is still so much sexual harassment in the workplace,” Allred said. “It’s about a power dynamic. It’s mostly men in power and they take advantage of those who are not in power and that’s women, who are lower in the workforce.” 
As a civil rights litigation attorney, Allred worked on numerous cases involving high-profile men accused of sexual predatory behavior. She represented women who spoke out against film producer Harvey Weinstein and comedian Bill Cosby, filing both criminal and civil cases. At USC, Allred has represented several alleged victims of Tyndall, who is currently under investigation for sexually abusing hundreds of patients over his nearly 30 years as a campus gynecologist.
“These women are very brave,” Allred said. “The cost of the wrong should not be borne by the victim but by the wrongdoer.” 
Allred encouraged the women to fight for their rights and men to act as allies and support a vision of equality. Allred said that when she feels unmotivated by the lack of progress in gender equality, she always considers the negative effects of inaction.
“Take that anger and rage, turn it outward into some constructive action to help other people,” Allred said. “Do what Mother Jones said, ‘don’t agonize, organize.’” 
Allred called the women in the audience leaders and said that by participating in the discussion, they were getting involved in the movement.
“This is the age of empowerment of women,” Allred said. “We are not going to be silenced anymore. We are not going to live in fear.”
