In my time spent watching the United States play soccer, the team has fallen flat plenty. I’m used to watching an otherwise promising nation flop on the biggest stages. This instilled sense of pessimism is ingrained into my mind, and it creates a massive cognitive dissonance when things actually go the U.S.’ way. 
There’s no other way to describe the feeling of watching your nation finally overcome its history of failure with a massive third win over its rivals in 2021. Simply put, USMNT shocked me on Friday. 
I didn’t expect manager Gregg Berhalter to pick one of his best starting 11’s yet. I didn’t expect the players to come out of the gates aggressively pressing the Mexico backline. I didn’t expect the U.S. to catch a break or two as Mexico let some chances go unfinished. 
But the one thing I can truly say I was counting on came in the 69th minute. Star winger Christian Pulisic ran onto the pitch for the USMNT for the first time since his injury in the first qualifying window. As a Chelsea fan as well as a U.S. fan, Pulisic is by far my favorite player, and I had a feeling he wasn’t going to stay quiet. 
Who else could it have been but the super-substitute Pulisic to break the deadlock? The national team star returned from injury and wasted no time making an impact. He came flying in out of nowhere to meet a cross in the box, thumping a header home in the 74th minute to give the U.S. the lead and sending the stadium in Cincinnati into a frenzy. The goal also sent me into a frenzy, as I ran around my apartment yelling louder than I should’ve. 
Another goal from midfielder Weston McKennie sealed the deal, and the U.S. claimed a third victory over Mexico in 2021. 
Of course, the initial reaction after the game was to ask: What went right? The match felt like the perfect storm, but, for me, it really boiled down to two things. 
First, the USMNT had a visible tactical game plan, something that we haven’t always seen in Berhalter’s time in charge. I can’t count on my hands the number of times I’ve watched the U.S. play a full 90 minutes without any indication of what might’ve been the game plan. I’m so used to the unpredictable free-for-all World Cup Qualifying games where the attack has little cohesion and the defense remains sloppy. All of this being said, I have to credit Berhalter for finally coming out with aspirations. 
The U.S. demonstrated a clear strategy from the first whistle: They put on an aggressive press that forced the ball back to Mexico’s keeper and forced El Tri to make quick clearances that oftentimes resulted in a loss of possession. From there, the U.S. was picking the ball up in advanced areas with numerous players ready to make runs. It just made sense. Berhalter placed trust in his back line to snuff out counter-attacking chances, a risk that paid off. 
The second key to the game was execution in key moments. I know, I’m sounding like every football coach ever when I say that, but I promise I have more unique insight to offer. In games where the team might not get more than two or three good looks on goal, having the composure to take those chances is the difference between a win and a draw or loss. If goalkeeper Zack Steffen didn’t make a top-class save on winger Hirving Lozano’s low strike, the U.S. would’ve fallen behind early and likely wouldn’t have gone on to win the game. The same thing goes for Pulisic’s goal: Had the chance been missed, I don’t think Mexico would have conceded its second goal (a sloppy defensive error that really showed they were done trying). 
Berhalter can only do so much to set the team up for success. It’s these moments of execution — much like Pulisic’s penalty in the Nations League Final, or defender Miles Robinson’s extra-time header to win the Gold Cup Final — that separate average teams from lethal teams. It brings me the utmost joy to report that, as of now, the USMNT falls into the lethal category. 
But slow your roll on the party train because it wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows this window. In classic USMNT fashion, the team played down to its opponent’s level in a 1-1 draw away against Jamaica. 
USMNT fans were a little bit too high on the Mexico win in their assessment of the Jamaica game. I saw fans across social media brushing off another lackluster performance in which the U.S. very well could’ve lost (Jamaica had a goal disallowed unfairly toward the end of the game). 
My main issue is that, however great the U.S. was tactically in the Mexico game, the team can’t seem to figure out how to break down teams who park the bus — in other words, put every man behind the ball and defend for their lives. This especially matters in CONCACAF play because some of the lower-level teams will do whatever they can to prevent defeat. The U.S. hasn’t cracked the code on scoring when its opponents park the bus, and one goal from the opposing team, no matter how scrappy, can prevent the U.S. from getting a full 3 points. 
After Canada’s dramatic win Tuesday over Mexico, the U.S. sits in second place in the Octagon with 15 points after eight games played. It looks as though Panama, Mexico, the U.S. and Canada will claim the top four spots, although a lot can change in the last six matches. 
With some key away fixtures coming up, the USMNT has a chance to bolster its qualifying chances. For now, the team can rest easy knowing that 2021 was its year. For the first time in forever, the hope that I have for this team is unchecked, unlimited and no longer restricted by the disappointment of the past.

The Center for International and Public Affairs will be renamed the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International and Public Affairs, President Carol Folt announced in a communitywide email Thursday. 
Medicine Crow, who graduated from USC in 1939 with a graduate degree in anthropology and received an honorary doctoral degree in 2003, was the first member of the Apsáalooke (Crow) tribe to earn a master’s degree. He was named the tribe’s last war chief following his service in the U.S. Army’s 103rd Infantry Division in World War II, and worked as a tribal historian for the Apsáalooke (Crow) Nation for over 50 years. In 2009, former President Barack Obama honored Medicine Crow with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian medal of honor, for his military service and contributions to Native American history. 
“Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow was an ambassador and bridge builder who used education to create intercultural understanding and promote collaboration between peoples and communities,” Folt wrote in the email. 
A scholarship allowed Medicine Crow to pursue his graduate studies at USC, which is why Folt will implement a scholarship program in his namesake. The program, which she aims to launch in the spring, will provide up to five scholarships to Native American students. 
“I want to work a bit with our Native community too, to see what kind of scholarships would be most beneficial, … where we can have the biggest impact,” said Folt in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We want to tailor it to be very effective and something that will really attract people to USC that might not think about it.” 
Medicine Crow was chosen as the new namesake by the Center for International and Public Affairs Naming Committee, composed of students, staff, faculty and alumni. Folt said that the committee looked at over 200 names, but felt Medicine Crow “hit every single dream that they had for the building.” 
The University received Medicine Crow’s family’s blessing to rename the building in his honor, which Folt said was “really important.” 
“We want to do all the work that we can, and we wanted to really do it in a way that was respectful and meaningful,” Folt said. 
Formerly named the Von KleinSmid Center, the building previously honored former University President and known eugenicist Rufus von KleinSmid, which had been protested by students for years. Hours before Folt’s inauguration in September 2019, a bust of von KleinSmid was found vandalized at the building with a piece of cloth with red lettering reading “RENAME VKC” and a cardboard sign with the words “NAZI” covering the statue. 
The building was temporarily renamed the Center for International and Public Affairs by the Board of Trustees in June 2020, following months of petitions and outcry for the University to act against systemic racism and anti-Blackness. 
Folt said she moved to remove Von KleinSmid’s name from the building “a couple months” after she arrived at USC in June 2019, and worked with the Board of Trustees to create the renaming committee. However, she said the announcement was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
“I think we weren’t feeling the rush to rename it during the time that we were dealing with COVID, but we had the committee,” Folt said. “The committee was doing its work, it had their candidate and then, we came out of COVID, and we’re able to say, ‘OK, now let’s bring this forward and announce it to the community.” 
Despite Von KleinSmid’s name’s removal from the building, Folt said there would be other ways to understand his legacy as a former president of the University. 
“I think there’ll be many opportunities to understand more fully the history of VKC, but in renaming it and removing that name, … we’re able to really put in place a person who is such an exemplar of our mission, a person that just is a deeply principled person, representative in so many different areas for our students,” Folt said. “I think we’re really making a pretty strong statement about who we really want to see honored on the building.” 
University leaders are planning a dedication ceremony for the building in Spring 2022.

Following months of councilmember debates and multiple drafts regarding redistricting, the Los Angeles City Council Redistricting Commission held that USC and Exposition Park will remain in City Council District 9, according to a draft of the redistricting map finalized Nov. 9. 
The decision, which follows debates between Councilmembers Marqueece Harris-Dawson and Curren Price over whether USC should reside in District 8 or 9, must be completed by Dec. 15. 
The redistricting process faced scrutiny 10 years ago following then-Council President Herb Wesson’s removal of USC and other institutions from District 8, allegedly to punish past councilmembers of Districts 8 and 9 for being at odds with him.
The Council moved USC and Exposition Park from  District 8 to  District 9 in 2012 and will remain in Price’s District 9 as part of the recently finalized draft. 
Harris-Dawson proposed to move USC and Exposition Park back into District 8 last Tuesday because of the area’s large population of Black constituents, according to the Los Angeles Times. Moving the University’s wealth and resources into the District 8, Harris-Dawson said, would provide needed resources for the community he represents. 
However, Price argued that the University’s resources would better serve his district, which comprises a majority of Latinx residents and includes the highest concentration of poverty in L.A. 
Gloria Molina, a Fall 2021 Fellow at the Center for the Political Future and the first Latina member on the L.A. County Board of Supervisors, said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that she believes USC and Exposition Park should remain in District 9. Molina said she was surprised by arguments that suggested USC should move to District 8 because it would be an important asset for the Black community, as District 9 is a “very highly” Latinx district. 
“The argument is kind of petty and ridiculous,” Molina said. “Instead of talking about the richness of constituents that they represent and the opportunities they have to better serve those constituents, [councilmembers] are talking about these assets, or these resources, which is not the most significant part of the role and responsibility.”
Only three of the 14 councilmembers, including Harris-Dawson, voted in favor of the proposal to move USC into his district.
Sam Garrison, senior vice president of University Relations, said redistricting allows different neighborhoods with distinct identities to be fairly represented in politics. In 2008, Garrison helped lead a California statewide ballot called Proposition 11 to establish an independent redistricting commission to ensure fair representation across the state.
“The fabric of the neighborhood includes how it is represented in local government, and that is essential to the current process [of redistricting] on making sure that the city’s redistricting is completed fairly,” Garrison said.
Garrison said he agrees that USC and Exposition Park are beneficial to their district because of their cultural, educational and economic power. 
“Expo Park is an incredible cultural and community resource with the parks, the museums, certainly with the Coliseum and with Banc of California stadium,” he said. “They’re city and regional assets that accrue back to the entire region.”
Garrison said USC does not have a preference on its district placement as long as the University remains in the same district as Exposition Park because of how tight knit the USC community is to it. 
“We did not take any position on what district the University Park Campus and Expo Park should be,” Garrison said. “Our focus has been keeping us intact as we have been for decades.” 
Mindy Romero, director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, said “very flagrant attempts” were previously made to misuse the redistricting process in California. 
“It’s a careful attempt at gerrymandering districts in order to benefit one party or another,” Romero said. “We’ve seen the effect of that on real outcomes in communities, and this 10-year process. I think it’s more important than ever.”
Romero also said she believes that splitting communities through district lines requires serious consideration beforehand as the goal of redistricting is to “keep communities whole.”
“In local, state and national redistricting conversations, it’s always a flag if a known community is split,” Romero said. “[The redistricting] at least deserves additional attention and debate in terms of whether that’s appropriate.”
In a statement to the L.A. City Council Redistricting Commission, Garrison said that USC and Exposition Park have been in the same district together for decades and identify closely with each other. 
“This is consistent with decades of previous redistricting efforts that recognized the close relationship between USC and Expo Park that dates back [to] the late 1800s,” Garrison’s statement reads. “USC has long viewed our campus and Expo Park as extensions of each other … We are part of the same community and have longstanding, recognized boundaries and street lines.” 
Ordinance consideration will be made in a council meeting on Dec. 1 after one more state-required hearing.

The Resident Assistant Organizing Committee launched a petition Wednesday asking for increased compensation following an audit that negatively impacted RAs financial aid packages. At the time of publication, the petition had accumulated 287 signatures.
According to the petition and RAs that spoke to the Daily Trojan, when RAs received their financial aid packages a week or two before they started work in August, many noticed the amount was significantly less than aid they received in the past.
Makayla Howard, a junior majoring in fine arts and an RA at Pardee Tower, said that because the free housing and dining RAs receive lowers the cost of attendance, many received less financial aid than they would have without the position. Since RAs received less financial aid, many lost money as a result of their positions despite working long hours. 
Now, RAs are urging the University for a $10,730 semesterly stipend that would not be deducted from financial aid — equivalent to the cost of housing and dining at McCarthy Honors College, the most expensive residential college. 
Howard helped organize the petition and wrote an Oct. 25 collective action letter to Residential Education Senior Director Grant Burlew. When she received her financial aid package a few weeks before the start of the semester, Howard noticed a “$6,000 difference in grant aid.” Many other RAs lost work study funds and thousands of dollars, Howard said. 
According to the petition, the financial aid decrease caused many RAs to “accrue late fees” while balancing work responsibilities and paying tuition. In the petition, the RA Organizing Committee called for the immediate removal of RA’s collection holds. 
Howard said she was unable to pay her bill until the very last minute, when she received her coronavirus grant, because she and her parents had expected the cost of housing and dining to be taken care of. 
Felanté Charlemagne, a senior majoring in sociology and an RA at Webb Tower, said they’re in a similar position — their cost of attendance increased by $6,000 this year and they are unsure of how to pay that off. Due to Charlemagne’s overdue fees, the University placed a hold on their account that restricts them from registering for classes.
“I don’t know where I’m going to conjure that [money] from,” Charlemagne said. “I haven’t registered for classes and my date was like two weeks ago because it’s locked.”
As an RA, Howard said she works long hours, including a 40-hour week at the beginning of the semester and 24-hour emergency response shifts. Howard also said the financial aid changes erased the work she does. Since housing and dining are not free, her labor pays for it.
“It was just really ridiculous to be doing all this work for the RAs and then also lose money at the same time,” Howard said. 
Howard said that the University justifies the limited compensation by referring to RAs as student leaders rather than student workers.
According to Howard, the relationship between ResEd and RAs is “really exploitative,” as the RAs work several undocumented hours and don’t have a mechanism to air their grievances. While the RAs look to continue organizing, Howard also said RAs don’t have a union or voice to speak to when “things go wrong.”
“USC takes advantage of the fact that we’re young kids who need housing in L.A. and have no other option,” Howard said. “Also, they’re taking advantage of the fact that we have no system of advocating for our workers’ rights.”
In the petition, the RA Organizing Committee demanded the establishment of an RA advisory board that would attend “higher-up meetings” to “have a voice on the decisions impacting our livelihood.”
In the letter addressed to Burlew, a group of RAs expressed discontent with the changes that reduced their need-based aid in proportion to housing and dining expenses. 
“When added, the removal of housing and dining from RAs’ estimated cost of attendance and the increase in actual cost of attendance, has created a preposterous situation: RAs with need-based financial aid packages are paying to be RAs,” the letter read.
In an email obtained by the Daily Trojan, Burlew issued a response to Howard on Nov. 11, writing that federal regulations and USC policy require that “all students’ resources … be taken into consideration when calculating a student’s eligibility for need-based financial aid.”
In the email, Burlew wrote that RAs with current holds or late fees are encouraged to contact financial aid to discuss their individual situation, and that ResEd will work with financial aid if the restriction is related to the student’s RA position. 
He also wrote that the RA advisory board, which has typically consisted of third and fourth year students, will be restarted in the spring semester after a pause this fall as ResEd was “still focusing on providing a safe move-in experience and start to the school year.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Student Affairs wrote that it “values all resident assistants” and that RA applicants are informed of their employment’s impact on financial aid.
“When students apply for the position (and on the website), they are told that the financial compensation for the RA position is in the form of covering the financial aid costs of USC Housing and a meal package,” the statement read. “Because each individual’s situation is unique, the financial aid package will affect each student’s overall aid package differently.”

Content warning: This article contains references to police violence and abuse.
Department of Public Safety officers are accused of using excessive force against a community member and the University “failed to impose adequate discipline” against the department, according to a lawsuit filed against USC in October. 
According to court documents, there are two causes of action including intentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of the right of protection from bodily restraint or harm. The plaintiff also filed seven claims for relief, including false arrest/false imprisonment, unreasonable search and seizure — detention and arrest, assault and battery and negligence. 
On Oct. 11, 2019 at approximately 2:35 a.m, the plaintiff, Liliana Cortez, walked onto the Alpha Chi Omega property and hugged a tree before DPS officers stopped her and asked if she was homeless, to which she said she was not, according to Cortez’s complaint. 
While the officers accused Cortez of refusing to leave the property according to the complaint, the documents contend that Cortez had “no intention to stay” and that one of the officers “suddenly, unjustifiably, and unreasonably assaulted and forcefully grabbed and pulled Plaintiff and proceeded to unjustly detain her” after Cortez said she was leaving.
Cortez remained calm and asked the officer to stop after their initial action, but multiple officers “piled on top of [Cortez]” as she pleaded for help, according to Cortez’s complaint. 
After piling on top of her, officers allegedly pressed Cortez’s face into the asphalt, bent her fingers back and “[yanked] her arms nearly out of their sockets” while handcuffing her, leading Cortez to “fear for her life,” the complaint reads.
“The DOE officers ignored Plaintiff’s pleas and continued repeatedly pushing and slamming Plaintiff’s head into the ground, causing serious and severe injuries to her body and face,” according to Cortez’s filing. 
After handcuffing her, officers arrested Cortez and her friend and called them “losers” as they put her in the vehicle, according to the complaint, and she spent the night in jail.
In a defense filing to Cortez’s complaint Nov. 8, the University wrote that Cortez was “lawfully detained” by officers and denied all other allegations.
DPS Crime logs from Oct. 11, 2019 list that a male and female were arrested from 2:17 a.m. to 3:36 a.m. for trespassing at the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University wrote that it takes reports of misconduct seriously and “[looks] forward to defending this matter and sharing the facts of what actually occurred in court.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Cortez’s lawyer James DeSimone said that he hopes Cortez will receive compensation and that the University will take actions to punish the officers involved. 
“This is a situation where it appears that the USC security officers just engaged in completely unnecessary excessive force against her when she was engaged in just innocent conduct that night, enjoying an evening,” DeSimone said.
According to the Cortez’s complaint, she seeks damages for emotional distress, physical injury, fright, medical expenses, loss of earnings and attorney fees and requested a jury trial.
DeSimone said the officer’s alleged behavior is part of a larger pattern of police misconduct and lack of discipline against officers.
“Unfortunately, because police agencies such as the [Los Angeles Police Department] really have not imposed proper discipline in many instances on officers when they engage in excessive force, it actually encourages and condones officers to engage in that conduct,” he said.
DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan that the department does not comment on issues with pending litigation. 
Attorneys for the University did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp resigned from his position for health-related reasons, Provost Charles Zukoski announced Wednesday in a communitywide email. 
Senior Associate Vice Provost for Student Affairs Monique Allard has been serving as acting vice president for student affairs since Oct. 7, when Crisp took a leave of absence for personal health issues. Crisp came into the position in 2019 and replaced then-interim Vice President Allard, who stepped into the position following Ainsley Carry’s departure to assume the role of Vice President for Students at the University of British Columbia. 
Crisp brought 26 years of previous experience in student affairs at the University of North Carolina — where President Carol Folt previously served — to USC, where he oversaw progress in diversity, equity and inclusion as well as mental health and well-being. 
Over his two-year tenure, Crisp expanded spaces for the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and the First Generation Plus Success Center and served as co-chair of the Provost’s Task Force on University Nomenclature, according to Zukoski’s email. The task force, created in 2019 by then-Provost Michael Quick, addressed concerns about building names, statues and monuments.
During his time at USC, Crisp helped carry out and communicate to the community about an overhaul of mental health resources on campus, including the hiring of 12 additional counselors at the University counseling center and the implementation of long-term services at the Engemann Student Health Center. 
Crisp also served as the liaison between students and administration, playing an active role in the advocacy of student interests, Zukoski wrote in the email.
“He was the voice of the student body while providing mentorship and leadership for many student organizations,” Zukoski wrote. “Mr. Crisp built relationships between housing, academic affairs, social groups, and parent groups.”
Over the pandemic, Crisp and his Student Affairs team created programs and digital communities to facilitate a remote college experience and led the return to campus in Fall 2021 with the largest Welcome Experience on record, according to the email. 
“He set up an emergency fund program,” Zukoski said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “He set up all sorts of student participation activities that had to be done remotely. And then he and his team worked unbelievably hard to create the environment that enabled us to get started in the fall. That was truly a heavy lift and quite remarkable, what they accomplished.”

This NFL season has been up and down for former USC players. Some have been standouts, others have continued past success and a handful have been derailed because of injuries. This season alone, Rams wide receiver Robert Woods tore his ACL, Panthers quarterback Sam Darnold hurt his shoulder and Steelers wide receiver Juju ​​Smith-Schuster dislocated his shoulder. Still, a few former Trojans stood out in Week 9 of the NFL season, helping their respective teams compete for a playoff position.
Safety Talanoa Hufanga 
In a surprising blowout win against potential Super Bowl contender Los Angeles Rams at home, Talanoa Hufanga racked up some important stops on the defensive end against a Rams team that has the second-most passing yards this season. Hufanga racked up 3 tackles and 1 pass defended. All 3 of his tackles were solo. This puts Hufanga’s season totals at 17 total tackles, 12 solo tackles and 1 pass deflected. 
Hufanga has jumped up to the NFL pace quickly, already playing a big role in San Francisco’s secondary. In the 49ers’ past three games, Hufanga played every defensive snap.
Wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown
The Lions picked up their first non-loss in a tie away against the Steelers after a chaotic overtime period. In this matchup, Amon-Ra St. Brown had 4 receptions on 6 targets to rack up a total of 61 yards for the day. He averaged 15.3 yards per reception and his longest catch went for 30 yards. His ability as a deep threat helped diversify a struggling Lions offense. St. Brown is now at 311 receiving yards on the season with 31 receptions, averaging around 10 yards per reception. St. Brown has not scored a touchdown.
Wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr.
In the Indianapolis Colts’ most recent win against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Pittman Jr. pulled in all 5 of his targets for a total of 71 yards. He averaged 14.2 yards per catch with the longest reception going for 27 yards. Pittman Jr. is continuing a breakout season for the Colts, and the Jaguars game marked the fifth time he has gone over 70 yards in a game this season. His 72.4% catching rate on the year puts him above notable receivers such as DeAndre Hopkins and Justin Jefferson.
Pittman Jr.’s totals on the season put him in good company. His 55 receptions and 5 touchdowns are tied for the 11th most and 12th most in the NFL, respectively. He ranks highest in total receiving yards with 729 -— the ninth most in the league this season. 
Left guard Alijah Vera-Tucker
As the No. 14 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, Alijah Vera-Tucker looks to help a struggling New York Jets offensive line. Despite the Jets suffering a blowout loss to the Buffalo Bills, Vera-Tucker continues to develop and has played every offensive snap this season. Even in the loss, the Jets offensive line allowed only 1 sack throughout the game. According to Pro Football Focus, Vera-Tucker has only allowed 1 sack on 613 snaps this season. That snap total puts him tied for 15th most snaps amongst guards.

It’s no secret that women are dominating the hip-hop industry, and if you want to feel like the baddest person in the building, check out this list to upgrade your Spotify playlists with some certified bops from these talented rappers.
Saweetie
USC alumna Saweetie has been at the helm of short-form video virality before the nascent social media giant known as TikTok came into existence. Her 2017 smash hit “ICY GIRL” was ahead of its time, chock full of clever lines that could easily be memed and circulated on the lip-syncing platform Musical.ly. Racking up millions of streams on Spotify and YouTube, her popularity has only skyrocketed since Musical.ly rebranded as TikTok.
Saweetie used her virality to launch a career that led her original songs and features to carve out seemingly permanent places among Billboard’s Top 100. More recently, she collaborated with trending artists such as Dua Lipa and DaBaby and hosted (and performed at) MTV’s European Music Awards earlier this week. 
Saweetie’s verses are guaranteed to get anyone on the dancefloor, so if you’re feeling down and need a confidence booster, look no further than her growing discography.
Popular Songs: “My Type,” “Tap In,” “ICY GIRL,” “Best Friend”
Doja Cat
After publishing a few singles to streaming platform SoundCloud, Doja Cat eventually found her success on an entirely different platform — YouTube. In August 2018, Doja Cat uploaded a low-budget music video to her offbeat and absurdist song “Mooo!” The music video currently sits at 97 million views, as the song skyrocketed to viral success fueled by a younger audience.
While other artists may have used their 15 minutes of internet fame to recreate their first hit, Doja Cat used her virality to establish herself as both a serious artist and an offbeat internet personality. Doja Cat effortlessly shifted from a niche internet meme into the mainstream without sacrificing her unique social media presence. Albums released by Doja Cat following her viral fame have accumulated billions of streams and led the artist to collaborate with certified A-listers such as Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.
After her single “Say So” was remixed with a verse from Nicki Minaj, the song claimed a number one spot atop the Billboard Hot 100 in May 2020. After nabbing a Billboard Music Award earlier this year, it is safe to say that Doja Cat is not going anywhere.
Popular Songs: “Say So,” “Kiss Me More,” “Need to Know”
Rico Nasty
Maryland-born Rico Nasty marries punk-inspired lyrics and rowdy verses into music that feels like you’ve just chugged a Monster energy drink. 
Starting her music career after graduating high school, Rico Nasty soon reached internet success with the release of her 2016 mixtape, “The Rico Story.” Eventually signing with Atlantic Records, Rico Nasty released multiple studio albums and mixtapes to critical acclaim. One of her more popular tracks, the tongue-in-cheek song “Smack a Bitch,” made rounds on TikTok, accumulating nearly 100 million streams on Spotify. Performing at Coachella for the first time in 2019, Rico Nasty’s career is only just beginning, and the unique combination of her ever-changing pop-punk appearance and brash lyrics have found a mainstream audience among TikTok users.
Falling within a genre which Rico herself dubs “Sugar Trap,” her tracks meld an extreme delivery with subdued beats. Rico Nasty’s tracks have also been featured on the hit HBO series “Insecure.” 
Popular Songs: “Rage,” “Smack a Bitch,” “OHFR?”
Megan Thee Stallion
Certified hot girls unite! After skyrocketing to success with her 2019 EP “Tina Snow,” Texas-born Megan Thee Stallion has cemented herself as one of the most popular names in music. 
With catchy verses celebrating the joys of being a “hot girl,” it seems as if one of her lyrics becomes a viral TikTok trend every few weeks. Known for her creative freestyle and internet presence, Megan Thee Stallion’s new tracks and features are almost guaranteed a spot atop the Billboard Hot 100. Within a relatively short career, she has accumulated hundreds of millions of streams on Spotify and YouTube, and brought home three Grammy Awards in 2021, including Best New Artist. 
Popular Songs: “WAP,” “Savage,” “Body”

What’s better than the holiday season? Starbucks season. The seasonal menu returned Nov. 4, and, if you haven’t been getting Starbucks every day since, what have you been waiting for? 
There is quite simply nothing better than a steaming Peppermint Hot Chocolate or Toasted White Chocolate Mocha to get a taste of the holidays as you spend your remaining sanity finishing the semester strong. Consider this ranking of the Starbucks seasonal menu as your official sign from the stars to get your holiday on. 
8) Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew
As a disclaimer: I am simply not a pumpkin girlie. While I work on this listicle, sipping on the very drink that I am talking about, I fail to understand the sway pumpkin has as a flavor and yet, this list wouldn’t be complete without mentioning it. 
Do yourself a favor and move away from the very basic persona of a pumpkin spice latte. You can and must do better! The Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew has everything you’re looking for in a coffee, with the added bonus of a sweet pumpkin foam to remind you that it’s fall. The foam’s sweetness and creaminess are a perfect supplement to the strong, bitter taste of the cold brew. This is the drink to get as you stroll 20 minutes late to your 9 a.m. and ruminate on the lack of fall foliage in Los Angeles. 
7) Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffin 
To get our pumpkin mentions out of the way, here is another suggestion for all you pumpkin-is-the-perfect-fall-flavor obsessed people reading this listicle. Starbucks bakery items can be a hit or a miss and aren’t known for being the freshest or best bakery products, but sometimes we have to settle for less. 
The Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffin doesn’t feel like settling for less. The cream cheese was simply the star of the show for me. If food can transport you somewhere else, the muffin made me feel like I was on the East Coast in a red beanie with a scarf around my neck and surrounded by maple trees. As an added suggestion, stream “Red (Taylor’s Version)” as you bite into the muffin for all the fall feels you need.    
6) Sugar Plum Cheese Danish
I was initially hesitant about whether I would like the Sugar Plum Cheese Danish. The cheese danish does its job when I need a quick breakfast sugar fix, and I wasn’t convinced about sugar plum adding anything of substance. I was pleasantly surprised at how the jam elevated the danish, giving it a holiday twist. 
The jam and cheese together create an explosion of holiday flavors in your mouth. I will always wish for more cheese, but the jam was more than generous. If you’re willing to give the Starbucks bakery items a chance, the Sugar Plum Cheese Danish could be the one. 
5) Toasted White Chocolate Mocha
Who needs someone to cuddle with this cuffing season when that’s what drinking the Toasted White Chocolate Mocha feels like? Even better if you have someone to cuddle with while sipping on the drink. No pressure. This is not a drink for serious coffee drinkers. 
In fact, you can almost forget you’re drinking coffee with the sweetness of the white chocolate topped with whipped cream. Yes, getting any holiday drink without whipped cream or a cream foam is a crime. There is nothing in particular about white chocolate that makes it seasonal and yet this drink is so decadent it feels special. 
4) Peppermint Mocha 
Take coffee, add chocolate, add peppermint and top with whipped cream — you have attained a level of excellence most people can only hope for. If hot chocolate won’t do it for you and you must get work done, then the mocha is an acceptable substitute that gives you the caffeine you need to make it through another day. 
Peppermint is truly my favorite holiday flavor, as I will go on to expand later, and this drink combines all the different ingredients that make life worth living. Don’t trust my word for it? Go and give it a try and you will have no choice but to concede.  
3) Jade Citrus Mint Brewed Tea with Spearmint and Lemongrass 
While not a holiday exclusive and luckily available year-round for us tea drinkers, tea is the best way to keep warm as temperatures drop. Nothing about this screams holidays, but the Jade Citrus Mint Brewed Tea is the reminder we need that winter is fast approaching, and with it all our hopes and dreams for a new year. 
The name and flavors within the tea speak for themselves. Jade, citrus, mint, spearmint and lemongrass — what could go wrong? If you like mint, more mint and only mint, this could be all you need. 
2) Peppermint Hot Chocolate
Did you truly think any fall drinks listicle could be complete without hot chocolate? Hot chocolate is, and always will be, my go-to holiday drink. If any drink could be the holiday season in a cup, it has to be hot chocolate. I’m sorry, I don’t make the rules, but in the case of this listicle, I absolutely do.
I didn’t think anything could ever elevate or make hot chocolate even more delicious than it is already, but I must admit peppermint simply makes everything better. Having issues with your laptop? Peppermint. Don’t know how to ask for an extension on a paper? Peppermint. I’m kidding. Peppermint may be absolutely magical as a flavor and you may be able to bribe a friend or professor with it, but please don’t pour it on top of your laptop. I will go as far to say pumpkin must go because peppermint always wins the fall flavor battle.  
1) Irish Cream Cold Brew  
I am a firm believer in Irish Cream Cold Brew supremacy. I have simply not tasted another Starbucks drink that tasted better — seasonal menu or not. While missing the whiskey component of an actual Irish coffee, the drink comes very close to being Irish coffee in that “American fast food company trying to recreate a different culture in a cup” kind of way. I simply have no criticism. 
Each time the cocoa powder on top of the sweet frothy vanilla cream hits, I want to jump with joy. It’s hard to imagine getting through any morning class without my trusty Irish brew by my side. For a true, tried and tested method to elevate your coffee and take it to the next level, add some Baileys Irish Cream for the alcohol kick. Trust me!

No. 2 USC finished its regular season as the second best team in the MPSF conference and earned a first and second round bye in the MPSF tournament this weekend. The Trojans finished the regular season on a 5-game win streak.
The last time the Trojans saw competitive action occured nearly two weeks ago in a staple win against now No. 3 UCLA. USC won the game by 1 goal on senior night and was able to get a big confidence boost to end the regular season. The Bruins can reach the semifinal on Saturday against USC by defeating the winner of Austin College versus Penn State Behrend. 
“For us, to have that kind of mental advantage over them having already beaten them once this season is huge, but we’re not going to let that get to our heads too much,” senior goalie Nic Porter said. “They’re a wounded animal at the moment because they’ve lost two in a row and they’re going to be extremely dangerous, so we’ve got to be at our best to beat them.”
Sophomore driver Carson Kranz was a key contributor against the Bruins, scoring 2 goals and getting 1 steal in the victory. Kranz is confident in his team ahead of the expected matchup against UCLA. 
“UCLA is always gonna come back and be ready to play, and we prepared very well for the last game and we’re doing the same for this game, and it’s going to come down to our six on five,” Kranz said. “It’ll be a very tough game, but I think if we stick to our plan we should come out on top.”
Should USC win its semifinal game Saturday, the team will face either No. 1 UC Berkeley or No. 4 Stanford in the final Sunday. The Trojans have beaten Stanford, UCLA and Berkeley at least once each this season, and they have a high level of familiarity with those matchups. 
Head Coach Marko Pintaric has been in charge for three seasons, and he knows the difference between regular season and tournament preparation. 
“This is a different type of tournament,” Pintaric said. “You’re playing one game at a time. It’s different than getting yourself ready for just regular league games. It comes to the energy levels and trying to play out the whole weekend in order to stay consistent.”
USC is still vying for a spot in the NCAA tournament. The Trojans can qualify with an automatic bid by winning the MPSF tournament or by receiving an at-large bid.
“We want to go in there and win all of it and show all the teams that we’re the best,” Kranz said. “This weekend is very important to us, we want to go in there and stick it to everyone.”
USC will open the tournament Saturday at 11:15 a.m. at Avery Aquatic Center in Palo Alto, Calif. against the winner of UCLA and Penn State Behrend or Austin College. If the Trojans advance, they will play in the final Sunday at 2:45 p.m.

For all of you who missed out on a trip to the Bay Area last weekend or for those who already miss it, here’s a playlist that will let you imagine you’re there at any time. Whether it’s for pure escapism during these last few weeks of the semester or if you just really appreciate the culture, these tracks are perfect for understanding the greatness that comes from the Bay. 
There is no understanding of the Bay Area without understanding the Hyphy Movement (shoutout Keak da Sneak) that began in Oakland in the ‘90s and spread throughout the Bay in the early 2000s. From E-40 and SOB x RBE proudly repping Vallejo to Too Short and Kamaiyah out of Oakland, the Bay has been an incredible hub of hip-hop and culture that deserves all the credit. 
Although styles of hip-hop from the Bay Area have evolved throughout the years, you can still always tell through the beats and flow where it came from. Here is a playlist — and the order should be taken into consideration — that lets you experience the Bay from wherever you are. 
“Smoothies in 1991” by Larry June
Larry June is a new artist out of San Francisco, and he’s the latest big name repping the Bay Area. “Smoothies in 1991” is his most streamed song on Spotify and it’s for a good reason. It’s the perfect track to get you hooked on his music, and he has a sound that feels so classic despite his recent come up. It’s the perfect song for cruising and chillin’ out and sets you up nicely for the rest of these songs. 
“Bitch I Look Good” by Kool John ft. P-Lo
This song is just as smooth as the Larry June track, but the lyrics (and track name alike) make you feel like you need to get up and move to it. Kool John and P-Lo are both a part of HBK Gang — a hip-hop collective that includes other Bay Area legends, such as Iamsu!, Sage the Gemini and Jay Anthony — that has such a distinctive sound, you can tell exactly who it’s from. This song is a classic anthem in the Bay where just by listening to it you feel fly. 
“Windows” by Kamaiyah ft. Quavo & Tyga
Most would agree that driving in Los Angeles isn’t the most enjoyable experience, but this song makes you completely forget about that and want to pack up the car with your friends and blast this through the speakers. In true Bay Area fashion, Kamaiyah gives us a track that practically forces you to have a good time, and there’s no denying how catchy this song is. 
“Put Me on Somethin” by P-Lo ft E-40
One of the best things about Bay Area hip-hop is that the greats such as E-40 are supporting any and every up and coming artist that reps the same area. The feeling of family is essential to the culture and thanks to it, we get songs like this one where everyone, young and old, can go dumb to it. 
“Thizzle Dance” by Mac Dre
Every Mac Dre song deserves a spot on this playlist, and you probably have heard a good amount of them. “Thizzle Dance” is one of those songs that, regardless of how many times it’s played, never gets old. Mac Dre was a master at getting you to move to the beat and this track tells you exactly what to do. This song is so iconic that the “Thizzle Dance” is a staple when listening to any and all music from the hyphy movement. The Bay makes that music that gives you the stank face, in the best way. 
“Cupcake No Fillin” by Trunk Boiz
Another classic, there’s no denying that this song is widely loved by everyone in the Bay. Trunk Boiz, out of Oakland, were coined some of the best lyricists in the rap industry and were a true example of how intertwined hip-hop and Oakland culture was. Their first single “Scraper Bike” garnered national attention after introducing the world to East Oakland biker culture in its viral music video. “Cupcake No Fillin” has one of the catchiest hooks of all time and it sounds best when you’re singing along with your whole gang. 
“In This Life” by Lil Pete
A slower track, “In This Life” shows how it’s all about the grind and the long-awaited come up for these artists from the Bay. Authenticity is something so ingrained in the hip-hop scene, and this track perfectly captures that feeling where you know that you and your friends are going to make it. 
“All Me” by Kehlani ft. Keyshia Cole
If there’s any song that’s making people dance in the streets, it’s this one. Kehlani is the Bay Area’s sweetheart, and this track perfectly captures the chill, smooth production style that is so reflective of its essence. Closing this playlist, “All Me” reminds us to give credit where it’s due.

It’s 2100. We are living in the “metaverse”—self-driving cars line the streets, entrepreneurs craze over Bitcoin and college students teleport to their cyber-physical classrooms. It sounds like a technological marvel for some but a virtual dystopia for others.
For the foreseeable future, we may see some far-fetched science fiction ideas become scientifically possible. Telemedicine’s growth foregrounds a surge in telesurgery where doctors perform remote surgery on patients in other cities, states, continents or space.
You may nervously inquire, “Will there ever be such a thing as a doctorless hospital?” 
A life marked by mental illness or cancer may find itself in the hands of robots. Silicon Valley investors predict that robots have the potential to replace 90% of medical personnel in the hospital. A doctorless hospital sounds like a scene from a horror movie, but it will likely never become our reality. 
In the age of robotics and artificial intelligence, we will always need doctors and surgeons no matter how technologically advanced we become. 
In ophthalmology, for example, LASIK heavily relies on technology in its two-step procedure: the creation of the corneal flap and corneal reshaping with an excimer laser. Although the programmed excimer laser creates the corneal flap and reshapes the cornea, the ophthalmologist hand seals the corneal flap at the surgery’s beginning and end.
Dr. Lily Peng, a physician-scientist and product manager at Google Health, currently leads a team of clinicians, researchers and engineers studying artificial intelligence’s potential to help healthcare workers detect diabetic retinopathy at an earlier stage and prevent patient blindness. AI will improve healthcare by providing a faster and more accurate diagnosis through prediction of disease patterns; however, AI can only assist and not fully replace medical personnel because it lacks the sense of human camaraderie that is needed in the operating room.
Created in 2000, the da Vinci surgical robot is a two-armed machine that assists surgeons in performing complex, minimally invasive surgical procedures with precision and accuracy. To date, da Vinci technologies have performed more than 8.5 million procedures around the globe. 
Although technology offers brilliant solutions, they pale in comparison to what only we possess: the human brain.
Humans are innovative and capable of dealing with change and uncertainty. A master surgical plan is not always foolproof; if heart rate declines or breathing stops, only a trained surgeon can circumvent these unforeseen circumstances. We program machines to do repetitive and data-based tasks, while humans naturally conduct complex analyses and make difficult decisions on the spot.
Technologies cannot mimic empathy — we, as humans, naturally crave touch and interaction. Although patients do not interact with the surgeon during surgery, the process of building trust lies at the core of compassion: listening to the patient, respecting and understanding their concerns and acting in the best interest of the patient. 
USC offers interdisciplinary majors, such as health and the human sciences, to emphasize the “human” component in medicine, and classes such as “Introduction to Surgical Principles” develop students’ appreciation of surgery’s role in society. 
In the practice of medicine, a physician must be culturally competent and educated about the communities they serve to provide quality of healthcare at the highest caliber. Keck School of Medicine even offers a Master of Science in narrative medicine, which teaches the skills necessary to understand stories in the clinical setting. Consequently, the course helps students better understand the relationship between clinical medicine, public health and social justice.
Human doctors and surgeons can never become extinct. As we enter an age of exponentially developing technology, it is clear that robots may become an integral part of assisting in surgery rather than a replacement for surgeons.

Flamin’ Hot Cheetos saved my life. 
Yes, I realize I sound dramatic and that’s because I am — but it’s also true. 
Let me be clear: I’m not talking about just any old bag of Hot Cheetos off your local gas station shelf. No, I’m specifically talking about Hot Cheetos from the diner car on the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner train. 
To give you some context, it was five months into my health journey and things were pretty dire. At the time, my Mom and I were driving more than 120 miles multiple times a week from San Diego to Los Angeles to see my team of specialists. If it wasn’t the undiagnosed diseases ravaging this hot bod, the slog of a commute most definitely took its toll on me because, if you didn’t know, California is Satan’s butthole of traffic.
Let’s just say our loving relationship is intact today because we started taking the train to L.A. instead of driving. I mean, don’t get me wrong, going to L.A. was still an all day affair, but at least I could longingly gaze out the rainy window of the train and pretend I was in some nostalgic wattpad rom-com. 
And that’s when Hot Cheetos entered my life. 
On this particular day, we arrived at Union Station to take the usual 7 to 9 p.m. train home to San Diego, and I was seriously unwell. It was one of those days where, after back-to-back doctors appointments of being told “We’re still not sure why your body is attacking itself,” I had completely succumbed to the weight of my circumstances. 
I was mad, scolding my body like a small child as if I could guilt it into functioning properly. I laugh at that now, but in the moment I was terrified by how much weight I’d lost, the hair that was falling out of my head and the constant addition of pills to my already 20-pill regimen. I walked to our train, deeply mourning the life that my deteriorating health forced me to pause. In short, I wanted to curl up in a ball and cry — so, as soon as we got to our seats, I did. 
Naturally I did what any crying adult under stress would do and decided I needed to treat myself. I mustered all the strength of my withering body and waddled down to the diner car. With my nausea hunching me over and tears blurring my vision, I’m pretty sure people thought I’d just had one too many free screw-cap mini white wines.
I made my way downstairs to the tin shelves stocked with assorted goodies and, for some anointed reason, my eyes locked with this bag of Hot Cheetos. Suddenly, the mechanical hum of the train faded and I heard the bag whisper: “It’s OK, I’m here for you.”
I gently picked up the bag. Did it look like I was staring romantically at this bag of Hot Cheetos? Yes, it did, and that’s probably why the cashier asked me if I was OK. 
I checked out, stumbling back to my seat with Hot Cheetos clung to my chest and after that I looked schwasted, and cracked open the bag, letting the aroma fill my nostrils. 
I placed a Cheeto in my mouth and instantly began to sweat. It was like a thousand fire ants burst into a violent rave in my mouth. Maybe it was some masochistic kink surfacing — I didn’t care — I liked it, and it felt like just what the doctor ordered. 
My mom looked over confused because I hadn’t even been able to stomach saltines that morning — I was also confused. I didn’t know why, but in that moment, I felt hope. Not because I had dragged myself out of a depressive spiral, but because I had found something I actually wanted to eat. 
And so, it became a tradition. Every train ride home from L.A., I’d set my stuff down, make my way to the diner car, ask Earl about his kids at checkout and scurry back to my seat with my Hot Cheetos.
It became so much of a tradition that I couldn’t control my guttural urge for Hot Cheetos upon boarding. I looked forward to them. I thought of Hot Cheetos while giving blood from my again bruised arms, getting 30 injections of botox or while my head and joints pulsed with pain. Having something to look forward to, even something small like a bag of Hot Cheetos, gave me a finish line on those long, grueling days.
Did I know when I would return to school? No, but I knew I could count on Hot Cheetos. Did I know if I’d ever escape constant physical pain or ever get the peace of a diagnosis? Absolutely not, but I knew that while having my Hot Cheetos the scalding power of that spice would distract me from me for the time being. 
I now realize this tiny ritual of Hot Cheetos was doing much more than providing a fiery sensory symphony in my mouth, it became something I could rely on. I knew Hot Cheetos would be there for me when I made it back to the train. In my turbulent and spinning world of uncertainty with my health, Hot Cheetos on the train was something certain, and that kept me going. 
Did I know if I’d ever live independently again, or if my condition would prevent me from having kids, or if I’d die before my parents? Did I have any certainty about my future? No, but I didn’t need to think that far ahead yet, I just needed to make it to my Hot Cheetos. 
So I say Hot Cheetos saved my life because, at that moment, during that period of my life, with every train ride home, they did.
