Greeting students with an orange colored display portraying illustrated floral images and white ‘Latinx Heritage Month’ lettering, USC kicked off their cultural month celebrations with a virtual event Wednesday. The event served as a preview to the various festivities that will be held throughout the month, featuring an appearance from President Carol Folt. Gabriela Teissier, a Spanish anchor from Univision, served as the emcee for the online broadcast.
The program included participation from various students, faculty and alumni. Many colleges and organizations, including the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and the Latino Alumni Association, promoted or supported the kickoff through social media. Centered around the theme of esperanza, a celebration of Latinx heritage and hope, the event sought to promote positive messaging to Latinx Trojans and marginalized communities. 
“It’s a pleasure to join you as we kick off our celebration of Latinx history and culture,” said Folt as the event began. “This is an invitation for all of us to reflect on the contribution of Latinx Americans and an invitation to come together and look with hope, to the future.”
Folt acknowledged difference makers in the Latinx community, such as University trustee Frank Cruz, who co-founded the nation’s second Spanish-language television network Telemundo. Folt also recognized USC’s efforts to support the Latinx community, including the introduction of its first ever ethnic studies program in 1969, which would become today’s department of American Studies and Ethnicity, and the formation of various Latinx organizations such as the Latinx Chicanx Center for Advocacy and Student Affairs.
Following Folt’s appearance, the event continued with the appearance of more special guests, including Rossier School of Education Dean Pedro Noguera, who spoke about how his Latino and Caribbean heritage were critical to his development as a scholar and person. ​​César Chávez’s granddaughter and alumna Paloma Chávez also made an appearance and spoke about her experience combining her interest in journalism with activism. 
Special video dance performances from Grupo Folklórico de USC and Break on 2 Latin Fusion showcased two different dance genres in the online event. Grupo Folklórico de USC presented a performance using its Sones del Tierra y Mar March 2021 showcase.
“Just seeing how much recognition we got from just this event and the hard work, it’s really nice because a lot goes into the behind-the-scenes of all of these dances,” said Evelyn Marquez, a sophomore majoring in non-governmental organizations and social change and a member of Grupo Folklórico de USC. “What we also try to do with our instructor [is] emphasize the learning about the cultural significance of our dances and the history of them too.”
Break on 2 Latin Fusion performed its 2019 Spring Showcase, in which the group presented its Latin dance style. Co-director Debbie Fagan said she was happy about the opportunity to share the team’s work. 
“We’re really excited that [the organizers] decided to reach out to us,” said Fagan, a senior majoring in political science. “We wanted to make sure that we showcased our Latin heritage. It’s really awesome that we’re able to do that here on campus and feel supported in that.”
The conclusion of the kickoff to Latinx Heritage Month ended with Teissier encouraging students and staff to enjoy the month-long celebration. Martha Escutia, vice president for State Government Relations of USC, was featured in a video segment where she presented the Latinx history behind the founding of Los Angeles. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Escutia explained she wanted to do something different than talk about her own personal life. 
“It was a great honor, because I was chosen by the USC staff assembly to represent them in doing this,” Escutia said. “That in itself is a great honor to be recognized by your peers, to represent them in such an important thing to kick off Latino heritage month, and so I took it really seriously, and for me, every opportunity is a teachable moment.”
Patricia Alarcón, the relationship manager for USC Educational Partnerships, who served on the subcommittee of diversity, equity and inclusion and oversaw the organizations and assemblies setting up the event, had a positive reception to the webinar.
“From wherever we come from, hope and esperanza, to do our best. To celebrate such an event  — humanity being together and I just paused because I think thwis was a very emotional event in terms of having powerful speakers that were from students, staff, administration, our President,” Alarcón said.

USC ranked No. 27 in the U.S. News & World Report’s 2022 college rankings, three spots lower than last year. The results, released Monday, marked the University’s first decline to the No. 27 slot since 2008.
U.S. News & World Report decided by scoring colleges across 15 academic categories including class size, student-faculty ratio, selectivity of admissions and alumni donations. 
Retaining and graduating students within six years are also considered factors, accounting for more than one-third of a school’s rank. The report also looks at faculty salary, academic reputation, financial resources and average ACT and SAT scores of existing students.
After gathering the data, the U.S. News & World Report formulates a score out of 100 to determine the rank. While USC’s overall ranking dropped, this year the University scored 79, a one-point increase from the previous year. 
The top 10 institutions listed in the report were all private universities. Non-academic elements like social life and athletics are not included.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, USC Vice President for Enrollment Management Kedra Ishop wrote that the University is aware of the recent rankings and acknowledged that the rank is among the many factors students consider when choosing a university. Ishop also highlighted that the admissions office recently admitted the most selective and talented class in USC history.
“[Our first-year class] is a testament to our broad and sustained appeal to talented young people around the state, nation and world and one that we expect to continue as we share with a new class of prospective students why we are among the leading universities in the world and why USC might be the right place for them,” Ishop said. 
Director of USC’s Annenberg School of Journalism Gordon Stables said, while college rankings serve as a “benchmark” for students and a way to distinguish different universities, the weight the ratings carry varies by person. 
“There’s a series of different indexes that mean different things to different people,” said Stables in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “But you can use it as a jumping off point to say for a student with my academic profile, what are my odds of getting admitted [into a specific university].”
Stables said he believes students should examine the entire landscape of a school and consider their best fit when applying to college. 
“What’s the best fit in terms of student life, academic programs, opportunity mentored with faculty, community that will be supportive [and] career opportunities,” Stables said. “For me, the common element is every one of USC students has a different experience. So the idea that there’s a single USC experience doesn’t not help.”
Leslie Moreno, a freshman majoring in computer science and computer engineering, said she considered the U.S. News & World Report rankings but incorporated other qualitative factors — such as the school’s academic rigor, mental health resources and social life balance — when deciding where to attend college.
“I wanted a good work and social life balance where I would be able to unwind after being stressed from academics,” Moreno said. “A college’s social life impacts the environment of a school and its students’ happiness, so it would make sense to include it in the ranking criteria.” 
Moreno said rankings should consider mental health resources when creating rankings, as she chose to attend USC in part because of what she found to be a nontoxic environment for engineering students.
“USC in general has a lot of resources for students whenever they need help, not only mental health … but there’s a lot of resources for everything. I felt that going to Viterbi I would have a good selection of people that I can fall back on,” Moreno said.
Moreno commended the Viterbi School of Engineering for reaching gender parity in their program.
“Especially in computer science, the field can get pretty toxic when it’s not a good combination of men and women,” said Moreno. “Being the only girl in the class is always an uncomfortable feeling — so just knowing that Viterbi had a dedication for reaching 50-50 and reached 50-50 the year I came in. That was huge because I wanted to make sure I felt comfortable in my classes.”
Moreno said she was surprised USC saw a dip in their ratings, citing more selective admission statistics and the University delivering a “top-tier” education.
For Stables, he was not surprised to see USC’s rank drop, citing the U.S. News & World Report rankings’ tendency to fluctuate by year. 
“There are years it’s going to go up, there’s years it’s going to go down. I think the biggest thing is you know from talking to admissions — where the student interest is, you know from talking to the academic programs where the quality students are — beyond that some of these things are a little harder to control,” Stables said. “Unless you can tie [the rankings change] specifically to a university adding new degree programs [and having] a dramatic financial crisis, I think it’s often hard to draw causal connections between the rankings and anything else.” 
When the pandemic-related closures forced many universities to transition online, some high school students were unable to access standardized test scores. In response, USC announced it would implement a test-optional policy for students seeking admission. 
In February 2021, the admissions office announced the extension of the policy for two additional academic years. Stables said he believes the abnormal standardized testing will affect college rankings for the foreseeable future, potentially leading to shifts in the overall rankings. 
“At this moment, the biggest change in a lot of universities is what’s happening without standardized testing. I think that’s an area where I don’t even think these ratings have captured it, but I envision the biggest changes in years,” Stables said. “But it’s hard because the things that happen within a university within any given year aren’t captured.”
Stables said he encourages students to strike the right balance between finding a rigorous course program and a campus community where they feel supported.
“I would encourage folks to think about the campus culture and campus climate,” Stables said. Because your roommates, the people you’re going to be in student organizations with, the people you’re going to become friends with that support your community — that’s not going to be limited by your academic program. So you want to be in a place that has their culture that resonates with you.”

For three and a half years, researchers investigated renewable energy and its economic impacts. On Sept. 1, citing the research — which included contributions from USC Professors George Ban-Weiss, Kelly Sanders and Dan Wei — the Los Angeles City Council voted to move up 100% reliance on renewable energy by 2035, a decade earlier than the previous 2045 goal.
Published in March, LA100 was commissioned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 
Following the release of LA100, Wei and Rose presented their findings at the International Conference for the International Association for Energy Economics in June. LA100 informed city leaders of the health, water and economic impacts of L.A.’s change to 100% renewable energy and its feasibility as the Council voted to move up the deadline.
Rose, who began working on LA100 in June 2018, has conducted research with Wei for 15 years on the shift to clean energy’s impact on the economy. Rose and Wei have analyzed job markets in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and other states in addition to California. 
“It turns out that in almost 90% of the cases, looking at various variants of the plan, the result was a net increase in the number of jobs, of climate change action plans in general, which included things like shifting to renewable electricity,” Rose said.
Rose and Wei contributed to chapter 11 of the LA100 report, titled “Economic Impacts and Jobs.” With an initial deadline of 2045, the report looked at the time period of 2026 to 2045 and modeled different scenarios, finding that job market opportunities could range from 3,600 fewer jobs to 4,700 additional jobs with a switch to renewable energy.
“While there may be slight positive or negative impacts, these changes are small in relationship to the 3.9 million jobs and $200 billion in annual output of L.A.’s economy as a whole, so they have an almost negligible impact,” the LA100 Executive Summary read. 
Emy Li, a sophomore majoring in applied mathematics and economics and a member of the Environmental Student Assembly, said moving the deadline up is a “completely understandable action to take.”
“Setting these goals for policymakers and researchers is important moving forward, so everyone can really see how urgent this issue is,” Li said.
Ban-Weiss and Sanders, associate professors of civil and environmental engineering, conducted research related to air quality and water, respectively. 
According to Ban-Weiss’ research, “Our analysis suggests that the LA100 scenarios show citywide reductions in total air pollutant emissions of up to 62% for [oxides of nitrogen] and 11% [fine particulate matter], relative to a current scenario.”
Additionally, Ban-Weiss and his team found that reductions were larger in disadvantaged communities compared to non-disadvantaged communities.
“When weighted by the costs of each health effect, the overall changes to air quality from LA100 scenarios could provide hundreds of millions of dollars — and up to nearly $1.5 billion — in monetized benefits in the year 2045,” the report read.
Sanders researched water systems at LADWP and quantified the amount of electricity required by the entire water system, which includes water recycling, wastewater treatment facilities and any other water pumping processes. 90% of L.A.’s drinking water is currently imported from distant sources, including Northern California, the Colorado River and the California Aqueduct, Sanders said. 
LADWP will now work toward increasing local water sources by revamping stormwater projects, which collect precipitation and treat that water to replenish water supply. While helping with sustainability because it avoids pumping water for more than hundreds of miles, performing the water treatment in L.A. County will increase water electricity consumption, Sanders said.
“Even though the total energy consequences of our water supply as a whole aren’t going to change that much, where that electricity is provided changes quite a bit,” Sanders said. “So the city of Los Angeles is going to increase its consumption of electricity for water quite a bit in the future.”
After finding that more energy will be used to treat locally-sourced water, Sanders and her team passed their results to the energy modeling team, who anticipated how this increase can be offset through the use of renewable energy.  
With this research compiled in LA100, the city council voted to advance the deadline by a decade.
“The evidence mounts every day that climate change is here. And it’s doing significant damage,” Rose said. “So the earlier we address it, the better.”
Sanders said moving up the target date is promising for L.A., a city that is committed to transitioning to renewable energy. 
“It’s going to be a huge challenge,” Sanders said. “But I think that by making [the 2035 deadline], it’s really going to accelerate our movements towards those goals.”

In September 2013, USC’s head coach Lane Kiffin was fired on a tarmac at the LAX airport by athletic director Pat Haden after a 62-41 loss to Arizona State. The previous season, Kiffin’s 2012 team was a National Championship favorite and had earned a preseason No. 1 AP ranking, but the Trojans ended up going 7-6, finishing off the season with an embarrassing 21-7 loss to Georgia Tech. After Kiffin’s lackluster 3-2 start to the 2013 season, Haden had seen enough. 
The USC fanbase was down and morale was low. The Trojans then went on a 6-1 run, winning five in a row under the leadership of interim head coach Ed Orgeron. That run included a 20-17 upset victory over No. 4 Stanford in front of a sold-out Coliseum. Fans stormed the field. The band created a new chant. It was a magical time to be a Trojan.
It is now 2021. Athletic Director Mike Bohn fired former head coach Clay Helton in September. Interim head coach Donte Williams stepped up to the plate, just like Orgeron did, and now he has a chance to do something just as special. USC still has a very favorable remaining schedule, and all of the team’s games are winnable. There is still a lot to look forward to, just like there was in 2013 after Kiffin’s dismissal.
Washington State will be the first test that USC will have without Helton. Last year, the Trojans blew the Cougars out of the water, scoring 28 points in the first quarter alone and winning 38-13. Sitting at 1-1 this season, the Cougars lost a close season-opener against Utah State but bounced back last Saturday with a comfortable victory against Portland State. 
Given the coaching change, this game against the Cougars could be shaky, and it would not be a surprise if the game was close. A win here for USC would be a huge momentum-starter for Williams, and if he blows the Cougars out, it could provide the momentum needed to get a win streak going.
After the road trip to Pullman, the Trojans will return home to the Coliseum to face Oregon State Sept. 25. If USC handles Washington State, there’s a good chance the Coliseum will be buzzing with fans hyped to witness a new head coach lead the team for the first time since 2015. Facing the Trojans at home, the Beavers have only gone 8-13 overall since 2019. 
The Trojans have no excuse to lose this game. If they win, it will be an opportunity for the fans at the Coliseum to rally around Williams and show him their full-fledged support.
The matchups against Washington State and Oregon State will be the Trojans’ most important opportunities to find their footing with Williams, but their toughest opponents will not come until October and November. Perhaps the toughest matchup of the season will come Oct. 23, when USC travels to South Bend, Ind. to face No. 12 Notre Dame. Notre Dame’s two victories this season have looked anything but dominant, but USC hasn’t won in South Bend since 2011. If USC is ever going to break that streak, this is the season to do it. 
The Fighting Irish barely squeaked by Florida State in overtime to win their first game of the season. That same Florida State team just lost to an FCS opponent in Jacksonville State at home Saturday. Notre Dame almost lost last week as well, but a last-minute touchdown gave the Irish a victory over Toledo. 
Arizona State and UCLA will be the other two toughest matchups of the season for the Trojans. Both teams remain undefeated and ranked in the top-20 of the current AP Poll. UCLA defeated SEC powerhouse LSU Sept. 4.
The bottom line is this: USC was picked to win the Pac-12 South with 27 first place votes for a reason. Helton’s removal does not take away any of the talent that is overwhelmingly present on USC’s roster. If Williams can find a way to harness that talent, win early against the Cougars and Beavers and clean up the unnecessary penalties and mistakes, then he and the Trojans can be as successful as they want to be.

We’re out of the storm now. 
We’ve had a few weeks to reflect on the first three matches of the United States Men’s National Team’s World Cup Qualifying campaign. Five points from the first three games certainly wasn’t the plan, but I hate to admit that I still have hope for this team. That’s not to say the team is without its question marks, though. Now that I’ve had a chance to examine each game without being overly reactionary, it’s time for me to give my two cents on what 11 players should be starters moving forward. 
In goal, I have to say I’ve been impressed with Matt Turner. His Gold Cup campaign was one to remember, but I had my doubts on how he would translate his success to the next level in qualifying. Usual first-choice keeper Zack Steffen’s availability issues have given us a chance to see Turner and Ethan Horvath step up as viable No. 1 keepers. All this being said, club prestige is a big factor in this equation. Steffen has to stop shots from some of the world’s best players on a daily basis at Manchester City — that’s something Turner and Horvath can’t say. Based on what I’ve seen from all of them in a USMNT shirt, I’d be satisfied with any of the three in the net for the foreseeable future, but my preference remains with Steffen. 
Centerback Miles Robinson is the rock of the USMNT defense. That’s a sentence I never thought I would be writing, yet here I am, saying it with my chest. He too emerged from his Gold Cup success as a starter and made it evident as to why he deserved to stay in the lineup. Robinson’s composed nature at the back helps to settle down the defense in possession, but don’t sleep on his tackling skills and aerial prowess.
Sadly, with the rise of Robinson, we’ve seen a stark regression in centerback John Brooks. He was once the stalwart of the U.S. defense, and his iconic goal vs Ghana in the 2014 World Cup will go down as one of my favorite USMNT memories. Unfortunately, he’s lost a step, and it’s pretty apparent. His lack of defensive awareness and poor positioning directly led to the U.S. conceding against both Canada and Honduras. It’s really sad to see because his leadership and technical skills are, for the most part, still a plus, but I think it’s time manager Gregg Berhalter begins to phase him out of the starting 11.
For fullbacks, I really just want to say three things. One, Antonee Robinson should be starting every match at left back. Two, Sergiño Dest should be starting every match at right back. And three (hope you’re reading this one especially, Gregg), don’t ever play midfielder Tyler Adams at right back again. It’s really that simple.
Picking a three-man midfield is often the most difficult task for a manager with a lot of options, so I don’t really blame Berhalter for not quite figuring it out yet. That being said, I think we’ve had enough game time to determine who should be where, and it is as follows: Tyler Adams at defensive midfielder, Weston McKennie at box-to-box (if he can hold off on violating team protocols) and Brenden Aaronson at attacking midfielder. 
Adams should have his spot in the 11 solidified, as he captained the team in the El Salvador match and backed it up with influential defensive play. He’s the definition of a guy who knows how to serve his role. McKennie’s absence was felt in the final two games of the most recent qualifying window, even after a lackluster performance in the first match. He’s undoubtedly America’s most talented pure central midfielder, and his ability to lead the transition from defense to attack is unmatched. Aaronson secured his spot in my team after displaying clutch attacking positioning and clinical finishing ability against Canada and Honduras. We’ve seen him out wide as well, but it was when he drifted into the central channels that he made his biggest contributions, scoring both of his goals from this position.
Now the front three, which was the main concern of the first two and a half games, as attacking chances were few and far between with a need for new ideas as winger Christian Pulisic described it. Assuming he’s healthy enough to play, Pulisic will be the captain at left wing, and this is non-negotiable. At right wing, I’d like to see Giovanni Reyna. There have been calls to play him more central in an attacking midfield role so as to get him more involved in the attack, but I’ve liked what I’ve seen from him as a winger. For me, he was one of very few bright spots in the El Salvador game. His pure dribbling ability and pace are marquee traits of a good winger, and he’s talented enough to find his way into games even when he’s not in the middle. 
Now, the ever-so-controversial No. 9 spot. I will be the first person to defend striker Josh Sargent despite a lack of goal contributions. His mobility and intelligent running brought creativity back to the attack when he was on the field. Where he falls short is the finishing touch, and since that’s such a key feature of a striker, I don’t think Berhalter has him as his first choice, and neither do I. That title goes to 18-year-old Ricardo Pepi. Pepi earned his first ever start as a USMNT player against Honduras, and despite struggling to find his footing in the first half, he made his mark with a headed goal to put the U.S. ahead in the 75th minute. Pepi didn’t stop there, dishing an assist to Aaronson and nearly scoring a second goal on a shot which was tapped in on the rebound as the fourth U.S. goal of the night. Pepi’s performance may not have been as magical as it seems to a box-score watcher — he definitely had moments where his inexperience showed — but it was a massively encouraging performance nonetheless. For that, he gets the start at striker in my team. 
Injuries and absences could impede Berhalter from playing a full-strength team, and we’re still a few weeks out from the next game against Jamaica in Austin, Tex. If the lineup that I’ve just laid out is available and healthy, I’m confident it would provide the most balanced look for the USMNT and give the Americans a chance to get nine points from their next three games.

“DEATHLOOP” is the swan song many gamers have searched for during the console generation. Bethesda Softworks and Arkane Studios’ latest project comes during a time of next-gen console shortages and a drought of new, triple-A game releases that are not console exclusives. It’s a huge relief that “DEATHLOOP” is most likely Arkane’s greatest game yet. 
In “DEATHLOOP,” the player takes control of Colt, an amnesiac assassin who wakes up on the labyrinthian Blackreef Island and must kill eight people known as “Visionaries” to break the time loop he is stuck in. Should Colt die three times in a day, the loop resets and he must start over from scratch, losing all the equipment gained but luckily retaining any information learned. This repetitive yet engrossing cycle slowly unravels the mystery behind Colt’s amnesia and gives the player more tools to work with during each loop.
Given that “DEATHLOOP” is a true “next-gen exclusive,” It would be a tragedy if I didn’t discuss the game’s graphics. To put it simply: the game is a vibrant nightmare. A bright color palette permeates throughout the game, basking the player in gorgeous, bright alternate-1970s environments and character models. The PS5 version also comes with three graphics modes: Performance, Quality, and Raytracing, each successively sacrificing frames per second for visual quality and raytracing, a rendering technique that allows in-game lighting to behave almost as it would in real life. Personally, I am a fan of a smooth 60 FPS over visual fidelity, but each mode offers its own experience, and I would recommend trying both for yourself.
The graphic fidelity also lends itself to the setting of Blackreef, an island of decadence and arrogance separated into four zones: Updaam, The Complex, Fristad Rock and Karl’s Bay. Each area exhibits stylistic qualities of the 1970s while also representing the Visionaries who call these areas home. Colt’s past with all the Visionaries serves to hinder him as each belongs to different fields of expertise. The Visionaries’ singular desire to kill Colt creates unique and individualistic environments that Colt has to navigate. Updaam’s European urban center contrasts well with Fristad Rock’s fjord-like areas or Karl’s Bay’s seaside bays. 
Combat still packs a punch in both stealth and shooting in “DEATHLOOP,” even in the face of Colt’s status as the weakest of Arkane’s protagonists. Grizzly stealth takedowns done in all sorts of bone-crushing and terrifying, brutal ways feel as satisfying as shooting an enemy with a headshot from a pneumatic nail gun found earlier through exploration. Arkane’s refinement of their combat systems reveals itself here, as “DEATHLOOP” feels like a pinnacle of their previous work while still giving it enough differentiation to stand on its own.
With the premise of time resets and an “efficient killing trumps indiscriminate murder” mentality, “DEATHLOOP” certainly lavishes the player with opportunity and choice in its opening hours. A core component of Colt’s amnesia is that there are other versions of himself that have already completed tasks and exploration before the player. The game actively helps and hinders the player by having the other Colt “talk” to you telepathically through communication that ends up as text displayed above or on objects and scenery. The jarring nature of being given constant guidance and the complete freedom to disregard it gives “DEATHLOOP’’ a unique take on player agency. It also means that other characters in the game have other versions of themselves, including Julianna, one of the eight Visionaries who actively impedes your progress by taunting you and invading your game in order to kill you.
Julianna’s inclusion as a recurring invading enemy, controlled by either an AI or another online player, adds to the narrative and the pace of combat. The constant threat of not only the regular enemies but another person who is on an equal level to Colt reinforces the need for efficient planning and the idea that the player is prey being hunted, turning the tables once they become sufficiently powerful.
This feeling of independence also extends to the plot. While modern video game narratives have been lengthy and climactic in recent years, with games like “God of War” and “Final Fantasy VII Remake” being more akin to movies with gameplay elements, “DEATHLOOP’’ keeps its story surprisingly simple. Colt’s mission is to kill eight people in a day and escape the time loop. 
That’s it. 
While there is much to discover about the eight targets and why Blackreef island even exists, the plot does not deviate much from the fact that Colt needs to hunt them down, at least in the first couple hours. This is quite a departure from Arkane’s previous games. “Dishonored 1,” “Dishonored 2” and “Prey” all had world-building laid out through discoverable documents and environmental storytelling, letting the player understand the immediate conflicts at hand while subtly revealing things about the in-game world. 
“DEATHLOOP”’s informational dialogue, collectibles and environments all serve to detail the main character, the Visionaries and the setting, speaking of little else. While this change is not poorly implemented, some fans may yearn for a narrative closer to Arkane’s previous works.
“DEATHLOOP” feels like being stranded in a bad dream and having to repeat it every day. Each day feels as miserable as the last but gaining that little bit of ground on it, leaving you satisfied and ready for another. 
The strong and visceral combat, the minimal yet engaging narrative and the freedom the player is offered in operating culminate in an experience that is not only next-gen but genre-defining.

Is your soul full? No, really. Answer the question; it’s really important. Do you feel fulfilled today? 
Fulfillment means different things to different people. To me, fulfillment is feeling driven, passionate; inspired in a way that leads you to explore and feel curious. Fortunately, if your soul has yet to be fulfilled today, you’re in the right place. In this column, I serve food for the soul in the medium of pride in our fellow peers for the way they impact both the USC community and the world around us. 
Every person you encounter has some kind of inspiration that brought them to where they are today. Sometimes, when trapped inside a day that consists of a class-to-class routine, it can be difficult to be reminded of our “why.” 
When our “why” is threatened by the monotonous structure of life as a college student, our souls yearn to be fulfilled. Now, don’t confuse this for being more driven to attend class, we’re looking for something deeper. Instead, our “why” is reflected in what we’re passionate about. Are you driven by the joy of drinking a quality coffee in the morning? Are you motivated after working one-on-one with an elementary student on their reading? Are you ready for the day after you created your first scene in a webtoon? Any of these, along with a myriad of other possible passions, are examples of the most important aspects of personhood — our collective “why.”
Seeing others light up when asked “What are you passionate about?” motivated me to create this column. My column, “Food for the Soul,” will be your source of inspiration for as long as you need it. “Food for the Soul” will highlight the lives of creatives in our community and how they share their art and passions with the world. In a world where focusing on one’s self is crucial to succeeding in academics and your preferred career progression, my column will be a place for your spirit to explore the many passions of your classmates around you.
As a World Bachelors in Business student, I don’t regularly encounter creatives, despite their passion for their specialties being the most profound determination I have ever encountered. After speaking with students pursuing arts and entertainment at random — FYI, dining hall lines are great for networking — I have reason to believe that each of us can be driven by the sheer amount of ideas and experiences of these students. 
One student I met is working to increase the representation of African Americans in media through animation. Another wrote five plays during their high school career, with three of them performed in their community. Their passion is enough to feed anybody’s spirit. 
Most importantly, fulfillment requires grounding, and I got you for that too! Well, international grounds, that is. Since my column is catered to placing you in the creative center of our University, we will also explore how the passions of students on campus interconnect with art and entertainment movements around the world. While our “why” is important, our “so” is equally as critical. Our “so” is what produces the impact we seek to create. From the Afro-Cuban hip hop movement to the mockery of mass media in the works of KAWS, creativity always has an impact that deserves exploration. 
Innovation exists all around us, and it’s up to us to explore the realm of possibilities that lie within it. Through “Food for the Soul,” I will explore how the innovators of the USC community work hard to push the bar of possibilities and how this relates to the importance of arts and entertainment throughout the world, to further emphasize the strength of arts and entertainment as a mechanism for change. In a world where the pursuit of arts and entertainment can be deemed “unrealistic” in the eyes of a mathematician, I strive to create an environment where these pursuits are just as important as “typical” pathways.

From social media campaigns to live music shows, Amplify USC is the on-campus hub for USC’s music scene and artist promotion.
Working to promote the work of USC musicians to the student body, Amplify creates a place for artists to grow their presence and for students to connect with on-campus music culture. Through a variety of media forms such as Instagram, blogging, artist takeovers and live events, Amplify has created a unique space for artists at USC. 
“In this industry, it is really all about passion and supporting other artists. It’s about how connected everyone is within the music industry and how everyone just wants to support each other,” said Ronia Waltl, a senior majoring in communications who manages social media for Amplify.
Waltl described the submission-based process Amplify uses to find new artists to support and promote as well as how design team’s work with the artist. The team creates a “vision board” for the artist, as well as an artist feature that is similar to a magazine spread. 
“The most exciting part is always the support for the amazing artists on campus here. When someone says, ‘I added this artist [to] my playlist because I saw them on your platform,’ that’s always exciting to hear,” Waltl said.
Katie Sunada, a senior majoring in communications, works for Amplify, primarily as a writer. She described what makes Amplify USC an important organization. 
“I think it’s really cool to have a platform that’s just focused on the artists that’s promoting them.” Sunada said. “As a music fan myself, I love having one place that I can go to see who the new upcoming USC artists [are].” 
With the return to campus, Amplify has shifted a lot of its attention to putting on live shows to get more experience and exposure for its artists.
Last Friday, Amplify hosted an event at the venue, El Cid, which featured Casey Malanuk, Ellie Williams and Kate Grahn. This was Ampify’s first live show during the coronavirus pandemic, which was planned over the summer by Waltl and Sophie Feldman, a senior in the pop music performance program. The two began planning the event in June by searching for the right venue and eventually developing a lineup. 
The artists started practicing together over the summer to learn new songs as a group and get back to performing after a long time where live performances weren’t possible. Remi Frogo, a member of the design team and USC Roski student, designed posters and began fervently promoting the event two weeks prior, which included an Instagram takeover with each artist. 
Feldman, who is also known by her stage name, “Jackson,” was one of the performers at Friday’s event. It was her first in-person show since the coronavirus pandemic began and was where she debuted the stage name. The event also marked her first performance with completely original music.
“I was excited to debut all of that material and see it hit an audience for the first time, especially after such a long lapse of having no live music in our lives,” Feldman said. “It was absolutely euphoric to be in that context again.” 
Feldman spent a long time perfecting her originals and went into the performance feeling confident that she was presenting music that belonged to this project.
“At the beginning of spring semester last year, I’ve been working on getting that branding figured out and learning more about marketing myself as an artist,” Feldman said. “So shifting focus more on to myself has been really interesting and all of the songs that I played on Friday were songs that I specifically wrote for me as ‘Jackson.’”
Feldman intends to continue promoting her music through Amplify as well.
“When I start releasing music, I’m planning to definitely promote things through Amplify,” Feldman said. “I love doing the Instagram takeovers with them, so whatever I can do to stay linked and be involved in the USC artists community, I’m going to keep doing.” 
A huge crowd turned out for the performance, with a successful presale and even more tickets purchased at the door. Frogo sold prints of her personal artwork at the show as well, adding to the artistic scene at the event.
Sunada was able to attend the live event and experience Amplify’s production.
“I think it’s always really amazing when you go to shows for artists from USC … because it’s amazing to see your peers and see how talented they are,” Sunada said.
Amplify will continue to throw live events and scout artists within the community to increase its audience and local support. Moving forward, Amplify will place a big emphasis on live events to increase exposure for its musicians, while still following the coronavirus guidelines that had previously hindered live music for so long.
Amplify’s central message is to uplift creatives early in an artist’s career, providing community support and exposure to continue growing their success. Within the USC community, Amplify taps into support for these artists, emphasizing the importance of networking in the music industry.
“I think as a young artist, it’s really important to have that exposure and to get coverage in any way,” Sunada said. “So I think it’s important that we are giving a platform for these artists who are really up and coming.” 
Amplify USC is hosting a second live event — a house show— on Sept. 24 on 29th St.

USC’s inconsistent stance toward its coronavirus policies is dangerous for the student population. To address this indecisiveness, USC should reexamine whether or not these policies exist for optics or to have a legitimate impact.
For the tens of thousands of freshmen and sophomores who stepped foot onto USC’s campus for the first time in mid-August, USC has simultaneously embodied nearly draconian and extremely relaxed safety measures, which can often lead to confusion and misunderstanding surrounding USC’s policies. 
USC’s dorms, for example, have a strict “No Guest” policy, presumably due to the nature of coronavirus and the need to limit in-person interaction. However, USC itself has hosted multiple events that seem to spit in the face of its own coronavirus regulations — from convocation, made up of hundreds of tightly-filled rows of students, to the Welcome Week concert, with thousands of students jam-packed into McCarthy Quad. 
Although students may have masked up for convocation and were told to do so for the Welcome Week concert, videos on Instagram show crowds with masks pulled down at the USC Concerts event. These types of discrepancies, while not entirely USC’s fault, point out the University’s problems with coronavirus-related policies. 
USC’s gym policies have also received ire for their inefficiency, seemingly enacted with little purpose or practicality. Currently, it is extremely difficult to reserve spots in the two gyms at University Park Campus — Lyon Recreation Center and the USC Village Fitness Center — with students often competing with one another to reserve a spot exactly 48 hours in advance. 
The University enacts these policies to presumably maintain coronavirus regulations, but inside the gym, it’s clear these restrictions are only to be taken at face value. Even with gym goers wearing masks, the gyms often become crowded. As the only active gym restriction seems to be the mask mandate, it calls into question why the gyms need to use a reservation system that only inconveniences its students rather than ensure their safety. 
The most egregious of faults is the way USC approaches football games, no doubt a source of immense profit for the University. On Aug. 25, athletic director Mike Bohn emailed the student body, notifying students that there would be no tailgates held on campus for the Sept. 4 game due to “a responsibility to prioritize the health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff.” 
However, the same email also stated that “this change has only been made for the first game,” presumably so USC could reassess and potentially allow tailgates on campus in the future. The actual game, however, was held with minimal safety-related restrictions, with only a paltry reminder that masks were required. More photos, however, show many students without masks. How can USC cancel tailgates in the name of coronavirus restrictions, yet allow the actual game to continue at full capacity with minimal restrictions being put in place? USC also announced on Sept. 8 that the next game would feature tailgates (albeit on a limited scale), a move that will no doubt attract attention over coronavirus statistics in the coming weeks. 
Through all of these problems, USC’s common solution is Trojan Check, the new program that allows students to quickly check whether or not they suffer from any coronavirus symptoms to be allowed on campus. 
It is a simple proposal, but it doesn’t seem to be extremely effective when considering the fact that it is extremely easy to lie on Trojan Check, and the campus entryways have simply waved students into campus when a large number of them arrive on campus at once. One post on USC’s subreddit “r/USC” shows students attempting to “speedrun” the Trojan Check, with one user writing code to automatically fill it out. USC’s reliance on Trojan Check, while initially well-guided, ultimately falls flat, as the program itself can easily be manipulated by simply lying. 
The solution, unfortunately, is not one that easily comes to mind; any system that requires “honor” can easily be bypassed. However, devoting time to revisiting Trojan Check could well be worth USC’s time, as its place in the University ecosystem exists as nothing more than an inconvenience as it currently functions. 
Whether its policies pertain to housing, workouts, football games, tailgates or more, USC follows a consistent theme of only implementing coronavirus-based restrictions to simply save face without actually going through the efforts of ensuring all students follow through. 
It must be noted that, despite the many grievances listed above, it is not as though the current methods USC is utilizing to combat the coronavirus aren’t completely working; in fact, USC has reported promising testing results, with the most recent numbers revealing that the positivity rate was only 0.2% for the third week of college. However, the road to full normalcy cannot be paved without USC first reevaluating their guidelines.
Ultimately, these coronavirus restrictions only inconvenience students, while USC overlooks larger issues, such as massive crowds. As we go further into the school year, it’s absolutely imperative that USC reexamines its own safety policies and just how useful they are.

In January of this year, the College Board, which develops exams for college admissions programs, stated it would eliminate the essay-writing proportion of the SAT. Advocates for the decision specified several criticisms with the essay portion, including bias against underrepresented groups. For example, a case study by Duke University economics professor Peter Arcidiacono found that Asian-American students were rated lower on “positive personality traits” such as likability, courage, and kindness.  
 A couple of months later, the University of California collegiate system announced that they unanimously voted to make the SAT and ACT optional for two years before eventually dropping them as requirements. 
These two decisions are a big win for high school students. 
Exams such as the SAT and Advanced Placement are incredibly time-consuming and overwhelming if students have an intense high school workload. Students who take these exams and participate in their courses are also more prone to stress and panic attacks. 
Additionally, these exams are high cost. In 2019, a standard SAT exam costs $52 and can rise to $68 if the student plans on taking the essay portion of the exam. On the other end, the most recent standard ACT costs $60 and $85 with the essay section.
Even though there are fee waivers, college counselors typically advise high school students to take the tests more than once. Consequently, families can spend hundreds of dollars for students to earn competitive scores on these exams. This makes college testing a multimillion-dollar industry. 
The College Board is a non-profit organization that expanded access to higher education by administering the PSAT, SAT and AP exams. However, it now operates as a lucrative and robust business. In 2017, it made over $1 billion in profits from managing exams and increased its earnings to $1.2 billion in 2020. 
By generating this much revenue from their exams, the organization has about $1.1 billion in savings and investments. According to Forbes, top College Board executives have put $160 million in tax havens in the Caribbean, with possibly more in hidden accounts in Mauritius. Hence, the College Board created a large educational empire with the public’s wealth and minimum transparency.
Meanwhile, the College Board’s CEO, David Coleman, has a nearly $2 million salary while other top executives make $300,000 to $500,000 per year.  
Since no other corporation distributes PSAT, SAT and AP exams, the College Board has a monopoly on education, controlling tests and test preparation prices. 
White and Asian students, who are less likely to come from low-income families, perform better than Latinx and Black students on SAT and AP exams. One study found the mean score on the math section of the SAT is 511 out of 800; the average scores for Black and Latinx students were 428 and 457, respectively, while scores for white and Asian students were 534 and 598. When it comes to enrollment in AP classes, Black and Latinx students only account for 9% and 21% of students in these courses. 
The problem with standardized testing is that the rich abuse the system and can afford to spend money to outcompete others. After all, research has shown that SAT scores often correlate with family income, parents’ education level and race. 
Despite the College Board’s classist framework, there is public trust in this tax-exempt monopoly. The College Board has committed to remaining nonpartisan and nondirective. It has allowed states, school districts and teachers to use a diverse scope of academic outlooks to work with the system. The federal government supports the College Board by endowing millions of dollars to them.
To stop the College Board from profiting off high schoolers’ educational efforts, universities and colleges themselves must change how they admit their students. 
As a substitute for standardized tests, universities should interview prospective students or ask them to submit videos of themselves. A solution for a school like USC is to consider the state’s 11th-grade assessment test, which has less of a varying impact on minority students. 
Schools in the United States could follow the example set by Finnish schools, which include no standardized tests that eliminate rankings and competition between students. Therefore, it is difficult for an organization to control students’ higher-learning readiness. 
States must opt out of SAT and AP exams. For example, California could withdraw from the College Board’s testing program. It could authorize the state’s board of education to produce its own SAT or AP-esque test consistent with the state’s educational goals if they deem a standardized test necessary. 
Once public and private colleges approve such an exam and more higher-learning institutions decline SAT and ACT exams, the market economy would turn against the College Board. As states create contracts with new companies to provide testing for their students, the College Board’s monopoly will begin to collapse.  
Universities must follow alternative routes to testing so that a single corrupt, exploitative entity does not measure high schoolers’ college readiness.
