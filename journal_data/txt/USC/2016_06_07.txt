For the past 22 years, the Entertainment Software Association has used the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, popularly known as E3, to showcase new products in the video game industry.
This year, E3 will return to the Los Angeles Convention Center from June 14-16. This time, however, fans will play a much bigger role.
Increased fan participation will be an important factor in this year’s expo. E3 is first and foremost a trade show, which means only credentialed media and exhibitors have access behind closed doors. Many fans have been disappointed that they cannot take part in the action through sampling games, talking to publishers and developers or watching gameplay. Fortunately, attendees at this year’s E3 can expect a substantial change.
Publishers will hold fan events that will allow the public to demo new games and walk away with some memorabilia. EA, known for their games Madden, Battlefield and FIFA, will be hosting its own public event. Moreover, athletes such as NFL running back Marshawn Lynch will also be present to join in on the fun.
Building off the idea of increased fan participation comes a wholly original event, E3 Live, for the fans designed by the ESA in conjunction with the annual trade show. E3 Live will be taking place at L.A. Live and Hewitt said this fan fest celebrates everything about video games. Most importantly, it will allow fans to have a taste of what media has been able to experience for years on end.
This year, tickets sold out in less than 10 hours. Hewitt’s response: “Remarkable.”
E3 is known for its marquee announcements, as they allow the public to get a glimpse of the video game industry’s future in the next two to three years. Dan Hewitt, who serves as the vice president of media relations and event management at the Entertainment Software Association said  fans should expect approximately 200 announcements and product reveals from industry leaders such as EA, Sony and Nintendo. In addition, more than 2,000 projects currently in progress will be on display on the show floor.
“The best part of E3 is the surprise,” Hewitt said.
While nothing has been announced officially, there have been many rumors surrounding the announcements that will take place at the 3-day event. For example, titles such as Dead Rising 4, a remastered version of Skyrim, and Injustice 2 have been a big buzz among members in the gaming community. Fans will be anticipating more details of announcements at the expo.
Virtual reality has recently become a popular topic. Headsets such as Oculus VR’s Oculus Rift and Sony’s Morpheus have drawn a lot of interest in both the gaming and entertainment industries. Fans can expect an increased focus on VR at the E3 Expo. Both Sony and Microsoft will heavily feature VR as a new way to play video games at the event with demos of developing games and products.

Los Angeles’ LGBTQ community plans to celebrate its colorful history with the L.A. PRIDE Music Festival & Parade this weekend in West Hollywood.
Christopher Street West, an L.A.-based nonprofit organization, has made efforts to ensure that the event will foster a strong sense of community among the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth through music and the arts.
The three-day festival boasts an impressive lineup of music artists across the industry. This year Carly Rae Jepsen, Krewella and Charli XCX will be performing as the main headline artists. However, the lineup of artists bears a special significance to CSW President Chris Classen.
“This is the first year we’ve had such a diverse lineup,” he said. “That may not seem revolutionary, but when you think about a gay event, we don’t often have R&B or hip-hop performers who are straight males performing, and I think that we have reached a level of acceptance and inclusion. We now have a lot of allies in the industry who are excited to perform for us.”
Among other attractions, L.A. PRIDE will also feature a wide array of programs, such as the art exhibit “Cruising,” which was curated by Nathaly Charria. “Cruising” will showcase the works of many popular LGBTQ artists.
Throughout the weekend, interactive art installations will be presented on festival grounds at West Hollywood Park. Such include a recreation of legendary 20th-century artist Tom of Finland’s home in Los Angeles. Local artist Van Jazmin will challenge the issue of gender roles and transgender identity through his sculptures. The works presented at this year’s festival aim to embrace the history and culture of L.A.’s LGBTQ community.
“The pieces refer to the history of our community, our ability to come together and our struggles as LGBT people,” Classen said. “A lot of the art pieces reflect the history of Los Angeles and the community in general, and the ways in which we’ve co-opted other cultures and made them our own.”
The grand marshal for this year’s festival is Jewel-Thais Williams, former owner of one of the most iconic black gay discos in the world. She has been a staple of the LGBTQ community for four decades, advocating for a wide range of issues concerning gay minorities and those suffering from HIV/AIDS.
Amidst the busy schedule of events is the 46th annual PRIDE Parade. The course will run through West Hollywood’s most vibrant street, Santa Monica Boulevard, from Crescent Heights Boulevard to Robertson Boulevard.
This year’s celebration, however, has riled up many members of Los Angeles’ LGBTQ community. Critics have accused CSW of altering a historic, commemorative event to market more toward millennials.
“When you just single out ‘music festival,’ I think people’s initial reaction was that this is no longer an LGBT event,” Classen said. “However, the event has never been more queer.”
Although the festival has received a large amount of backlash, Classen reassures that L.A. PRIDE this year will still remain an important cultural tradition of the gay community. He also said that it will be the “most inclusive event in the world.”
“When people come through the festival gates, what they can gain is a sense of inclusiveness and acceptance. Even though the LGBT community has come a long way in the past 10 years in terms of legislation and acceptance. It’s still not easy for people in Los Angeles, even, to be who they are. This is the one time a year when people all over the city can come together as one family and be who they want to be.”
The 46th annual L.A. PRIDE Music Festival & Parade will take place Friday to Sunday.

The extent that adolescents go to feel a sense of belonging is one that is explored in director Anna Rose Holmer’s newest film. THE FITS tells the story of an 11-year old girl tomboy, Toni, played by Royalty Hightower, who becomes inspired to join the Lionesses Dance Team at her local community center. Initially, she doesn’t fit in with the other girls because of her boyish ways, having never danced before and being a boxer. She joins the team anyway, and shortly after, the captain and many of the other girls experience mysterious, inexplicable fits of fainting, moaning and shaking. Yet somehow, these fits become widely accepted by the girls, acting as a rite of passage. This ultimately causes Toni to question the dance team and herself because she is frightened of “the fits,” but also wants to be like the other girls.
The film explores the psychological phenomenon and the conditions of mass hysteria among young girls. The girls in the film are dedicated and borderline obsessed with their dance team. Despite “the fits” that the girls experience, such as fainting, they decide to embrace the  strange condition as a rite of passage.  Toni is afraid to experience “the fits,” but feels that she must do so in order to fit in with the rest of her dance team.  While the fits may seem a little ridiculous at first, audiences can relate the themes easily to mental health, peer pressure and adolescence.
The cinematography of the film is astounding, with every shot enhancing the story and perspective of the characters. The audience understands Toni’s shy awkwardness through the character’s personality as she is new to the dance team and is constantly questioning it and “the fits”. The composition also helped to create a feeling of uneasiness and mystery when many of the girls have the fits, drawing focus to the emotions of the girls who have “the fits.”
Hightower shines in the film in her portrayal of Toni, showing how confusing adolescence really is. Throughout the film, Hightower creates a Toni that is likeable and naive, from her shy glances to her awkward dancing. Audiences are able to relate to the confusion and longing to be accepted, ultimately making the movie that much more remarkable.
Overall, THE FITS brings a fresh story to the screen, presenting deeper themes to the audience beyond just dancers having fits, but delving into ideas of obsessions, community and acceptance. Holmer does a tremendous job in portraying the struggle of youth, and through the careful shots, amazing acting and unique story, the film gives audiences something to think about.

Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders spoke at a concert and get-out-the-vote rally at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Saturday to encourage people to vote for him in the California Primary held on Tuesday.
The rally, which featured performances by Mark Foster of Foster the People, Ozomatli, Best Coast, Iration and Local Natives as well as speeches from director Josh Fox and actors Max Carver, Shailene Woodley, Susan Sarandon and Dick Van Dyke.
To begin his speech, Sanders addressed how crucial young voters have been thus far to the success of his grassroots campaign.
“One of the extraordinary things about this campaign is that in virtually every state we have competed in, in states we have won and in states we have lost, we have received the overwhelming percentage of votes from young people,” Sanders said.
Sanders’ speech covered a wide range of topics ranging from environmental issues to marijuana legalization to prison reform. Sanders also referenced issues of clean drinking water in California.
“I have been in communities here in California where thousands of people when they turn on their faucets can’t drink the water that’s coming out,” Sanders said. “Our job is to make sure that every home in America has clean drinking water and we’re going to do that whether the fossil fuel industry likes it or not.”
Student debt was also a major topic of Sanders’ speech, in which he asked why students are being punished with debt for going out and getting an education.
“How does it happen when [students] do exactly the right thing —they go out and get the best education that they can— why does it happen that students end up $30, $50, $70,000 in debt?” Sanders said.
Sanders closed his speech by calling on California to vote in order to send a message to the rest of the country.
“Our job is to have this great state, this state which is one of the most progressive in America, tell the world that you’re going to help lead us into the political revolution.” Sanders said.
Some USC students were present at the rally. Kris Nguyen, a rising sophomore majoring in business-cinematic arts, thought that the rally served as a fun, entertaining way for students to participate in the election.
“I thought it was an exciting  way to get involved in politics,” Nguyen said. “It’s fun to see what the hype was all about and see a presidential candidate,” Nguyen said.
The Associated Press declared Clinton the Democratic nominee Monday night, but Sanders supporters dispute that claim, saying that because Clinton’s delegate count includes unpledged superdelegates, the Democratic nominee cannot be officially declared until the Democratic National Convention in July.
The event was initially scheduled at the Greek Theatre, but Sanders claims that the venue was changed due to opposition from a local city councilman that supported Hillary, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times. Clinton, who visited USC in March, held a similar rally at the Greek Theatre on Monday. Although the event was not initially intended for the Coliseum, Nguyen said that if the event had been held at the Greek Theatre he probably would not have attended.
“But since it was in the backyard of USC, I thought it was kind of cool to see,” Nguyen said.

The University is preparing to introduce the incoming freshman class of 2020 at its first orientation June 9-10.
The orientation is the first of six that the University is planning on hosting for freshman. The others will take place June 23-24, June 29-30, July 7-8, July 12-13 and July 21-22. Transfer students will have one-day orientations on July 19, July 26 and July 29. International freshman will have their orientation Aug. 15-16.
Orientations will include lunches, tours from orientation advisors, a spirit rally, multiple social events and performances from the USC Trojan Marching Band.
Leo Zhao, a rising junior who is one of four student orientation coordinators, said that this year’s orientation will also have orientation advisors give presentations on student life and academics, a skit that will cover a range of campus issues and a follow-up conversation with incoming freshman discussing the topics discussed in the skit.
Zhao, who was an orientation advisor last year, said that this orientation will be more streamlined than in previous years and that the staff of orientation advisors are well prepared for this year’s freshman class.
“I think this year’s staff is definitely more diverse than previous years and they’re all very excited to do orientation,” Zhao said.
The admission rate for the incoming class was 16.5 percent, the lowest in the University’s history. 8,920 students were admitted from all 50 states and over 75 different countries out of 54,100 applicants.
Overall, 41 percent of incoming students are from California, and 13 percent of students are first generation college students. While the average unweighted high school GPA was 3.84, 31 percent of students enter USC with a high school GPA of 4.00, more than 50 percent of students enrolled in AP courses in high school and most incoming freshman rank in the top 10 percent of their high school’s graduating class.
“Coming to college, there is a period where you have to transition from the mentality of a high school student to a college student,” Zhao said. “I think orientation is very really critical in preparing [students] for college life and showing them the Trojan spirit.”

Five years after the measures were found to be illegal, the Los Angeles Police Department continued to enforce curfew provisions in gang injunctions that criminalized being outside at night for suspected gang members.
However, through the persistence of Christian Rodriguez and Alberto Cazarez, both formerly charged with violating the curfew, and their attorney Olu Orange, an assistant adjunct professor of political science at USC, the city of Los Angeles will now be forced to pay up to $30 million to assist thousands of people affected by unlawful curfew orders. This settlement is the result of a 2011 federal class-action lawsuit filed by Orange, contending that the LAPD had been willfully ignoring a California appeals court ruling that had declared the curfews “unconstitutionally vague” four years prior.
“Gang injunctions, in how they’re drafted and implemented in Los Angeles and in the cities that follow Los Angeles’ lead, are all designed to infringe upon very basic fundamental, constitutionally protected freedoms — the freedom to associate, the freedom to speak or express oneself, the freedom to move and travel freely,” Orange said. “I also believe that they are a tool that law enforcement uses with unfettered discretion to engage in very lazy and inaccurate police work.”
The settlement, which is pending approval by a federal court judge, will primarily be used to fund job training and apprenticeship programs for the roughly 5,600 people included in the lawsuit, as well as tattoo removal for those seeking to leave gangs. Additional funds will also be paid toward the education of the daughters of the two plaintiffs.
Orange, who is also a civil rights lawyer and a panel attorney for the Indigent Criminal Defense Program, originally became involved with the case after being appointed as Rodriguez’s attorney. Rodriguez was arrested in 2009 for violating curfew. Though he has no ties to any gang, he was included in the injunction because of his brother’s gang connections and Cazarez was arrested for associating with him. As a juvenile, Cazarez was released, but it wasn’t until 2011 that Orange succeeded in getting charges dropped against Rodriguez.
After that experience, Rodriguez and Cazarez wanted to ensure that the city could not continue to enforce curfews against anyone, Orange said.
To assist him in gathering evidence for the class-action lawsuit, Orange credited the support of his then-intern, MiRi Song ‘09, as well as six then-Dornsife undergraduates, Sarah Ayad ‘12, Mitchell Diesko ‘15, Min Ji Gal ‘13, Lauren Ige ‘12, Angel Lopez ‘12 and Arpine Sardaryan ‘12.
Together, Orange and Song determined that more gang injunctions than just the one in Rodriguez’s case contained unconstitutional language. She helped review the terminology of all the gang injunctions in L.A. to figure out which ones could be challenged using the 2007 ruling. His students then analyzed tens of thousands of pages of police reports to determine the plaintiffs who should be included in the lawsuit.
Gal, who graduated from the Gould School of Law this year, reflected on what this case taught her about societal change through the legal system.
“Justice is slow. This case started in 2011 — that’s when I first started — and I’ve seen it progress, since it’s gotten class-action certification, since it went through different stages. One of the named plaintiffs [Cazarez] passed away,” Gal said. “It’s a very long process, and sometimes it might be too slow, but in the end, the system works. So you can have confidence in that.”
Orange too found significance in the case, hoping it would both discourage unconstitutional tactics concerning gang injunctions as well as prove beneficial through the funded job training and apprenticeship programs.
“Folks actually want to live good lives, and I hope this case provides an opportunity for that,” Orange said.
The amount that the city will pay — at minimum $4.5 million — depends on the number of people who will claim benefits. All of the plaintiffs so far have been enthusiastic about the program, Orange said.
“The uniform response is, ‘If this case had yielded thousands of dollars for me, I would spend it and it would be gone,” he said. “But this case gives me an opportunity to actually gain job training, create a job history, engage in education that will support a career, giving us an opportunity to change our lives for the better, and that’s far more important than some sum of money.”
As for the lesson he hopes this case will teach his students about the law, Orange cited a quote by prominent civil rights lawyer, Charles Houston, to describe the role of lawyers in creating societal change.
“‘A lawyer is either a social engineer or a parasite on society,’” Orange said. “You have a responsibility to make society better for people.”
This is a classic case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  Clearly there are some problems with the way the curfew laws were drafted, and it is shameful that people who were not specifically in gangs were caught up in these gang injunctions… But this successful effort to eliminate these laws entirely is almost as shameful.  Gangs are nothing short of a cancer on society.  They serve no good.  Rather, they serve to corrupt, destroy, demean, intimidate and kill.  Their behaviour is criminal.  Their influence is pervasive, and extends even to those who may not specifically be members of a gang, but associate with gang members and gang culture in a variety of nefarious ways.  Though I am not familiar with the specifics of this case, nor the individuals arrested under the curfew laws, let’s not pretend that they are all automatically “innocent” simply because they were not gang members.  Again, the cancer of gang influence and activity has weaved itself into many aspects of our culture.
A final note:  We often criticize juries for decisions we feel are wrong, but don’t assume that decisions by judges are any better.  Judges are and should be held to a very high standard, but they are human, and subject to the same biases as anyone else.  Let’s not forget that federal judge who years ago decided that illegal immigrants should nevertheless be entitled to in-state tuition rates… Or the California Supreme Court justices who decided an illegal immigrant who “otherwise” had satisfied all bar requirements should be entitled to practice law (of all things) in California.  These two examples should be enough to spark nothing short of outrage among Californians, but for those needing more, there is the current case of a northern California judge who sentenced an ex-Stanford student to only 6 months in jail following his conviction for rape.
So again, the judges who found the gang injunction and curfew laws to be “constitutionally vague” should be questioned in the first place.  I’m not entirely sure what the answer is here, but surely there is a way to achieve justice for plaintiff’s who were incorrectly arrested under these laws without completely destroying laws that are a critical component in our important effort to shut down gangs.

Dr. Verna Dauterive, a long-time USC trustee, adjunct associate professor, donor and student will be remembered for her tireless efforts to improve education and its accessibility for African-Americans.
Dauterive passed away June 1 at the age of 93, and her name is recognized by many in the USC community as the namesake and donor for the $30 million Dr. Verna and Peter Dauterive Hall. Opened in 2014, it now stands as USC’s first interdisciplinary social sciences building.
But her mark on the University and the greater area began long before.
Dauterive worked for the Los Angeles Unified School District for 60 years, and when she was hired, she was the youngest teacher and one of just four African-American teachers in the Los Angeles district. In 1982, she became principal of Franklin Avenue Elementary School in Los Feliz, a post she would hold for 23 years.
In 1975, Dauterive played a major role in founding the USC Black Alumni Association, with husband Peter Dauterive acting as the organization’s first donor.
“She’s been able to do quite a bit in shaping opportunity for underrepresented students here at USC,” said Michèle G. Turner, the BAA executive director.
Born in 1922 in LeCompte, Louisiana, Dauterive received her bachelor’s degree from Texas Wiley College. After taking many weekend and night classes at USC, she received multiple degrees in education from the Rossier School of Education, including a master’s degree in 1949 and a doctorate in 1966.
Turner emphasized how Verna and Peter Dauterive created the Black Alumni Association because they felt there was a lack of student scholarships for minority students at USC.
“They used their own social capital to create awareness about that,” Turner said. “The first scholarships that were made available from the Black Alumni Association were largely done because of their own social network. Dr. Dauterive used that heavily to encourage other people to support underrepresented students here at USC.”
In 1985, the University endowed the Dr. Verna B. Dauterive and Peter W. Dauterive Scholarship as USC’s first scholarship for minority doctoral students in education. That same year, Dauterive was named an adjunct associate professor at Rossier.
“She made a mark on public education — first as a teacher and then as an administrator,” said Rossier Dean Karen Symms Gallagher.
Gallagher praised Dauterive for recognizing the importance of offering scholarships at the doctoral level.
“She recognized you have to reach a hand out to help the next generation,” Gallagher said. “She always stepped up and got things done.”
In 1995, Rossier recognized her with the Recognition of Outstanding Support for Education. Turner said that Dauterive was deeply admired by those who worked with her within the Los Angeles community.
“She has always been about people understanding each other better across culture, across races, across nations,” Turner said. “Her work touched across all boundaries. She was not someone limited by race, ever.”
In 2005, after a career spanning six decades, Dauterive retired. Three years later she was appointed as an honorary trustee for the Board of Trustees. She soon announced her $30 million gift to create the Dr. Verna and Peter Dauterive Hall in memory of her husband. It was the  largest gift ever made by an African-American to a major institution of higher learning, according to the Los Angeles Sentinel.
Throughout her career, Dauterive supported the USC educational community by serving on the Board of Councilors at Rossier. She attended many USC related events, and founded the first alumni group, EDUCAR. Dauterive chaired the state’s Commission on Teacher Credentialing, appointed by the state’s Governor, as well as chaired the Commission on the Status of Women.
Dauterive also served on the board of the USC Alumni Association and was twice commended with its Alumni Service Award. In 2013, she received USC’s Presidential Medallion, the University’s top honor, which praises those who have brought distinction and honor to the University.
The Dauterives supported many programs and schools within USC. They made contributions to the Marshall School of Business, the Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, the School of Dramatic Arts, the Price School of Public Policy, and USC Libraries.
In a 2014 Los Angeles Sentinel interview, Dauterive talked about how she sought to create more opportunities for all students with an impassioned approach.
“The great American dream, in my opinion, can be achieved and will be achieved only when all races of people, White and non-White, will approach this problem cooperatively, on the basis of mutual understanding, respect for human rights, and consideration for the dignity of the individual,” Dauterive said.

Football season never sleeps for USC and with a new season on the horizon, a new team will step onto the field in the Coliseum for the first time. According to 24-7 Sports, USC landed the eighth strongest recruiting class of 2016. USC signed two five-star recruits, 12 four-star recruits and six three-star recruits. There are a few freshman in particular who are expected to not only compete for starting spots, but also make significant contributions to the team as soon as the season begins.
Five-star recruit Oluwole Betiku is a local of Gardena. The Junipero Serra graduate is coming into a defensive line that needs immediate improvement, and Betiku is expected to help.
With the Pac-12’s overall depth at the quarterback position, USC’s pass rush was a large focus for head coach Clay Helton and defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast during the recruiting season.
“In our league, a passing league, you have to be able to get to the quarterback and Wole has been able to do that in his career,” Helton said in his national signing day press conference. “If I were quarterbacks in our league right now, I’d be scared. He scares me just walking up. He looks like he’s about 26 years old.”
Betiku is one of seven freshmen who enrolled at USC a semester early in order to participate in spring practice.
Another defensive end who has the build to compete immediately is 6’7”, 250-pound Connor Murphy. Murphy was the top-rated defensive end in Arizona.
“We really felt that these men were elite about putting pressure when we evaluated on film,” Helton said. “Getting to the quarterback is something we dearly needed.”
Joining Betiku and Murphy on the defensive side of the ball is five-star athlete Jack Jones. Jones has characteristics reminiscent of current cornerback, wide receiver and kick returner Adoree’ Jackson.
“He is the most dynamic athlete. He reminds you of several guys that have been here before. We’ve got this guy named Adoree’ Jackson that does a great job for us,” Helton said. “He is in that similar mode of being able to not only play defensive back, but being greedy on offense too. You love to be able to put him over there and have the chance to be able to throw him a ball or two. He’s so dynamic with the ball in his hands and as a returner. Just the ultimate weapon.”
On the offensive side, the recruiting class is highlighted by offensive tackle Nathan Smith and wide receiver Josh Imatorbhebhe.
Smith and the offensive line will be the root of the Trojan offense.
“Not only are they big men, but they can move,” Helton said of the 6’7” Smith. “We do a lot of zone schemes and pulling with our run schemes. Each one of these guys are ultra athletic. It’s kind of been a staple for us here at USC.”
Josh Imatorbhebhe joins his brother and fellow wide receiver redshirt freshman Daniel Imatorbhebhe as part of an increasingly deep receiving corps.
“I think sometimes as a head football coach and a staff you have to look not only for the season coming up, but you also have to see what’s going on in the future and with the dynamic of us possibly losing several young man after this season and how special a group this class was, we really felt that we needed to load up,” Helton said.
The Imatorbhebhe brothers as well as the other freshman will be leaned upon heavily as the season continues. Helton is a proponent of playing the best available player, and if these freshmen impress him and his coaching staff, they won’t hold back from putting freshmen on the field.

The Trojan’s women’s basketball team will be adding some serious firepower this year in their freshman class. After last year’s 19-13 season, which was riddled with suspensions, the team looks to reload and refocus on a new year.
One of the largest assets for the team as it looks ahead will be incoming freshman Valerie Higgins. A 6-foot-one wing player with a 98 percent grade scouting report from ESPN, Higgins was looked at by scouts from high-caliber programs like the University of Louisville, the University of Texas, Oregon State and West Virginia before selecting USC. And this summer, she’s landed yet another accomplishment to prove the depth, experience and talent that she will provide to the Trojans roster — a spot on the USA Under-18 National Team.
Higgins received the call-up to play in the red, white and blue on May 31, when the national team released its Under-18 roster for the 2016 FIBA Americas U-18 Championships in Chile this July. The call-up came after a weekend spent in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where Higgins was invited to compete alongside 30 other young hopefuls for a spot on the roster.
The invitation to try out was a testament enough to the incoming freshman’s promise. But the call-up set Higgins apart. As one of only two new players added to the roster this summer, Higgins will join 11 other players to represent the top elite players in America. U-18 players go on to play in the WNBA and the Olympics, and typically stud the starting rosters of powerhouse programs. Past rosters boast names such as Baylor’s Brittney Griner and the University of Connecticut’s Breanna Stewart. This year, Higgins will be adding her name to the list.
“It means the world, honestly,” Higgins said. “Coming out here to the trials, even getting invited is such an honor, and now making the team is even a bigger honor. All the girls that made it are so deserving and it’s just an exciting opportunity.”
And she will start her career with the U-18 team during an important summer for the American team. The FIBA Americas championships, which take place in Chile this summer, determine the top teams on the North and South American continents. Competition is always fierce, particularly because it determines who can compete in the FIBA world championships, which serve as the world cup for international basketball.
Higgins will return to Colorado Springs from July 2 to July 8, spending Independence Day training to represent her country. She will then leave with the team to compete in Chile from July 13 to 17, where they hope to take home yet another U-18 gold medal.
This recent accomplishment is only one of many accolades that make Higgins a valuable addition to the Trojans’ roster this year. A graduate of the Chaminade College Preparatory School in Los Angeles, California, Higgins was on the Naismith Watch List for the majority of her scouting time in high school.
Reports by ESPN regard her as a “complete perimeter performer,” describing Higgins’ role as a versatile and unique. Higgins boasts a dangerous outside shot and is considered one of the most versatile small forwards of her class. But her main strengths comes in transition offense and in her ability to handle and pass the ball.
Described often as “unselfish,” Higgins creates a threat due to her high percentage from the arc. Yet she’ll choose to dish to an open teammate just as often as she’ll drive to the hoop, which stretches defenses to their limits and creates just as many opportunities for fellow players. Her ESPN scouting report after the Nike Nationals last year declared her a “coveted glue-player that raises the bar for her teammates.”
For the Trojans, it means a whole new jolt of energy to an offense that lost critical momentum last year after the suspension of then-junior Jordan Adams and then-senior Brianna Barrett due to academic ineligibilities. Although Barrett, an explosive guard, graduated last year, Adams will return to the team to fill the guard position and provide expertise at the helm of the offense.
In turn, this will create relief for senior Courtney Jaco, who was formerly the key shooting guard for the team. Similar to Higgins, Jaco can deliver from behind the arc while also creating options for her teammates through assists. Last year’s ineligibilities, however, forced Jaco to take on the role of the point guard, a position she had never filled before. This meant that the then-junior shouldered a leadership position for the team, changing the way she handled the ball and fit into the offense.
Jaco rose to the occasion, coming alive as a leader at point, but it meant that she had less opportunities to heat up from 3-point range and to contribute points to the team. With Adams back in the rotation and Higgins’ shooting stretching the defense, Jaco will be in the perfect position to use last year’s experience to lead her team into creating a well-oiled machine of an offense.
And Higgins isn’t the only addition to this year’s roster. Last week, the team also added transfer Ivana Jakubcova. The 6-foot-6 center will be the tallest player in USC women’s basketball history since WNBA star and gold medalist Monica Lamb played for the Trojans in 1987. Jakubcova will have big shoes to fill in the place of graduate transfer center Temi Fagbenle, who led the Trojans in almost every statistic last year and notched 10 double-doubles on the season.
The addition of Jakubcova, who played at Murray State and Kentucky before suffering an injury, will add depth to the team in the coming year. As the new school year nears, the team has all of the pieces put together. Now, it’s up to head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke to get them working in time for the season’s tip off in November.

The first time I heard of Muhammad Ali was when I watched a black-and-white clip of him celebrating his 1964 heavyweight title after upsetting Sonny Liston.
“I’m king of the world!” he yelled repeatedly, ignoring the interviewer’s questions. “I’m king of the world! I’m a bad man.”
The first thought that popped into my head was why this man thought he had the right to be this arrogant. But as I grew older, I slowly learned the full context and placed that clip in perspective with his life as not only the greatest boxer who ever lived, but as one of the greatest human beings who ever lived. Ali was one of those rare athletes who transcended sports and became a global icon, instantly recognizable and idolized even by those who did not care for boxing.
Unfortunately, I was far too young to witness his prime years firsthand. The Ali I grew up with was the one riddled with Parkinsonism, his body shaking uncontrollably, a shell of its former self. But the Ali that will live forever lies in old YouTube videos, in documentaries and in stories passed down by those who knew him. And in the days following his death, watching and reading many of these accounts makes it easy to comprehend the giant imprint this man left on the world.
It started with his charisma. Ali was a skilled, up-and-coming fighter in the early ‘60s, but he was more than that. He was a black star athlete, and one of the rare few — white or black— to speak his mind. He taunted his opponents. He was extremely articulate. He was a trash-talker before the term “trash-talking” was even invented.
Before his bout with Liston, Ali went on a talk show and called Liston a “big ugly bear.”
“That fella’s too ugly to be the world champ,” he said. “ The world champ should be pretty, like me.”
He then predicted he would beat Liston in eight rounds. It only took him seven, by a technical knockout.
“He wanted to go to heaven, so I took him in seven,” Ali said after the fight.
His boxing record backed up his words. He won 56 fights and lost just five. The way he danced and pranced around the ring — a way of sizing up and intimidating his opponents — became known as the “Ali shuffle.” Two of his bouts — the “Rumble in the Jungle” against George Foreman in 1974 and the “Thrilla in Manila” against Joe Frazier in 1975 — will be glorified and remembered forever for their hype and intensity. The “Rope-a-Dope” strategy that he employed against Foreman to take back the heavyweight title was the stuff of legend, intentionally leaning back against the ropes, allowing Foreman to tire himself out with harmless punches and finally knocking out an exhausted Foreman in the eighth round.
The documentary “When We Were Kings” tells the story of that fight beautifully, with behind-the-scenes footage of Ali mocking and taunting Foreman in the weeks leading up to the fight so incisively that you’d think it was an actor playing Ali. But it was him — so authentic, so raw and so distinctive.
Many athletes, especially today, show a certain personality on the field and are completely different off of it. What made Ali stand out as more than just a boxer was that he never wavered from his true self. He converted to Islam shortly after defeating Liston, and changed his name from Cassius Clay — which he called a “slave name” — to Muhammad Ali, in additional to joining the radical group Nation of Islam under much criticism and condemnation. When an opponent named Ernie Terrell refused to refer to Ali by his new name prior to a fight in 1967, Ali responded in the ring, punching Terrell repeatedly while yelling, “What’s my name?”
Shortly afterwards, when he was drafted to fight in the Vietnam War, Ali refused.
“I ain’t got no quarrel with them Viet Cong,” he said, those words now immortalized. He believed so adamantly that he shouldn’t have to fight for Uncle Sam while people of color in the United States were still “treated like dogs” that he gave up three years of his prime boxing career while his titles were stripped and his boxing licenses taken away.
At the time, his decisions outside the ring were highly reprimanded. Many in mainstream America hated it and considered him a traitor. He was too radical even for Martin Luther King Jr.
“Cassius should spend more time proving his boxing skill and do less talking,” the reverend said.
Today, Ali has gone from being universally loathed to universally loved, and we look back and wish he could have talked even more. The height of his career coincided with both the civil rights era and the Vietnam War, and as a black superstar, his actions — standing up for his religion and beliefs, not backing down from any fight, even with the government — transformed him from an athlete to an icon.
Ali won’t be remembered as a traitor or a victim of Parkinsonism; rather, he will be remembered as the right man at the right time to come along and shake up the world for the better.
So, to the well deserved “king of the world,” keep floating, keep stinging and keep rumblin’.

For the last 104 years, USC has been the only university to have at least one athlete compete in summer Olympics and bring home gold every time. This long-lasting record hopefully won’t be broken in Rio. Current and former Trojans are ready to battle in the “Marvelous City” to get on top of the podium.
The men’s volleyball team will try to repeat the gold medal of Beijing and stop Brazil’s attempt to win in what are the first Games to ever be held in South America. Playing in pool A, together with Italy, Brazil and France, head coach John Speraw will have two Trojans in his Olympic team: setter Micah Christenson and opposite Murphy Troy.
Christenson graduated in 2015 with a degree in human biology and was part of the squad that lost in the NCAA final in 2012 at home against UC Irvine. In the summer of 2013, after his sophomore year, he debuted with the U.S. National Team at the North, Central America and Caribbean Volleyball Confederation championship. A native of Honolulu, Hawaii, his career was already successful in college. He won a gold medal at the World League finals in Florence, Italy, and a year later he helped Team USA qualify for the Olympics as they won the Men’s World Cup in Japan where he was named Best Setter. He started to play professional volleyball last season in Italy for Cucine Lube Banca Marche Civitanova. Despite finishing first in the regular season, his team fell short in the semifinals of the postseason.
Troy graduated in 2011 with a physics degree. He was named AVCA Player of the Year in 2011 and led the Trojans to two NCAA Tournaments in 2009 and 2011, though neither resulted in a championship. He was part of the squad that won the gold medal at the FIVB World Cup in Japan. He started to play professional volleyball in Italy for Top Volley Latina, before moving to France and then Poland, where he won the Polish Cup and Polish SuperCup with Lotos Trefl Gdask. He will leave the Polish club next season but his next destination is still unknown.
On the women’s side, the team coached by Karch Kiraly will try to bring home the first gold of the program after two silver medals in London and Beijing, falling short to Brazil both times. Another former Trojan will be playing in Rio in the different-colored jersey of the libero.
Natalie Hagglund graduated in 2014 with a degree in communication. A three-time All-American, she holds the school record for digs. With the U.S. National Team, she won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Toronto last summer and finished third at the FIVB World Cup in Japan. She currently plays professional volleyball for Volero Zurich. Her team won both the national title and national cup in 2015.
The beach of Copacabana will host the beach volleyball tournament. The women’s side will have a Trojan trying to maintain the winning streak for the US that started in 2004.
April Ross graduated in 2005 majoring in international marketing. She was part of the indoor team that was back-to-back national champions in 2002 and 2003 — the last titles won by USC women’s volleyball. After graduation she pursued her professional career in Puerto Rico playing indoor before transferring to the sand. In 2007 she was named FIVB Rookie of the Year and AVP Most Improved Player. In 2007 she started her partnership with another Trojan, Jennifer Kessy, and one year later they were crowned FIVB World Champions in Stavanger, Norway. In London, at the last Olympics, they lost in the final to Kerri Walsh-Jennings and Misty May-Treanor, who get their third consecutive Olympic gold. Ross will be playing alongside Walsh-Jennings. They already qualified for the Games and they’re third in the rankings, just behind the two Brazilian pairs. This year they entered six main draws of FIVB international events and finished on the podium in each of them, getting four titles in Rio, Fuzhou, Cincinnati and Moscow; a second place in Vitoria and a third place in Xiamen.
Aquatic events will also give the Trojans plenty of opportunities to bring home a gold. The big one everybody will be watching is Katinka Hosszu. After graduating in 2012 with a psychology degree, the Hungarian swimmer first represented her country in Athens when she was only 15. Despite many attempts and world records broken, she has yet to win an Olympic medal, after finishing fourth in the 400m medley in London. Her nickname is “Iron Lady” due to her skills in all the different styles. She holds multiple world records and has already won five gold medals at the World Championships.
Santo Condorelli will be a senior next year, majoring in business. He will compete for the Canadian team. Condorelli finished fourth in the 100m at the past World Championships in Kazan and got bronze in the 4×100 free mixed relay. He is a four-time All-American.

Following the tragic events on the UCLA campus last Tuesday, in which a former student murdered a professor and ended his own life, the public erupted into the usual gun control debate almost instantaneously. As many pro-gun commentators have pointed out — the UCLA shooting took place in a gun-free zone, in a gun-averse city, in a gun-allergic state. Gun supporters have long decried the double-edged sword of such restrictions, as in the case of Mainak Sarkar, who brought two semiautomatic weapons and multiple magazines onto UCLA’s campus while students and faculty were restricted from carrying weapons which could potentially be used in self-defense.
Yet, it is widely believed that gun bans have their rightful place on college campuses, and the alternative options, such as arming students and faculty or increasing gun visibility, are not the way forward. Resources would be much better utilized being funneled into mental health outreach and improving campus climates to avoid students from harming themselves and others. It is true that banning guns from a campus will not necessarily prevent people from committing mass shootings or murder, and the assumption that gun-free zones are the catch-all remedy for potential killings is flawed. Most gun control advocates know this. Gun-free zones can not purport to remove every vestige of danger from an area, but that is because they are a preventative measure — to avoid an environment in which guns are a commonality. Let’s not forget that a university is an institution of learning, and according to a YouGov poll, 63 percent of citizens don’t want any kind of firearms presence on private college campuses. By implementing a campuswide ban on arms, we must remember that this cannot necessarily prevent stray shooters, but instead avoids easy accessibility to guns and reduces the amount of gun-related activity at universities.
But as we’ve seen repeatedly in high-visibility campus shootings, the gun-free method alone does not have the kind of effect we need. Gun-free zones can keep out casual gun culture, but they can not contain the vengeful school mass shooter. The most disturbing shootings — those of Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook and Columbine — took place in gun-free zones, highlighting the shortcomings of the concept.
Furthermore, these restrictions draws the ire of gun owners across the United States who believe gun-free zones restrict students’ self-defense, despite the lack of support for this perspective from actual students. Around 13 million Americans are licensed to carry a concealed weapon, the large majority of whom are responsible, well-intentioned owners. Yet a sizeable number of these people believe they have been unfairly targeted by gun-free zones — as if their suggestion that a good guy pegging shots at a bad guy is not only a brilliant idea, but a God-given right. If this were the case, and guns actually saved more lives than they endangered in mass shooting situations, there would be no discussion to be had. If the endgame for most gun control advocates is to curb the unnecessary deaths of innocent people, theoretically the idea of self-defense gun usage should be appealing.
In the 2015 Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon, Christopher Harper-Mercer, a 26-year-old student, shot nine people in his English class with legally purchased weapons. This took place on a campus that was not a gun-free zone due to the 1989 statewide law that forbids any public body from restricting the rights of concealed carry-permitted gun owners. Students and faculty were legally allowed to carry on campus, and in fact, one Umpqua student, John Parker Jr., a 36-year-old army veteran, was carrying his firearm during the shooting. Parker and others refused to intervene over the fear of possibly being mistaken by law enforcement.
“Luckily, we made the choice not to get involved,” he told MSNBC days after the shooting. “We were quite a distance away from the actual building where it was happening, which could have opened us up to being potential targets ourselves. And, you know, not knowing where SWAT was on their response time, they wouldn’t know who we were, and if we had our guns ready to shoot, they could think we were the bad guys.”
Not only is the disorienting and unpredictable nature of a gunfight underestimated by self-defense gun proponents, but FBI data released in 2014 also suggests that “good guy with a gun” incidents simply do not occur often enough to be legitimate. Between 2000 and 2013, only five of the 160 mass shootings that took place in the United States were halted by an armed citizen, and only one of those five had no prior law enforcement training. Over a 13-year span with a death toll of 1,043 victims, only one average citizen was able to end a mass shooting with their personal firearm.
The “good guy with a gun” trope is a fallacy. It is not realistic to expect college students, some of whom are 18 years old and have just flown the coop, to have proper tactical firearms training. Some college-aged students don’t even know how to work a washing machine properly, never mind navigate a potential hostage situation with multiple shooters armed to the hilt with semi-automatic weapons. We can’t simply arm our students and have faith that 10 hours worth of shot practice will aid in the transformative process from mere college student into the second American Sniper.
Freshmen keeping handguns in their dorm drawers and professors stocking ammunition next to their lecture notes? If this doesn’t sound absolutely ludicrous, then at least the required amount of regulation and on-campus training seems like an ungodly amount of tuition dollars.
It’s about time to wake up from the vigilante pipe dream and focus on preventing our peers from falling through the cracks. Gun lovers are right — troubled people with an intent to kill will find anything to harm others, whether that be kitchen knives or baseball bats. It just happens to be that guns are the most effective tools of death available. We should redirect the argument and the resources to fund and expand mental health networks and to sustain a community that doesn’t allow the most vulnerable students to gain access to weapons. Yet, when it comes to nonviolent solutions, scarcely a word is heard from gun supporters. Prevention is better than cure, but that is especially true when the cure means tactical firearm training for college students.
If someone is prepared to come on campus with the intent to commit murder, why would a gun ban stop them?  They are going to commit a capital crime.
I don’t like the idea of gun free zones.  I think individuals should always have the option of taking steps to defend themselves.  However, if we are going to have gun free zones than we have a responsibility to those inside them to do it right.  
Any time you take away an individual’s capacity to exercise their right of self-defense, you assume the responsibility for that person’s safety.  This requires taking measures to ensure that no one can bring a gun in, and emplacing the necessary measures to ensure that no one can force their way in.  For schools this means a security fence with manned checkpoint and sufficient guards to hold off an attack until reinforcements can arrive.  While this may be possible for a school or a concert hall, it isn’t possible for an entire country.
Some will, no doubt, make the claim that self-defense in situations like what happened recently is not possible.  Setting aside the fact that the people making this claim usually lack any sort of tactical or self-defense training, and setting aside the fact that expert after expert will testify that that claim is false, here are some things to think about:  
1)  Even if the chances are slim, a slim chance is better than no chance at all.
2)  Even if there is no chance, there is value in dying on your feet, resisting the will of evil men.  If you are cornered and going to die anyway, would you rather spend you last moments fighting to survive or crouching in fear hoping for rescue?  Each person has to answer that question on their own, but to take away someone’s choice for them is wrong.
3)  Even an ineffective resistance may slow an attacker down.  “Holy smokes!” thinks the madman, “that guy shot at me!  Maybe I need to approach the next corner with caution and creep past that door instead of running.”  A slower attacker means fewer dead.
4)  There is benefit in creating uncertainty in the minds of madmen.  Are there going to be armed citizens at the location of the attack?  Are they going to be able to mount an effective resistance?  Asking and answering these questions will slow down, perhaps even deter an attack.  It will certainly make them more cautious, and a cautious attacker moves more slowly and finds fewer targets.
Some people will say “I don’t want to live in a world where we have to think about these things”.  Well, we live in a world where these kinds of things are reality, whether you want to or not.  You may not want to think about these things, but some of us are willing and able to do so.  If you are unwilling or unable to take steps to protect yourself that is your choice, but you have no right to make the choice for someone else.
What a load of crap.
Gun owners are always the first to speak up about preventive measures before violence happens, getting NICS records up to date, making mental health treatment more available, identifying those who are troubled early on… WE are the ones who have been doing that for YEARS.
You know the 2 reasons mass shootings don’t get stopped by people legally carrying a personal firearm? Because 1. These law abiding citizens don’t bring guns into gun free zones and 2. When a shooter is stopped by a legal concealed carrier, they’re almost always stopped BEFORE the body count reaches 4, which is the magic number for the shooting to be considered a “mass shooting”. Those who wish to need to be allowed to carry wherever they go, nobody on our side is telling anybody they have to carry a gun if they don’t want to.
You know what’s seriously lacking in this article? An alternative solution. Don’t tell us we have no ideas, which is a proven false claim, when you have none of your own.
“Yet, when it comes to nonviolent solutions, scarcely a word is heard from gun supporters.”
You aren’t looking hard enough, gun groups are beginning to invest time and resources into suicide prevention as a first step to address the mental health issue. I would post the link but Disqus won’t let me.
Suicides are by far the most common form of gun-death in the US, frequently cited by people who agree with you as “gun violence.”  I generally consider suicide is a generally non-violent activity; while it causes emotional pain, there are too many effective methods available to blame the guns.  Even so, no one can deny that there is a strong tie between mass murder and self-destruction.  I would venture a guess that this is part of the gun community’s motivation to address suicide as an issue.
It is very likely that your FBI mass shooting prevention statistics are missing some data, but I am open to read your source if you cite it.  My best guess is that the FBI statistics only account for mass shootings that are “mass shootings” when they are stopped by a “good guy.”  I can think of two would-be “mass shootings” that were stopped by a bystander before they qualified as “mass shootings,” and that’s just off the top of my head.  I was paying close attention around the time of Sandy Hook (full disclosure, I needed to research to find the reference links but not to think of the events):
Dec. 11, 2012 – Clackamas, OR; again, Disqus will not let me post the link…
Dec. 16, 2012 – San Antonio, TX; again, Disqus will not let me post the link…
These are only two events, but their dates are so close together that your “Between 2000 and 2013, only five of the 160 mass shooting” claim is likely an extremely narrow reading of the numbers.
I generally agree that more resources should be applied to mental health, this would do wonders at preventing a violent minority mentally ill (note: violent tendencies are unusual among the mentally ill) population from murdering in GFZ’s.  It seems reasonable that at the same time, the Universities should take some precautions if they are to remain gun free.  Court houses often use armed guards to keep unexpected people from killing witnesses and prosecutors; it should be reasonable that universities follow suit. 1-3 PROFESSIONAL armed guards working in conjunction with 5-10 security volunteers with radios would likely make most would-be mass shooters think twice about visiting a college/university campus.
It should be noted that most victims of a mass shooting within the “Golden State” can expect to be left for dead, in most cases.  CCW’s are unlikely to step in because helping with a firearm in California is a good way to get sued, convicted of some obscure crime, and scorned out of most respectable career options within the state.
Gun control and “gun-free” zones is one of the few areas where failure provokes a call for even more of the same.
“Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”
– Albert Einstein
Failure? California campuses are over 30 times safer than the state as a whole. They are the safest places most students and staff will ever spend time:
Homicide rate, state of California: 5.7
Homicide rate, California gun-free campuses: 0.17
(average incidents/100,000  2005-2014  FBI, USDofEd)
BTW, are you using that Einstein quote over and over again, expecting to be any smarter?
Sure, universities have low homicide rates… but if you look at the education level of persons convicted of illegal homicide (20-30% of homicides are justifiable), you will find that the vast majority of those convicted (not necessarily guilty) are not college educated.
Having something to lose can be a powerful reason not to commit crimes, especially homicide and college students typically have something to lose.
Maybe guns would cause more homicide on campuses, but maybe not.  Considering CCW legalization patterns in recent history…  you can study the stats and make up your own mind.
According to the FBI, there were 287 justifiable homicides by a citizen, 233 by a citizen with a firearm, on average 2010-2014. There were 14,573 criminal homicides on average during that same period. So fewer than 2% of homicides are justifiable, not “20-30%” as you assert. 
The most thorough analysis to date of Right To Carry laws shows they are associated with measurable increases in some crime, notably gun-aggravated assault. Even the original “more guns less crime” methodology shows this when applied to a large enough data set. Here’s a good overview with links: Right-to-carry laws: Revisiting the link between guns and violent crime / Journalist’s Resource.
As to the effects of guns on campuses and school grounds, the record of licensed concealed carriers is dismal. There have been 0 reported defensive uses, 1 suicide, 6 criminal homicides, and about 8 negligent discharges among this group, on campuses and school grounds. And yes, I can name and date each instance. The most egregious was the murder of 3 nursing professors at University of Arizona by a nursing student who also took his own life (Robert S Flores, Jr.).
I take your point about the justifiable homicide number being too high.  I guess I thought that the police shoot way more people… thank heavens it’s not the 90’s anymore.
If your criminal homicide number is meant to imply firearms, it is really high.  We could get into the whole, self defense vs murder weapon of choice debate… bet let’s not.  It gets really confusing when a rope is a perfectly adequate murder weapon and a useless self defense weapon.
Narrowing to firearms specifically, firearm homicides are roughly 8,500 per year.  In that 8,500 number are 200+ justifiable homicides by citizens and 300+ justifiable homicides by police… Also, there are about 800 or so accidental deaths with firearms, which is extremely sad because they are so preventable.  I take little solace in my demographic that swimming pools, while far less common than guns, kill quite a few more people; I wish accidental firearm deaths were 0.  This falls into your 8 negligent discharge category.
500 justified / 7,200 criminal, which is roughly 7% of intentional firearm homicides defensive.  We’re both off by a similar multiple: you’re 3.5 times too low, I’m 3.5 times too high.
How many students are there on school grounds that allow firearms?  Those numbers seem extremely low… especially for suicide, since my roomate’s friend killed herself with a plastic bag and one of my friends slit his wrists with razor blades on campus during my freshman year (fortunately, he lived).  If firearms were permitted on campuses, I would expect a higher percentage of suicides to homicides… by approximately 3-to-1.
I will alter my comment above to reference 7%.
Yeah, no. I cited FBI homicide numbers which means by definition “murder and non-negligent manslaughter”. The USDofEd Clery data numbers are also for “murder and non-negligent manslaughter” with no breakdown given by weapon. If you add in justifiable homicides by law enforcement, it’s at most (428 + 287) / 14,573 = 4.9% on average, 2010-2014. 
You missed by an order of magnitude. I demand that you commit Seppuku, and post the video before you bleed out.
This information as to which weapon used in crimes is clearly broken down in FBI Expanded homicide table #8.  So, again, you are wrong about your 14,573 number.  I concede the point of the 800 accidental deaths per year, I misinterpreted the definition… still, the number is over 6.5% justifiable homicides… or 7% if we’re rounding.
I just noticed that you posted information about a Stanford study about RTC in your previous comment… did you edit that in?  The article itself describes a “broken” peer review process; the process is broken because it does not happen.  It is important to note that in that article, a substantial amount of data manipulation was needed to make the trend line go up.  Since there are only so many states in the US, the sample size was less than 50, which in my view is pretty small to draw strong conclusions from… not to say that the Stanford study is wrong… there just is not enough information in that article to make a judgement one way or another.
You still have not addressed my question about demographics as related to your original comment.  Refresher: college students are more highly educated than the majority of murderers.
You still have not addressed my concern about sample size in your “dismal” record of carry on campus.
Your math was off by the same order of magnitude.
By suggesting that I commit Seppuku and show you my violent death, I assume that you are trying to get a rise out of me because you want to distract from the fact that you have left major points unaddressed.  Even so, you might want to get talk to someone if you are truly that bloodthirsty…
I, for one, want to see as many people as possible live to a ripe age and enjoy the company of their loved ones.  Orlando is a tragedy and my heart goes out to the victims and their families.
Ha ha … so you’re comparing places like Oakland and East LA to a location where there are only highly paid professionals and kids who are spending tens of thousands of dollars each year just to be there?
Talk about your apples and oranges. … Sheesh! Could you be more ridiculous?!
If you want to compare something, try comparing the homicide rates of gun-free campuses to non-gun-free campuses. Or at least learn some of the basics of the social sciences, such as the well-known fact that murder rates (and crime rates in general) trend strongly with socioeconomic status.
So no reason to worry about concealed carry on campus?
according to a YouGov poll, 63 percent of citizens don’t want any kind of firearms presence on private college campuses.
I am surprised it is only 63 percent. Most people dont want any kind of firearms on campus…but some bad guys WILL carry on campus. The question is what do you do to stop that.
Wait a second, because a concealed carrier in an active shooting made the right choice NOT to get involved you think that means ‘gun free zones” are a good idea?  You might want to do a logic test first.
Not having been at the scene at the time his decision was made, and not knowing if individual who had a legal concealed weapon
 became aware of the active shooter before or after law enforcement and the swat team arrived at the scene, it is really impossible to evaluate his decision to not get involved. Personally I have become involved when something happened within my view at the time of the incident and I judged, correctly I believe, that I could make a difference by becoming involved. In this case I was able to prevent what would have been a home invasion, assault and possible rape, fortunately without having to fire a weapon.  I should add that as a former firearms instructor, it is much harder to teach “when not to shoot” than when to shoot.”
Well, the proper person to explain when not to shoot is a defense attorney, not a firearms instructor.
He or she will tell you, in no uncertain terms, that the only time to shoot is when you believe that you can convince twelve people (and remember that these are twelve people who are not smart enough to get out of jury duty) that you genuinely felt that you were in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury.
In other words, don’t go running toward the danger. That’s the cops’ job.
I support qualified people being able to carry,  but I would never hold it against a concealed carrier for NOT using his gun.  No matter what training you have, people just do not know how they will react in such a situation. There is a lot of hard wiring for either fight/flight/freeze.
I have to agree that the veteran in Oregon made the correct decision to not get involved. I say this as a combat veteran and concealed carry permit holder in my home state. I also want to point out that in most states, including California, one cannot get a concealed carry permit unless one is 21 years of age or older.  This means that most undergrads could not legally carry a concealed firearm even if concealed carry was allowed on campus.  I would suggest that current law enforcement officers, be allowed to carry on campus when off duty. Some campuses and departments allow this others do not. All campus police should be properly trained in law enforcement firearm use and be armed.  At present many campus police nationwide are not armed or properly trained, and have little or no capability to adequately respond to an armed shooter situation. Colleges and universities should also consider allowing properly trained former military combat veterans and professors with adequate firearms experience to carry concealed on campus and become in effect “auxiliary police”.  This could have the effect of improving response capability in the case of a armed shooter situation and save lives.
The universities don’t have the money to do this. They’re spending it all on new fitness centers and deans of “diversity and inclusiveness” and other such nonsense.
In other words, today’s modern university looks like a Gold’s Gym with a highly paid nitwit whose only responsibility is to write several reports a year about why not enough black people are going to the gym.
You make no sense.  Because one person made the proper decision to not go across campus and take on an active shooter you believe that shows there should be no one allowed to exercise their rights on campus?  He’s not a cop, he carries for his own protection.  He was not actively threatened.  He made the correct decision.  I’m betting you either have never read about or are choosing to ignore the times when someone with a CCW did made a difference.
You expect anything less? Journalists have no clue what they’re talking about 99% of the time, gun rights and armed self defense are a subject they even take pride in knowing absolutely nothing about.
“…Resources would be much better utilized being funneled into mental health outreach and improving campus climates to avoid students from harming themselves and others. ”
What resources? If you remove the stupid ‘gun-free-zone’ signs it doesn’t take any resources other than the screwedriver needed to uninstall the signs. 
When you allow adults who have already passed the background check to purchase their firearm to carry their firearm, there is no cost to you or the school for that. I can carry my firearm, the teachers can carry their firearms if they choose, and any other adult can do the same. How does that take resources away from mental health outreach and improving campus climates to avoid students from harming themselves or others?
