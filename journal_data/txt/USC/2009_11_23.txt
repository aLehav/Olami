A new resolution from the Undergraduate Student Government aims to increase the size of USC’s Sustainability Office and allocate more resources to sustainable efforts on campus.
The resolution, up for a vote at USG’s Senate today, seeks to expand the scope of environmentally friendly efforts at USC, according to John Baldo, USG’s director of university affairs.
“The resolution expresses the student body’s support for expanding USC’s Sustainability Program and asks the university to allocate more resources,” Baldo said.
According to USG President Holden Slusher, who presented the details of the resolution to the Board of Trustees earlier this month, the resolution arose from a need to make sustainability a more prominent and pressing issue on campus.
“We feel that it’s time that we had a visible office and made [sustainability] part of campus culture,” Slusher said.
USC is already implementing a number of
environment-friendly measures, including holding the Sustainability Steering Committee, a forum for students and administrators to discuss sustainability efforts.
But, the resolution claims, attendance at the committee has been lacking, and it also adds that on-campus environmentally friendly organizations do not have sufficient meeting space and that USC’s sustainability grade report has remain unchanged for the past three years.
“While the creation of the Steering Committee and establishing our [sustainability] program was a huge first step … it’s important that USC expand on that progress and continue to develop its program,” Baldo said.
He added that the resolution also attempts to address the lack of staffing at the Sustainability Office, which currently has just one full-time employee.
“The office is being flooded with ideas for projects and requests to be involved,” Baldo said. “The program does not have the capacity to coordinate all of these projects and capitalize on all the opportunities.”
As a result, the resolution recommends the inclusion of more full-time staff for the Office of Sustainability, and demands more office space to address student interest in improving USC’s environment.
“We would like to see the staff of the sustainability program expanded to include people who can coordinate student projects on a full-time basis,” Baldo said. “We have also proposed the idea of creating a fund, which would allow students to submit project proposals to improve campus sustainability and receive funding if selected.”
Baldo acknowledged that USC has made substantial efforts in making university operations more sustainable, through composting leftover food in the dining halls, providing a transportation fleet with diverse fuel sources, using hybrid vehicles and planning a LEED-certified building.
“But we’re lacking a large community element where students can become involved through their daily
lifestyle, on-campus activities and research through their classes,” Baldo said.
USG representatives have been in talks with the administrators to add to the university’s sustainability efforts, including a possible community garden, a refillable mug program for beverages and course credit for sustainability research in some classes.
Matthew Oden, USC’s sustainability program manager, said he appreciates USG’s effort to expand the program.
“The interactions our office has had with USG leaders in other contexts and projects has shown them the value of the Office of Sustainability and they have identified that we are currently under-capitalized and under-staffed,” Oden said.
Although the resolution, if passed, doesn’t require the administration to implement its recommendations, it displays a level of student interest in the success of the program.
“It clearly shows that sustainability is a critical and important issue to the student body and articulates that they want to see the university put more energy and resources into this area,” Oden said.
Leaders of campus sustainability organizations also feel the passage of the resolution will expand their efforts at USC.
“It would be a major step saying that USC is dedicated to becoming a sustainable campus,” said Yvette Ferrer, the chair of the California Public Interest Research Group at USC. “Having an office would allow student groups to come together and offer legitimacy to proposals made to USC administration for how to green our campus.”
Some students said they feel increasing the scope of the office is a step in the right direction for USC.
“It’s a good idea … USC definitely is lacking in sustainability practices and it needs to be addressed,” said Bri Baker, a junior majoring in communication and human development and aging. “If this office plans on making sustainability more well-known and practiced, and is done well … I support it.”
To pass, the resolution will need a simple majority from Senators at USG’s Senate meeting today.

For as long as Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs Gene Bickers can remember, USC has held classes on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving — often causing headaches for students and professors alike.
Many professors cancel classes that Wednesday, while others hold class only to see a sorely lacking student attendance as students often must decide between going to class and traveling home for the holiday. Still, the university continues to hold classes the day before Thanksgiving, though it has begun to consider making a change.
“The question has certainly been raised,” Bickers said. “But we’re still trying to figure out if it is to the university’s advantage if we have a short week before Thanksgiving.”
Hung Wong, a professor of engineering, said he is still holding class on Wednesday, but he has told his students the class will not affect their grade in any way.
“I’m paid to teach,” Wong said. “I don’t want to be lazy and not hold class … But attendance will not be required — it won’t be on any quizzes or homework assignments, so if they don’t show up, it’s as if it never happened.”
Based on past years, Hung estimated that, at most, half his students will be in class.
“Typically the Wednesday before Thanksgiving has very sparse attendance,” he said.
But other professors are not so forgiving if students miss class because of travel plans or for any other reason.
Derek DeCaro, a freshman majoring in psychology, said his Spanish professor is giving a quiz Wednesday and has told students they will not be allowed to make up the quiz at another time.
“I would go home on Tuesday, but I have to stay another day,” DeCaro said. “For people that need to travel and book airplanes, it’s kind of a pain. I think the university is absolutely ignoring the fact that people need to travel. One day is not enough time.”
Another professor, who wished to remain anonymous, said he is canceling class in anticipation of low attendance, knowing that many students leave Wednesday regardless of their class schedule.
“I’m not going to hold a class when only 15 of my 200 students will be there,” he said. “But the university’s policy is that we have classes on Wednesday.”
The professor asked to remain anonymous because he was concerned his decision to cancel class would get him in trouble with his school’s dean.
Lindsay Portnuff, a senior majoring in economics, said all her professors canceled classes on Wednesday this year.
“I don’t think it makes sense to have classes on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving,” Portnuff said. “All my teachers canceled it this year, anyway. But in past years, when I have had classes, maybe 20 percent of the class comes. I don’t think there’s a point.”
Portnuff said being able to leave before Wednesday has saved her money.
“It’s so expensive to go home Wednesday night,” she said. “It’s much cheaper to fly home Tuesday or Monday night. I’m leaving [Monday] and it’s half the cost of going home [Tuesday].”
According to a recent poll conducted by the Undergraduate Student Government, most students share Portnuff’s views — 93.2 percent of students who completed the survey said they want Wednesday off.
Though the idea is only being discussed hypothetically right now, USG Director of Academic Affairs Andrew Matson, who is in charge of the poll, said he does think the university should re-evaluate its calendar.
“The schedule doesn’t allow students to travel home as it should,” Matson said. “I do think the academic calendar hasn’t changed with the times as the university has been evolving. We are no longer a commuter school. We are a national and international school and I think our calendar needs to change to reflect that fact.”
Maybe we should not have classes a week before Thanksgiving?  My family lives overseas and it takes me nearly 48 hours to get home not including the donkey ride to the cabin.  I need time to pack and decompress before I leave for home.  Maybe I need two weeks.    Hey “a Mom”, do you date younger guys?   Sounds like you could really cook something up….
Hi somewhat disagree with you guys,
I was a graduate student last spring and in grad school some of the classes are weekly ( 3hrs) and they have an extensive course material which is very difficult to cover in an entire semester. In that situation if the class falls on the day before thanksgiving, we cannot afford to miss it.
The Cal State system- even before all the budget cuts and furlow days- has had a tradition of the entire week off of school for thanksgiving. AND MANY OF THOSE SCHOOL ARE COMMUTER SCHOOLS.  It’s not fair to students who have 50% of their professors cancel class in the morning, but are forced to attend a 4-6 night  class on Wednesday night. there needs to be consistency.
I agree with what “a Mom” said.
The “tradition” of holding classes the Wednesday before Thanksgiving probably posed no hardship in the days when almost all of USC’s students were from California, with a few from other western states.  Now, however, as USC touts its geographic diversity, it doesn’t make sense to strand those from more than a couple of hundred miles away and deny them a chance to be with their families.
This is a “tradition” that should be sacked.
USC is a national university with students from across the United States.  The current academic calendar does not allow all students to be home for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Holding classes on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving creates a hardship for some families.  It is quite difficult (and at times, impossible) to make affordable travel plans with the current USC calendar.  I believe that USC should adjust the academic calendar to provide a longer Thanksgiving break for their students.  Many universities leave this week free for travel and celebration.  It’s time to rethink the calendar!

On Thursday, after campus has cleared out, the handful of students left on campus will find they have more options than usual for Thanksgiving dinner.
USC Hospitality, University Residential Student Community, the Office of International Services and the Trojan Knights have all arranged events for students who find themselves stuck on campus for the holiday.

“Lots of students go away with friends who live locally,” said Lynette Merriman, senior associate dean for USC Student Affairs. “But for those who choose to stay behind, we do have opportunities for Thanksgiving dinner.”
Though students in previous years have complained about the lack of dining options on Thanksgiving week, Merriman said there will be plenty of opportunities for students to get a good meal this year.
The school-sponsored options include dinners at Parkside Dining Hall and Everybody’s Kitchen, and a match-up program for international students to eat dinner with American families, Merriman said. Many residential faculty will also host full Thanksgiving dinners Tuesday night.
Mercedes Antonich, an EVK
employee who has worked at the Thanksgiving dinner, said the dining hall tries to create a welcoming experience for students. She said creating that family experience is worth the extra time spent at EVK.
“It’s so nice, I never minded it because we close at 7:30 p.m. and then go home and eat with our own family,” she said.
EVK is expecting about 70 students to attend its Thanksgiving dinner.
International students will also have the chance to have a more intimate experience for Thanksgiving dinner.
The Office of International Services
offers an annual Thanksgiving match-up program, which pairs students with local host families to create a cross-cultural experience. About 80 students participate in the program each year, according to OIS.
Waleed Ishtiaq, an international student from Pakistan and a freshman majoring in engineering, said he was unsure whether he will celebrate Thanksgiving, but the international student group invited him to join a family.
“A lot of people have invited me, so I might as well go,” Ishtiaq said. “I guess it’s better than staying here alone.”
This year, the Trojan Knights will host a new Thanksgiving dinner in front of Tommy Trojan, since Thanksgiving falls in the middle of its annual Save Tommy Week.
Mark Wynohradnyk, a Trojan Knight and a sophomore majoring in business administration and cinematic arts, said he’s glad to be spending Thanksgiving on campus if it means serving the USC community.
“I’m all the way from the East Coast, so I’m definitely excited to be doing this on Thanksgiving,” Wynohradnyk said. “Protecting Tommy Trojan comes first — if that means not seeing my family, that’s what I’ll do.”
The Knights’ dinner costs $25 per person, and they are expecting about 50 people to attend.

Harvey Keitel is the original bad lieutenant.
He is a New York police detective who is addicted to heroin, has a gambling problem and even forces female suspects to mimic sexual acts as he watches and masturbates.
Life of sin · In Werner Herzog’s Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, Nicolas Cage puts his own zany and erratic take on Harvey Keitel’s original drug-addicted bad cop from the 1992 film Bad Lieutenant. - Photos courtesy of First Look Studios
Director Abel Ferrara’s 1992 film, Bad Lieutenant, introduced audiences to the worst police officer imaginable, and it was thought then that nothing could top Keitel’s performance.
But now someone worse is competing.
Werner Herzog’s new film, Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, also has a bad lieutenant, but this time it is Nicolas Cage as he brings ruthlessness to a whole new level.
Herzog’s film is not a remake, even though both films share the same name and feature a similar drug-addicted rogue police officer who does more harm than good. What separates the two films enormously is that each respective lieutenant is an example of an opposite  emotional extreme and is portrayed with his own ferocity that convinces the audience to either sympathize or laugh along with him.
Ferrara’s bad lieutenant is breaking apart. His sporadic moments of isolated intensity fuel his rage and his multiple vices to the point that everything spirals out of control. He is a desperate man who turns to drugs and extremely deviant sexual acts to counter his ongoing desperation, which becomes the focus of the film.
Watching Keitel take heroin and then disrupt his own high with another uncontrollable act of panic is gut-wrenching to witness, and because of scenes like this — and there are more than a few  — the original Bad Lieutenant has been classified by many as a dangerous film.
Dangerous it certainly is, but at the same time it has a very redeeming quality about it. The bad lieutenant is on a quest for redemption. Because he learns he cannot redeem himself, he instead chooses to redeem a criminal who is just as perverse as himself.
After all the sick and lecherous acts he commits throughout the film, he does achieve redemption, even if he does not live to enjoy it.
And as moral as that is, the original’s ending is what inevitably makes it succumb to the brutal force of Cage in Herzog’s film and ultimately establishes Keitel as a more sympathetic protagonist than a blatantly deviant.
Cage is energetic. His drug addiction fuels his erratic personality and, though it does appear comical, underneasth the comedy is blatant amorality. Instead of the drug-related and offensive sexual adventures filled with despair and the overall sense of ragged isolation that Keitel conveys, Cage is vibrant with energy.
He is a clown on coke with a .44 Magnum stuffed in his pants, but somehow he keeps getting promoted. Cage fills his nostrils with garbage and then walks into a room filled with other detectives, where the first thing he notices is that there are two iguanas on the table and that they are staring right at him.
“What the fuck are these iguanas doing on my coffee table?” he asks everyone. The iguanas might not be there for everyone else who is not on drugs, but, for Cage, they are his reality.
The drugs, violence and unlimited power that society continues to give Cage’s character are all part of his ongoing circus that is never affected by the despair that Keitel’s lieutenant is plagued with. While Keitel is looking for redemption, Cage is looking for the next high, and that is what makes him dangerous.
Ferrara’s film is depressing while Herzog’s film is fun. As an audience member, you do not pity Cage as you would Keitel. Instead, you want him to shake down a young couple for drugs and then laugh out loud as you watch him smoke a crack pipe and proceed to have his way with the female suspect while he makes her boyfriend watch.
The momentum that is fueling Cage’s character is explicitly shared with the audience to the point where you want to join along. He literally seduces the audience into joining in on all the fun he is having, because that is what it is for his character: fun.
Ferrara’s film is certainly commendable and should not be overshadowed by Herzog’s, but in regard to who is the worst “bad lieutenant,” the answer would undoubtedly be Cage. As an audience we know how horrible he is yet we still want him to win.
Cage’s performance allows the audience to feel good about being so bad. He is the real evil because he makes it look so cool. It is hard not to speak along with his character when he proclaims, “I love it. I just love it!”
Because after all, we love it just as much as he does.

No matter how bad your day is going, the Internet will always be there for you. Whether you need the new download from your favorite music blog or the comfort of a social network to prove you still have friends, the web has got your back. As long as your wireless network is working, you know you can count on it.
You probably use the Internet daily, for the purpose of everything from communication to various forms of entertainment. How can you not? The Internet has slowly but surely taken over, and to ration our online time now seems impossible.
From inside this digital bubble, it’s hard to imagine that not everyone is as linked in as you are. Yes, 88 percent Americans consider themselves Internet users, and that is an overwhelming majority for such a new piece of technology. Other parts of the world, however, have not been as inclined — only 6.8 percent of the entire continent of Africa uses the Internet.
If you can’t imagine that, you’re not alone. Because we tech-savvy folks consider the time before the Internet as ancient, we’ve done a lot to put ourselves in others’ shoes. Focus groups have been conducted where participants are forced to give up the Internet while lab technicians watch them struggle with class work and communication.
Participants have claimed that giving up their Internet access has made them do more activities that would traditionally be thought of as good and healthy, such as exercising or working on crossword puzzles. Unfortunately, the logic exercise that is a crossword puzzle seemed needlessly difficult once the element of Google was extracted.
Once we check our facts online, we never want to go back, but at least we are realistic about what it has done to us.
One of my favorite party questions is, “For a year, would you rather give up the Internet or have no sex?” Answers usually depend on the type of party, but more often than not peers will compare their ratio of getting some to checking their email and choose the former.
College students in Europe would probably stick with the latter (and not just because their fellow citizens are foxy foreigners). Based on an August 2009 survey in the UK’s Telegraph, one-third of people in the European Union have never used the Internet. This statistic is shocking because we don’t consider Europe to be as behind on the times as a place like Africa, where the addition of technology is usually fiscally impossible.
Interestingly enough, if Europe decides to go digital, they could solve many of the area’s financial problems — they are looking at an untapped job market, and digital products and services could be the answer.
Bearing this in mind, we can see that the Internet offers so much more than search engines and online games. It has spawned a workforce and provided countless new opportunities for entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, the direst of economies are not always capable of increasing their cash flow with Internet related investments. Africa has very low bandwidth, and, because of this, Internet access is slow, crowded and generally limited.
But this does not mean the continent will stay that way — Africa has demonstrated a great affinity for communication. 3G networks exist even in rural areas, and many external countries are hard at work on fiber optics techniques to help the continent get connected.
Internet prevalence could change everything for Africa. It could revolutionize education, making information accessible to anyone who sought it and spreading the knowledge to local pupils. It would solve a number of health care issues, such as educating the population on AIDS and other diseases and allowing patients access to doctors worldwide by webcam. But at the root of all this, an efficient Internet connection could do for Africa exactly what it does for us: help us communicate.
We likely don’t think of email as a luxury, but this Thanksgiving, let us recognize it. We are privileged to have access to Google, even if it encourages us to cheat at crosswords. We are lucky to have Blackboard, even if it is the new version that we can’t stand.
Let us give thanks for these 2009 technologies — our wireless networks may not always be reliable, but our ability to keep improving is.
Who knows what we’ll think of next.

There are three things I’ve come to expect from Thanksgiving: mediocre football, passing out early and inane traditions.
Holiday traditions are still fun, but many are of spotty origins. We do them because we’re instructed to do so, and the rituals derive their meaning strictly from history.
It’s fitting, then, that the annual battle for Los Angeles falls on Thanksgiving weekend.
As an outsider from Washington DC, I’ve always had a hard time grasping the USC-UCLA rivalry. Then again, the rivalry is probably misunderstood by most people outside of California. Ivan Maisel called the cross-town showdown the most overrated rivalry in all of college football in his book, The Maisel Report.
But this year I’m warming up to the rivalry.
It’s an odd time to suddenly embrace the game and its traditions. The 7 p.m. kickoff bucks the trend of afternoon games and makes for the series’ second-latest start time.
The timing means that the game will be ignored on the national landscape, but the setup would have relegated the matchup to being an afterthought, anyway. USC enters the game with its lowest ranking since the end of the 2001 season, and UCLA elicits no more than local attention despite its progress.
But the lowered expectations actually give the game more meaning. This time around, the game’s outcome will go a long way toward determining each program’s future.
The consequences are dire as always for the Trojans. But this year, a loss to the Bruins would turn the season from disappointing to disastrous.
Past games against the Bruins have always represented an opportunity to close out on a BCS bowl, but this year’s match is a salvage mission. With a logjam in the Pac-10 standings, a single slip-up could mean the difference between the Holiday Bowl and the Poinsettia Bowl.
But there’s a bigger storyline at play here and it’s all about the Bruins.
Even in a rebuilding year for USC, UCLA still isn’t close to taking over the throne of the city’s top football team. The Bruins scraped together enough wins to be bowl eligible but are seventh in the Pac-10 pecking order and still need to boost their résumé for the postseason.
Remarkable progress has undoubtedly taken place in the last year in Westwood, Calif. But to snap their five-game losing streak, the Bruins had to go Dumpster diving in the Pac-10 standings for wins against Washington, Washington State and Arizona State.
Then again, the Huskies took down the Trojans and the Sun Devils nearly did, so there’s little reason for USC to puff its chest out on that point.
For all of the talk of the monopoly being over, though, USC still holds most of the properties, houses and hotels on the playing board that is Los Angeles.
But UCLA is still closing the gap, and only in part because of the USC’s regression this season. The Bruins are slowly but surely building themselves up, and a win against USC would be the ultimate selling point for coach Rick Neuheisel’s program.
Neuheisel has already earned several key victories on the local recruiting trail, including wide receiver Randall Carroll and tight end Morrell Presley.
And though the talent disparity still exists, the Bruins have more than a handful of players who would see significant time for USC.
With all of the program traditions that have come to an end this year, a loss to UCLA might be the breaking point for many Trojan followers. Many USC fans might be seeing red, but the last thing they would be able to stand would be seeing the Victory Bell painted blue.
USC coach Pete Carroll rarely gives meaning to anything beyond the game’s outcome, but these subplots don’t have to apply within his team to carry weight. Fans need storylines to stay engaged in a season that has been less than fulfilling. Otherwise, they make a beeline for the exit when the game turns sour like it did against Stanford.
Gunning for a bowl that takes place before New Year’s Day may seem foreign to USC fans, but all traditions are tenuous and can come to an end. It’s why the Trojans can’t take their tradition of dominance against the Bruins for granted.
If they do, the spirit around Heritage Hall will be decidedly less thankful on Sunday than it will be on Thursday.

Sometime last night or this morning the bruin bear was painted cardinal and gold.  It was a beautiful sight to see.
Not all Trojan fans are equal in my book.  We have an enormous number of fair-weather fans who supported the program the past several years because of our success.  The minute we start losing, you see them leave the Coliseum in droves during the 3rd quarter to “beat the traffic.”  And booing the team?  I can’t tell you how disgusting that is.  Then there are the true fans that support the team through winning AND losing seasons.  Anybody remember Ted Tollner and Paul Hackett?  Sure, it’s great to have our Trojans in the hunt for national championships, but when they’re not should they be booed for making mistakes on the field???  I say good riddance to all the bandwagon “fans.”  Go root for the Colts.  I hear they are having a terrific season.
Is that not fair? If your grades slip, your professor doesn’t look at you the same way.
I don’t stick around the thin.
FIGHT ON! BEAT THE bRUINS!

By the time USC and UCLA kick off their annual rivalry game this weekend, two weeks will have elapsed since the team’s worst loss in the Pete Carroll era, a time span that allowed much needed rest for a weary Trojan team.
The 55-21 loss to Stanford in the Coliseum exposed weaknesses in the Trojan attack, and, following the ugly loss, the urgency for injured players to return to action increased.

The 14-day break will afford the Trojans an opportunity to do just that.
For a struggling USC offense, the return of redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams is of the utmost importance. Although Williams has yet to return to full practice, he did participate in a few tests of his injured ankle during Monday’s practice, and USC coach Pete Carroll remains confident in the redshirt junior’s ability to return from the injury.
“[Damian] is the kind of guy who will find a way to play,” Carroll said. “Veterans find a way to make it, and he’s going to try in a way to try to adapt to what he’s got.”
Junior defensive end Everson Griffen has also returned to 100 percent, according to Carroll. For Griffen, the team’s sack leader, to return to full strength is important for a Trojan defense that was burned for 469 yards against the Cardinal.
“We just have to bounce back and prepare well. If you get it done on the practice field you can get it done during the game,” Griffen said after practice on Monday.
The Trojans will be looking to respond in a big way against UCLA as they try to get their eighth win next Saturday, but the Bruins aren’t going to roll over. After losing five straight games in the middle of the season, the Bruins have won three straight and are bowl eligible for the first time since 2007.
Last week against Arizona State, the Bruins were able to force six Sun Devil turnovers, two of which were returned for touchdowns.
“They’re playing good consistent football and their defense is solid,” Carroll said. “They’ve been able to get turnovers and kept scores low all season long.”
UCLA’s offensive attack has been a surprising recent strength for the team as well, with multi-threat quarterback Kevin Prince leading an offense that’s averaging 30 points per game during its recent winning streak.
“Kevin is a really good football player and obviously effective,” Carroll said of the talented freshman. “He makes good throws and can run well.”
For Carroll and his coaching staff, preparing for a much-improved Pac-10 conference, including the rejuvenated Bruins, has been a challenge every week.
“There are a lot of good teams in our conference this year. It’s the best it’s been since I’ve been here,” Carroll said.
Thankfully for Carroll and the Trojans, these extra days were also an opportunity to prepare for the Bruins.
“We’re way ahead of where we usually are this time of the week on UCLA,” Carroll said.
The Trojans will face the Bruins under the lights of the Coliseum at 7 p.m. on Saturday.

After capping a 22-1 season and an undefeated record in conference play with a win over UC Irvine on Saturday, the No. 1 Trojans are staying in the comfort of their own home as they enter the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament with the top seed.
The Trojans will ride a 39-game home winning streak, as well as a 15-game overall winning streak, into McDonald’s Swim Stadium, when they face the No. 8 seed (yet to be determined) on Friday.

USC’s winning streaks were challenged over the last month with difficult matches against UC Santa Barbara, UCLA, Stanford and Irvine, but, behind strong defensive attacks and a couple of key plays, the Trojans were able to maintain their perfect conference record.
For the seniors who have led the Trojans throughout the season, this tournament marks the last time they will compete in a conference event. Since 2006, the first year the group was together, USC has gone 96-6, winning one NCAA tournament (2008) and placing second in two others (2006 and 2007). The Trojans also won the MPSF tournament the last two years.
Last year, the Trojans fared well in the MPSF tournament, beating Irvine and UCLA to advance to the championship match against Pepperdine. In the title match, senior two-meter Shea Buckner scored on a buzzer-beater to put USC up 3-2, lifting the Trojans to a 27-0 record and a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Championships, which they eventually swept as well.
The Trojans will finish their postseason with the NCAA tournament, which takes place a week after the MPSF tournament.

The USC men’s basketball team has been undermanned at best through its first two contests this season, but reinforcements are on their way.
The Trojans will play host to Coppin State this Friday with the added help of redshirt senior forward Marcus Johnson and redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson.
The return of Stepheson and Johnson is all the more important considering redshirt junior forward Kasey Cunningham’s torn ACL, which will force him to miss the entire regular season.
Johnson and Stepheson both missed the season-opening win over UC Riverside and the subsequent loss to Loyola Marymount. USC (1-1) was forced to rely on only seven players in the two games, blowing a 12-point lead in the second half and falling 67-59 against LMU.
But beginning this weekend, first-year coach Kevin O’Neill will have added weapons at his disposal in Johnson and Stepheson.
Johnson, a 6-foot-6, 210-pound forward, sat out the first two games per an NCAA punishment because of an exhibition game he played in with Connecticut in 2007. The Westchester High product transferred to USC after two seasons with UConn and played 16 games last season with the Trojans.
Stepheson practiced with USC all of last year but didn’t play because of NCAA transfer rules. The 6-foot-9, 235-pounder transferred from North Carolina after his sophomore season to be closer to his family, which was dealing with several health concerns.
Coppin State, coached by the legendary Ron “Fang” Mitchell, boasts a roster led by guards Lenny Young and Kareem Brown. Young is averaging a team-leading 14.7 points per game this season while Brown leads the team in minutes played with more than 29 per game.
Mitchell recorded his 600th win as a head coach at the college level with the Eagles’ victory over West Virginia Tech earlier this month. Coppin State (3-1) is traditionally a Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference power.
Unbelievable that another torn ACL happens to the same player. Something amiss when two women players and one men’s player keep getting the same injury year to year. Wonder if any other collegiate basketball programs at one school has experienced this kind of situation in the past few years.

Riding a four-match winning streak, the No. 15 USC women’s volleyball team looks to close out its season on a strong note this weekend as it takes on Arizona State and No. 19 Arizona at the Galen Center.
USC (19-9, 8-8) defeated Arizona State on the road earlier this season behind a career outing by outside hitter Alex Jupiter. The sophomore tallied career highs of 31 kills and 20 digs against the Sun Devils (13-15, 3-13), as the Women of Troy won their first road conference match of the season.
USC will try to keep Sun Devils outside hitter Sarah Reaves in check. In the first meeting between the two teams, the junior led Arizona State with 20 kills and 10 digs. Reaves leads the Sun Devils with 433 kills (4.37 kills per set).
The Arizona Wildcats have been much more successful than their rivals this year.
They posted an impressive victory over then-No. 11 Cal last weekend. The Wildcats (19-8, 8-8) are looking to end their season on a high note against UCLA and USC before heading into the NCAA tournament.
The Wildcats defeated USC 3-1 earlier this season when the Women of Troy combined for an uncharacteristic 25 errors in the contest. Arizona’s outside hitter Tiffany Owens ignited her team with 16 kills and 13 digs in the match. The junior leads the Wildcats with 330 kills (3.67 kps) this season.
Despite some midseason struggles, USC coach Mick Haley believes his team is peaking at the right time and is ready to finish the season streaking.
The action starts on Friday at 3 p.m., when USC takes on Arizona State and continues Saturday at 2 p.m. as the Women of Troy end their regular season against Arizona.

Before his team’s last game, USC women’s basketball coach Michael Cooper said he liked the toughness his players had demonstrated early in the season.
“I’m liking our intensity level as far as coming out and playing hard,” Cooper said.  “I like our resilience for being able to bounce back after we take some good hits from people.”
Finding their way · Coach Michael Cooper and the USC women’s basketball team has lost two of their first three games to open the season, but the new head coach is happy with the intensity level the team has shown. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (1-2) will need to bounce back in a big way over the holiday break after turning in a disappointing performance against Gonzaga.  USC shot less than 30 percent from the field in a 70-58 loss that was not as close as the final score indicated.
The high-scoring Bulldogs score nearly 90 points per game and have won their first four games by an average of 40 points.
USC gets a chance to rebound at the Pearl Jam Tournament in the US Virgin Islands, where it will take on a trio of highly ranked teams in round-robin action.
First up on the docket for the Women of Troy is a Thanksgiving Day game against Rutgers, which sits just outside the top 25 in the AP poll.  After that, USC will take on No. 13 Texas before finishing against No. 19 Mississippi State.
If the Women of Troy want to have success in the tournament, they need to shore up another problem area — rebounding.  Cooper said last week that the team had struggled to come up with key rebounds.
“Rebounding is something that can be your Achilles heel,” he said.  “If you don’t take care of that, it can cause you big problems down the stretch.”
Against Gonzaga, the Women of Troy gave up 19 offensive rebounds and 15 second-chance points.

Did you know any student can find ratings of all of USC’s professors through the link “Course Evaluations” on your myUSC page? I didn’t.
Upon finding this link, it became apparent why I had never heard of this application before — these “evaluations” are meaningless numbers.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
OK, maybe these numbers aren’t exactly meaningless because students submitted them through end-of-the-semester evaluations, but they don’t say much. Sure, students know to avoid a professor with average ratings of one or two, and shoot for professors who score around four or five.
Most professors at USC rate an average of three or four, which means that very few of them manage to be ubiquitously deemed terrible by the student body. That doesn’t mean that every professor will fit every student just right, however; students don’t just want a professor with a good rating, they want a professor who will meet their educational needs.
Course evaluations at USC are a powerful resource for determining salaries and promotions. They determine how teachers can improve, and whether they merit new benefits from the administration.
The problem with getting accurate course evaluations is that students aren’t given the proper motivation to fill them out accurately — or at all. It’s fairly common to look up a course with a roster of more than 100 students to find that only 50-60 percent of the students completed the evaluations.
Students are busy, especially during finals season, and evaluations are typically passed out at the end of a class, when stamina is low and animosity high.
There is no doubt that evaluations are necessary, but, when they are impatiently and quickly completed, they provide little information to the administration.
A solution for students to get motivated to fill out course evaluations objectively and for professors to receive helpful comments is to make more comprehensive versions of the evaluations accessible to students. This way, students can feel that their opinions are heard by their peers who may be considering taking a course with a particular professor in the future.
In years past, there was an online forum called USCprofessors created by the USC Student Senate that allowed students to freely comment on their professors on several criteria. Students also had the option to view other students’ opinions on professors they were considering for the forthcoming semester.
This forum no longer exists, perhaps because the comments were unregulated and often biased. An alternative site, ratemyprofessors.com, acts as an erratic source for looking up professors with an equally unfiltered system of comments. What students seek by going to sites like USCprofessors and ratemyprofessors.com are indications of how well a professor will fit their learning style and educational goals; numbers alone cannot fully indicate those things, but neither can slipshod evaluations.
A more comprehensive course evaluation site for USC should include written comments in addition to numerical ratings. The fact that these evaluations go through both the administration and respective faculty will aid in regulating which comments get posted, both negative and positive.
The all-too-general questions like, “What are your instructor’s strengths?” and “What could your instructor improve on?” might merit more specific answers if students knew they would be heard among a larger audience than just their professors.
Posting relevant comments by students about an instructor’s strengths and weaknesses would create an effective system for students to gauge how well a prospective professor will meet their needs. If a professor uses highly detailed PowerPoint slides or is great at encouraging discussions, many students may opt for his or her class. Alternately, if a professor teaches in a style more lecture-based than class-discussion-based, students who enjoy participating in class may try looking for other professors more suited to their learning style.
It’s a terrible feeling going to that one class you thought you’d enjoy on that first day only to find out the professor puts you to sleep. Of course, many students take classes regardless of the professors teaching them, because they enjoy the subject or their major requires them to, but the ability to gauge a professor’s compatibility with individual learning styles is imperative to maximizing what one takes away from the class.
A more comprehensive system of course evaluations would grant students this ability, encourage more objective evaluations of future courses and even aid professors in tailoring their teaching abilities.
This comprehensive system will create a more synergistic relationship between students and faculty, where students can communicate their needs more efficiently and professors can try to meet those needs better.
Word-of-mouth comments about professors are overwhelmingly sparse: “He sucks,” “She’s funny,” “He’s boring.” A comprehensive evaluation site would allow students to walk away with a greater understanding of their potential teachers, not snarky one-liners.

“Students are busy, especially during finals season, and evaluations are typically passed out at the end of a class, when stamina is low and animosity high.”
I still don’t write negative reviews despite feeling this way.
I tried using the Course Guide website, and it’s a pain in the ass to use.  You have to enter the first and last name of the professor, term, dept, and course #.  I’m not sure how well the database is populated, but I searched for a bunch of professors and nothing came up for any of them…
I think there needs to be a unified system that is well publicized and maintained so that it has enough relevant data for students to use.
Ever heard of usg.usc.edu/courseguide? Get your facts straight. Thanks.
hahaha victor got served
I was extremely disappointed by the lack of research in this opinion piece this morning. USG hosts a website called Course Guide (right under the Course Evaluations link on myusc). This website allows students to post both numerical and written reviews, and review posts for the courses they are considering. The website REPLACED the old Student Senate website, which had out of date posts and frankly unhelpful reviews.
Written reviews of courses are accessible, use them.

Preparing to cross at the Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard intersection is like preparing for battle.
It would never do to simply wait for the white man to appear and jaunt casually to your destination.
It is a journey. You strategize on the best crossing method: straight across, or diagonal? An arced trajectory in between?
Are you biking? If so, is there a LAPD officer nearby who will give you a ticket if you don’t get off your bike?
And who is across the road, coming in your direction? Is the guy on the long board with the iPod a potential threat? What about the girl biking and talking on her cell phone?
So as you get ready to cross, you do not idle. You brace yourself. Perhaps you say a prayer, and hope that you don’t end up at the bottom of a three-student pile-up 15 feet away from Denny’s.
One good distraction from the anxiety of taking your life into your hands is on the nearby advertising kiosks. For example, if you make it to campus with all your internal organs and you are a tall, athletic blonde with a GPA of 3.5 or higher, you can donate your eggs for $20,000.
Or if you are in search of a new apartment, you could rent a studio apartment for $1,500 a month on First and Western avenues, just seconds away from campus (by hovercraft).
If you sold your eggs, you could live there for a year! Assuming you already own a hovercraft.
Or maybe you don’t want to go to class at all. You could contact Alibis & Paybacks!
Alibis & Paybacks is the latest start-up advertised on the coveted Jefferson and Hoover traffic light posts.
The simple concept of A&P is outlined in questionable grammar on both fliers and its website (alibisnpaybacks.com).
Customers may pay the company to a) corroborate or invent an alibi, b) make an anonymous phone call to someone they don’t like and yell at that person or c) publicly humiliate an ex by posting fliers.
If this concept doesn’t sound like the 1998 Norm MacDonald classic Dirty Work to you, then you haven’t spent enough time watching movies at 2 a.m. on Comedy Central.
A&P is offering what every college student needs — a mature way to deal with unpleasant situations. No longer must we resort to text messaging or angry Facebook hacking to exact our revenge.
No, now we can pay someone a cavalier disregard for capitalization to originate an alibi — the dog ate your assignment! — or pretend to be that dog on the phone.
There are more ambiguous features. On the website, which is decorated with a picture of surprisingly and incongruously benign row boats, the company offers to “provide or even post revenge flyers.”
One can only assume these would be posted right next to fliers for A&P.
The strangest and most alarming offer is the “Cuss Out Line.” You provide them with a phone number, tell them what your problem with the person on the other end of the line is and they yell at this person. Anonymously.
Because your ex-boyfriend will never, ever guess who was responsible for the random call that harassed him about his Curious George underwear.
A&P might have more luck than the sperm and egg donation business. And, at least they take our minds off the impending doom of the intersection.

You’re at the “funnest” party you’ve ever been to in your entire life. It happens to be on a rocket ship. Destination: Venus. To top it off, you’re on the verge of taking shots.
That’s how USC’s up-and-coming indie band Y-Luv describes its music.
All night · The members of Y-Luv practice in a storage room at the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity house. The space has become the band’s jamming spot. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
“Our influences are the Clash, Pepper, Bloc Party, Kings of Leon,” said lead singer and guitarist Freddy Janney.
The quirky foursome opened for the Los Angeles-based electronic music duo The Crystal Method’s secret show at the Echoplex in Echo Park on Nov. 7.
“It was nerve-wracking — it was a big crowd. We were just really excited and brought a lot of energy,” said bassist Luke Hanna.
The performance was Y-Luv’s latest accomplishment — and biggest crowd — to date.
After being ranked first in the nation on collegebattleofthebands.com, Y-Luv was selected to compete in the Southern California Regionals. The band out-performed two other groups to snag a spot in the West Semi-Finals at the end of the year and the aforementioned gig for TCM.
“It was a lot of fun. I’ve always gone to see other people at the Echoplex, so it was fun to play it,” Hanna said.
In spite of its growing popularity, Y-Luv’s members are refreshingly down-to-earth. There is a natural chemistry evident in their sarcastic exchanges as well as their jam sessions.
Plenty of both abound in a revamped storage room of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity’s subterranean parking garage, a niche Y-Luv claimed for practice.
Even though Y-Luv’s origins are in Boston, this particular group has only been together since last January, when Hanna joined.
“Since Luke joined, it’s become a band. Before that it was a little bit of a mess,” said guitarist and back-up vocalist Sam Nardella, noting the band didn’t practice as frequently before Hanna arrived.
“A band is made of four people, so when you have one person not doing a lot of work, that’s a 75 percent, that’s a C. I want As,” Nardella joked.
But Nardella didn’t completely discount the band’s last bass player.
“With him we got to start playing; we got to know each other,” he said.
Nardella and Janney brought Y-Luv to Los Angeles from the East Coast, where they went to high school in Boston and started “jamming together.” In total, the band has been together for three years, but not without its trials.
“I want to just tell a story when Sam came up to us and said, ‘I’m going to quit the band,’” said drummer Marcello Dubaz.
“I wanted to be free,” Nardella added. “Freddy made me [rejoin]. I didn’t have strong enough words to say, ‘No.’”
Even the band’s name has undergone some changes.
“I drew the symbol [of a heart encompassing the letter ‘Y’] when I was a senior in high school,” Janney said. “I had a recording studio and started writing songs, and the name came from the symbol. My parents said Y-Love.”
When the band members started playing, however, they quickly found that the name had to be changed.
“There’s a Jewish Hasidic rapper with that name so we changed it to Luv,” Janney laughed. “It’s interesting because the name is not comprised of any actual words.”
In the band’s typical comedic form, Nardella chimed in, “The craziest part about it is that Y-Luv sounds better.”
Phonetics aside, people are starting to love Y-Luv, as evidenced by the band’s success both on campus and in Hollywood. The group has performed at venues like the Plush Lounge at the Key Club, the Knitting Factory, to name a few.
Earlier this year, the group won another battle of the bands competition sponsored by Grammy-U. They were one of two bands chosen to play at Grammy-U’s event, where they had the opportunity to perform in front of a panel of big-name judges, including the music director for Michael Jackson’s tour and a Grammy-winning mastering engineer.
One of the judges, the bass player for Ozzy Osbourne, told Y-Luv, “When you’re on stage, you look like you’re meant to be there,” Hanna said.
Both bands were scored at the event, and Y-Luv won — a bonus because its competition, Louder Than Words, was from across the town at UCLA.
For now, the band is content performing in the moment, save for a few small aspirations, including touring Amsterdam, appearing on Ashton Kutcher’s TV show “Punk’d” and “somehow getting written into the cast of The Hills,” Janney said.
“By the end of it, we just want to be the special guests at all the hot clubs,” Dubaz joked.
Nardella graduates at the end of the year, and Janney hopes he will be able get a job in Los Angeles so the band has at least one more year together until the rest graduate in May 2011.
“Our short-term goal is to make Y-Luv big enough and worth it — unquestionably worth it — to stay together after we graduate,” Hanna said.
But in all seriousness, it is the symbol of the Y in the heart, which beats with the bass drum, that keeps the band grounded.
“If you want to know what gets us going, just look at the bass drum,” Dubaz said.
Right now, it has a strong beat.
I got to check out Y-Luv at the GRAMMY U LA Back to School Concert.  They rocked.  If Freddy leaves the band I can become the lead singer.  I got mad range and can bang a tamborine better than most.  I also play a mean cowbell.  If Sam leaves they should make me the cowbell guy.  A lot of their songs could use more cowbell.  And what’s up with their fraternity having a band room?  How much money does TKE have to throw around on parties and band rooms?
While these Frat boys play in there 3 million dollar toy house Obama is going to follow Bush and escalate the war against the Afgan people.  It is time to end US Imperism against the poor and hungry of the World.  It time for the people to take back control of our country from the racist BCS system that keeps us down!
are you serious? can’t come up with a better story than this sorry band?

Often quoted and always relevant whenever the apocalypse enters a discussion, T.S. Eliot wrote in The Hollow Men: “This is the way the world ends/not with a bang, but a whimper.”
As seen in the success of Roland Emmerich’s eardrum-shattering 2012, people love a good world-destroying bang. The Road, John Hillcoat’s thrilling, faithful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, is more about the bang in the whimper.
Road warriors · The Road, an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s novel of the same name, stars Viggo Mortensen as Man and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Boy. The film follows their journey through a post-apocalyptic world. - Photo courtesy of Dimension Films
In an America devastated by an apocalypse unseen and unnamed but for a flash of light pouring through a window, a father (Viggo Mortensen) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) make their way south from the Northeast. Along the way, they encounter murder, dimming hope and a lot of beautiful devastation.
McCarthy and Hillcoat are no strangers to an apocalyptic vision of the world. McCarthy’s masterpiece Blood Meridian rebranded the myth of the American west as a nihilistic hell-scape, a view taken by Hillcoat in his first feature, The Proposition, about law and lawlessness in the Australian frontier.
This is by no stretch of the imagination an action film, but even now the scenes that linger like fallout after the reel spooled up are the brief interludes of violence and terror that punctuate the wanderings of the father and son.
As much as The Road — with episodes about thieves and cannibals and a constant dialogue between the father and son about the importance of morality — is about the way humanity occupies a post-apocalyptic world, one of the key elements of both McCarthy and Hillcoat’s visions is the way in which the manmade apocalypse has destroyed the environment.
The sky is grey with ash, the world’s animals have died and the two protagonists are constantly troubled by the tumbling forests of the American Northeast. Perhaps even more than in the scenes of human conflict and compromise, Hillcoat’s cinematic translation of McCarthy’s vision accurately captures the terror in an end to the natural world — a fear of the modern age that burns with frightening relevance.
As he has in every role post-Hidalgo, Mortensen displays a range that escalates him to the upper echelon of working actors. As with his two films for David Cronenberg — A History of Violence and Eastern Promises — Mortensen creates a character utterly unique to any that he has played before. Though marked visually by his wild eyes and rugged beard, the man’s crazed desperation in safeguarding his son and his cold devotion to teaching him survival tactics are ingrained in every aspect of a complex performance.
As the boy, Smit-McPhee has a daunting task both in sharing the screen with a seasoned dramatic actor like Mortensen and, more challenging still, developing a character whose background is conceptually utterly foreign to the audience. All the boy has ever known is the traumatic world of violence — a common theme for McCarthy — and to Smit-McPhee’s credit he instills the conflicted young wanderer with a palpable and dynamic personality.
Ultimately, The Road is imperfect as a narrative structure, not as a visual and thematic experience. The episodic way in which the story is told removes some of the gravitas of the story: Events are linked by the perspective of the father and son, but, as is true with McCarthy’s novel, few scenes are given weight or precedence over the others.
The film feels somewhat empty at a core around which potent imagery and relevant themes swirl in beautiful chaos — and Hillcoat’s fatal flaw might be simply refusing to deviate from the source material to give his own vision more emotional weight. The structure worked perfectly for McCarthy’s words, but not as well for Hillcoat’s images.
The film’s post-apocalyptic journey structure necessarily draws comparison to the more linear Children of Men. Essentially, both films share the same flaw in their final frames ­— which ring hollow against all that comes before. Director Alfonso Cuaron was reportedly forced to change the original ending of his film, but, as with the rest of The Road, Hillcoat’s ending is merely following McCarthy’s vision.
The Road left me wanting not necessarily closure, but simply more of the vision. It is a testament to Hillcoat’s abilities — and the strength of his actors — that I didn’t want to leave the horrible world he captured. There might not have been much more to add about the downfall of humanity by the time The Road ends on its own little whimper, but that doesn’t mean the film would have suffered from more of the pure cinematic poetry of the graphic adventures of father and son in a twisted world.
