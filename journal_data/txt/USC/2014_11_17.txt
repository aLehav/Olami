New York University surpassed USC as the nation’s leader in recruiting foreign-born students, according to a new report.
In the 2012-2013 academic year, USC enrolled about 10,900 students born outside the U.S., marking an increase from the previous year, but still lower than NYU’s 11,000 foreign-born students.
The data was from a survey of U.S. colleges conducted by the  New York nonprofit Institute of International Education, in partnership with the U.S. State Department.
“Both institutions remain hugely attractive to international students, with some preferring the West Coast and the strengths of USC and others finding NYC and NYU more appealing,” Peggy Blumenthal, senior counselor to the president for the Institute of International Education, told the Los Angeles Times.
For the past 13 years, USC had reported the highest number of international students attending a U.S. college or university, the L.A. Times reported. This statistic was often shared on USC campus tours as prospective students passed the array of international flags displayed at Von KleinSmid Center.
For students such as Christina Lee, a freshman from Singapore majoring in business administration, being part of a larger group of international students eased the process of acclimating to USC.
“Since USC had the largest international population at the time I applied, it was a plus because since I’ve gotten here, [having a] ton of people just like me, made the transition easier,” Lee said.
UCLA ranked sixth in the survey and UC Berkeley was 18th. Nationally, the number of foreign-born students in the U.S. increased about 8 percent last year, to nearly 886,000. China sent the largest group with about 27,4000 students, more than double the number of students from India, the second biggest group.
Putting aside headcounts, being an international student isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language. Assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. The schools’ emphasis should be on quality of service provided them, not on their numbers.
   A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that helps anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors,
educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they contributed to our society, including students.
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work for an American firm here or overseas.
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here.
   Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow
students, and books like this to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.  Good luck to all wherever you study!

Paco Torres is a steward at Café 84 who works a full-time job at USC. Two months ago, in the face of a rising cost of living and despite working a 35-hour week at USC for the last six years, he ran out of options.
In negotiations · Union representatives, USC employees and students met to discuss new contracts for university employees on Monday night. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
“A couple months ago, I applied for food stamps,” he said.
As union negotiations continue between Torres’ union and the university, his story and the stories of nearly 800 others represented by UNITE HERE Local 11 are what inspire many students to advocate on their behalf.
The Political Student Assembly and the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation hosted the latest #PSATalks event to discuss the negotiations, in which both the university and the union have failed to agree on 10 successive rounds. Torres shared his story with the gathered students and was joined by representatives from the PSA and SCALE, as well as UNITE HERE Local 11.
The event and discussion came after a SCALE rally that took place last Wednesday that featured USC employees marching alongside students. In the hours before the negotiations, organizers said USC offered more money but that it wasn’t enough.
Torres hopes they succeed so he can put food on the table for his family.
“I’ve been working at the university for six years — it’s been tough,” he said. “I was excited to get hired by USC because I was raised by a family two blocks away. My dad used to bring me here to birthday parties.”
The problem stems from the increased cost of living. When Torres began at USC, making ends meet was easier. Now, he says, the rising cost of living doesn’t match his pay increase, leaving him with less and less each year.
“When I came in, I thought it was going to be a pretty good paying job, which it was. As time went on, I thought it was going to be a progress where there was better pay,” he said. “Back when I started, a gallon of milk used to be two or three bucks, now it’s like five, and I have three kids with me. It’s pretty hard to survive on that.”
Work hours, quantity of work and workplace environment are all part of the negotiations. SCALE and union representatives said that when workers demand a wage increase, the counteroffer from the university often includes the wage increase but cuts the hours each employee will work a week.
Torres described an environment that is often understaffed, with managers who don’t call in extra help when an employee who is sick or injured leaves for the day, leaving the remaining workers to work harder with limited overtime pay. He said some cooks have burns up and down their arms but come to work anyways because they can’t afford to take time off.
Torres, though, will talk to anyone who will listen.
“From my understanding, there’s a couple of people working here that are embarrassed about talking about it,” he said. “I’m tired of not talking about it.”

USC will withdraw its recognition of the Zeta Beta chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity for five years according to a press release issued Monday by Interfraternity Council President Tanner Sandoval.
“This decision was made as a result of an extensive investigation conducted by the University’s Title IX office,” Sandoval said in the press release.
Alpha Tau Omega’s national CEO Wynn Smiley elaborated on the allegations of sexual assault levied against Alpha Tau Omega’s Zeta Beta chapter in a press release issued Monday.
In the press release, Smiley cited two separate incidents of alleged sexual assault, in 2013 and 2014, stating that the Title IX office could not establish “a preponderance of the evidence that the member violated the [USC Student Code of Conduct] provisions” for the 2013 case. In the 2014 case, however, the Title IX office did find that a member of Alpha Tau Omega violated the USC Student Code of Conduct, resulting in the university’s decision to withdraw recognition of the fraternity’s chapter at USC.
“We’re currently assessing all our options with the university, and trying to be fair with all our members,” Smiley said in an interview. “We believe that the process was filled with procedural inconsistencies, [and] that one person acted as judge, jury and executioner.”
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry responded to Smiley’s allegations by citing the Title IX investigation process has remained unchanged through both the 2013 and 2014 incidents.
“That is not true … The Title IX coordinator oversees that outcome and then that outcome goes to an appeals panel, called the Student Behavior Appeals Panel,” Carry said. “The appeals panel is made up of three individuals: two faculty members and one staff member that review all of the information collected and they render the information which comes to the vice president for Student Affairs for a thorough review of all the recommendations and the finalization of the decision. There are multiple parties involved in this process.”
Smiley also said any questions of the housing accommodations for ATO house residents for the remainder of the semester were “premature.” Carry, however, stated that a process for providing housing for members of the fraternity is already underway.
“There’s a transition plan being worked out with the ATO leadership here, with our student leaders and our fraternity and sorority leadership office and [Assistant Provost for Student Affairs] Dr. Monique Allard,” he said. “I’m not sure what the national office is aware of or not aware of on the ground, but we’re working with the student leadership and the advisor of the organization to make sure there’s a smooth process for their transition.”
Smiley said in his press release that USC was punishing an entire group for the actions of a single student.
“USC is focusing its considerable and direct punitive power at nearly 110 of its own students who are members of the ATO chapter,” Smiley said in the press release. “At least 109 of the students had no involvement with the allegations and yet are being severely punished by the university.”
Carry justified the university’s actions, stating that allegations of sexual misconduct have an impact beyond the individuals involved.
“One person could violate a policy where multiple people have to pay for it,” Carry said. “If individual members violate the code, it has an impact on everyone. It has an impact on our entire Greek system, not just a house … With regard to that particular incident, [Smiley] has the right to make that allegation and be concerned about that, but it’s not uncommon for individual misconduct to impact many people.”

One of the most polarizing figures in music today, lo-fi pioneer Ariel Pink released pom pom  this week, his third record with 4AD and first without his band, Ariel Pink’s Haunted Graffiti. In 2010, after years of recording cassettes at home in relative obscurity, he and his band found major label success with their single “Round and Round,” which was named the best song of the year by Pitchfork. Suddenly, everyone was talking about Pink and his non-conforming antics. One was more likely to hear about the dress he wore or the meltdown he had onstage than anything specific about his music, though. With pom pom’s release, it seems not much has changed -— he continues to stir up controversy with inflammatory remarks, and the music itself is more gimmicky than ever.
More of the same · Evoking memories of Frank Zappa and David Bowie, Ariel Pink’s first solo album provides more of his signature quirky and irreverent style but doesn’t provide much in terms of musicality. – Photo courtesy of 4AD
The opening track, “Plastic Raincoats In the Pig Parade,” sets the tone from the beginning, letting you know that nothing Pink does should be taken completely seriously. Backed by xylophones and a shouting chorus of children’s voices, it could pass for a song from an educational kid’s TV show. That is, until it introduces sirens, horse neighing and starts to rewind mid-song.
Pink’s record is littered with obvious examples of Frank Zappa’s influence — particularly the commercials Zappa recorded for products like Luden’s Cough Drops. There is even a track called “Jell-O,” which is a fake commercial for the product that is almost too similar to what Zappa was doing to be influenced, instead delving into the realm of imitation. He has always drawn comparisons to Zappa, and for good reason — this album features a healthy dose of absurd animal noises, industrial street sound, rewinding tapes and a great deal of sardonically sweet melodies. Unfortunately, Pink lacks Zappa’s talent for arrangement and knowledge of theory, which allowed him to change time signatures, modes and genres at the drop of a hat. Similarly, Pink’s band lacks the technical prowess that led to memorable solos and instrumental interludes on Zappa’s work.
The other pop music icon that Pink is sure to invoke in listeners’ minds is David Bowie. Again, the invocation is not in the sense that he has made anything near as original or important as what Bowie made. In fact, it’s just the opposite. Tracks like “Not Enough Violence” are not just modern takes on Berlin-era Bowie or other new wave bands like The Human League; they are Pink speak-singing in a deep baritone register over cheesy synth lines in an attempt to sound exactly like them. The problem is that it’s hard to tell if he is making fun of the music or genuinely trying to recreate it. Either way, it was new and interesting 25 or 30 years ago, but now it’s just derivative.
That’s the problem with this album and Pink’s persona as a whole — he puts on a completely different voice from song to song in an attempt to hide himself. Switching characters so often makes it impossible to know which one is real and which one is satirical. This perpetual state of irony is what allows him to publically deride Madonna and 4AD label-mate Grimes, or say misogynistic and homophobic remarks in interviews. He can always distance himself from his statements and later claim that he was joking, or acting as part of a larger meta-commentary. The problem is, he never gets around to stating this honest commentary or revealing his true self. This is the inevitable fate of a career that is based almost completely on tongue-in-cheek imitations.
The closest he gets to a song that is not a reference to someone else is probably “Goth Bomb,” a two-and-a-half-minute punk song about his goth days in high school. Still, he can’t resist putting on his Iggy Pop voice and slipping into barking as he repeats the chorus of “Why can’t I write the words?” over and over. This track is a reworking of his previously released “Where Does My Mind Go,” and is one of many that are just reworkings of material we have already heard. Other than a few added words, “Lipstick” sounds the same as “Shower Me With Lipstick” off of his YAS DuDette compilation with Haunted Graffiti, and “Nude Beach a Go-Go” featuring Azealia Banks actually came out on her record first.
“Exile On Frog Street” is at the other end of the spectrum of “Goth Bomb” in terms of its originality. Aside from the title being a play on The Rolling Stone’s classic 1972 album Exile On Main Street, the track leans heavily on the crutches of frog and duck noises, strange accents and a long spoken monologue about Pink being kissed and turned into a prince. Though some might genuinely like the song for its humor, an artist can only have so much material that imitates an annoying commercial or a repetitive children’s show intro before the humor and value of it is outweighed by how actually annoying and repetitive it is, and you forget that you’re listening to a 30-something hipster darling and actually feel like you’re listening to The Wiggles.
Ariel Pink is not the only eccentric slacker character whose rise to fame can be more accurately attributed to the cult of personality that surrounds him than anything particular about his music; people like Mac DeMarco and Tyler, the Creator can be described similarly. The difference is that even these wild characters at some point show their listeners what they stand for by aligning themselves with something. By making fun of everything, Pink, on the other hand, defines himself only by what he dislikes and what he is not. It doesn’t matter that none of pom pom is original, difficult or sincere; you can still be a fan of the way he stirs up controversy by putting down mainstream artists in interviews, or his knack for cross-dressing, or the pink donuts and pink nail painting being offered at the release parties in Los Angeles this week. In a way, Pink’s fans who cite these gimmicks when asked why they like him are no different than those who cite Miley Cyrus’ twerking or Justin Beiber’s current girlfriend when asked why they like them. Like these artists, pom pom is bastion to modern music’s commitment to spectacle over substance.

American supermarkets, restaurants and other food retailers fail to donate, on average, 82 percent of their viable, unused food at the end of each day. American supermarkets, restaurants and other food retailers waste, on average, a shocking 45 percent of their daily food inventory. On average, U.S. supermarkets alone throw out $41 million worth of fruits and vegetables every day and, at any given supermarket, $2,300 worth of seafood, meat and dairy products will end up in the dumpster.
Team effort · USC students Etai Evenhaim and Jordan Banafsheha worked with co-founder Maor Chasen to develop the app at a hackathon. They were passionate about the concept so they pursued the project afterwards. – Photo courtesy of Jordan Banafsheha
USC students Etai Evenhaim, a junior majoring in business administration, and Jordan Banafsheha, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration, have witnessed the effects of food insecurity firsthand and, upon learning that so much food goes to waste, realized they could be part of a much needed change and created Bread & Butter, a platform to connect food retailers to underserved communities and nonprofits for the distribution of excess food.
“It’s all around us, especially at USC, and we decided we could do something that might be able to relieve some of that,” Banafsheha said.
Evenhaim, who witnessed the trials of a friend in high school who faced food insecurity, and Banafsheha, who grew up surrounded by homelessness, joblessness and food insecurity in Los Angeles, worked alongside co-founder Maor Chasen last June at a Tel Aviv hackathon to develop Bread & Butter. As the three collaborated to discuss ideas for their hackathon project, Evenhaim was particularly passionate about helping communities and people beset by food insecurity and suggested they try to create an app to do just that.
Evenhaim and Banafsheha wanted to facilitate a project that would not only help communities but also be a viable busines venture. Luckily, after a bit of research, the team discovered that retailers get tax credit for any food they donate. Thus, Bread & Butter was born.
The team went on to win the hackathon with the first version of their idea, and afterward, they decided to continue their work on it. They brought the app to Los Angeles, where Evenhaim and Banafsheha are based, but continue to collaborate with Chasen, who lives in Jerusalem.
“The ideas that are created [at hackathons] don’t usually turn into businesses, but we were really passionate about the idea and decided to keep going with it, especially once we noticed an inefficiency in the interaction between nonprofits and food retailers and saw an opportunity for great business,” Banafsheha said.
The main obstacles in their endeavor came in the form of logistical issues — retailers get tax receipts for their donations, but the paperwork associated with the receipts is tedious and difficult for businesses to complete, so most don’t bother with it and throw away their food. Bread & Butter aims to be a platform for these businesses, connecting them with nonprofits for easy donation and helping to complete their tax receipt paperwork for simpler filing and incentives. Participating businesses will also receive official certificates to display (think Zagat rating stickers) so patrons know a restaurant is donating.
Bread & Butter’s most integral component is the app, which connects retailers with available food to nonprofits and shelters in need. Retailers can list their available food at the end of the day; these listings become immediately available to nonprofits that can then claim any food they will use and go pick it up.
Restaurants can also choose not to donate their food when they think the amount is too small to help shelters. Bread & Butter is tackling this challenge by adding technology that will create efficient routes for nonprofits. As businesses list their donations on the app, it creates routes for nonprofits to follow to provide maximum donation potential for both the retailers and the nonprofits who can visit multiple retailers in one route and receive as much food as possible.
As Bread & Butter expands and grows — the beta version will launch in a couple of weeks — Evenhaim and Banafsheha want to bring USC into its mix as well. The Bread & Butter team has approached USC Hospitality to get all 40 of USC’s dining halls and food retailers on board with the program.
According to Banafsheha, shelters around Los Angeles are so lacking in resources and donations that they often have to buy food, spending what little money they have on food for their inhabitants instead of on infrastructure improvements, repairs or hiring more staff. Bread & Butter’s goal of providing more food to shelters and nonprofits in need would allow them to spend their already limited resources on more and improved amenities for the communities they serve. This will provide widespread benefits — not only will it ameliorate shelters, but it will strengthen relationships within communities and equip more people with the food they need to survive.
The app’s beta version will launch with partners Bacaro and Nature’s Brew in order to work out any kinks and get en vivo feedback before its official launch in the next few months. The final version of the app will be up and working for nonprofits and for the two initial retailers as the Bread & Butter team continues to add retailers and cater to more nonprofits in need. The team hopes to reach as many Los Angeles restaurants as possible on the platform in the next year before hiring more staff and expanding to other major cities.
“We wanted to help people and start right where we live,” Banafsheha said.

When I first began writing this column, my goal was to motivate college students to approach cooking in a new and different way. I encouraged students to depart from unhealthy eating habits and experiment with simple yet unfamiliar techniques. While I stand by this mission and hope that many of you have benefitted from my weekly musings about roasted vegetables and pre-cooked grains, there is also something to be said about foods more traditionally associated with college students’ lifestyles.
Tasty treat · Muesli is a healthy alternative to sugary breakfast cereal and can be adapted using a variety of nuts, seeds and dried fruits. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
 
Students love convenient and familiar dishes such as grilled cheese sandwiches and cereal. Even the most inexperienced cooks have probably fried an egg or made avocado toast before; the recipes are so simple that most of us prepare them almost instinctively. Though these dishes require little embellishment to satisfy, I decided to improve upon the old standards using fresher, more interesting ingredients.
Rather than complicate the fundamental techniques behind these dishes, simple tweaks and ingredient substitutions go a long way. Learning how to soft-scramble eggs will forever change your perception of breakfast. Low heat and patience are the keys to achieving succulent, silky-smooth curds. Coax the eggs gently around the pan, removing them when they are moist and just set. The final result is more luxurious than the usual dry, overcooked scramble but requires no additional effort on your part.
My strawberry and goat cheese quesadilla recipe puts a colorful twist on the Mexican staple. Though the combination may sound unusual, just go with it. The sweet strawberries perfectly complement the creamy, slightly tangy goat cheese and crunchy tortillas. The dish’s fresh flavors make it ideal for any meal of the day, or even as a quick snack to share with friends.
Naturally sweetened with honey and bound together with only two tablespoons of oil, homemade muesli is a healthy alternative to the sugary cereals many college students subsist on. Muesli is similar to granola, except lighter. It takes minutes to mix together in one bowl, and like most of the recipes in this column, can be adapted using a variety of nuts and dried fruits.
So next time you decide to make a reliable dish, healthy or not, try enhancing it using unconventional ingredients and flavor pairings. Treat this week’s recipes as templates rather than strict guidelines, inspiring you to put your own unique spins on the basics.
Soft-scrambled Eggs 
• 2 large eggs
• 2 tablespoons milk or cream
• 1 tablespoon of butter or non-stick cooking spray
• Salt and pepper to taste
Total: 5 min. Serves 1.
1. Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat them with the milk or cream. Season with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Place a small pan on medium-low heat and coat the pan with butter.
2. Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Using a rubber spatula, whisk gently and repeatedly while scraping the bottom and sides of the pan, until eggs are just thickened, creamy and small curds begin to form, 2 to 4 minutes total. (If mixture begins to stick to pan while cooking, remove from heat; whisk gently for 30 seconds, then continue cooking over heat). Remove from heat and serve immediately.
Strawberry and Goat Cheese Quesadilla 
Recipe adapted from sproutedkitchen.com
• 1 teaspoon olive oil
• 2 large tortillas, preferably whole wheat
• 1/3 cup softened goat cheese
• 1/3 cup grated mozzarella cheese
• Handful of strawberries, thinly sliced
• Black pepper to taste
Total: 10 min. Serves 1-2.
1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spread one side of each tortilla with half of the goat cheese, leaving about a ½ inch border around the edge.
2. Add one of the tortillas cheese-side-up to the pan. Sprinkle it with the grated mozzarella and a pinch of pepper, top with an even layer of the strawberry slices and cover with the other tortilla. Cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the bottom of the tortilla is browned and crunchy. Flip the quesadilla and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes on the other side.
3. Remove the pan from the heat. Transfer the tortilla to a cutting board and slice into equal wedges. Serve.

Hidden in a little hole in the wall on Hollywood Boulevard across the street from McDonald’s blinking golden arches and a questionable storefront selling wigs is a glamorous new restaurant serving the hip Hollywood crowd. Butchers & Barbers’ 1920s Hollywood memorabilia and dim, smoky, lounge-like ambiance aptly balance out the classic American fare.

Founded by established L.A. nightlife experts and brothers Mark and Jonnie Houston, Butchers & Barbers has the same undeniably classy vibe that has made a line outside of their nightlife spots such as Good Times at Davey Wayne’s an inescapable guarantee.
Since signs seem to be out of style, it might be hard for new patrons to find Butchers & Barbers in its inconspicuous shopfront next to some very famous Hollywood stars’ actual Hollywood Stars. The only tipoff they’ll receive is a white valet umbrella, a classic Hollywood sign that something posh is waiting on the other side of the door. Patrons who do not want to pay the $8 for valet on weekdays or $10 on weekends, can attempt to find street parking on any of the cross streets.
Upon entering the restaurant, customers are greeted by hostess dressed in 1920s-themed suspenders and asked if they have made a reservation. If customers do decide to call ahead, Butchers & Barbers will seat them immediately. If they try to just drop in, their best bet is the first-come, first-served bar — tables are usually booked from open to close.
Aside from wearing adorable themed costumes, the staff at Butchers & Barbers is helpful, though it is clear that they, along with the kitchen, are still struggling to get their sea legs. Having opened just about three weeks ago, the restaurant runs impressively well, but certain things, such as knowledge of appropriate wine pairings, still need to be worked on.
One look at the classic American menu will leave customers’ mouths watering, but food service is slow, so if anyone is really hungry, it’s a good idea to order drinks and something off of the snack menu first.
Butchers & Barbers feels and acts like a bar. Drinks — all $12 — are incredible, not ridiculously priced and made and served quickly. Cocktails, which have names like Greta Garbo and Lillian Gish, are perfectly balanced and beautifully presented.
The menu at this new Hollywood addition is divided into Snacks, Garden, Sea and Farm. The first section, Snacks, range in price and are nothing to write home about — the popcorn with roasted garlic, rosemary and thyme oil, $4, is great with a cocktail but all together too salty to enjoy by itself.
Following Snacks, head chef Luke Reyes has a gorgeous Garden section featuring locally sourced produce and imaginative serving suggestions. Ranging from $10 to $18, the Garden selection offers delicious appetizers, but the prices are steep. One of the highlights on the menu is the delicata squash with persimmon, fresh burrata and smoked trout roe. For $16, patrons are treated to three pieces of tasty squash perfectly balanced with salty trout roe and rich burrata.
Entrées are divided into Sea and Farm, ranging from about $10 to to $90 for cote de boeuf. Each choice, including the fish, is hearty and substantial. Though portions are Hollywood-sized — in other words, small — Butchers & Barbers is not a good choice for someone trying to watch their cholesterol or stick to some semblance of a diet. Depending on how hungry the table is, these slightly bigger portions are barely enough to share.
For $10, the pork rillettes with grilled bread were delicious. Rillettes are essentially pork that has been cooked in its own fat, shredded and then chilled with salt and its own fat again to be made into a paste similar to a paté. Butchers & Barbers aces this dish — it isn’t too salty and the grilled bread is the perfect simple accompaniment to let the rillettes shine.
The grilled hanger steak, with Point Reyes blue cheese butter and la ratte potatoes, $24, is another hit on the menu. Though the blue cheese butter is altogether too rich and completely distracts from the steak, the meat itself is cooked to perfection and is a great portion for sharing. Customers should be sure to specify how they want their meat cooked, however, since everything came out rather rare even after a medium cook was requested.
For a student who’s looking for a fun dining experience, Butchers & Barbers does not disappoint. A meal for two including one glass of wine and one cocktail but no dessert came out to about $90. Butchers & Barbers is open Tuesday through Sunday, 6 p.m. to 2 a.m.

Deepak Ahuja, the Chief Financial Officer of Tesla Motors, spoke about his role at the company and the lessons he has learned from working there to kick off the Trojan Scholars Society’s Distinguished Lecture Series in Tutor Campus Center on Monday night.
Top gear · Deepak Ahuja, the chief financial officer of Tesla Motors, spoke to students as part of the Trojan Scholars Society Distinguished Lecture Series at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Monday night. — Tucker McWhirter | Daily Trojan
“Tonight we hope to begin to develop what will be a full year long distinguished lecture series,” said Austin Reagan, a junior majoring in political science and environmental studies and co-chair of Trojan Scholars Society.
Tesla Motors is a company co-founded by entrepreneur Elon Musk with the goal of creating fully electric cars. Ahuja was recently was named a 2014 CFO of the Year by the San Francisco Business Times.
After receiving a master’s degree in materials engineering at Northwestern University and a master’s in business administration at Carnegie Mellon University, Ahuja worked at Ford Motor Company until 2008, when he was asked to be the CFO at Tesla.
“At that time it was a very small company with about 200 employees,” Ahuja said. “They had yet to sell a single car.”
Ahuja spoke about his first interaction with Musk.
“Interestingly, he already had a reputation not as a great innovator, but more of a ruthless leader,” Ahuja said. “When I spoke with him, it just blew my mind. He was an incredible person, an amazing innovator, and had the vision and the guts to change the automotive industry in a way no one could imagine.”
The switch from Ford to Tesla was a life changing decision for Ahuja. He and his family left Michigan to begin work and school in Palo Alto, California at Tesla headquarters. One of Ahuja’s daughters is a current junior at USC. Ahuja explained the impact this decision had on him.
“I was doing very well at Ford, living a very comfortable lifestyle and could see myself retiring from Ford and life would have been just fine,” Ahuja said. “On the other hand, I could go down an uncharted path, take a huge risk, and it was a tough call but I decided to take a leap of faith in Elon.”
For Ahuja, working for Tesla has led him to focus on developing relationships.
“To be a good CFO, one has to build very strong relationships with the executives to see how to effectively give them direction on things to do better and differently and to guide them to stay aligned with the organization,” Ahuja said.
Ahuja credited his engineering background for the foundation of his success as CFO of Tesla.
“Engineering gives me sufficient basis and also the mindset of how I think, but as I look back, it is the combination of all these things that ultimately prepared me to be the CFO of Tesla,” Ahuja said.
Students who attended the event said they were inspired by Ahuja.
“I think his experience makes him a lot more qualified than most,” said Andrew Morris, a sophomore majoring in mathematics and natural sciences. “I was inspired by the fact that he was really comfortable with his job and he decided that he was inspired to do something different, because a lot of people, I think, ignore that inspiration, or don’t think it is worth pursuing.”
Ahuja pointed out the quality of students at USC.
“You all will go on and make amazing careers with your lives,” Ahuja said. “It is indeed a pleasure to be here with you. You all should be very proud of being here.”

As sports journalists, it is incumbent upon us to be impartial observers, to be conveyors of information without bias. But this is a column by an editor of the Daily Trojan, and it’s Conquest Week. So I’m going to be almost as unbiased as Lou Holtz talking about Everett Golson’s Heisman Trophy candidacy.
Hunting Hundley · Quarterback Brett Hundley has twice led UCLA to wins over USC, including a 35-14 victory at the Coliseum last season. – Photo courtesy of Scott Chandler
I wish I could tell you that the Trojans are going to suffer from depth problems, that the Trojans are going to “bend and break” against Bruin quarterback Brett Hundley, that the Trojans just aren’t talented enough to stop him. That UCLA’s vaunted defense led by linebacker Myles Jack is going to tear through that inexperienced Trojan offensive line and grind USC’s offense to a halt. But then I’d be lying to you, and my parents didn’t raise me to be a liar.
They did, however, raise me to see UCLA in a favorable light. They told me that UCLA was this glorious bastion of pure academia on a hill, where the scent of parchment and freshly-mown grass wafted through the air. UCLA kids just “get it,” my mother would tell me. They care about academics and stick to their studies, unlike kids at that “other school.” All that “other school” cares about is football.
So as a young kid, I grew up a UCLA fan. I rooted against the Trojans and wanted them to lose because my parents taught me to love UCLA and Cal. But as I started high school, I became fascinated with USC — the fact that USC was always the silent school with an insanely loyal fan base, despite being inferior to UCLA in most statistically measured academic categories. What I noticed, though, was that it was always UCLA being outspoken in their hatred of USC and USC always remaining silent and choosing to flash their “victory” signs.
There was something noble in the way Trojans carried themselves; the age-old  rivalry persisted, and my fascination with ’SC’s silent loyalty finally won me over. I became dead set on becoming a Trojan. It wasn’t because I hated UCLA — it was the fact that a fan base shouldn’t be completely galvanized around hating another school, which, to me, is the hinge from which the UCLA school spirit pendulum swings.
As for USC, the defining trait of a Trojan is faithfulness. Loyalty has been, and always will be, that one thing that brings USC students together. Our collective sense is not necessitated by our hatred of another school, but rather a sense of solidarity that is intrinsic to the Trojan experience. It is for this reason, among many others, that I am proud to be a Trojan.
In recent years, however, the Trojans have fallen to UCLA in unseemly fashion. The loyalty of the fan base has been shaken. When I found out that USC was returning thousands of tickets back to UCLA because it was unable to sell the seats at the Rose Bowl for this Saturday’s matchup, I was heartbroken.
Whether it’s the recruits moving across town to avoid sanctions or others, such as UCLA defensive lineman Eddie Vanderdoes stabbing the Trojans in the back to go to Westwood, UCLA has gotten the better of USC the past two years and rebounded from that 50-0 game in fine fashion.
My colleague and Daily Trojan sports editor Aubrey Kragen already spoke to this phenomenon of a weakening fan base last week, but the point needs emphasis: Now is not the time for the USC fan base to shrink away. This was and is a school that stands firm in the face of adversity. We fight on as Trojans — that means whether the heartbreak comes in entire seasons (2012) or in single games (ASU, Utah, Boston College, et al.), we pick ourselves back up and show up to the next game ready to strike fear into the hearts of our opponents.
The smart play is to say this Saturday’s game is going to be a close one: Both teams are talented, both teams have struggled and shown flashes of brilliance throughout the season. I’ve correctly predicted all of USC’s games against the spread this season, and I’m putting my flawless record on the line.
The analyst in me is screaming not to become a homer. But here goes nothing: UCLA’s short-lived rental of the Victory Bell ends this Saturday. The Trojans will win, 42-7.
It’s poor practice to make a pick on emotion, I know. From the outside looking in, it’s career suicide to admit that I made a choice based on allegiances — but to members of the Trojan family, I’m sure it makes perfect sense. I’m the editor of the Daily Trojan, a sports columnist of three semesters and might one day work in sports media — but I am nothing if not a Trojan first.

It’s because we’re so spoiled with being a perennial football powerhouse that we cannot accept anything less. We need to deal with the fact that the Pete Carroll era is over. The fans in the early 80s had to accept that the McKay and Robinson days were over. That’s why we’re fairweather fans.
GREAT ARTICLE!  FEAR NOT about TROJAN PRIDE & perceived “Trojan Flight!”    FYI:  from what I understand, the tickets for the UGLY game are less expensive on StubHub and other ticket outlets.  So I believe the Trojans will be there in force. representing TROJAN PRIDE as ALIVE & FLYING HIGH!! BEAT THE bRUINS! FIGHT ON!

Junior wideout Nelson Agholor was announced Monday as one of the 10 semifinalists for the Biletnikoff Award, given each season to the nation’s top wide receiver.
Whoa, Nelly · Junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor has impressed in his last two games, including a career-best 16 receptions against Cal last week. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the honor was announced at a time in the season when Agholor is coming on strong. In the last four games, the Tampa, Florida, native has averaged 168.5 yards per game and totalled six receiving touchdowns.
In his last two games, at Washington State and against Cal, Agholor has picked up 220 and 216 receiving yards, respectively. In this two-week span, he has become the only USC player in history to go for over 200 yards in consecutive games and tied a school record for 200-yard receiving games in a season.
Agholor has already surpassed his yards total from 2013 with 1079 through only 10 games. He has also averaged 13.2 yards per reception.
Agholor is near the top nationally in a multitude of statistical categories. He is eighth in total reception yards, ninth in total receiving touchdowns with 10, 10th in receiving yards per game at 107.9 and third in receptions per game at 8.2.
Agholor has also made waves as a punt returner this year: He is second in punt return touchdowns with two and 10th in punt returns yards per game at 13.1.
Agholor is ranked 12th on USC’s career reception list and seventh in career punt return yards. He is the only Trojan to be ranked that high on both lists.
The other semifinalists for the Biletnikoff include Amari Cooper of Alabama, Rashad Greene of Florida State, Rashard Higgins of Colorado State, Tyler Lockett of Kansas State, Vince Mayle of Washington State, Sterling Shepard of Oklahoma, Nelson Spruce of Colorado, Jaelen Strong of Arizona State and Kevin White of West Virginia.
Agholor has a chance to become the second Trojan to win the Biletnikoff and the third Pac-12 player in a row to win the award after Oregon State’s Brandin Cooks took it home in 2013.
Three finalists will be named on Nov. 24, and the winner will be announced during the College Football Home Depot Awards Show on Dec. 11. Therefore, the Trojans’ showdown with UCLA this weekend is Agholor’s last audition for the Biletnikoff.
The award nomination was not the only good news for Agholor. He was also named the Pac-12’s Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against Cal. It is the first Pac-12 weekly award of Agholor’s career, and the seventh for a Trojan this season. Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, junior defensive end Leonard Williams, senior kicker Andre Heidari, redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen and freshman cornerback-wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson have all been honored this season.

After losing to Pepperdine 2-1 on Sept. 21 — their first loss of the season — the Women of Troy entered Saturday’s first-round NCAA tournament game eager to exact revenge and upset the No. 4-seeded Waves (15-2-4, 6-1-2 WCC). Despite being outshot 8-4 in the first half, USC (12-6-3, 6-5 Pac-12) drew first blood in the 44th minute after freshman midfielder Nicole Molen headed a corner kick from junior midfielder Jamie Fink past Pepperdine goalie Hannah Seabert.
Run of the Mills · Sophomore defender Kayla Mills was a key contributor for USC this season, starting 19 matches and scoring two goals. The West Covina, California, native also received All-Pac-12 First Team honors. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The intensity picked up in the second half as the Waves made a push to equalize. It seemed as though the Women of Troy’s defense might hold the lead until the 70th minute, when standout Pepperdine forward Lynn Williams fired a shot from just outside the box that looked as though it might sneak inside the left goalpost. USC senior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley dived and was able to block the shot, but the ball deflected off her hands and into the penalty box. Pepperdine forward Kristen Rodriguez was the closest player to the loose ball, and was able to put it into the back of the net.
Both teams had excellent chances to take the lead in the remaining minutes, but neither could capitalize. The 1-1 score remained unchanged through two overtime periods as Stanley and the USC defensive line were able to weather eight Waves’ shot attempts. The Women of Troy had two shots of their own, including a healthy scoring opportunity for junior forward/midfielder Tamara Mejia, who broke free in the box on an diagonal run toward the right side of the goal in the second OT period but was unable to angle her shot past Seabert.
With the tie intact after both 10-minute overtime periods, the two teams began a sudden death penalty kick shootout. Home-team Pepperdine fired the first shot when midfielder Rylee Baisden lined up first for the Waves, but her PK was stuffed by Stanley. It seemed as though the Women of Troy were poised to stage an upset.
In USC’s ensuing PK, however, Fink was unable to sneak her shot into the left corner of the net. The two teams then traded PK scores, as USC sophomore defenders Mandy Freeman and Kayla Mills matched their Pepperdine counterparts with goals of their own.
Unfortunately, the tide turned in the Waves’ favor during the fourth set of PK’s, when Williams scored for Pepperdine. USC junior forward Katie Johnson hoped to equalize, but Seabert dived to her left to save the goal. With a 3-2 lead and one set of kicks remaining, Pepperdine defender Courtney Assumma perfectly placed her shot into the corner of the net, sealing the victory for the Waves and ending the Women of Troy’s season.
The heartbreaking early playoff exit leaves a bitter aftertaste to what was a relatively successful season for USC. With Saturday’s loss, the team’s overall winning percentage dropped to .571, a respectable mark for a team that had just four seniors on the roster and was under the guidance of a brand new coaching staff, led by Keidane McAlpine, 2013’s Pac-12 Coach of the Year at Washington State.
The team started the season at a blistering pace, with victories in six of their first eight games. That stretch included a 2-1 victory over then-No. 9 Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, and saw the Women of Troy climb to a No. 14 national ranking, their highest rank since they were ranked No. 12 overall in the second week of the 2009 season. Their first loss of the season also marked the end of the non-conference schedule.
Unfortunately, the team struggled during the first half of the Pac-12 slate, losing four of their first six games. Following this stretch, however, and with their playoff hopes fading, the Women of Troy rallied to win four consecutive road matchups, including two overtime thrillers at Oregon (1-0, 2OT) and Oregon State (2-1, OT), followed by victories over then-No. 17 Washington (2-1) and then-No. 22 Washington State (1-0).
In the final game of the season, the Women of Troy hosted crosstown rival and No. 1 overall UCLA at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. More than 10,000 fans poured into the stadium to watch the game, setting a new NCAA record for attendance in a regular season game. The Women of Troy fell 2-0 at the feet of the Bruins but did manage to keep the game scoreless until the 79th minute.
Since day one, the team had the goal of making it to the postseason. They accomplished this objective, and though they were bounced from the playoffs earlier than they had hoped, they can reflect on the campaign with a feeling of pride for achieving their season-long aspiration. USC’s selection for postseason play marked the first NCAA tournament appearance for the program since 2010 under former head coach Ali Khosroshahin. Khosroshahin led USC to its only NCAA title in his first year as head coach in 2007, but struggled in more recent years before being replaced by McAlpine last winter.
Not only was the season successful from a team standpoint, but it also featured a variety of individual successes. Mills, who played forward, midfield and defense this season, was selected to the All-Pac-12 First Team. Fink, who racked up six goals and six assists, received all-Pac-12 Honorable Mention for the second season in a row. Freshman forward Sydney Sladek earned a selection to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team with two goals and four assists.
There were plenty of other notable individual awards as well: Junior midfielder Reilly Parker and junior forward Katie Johnson were honored with Pac-12 Player of the Week awards during the season. Freeman was selected to a Top Drawer Soccer Team of the Week, and junior defender Whitney Pitalo won a Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week award, the first USC player to win the award since it was created in 2012.
Stanley won Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Week two times, becoming the first USC goalie to win a weekly award since 2009. Finally, senior forward Alex Quincey, who led the team with 10 goals — including four game-winners — finished tied for fifth in the conference in goals scored and became the first USC player to score double-digit goals in a season since Olympian and Team USA member Amy Rodriguez scored 10 during the team’s 2007 NCAA Championship season.
With the season now completed, the Women of Troy will say a heartfelt goodbye to the four seniors who led them this season: defender Heather Davis and forward Jessica Musmanno, as well as Quincey and Stanley. The latter pair addressed the bittersweet ends of their collegiate careers.
“Playing for USC has been like a dream come true,” Musmanno said. “I’m from New Jersey and never thought I would come out to California to play soccer. Getting to play soccer in paradise with some of my best friends has made my four years worth it.”
Stanley echoed Musmanno’s appreciation.
“This school has given me more opportunities than I ever could have dreamed of,” Stanley said. “I played high school soccer in the middle of Missouri. I never thought I would end up out here on the West Coast playing soccer at a school like USC, and I feel so blessed to have been given this opportunity. It has been a blast … a real freakin’ blast.”
After reflecting on Saturday’s loss, the Women of Troy will turn their sights toward next season, when the team will look to take the next step toward winning an NCAA Championship. Having played a season under McAlpine already and with a large number of returning players, the program is poised to rise. That, in and of itself, is satisfactory, says Stanley, who was adamant all season long that she wanted to end her senior season with the program in a better place than when the year began.
“The new coaching staff, the new girls and the returning girls have all put their heart and soul into rebuilding this program,” Stanley said. “We have the university’s support, and that is really important for girls around the entire country to see. USC women’s soccer is on the rise. A new era is beginning here. That’s what I am most proud of.”

Last Sunday marked the International Day for Tolerance, an annual observance initiated by UNESCO in 1995. Tolerance has been gaining ground in recent years, but ironically, it doesn’t always mean peace. As the holidays draw near, conflicts bred in the name of tolerance abound, and it’s no longer just about whether evergreens should be called “holiday trees” or “Christmas trees.” The Montgomery Board of Education has now applied the notion of tolerance to the school calendar — but in the most insensitive way.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
Last Tuesday, the public school board voted to eliminate references to all religious holidays from next year’s school calendar in Montgomery County, Maryland. Christmas, Easter, Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah are among days omitted. Schools, however, will still close on the same days, but only because they happen to coincide with high rates of student and staff absenteeism. As board members have made clear, days off aren’t meant to observe those religious holidays — they say such closures are not legally permitted.
The move was made as a response to the requests of the county’s Muslim community to recognize its faith by setting aside an off-day for Eid al-Adha. But beyond failing to find a solution to equal billing for all faiths, the board has taken two steps back in antagonizing Judeo-Christian communities. And it’s nowhere closer to equality.
It’s true that nothing about the number of days off changes, and perhaps, the reasons cited aren’t inherently wrong — legally speaking. In nearby northern Virginia, Fairfax and Loudoun counties both have secular calendars. Religious neutrality in a multicultural district is understandable, and technically speaking, schools are really supposed to be closed because of operational purposes during the holidays and not because a specific religious holiday needs to be celebrated.
But to remove religious holidays from the calendar in direct response to a request for equal billing from the Muslim community is not right. As Washington Post columnist Alexandra Petri wrote, “It’s cutting off your Christmas to spite your Eid.” In failing to come up with the mature solution to the request to add a day in respect of Eid al-Adha, the board has also dealt a blow to other religious communities. It’s a move that levels down instead of up to achieve more “equity.”
Granted, the school board is attempting to do what is fair in a difficult situation. According to the Baltimore Sun, board officials said that schools won’t close annually for Eid al-Adha because the number of absences is minimal — only 2.4 percent higher than the number of absences on an average day. It seems fair to dismiss the request and take out all religious references, but whether it’s right is another question. No matter how small the minority is, its equality and voice need to be protected in more than just a half-hearted way that causes more controversy within other communities. Freedom of religion doesn’t translate to a secular calendar that strikes off all religious references — it’s supposed to provide an opportunity to come together in support of one of America’s strongest values. That’s something we should all agree upon.

As for tolerance – the only tolerance Muslims are being
taught – is that others tolerate their intolerance!

Though the weather in Los Angeles might lead you to think otherwise, the holiday season is fast approaching. That is, for everyone except the Montgomery County (Maryland) Board of Education.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
Last week, the board voted in a seven-to-one decision to drop all references to religious holidays from its days off on the official 2015-2016 school calendar, including Christmas, Easter, Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah. The board made the decision after the Muslim community’s request for school leaders to give equal billing to the major Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha on its calendar.
Though the board’s decision was made in an attempt to appease those who would like to see more religious representation in the school’s official calendar, the move to nix all references to religious holidays is a poor, offensive and ultimately pointless answer.
The decision was met with warranted criticism, as many perceived it as a measure that would simply keep things exactly as they were before with the same days off. Going forward, the new calendar will only reflect the days the state requires the county to be closed, as well as the days that have shown a high level of student and staff absenteeism.
“The best way to accommodate the diversity of our community is to not make choices about which communities we’re going to respect in our calendar and which ones we’re not going to respect,” Board President Phil Kauffmann told WHQR Public Radio.
Though the decision to refer to school holidays as “winter break” and “spring break” isn’t a big deal, the fact that it came on the heels of the Muslim community’s appeal to be included in the school calendar, is. Rather than address the grievances of a community that makes up approximately 10 percent of the county’s population, the board instead chose to make a mockery of their request for equal billing on the school calendar under the pretense of maintaining neutrality when there so clearly isn’t any.
The board’s decision to rebrand holidays by pretending that school breaks coincide with religious holidays merely by chance insults the intelligence of the citizens of Montgomery County. The Muslim community wasn’t asking the county to expunge religion from its official calendar. Rather, they simply asked that the county highlight its religious diversity by giving the major Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha the same billing of Christmas and Rosh Hashanah. The board could have just as easily taken the small step of honoring the Muslim community’s request and listing the Eid al-Adha alongside Yom Kippur (both of which fall on the same day next year), or even gone the extra mile and agreed to add the holiday to the calendar permanently as a means of acknowledging the diversity of faiths within the county. But instead, the board chose to pretend that religious holidays don’t factor into the county’s decisions at all.
Forgoing religious holidays on the school calendar is not a solution. Rather, it only serves as a slap in the face to those who only wish to have their faith equally listed alongside others on the school calendar. Sidestepping the Muslim community’s request for inclusivity by implementing a practice of total exclusivity is not the answer.

Yasmeen – Well, you’re half right on this one.  The Muslim demands to recognize their religious holiday in a United States school district calendar was in fact deserving of a VIRTUAL slap in the face.  I think the citizens of Montgomery County should vote all of the school board members off except for the one sensible board member who voted against this.  
Please feel free to Google my name or find some way on Earth to read my many previous comments on this sad topic that comes up each and every year, but unfortunately more and more lately.  It’s ridiculous.  When will people learn the TRUTH and FACT that colleges and universities, school districts, private companies, public institutions, state governments, etc etc are implementing calendars with holidays that simply mirror FEDERAL HOLIDAYS!  Sorry to break it to the Muslims and Jews and secular ones among us but our Constitution simply grants them (as it should) the right to practice and observe any religion they want… or no religion at all.  That’s it.  However, the history of THIS country is firmly and clearly rooted in Christian theology and Christian deism.  For this very understandable reason, our Federal government specifically observes Christmas.  It is a Federal holiday, as it should be, due to the beliefs and practices of our nations founders.
Why is this a continued problem for people, particularly those who immigrate to this country?!  It’s baffling, if not infuriating and tiresome.  I can not imagine immigrating to Iran or Saudi Arabia, as a Christian, and demanding that if they officially observe Ramadan, they must also observe my Christian holiday.  Nor can I imagine immigrating to Israel, as a Christian, and demanding that if they officially observe Yom Kippur, that they must also observe my Christian holiday.  The hubris displayed by the Muslim community in Montgomery County, as well as other groups elsewhere, is truly astonishing.
My position needs no religious defense.  This can be argued on a secular, intellectual level.  There is a reason my company in the United States observes Christmas and not these holidays, and it begins and ends with history itself.  Why must we rewrite or redact our history in the face of these tiresome and selfish demands!
Yasmeen, Muslims are killing Christians and burning down their churches across the Middle East and Northern Africa.  When are you going to speak out against this?
Yasmeen, why is it that in the heart of Islam, Saudi Arabia, it is illegal to wear a cross in public?

Javier Bolden was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole Monday for his role in the April 11, 2012, murders of Ming Qu and Ying Wu, 23-year-old graduate engineering students who were shot while sitting in a parked car near the University Park campus.
Last month, a jury convicted Bolden of first-degree murder. 
In a victim impact statement before the sentencing, Ming Qu’s father, Wanzhi Qu, speaking via a translator, called Bolden and Bryan Barnes, his accomplice in the killings, “evil specimens” and “human trash.” 
During sentencing, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stephen A. Marcus called the case one of the saddest he’s presided over and criticized Bolden, 22, for his lack of remorse throughout the trial. He said Bolden was smiling when the jury verdict was read and smiled again during the victim impact statement. 
“Your actions are cowardly and shameful,” Marcus said. “There are no words to express the loss suffered by the parents and friends of Ming Qu and Ying Wu. They were innocent victims of this urban violence set in motion by Mr. Bolden.”
Bolden was the second to be convicted in the shooting. In February, Barnes pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
Bolden’s family did not speak to the press. When exiting the courtroom, his mother told the media to “get the f–k out of here.”
In a statement to the press after sentencing, Wanzhi Qu said via translator that his family and the family of Ying Wu suffered a great deal both mentally and physically as a result of their children’s deaths. 
“Both of our families have spent our lives supporting our kids so they could continue their education in America,” Qu said. “This tragedy caused all our hope to vanish into thin air along with the lives of our children.”
Bolden was also convicted of attempted murder and assault with a firearm in a separate shooting, which occurred in February 2012 at a South Los Angeles banquet hall. He was sentenced to a consecutive term of life in prison for the attempted murder with an additional nine years for the assault. Bolden’s lawyer has already filed a motion to appeal. 
Following the deaths of Qu and Wu and a separate shooting that occurred on Halloween in 2013, USC administrators instituted new security measures, including the stipulation that students entering campus between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. are required to show their student ID at eight of the 27 entrances that remain open. The university also added new security and license plate recognition cameras and hired additional security personnel to monitor the gates during the restricted hours. These personnel also provide 24-hour security in the on-campus residential halls where students are required to scan their fingerprint to gain entry to the building. 
On Monday, the Dept. of Public Safety also launched the mobile safety application LiveSafe, which will allow students to report emergencies or send tips about safety hazards.
Friends of Qu and Wu hope to raise money for the victims’ families.
“They’ve spent a lot of money flying between USC and China, so we want to try our best to raise some money for them,” said Xu Yuan, president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association.
A separate restitution hearing for Bolden is scheduled for Feb. 19, 2015.

UPDATE, Nov. 17, 3:48 p.m.: This story has been updated to include comment from Alpha Tau Omega National Fraternity CEO Wynn Smiley and Vice Provost for Student Affairs Dr. Ainsley Carry.
USC will withdraw its recognition of the Zeta Beta chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity for five years according to a press release issued Monday by Interfraternity Council President Tanner Sandoval.
“The decision was made as a result of an extensive investigation conducted by the University’s Title IX office,” Sandoval said in the press release.
Alpha Tau Omega’s national CEO Wynn Smiley elaborated on the allegations of sexual assault levied against Alpha Tau Omega’s Zeta Beta chapter in a press release issued Monday.
In the press release, Smiley cited two separate incidents of alleged sexual assault in 2013 and 2014, stating that the Title IX office could not establish “a preponderance of the evidence that the member violated the [USC Student Code of Conduct] provisions.” In the 2014 case, however, the Title IX office did find that a member of Alpha Tau Omega violated the USC Student Code of Conduct, resulting in the university’s decision to withdraw recognition of the fraternity’s chapter at USC.
“We’re currently assessing all our options with the university, and trying to be fair with all our members,” Smiley said in an interview. “We believe that the process was filled with procedural inconsistencies, [and] that one person acted as judge, jury and executioner.”
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Dr. Ainsley Carry responded to Smiley’s allegations by citing that the Title IX investigation process has remained unchanged through both the 2013 and 2014 incidents.
“That is not true … There is a Title IX investigation. The Title IX coordinator oversees [the] outcome and then that outcome goes to an appeals panel, called the Student Behavior Appeals Panel,” Carry said. “The appeals panel is made up of three individuals: two faculty members and one staff member, that review all of the information collected and they render the information which comes to the Vice President for Student Affairs for a thorough review of all the recommendations and the finalization of the decision. There are multiple parties involved in this process.”
Smiley also said any questions of the housing accommodations for ATO house residents for the remainder of the semester were “premature.” Carry, however, stated that a process for providing housing for members of the fraternity is already underway.
“There’s a transition plan being worked out with the ATO leadership here, with our student leaders and our fraternity and sorority leadership office and Dr. Monique Allard,” Carry said. “I’m not sure what the national office is aware of or not aware of on the ground, but we’re working with the student leadership and the advisor of the organization to make sure there’s a smooth process for their transition.”
The CEO of Alpha Tau Omega National Fraternity went on to state in his press release that USC was punishing an entire group for the actions of a single student.
“USC is focusing its considerable and direct punitive power at nearly 110 of its own students who are members of the ATO chapter,” Smiley said in the press release. “At least 109 of the students had no involvement with the allegations and yet are being severely punished by the University.”
Without making reference to Smiley’s statements specifically, Carry justified the University’s procedures, stating that allegations of sexual misconduct have an impact beyond the individuals involved.
“One person could violate a policy where multiple people have to pay for it,” Carry said. “If individual members violate the code, it has an impact on everyone. It has an impact on our entire Greek system, not just a house … With regard to that particular incident, [Smiley] has the right to make that allegation and be concerned about that, but it’s not uncommon for individual misconduct to impact many people.”
