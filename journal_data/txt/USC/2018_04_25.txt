SiriusXM and Live Nation have joined forces to put on the cross-country Advanced Placement tour, and they’ve tagged some deserving artists for the promotion. On Friday, the tour will touch base in downtown Los Angeles at the Resident, featuring singer Mikky Ekko and Australian-bred trio Mansionair. Both deserving, high-energy performers in their own right, their combined showcases should make for an exciting night of music, featuring elements that anyone can get behind.

Mikky Ekko already has one claim to superstar fame under his belt, impressing with his feature on Rihanna’s 2012 hit “Stay.” Since then, the Nashville-based singer has been steadily releasing material to keep his name on the upswing, most recently in the form of his EP “Advance Copy” which dropped days before the start of the tour. The intro song, “What’s It Like Now,” has taken off as a success with its swirling guitars and fast-paced, thumping rhythm, which should easily translate into an exhilarating showing at the Resident this Friday.
Ekko was originally born in Louisiana, where he soaked plenty of soul in the form of gospel music influenced by his preacher father. His career took off once he relocated to Nashville, where he developed his noisy, alternative rock sound. He’s made quick work of traveling the globe and recording in locations such as Los Angeles and London, but chose to return home to record his sophomore album Fame, which is anticipated sometime this year.
His debut album Time was released back in 2015, and made a splash, revealing him an artist with the potential to climb the ranks in the coming years. When it comes to songwriting, Ekko prioritizes the vibe and the feeling before dropping in lyrics to fit the mood, allowing him to create a versatile project that dips between various styles. The upbeat “Love You Crazy” successfully contrasts more stripped-down, acoustic songs like “Comatose,” allowing for an engaging listen-through from start to finish. 
Mansionair’s intricately textured sound is also sure to go over well on the tour, filling the entirety of the venue with an avalance of sounds to overwhelm the fans. The band first came together in 2014, when guitarist Lachlan Bostock and drummer Alex Nicholls reached out to singer Jack Froggatt to help finish the music they’d already been working on. Their skills complemented each other well, and their instant chemistry pushed them to make their new band a permanent reality. Their pulsating track “Easier” highlights their cinematic production, enveloping the listener into a massive, distorted soundscape behind lyrics that speak about a feeling of uncertainty in the face of life’s blistering pace. 
The group has done all this without releasing a full album, instead relying on singles, remixes and EPs to get them to this point. Earlier in April they released “Violet City,” which contains a steadily rising beat that falls into a smooth breakdown on the chorus. Their live show is known to create a mesmerizing ambiance while often featuring some unreleased material, giving fans in attendance the opportunity to be ahead of the musical curve.
A hybrid venue that also offers a beer garden and plenty of visual attractions to make the experience, the Resident is an optimal location for the Los Angeles stop of the tour. The three-story building features both indoor and outdoor settings, while also including space dedicated to rotating food trucks to bring more of the local culture to every event. It should all come together nicely on Friday, for an audible experience that attendees likely will not regret. Doors for the event will open at 6:30, while Mikky Ekko will take the stage at 10:30.

When I began writing my column this semester, I didn’t tell my parents. I didn’t tell a lot of people. I was afraid that those I knew personally would read my innermost thoughts and judge me for how messy I sounded on paper. Originally, I contemplated churning out social commentary on my favorite internet memes as the subject of these bi-weekly installments because it seemed like a safe topic to write about. However, deep down, I knew I wanted to share my life lessons even if it meant being painfully vulnerable. I didn’t want to sacrifice the opportunity of facing my fears because it’s uncomfortable.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
I was always hesitant while drafting my work. Was I glorifying my angst too much? Did I sound constantly afflicted and painfully self-centered? Was I oversharing a part of myself that would be better kept private? My intent wasn’t to bury my doubts. In fact, quite the opposite happened. I kept going in spite of my fears of exposing myself. I held on to some hope that by chance, the life lessons I had picked up in the process of making a mess could help someone. I originally challenged myself to write these words as a way to be more upfront. I wanted to prove to myself that I could accept my insecurities by presenting them in a constructive way, and I wondered if others could relate.
My parents found out mid-semester. A family friend had happened to read my column one morning and emailed my mom saying, “You probably knew about this already, but you should be proud of your daughter!” Then my co-workers found the pieces and asked me why I was writing about them. I even received emails in my inbox and DMs from strangers telling me that they had stumbled upon the column online while sipping their morning coffee and somehow the words resonated with them.
Perhaps beyond chronicling the development of self-discovery, I yearned to connect with others. Writing was the only way I knew how to do so, and, miraculously, I was blessed to receive just that through the encouragement and feedback I’ve gotten over the past few months. Though I was once apprehensive, I’m now incredibly grateful for the connections I’ve made and the people who have reached out to me regarding my column.
It doesn’t feel like it’s been an entire semester. A difficult part of writing was ending each piece. Yet, here we are. This is my last column, and I’m struggling to neatly tie up loose ends. I feel pressured to suggest that I have reached some sort of conclusive epiphany to wrap up my thoughts. But I don’t have everything under control outside of my writing, as much as I’d like to give the image of this. Life is ongoing, and I can’t separate the Old Bonnie from the New Bonnie, who I’d like to wistfully imagine as a completely changed and improved person, who is writing about her past in retrospect. But that’s not true. If there’s anything I’ve learned, it’s that life is often complicated and that it’s ok to not have a Plan B.
Through this column I’ve found my voice both in print and real life. I finally had my first real heart-to-heart with my mom, something I never had the guts to do throughout my adolescence. I was also honest with the guy I liked. Writing this column didn’t just give me a platform to share my perspective, it also gave me the courage to have authentic, verbal discussions with people — discussions I originally only knew how to have through pen and paper. And maybe that, in and of itself, is another step toward facilitating growth.
So thank you for keeping up with me this semester. Thank you for reading what I have to say and for the support you’ve shown. We have so much time ahead of us to learn and change. To make friends and lose them. To try something new and venture out of the safety of our comfort zones. To shoot for the dream job or talk to that one person. We’re in college. We’re not finished, but we’re certainly not alone in this process.

When Can Ozan Oguz, a graduate student pursuing his Ph. D. in mathematics, was approached by an undergraduate student wondering what he spent his time doing as a mathematician, he was not sure how to respond.
Wanting He | Daily Trojan
“I’m like, well, it is not that easy to explain … because math has its own language and it keeps building upon itself,” Oguz said. “I realized they had no idea what kind of mathematics is being done in our graduate school or in the upper-division classes.”
Oguz, who works on categorification, quantum algebras and representation theory, decided to create Math Festival, an event that takes place in April where students of all majors can learn more about what kind of problems advanced mathematicians think about.
In collaboration with other graduate students, Oguz hosted USC’s fourth annual Math Festival at the Viterbi E-Quad on Wednesday where students could interact with five booths featuing activities demonstrating different branches of mathematics, including algebra, probability, geometry, combinatorics and topology. 
Ezgi Kantarci Oguz, a student pursuing a Ph. D. in mathematics and Oguz’s wife, studies shifted combinatorics and specializes in counter-examples. She created different puzzles and games for people to attempt to solve at her combinatorics booth. 
“To me, mathematics is that fun, playful thing that sometimes evades you and you have to catch it and try to find the answer,” Kantarci Oguz said. “It’s always entertaining and exciting and I wanted to be able to share that with the students.”
Kantarci Oguz said she enjoys interacting with the different people that come by her table and that a lot of people “hang out” and try to solve her puzzles. 
Elizabeth Zhou, a freshman majoring in physics and computer science, said she grew up participating in math competitions and was excited to attend Math Fest.
“Sometimes in class when people talk about math it seems like very abstract concepts,” Zhou said. “To actually see them applied and interact with the physical world is really interesting.”
Oguz said he hopes this festival can help students who may be interested in taking upper-division math classes by exposing them to the kinds of problems each branch of math deals with. He believes it is beneficial for people of all majors to be exposed to math beyond their required courses. 
“It is difficult to identify what kind of thinking tools one needs when they encounter a new problem,” Oguz said. “This is usually what mathematicians do; they start thinking about a problem before such a problem occurs in the real world so you are ready when such a problem occurs.”

Over 100 games designed by the students from the USC Games Program, a collaboration between the School of Cinematic Arts and the Viterbi School of Engineering, will be showcased at the inaugural USC Games Expo on May 9. Hosted by the mobile game developer Jam City at the Cinematic Arts Complex, the event will expose attendees to the rise of mobile gaming.

Recognized as one of the top game design programs in the United States by The Princeton Review, the USC Games Program has a history of promoting student-developed projects. One of the games that will be presented is Friendshrimp, a single-player, 3-D third-person adventure game. The game revolves around the antics of a mantis shrimp that assists employees at an aquarium with capturing other “rogue shrimp.” 
“The game is narration based with a humorous voiceover, instructing or cautioning the shrimp on how to progress through the game, and reacting as his advice is heeded or ignored,” Friendshrimp executive producer and co-lead engineer Arshea Bimal said. 
With the expo’s collaboration with Jam City, students will have the chance to work closely with experts in the gaming industry to perform demos of the games they have worked on throughout the past school year. 
Bimal is currently enrolled in “CSCI 529: Advanced Games,” which requires students to put together a yearlong master’s capstone project. Students taking the class develop their own games, and the launch of the Game Expo provides them with a platform to present their work.
“It’s one of the longest and most detailed game development classes in the computer science games department,” said Bimal, a computer science graduate student.
Additionally, students enrolled in “CSCI 526: Mobile Games,” “CSCI 524: Networked Artificial Intelligence” and “ITP 485: Programming Games Engines” will also have games on display to demonstrate the engineering aspect of the expo. Projects across disciplines like business and communication will also have the opportunity to be showcased.
“There will be all kinds of other projects,” USC GamePipe Laboratory Director Mike Zyda said. “We have our yearlong advanced games lab, we have the cinematic arts interactive media program, we have students from the computer science games program, we have students from the Marshall School of  Business MBA program, we have students from the Annenberg Communications management program. The Games Expo encompasses all games efforts on campus.”
According to Zyda, students who develop games through the “Advanced Games” class have the benefit of a year’s worth of input and design. Other student projects, however, were selected based on their projected level of completion by the date of the Game Expo.
“As a professor, you know which games are the best,” Zyda said. “We try and invite our best, and our students when they know that they are going to be demoing in front of large numbers of industry people, they work hard to make the games look fantastic.”
Zyda said he is worried that attendees may be overwhelmed with the number of games on display, but the Game Expo’s proximity to graduation will attract a broad audience for developers to demo them.
“Students will bring their parents,” Zyda said. “Large numbers of industry people will come, many of our past students as well.”
As a student in the “Networked Artificial Intelligence” class, Yunxiang Fei, a computer science and electrical engineering graduate student, hopes the large body of onlookers will take time to view his game, Aniki Fight, on display and gain from it. 
“[We will show] the [artificial intelligence] part of our game as well as some specific features,” Fei said. “[Then] the audience can feel even [a] little game may have lots of things to be accomplished.” 
According to Bimal, everyone participating in the event — and her team, in particular — is looking forward to engaging different perspectives when they have attendees demo Friendshrimp.
“The Game Expo is a good way expose our game to a lot of people,” Bimal said. “We’re hoping to get a lot of great feedback on our game.”

USC administration appointed Laura Mosqueda to be the dean of the Keck School of Medicine as of May 1, Provost Michael Quick said in a memorandum sent to faculty, staff and Keck students. She is the first woman to be named dean of Keck since the school was established in 1885.

Since October last year, Mosqueda has served as the interim dean of Keck. She will hold the May S. and John H. Hooval Dean’s Chair. 
According to the memo, Mosqueda was chosen for her leadership over the past six months as interim dean. 
“We sought input from members of the Keck School community, including department heads, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and administrators, who responded with overwhelming support for Dr. Mosqueda’s efforts in the last six months,” Quick said in the memo. “They praised the stability and continuity she managed and the positive tone she set for the future.” 
Mosqueda obtained her medical degree from USC and serves as a professor of family medicine and geriatrics. 
Prior to becoming interim dean, she served as the associate dean of primary care, and the chair of the department of family medicine at Keck, according to the memo. 
Mosqueda is widely known as an expert in elder abuse and family medicine. 
She founded the first Elder Abuse Forensic Center in 2003, and now directs the National Center on Elder Abuse. 
“We know that Dr. Mosqueda will continue working with the entire Keck community and the community at large to build an inclusive and diverse environment … and to advance the educational mission of the School as our students seek to improve local and global health in the 21st century,” Quick said in the memo.
Mosqueda is the third dean to head USC’s school of medicine in as many years. 
Former Keck dean Carmen Puliafito resigned in 2016. His resignation was followed by a Los Angeles Times report in 2017 that Puliafito engaged in drug-related misconduct during his term as dean. 
His successor, former Keck dean Rohit Varma, resigned in October, less than a year after he was officially named dean. 
Varma’s resignation came shortly after the Los Angeles Times reported that USC disciplined Varma in 2003 for allegedly sexually harassing a researcher while he was a junior professor.

Yale, Stanford and Harvard — these are just three of the elite schools that the USC Bovard Scholars Program has assisted low-income, high-achieving high school students from across the nation in getting into.
A group of 2017 Bovard Scholars join Vice President for Strategic and Global Initiatives Anthony Bailey (left) and Provost Michael Quick (right) at a reception to close out their residential program at USC. Photo courtesy of USC News.
The USC Bovard Scholars Program launched its first set of applications in November 2016 to admit 50 qualified high school juniors from low-income families. According to Jennifer Colin, the executive director of summer programs, the Bovard Scholars Program was established to combat “under-matching” and give students the aid that more affluent peers receive when applying to top-tier institutions. 
With access to resources like college counseling and advising, high-income students can apply to a selection of reach, target and safety institutions for their undergraduate education.
However, according to a study on the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, a vast majority of low-income, yet high-achieving students have limited themselves by only applying to non-selective schools due to financial restrictions. 
Colin said the program seeks to admit students who have challenged themselves in academic coursework, showed leadership skills and are ranked near the top of their class. The average GPA of applicants is 4.22, and 96 percent are first-generation college students. 
According to Emily Guzman, a Bovard Scholar attending Yale University next semester, the program has not only impacted her educational trajectory, but also helped her realize her capabilities and limitations. 
“To look beyond my own socioeconomic background, and to look beyond preconceived notions I had about myself, to push myself to be better, to dream bigger … I did not have the financial resources to be able to afford SAT training,” Guzman said. “I think that if it were not for the USC Bovard Scholars Program, I would not have had any sort of preparation and it really allowed my score to improve. And I think it is really important for people who are limited by finances to explore opportunities that would not be given had they not attended the program.”
Betsayda Puerta, a Bovard Scholar attending Stanford University next semester, also noted how the lack of affordable resources prevents students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds from realizing their full potential. Puerta said she is grateful for the opportunities that the program has provided her. 
“I didn’t really have any knowledge on the college application process,” Puerta said. “I didn’t really know the logistics of how to apply, what to write about. So I was kind of lacking in that aspect. That is where the Bovard Scholars stepped in and filled the void … I was able to learn about top-tier universities that I deserve to apply to … the program gave me a newfound confidence in myself and my ability to go to those schools.”
According to the program’s website, in addition to financial aid support, the program also offers a wide range of initiatives, such as a three-week immersive residential experience on USC’s campus, standardized test-taking strategy training and personalized career exploration to aid with the application process. 
According to Puerta, the residential experience is especially helpful in allowing scholars to bond and relate to each others’ struggles and career ambitions. By living in dorms together, Puerta said students can gain exposure to the college lifestyle, diverse cultures and humble upbringings. During the three weeks, students cultivate a community within the group that empowers them and forms lifelong bonds. 
“I think that the Bovard Scholars Program really tried to replicate what a college experience is like,” Puerta said. “My parents never really had the resources to send me away … I was surrounded by first generation college students … a diverse honors student body was a new experience for me, because my community is [predominately] Latino.”
For Guzman, meeting scholars through the residential initiative was an experience that connected her back to her African American roots and expanded her knowledge of other ethnic cultures.
“These things are unspoken, but we know why we are so driven — it is because of our backgrounds,” Guzman said. “I had never really seen so many African American people in my life personally … The program has really allowed me to look at people with different eyes … I understand how people of different colored skins have more have more common than we think.”
According to Colin, the program will continue to expand to reach more students in need of financial aid and career guidance across the nation. Admissions staff for the Bovard Scholars Program are currently reaching out to college counselors at Title 1 schools nationwide and communicating directly with students that fit the program’s profile. 
“[We] provide the intensive admission support or campus experience that is at the heart of our program,” Colin said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
Guzman said she sees the program as a hopeful avenue for students of low socioeconomic upbringings to compete with peers who are receiving additional support on a level playing field. 
“I think also with time news will spread through the word of mouth,” Guzman said. “As soon as I got back from the program, I told my school counselor, ‘You need to make sure that other kids apply to this [program] next year.’ I think that it is really important for us to keep reminding people that there is the USC Bovard Scholars Program out there to help us.”

Ever since her friend’s brother died at 13 years old from a brain tumor, alumna Sophia Wix has had a passion for cancer research. 
Alumna Sophia Wix received the Fulbright Open Study Award this year, an honor given to just two American scholars each year. Photo courtesy of Sophia Wix.
She’s worked in a lab since she was 16 years old, doing research at the Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix, Ariz.
Now, Wix, who graduated from USC with a bachelor’s degree in health and human sciences in December, is the first Trojan in University history to receive the coveted Fulbright Open Study award in the United Kingdom. 
Only two students from the United States are selected for this honor every year. 
Wix has been interested in becoming a Fulbright Scholar since she was in the fourth grade. She was inspired by her cousin, who studied ballet in Germany. 
Wix has been working toward receiving her Fulbright fellowship since her freshman year at USC. 
“The mission [of Fulbright] really resonated with me because it’s all about service and leadership [and] about cross-cultural exchange and sharing of ideas and about ambassadorial potential,” Wix said. “Having been selected as a Fulbright Scholar has really helped open my eyes to know what a strong country we have and how much we have to learn from other nations.”
Wix was awarded her fellowship to research proteomics, or studies of protein sets, of breast cancer subtypes to improve diagnostics and precision treatments. 
She will be pursuing a Master of Philosophy in Medical Science at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute under Carlos Caldas. Wix said she was amazed by Caldas’ work when she saw him present his research at an American Association for Cancer Research conference. 
Wix has worked under the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences research professors James Hicks and Peter Kuhn in their laboratory developing the proteomics of circulating tumor cells, which allow scientists to analyze cancer cells at their protein levels and understand how a tumor interacts with the entire body. 
Hicks was impressed with Wix’s maturity and commitment to science, and said she was more of a colleague than a student. 
“She stood out as a forthright person who was passionately dedicated to the concept of science,” Hicks said. “That’s what drives us to stay in academia [and] to pursue translational clinical science where the rewards are much less than they might be in other fields. You just [have] to have that in your nature.” 
Hicks said Wix’s combination of academic achievements and her ability to present herself professionally differentiated her from the competition, as Fulbright is focused on the diplomatic relationship as well.
“I fell in love with this kind of research [in] translational medicine and the power of genomics to transform personalized and precision medicine,” Wix said.
Wix said she is nervous because there is a lot to live up to, but that she hopes to give back to those who have helped her get to this point in her career. 
“I hope to change the world [and] I hope to cure cancer; I’m not afraid to say it,” Wix said. “It sounds ambitious but this is the purpose of my life and if Fulbright is the next step for that then I’m tremendously honored.”

As the semester comes to a close with the last week of instruction, we are approaching the dreaded week of final exams. But in the coming days, students will also have the opportunity to assess their professors and evaluate the quality of the courses they have sat through all semester. 
The new course evaluation procedure implemented at the end of this semester — which will now be referred to as “learning experience” evaluations  — will ask students to respond to an online questionnaire while the professor steps out of the classroom. When 80 percent of students have responded to the evaluation form, the professor will be allowed to step back in. 
If these really are learning experience evaluations, they should be available to other learners. While the course evaluation system is primarily designed for professors to improve their teaching, there is undeniable value in having other students see how their peers rate certain courses. Therefore, the responses of the course evaluations should be accessible to all USC students. Some reports indicate USC used to have these numbers available in a database on MyUSC in the early 2000s, but this is no longer the case.
The course evaluation form assesses course design, instructional practices, inclusion practices, assessment practices and course impact on multiple choice scales and through short answers. Publishing the percentage of students who respond with each option allows for a scaled version of responses that students interested in the course should be able to access. 
There is an opportunity for students to provide detailed feedback to their instructors. But of course, students’ written comments should remain private for professors to review. According to Vice Provost of Academic and Faculty Affairs Elizabeth Graddy, some students write “disturbing” comments in these evaluations since they know they are anonymous. Making these comments public would not benefit anyone. But there is no such danger with publicizing multiple choice evaluation questions. 
There will always be an element of bias when it comes to course evaluations. This same bias exists on the infamous RateMyProfessors.com, a website that gives students a platform to evaluate their professors. Undoubtedly, students who earn higher grades will rate the class higher than students who receive poor grades. 
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
UCLA’s student newspaper, the Daily Bruin, implemented its own system — BruinWalk — to bypass this problem. Founded in 1998, the BruinWalk website includes the grade distributions, as provided by the registrar, for each course and for each professor who teaches that course. With this information, students can track grading tendencies and factor this in alongside course evaluation ratings. 
USC should implement a similar system. The numbers students assign to a professor’s effectiveness, clarity of expectation, difficulty and availability outside of class would be immensely helpful for students as they look to build their course schedules for future semesters. 
Perhaps these ratings might incentivize professors to read their evaluations and take them to heart. While most of my professors have said they care deeply about their evaluations, there is no way of verifying if they actually open them at all. Tenured professors with job security have even less incentive to read student opinions about their courses. 
But the focus for publishing course evaluations should not only be on professors; it should also be for the students. Instead of having students pick their courses based on RateMyProfessors, a site where one poor review can damage a professor’s rating due to the sometimes incredibly small sample size, consistent publication of USC students’ responses would give students an accurate sense of a professor’s teaching style. 
The evaluation forms would continue helping professors improve their classroom skills, and the written comments students provide in their evaluations would give specific feedback. But the scaled values can benefit students just the same. At the end of the day, while we often forget this due to the amount of coursework we have, professors work for students — not the other way around.

Sonali Seth | Daily Trojan
As students found out this week, USC’s teacher evaluations — now rebranded as “learning experience” evaluations — have undergone some changes. Evaluations are administered in class, where faculty members must leave while a student proctor is tasked with ensuring an 80 percent response rate. The evaluations are longer, with more specific questions regarding the course and the professor in five different areas: Course Design, Instructional Practices, Inclusion Practices, Assessment Practices and Course Impact. They also play a reduced role in faculty performance reviews.
These are welcome changes: They are in step with cutting-edge research that has shown college students are not authorities in pedagogy, and that specificity in course evaluations can improve the learning experience.
The new system, however, has led some to question whether course evaluations should be published for future students to read. It’s not a new idea: Daily Trojan opinion columnists have proposed such a publishing mechanism in 2009 and 2012. However, creating a USC-specific system like the popular teacher-evaluation website, RateMyProfessors, would accentuate the negative parts of student evaluations while sidestepping their actual benefits.
Such a system would aggravate the role of implicit bias toward female faculty and faculty of color in student evaluations. A 2015 study in Innovative Higher Education conducted an experiment in which an instructor operated under two gender identities; even though the instructor was the same in both classes, students rated the teacher significantly higher when identifying as a man than when identifying as a woman. Another study from North Carolina State University found that students gave professors with  female-sounding names lower scores than professors with male-sounding names, even though they were taught by the same professor in an online class.
Northeastern University professor Benjamin Schmidt created a searchable database of the reviews from RateMyProfessors, which found that descriptors like “brilliant,” “smart” and “funny” appeared more often in reviews of male professors, while “strict,” “sweet,” “shrill” and “beautiful” appeared more often in reviews of female professors. 
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
“In short … men are more likely to be judged on an intelligence scale, while women are more likely to be judged on a nurturing scale,” NPR radio host William Huntsberry wrote of the study.
Bias isn’t limited to just women. A 2005 study published in the Economics of Education Review found that students consistently gave lower ratings to teachers who are non-native English speakers, while a 1991 study by researchers Jai Ghorpade and James Lackritz found that faculty of color received lower ratings than white professors teaching the same course. 
Reducing the importance of student evaluations to determine teaching effectiveness is a crucial step toward lowering barriers faced by female faculty and faculty of color. And while the changes in the student evaluation policy hope to reduce the role of implicit bias in student evaluations, publishing reviews for future students to read would only perpetuate the gender and racial stereotypes that female faculty and faculty of color already face. Moreover, it could undo much of the progress that the new evaluation system has engendered: If students are already biased toward professors — before they even meet them — by reading online reviews, they might be less motivated to do the work, to expose themselves to a new teaching style or to give the professor a fair shake. 
As of 2016, only 37.5 percent of tenured faculty are women, and just 8 percent are women of color. Achieving parity in higher education faculty is already a massive challenge. Let’s not make it harder.
I will end my last Daily Trojan column by noting that the best classes I’ve taken here have been classes that ended up in my course registration basket by chance. Given USC’s diverse faculty, exhibiting confirmation bias by taking professors that already match our personality profiles means missing out on valuable learning opportunities. Students have a role to play in allowing our professors to understand how they can be better. But let’s not allow our peers to determine our experience. We have our own academic paths to forge — and the opportunities to shape them. I couldn’t be happier that this is the one I chose.

Kylie Cheung | Daily Trojan
A couple weeks ago, my favorite feminist writer Rebecca Solnit published an essay about the politics of, as she put it, “who gets to be the subject of the story.” “Whose Story (and Country) Is This?” dismantles a trove of political talking points and cultural tropes that regard the “forgotten American” as the white, male, heartland evangelical. All of it resonates with anyone who is liberal, hails from a coastal city and is subsequently told their opinions don’t matter because they are “out of touch.” But to me, the most striking portion of the essay is her discussion of prioritizations of male perspective, even in media dialogues centered around the women-led #MeToo movement.
“The follow-up story to the #MeToo upheaval has too often been: How do the consequences of men hideously mistreating women affect men’s comfort? Are men OK with what’s happening?” Solnit wrote. “There have been too many stories about men feeling less comfortable, too few about how women might be feeling more secure in offices where harassing co-workers may have been removed.”
Male comfort is, as Solnit points out, regarded as a right. But more than that, it is the default around which all systems and institutions are built, and the consequences of this have been vast. 
We understand #MeToo as arising from the systemic exclusion of women from positions of power, opening the door for exploitation in myriad forms and the shielding of that exploitation behind a smokescreen of mass male complicity. Male dominance in spaces of power has resulted in authority, experience and competence being gendered male in our cultural consciousness. This dominance has created the gender wage gap and a disproportionate relationship between women and poverty; it’s commodified violence against women by denying victims of abuse platforms and assurances of safety to come forward about their experiences. 
And coverage of #MeToo is also, as Solnit points out, a reflection of the extent to which male dominance is not only ingrained but also regarded as the default. The movement is changing women’s lives and fostering a consciousness of the oppression women have always been conditioned to accept as a fact of life. So, why is male comfort and some local men’s dramatized confusion about whether it’s OK to hug women soaking up so much attention?
I can’t help but think the physical exclusion of women is, in some ways, just the tip of the iceberg. Greater inclusivity of women in key roles and more influential positions makes a crucial difference, but we’re not just excluding women — we’re also excluding their authentic experiences, conditions and feelings from our collective recognition of what is valid and what isn’t through systemic gaslighting.
Our mistreatment of women’s health is rife with examples of this. Studies have shown migraines are three times more likely to affect women than men, but as articles like the 2015 Atlantic piece, “How Doctors Take Women’s Pain Less Seriously,” and the 2013 New York Times op-ed, “The Gender Gap in Pain,” argue, notions of feminine hypersensitivity and exaggeration have created systemic inequality in whose pain is taken seriously. This has made access to care an inherently gendered issue. As the Atlantic piece notes, “Women are likely to be treated less aggressively until they prove that they are as sick as male patients.”
Migraines can be debilitating; they can cause affected individuals to miss work for days at a time. The inequalities that deny women quality medical attention and care can also subsequently perpetuate gendered economic inequality.
Di Wu | Daily Trojan
The crisis of gaslighting in women’s health predictably extends to reproductive rights. In January, the complications surrounding Serena Williams’ delivery served as a reminder of the dangerous landscape around prenatal and maternal health care for black women. According to reporting from ProPublica, black women are 243 percent more likely than white women to die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes, and it’s widely understood that racism — not some nebulous, biological attributes of race — is a driving factor. It’s critical to note how the trivialization of women’s pain and experiences is exacerbated across intersectional lines. And as in nearly all cases, women of color are still receiving the shorter end of the stick, and quite literally dying because of this.
Speaking more broadly, the landscape around abortion and reproductive health care has become increasingly dangerous as well. More than 1,050 restrictions on abortion have been enacted since 1973, and 27 percent of those restrictions were enacted between 2011 and 2016 alone. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the industrialized world, and states with the most restrictions have higher mortality rates. But the conversation has remained largely limited to the technical legal status of abortion in this country — an oversimplification that erases many women’s lived experiences with being unable to access a medical service that is their human right.
Will better representation of women lead to fewer instances of our pain, oppression and experiences being trivialized? We can only hope so. But our goal has to be greater than that. In addition to creating a society where inclusivity of women is prioritized, we must also create one in which — cliche and oversimplified as it may sound — women’s feelings are prioritized, too. 
I would be remiss to wrap up an academic year that has seen such sweeping change and invigorated conversation around gender without acknowledging that much of this specific column, and “You Do Uterus,” in general, stems from a place of deep frustration and outrage.
I have too many close friends and family members who have been traumatized by sexual violence for me to count on one hand, all while having to listen to men around me qualify tepid support for #MeToo with concerns about how it may purportedly hurt them. I have had far too many personal experiences being harassed, groped or otherwise mistreated to still be subjected to debates about whether rape culture does, in fact, exist. And for as long as I’ve had opinions and expressed them, I’ve been forced to either accept dismissal of my frustration as the ravings of a perennially angry “social justice warrior,” or just be silent. 
Well, I am angry. Believe it or not, many women are. And it’s time for that anger to be taken seriously, and paid the attention it deserves.

With the NFL Draft starting Thursday, six Trojans wait for their name to be called in Dallas.
Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
This year, as is the case in most years, USC will have an incredibly strong presence at the NFL Draft. In Dallas, six Trojan stars will wait to hear their names called on stage and find out what franchise they will soon call home. 
Quarterback Sam Darnold, running back Ronald Jones II, wideouts Steven Mitchell and Deontay Burnett and pass rushers Rasheem Green and Uchenna Nwosu all participated in the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis and are expected to be among the 256 players selected in the draft.
Where and when these athletes are selected, however, is certainly up for debate.
Sam Darnold is, by a large margin, the most talked about of the bunch. A strong candidate for the first overall pick in the draft, Darnold is all but assured to go within the first few picks. 
With a number of teams — including the Cleveland Browns and New York Giants — interested in picking a quarterback lined up within the top five, most analysts feel it is incredibly unlikely that Darnold will wait long before hearing his name called. According to the latest mock draft released by Bleacher Report, Darnold is projected to come off the board third overall to the New York Jets.
Unfortunately for the other five former USC stars, Darnold is the only Trojan named in this first round mock draft. According to ESPN’s Mel Kiper, the Indianapolis Colts will take Jones within the first few picks of the second round. Fellow Trojans Green and Nwosu are also expected to be taken later in the round within just four picks of each other, according to Kiper’s prognostications.
For the receivers, analysts’ expectations are significantly lower than Jones, Darnold, Green and Nwosu. In the CBS Sports seven-round mock draft, Burnett doesn’t get picked until the sixth round while Mitchell goes the full weekend without hearing his name called. On the bright side for Mitchell, it is notoriously difficult to project picks in the later rounds and his experience as a key contributor to the USC offense over the past four seasons give him a great chance of being drafted.
While many things in the draft are difficult to guarantee beforehand, it is incredibly unlikely that the Trojans’ top prospects, Darnold, Green, Jones and Nwosu, will continue to play in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum next season. With the Los Angeles Rams having to wait until the third round to make a pick, it is likely that the balance of USC prospects will not be available. With that being said, it wouldn’t be too shocking to see at least one of the USC prospects head to play for the Chargers. With one pick in each round and needs on both sides of the ball, it is highly possible that at least one of these talented former Trojans wind up playing professionally in Los Angeles.
Only time will tell what will happen to these six remarkable athletes, but what is certain is that USC and the Trojan fanbase is immensely excited to see what the future holds in store.

After a dominant win over Arizona State University on Saturday, the USC women’s lacrosse team, ranked third in the Pac-12, will travel to Prentup Field in Boulder, Colo., to face off — for their second game in a row — against the Sun Devils in the inaugural Pac-12 Tournament on Thursday. The Trojans hope to continue their success against the sixth-seeded Sun Devils with another commanding victory.

This match will mark the third time this season that the Trojans have faced off against ASU. The Women of Troy are 2-0 against Arizona State so far this year, touting a combined score of 33-5 in those two games.
The Sun Devils have had a rollercoaster of a season. Although it is in the middle of a five-game losing streak, Arizona State started the season well — by winning five of their first six games. Since then, they have cooled down. Arizona State has lost 10 of its last 11 games, ending their inaugural season with a 6-11 record.
Since its inception, the USC women’s lacrosse team, led by head coach Lindsey Munday, has been dominant. Munday, who has been with the program since its beginning, is 78-37 all-time. In previous seasons, USC was a member of the MPSF in which it won the MPSF Tournament in both 2016 and 2017. Now in the Pac-12, the Trojans are ranked No. 20 in the IWLCA coaches poll for the 40th consecutive week and without a doubt have made a strong statement in their new conference.
USC currently has three players on the Tewaaraton Award Watch List including All-American senior goalie Gussie Johns, senior All-Region defender Lydia Sutton, and sophomore midfielder Kerrigan Miller. The award annually honors the top lacrosse player in the United States.
Johns, who leads the nation in ground balls with 76, and Sutton, who earned third-team All-American honors, lead the Trojans’ defense. The two have combined for three Pac-12 defensive player of the week awards this season.
Miller, who put together a 3-goal, two-assist performance last week against the Sun Devils, leads the team in goals and points scored but also has contributed with 10 assists, 41 draw controls and 35 ground balls. Miller, who has been a huge part of the team’s success, picked up the honor of Pac-12 offensive player of the week earlier this season. She also leads the Pac-12 in both caused turnovers per game (2.6) and game-winning goals (4).
Freshman midfielder Kelsey Huff, who matched Miller’s performance against Arizona State with 3 goals and two assists, now sits at 25 goals and five assists this season. Huff should play a large role in Thursday’s matchup. The Trojans will also rely on players like sophomore midfielder Kaeli Huff, who has racked up 27 goals — good for third on the team. Two of those goals came on Saturday against ASU.
Graduate attacker Maeve McMahon will also look to improve upon her already impressive first year as a Trojan. She  has already piled up 15 goals and leads the team with 13 assists. Sophomore attacker Izzy McMahon, who is second on the team in goals scored (28), will need to put up a strong performance Thursday.
A win over the Sun Devils would give the Trojans their fourth-straight 10-win season.
Further, beating Arizona State Thursday would guarantee a berth in the semifinals and a third matchup this season against Stanford, the tournament’s No. 2 seed Stanford, which has put together a dominant season shown by their 13-4 record, defeated the Trojans twice this year. The Trojans have not lost to the Cardinal by more than 3 scores this season and lost to them by 1 in a heartbreaking overtime game on March 25. A rematch should be a nailbiter.

For the first time since opening day, the Trojans have fallen below .500 on the year. Following their home 5-8 defeat at the hands of the Long Beach State Dirtbags on Tuesday, the Trojans now stand at 18-19. It’s been a disappointing stretch for the Trojans, as they’ve lost five of their last six games, all of which have been decided by at least 3 runs.

The Trojans have the chance to get back on the horse with this weekend’s road series against Oregon. As evidenced by their 19-18 record, the Ducks are also a middling team in search of answers. Similarities abound between these teams; the Ducks have lost seven of their last eight games and hold a 6-12 conference record, identical to USC’s.
The comparisons don’t end with the records. Like USC, Oregon struggles mightily at the plate; the Trojans are the only team whose .243 batting average ranks below Oregon’s (.248). There’s little to no separation in hitting statistics between the teams, as both their on base and slugging percentages are within .015 of each other.
If Oregon had an offensive strength, it would be on the base paths. The Ducks rank third in the conference in stolen bases, although they also rank third in attempts. USC, meanwhile, ranks second to last in the Pac-12 in stolen bases allowed. The Trojan pitchers must keep the opposition off base to negate this disadvantage.
Oregon’s best hitter is redshirt junior catcher/outfielder Jakob Goldfarb, whose .523 slugging percentage and 5 home runs lead the team. Goldfarb also ranks second on the team with a .313 batting average. The Ducks don’t have a player in the top 10 in the conference in any hitting statistic, so the Trojan pitchers will have little excuse for poor performances.
Oregon’s pitching isn’t significantly better than their hitting; their 3.87 earned run average ranks sixth in the Pac-12. However, the Ducks strike out a lot of hitters (319) and limit home runs (19), ranking second and tied for third in the conference in those respective areas.
The strength of Oregon’s staff is in the bullpen tag team of junior Parker Kelly and sophomore Kenyon Yovan. Kelly’s 1.67 ERA and Yovan’s five saves lead the team. Yovan and junior starter Matt Mercer are tied for second in the Pac-12 with 60 strikeouts each.
The Ducks’ pitchers are definitely hittable, but with USC’s struggles at the plate, there’s no guarantee the Trojan bats will find any traction this weekend. The X-factor for the Trojans this weekend will be junior left fielder Lars Nootbaar. 
Nootbaar ranks second for the Trojans in homeruns on the year (5), but he hit two homeruns last week, one against LMU and the other against UCLA. Prior to the start of the season, there were high expectations for how Nootbaar would help the team following his impressive last season, in which he batted .313 and had 7 home runs as a sophomore. 
But, Nootbaar has failed to live up to those high expectations this season as he has struggled at the plate, batting .226 on the year. If Nootbaar plays like he did last season and keeps his hot home run streak going, his presence would likely help propel the Trojans to victory this weekend.
The Trojans struggled on the mound last weekend against UCLA, letting up a combined total of 42 runs against the Bruins. Freshman pitcher Kyle Hurt, junior pitcher Solomon Bates and junior pitcher Quentin Longrie all started on the mound over the weekend. Collectively, the Trojans have a 5.56 ERA, the second-worst in the Pac-12, and both the starters and the bullpen have struggled on the mound recently. 
Oregon’s fielding leaves a lot to be desired, as the Ducks rank third to last in the conference with a .973 fielding percentage. They’re also the only team that allows a higher percentage of successful stolen base attempts than USC; the Ducks allow a .769 success rate compared to USC’s .767. 
The games will take place at PK Park in Eugene, Ore., this weekend. Game one will be played on Friday at 6 p.m. and game two will take place on Saturday at 2 p.m. The series’ last game will take place Sunday at noon.

On Tuesday, the USC women’s beach volleyball team continued its preparation to defend its conference title in the upcoming Pac-12 Tournament.
Photo by Ling Luo | Daily Trojan
This regular season was significantly more tumultuous than past years for the No. 5-ranked Trojans, who have lost more duals this season (22-10) than they have in the past four seasons combined. Despite this, the team earned the No. 2 seed for the conference tournament and are coming off a tremendous 3-2 win over No. 6 Long Beach State. The team is now starting to resemble the championship contender it has the potential to be.
“I absolutely feel like this team is hitting its stride,” head coach Anna Collier said. “The partnerships are starting to become twinships and we’re starting to have everything that comes with creating a championship team.”
As an event, the Pac-12 Tournament is a double-elimination gauntlet that requires the winner to win at least four matches in three days. With a title under their belt already, both USC coaching staff and players are prepared for the challenge.
“We’re really excited and we’re trying to enjoy the moment,” said senior Terese Cannon, a two-time champion. “Our plan is to stay in the winner’s bracket and avoid the extra matches that come with trying to reach the championship from the loser’s bracket.”
Cannon has teamed up with freshman Sammy Slater this season and become one of the many elite Trojan duos this season. With a dual record of 21-4, they’ve done most of their work on the third court. Along with USC’s first court pairing of freshman Tina Graudina and junior Abril Bustamante (24-1), they will look to continue to carry the Trojans’ championship aspirations for the remainder of the season.
The first test for the Women of Troy will be against the No. 7 Arizona State Sun Devils (10-18). The two teams previously met in Santa Monica on March 24, resulting in a 4-1 victory for the Trojans. USC also owns the all-time series between the two teams 9-0. Although the Trojans are the heavy favorites to win the match, Collier praised the Sun Devils and wants to ensure her team does not underestimate its competition. 
“[Arizona State] has really good fours and fives,” Collier said. “They’re very scrappy and they come in and play hard. It’s going to be hard to put them away.”
Another important variable to consider over the course of the Pac-12 Tournament is the Trojans’ quest to be selected for the NCAA Tournament. With No. 2 Pepperdine, No. 1 UCLA and No. 3 Hawaii presumably locking up the three bids from the West region, the Trojans will most likely have to earn one of two at-large bids in order to be selected for the tournament. 
The two teams that pose the biggest threat to USC’s selection are No. 4 Cal Poly and No. 6 Long Beach State. Though the Trojans have defeated both squads this season, a strong showing in the Pac-12 Tournament would go a long way in helping them secure their place at Gulf Shores for the Big Dance. 
If the Trojans are going to complete the three-peat as Pac-12 Champions, they will likely have to go through a familiar foe in UCLA. 
“We’re probably going to have to beat UCLA; it’s who I see in the finals,” Collier said. “They’re playing solid ball and it’s going to take a team effort to defeat them and secure the championship.”
USC’s first match against Arizona State will take place on Thursday at 9:45 a.m. and will be broadcast live on the Pac-12 Network.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
The mood was somber on the night of Sept. 23, 2016. USC had fallen to 1-3 for the first time since 2001 after a heartbreaking defeat in Utah. It was pouring rain on a dreary evening at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, and we were crowded in a closet-sized room for the postgame press conference, waiting to hear what Sam Darnold, a redshirt freshman who had just made his first career start at quarterback, had to say.
I felt bad for him, as his 6-foot, 4-inch, 220-pound frame squeezed into that tiny room along with head coach Clay Helton and linebacker Cam Smith, in front of all the cameras. This relatively unknown, quiet kid, thrust into the spotlight as the face of what could be the worst USC team in 15 years, could be in for a long season.
I don’t remember much from that press conference. Darnold, as we would become familiar with, kept it cool and did not look flustered for a 19-year-old making his first career start. I didn’t even quote him in the recap I went on to write.
At the time, it was hard to be positive. Darnold had made some good throws and given his team a chance to win on the road. But the season was destined for a tailspin. This team had lost by 46 to Alabama in the opener and was completely outmatched at Stanford, after which players called each other out for quitting at halftime. Zach Banner, a team captain, declined to speak with the media, and star cornerback Adoree’ Jackson proclaimed that losing was unacceptable, because he didn’t come from a losing program in high school and wasn’t used to this. Helton was very much on the hot seat.
His solution — and likely, his job — depended on this redshirt freshman from San Clemente, a last-ditch effort to salvage the season. If it seemed like desperation, it was desperation.
But then Darnold won his next start. And the next one. And the next 12 after that, highlighted by a Rose Bowl performance for the ages. He sparked the team, probably saved Helton’s job and set up the program for sustained success even as he leaves for the NFL.
Which is where we are at on Thursday: Darnold will be drafted onto an NFL team today, and no matter where that franchise is, he will likely have to repeat what he did at USC. The bad thing about being really good in college is that you will probably get stuck on an awful NFL team (or even worse, in Cleveland). Darnold will have to make do with a bleak situation. He will have to probably save another head coach’s or GM’s job. He will be faced with the pressure of not ending up a bust. All of this — and he doesn’t turn 21 until June.
I’ve covered all of Darnold’s games at USC. I’ve seen him grow into a star — and man, were there cool moments. I’ll never forget when he quieted 72,364 screaming fans at Husky Stadium in Washington — the loudest I’ve ever heard a football stadium — and upset the No. 4 Huskies with some elite throws. There was the game-saving jump pass he made last year to Stephen Carr against Texas in the triple-overtime thriller. And, of course, I still have no idea how he fit that ball into Deontay Burnett’s hands to tie the Rose Bowl. 
Darnold’s career will ultimately be judged by how he fares in the NFL, by whether he turns into a franchise quarterback and lives up to the hype. But I hope we don’t forget his roots and his meteoric rise to the top. I think back to that dreary night in Utah two years ago and I now feel fortunate to have been there. Because that was the start of a legendary collegiate career, and — we’re hoping — so much more to come.

Di Wu | Daily Trojan
We’re angry. 
We’re angry that in a political climate in which newspaper subscriptions are up, trust in institutions is down and critical journalism in just the past year has created social waves and mass movements, universities like Southern Methodist University are choosing to take away the independence of their student newspaper the Daily Campus. 
We’re angry that universities, which purport to stand for ideals like diverse thought and knowledge, suddenly oppose this when it comes from student journalists. 
But mostly, we’re angry that we have to have this debate at all — that student newsrooms are important and worth preserving. Every school deserves an independent student press. We must #SaveStudentNewsrooms.
We, at the Daily Trojan, were reminded of how fortunate we are when the news broke that the Daily Campus would lose its independence and become re-affiliated with the university as a result of financial struggles. As an independent student organization, we are one of a minority of student newspapers in the nation that prints five days a week. Yes, as student editors, we experience grueling production nights, work between 20 and 40 hours in the newsroom each week and occasionally clash with a sometimes adversarial University, but we wouldn’t have it any other way. 
Student newsrooms are voices to power. If we do not have student journalists on campus to ask the difficult questions and hold the University, community leaders and the student body accountable, then we do not have an institution of higher learning at all. The journalism we and campus newspapers across the country produce is important, and it is not up for debate whether universities would be able to be as self-critical without independent student newspapers. Without Syracuse University’s Daily Orange, videos exposing racist practices during a fraternity initiation may have never been published, and the school may have never taken action. Such practices may have continued on indefinitely. Without The Daily Californian, we may have never seen — in live time — the violence and vitriol that erupted when conservative speaker Milo Yiannoupolos came to speak on campus. And without the Daily Trojan, interactions between former USG President Austin Dunn and a conservative nonprofit accused of meddling in student elections, and stories of low-income Exposition Boulevard residents who have been displaced, may have never received public attention.
Student newspapers across the country are not just recording the histories of their schools; they are shaping them and challenging them, striving to make them better. What student journalists do is a public service to students, the university and the general public. And universities, ours included, need to start acting like it. At USC, we are fortunate to have one of the most prominent journalism schools in the world at our disposal — the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. In this past year, the journalism school received a 19 percent spike in applications, with students eager to report on the societal microcosm that is the University. 
And yet, it’s disappointing that the journalism curriculum at Annenberg fails to support student journalists at the Daily Trojan and, consequently, students interested in pursuing a career path in print journalism. Journalism students previously had the option to work either at the Annenberg Media Center or at the Daily Trojan newsroom to fulfill class credit, but about five years ago, the restructured curriculum eliminated that choice, leaving the Media Center — which produces predominantly broadcast and digital content — as students’ only option. As a result, our newsroom has become stretched thin in recent years. For putting out five issues a week, we are severely understaffed. Students who are on our staff and also study journalism are forced to crowd their schedules with work at the Media Center, their course loads, any outside campus work and their work for us in order to report for Daily Trojan. It’s a decision not many students would choose to make, and a concession student journalists shouldn’t have to make. 
And that’s not to say the work done in the Media Center should not be applauded. The student journalism that comes out of Annenberg is comprehensive and has impacted real change at the University. Their newsroom deserves to be preserved just as much as ours, the Daily Campus’ and student newsrooms across the country. But students who are motivated to pursue student journalism and want to work for student media should not be punished or ostracized for not wanting to do so on the University’s — and, specifically, the Annenberg School’s — terms. 
We’ve been told our student newsroom hasn’t changed much in the last 50 years. We occupy the corner office on the fourth floor of the Gwynn Wilson Student Union building, in a direct standoff with the Bovard Administration building that is located across Hahn Plaza. From 5 p.m. until the early hours of the morning, student journalists and editors toil away to create a product we are proud of. Sundays through Thursdays, we are hunched over newspaper proofs and typing away at our computers. We leave the newsroom after the sun has set and most students have long left campus. The building lights are off, Trousdale Parkway is quiet and the Daily Trojan editors scatter. 
Then, unbeknownst to us, at the end of each semester, we finally look up after sending the last issue to the printer. We look around, and we realize that the Daily Trojan is not just a paper — it never was — it’s our family. It’s our community. It’s our newsroom. 
If we stand idly by as our peer publication’s newsroom falls into jeopardy, then we may as well be giving up on our own. And anyone who’s ever met a student journalist knows we never give up. 
We stand in solidarity with the Daily Campus. We stand in solidarity with student journalists across the country. And we will stay standing until we #SaveStudentNewsrooms.

For the last two weeks, Syracuse University has been rocked by the release of a highly offensive video shot at a Theta Tau Fraternity event. The video depicts brothers and pledges performing a skit that features racist and anti-Semitic language, with one performer promising, in character, to “always have hatred in my heart for” black, Hispanic and Jewish people — using explicit racial slurs. The fraternity was permanently expelled, and the 18 students involved have been removed from classes as disciplinary action continues. Other videos from a similar event have surfaced, showing the fraternity members imitating disabled and LGBTQ people in a decidedly demeaning manner.
The Theta Tau Syracuse chapter released an official statement, saying that the original video — the one laden with racial slurs — was part of a skit to make fun of a conservative Republican member. They said that, while this does not excuse the behavior, the context of the video was “a satirical sketch of an uneducated, racist, homophobic, misogynist, sexist, ableist and intolerant person,” and that none of the participants held the hateful beliefs expressed. This context is important, and while the disciplinary action taken against these students should be left to the Syracuse community, the fact that this shocking video was purportedly meant as a piece of satire highlights some common misconceptions about comedy and social commentary.
We are living in an age where comedy and politics are joined at the hip. Most standup comedians do political material; TV schedules are stuffed with comedic news programs like The Daily Show and Last Week Tonight; and The Onion’s satirical news articles go viral on an almost daily basis. Many comedians and fans believe that comedy is a way to attack the powerful and call out misbehavior, and therefore is a tool for social change. And it can create real change — look at the thousands of dollars raised for the ACLU by Samantha Bee or the attention that Stephen Colbert brought to the Citizens United case. 
But when people hear that good comedy can create social change, they often block out the “good” part of the sentence. Because, even though comedy is a rebellious art, there are rules to creating it responsibly. 
The members of Theta Tau fell into a trap that bad comedians so often do — thinking that reproduction is the same as commentary. It seems that their train of thought when writing the skit — if we assume that their apology was genuine — was that they were going to use hateful language to expose the ridiculousness of their conservative peers’ beliefs. They seemed to think that by taking these beliefs to an extreme — in this case, the hatred of racial and religious minorities — they could create comedy, allowing the audience to laugh at the ignorance of this conservative caricature. 
Though the members of Theta Tau claim they were using these sketches to provide criticism of racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia, they only did this by reproducing the hateful language that perpetuates these bigoted views. 
By only parroting the slurs that pervade American racism and anti-Semitism, without any clear point made that these words are wrong and that using them will lead to consequences, their performance served to only normalize hateful behavior in their organization and campus. If the group truly wanted to create social commentary on why racism is wrong, they would need to make their points about this in the same context as their reproduction of racist acts and language. 
The simple act of reproducing something you see as wrong is not satire, and it is not comedy — it is perpetuation, and regardless of your intent, it normalizes the very thing you are seeking to criticize. Theta Tau claims none of its members hold the beliefs expressed in these videos, but the fact that its members so gleefully engaged in performances of “racist, homophobic, misogynist, sexist, ableist and intolerant” behavior, without in any way confronting the inherent wrongness of it, shows they may not have been as politically motivated or well-meaning as they claimed. 
Syracuse’s administration and students will make the decision on what happens to the members of Theta Tau on campus, but their case provides a valuable lesson on the line between smart social commentary and genuinely offensive behavior. In this case, because their attempt at social commentary was so poor, the fraternity’s videos fall firmly in the latter category. Their attempt to call out offensive behavior only served to make it seem normal or acceptable to engage in it, and for that, they are being rightfully punished.

In the past, Coachella fashion was synonymous with cultural insensitivity, but this year, people seem to have finally gotten the memo that feathered headdresses are inappropriate. Of course, while trends have shifted, flower crowns will always be a staple. Here’s a rundown of all the styles spotted at Coachella 2018: 
Coachella merchandise
The Coachella merchandise tent was enormous, stocked with hoodies, t-shirts, tote bags and more, all stamped with the ubiquitous logo, as well as a plethora of items advertising the various artists set to perform. But beware of anyone attired in a shirt emblazoned with a specific artist, because during their show, they will push and shove in order to get to the very front. 
Bandanas 
Sure, it might not go with the rest of your carefully curated outfit, but a bandana is absolutely essential to surviving the weekend without becoming bedridden the next week. The Coachella dust is insidious; the wind isn’t heavy, but the fields are barren and the air is dry, so you don’t even notice the fine particles making their way into your nose and mouth until Monday morning comes around and you’re coughing up a storm. A bandana wrapped around your face makes all the difference, and can always be whipped off when it’s photoshoot time.

Sparkle and shine
Glitter seemed to the be the accent du jour, as people coated their faces, arms, legs and backs in swathes of sparkle. The disco ball craze also extended to outfits, as holographic fabric, shimmering mesh and sequin-encrusted materials were also popular at the festival. 
Sensible shoes
Anyone wearing heels over three inches has already taken them off and is limping around barefoot by the time the sun has set. If your sole purpose in attending Coachella is to flex on the ’gram, then by all means, go ahead and rock those sky-high stilettos. But for those looking to catch a few sets and maybe even dance a little, you’re much better off sporting a pair of Vans, Converse or Nikes. Sandals were also well-represented, but will likely result in bruised toes. 
(Next to) nothing
Coachella is one of the only occasions where it’s socially acceptable to don underwear in public without incurring charges of public indecency, and festival-goers took full advantage of it. The tiniest shorts, a straight-up thong, nothing but pasties — anything goes. For the shy or insecure, a note of reassurance: No one notices a little cellulite when you’re sandwiched in the middle of a mass of sweaty, writhing bodies baking under the relentless desert sun.

Catherine Yang | Daily Trojan
One particular quote from an article by art critic Lauren Elkin, assigned in my art history class last week, really struck me: “It is not the work of art to make us feel safe; if it does, it probably isn’t art at all.” 
This semester, my column has revolved around artworks that are not only unsafe but often also outright outrageous. Marcel Duchamp changed the very definition of what can be considered art; the Guerrilla Girls incited political protests and exhibited blatant contempt for social rules; Dred Scott posed such a perceived threat to the sanctity of American patriotism that he inspired congressional action. Art is not meant to be polite, genteel or tame. It’s meant to be loud, unapologetic and dangerous. The artworks that have left the deepest impressions have always been the ones that startle me, amaze me, terrify me and leave me in a pensive purgatory for hours or days afterward. 
I would be remiss if I let “State of the Art” peter to an end without writing about the most staggering artists and exhibits I have ever encountered, and their long-standing impacts on me. So, in no particular order and in all their exorbitant glory, here they are.
The Rain Room is a permanent display at LACMA and one of its most popular exhibits. Photo from Yelp.
Random International, “Rain Room” at LACMA
I was brought to this exhibit by a guy on our first (and last) date during one of my first weeks in Los Angeles. While we never hung out again, I dreamt of the Rain Room for weeks afterward and am reminded of it each time it rains. There’s something inexplicably surreal and powerful about walking through a vast sheet of falling water droplets, only to emerge out the other side completely dry and untouched. The effect was achieved through 3-D tracking cameras that triggered a column of dry air when they sensed a body entering the field. A theatrical spotlight illuminating the otherwise-darkened room from the side gave the rain a glittering silver sheen, creating a dazzling display of Mother Nature at her most soothing. To me, the exhibit was a feat of modern engineering that rewrote the norms of nature and physical consciousness. I have always awed at the sheer beauty and magnitude of torrential downpours like the one replicated in the room — rain is one of the main things I miss about my home in Maryland — but being able to bend the elements with my very presence was an entirely unprecedented and unreal experience. Being there was like being in a dream. 
Takashi Murakami, “Learning the Magic of Painting” at Galerie Perrotin 
I stumbled upon this exhibit quite by accident while lost in the maze of Paris’ Marais district. Within the unsuspecting, ivy-ridden walls of the Galerie Perrotin, I found a sanctuary of abstraction and oddities. Murakami’s favorite motifs include encrusted skulls, platinum-leafed chrysanthemums, cartoon characters, Buddhist symbols and hypnotic visions of outer space. The experience was a walk deeper and deeper into the dark, ludicrous and most extraordinary mind of a mad genius. I imagine his vibrant prints, intricate diptychs and 100-meter long, full-room paintings to be physical expressions of an intense psychedelic trip. The centerpiece in the final room was a grotesque, hyperrealistic, mechanical sculpture of a Japanese monk with his arms aloft in a spiritual pose, face split open vertically into layered folds and four eyes rolling uncontrollably as he emitted a droning prayer. As shaken as I was by the sight, I was entranced by its simultaneous ugliness and exquisiteness. There has hardly been another artist with a style as distinct or demeanor as bold as Murakami’s and I will always remember seeing his magic in person. 
Xavier Le Roy, “Temporary Title” at Le Centre Pompidou
I visited this exhibit with a close friend on a whim, after dubiously answering yes to the question, “Do you want to see nude performance art?” Hardly knowing what to expect, we walked into a sparingly lit, carpeted room littered with nude men and women strewn across the floor. They crawled like jungle cats; they formed patterns and shapes with their bodies; they intermittently collapsed into sleeping heaps; they approached audience members sitting on the sidelines and, in their smoldering nakedness, engaged them in conversation about the nature of love. The entire experience was utterly bizarre, combining animalistic choreography with philosophical posturing, and left me with a lingering sense of something very familiar, yet strangely off-kilter. However, fresh from the aftermath of my first real breakup at the time, I was deeply touched by the wisdom offered by the nude woman who spoke to me: Love gets better as you age and he wasn’t the best I’d ever have. In the end, Le Roy created a remarkable performance that wasn’t so much about stark nudity as it was about the aesthetic of audience interaction and the importance of forging human connections. Those elements, and those lessons on love, have stayed with me to this day. 
It’s difficult to fathom how different my life would be without art, but I do know one thing: Art has never made me feel safer, but it has made me better. I wouldn’t have had an excuse to skip high school to Metro to the Smithsonian and wander, blissfully and aimlessly, through the National Portrait Gallery for hours. I wouldn’t have wallowed away a perfect, sun-kissed Saturday afternoon lounging in the grass outside the Museumplein in Amsterdam. I wouldn’t have fallen in love with Brussels or Chicago or Los Angeles as swiftly as I did. Above all, I wouldn’t have pushed myself out of my comfort zone to learn and explore and absorb the entire world with an insatiable appetite. 
Art — thank you for continually jarring me out of complacency, forcing me to mature and making me who I am.

During the final Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting of the academic year, the senate voted unanimously in favor of creating a permanent DREAM Center for undocumented students. 
At the final USG meeting of the 2018-19 school year, the Senate approved a resolution to create a permanent DREAM center. Yuwei Xi | Daily Trojan
The senate resolution states that approximately one in every 200 undergraduate students at the University is undocumented. The resolution comes the same day that a D.C. federal judge ordered that the government re-open applications for undocumented students benefiting from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
The Improving Dreams, Education and Academic Success organization at USC, which focuses on aiding and creating a safe space for undocumented students and allies, said they were grateful for the support the undocumented community has received.
“With the passing of this resolution we remain hopeful now more than ever that USC can lead the efforts to ensure that the needs of the undocumented students are met fully with the establishment of this DREAM Center,” IDEAS at USC said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “The fight continues. There is definitely more work that can be done, but this is a step in the right direction.”
For the permanent DREAM Center, the resolution calls for the hiring of one full-time staff member to address the needs of undocumented students at the University.
The staff member would be “directly involved in the continuing efforts of USG, [GSG], the administration and other organizations on campus to provide the proper support and assistance to undocumented and at-risk students,” the resolution states.
One of the main functions of the center will be to provide legal counseling to undocumented students regarding their immigration status. The resolution also requests the creation of an official resources page for undocumented students to access on the University’s Student Affairs website.
Currently, USC students and staff members can receive help from the Immigration Clinic at the Gould School of Law. The clinic provides help for USC community members who need legal advice and help filling out naturalization, citizenship and DACA renewal forms. 
“The investment will be aimed at ensuring that the undocumented or at-risk student population is provided any and all information needed regarding proper legal assistance or guidance concerning their immigration status or their family’s immigration status,” the resolution states.
Along with the senate resolution regarding the DREAM center, former Speaker Pro Tempore Tyler Matheson presented a framework to determine the compensation of officials within USG. 
Matheson noted the large discrepancies in the current pay system, particularly between the president and senators — the president currently makes approximately $15.63 per hour, while the senators receive $7.81.
“This is what I’m proposing as the new pay structure,” Matheson said. “Instead of an arbitrary stipend, it will be based upon seniority in the organization.”
The proposed pay structure suggests the categorization of USG officials’ wages into four tiers: senators, associate directors, programming directors and communications directors would receive $10.50 per hour; the executive board would receive $12 per hour; the vice president would receive $13; and the president would receive $14.
These modifications would result in a 10 percent reduction in compensation for the USG president. The vice president would receive 6 percent less, and senators would receive a wage increase of 34 percent.
If the 2018-19 USG Senate chooses to apply these changes, they will go into effect during the 2019-20 academic year. Members of the current senate will not determine their own levels of compensation, but rather the wages of the following USG administration.
The next USG Senate meeting will take place on Tuesday, Aug. 21 to kick off the next academic year.

Latinx students, faculty and alumni attended a town hall hosted by USC Latinx organizations to discuss a name change for El Centro Chicano, USC’s Latinx student resource center. 
Kyle Kawaguchi | Daily Trojan
The Central American Network, the Latinx Student Assembly, the Latino/a Graduate Student Association and El Centro Chicano have been discussing ways to create a more inclusive space under El Centro Chicano since February. CAN proposed a name change through a petition in February.
Some students agreed that the new name of the resource center should encompass the growing population of Central American, South American and Caribbean students at USC as well as international, LGBTQ and Afrolatinx groups. 
Some attendees suggested new names for the center such as El Centro de las Américas (The Center of the Americas), El Centro de la Gente (The Center of the People) and LA CASA, an acronym for Latinx Center for Advocacy and Student Affairs, which also translates to “the home” in Spanish.
“The name itself is so important,” said Valeria Ortiz, a Colombian American freshman who attended the event. “It signals to students, especially new incoming students, a place where they belong. If from the beginning, they hear a name they don’t identify with, it might have negative repercussions to those students who might need a space.”
Several students who spoke at the event said they felt discouraged from seeking resources at the center because its name did not encompass their identity. A few Central American students said some groups of Latinx descent feel like a minority within a minority, and that a name change would be a step toward changing that.
“Identity is so fluid, [and so are] our names. Our institutions should be just as fluid,” Ortiz said. “That fact that we’re being able to choose the name right now is really empowering for us as students.”
In a statement, CAN, LSA, LGSA and El Centro Chicano said, “[The organizations] are working diligently … to find the most inclusive name that will resonate with constituents and honor the center’s legacy as well.”
The question of a name change has come up before, according to Billy Vela, director of El Centro Chicano.
“It is clear that a name change is needed as stated by each organization part of this coalition at tonight’s Town Hall meeting,” he said. “We will continue to move forward in finalizing a name that builds off El Centro Chicano’s legacy and is more inclusive for current and future Trojans.”
CAN called for the center to drop “Chicano” from its name in February and garnered approximately 300 signatures in a petition.
The term “Chicano” has been associated exclusively with Mexican Americans and was utilized throughout the 1960s Chicano movement, which advocated for civil rights and empowerment of Mexican Americans.
Tomás Durán, an alumnus and administrator of special projects for the Price School of Public Policy, grew up with parents who were involved in the Chicano movement. He acknowledged the reasons for change, but said his understanding of the definition of Chicano encompassed more than just Mexican Americans.
“For me, Chicano is not so much a cultural identity as much as it is a political consciousness,” Durán said. “[Growing up Chicano] meant that you were progressive, that you were concerned about your community to help other people improve their lives to advance everybody as a whole.”
Some attendees said they  were open to keeping the message of empowerment behind the term “Chicano” intact.
“I want [the name] to maintain the spirit of the Chicano Movement, that spirit of wanting to change, wanting to sort of champion social and human rights,” Ortiz said. “I want it to keep that essence as well so [I want a name] that includes all students who identify as Latin American or as Latinx as well as maintain the activist spirit.”
Vela said it is important to maintain the roots of  the center.
“We value our history and the movement that fought for this incredible ethnic specific center,” he said. “Building on El Centro Chicano’s legacy, this provides our diverse community an opportunity for us to dig deep, think critically and figure out how to move the Trojan Familia forward in this new charged political climate era.”
After the organizations narrow down the list of names brainstormed at the town hall, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry will review the name and decide whether to approve it, Vela said.

After a series of protests in the past few weeks calling for better benefits and higher wages, USC subcontractor Aramark agreed on a new contract with USC custodians on Saturday to increase wages and to reduce health insurance expenses. 
USC service employees reached an agreement with subcontractor Aramark that will increase wages by $3 over the course of four years. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
According to Cesar Quiles-Borrero, the Service Employees International Union United Service Workers West Internal Organizer, the agreement was ratified by 98.5 percent of the union. 
Workers at USC will receive a $3 rate increase over the course of the four-year contract with Aramark. While the average custodian is currently being paid $12.50 per hour, they will earn $15.50 by 2021. The first wage increase will start this year on July 1. 
“Addressing the issues must matter to a company like Aramark because employees’ satisfaction translates to an effective work crew,” Quiles-Borrero said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It was due that the workers received a comprehensive package. By January 2021, current employees will be an estimated $1.10 above minimum, that is an impressive improvement. Under the new terms, many of then can continue been part of the Trojan Family for many years to come.”
In regard to health insurance, the out-of-pocket expenses for the plan will decrease to 6.75 percent on June 1 and eventually to 6 percent in 2021. 
Aramark has also implemented other regulations in the new contract, such as a stipend of $35 per year to purchase a pair of work shoes from the company’s collection. This amount will eventually be raised to $40 on Jan. 1, 2020.
“We respect and value our employees who work at USC, and are pleased to reach an agreement that works for everyone,” Karen Cutler, vice president of corporate communications at Aramark, said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
According to Quiles-Borrero, over 200 families will benefit from the new contract. 
“The custodians are happy and very grateful with the students, the bargaining committee and their Union,” Quiles-Borrero said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We do not believe that is all that they deserve, but it’s a decent compensation for all the hard work they do. We will return in 45 months stronger and hungrier than ever to protect and gain more benefits.”

When George Zimmerman was acquitted for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, in 2013, three women decided not only that they’d had enough, but that they needed to take action. Alicia Garza, Patrisse Khan-Cullors and Opal Tometi went on to found the Black Lives Matter movement, which now has 40 chapters led by members all around the world that work on combating violence inflicted on black communities.
Patrisse Khan-Cullors spoke on Tuesday evening at Bovard Auditorium. Wanting He | Daily Trojan
Khan-Cullors spoke about the movement at Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday evening for an event sponsored by the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, Sol Price School of Public Policy and the School of Architecture. José Richard Aviles, a graduate student pursuing a master’s degree in social work, moderated the event.
Aviles spoke with Khan-Cullors about her identity as a queer black woman, systemic racism, environmentalism and the future of Los Angeles, as well as her latest book When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir.
Khan-Cullors is currently a student at USC working on getting her Master of Fine Arts in the Roski School of Art and Design. She emphasized that there is a need to differentiate between the Black Power and Black Lives Matter movements.
“A big part of starting Black Lives Matter for Alicia, Opal and I was to challenge the norms of the Black Power Movement,” she said during the discussion. “I think a lot about the March on Washington [in 1963] where they did not allow women to speak, literally. Women were banned from speaking, where they didn’t allow [civil rights activist] Bayard Rustin to speak because he was gay. And so what does it mean to not just challenge that, but forge a new path for us and for queer folks and for queer black and brown folks?”
Khan-Cullors is also the founder of Dignity and Power Now, a Los Angeles-based organization working to end state violence and mass incarceration. She received the Sydney Peace Prize in 2017 for her work with Black Lives Matter and was named a Civil Rights Leader for the 21st Century by the Los Angeles Times in 2015.
“For white people, I think the goal of accountability is incredibly important, it’s not just in the apology, or the word, or the phrase; it’s in the practice,” Khan-Cullors said. “And for those people who have ever been harmed, or anybody that betrayed you or you feel dissed by someone, they can say sorry all they want, but how they act in the future feels and is more important.”
Mayal Peter, a School of Architecture alumnus who was in the audience, said that Khan-Cullors’ talk spurred an important discussion on how community-building can be improved.
“It was very much about being in public spaces and how we live together really comes into play with that, so I was interested to see how that would come up,” Peter said.
Khan-Cullors finished the discussion with an optimistic look toward the future.
“If we can save Los Angeles, I bet you, bet you, bet you that we can save the world,” Khan-Cullors said.

With a dominant victory over UCLA on Saturday, the Trojans clinched the No. 1 rank in the NCAA and the MPSF as well as a nearly-perfect 21-1 regular season record. Now, the team turns its focus to the postseason: two weeks of grueling rematches against some of its fiercest foes in the pool. Postseason play will begin with the MPSF Tournament in Berkeley this weekend.

With their newly claimed position in the conference, the Trojans will take a bye during the first round of play on Friday, resting as No. 3 seed Stanford faces No. 6 seed San Jose State and No. 4 seed UCLA takes on No. 5 seed Arizona State. The Cal Bears will also take a seat during the first round of play as the No. 2 seed.
In the second round, the Trojans will face off against the winner of the game between UCLA and Arizona State. The team already defeated both teams handily in the regular season, and it’s fresh off of its victory over UCLA last weekend. However, wins earlier in the season often come back to haunt MPSF teams when they battle in the conference tournament, and UCLA has often knocked the Trojans off of their top-seeded pedestal in postseason play.
If the Trojans advance to the finals, they will have a shot at avenging their only loss of the season — a 3-9 defeat against then-No. 1 Stanford early in the season. The team was already able to balance the scales with a win over the Cardinal two weeks ago, solidly handling the team 8-5 at home, but the chance to prove themselves in a third meeting would give the season advantage to the Trojans. To do that, however, Stanford would have to knock off No. 2 seed Cal, which USC has already met and defeated twice this season.
After the MPSF Tournament, the Trojans will return home to host the NCAA Championships at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center the following week. After winning the championship in 2016, the team didn’t make it to the finals last year and was instead forced to watch rivals, Stanford and UCLA, battle for the championship. This season, the team refuses to sit on the sidelines, and with the best record in the nation, they look to prove themselves with a title win.
Senior utility Hayley McKelvey earned a sizable confidence boost after the victory over UCLA last weekend, leading the offense with a career-high of 5 goals on Senior Day. The standout performance earned her first career distinction as MPSF Player of the Week, becoming the first player on the roster to be named as the conference’s weekly selection.
McKelvey is typically a defensive force for the Trojans, locking down the team’s smothering performance when guarding its goal. In continuation of that role, she snagged four steals to help the team hold the Bruins to 5 goals. She added an assist to her 5 goals, which moved her to No. 26 in all-time scoring in program history with 106 goals over her four-year career in cardinal and gold. The senior has now scored in the past seven games, as the Trojans notched a perfect record in MPSF play.
The Trojans will lean on senior leadership from McKelvey and senior keeper Amanda Longan as they enter postseason play. Throughout the regular season, the team held opponents to low-scoring performances, controlling the pulse of play for all four quarters. That style of play will be the team’s greatest asset as it enters two weeks of rigorous play against the top teams in the game, as it will most likely face the same teams for both the conference and national championships.
With the regular season coming to a close, the Trojans have achieved near perfection. All that stands between this team and two more trophies to add to their case is the next two weeks of postseason play.

On Tuesday, the USC Trojans lost 8-5 to the Long Beach State Dirtbags at Dedeaux Field, after giving up 4 runs in the ninth inning.

Entering the game, the Trojans were looking for improvement on the mound. In last weekend’s sweep from UCLA, the Trojans gave up 42 runs in the three games.
The pitchers had an opportunity to thrive against a 16-24 Long Beach State team that had hit .230 as a team. While pitching was solid for seven of the nine innings, timely hitting from Long Beach State and fielding mistakes by USC led to a 8-4 victory for the visiting team.
The bats on both sides came out slow, as they went scoreless and combined for one hit through the first three innings. Long Beach State came close in the top of the second, when a single, a walk and an error had the bases loaded with two outs. USC freshman pitcher John Beller ended the inning by striking out shortstop Santino Riviera with a swinging strike.
The Dirtbags opened the scoring in the fourth inning after a throwing error by freshman shortstop Ben Ramirez. Long Beach State right fielder Joey Sanchez followed up with an RBI single in the next at-bat, giving the Dirtbags a 2-0 lead.
The Trojans responded in the bottom of the frame. Junior center fielder Lars Nootbaar hit a single for the team’s first hit of the game, advancing freshman right fielder Jamal O’Guinn to third after he was walked. Redshirt junior designated hitter Stephen Dubb singled with the bases loaded to score both O’Guinn and Nootbaar, tying the game 2-2.
Junior first baseman Dillon Paulson scored on a sacrifice fly to left field by junior second baseman Chase Bushor. 
The Trojans tacked on another run in the fifth when redshirt sophomore catcher Kaleb Murphy scored on a Paulson groundout, bringing the score to 4-2 for USC. The team had a nice cushion, but Dubb struck out looking with runners on second and third.
USC failed to put the Dirtbags away, though. When Beller fielded a bunt attempt with runners on first and second, his throw to third brought in a runner to cut the Trojans’ lead to one. 
Beller was then replaced by sophomore Chris Clarke after allowing eight hits and striking out four in a little over seven innings.
Long Beach State tied the game with an RBI groundout from pinch hitter Tristan Mercadel. The Dirtbags would take the lead in the top of the ninth when Jones stung a double down the left field line. Jones’ pinch runner Garrett Nelson would score from third on an infield single by left fielder Brooks Stotler, bringing the score to 6-4 in favor of Long Beach State. 
The Dirtbags did what USC couldn’t do earlier in the contest: use their momentum to put their opponent away. 
Mercadel added two more RBIs with a single into center. Clarke allowed 4 runs in 1.2 innings, and was replaced by sophomore closer Connor Lunn.
Down 8-4 in the bottom of the ninth, doubles from Ramirez and sophomore pinch hitter Matthew Acosta cut the deficit to 3 with two outs. USC’s best hitter, Nootbaar, was up with a runner on second, so the Trojans had life. After falling behind 0-2, Nootbaar worked back to a 2-2 count, only to strike out looking at a fastball right down the middle.
Nootbaar’s final at-bat was representative of the game for USC; a slow start, hopeful middle, but ultimately nothing but disappointment. The Trojans had control of this game in the middle innings, but Clarke’s poor performance sunk their chances. 
For a team that ranked second in the nation in fielding percentage before the game, four errors (three of which led to 4 runs) is unacceptable. If the defense had played up to its typical high standards, Clarke could have entered the game with a 4-run lead and less pressure.
There is no doubt that this was a frustrating loss, especially coming on the heels of last weekend’s disappointing effort against the Bruins. Long Beach State is a below average team in an inferior division. Head coach Dan Hubbs will have to take action to light a fire under his team as the Trojans hit the road for this weekend’s road series against Oregon.

On Thursday, the 2018 NFL Draft begins, featuring one of the most intriguing quarterback classes since 2004 — the year Eli Manning, Philip Rivers and Ben Roethlisberger all landed in the first round.
As many as four quarterbacks could be drafted in the first five picks and it seems like fans and NFL teams alike have no idea what exactly is going to happen. 
Here is my mock draft for the first 10 picks, plus some bonus predictions for draft-eligible USC players. Each pick is not necessarily what I think will happen in the draft, but rather what I think each team should do, based on how I rate the top prospects. 
No. 1 Cleveland Browns: Sam Darnold, QB USC 
It has to be Darnold. He’s the toughest and most unflappable quarterback in this draft class, which will come in handy in Cleveland, a notoriously difficult place for young quarterbacks to play. Darnold still has a lot of work to do — his footwork is sloppy and his ball security was non-existent in 2017 (he had a whopping 21 turnovers). But he’s a much more refined and decorated passer than Wyoming’s Josh Allen, whom the Browns seem to also be considering. 
No. 2 New York Giants: Josh Rosen, QB UCLA 
The Giants have one of the toughest decisions in the draft: Should they draft the best talent available (read: Saquon Barkley) or a quarterback to replace the aging Eli Manning? If I were the Giants, I’d draft a quarterback who can lead the franchise into a new era and then use picks on offensive linemen and skill players in later rounds, where there’s still value. Rosen often looks shaken under pressure, but he possesses all the physical tools to be successful.
No. 3 New York Jets: Baker Mayfield, QB Oklahoma 
The Jets traded up from No. 6 to No. 3, presumably to acquire an elite quarterback. They have two serviceable options under contract for next year — Teddy Bridgewater and Josh McCown — so there’s not a ton of pressure to draft a guy who can start  from day one. Therefore, with Rosen off the board, the Jets take Mayfield, an undersized yet cerebral signal caller who won the Heisman Trophy in 2017. 
No. 4 Cleveland Browns: Saquon Barkley, RB Penn State
One could make an argument for defensive end Bradley Chubb at this spot, but the Browns already have a talented defensive front with the likes of Myles Garrett and Emmanuel Ogbah. Here, they should fill a more pressing need and pick the most explosive offensive player in the draft. Barkley should make an immediate impact in both the running and passing games, serving as a game-changing playmaker for Darnold.
No. 5 Denver Broncos: Bradley Chubb, DE NC State
Denver signed former Vikings quarterback Case Keenum to a two-year $36 million deal in March, so general manager John Elway doesn’t need to reach for Allen at this point in the draft. If the Broncos don’t trade the pick, they should take Chubb, a prototypical pass-rusher who would wreak havoc opposite six-time Pro-Bowler Von Miller. 
No. 6 Indianapolis Colts: Quenton Nelson, OG Notre Dame 
The Colts need to do a better job protecting their oft-injured franchise quarterback Andrew Luck. They start by picking Nelson, by far the best offensive lineman in this draft class. He’s an elite run blocker and pass protector with a nasty streak that sets him apart from the pack. 
No. 7 Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Minkah Fitzpatrick, S Alabama
Florida State safety Derwin James also makes sense here, but Fitzpatrick is the more pro-ready prospect. He’s versatile enough to play all over the secondary and he possesses the athletic ability to cover both wide receivers and tight ends. Perhaps more importantly, his work ethic and leadership are unmatched, making him one of Alabama head coach Nick Saban’s favorite players during his time with the Crimson Tide. 
No. 8 Chicago Bears: Mike McGlinchey, OT Notre Dame
This is a bit of reach, but the Bears desperately need to protect their young quarterback Mitch Trubisky before addressing other needs. McGlinchey is a natural pass blocker, who can start for Chicago from week one. 
No. 9 San Francisco 49ers: Roquan Smith, LB Georgia 
One of my favorite players in this year’s draft, Smith makes up for his undersized frame (6’1”, 236 pounds) with clinical tackling and excellent coverage skills. With second-year middle linebacker Reuben Foster’s career up in the air due to a domestic violence arrest, Smith will help fill the void at the position, even if he winds up playing on the outside. 
No. 10 Oakland Raiders: Derwin James, S Florida State
The Raiders could also use a linebacker of Smith’s quality, but if their Bay Area rivals pull the trigger first, they’ll settle for James — a hard-hitting, big-bodied safety, who plays similarly to the Seahawks’ Kam Chancellor. 
USC Prospects 
RB Ronald Jones II
Jones is a shifty runner who combines speed, quickness and power. He’ll be a day-two steal in round two or three for a team like the Broncos or Lions, who are in need of running backs.

OLB Uchenna Nwosu
Nwosu may not have the athletic ability to become an elite pass rusher, but he’s an intelligent football player with great instincts. He could compete for playing time right away for linebacker-needy teams like the 49ers or Bills. Expect him to get drafted in the third or fourth round. 
WR Deontay Burnett 
Burnett lacks explosive speed and a prototypical frame, but he’s a skilled route runner with solid hands. That should be enough for him to get picked up in the seventh round as a team’s backup slot receiver. I could see him going to the 49ers or Eagles, where respective star quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo and Carson Wentz could use more offensive weapons.
Trevor Denton is a sophomore majoring in journalism. He is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “T-Time,” ran Wednesdays.
