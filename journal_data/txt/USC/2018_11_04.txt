Ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm elections, the Daily Trojan’s Editorial Board has compiled a list of the state measures and select candidates for state offices Californians will be voting on. Here are our recommendations for how voters should cast their ballots on Tuesday. 
Dianne Feinstein (Senator)
While State Sen. Kevin de León offers a promising progressive platform, incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s experience and resume make her deserving of another term. The California Democratic Party’s endorsement of de León indicates the party’s progressive pathway, but the more moderate Feinstein has shown an ability to compromise that de León might not possess. She has generally voted against the Trump administration’s policies — and if she narrowly wins, Feinstein may be coerced to move more to the left.
Gavin Newsom (Governor)
California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom has been groomed for the governorship, having long been embedded in California politics as the mayor of San Francisco prior to his current position. Newsom was ahead of even most progressives in 2004 when he ordered the San Francisco city clerk to start issuing same-sex marriage licenses, and he has a grasp on state politics and issues that his opponent, Republican businessman John Cox, does not. Cox is inexperienced and his platform is vague, making Newsom the clear choice for governor.
Ed Hernandez (Lieutenant Governor)
State Sen. Hernandez has an edge over fellow Democrat Eleni Kounalakis due to his extensive work in state politics and expertise in health care. He is a legislator of experience and substance, having fought against special interests in the pharmaceutical industry, and will bring a strong moral compass to the position.
Alex Padilla (Secretary of State)
Democratic incumbent Alex Padilla deserves a second term as California’s secretary of state because he has delivered on most of his first-term campaign promises, including improving voting technology and voter accessibility. What’s more, his challenger Republican Mark Meuser has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims that California and the nation have been corrupted by voter fraud.
Xavier Becerra (Attorney General)
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has made a name for himself as attorney general for taking on the Trump administration, suing it 44 times on policies including immigration, the environment and health care. Becerra has shown a willingness to fight for Californian’s interests, and he deserves a full term to continue in the position.
Tony Thurmond (Superintendent of Public Instruction)
While both California Assemblyman Tony Thurmond and fellow Democrat Marshall Tuck prioritize fulfilling the need for increasing school funding and addressing the teacher shortage, Thurmond’s platform gets the vote because of its emphasis on students’ overall well-being. Thurmond sees a correlation between attendance and the criminal justice system, and hopes to keep students out of jail by integrating more after-school programs.
 
KEY BALLOT MEASURES
Proposition 1: YES
Specified Housing Assistance
This measure authorizes $4 billion for existing affordable housing programs for veterans, working families, low-income residents, seniors and disabled people. Prop 1 is a worthy investment in alleviating California’s housing crisis, one of the worst in the nation.
Proposition 2: YES
Housing for the Mentally Ill
California is currently prohibited from spending money on supportive housing for mentally ill homeless people. This measure is a valiant effort to clear that obstacle by using $140 million per year of county mental health funds to pay for housing.
Proposition 3: NO
Water Supply Projects
While this measure provides funds in state general obligation bonds for various infrastructure projects, it serves only a few specific interests or regions. However, aside from granting money to organizations, this measure will not produce one drop of reusable water.
Proposition 4: YES
Children’s Hospital Construction
Prop 4 increases capacity, provides new technology and advances research to serve the over 2 million sick children in California’s Children’s Hospitals each year. This measure makes it possible for hospitals to upgrade their buildings to accommodate a growing need.
Proposition 5: NO
Property Tax Breaks
Aside from gifting wealthy homeowners with the ability to keep their lower property taxes, this measure transfers property tax burdens to cities, counties and school districts. To add to this, the proposition fails to build new housing or help people purchase homes for the first time.
Proposition 6: NO
Gas Tax & Infrastructure
Prop 6 is opposed by organizations comprising first responders because it jeopardizes the safety of bridges and roads and eliminates $5 billion in local transportation funding, and would only hinder repairs and construction of infrastructure.
Proposition 7: NO
Daylight Savings Time
Subject to federal approval, voting no would allow California to maintain its current daylight saving time period (early March to early November) instead of giving the legislature the power to end the biannual time changes.
Proposition 8: NO
Kidney Dialysis Clinics
This measure caps dialysis center revenues without effectively enhancing patient care and would drive much-needed clinics out of business. Voting no is the right choice because it would not require dialysis clinics to pay rebates or limit their revenues.
Proposition 10: YES
Rent Control
Yes on Prop 10 would give cities the ability to enact or expand rent control laws and protects local communities by putting annual caps on the amount landlords can raise rent. If passed, this measure will keep tenants in their homes and reduce homelessness rates.
Proposition 11: YES
Emergency Ambulance Employees
This measure would make it clear that paramedics and emergency medical technicians employed by private companies must remain reachable during paid breaks, following the status quo of other emergency responders. It would maintain current emergency response times and keep Californians safe while also improving mental health services for medical responders.
Proposition 12: YES
Farm Animal Confinement
Prop 12 takes a strong stance against farm animal cruelty by requiring larger quarters for egg-laying chickens and other animals raised for human consumption. Though farmers will most likely have to spend more money to update their facilities, the cost to consumers will be minimal and the improvements in animal welfare will be rewarding.

It’s been a rough couple of months for people concerned about the environment. Natural disasters have been hitting states with unceasing ferocity, wildfires tore through the West Coast and, of course, at the beginning of October, humanity was given a dire reality check on its impact via the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. Hopefully, 2018 has shown just how much climate change is already affecting our world and the drastic changes that need to be made to effectively combat it. 
We as a species have already witnessed some of the effects of climate change, habitat destruction and pollution. It’s bleak, and it certainly doesn’t help that the United States is currently under a political administration that delights in repealing the few laws that were reversing the damage. But tomorrow is Election Day, and as citizens of a democratic republic, we have the power to turn the tide, at least a little bit. One particularly exciting thing about this midterm election — not quite as exciting as Texas senatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke on a skateboard, but nothing can really top that — is the wide range of environment and conservation-based legislation that is up for voting in various states. 
I will always believe that voting is the most powerful thing a citizen can do to effect necessary policy changes; luckily for America, there are a lot of measures that, if passed, would have major implications on the future of our nation’s environmental policy. If you are a citizen of any of these states and haven’t voted yet, I highly encourage you to think about the environment when you fill out your ballot. 
The most radical — and possibly most revolutionary — piece of legislation up for voting this year comes from my home state of Washington. Washington Initiative 1631 seeks to levy a $15 tax per metric ton of carbon emission on big polluters beginning 2020, and to increase that tax by $2 per ton every year until the state reaches its emission goals. The policy takes a refreshingly hard line against the biggest carbon offenders, and would make Washington the first state government ever to introduce a carbon tax through public referendum. If Washington voters say yes to 1631, it could set a trend of aggressive carbon taxing throughout the United States.  
In Nevada, the Renewable Energy Standards Initiative requires electric companies to acquire at least 50 percent of their energy from renewable resources by 2030. The initiative was set up by an interest group called NextGen Climate Action, which pushes for renewable energy policy in southwestern states. Nevada is one of the most sun-drenched states in the country. NextGen founder Tom Steyer referred to it as “the Saudi Arabia of renewable resources,” and is using this initiative to push for heavier reliance on solar energy in the state. Voting yes on the measure will set a precedent for states to embrace renewable energy. 
NextGen also pushed for a similar policy in Arizona. Arizona’s Prop 127 would also require 50 percent of energy to come from renewable sources by 2030, but slowly works up to that target, beginning with a 12 percent requirement in 2020 and incremental increase annually. Voting yes on Arizona’s Renewable Energy Standards Initiative (yes, they have the same name) will not only increase the attention on renewable energy, but also provide an interesting experiment in environmental policy design when compared to Nevada’s almost-identical policy. 
Georgia’s Amendment 1, the (not-very-aptly titled) Portion of Revenue from Outdoor Recreation Equipment Sales Tax Dedicated to Land Conservation Fund Amendment, introduces a truly novel concept to funding conservation efforts: using sales tax from recreation gear to fund stewardship and habitat rehabbing projects. Essentially, every time someone buys outdoor sporting goods like tents or boots, 80 percent of sales tax would be diverted to the Georgia Outdoor Stewardship Trust Fund. So when people are purchasing outdoor gear and paraphernalia, they are also donating to conserve the habitats they’re venturing into. It’s such a simple and ingenious idea, and if enough Georgians vote yes, I hope it catches on. 
Of course, I would be remiss to not mention California’s Prop 6 and Prop 12, which address a repeal of the gas tax and improving farm animal conditions, respectively. Environmentally conscious Californians should vote no on 6 and yes on 12, as discussed in two Daily Trojan editorials published last week as well as in our endorsements. 
There are a few other races to watch: Florida is voting on the legality of wagering on dog races; Rhode Island has a huge bond up for election to protect and restore its coasts; North Carolina has a repulsive act that would declare hunting and fishing to be a constitutional right; and Alaska is voting on the regulation of industrial projects in salmon habitats. Americans could very well wake up on Nov. 7 to a country that is far more invested in conservation than it was just days before, but they absolutely must vote in their respective state to see this change. These acts feel like tiny rays of hope in a swirling cloud of bad news, and I encourage you to watch out for the results as the returns come in Tuesday evening.

USC College Republican members volunteer to phone bank for Republican candidates before the California midterm elections. (Photo courtesy of Sahil Nandwani)
The College Republicans at USC partnered with College Republicans of other universities within Los Angeles County to campaign for conservative California candidates this weekend. 
On Saturday, the student organization campaigned for Rita Topalian, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate, and on Sunday for State Sen. Janet Nguyen’s re-election campaign. 
USC College Republicans members also helped campaign for Young Kim, who is running to represent California’s 39th District and Steve Knight and Dante Acosta, who are running for re-election as U.S. representative and state assembly member, respectively. Some students also attended a rally in Santa Clarita for Knight, Acosta and gubernatorial candidate John Cox.
As part of its volunteer deployment efforts, the College Republicans made lawn signs, participated in phone banking and went door-to-door to talk with community members about the candidates they supported, encouraging them to vote. 
Austin Macleod, the vice president of College Republicans at USC and a senior majoring in international relations, said volunteer events encourage students to show support for local politicians and help Republicans gain popularity in California. 
“Even as a Republican in California, people like to think ‘Oh you’re never going to get a majority’ and that’s true, but we can prevent a super majority,” Macleod said. “There’s a lot of things we believe we can still do, and we think it’s just really important to get involved as much as we can.”
Last month, the College Republicans at USC participated in another volunteer deployment with other universities to support Frank Scotto, who is running for South Bay Assembly. Around 25 to 30 students met Scotto and learned about his position and views on current issues, according to Sahil Nandwani, the treasurer of College Republicans at USC. 
Macleod said that working with local conservative campaigns was crucial for an election year. Through these events, the organization hopes to create a sense of community and space for conservative students.
“How are you going to talk about politics and …  be a part of College Republicans if you’re not actually trying to help out your fellow Republicans who are running for office?” he said. 
Nandwani, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said that after campaigning for Scotto, members from the other L.A. colleges and universities went to the beach, and that the volunteer deployment events helped Republican students at different schools bond and form friendships.
“It’s really nice when you have everybody there together and then you can go do some sort of a social event afterwards, and you can actually connect all of these people who share some of the same views,” Nandwani said. 
He added that these events were helpful in encouraging political activism for young people in general. 
Rex Alley, secretary of College Republicans at USC and a senior majoring in political science, said the volunteer deployments also help members of the organization get to know one another and encourage civic engagement by educating members on local politics.
“It creates this mentality where you’re a part of a team,” Alley said. “You’re not just sitting at home or standing in line and checking off a box next to somebody’s name. You’re actually learning about them, going out and trying to convince other people to vote for a particular candidate, and I think that really fosters a sense of political self-efficacy.” 
Nandwani said he hopes the volunteer deployments give members the opportunity to learn about local Republican politicians and become more involved in the political process. 
He said he believes college students need to be more informed and civically engaged, so they can vote for and support the candidates that they believe will uphold their beliefs and values.
“At the end of the day, the only people that can really do something in terms of laws, in terms of policy, are your elected officials,” Nandwani said. “There is no reason that you should not have a stake in electing those officials. You can’t complain about the poor job that any one politician is doing if you don’t actively work in that district to either elect or reject that person or influence them in some way.”

Members of Trojan Advocates for Political Progress pose for a photo after canvassing for CA-25 Democratic candidate Katie Hill in October. (Photo from Facebook)
Trojan Advocates for Political Progress headed to Las Vegas from Nov. 2 to Nov. 4 to campaign for Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, who is running against incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller. In the state of Nevada, TAPP President Alec Vandenberg said the goal was to engage people who usually do not vote in the midterm elections.
Since Heller is a USC alumnus, Vandenberg said students may automatically vote for him. However, Vandenberg said that TAPP is campaigning for Rosen because they believe Heller doesnât properly represent the USC community. 
Vandenberg said Heller promised to protect the Affordable Care Act and vote against the American Health Care Act, but ultimately violated that promise. He instead supported the Graham-Cassidy Bill, which would reduce Medicaid funding.
âAs USC students with our own personal political beliefs and our own ideologies, we donât think heâs indicative of what we stand for at USC in that capacity,â Vandenberg said.
Vandenberg had been analyzing where TAPP could make the biggest impact, and between Nevadaâs close proximity and the urge to push out Heller, the group decided to go to Las Vegas.
âThe last thing we want is [to wake] up on Nov. 6, thinking that we didnât do enough or that we couldâve done more,â Vandenberg said. âThis weekend is part of a last minute effort to really make sure we have no regrets on Election Day.â
To get to Nevada, Esequiel Sandoval, a senior majoring in policy, planning and development, served as the point of contact for the Rosen campaign through a previous job. Even though he is not a member of TAPP, Sandoval said heâs been impressed with how TAPP has been able to mobilize  for events like this.
On Saturday, the group knocked on nearly 400 doors in an effort to garner support for Rosen, spending several hours in the afternoon going around neighborhoods. The next day, they began their second shift at 9 a.m., reaching about 200 more voters and also sending out texts, according to Vandenberg.
Nayanika Kapoor, TAPPâs Vice President of Internal Relations, said the political environment in Las Vegas was vastly different from that of Southern Californiaâs. 
âItâs way more moderate and the candidates are more moderate as well,â Kapoor said. â[Las Vegas] is a very different demographic, and we were acutally canvassing for Democratic voters. [A lot of it was] convincing voters to show up at the polls.â
Sandoval believes that Nevada is a key state to help turn the Senate from red to blue. Two seats are needed for the Democratic Party to take the majority, but 35 seats are up for reelection in 2018, meaning that the 26 seats held by Democrats will have to be retained in addition to turning two of the nine Republican seats. 
Nevada could prove to be a tight race, with Hellerâs approval rating at 37 percent and his disapproval rating at 44 percent.
Kapoor said that TAPP was looking to make a national impact in their canvassing efforts, and Rosenâs campaign was an opportunity for the group to become involved in a Senate race.
Both Vandenberg and Sandoval stressed the need to get involved, especially with this yearâs elections. Sandoval said that even though young voters may feel like their voices are unheard, they should not wait for the ideal candidate.
âConvincing people thereâs value in coming off the sidelines in a midterm election is so, so important,â Sandoval said. âThese are the most important midterm elections at least in the last 50 years.â

Yasmin Davis | Daily Trojan
When Mac Miller passed away in September, I — like many, many other people my age — felt like I had lost an old friend. The kid from Pittsburgh was so much more than a sound or a face in your music library. He was an icon — a symbol of authenticity, optimism and everlasting youth.
As a grimy-looking, hip-hop-loving white boy growing up in American suburbia, I fell in love with Mac at first listen. I was in eighth grade, driving back from Thanksgiving at the beach with my older brother. He popped in a CD with a crudely drawn blue streak on the cover, and what I heard made me feel different than anything I had ever heard before. 
The artist was talking about my life, my shenanigans, my aesthetic — hell, he made the music feel like my own. My addictive obsession couldn’t get its fix from just one listen, so as soon as I got home, I timidly asked my brother for a copy of “Blue Slide Park” for Christmas. That ride kicked off a long, supportive and loving relationship between Mac’s music and me. The rest is history.
So when I saw The Greek Theatre announce a Halloween memorial show (what would have been Mac’s L.A. stop of the “Swimming Tour”) filled with Mac’s friends, influences and collaborators from over the years, I knew I couldn’t miss it. Of course, so did every single body on the West Coast. So when I went to bed on Oct. 4, I made sure to set several alarms in preparation for the 10 a.m. ticket release. 
But, in typical Mac fashion, I took a “Senior Skip Day” that morning and decided to sleep in. When I finally woke up shortly after 11 a.m., I timidly pulled up Ticketmaster and was unsurprised to see that it had sold out. My heart only sank lower and lower as I perused resale markets only to find pit tickets selling for thousands.
Eventually, I reached a respectable point of self-forgiveness for failing to acquire tickets, and I finally accepted that I would not be joining my fellow Mac disciples for his final send-off. I closed my computer, congratulated friends who secured tickets and retreated to my room. My eyes instinctually gravitated towards my top shelf, where an old electronics bag had been collecting dust for only God knows how long. I looked inside, and the screen from my old iPod Classic stared back at me.
Suddenly, bits and pieces of high school memories began to flood my mind. I remembered my 15th birthday, when I sat in my New England boarding school dorm room sad and alone — listening to “K.I.D.S.” and “Macadelic” for company. I remembered when my dad picked me up at the end of sophomore year, and I asked him to play “Best Day Ever” as we drove through the school’s gates one last time.
I remembered crisp, frigid December mornings at Columbus High School, when my group of friends would huddle together in one of our cars and blast Mac’s many feel-good tracks before school. I remembered nervously showing my favorite songs to love interests, and naively gauging our compatibility from their reactions.
I laid in bed and put his discography on shuffle, and I tried to imagine my youth without his music as its backdrop. I couldn’t, and as I type this up, I still can’t. So, naturally, when The Mac Miller Circles Fund announced that it was going to live stream the entire concert online, I cleared my Halloween plans and set up camp in my living room with an HDMI cord, two joints and a tall glass of Jameson.
As I watched the night’s performers take the stage one by one, each more wildly different and talented than the last, I began to realize the true scope of Mac’s legacy. A-list artists, experimental collaborators and REMember Music signees (Mac’s personal music label) all performed side-by-side, with no prioritization for one artist over another. With each new artist, new memories of Mac would resurge — especially with Vince Staples and Chance The Rapper. 
Chance, now one of the biggest names in popular music, went on his first national tour as an opener for Mac on the Space Migration Tour in the summer of 2013, along with Vince and Odd Future’s “The Internet.” Only a few months prior, Chance released his ground-breaking mixtape “Acid Rap,” to which I had already developed an addiction. As well, I had been a fan of Vince’s “Shyne Coldchain” mixtape and Odd Future collaborations, so I bought two tickets for my mom and I (I wasn’t allowed to go to concerts alone at the time) to go see them at a crappy strip mall nightclub in Jacksonville, Fl.
Both Chance and Vince, armed only with laptops and microphones, delivered unforgettable performances to an unknown audience before Mac served as the main dish. Only a few years later, the two artists were selling out arenas, this time the suburbanites chanting their lyrics back at them. And with this concert, the three artists came full circle, with Chance and Vince giving heartwarming tributes to a friend who helped kick-start their careers.
I could write about this for days and days, and perhaps I will one day. But unfortunately, all good things must come to an end at some point, and, like Mac, I hope to leave you with enough material to remember him as he should — with laughs, smiles and an endless trail of nostalgia. Rest In Peace, Malcolm James McCormick (Jan. 19, 1992 – Sept. 8, 2018).

Rami Malek stars as Freddie Mercury in 2018 biopic ŌĆ£Bohemian Rhapsody.ŌĆØ Directed by Bryan Singer, the film explores MercuryŌĆÖs personal struggles as well as the rise of British rock band Queen. (Photo from IMDb)
Colorful costumes. Eccentric music. Bombastic visuals. These three elements best describe the onstage persona of rockstar and queer icon Freddie Mercury. The new biopic ŌĆ£Bohemian RhapsodyŌĆØ captures the essence of rock band Queen and its prominent members, focusing on frontman Freddie MercuryŌĆÖs life prior to the bandŌĆÖs iconic 1985 live televised performance at Wembley Stadium, which boasted a global audience of over two billion. 
ŌĆ£Bohemian RhapsodyŌĆØ is the story of Queen ŌĆö but more importantly, the story of MercuryŌĆÖs personal life and his struggles with relationships, sexuality and loneliness. His internal hardships are revealed throughout his revolutionary career as the lead singer of Queen. Eventually, the two storylines of MercuryŌĆÖs professional and personal lives converge, and his downfall snowballs into that of the band. 
The biggest success of ŌĆ£Bohemian RhapsodyŌĆØ is the complexity of MercuryŌĆÖs character, played by the formidable Rami Malek, who won an Emmy Award for his performance on the television show ŌĆ£Mr. Robot.ŌĆØ The acclaimed actor shows his acting prowess by impeccably emulating MercuryŌĆÖs British accent and capturing his flamboyant body language and mannerisms both on and offstage.
MalekŌĆÖs performance lends MercuryŌĆÖs character a sense of  tragedy and humanity, which grounded the entire film. Like Malek, the rest of the cast shines in their respective roles, Gwilym Lee as Queen guitarist Brian May and Lucy Boynton as MercuryŌĆÖs best friend Mary Austin effectively complement MalekŌĆÖs powerhouse performance. 
While the engaging soundtrack and captivating performances created an enjoyable cinematic experience, the script felt disjointed at times. The film spends nearly half an hour without contextualizing the audience in the reality of the story, instead offering a glorified montage of QueenŌĆÖs rise to stardom. After the credits roll, much of the film feels like a mixture of montages and long, expositional dialogues from Mercury about what Queen represents. This glorifying tone makes ŌĆ£Bohemian RhapsodyŌĆØ feel emotionally hollow at certain points. 
While some elements of MercuryŌĆÖs life appear glossed over, others are wonderfully and wholly represented. For instance, his relationship with Austin, his best friend and lover, is one of the highlights of the biopic. Director Bryan Singer captures their relationship with raw honesty that reverberates throughout the rest of the film. Despite its shortcomings with regard to storytelling, ŌĆ£Bohemian RhapsodyŌĆØ is a charming attempt at a glamorized biography of the band, decorated with endearing acting and an impeccably nostalgic soundtrack.

Cleveland-based indie-rock band Cloud Nothings performed at the Teragram Ballroom Friday. Led by frontman Dylan Baldi, the band primarily played tracks from its latest album “Last Building Burning.” (Madeline Aguirre | Daily Trojan)
Indie rock band Cloud Nothings wooed an intimate crowd of about 100 at the Teragram Ballroom during the L.A. stop of their “Last Building Burning” tour Friday night.
Despite the main act’s prowess, the two opening acts, Divinity Band and Shells, appeared disengaged with the audience. While their music was enjoyable, the performers’ lack of enthusiasm left the audience standing still.
Although the crowd was quite small as the show began, it grew immensely just before Cloud Nothings took the stage. Hailing from Cleveland, Ohio, Cloud Nothings is known for their genre-bending tendencies, experimenting with heavy rock, indie and pop from album to album. Their latest LP “Last Building Burning” features a stronger grasp of rock and roll influences with unrestrained guitar and drum solos.
The four-piece band opened their set with “On An Edge,” which immediately had the crowd bobbing along to the song’s hearty bass. Lead vocalist Dylan Baldi was energetic, bouncing in place and singing passionately. However, the remaining band members weakened the group’s stage presence as they remained stationary during their set, creating a disengaging environment onstage.
As Cloud Nothings transitioned into their second song and fan favorite “Leave Him Now,” the audience’s energy began to climb. As Baldi arrived at the catchy and powerful chorus, the crowd belted, “You’ve got to leave, leave, leave, leave him now,” while also forming a mosh pit.
When the band played the next two songs, “In Shame” and “Offer an End,” it became apparent that they were going to play their new album in its entirety. “In Shame” featured edgy, staccato notes. The audience’s energy waned with “Offer an End,” which transformed the mosh pit into a group of gentle swayers. Throughout the first couple of songs, Baldi’s voice was barely audible, with the instrumentals overpowering his vocals. The issue was never resolved, affecting Cloud Nothings’ performance for the rest of the night.
The next song “The Echo of the World” once again augmented the room’s energy levels, with Baldi immersing himself in the music and becoming visibly more comfortable with the crowd.
Both “So Right So Clean” and “Another Way of Life” were infused with energy, bringing back the mosh pit in full force. As “Another Way of Life” closed out the album, the crowd erupted into applause.
Cloud Nothings then transitioned into “Realize My Fate” and “Strange Year,” two tracks  from their fourth album “Life Without Sound.” With a gradual buildup, the band displayed a cool confidence while venturing into the familiar territory of its last album. “Strange Year” reached a peak response among audience members, with the mosh pit growing as the song continued.
Cloud Nothings journeyed back further into their discography with tracks “Pattern Walks” and “Stay Useless.” While both featured high intensity instrumentals, the crowd became increasingly fatigued.
The band concluded the night with “I’m Not Part of Me,” an upbeat number. The crowd rose to the occasion of the last song, singing the lyrics back to the band, reviving the mosh pit and cheering in support.
While each song showcased powerful instrumentals and overwhelming potential for hardcore headbanging, both Cloud Nothings and the audience ultimately failed to consistently carry the immense amount of energy the music demanded.

Redshirt junior driver Daniel Leong winds up to advance the ball down the pool. (Jo Danielle Esteban | Daily Trojan)
The men’s water polo team kicked off the weekend with a decisive 13-7 victory at home against No. 4 Cal Saturday before defeating No. 12 UC Irvine 15-5 on the road Sunday.
Saturday’s conference clash with Cal was particularly important for the Trojans, who are 0-1 this season in MPSF matches. The match began with a series of unanswered scores for the Trojans, propelling them to an early 3-0 lead. Sophomore driver Sawyer Rhodes led the attack with 2 goals, and freshman goalie Nic Porter came up with some important saves to secure a 4-1 Trojan advantage after one frame.
Freshman driver Hannes Daube, who leads the Trojans in goals per game, delivered 2 blasts to extend the Trojans’ lead to 7-1 approaching halftime. The Bears responded with 2 goals of their own in the last two minutes of the half, putting themselves within 4 of the Trojans.
Both teams were quiet for the first few minutes of the second half. After a pair of USC goals, Cal responded with another rally, scoring 3 consecutive goals to bring it within 3 at the end of the third. This late pressure forced the Trojans to maintain their focus and aim to finish the game out strong.
“We just sat down, talked about it, talked about being calm and collected,” junior 2-meter Matt Maier said. “Just go out and play what we can do, play how we can, and that’s what we did and it just worked out for us.”
The Trojans responded to the threat from Cal early in the fourth, as sophomore driver Marko Vavic netted 2 goals to extend the Trojan advantage to 11-6. After a missed shot from Cal, sophomore driver Jacob Mercep rifled in his second goal of the match. Cal was held to 1 goal in the final frame, and Mercep notched a hat trick to reach a team-leading 53 goals.
Porter was the linchpin of the Trojans’ defensive effort throughout Saturday’s game. Along with leading his team vocally by pointing out offensive threats to his teammates, Porter also had 15 saves, quashing many of Cal’s opportunities to put up points.
Despite the early lead, the Trojans were not complacent.
“We just keep in mind that it’s never over until the whistle blows,” Maier said. “In [the game against Cal], we let them score a couple of goals in the middle and we kind of picked it back up again. It is difficult, but it’s all mental.”
The Trojan offense took a bit longer to get into the swing of things in Sunday’s non-conference match against UC Irvine, with the Anteaters scoring first. The Trojans soon bounced back with 2 goals of their own to close out the first frame with a 2-1 advantage. In the second period, the Trojans put up 5 unanswered goals to extend their lead to 6 at the half. 
The Trojans’ defense supported their offensive effort. A block, a save and a missed shot at the end of the half all resulted in missed opportunities for UC Irvine which secured a substantial lead.
After redshirt junior driver Daniel Leong netted a goal for the Trojans to open the second half, the Anteaters finally answered with two goals. However, the Trojans quieted the rally with a couple of saves from freshman goalie Sam Krutonog, as well as goals from four different Trojans to close out the third period.
The Trojans’ offensive effort remained strong in the final frame; even though it gave up a pair of goals, USC added 3 more to their total. Despite the slow start for USC, the game ended in a decisive victory for the Trojans with a final score of 15-5.
USC will take on crosstown rival UCLA at Uytengsu Aquatic Center Saturday.

It started with an 8-yard touchdown run by sophomore running back Stephen Carr. Then came a 57-yard dash by senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware, and finally a 41-yard strike from freshman quarterback JT Daniels to freshman receiver Devon Williams. 
Three drives, three touchdowns and a lifeline for USC that it needed badly. The 38-21 road win over Oregon State on Saturday not only kept the Trojans alive in the Pac-12 South, but it also provided temporarily relief for a program that went through a major coaching overhaul last week. 
Gone was offensive line coach Neil Callaway. Head coach Clay Helton finally had enough of Tee Martin calling plays and took the offensive coordinator’s primary duties for himself. The moves were as surprising as they were necessary — the fiercely loyal Helton fired a family friend in Callaway and essentially relegated Martin to being a spotter up in the box. Athletic Director Lynn Swan had to publicly defend Helton, who faced heavy backlash from critics calling for Helton’s termination.
“That’s about as hard a week as you can possibly have,” Helton said.
The tough decisions paid off — for now, at least. If flipping the offensive coaching duties was meant to provide a midseason jolt, then it passed on Saturday. With Helton calling plays for the first time since he was the interim head coach in 2015, the offense had its best all-around performance this season, recording a season-high 509 yards of total offense, as did the run game with 332 yards. 
Ware, who waited four years for a breakout game, finally had his moment with a career-high 205 yards on the ground. He looked like a No. 1 back as he gashed through holes, eluded tackles and turned on the burners. Ware’s dancing exhibition after his third touchdown of the night drew a penalty for excessive celebration, but it was worth it. 
In a season that has been as frustrating as the 5-4 record indicates, this was an enjoyable game for the Trojans. The run game was explosive and the defense had a party in the backfield with six sacks, tying a season-high. During a timeout in the second half, the entire USC sideline erupted as AC/DC’s “T.N.T.” blasted over the loudspeakers at Reser Stadium, waving their arms and jumping up and down.
Considering the criticism and tension that has enveloped the program this season, a never-ending hailstorm that perhaps reached its peak last week, Corvallis, Oregon was exactly what the doctor ordered for some stress relief. 
“In that locker room, we all let out a huge scream, all together, just let out a bunch of frustration,” Helton said.
If you can imagine a group of large, grown men in a locker room all screaming at once, that’s the point we have reached for USC football this season. But this is good. Sports are supposed to be fun, and for the first time this season, it looked like this team was genuinely having fun, playing the game, letting it out.
It’s entirely fair to say this team is heavily underperforming this season, and to rip on each of its mistakes (and there were still plenty on Saturday). But it would be unfair to ignore the human element of it all, the immense pressure the coaches and players face just by donning the Cardinal and Gold and, more specifically, the toll that it must take on Helton to coach week after week like his job is on the line — which, make no mistake, it still very much is.
What Helton did last week was a good first step. He did what a good leader does, prioritizing winning over loyalty by firing a close friend and taking responsibility for an offense that was going nowhere.
Now, this offense — and this team — is at least going somewhere. USC needs help in addition to winning the rest of its conference games, but a Rose Bowl appearance, as incredulous as it sounds, is in play and by no means a stretch considering the mess that is the Pac-12.
Setting aside the lofty, ubiquitous expectations for the moment and that the opponent was Oregon State, Saturday’s result was just about all you could have asked for. So Ware can dance all he wants, the sideline can jump around all it wants and the entire locker room can scream its lungs out. Positive vibes, at long last, may have arrived in the nick of time for the Trojans.
