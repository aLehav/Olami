The Women of Troy lost for the first time this season on the road to No. 20 Oklahoma State, who outshot USC on their way to an 82-51 route.
The Cowgirls (5-0) shot an impressive 47 percent from the field in the first half that put USC (3-1), who shot 35 percent through 20 minutes, in a big hole early. By halftime, the Cowgirls had doubled up Troy at 44-22. USC only recorded two field goals through the first five minutes of play, consisting of two baskets by junior guard Ariya Crook and senior forward Cassie Harberts.
Crook was the only USC player to enter into double digits with 12 points for the game on 5-of-16 shooting. She also struggled from long range, going 2-of-9 from beyond the arc. Harberts and junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama both dropped in eight points a piece. Vaioletama also grabbed a team-high seven rebounds.
Unfortunately for the Women of Troy, Oklahoma State’s hot shooting would carry over to the second half and would finish the game shooting a red-hot 52 percent. USC ended up shooting around 33 percent for the game and would also get beat on the boards, losing the rebounding battle 39 to 29, mainly because the Cowgirls wouldn’t miss very many shots.
Oklahoma State had four players in double figures, led by the 22 points of guard Brittney Martin, who added 10 rebounds as well to give herself a double-double. Center Kendra Suttles would also grab a double-double with 10 points and 11 rebounds.
USC’s poor shooting coupled with the Cowgirls’ offensive outburst resulted in multiple Oklahoma State runs that the Women of Troy were ultimately unable to overcome. They would never hold a lead in the game.
The first of these runs came at the beginning of the game when the Cowgirls jumped out to a 20-4 lead with 12:48 remaining in the first half.
The Women of Troy would fight back before Oklahoma State went on a 12-0 run to further increase the USC deficit to 26 points, 37-11 with a little under five minutes remaining. During that run, USC was held from scoring for just over four minutes.
Turnovers would not help out the Women of Troy either, as 19 of them led to 26 points for Oklahoma State. The Cowgirls had trouble taking care of the ball as well with 13 of their own, but USC struggled to capitalize, turning them into only eight points.
Junior forward Kaneisha Horn, who transferred from Alabama, played her first minutes as a Trojan and went three-of-four from the charity stripe.
Even with the loss, new head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke has USC off to their best start since the 1998-99 season with wins against UC Davis, Fresno State and San Diego State.
“Growth is the goal,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I want our team to get better every game, every practice, so we are peaking at the right time in the season.”
The Women of Troy will return home to face off against another ranked opponent in No. 19-ranked South Carolina Monday at the Galen Center. Tip-off is set for 5 p.m.

This was only the 20th ranked team in the polls. One thing to lose on the road, but routed by 31 with the game
being over after the first seven + minutes is not showing much growth. The team played like they were still at
Mater Dei Highschool with the three alums running the floor. Let’s  see how they rebound vs. the other usc who is
ranked 19th being at home for this game.

Back at the Galen Center for its final home weekend doubleheader, the USC women’s volleyball team avenged its first loss against Arizona and rebounded from a tough Washington trip the weekend prior.
Killer performance · Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu came up big for the Women of Troy this weekend, with 16 kills against Arizona. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The No. 8 Women of Troy (24-5, 14-4 Pac-12) defeated the Arizona Wildcats 3-0 Friday night (25-22, 25-14, 25-21) and then turned back the Arizona State Sun Devils Sunday 3-0 (25-15, 25-15, 25-21). The much-needed victories came after USC dropped consecutive matches for the first time this season.
“I thought our intensity was up and we pushed it much harder,” USC head coach Mick Haley said. “We won most of the long rallies against Arizona, which is very good. We did a very, very good job with the serve and pass game against Arizona State.”
Against the Wildcats, freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu shined once again with 16 kills to lead all players. Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio put together another impressive all-around performance with 10 kills, three service aces and six digs, while senior libero Natalie Hagglund recorded 19 digs.
“It’s always important to be able to redeem ourselves, because losing back-to-back is a hit to the confidence,” Hagglund said. “We came back to play well and Arizona beat us 3-0 at their place, so being able to redeem ourselves was really big for us.”
USC started off slowly in the first set against Arizona and fell behind 5-2, but recovered to take an 8-7 lead before Bricio capped off a thrilling rally for a 14-12 lead. Arizona kept the score close, but the Women of Troy maintained their lead. A Bricio kill put USC up 24-20 and after a small Wildcat rally, the sophomore ended matters with a strong kill down the middle to seal the set 25-22. The Women of Troy managed to win the frame despite being outhit .341 to .327.
Nwanebu recorded three straight kills to open the second set and propel the Women of Troy to a 8-1 lead. The Wildcats started to chip away but a kill by senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard pushed USC’s lead to 11-6. Freshman outside hitter Elise Ruddins joined the party with back-to-back kills to make the advantage 23-14. After an Arizona shot went out of bounds to give USC set point, the Women of Troy won the frame 25-14 when Olgard quickly struck down a Wildcat strike.
The Women of Troy jumped ahead 6-2 in the third frame on a Bricio kill and later went on a 5-0 run capped by a tandem block to go up 12-6. The Wildcats fought back and tied the set 17-all, but USC later went up 22-17 after a Bricio kill and an Arizona error. Nwanebu then finished off the with a strong kill from the right side to conclude the set 25-21 and propel the Women of Troy to their 23rd victory of the season.
The Women of Troy hit .314 for the match and received strong hitting performances from Nwanebu (.432 attacking percentage and no errors) and junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer (seven kills and .600 clip).
“We did a much better job of blocking,” Haley said. “[Outside hitter] Madi Kingdon is having a great year for Arizona and Ebony just got lit up by her in Arizona. She did a great job on Kingdon tonight.”
USC came out firing in the first set against the Sun Devils and took a commanding 18-10 lead after Ruddins knocked down a shot from the left side. Sophomore middle blocker Kiara Wright entered the match after a small ASU rally and put down a quick strike to bring up match point at 24-14. Nwanebu then finished the set with a kill to give USC the 25-15 victory.
The Women of Troy faltered a bit in the second set as they saw a 12-4 lead cut to 13-10. Bricio ended the ASU rally with a kill and Hagglund notched an ace to put USC up 15-10. The Women of Troy then ran away with the set as consecutive kills by Olgard and Ruddins put USC up 22-13. A quick Nwanebu strike brought up set point at 24-14 before an error gave USC another 25-15 win.
The Women of Troy struggled to gain separation in the third set, as the teams played to a 12-12 tie to force a USC timeout. The Sun Devils then capitalized on USC’s mistakes to take a 16-14 lead and later went up 18-15, but the lead was short-lived as USC rattled off three straight points to tie it. USC then displayed its mettle and took four out of five to go up 23-20. A Nwanebu block brought up match point and the freshman then knocked down a strong kill from the right side to finish the set 25-21 and secure USC’s 24th victory.
“We did a really good job of finishing the match,” Ruddins said. “I thought our defense was amazing tonight. We shut down their hitters really well and we channeled the ball for Natalie pretty well.”
USC will have a busy Thanksgiving week as it travels to Westwood to take on rival UCLA Wednesday before finishing the regular season Friday against visiting Colorado.

A year ago, each team involved in the historic USC-UCLA  rivalry came into the schools’ annual showdown on very different terms.
One side had been sparked by a new coach who had brought a renewed sense of energy to the team. Even with a first-year starter at quarterback, they were six games over .500 (8-2) and riding a winning streak that goes back to October. Their only conference blemishes were a blowout loss on the road and an agonizingly close defeat at home.
Of course, I’m talking about the Bruins, coach Jim Mora and quarterback Brett Hundley. I’m quite sure no USC fan would mistake last season’s mess for the above sequence of events. But doesn’t that story line sound awfully familiar?
Well, maybe this scenario will too. After another disappointing loss on Saturday, the Bruins have squandered a season that started with them being picked to win the Pac-12 South in the preseason media poll. Their defense has been ripped apart by mobile quarterbacks such as Oregon’s Marcus Mariota. Their offensive line isn’t performing well (they allowed nine sacks to Arizona State on Saturday), and their quarterback has gone from Heisman hopeful to afterthought.
Yep, that sounds like a narrative Trojan fans have experienced before.
The second half of UCLA’s season hasn’t been quite as disastrous of a plummet as USC’s was a season ago — and the Bruins didn’t start out as highly perched as USC’s 2012 squad was. But the Bruins (8-3) are 3-3 in their last six games after starting the season 5-0, holding a nearly identical record to that of last year’s Trojans (7-3) before USC lost the Battle for Los Angeles.
Now, I’m not saying that USC is a lock to take back the Victory Bell on Saturday and add to their rivals’ misery, as UCLA did a year ago. But the Bruins have been showing the signs of a team that’s ready to cut their losses and fast forward to next season — in Mora’s press conference following his team’s loss to the Sun Devils, he gave what Jack Wang of the Los Angeles Daily News described as “an end-of-season speech.” That’s not exactly what you’d expect to hear from a team that still has a date in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum left on their schedule.
Partially thanks to that home-field advantage, the Trojans will likely be favored to beat UCLA on Saturday and finish the regular season 10-3 — something that would’ve sounded patently ridiculous a month ago.
But if you examine the Bruins, it’s easy to see why they’ve struggled over the past six weeks — and why USC looks poised to switch roles from last year and guide their rivals further through their downward spiral.
UCLA’s problems start with the injury bug. Their offensive line has been decimated to the point that the unit has started three true freshmen over the past four games. Their starting tailback was sidelined a few games ago and they’ve had to turn to freshman linebacker Myles Jack to switch over to offense and give them a boost in the running game.
Jack has certainly helped in that regard, logging six touchdowns over UCLA’s past three games. But he’s an absolute liability in pass protection, and is partially to blame for the Bruins giving up those nine sacks to the Sun Devils. Jack admitted as much after Saturday’s defeat.
“I feel like I struggled,” Jack told the Los Angeles Daily News after the Bruins’ loss. “It’s definitely hard to learn pass pro in what, five days? That’s definitely tough. My experience with pass pro and everything, I had to get pulled out because I’m not reliable in that type of situation.”
Meanwhile, the Trojans are finally getting back to full strength. USC’s pair of redshirt junior tight ends, Xavier Grimble and Randall Telfer, were both more involved in the passing game against Colorado than they had been all season. Grimble caught six passes for 46 yards, both season highs, and Telfer scored his first touchdown of the year.
“Me and my brother Randall, it’s been a rough season for us,” Grimble said. “We weren’t really expecting it, we’ve been hurt. We’re two salty vets; we do whatever we can to help our team. And that’s what we’ve been doing.”
Junior wideout Marqise Lee and senior tailback Silas Redd didn’t travel with the team to Boulder, Colo. this weekend, but those seemed like precautionary decisions — and redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey, one of the team’s most outspoken leaders, seems quite optimistic about their statuses for the UCLA game.
“This is a game where everybody is gonna be back,” Bailey said. “’Qise, Silas — everybody’s gonna be healthy. We’re gonna go out there and y’all are gonna see the Trojans you’ve been seeing out there for seven weeks.”
If the Trojans and Bruins really do continue to play as they have been for the past month and a half, then it’s hard to argue that USC won’t keep on trending upward.

One week after toppling then-No. 5 Stanford behind an unusually powerful passing attack, the Trojans returned to a ground-and-pound strategy headed by redshirt sophomore running back Javorius “Buck” Allen on Saturday night to beat Colorado 47-29.
In sync · Sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler connects with junior tight end Xavier Grimble for one of Grimble’s six receptions in the Trojans’ victory over Colorado. Kessler finished 19-of-28 for 184 yards passing. – Karen Pham | Daily Trojan
USC (9-3, 6-2 Pac-12), however, was still eliminated from the Pac-12 South division title race as Arizona State defeated UCLA 38-33 to clinch its spot in the conference championship game versus Stanford.
“We were hoping things would be a little different, but it’s college football,” redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble said. “As long as we keep winning, things will take care of themselves and we’ll end up somewhere good.”
The Buffs (4-7, 1-7) managed to put up 22 points and double the team’s total yardage in the fourth quarter to make the final score close. But an onside kick recovery followed by a 52-yard touchdown scamper by redshirt sophomore fullback Soma Vainuku put the finishing touch on the Trojans’ fifth straight win, and improved their all-time record against the Buffs to 8-0.
“We were inconsistent with some things, but we won the game and that’s what matters,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said. “We had an emotional game against Stanford and a rivalry game [against UCLA] coming up, so it showed some maturity in our football team to come in here and win.”
Now, it seems next week’s matchup against the Bruins will only determine which rival can claim bragging rights for the next year, as well as possibly define the coaching future of Orgeron, who has guided the Trojans to a 6-1 (6-0 in the Pac-12) record after taking over for former head coach Lane Kiffin.
“We can control winning 10 games, and that’s what we’re worried about,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said. “It is what it is. It makes the game next week that much more personal for us.”
The chilly temperature would seem to help Colorado, given that in school history, the Buffs had been 11-1-1 at home in sub-30 degree weather while USC hadn’t played in those conditions since 1959.
But the Trojan defense was up to the task, as most of the starters left with a 37-7 lead midway through the third quarter, with the lone Colorado touchdown coming off a fumble return. Colorado didn’t run a play in USC’s territory until the 2:40 mark of the second quarter -— and that play resulted in an interception. The Buffaloes’ 63 first-half yards were a season low, as Colorado was shut out in the first half for the first time this year.
The Trojans did an excellent job of blanketing Colorado wideout Paul Richardson, who came in as the fourth-leading receiver nationally (120.1 receiving yards per game) but netted only 88 yards against USC, all of which came in the second half. His first reception came more than halfway through the third quarter, when USC was up 37-7 and the game was well out of hand.
“[Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast] is really good at coming up with schemes to stop big-time receivers,” Bailey said. “All the big-time receivers we’ve played so far, we’ve shut them down way below their game average.”
Neither senior tailback Silas Redd (knee) nor junior wideout Marqise Lee (shin) traveled with the team due to injuries, but the Trojans were just fine on offense without them.
Kessler was his usually efficient self, completing 19 of 28 passes for 184 yards and two touchdowns before sitting out the fourth quarter with a healthy lead.
Allen continued to showcase his explosive talent, amassing 169 all-purpose yards (145 rushing) and three touchdowns on 21 carries and three receptions.
“We came out with a great mindset that we were going to pound the ball,” Allen said. “We struggled a little bit [at first], but as the game went on we picked it up.”
The former fourth-string tailback had his third three-touchdown game this season, and has tallied 619 rushing yards and 10 scores (nine rushing) in the last four weeks.
Allen put the Trojans on the board with an impressive 12-yard touchdown run, taking an outside handoff to the sideline before stretching to touch the pylon.
After USC’s defense pinned the Buffs deep in their own territory, Vainuku came up with his third blocked punt of the year. The ball spun out of the back of the end zone for a safety to put the Trojans up 9-0 with just more than a minute left in the first quarter.
The Trojan defense pressured Colorado freshman quarterback Sefo Liufau all night long, letting the freshman complete just four of 15 passes in the first half. And it paid off midway through the second quarter after USC’s offense had started to lull.
Sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams came up with his sixth sack of the year, forcing a fumble that the Trojans recovered for great field position at the Colorado 20-yard line. Allen punched it in from one yard out a few minutes later to give USC a 16-0 lead.
Earlier in the week, Bailey had said that Liufau tended to “make a lot of freshman throws — overthrows, underthrows, misreading things.” Bailey backed up his talk, coming up with an interception with just more than two minutes left before halftime to preserve USC’s first-half shutout.
From there, the Trojans drove 66 yards in less than two minutes to reach the end zone again before halftime. Sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor reeled in a 20-yard back shoulder throw from Kessler to extend USC’s lead to 23-0 heading into the locker room.
It briefly looked as though Colorado would make a push after the Buffs returned an Allen fumble 33 yards for a touchdown on the first play of the second half. But the Trojans responded with a 7-play, 75-yard drive punctuated by a 10-yard touchdown pass from Kessler to redshirt junior tight end Randall Telfer to reinstate its 23-point cushion and let them cruise to the finish line.

On Friday, the USC Women’s Student Assembly, Undergraduate Student Government and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted the first “Lean In” initiative to get more women involved in student government.
Initiative for civic participation · On Friday, panelists from the “Lean In” event discussed the importance of encouraging women to participate in politics and student government at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
The event featured political consultant Lindsay Bubar and Jessica Lall, the last female student body president USC had in 2005. Lall currently works as executive director at South Park Business Improvement District.
Both spoke about the lack of women involved today at the university, local and state level. According to Bubar, who graduated from USC in 2003, approximately one-third of all women try to talk themselves out of running for office or have had someone tell them a male would do a better job. Bubar said there is only one elected woman in the city of Los Angeles and only 25 percent of the California state legislature is female.
“There’s an ambition gap,” she said. “The problem isn’t that when women run they lose, it’s that women aren’t running.”
For her part, Lall said when she ran for student body president, elections were highly competitive but she didn’t think much about her role as a female president specifically until her running mate for vice president called her over winter break and suggested gender might be a larger factor than she anticipated.
“He called me and said, ‘I think I should be the presidential candidate and you should be my vice president,’” Lall said. “I said, ‘Well give me a good reason,’ and he said, ‘Well when was the last time a woman was elected?’ I was running around a little unaware that people were looking at me being a female as a disadvantage and that was a really clarifying moment.”
Lall instead decided to run as president herself and won, but both she and Bubar — who has served as campaign manager for undefeated congressman Henry Waxman and political director for Wendy Greuel, who lost her bid for Los Angeles mayor — agreed that win or lose, you often learn the most from the campaign experience.
“You’re going about 100 miles down the freeway in a bus trying to put the wheels on but the fear of losing should never hold you back,” Lall said.
One of the most difficult parts of campaigning, Bubar said, can be asking for money. She also said, however, that asking for funding is an important part of the process and people might actually be offended if someone asks for less than they know a particular person can give. Furthermore, she said if their policies align, women have an obligation to support other women in office. Bubar said that at the moment, men donate more to female candidates than women do.
“It’s really important that we support one another,” Bubar said. “The powerbrokers are doing that for men, recruiting men. The boys club is out there.”
Lall emphasized that for people running for student government, no candidate is truly that much more qualified than any other. Despite this seemingly disheartening fact, she said women should not be discouraged from running. Women in leadership positions, however, often face their own set of struggles after the campaign.
During her time as student body president, Lall also served as her sorority president and she said when she accidentally sent out an email about recruitment that included both her titles, many other chapter presidents felt she was using her position to encourage people to rush her sorority.
“Before I knew it, I was in a sorority recruitment citation hearing and I had every single sorority president — people that were my friends — saying I needed to step down as USG president,” she said.
She did not resign, and Lall said the incident proved a valuable learning experience.
“No one is born knowing how to go about this, but you don’t learn if you don’t try,” she said. “I can say that my experience really has prepared me in more ways than one to be in the position I’m in today.”
Bubar said some 40 percent of women currently in Congress were student body presidents.
Kaya Masler, executive co-director of the USC Women’s Assembly, said she hoped the event would help to reinforce the idea that women should be involved in government on campus because only someone with a woman’s perspective can truly understand the issues that women face on campus.
“I think any women’s organization that is at all political has an obligation to support women in politics,” Masler said. “Ultimately, an underrepresented population is an unprotected one.”
Alec White, a sophomore majoring in political science, said he was pleased to see men attend the event because he felt the responsibility of getting a woman elected to office at USC does not just fall on other women.
“Even though I’m a man, getting a woman elected to office at USC is still very important to me,” White said. “I was a little discouraged at first seeing how hard it is for women to be elected, but I think events like these really do spread awareness and it really does help empower them to run.”
Chanelle Yang, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development, is a member of USC’s Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation and is considering running for a position in USG to help influence labor policies. Yang also hopes to one day be mayor of her hometown of Oakland and the advice from Bubar and Lall helped convince her that it was a possibility.
“I didn’t think I had the capacity to take on that kind of leadership position,” Yang said. “But I realize coming to this that that doesn’t matter. I’m still a college student and I still have time to try it out before I step into the real world.”
Editor’s note: This post has been updated to correct the statement about the amount of money men donate to female candidates. The original post mistakenly stated that men give more to charity than women do.

A new study conducted by researchers at the School of Social Work and published in the Journal of Adolescent Health found that adolescents with either a sibling or parent in the military are more likely to report being suicidal or depressed when compared with their peers.
Families have been affected by more and more tours of duty since the country has been at war for more than a decade.
“These are kind of an invisible minority group. Most people in the civilian public kind of pretend we’re not at war, but we’re close to 12 years at war, and many of these kids have experienced parental deployment, war zones, PTSD,” said Ron Avi Astor, a professor of social work and education, and one of the principal architects of the study.
The study was made possible by a large grant from the Department of Defense to provide services and to evaluate what the best practices are in public schools that have students with family members in the military. Astor said there are approximately 1.3 million children in public schools affected and, since 9/11, about 5 million children who have been affected by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Though numerous studies have been conducted about the effects of war, few have focused on its impact on adolescents.
“The reason we chose to look at kids with parents or siblings in the military is because we’ve had a decade of war and we have a lot of information now about the individual deployed and sometimes their partner or spouse but very little information how it impacts adolescent health,” said Julie Cederbaum, assistant professor of social work and lead author of the study.
The researchers collected data in conjunction with the California Healthy Kids Survey, a survey that is administered biannually to all public schools students in fifth, seventh, ninth and 11th grades in public schools receiving Title IV funding. A military supplement was included as part of the survey for eight school districts in California, and both military and non-military students took both parts of the survey.
Almost 25 percent of ninth and 11th-grade students with a military parent and more than 26 percent of students with a military sibling said they had thought about ending their lives, compared with 19.1 percent of non-military students, according to a press release.
“These results are very powerful because they show that, first of all, non-military kids are having problems too, there are lot of suicidal teenagers across California,” Astor said.
Cederbaum said she was surprised to learn that each additional tour of duty further impacted mental health.
“Some of these families have had four deployments, five deployments, six deployments,” Astor said. “We’ve never had wars like that in our history where one family has had to sacrifice so much.”
One policy change that has already been implemented as a result of the study is that schools are beginning to identify military adolescents within their communities.
Starting in the 2012-2013 school year, students taking the survey will be able to check a box that will identify them as connected to the military.
Cederbaum said such data will allow schools and health professionals to better target their resources and support. Astor, however, added that it’s important to avoid attaching a stigma to these students and targeting them individually, but rather to use the data to highlight the importance of the issue to parents and educators.
“If you’re a [teacher] in a high school classroom and you know that 27 percent of the kids in your class are from military families have thought about committing suicide and have a plan, then it’s not an abstract number from a study in Iowa. These are kids right in front of you,” Astor said. “What meaning does that math test have then?”
Both Cederbaum and Astor spoke about the importance of teaching parents, educators and peers about military culture as well as mental health issues and how to deal with adolescents who are depressed or suicidal.
“It’s about providing a climate and an atmosphere where people know what the resources where friends and families know what to do, where parents and educators know how to handle it when large numbers of kids are saying they don’t want to live anymore,” Astor said.
Cederbaum said more schools can implement things such as “transition rooms,” resource centers that are particularly beneficial for military students who often have to move frequently between schools.
Astor also stressed the importance of having counselors and social work experts in schools addressing the issues of depression and suicide so kids don’t “fall through the cracks.” He said the focus should be on educating peers, parents and teachers about the resources available, not about screening or identifying.
“The percentages don’t seem to be changing. They’re crying out and it’s pretty cynical as a society to ask these kinds of questions [about suicide] in detail in the classroom, and then not provide the resources or help to educate the peers, the parents and the community about what to do about it,” he said.

Hmm it looks like your blog ate my first comment (it was super long) so I guess I’ll just sum it up what I wrote and say, I’m thoroughly enjoying your blog. I too am an aspiring blog writer but I’m still new to the whole thing. Do you have any recommendations for beginner blog writers? I’d certainly appreciate it.

From Nov. 22 to Dec. 1, the USC Racing Team, a student organization that models and builds a racecar from scratch every year, will showcase a car they built this year at the Los Angeles Auto Show.

The team is mainly comprised of engineering majors from the Vitberi School of Engineering. The project is an opportunity for students to apply what they’ve learned in the classroom in real life. The group is one of 80 that compete in the Formula Society of Automotive Engineers car competition in Lincoln, Neb. every summer.
Though the Formula SAE is a small competition between teams from other universities, team members said presenting their car at the L.A. Auto Show is a great chance to get the word out about the group.
“It shows people who aren’t familiar with the competition what cool and exciting things students at USC are working on,” said Sean Summers, a representative for the USC Racing Team. “It gives the team a large sense of pride knowing that their hard work is being viewed and appreciated by thousands of people, and that we have the chance to represent the school.”
Summers said it takes around 11 to 12 months for the team to finish the car, which they build in their “shop” in Parking Structure A. The team is never truly finished with the car, however, as they are constantly trying to improve its design and functionality. The team designs an entirely new car every year, with each successive car focusing on fixing and improving the shortcomings of the last one, as well as pushing the team’s technological and modeling boundaries.
Though no prizes are given at the L.A. Auto Show, the event symbolizes the culmination of a lot of hard work for the team.
“The L.A. Auto Show really boosts morale for the team, and shows everyone that our team is bigger than just a campus club,” Summers said. “We are important in the real world. This is experience and work that the auto industry appreciates and respects.”
The team said they often feel a special bond with their car because they spend many hours designing and building the model. They also name each car. This year, they’ve chosen the moniker “Kimi.”
The team members said they encountered many problems along the way in the building process, but that overcoming those made them a stronger and more unified team.
“As a member for three years, I have learned a great deal that will prepare me for working in nearly any facet of engineering,” said Jason Zide, the team’s project manager. “Displaying our car at the L.A. Auto Show is a great way to demonstrate the abilities of the school, making the team and the school proud.”
The team members agreed that seeing the end product is the best, most rewarding part of being on the team.
“The best part is seeing the fruits of your labor,” Summers said. “It’s an invaluable, real life application of engineering that class doesn’t always provide. Seeing something you made from scratch actually work, and then compete, is a special feeling.”

With the palm trees and sunshine, the vibrant city and colorful weekends, it’s easy to feel like we’re on vacation every day of the year here in Los Angeles.
At its core, though, USC is an academic institution that boasts Nobel laureates, produces world-changing research and hosts professors whose names are etched in history. But with prestige comes pressure and undoubtedly, students at USC will be feeling the pressure to excel as the semester comes to a close.
As we return from Thanksgiving break, we’ll find ourselves smack dab in the middle of the time of year when clothes go unwashed, dishes soak for days, Club Leavey’s at maximum capacity and textbooks serve as pillows.
So remember this, my friends, as we buckle down to finish strong: pain is temporary. GPA? That’s forever. Check out these lyric-free songs that will boost your productivity and your mood right in time for your exams.
“Hey, Soul Sister,” “Fidelity” and “Anyone Else But You” — Vitamin String Quartet

Given any overwhelming day of work, Vitamin String Quartet albums are my go-to collection. Find refuge in their masterful renditions of popular songs. From throwback numbers such as Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance” to 2013 hits such as Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky,” you name it— they’ve covered it. Hailing from our very own City of Angels, VSQ started in 1999. Since then, they’ve released more than 200 albums honoring musicians such as The Beatles and Queen.
“Without You” and “Peponi (Paradise)” — The Piano Guys

Pianist Jon Schmidt and cellist Steven Sharp Nelson launched the Piano Guys group in St. George, Utah, gaining fame through YouTube. Since their humble beginnings, the duo has expanded into a larger collective of talents including studio engineer Paul Anderson, writer Al Van Der Beek and videographer Tel Stewart. Their first album was released in December 2011 and their second album, eponymously titled The Piano Guys, soared to number one on the Billboard New Age Albums chart. In Peponi, The Piano Guys give Coldplay’s “Paradise” an African flair and in their cover of Coldplay’s “Without You” they put a classical spin on a contemporary classic.
“Things Were Going So Well” and “Art Gallery”— Mychael Danna and Rob Simonsen

(500) Days of Summer, a comedy-drama featuring doe-eyed Zooey Deschanel and the baby-faced Joseph Gordon-Levitt, quickly became a cult classic after its 2009 release.
Couples flocked to the Angel’s Knoll in Downtown L.A. to visit the iconic park bench featured in the film. Unfortunately, city officials shut down the famous tourist spot due to budget cuts this fall. But at least we still have the soundtrack to enjoy. “Art Gallery” is carried by whimsical ukulele strumming while “Things Were Going So Well” blends piano and violin to produce a rich palette of sounds.
“I Want You,” “iPlayYouListen” and “How Did I Get Here” — Odesza

Harrison Mills and Clayton Knight describe their music as “dreamy sun trickled melodies, glitches out vocals, crunchy drums and large sweeping basslines” and there is frankly no better way to put it. By seamlessly blending vibrant sounds, their electronic mixes bring a sense of composure to any troubled mind. These tracks are also an excellent departure from the aforementioned classical melodies.
“The Magician” — Howard Shore

Movie soundtracks have the ability to transport the listener to an entirely different realm. Martin Scorsese’s 2011 drama, Hugo, brought viewers into the Parisian world of Hugo Cabret. Canadian composer Howard Shore, whose scores have earned numerous Academy Award nominations and wins, created this tune that will sweep you away.
His books continue to reach new readers every day, and as he grows as a writer, his work continues to expand both intellectually and affirmatively.

Conquest, the annual concert and pep rally in anticipation of the USC vs. UCLA rivalry game, will celebrate its 10th year on Monday at 7 p.m. at McCarthy Quad.
Whatcha say · Jason DeRulo will perform alongside the Song Girls, Trojan Dance Force, Chaotic 3 and the Trojan Marching Band at the 10th annual Conquest concert hosted by Heather McDonald and Steve Rannazzisi. – Photo courtesy of WBR Press
The Concerts Committee within Program Board paired up with the Office of Campus Activities paired up to put on the event, working together to bring the community together and celebrate what it means to be Trojan.
“We want to have a fun and exciting event. Something that pumps up the students and really gets them rallied for the game against UCLA,” said Stephanie Aristakesian, executive director of the Concerts Committee.
The annual pep rally and concert traditionally attracts 7,000 to 10,000 people and features a celebration of the athletics teams, a ceremonial burning of a Bruin effigy, food trucks, fireworks, a Ferris wheel and a concert. Student groups and the Office of Campus Activities have been working to make this event feasible since last spring.
It has become a well-loved tradition on the USC campus.
“We call it ‘Conquest: the ultimate Trojan experience’ because we try to encapsulate the entire experience of what it is to be a Trojan,” said Lily Chowana-Bandhu, director of campus activities.
In departure from their typical genre choices, the Concerts Committee and Office of Campus Activities chose a mainstream pop artist as the headliner.
Chowana-Bandhu said they chose Jason DeRulo because they believed he would appeal to a wider audience and put on a show that many people could enjoy.
“He had taken a hiatus, and it’s really cool for him to pick up where his music left off at USC. I’m excited about his performance,” said Christina Mireles, program manager for the Office of Campus Activities.
This year, Conquest will also feature two hosts instead of one: Heather McDonald and Steve Rannazzisi. McDonald is a USC alumna and regularly appears on the comedy talk show Chelsea Lately. Rannazzisi is best known for his role as Kevin on FX’s The League.
But the biggest surprise in store for students who attend Conquest is a new pyrotechnic method of lighting the UCLA bruin on fire.
“It’s going to be a lot more impactful. And really, really cool. I’m not sure if I’m allowed to say more,” Aristakesian said.
A goal of Conquest is also to celebrate community, and other milestones in Trojan history such as 125 years of Trojan athletics and 45 years of the world famous USC Song Girls.
The USC Song Girls will open up the show. There will also be performances by Chaotic 3, Trojan Dance Force and the Trojan Marching Band.
One of the greatest parts about Conquest, Chowana-Bandhu pointed out, is how numerous student groups work together to put on a massive event for the entire community to enjoy and celebrate the Trojan spirit.
“It’s really cool to see everyone come together and work together. It’s really amazing,” Mireles said.
Conquest will celebrate Trojan athletics by honoring the soccer, baseball, volleyball, swimming, diving and football teams and giving senior members an opportunity to speak and be recognized for their achievements.
To further honor the Trojan community, The Order of the Torch members are also being recognized. They will reveal this year’s Mr. and Mrs. USC.
“[Conquest] is a community building experience,” Chowana-Bandhu said. “It’s one of the events that is a great opportunity for students to visually experience Trojan pride.”
Students must show valid student ID at the Von Kleinsmid Center in order to attend. Non-USC students must be a guest of a student and also provide a valid form of identification.
Alumni and community members also welcome, and can check in near Parking Structure X.
“This is the 10th anniversary and we’re hoping to make it the biggest Conquest in Trojan history so far,” Aristakesian said.

Black Nativity is a contemporary adaptation of the 1961 Langston Hughes play of the same name, which tells the biblical story of the Nativity. The holiday musical follows Langston (Jacob Latimore), a 15-year-old boy from Baltimore raised by his single mother, and his journey to New York City to spend Christmas with his estranged relatives Reverend Cornwell and Aretha Cobbs (Forest Whitaker and Angela Bassett). Unfamiliar with their religious way of life and unwilling to compromise, Jacob is desperate to get back to his mother Naima (Jennifer Hudson). Through this experience, Jacob learns the importance of family and faith.
Lemmons’ memories of the original play and her love of Langston Hughes is what compelled her to adapt this story.
“I have these wonderful childhood memories with the acting and the music, the dance and so I was drawn to wanting to do a film version of Black Nativity,” Lemmons told the Daily Trojan. “It was for nostalgic reasons and because I’m a huge fan of Langston Hughes and I was really just drawn to it because Langston was drawn to it.”
The Black Nativity story was also important to Lemmons on a more personal level, as her sister died while she was writing the script.
“I wouldn’t have been able to go back to it, in fact I didn’t know I would be able to write this at all,” Lemmons said. “The fact that it was an inspiring story to tell, it was the story that my sister loved … so this story got me through a really hard time.”
Lemmons said she applied the same concept of holding true to faith that appears in Black Nativity to her own hardships.
“Because I was working on something that … had real questions of faith, … and lives are complicated and when tragedy happens,” Lemmons said. “It was a question that I felt very connected to.”
Some of her most noted films, such as 1997’s Eve’s Bayou, take on a much darker tone and subject matter than Black Nativity, a PG-rated film. With Black Nativity, Lemmons said she took on a challenge in writing a script that appealed to audiences of all ages.
“I make R-rated films, you know? So it was a different kind of process,” Lemmons said. “It was challenging and I looked forward to the challenge and I embrace the challenge, you know what I mean? I was going for it.”
Despite the differences in subject matter, Lemmon said she still feels both Black Nativity and Eve’s Bayou are similar in the perspectives they portray.
“Both of those films are told through childhood perspectives,” Lemmon said. “So they’re both kind of looking at the world through the eyes of a young person and that’s one thing and I think a few of my films deal with something beyond the concert world.”
Though Lemmons said writing from Langston’s perspective was the most difficult, it was also the part she enjoyed the most.
“The hardest thing was writing a 15-year-old boy that doesn’t swear, that was really challenging and making it sound realistic,” Lemmons said. “That was the challenge and it was something I looked forward to. It’s not necessarily a trend in my life, it’s something that I embraced fully for this project.“
The biblical element of the film was also something Lemmons was familiar with.  Capturing the realism in that aspect of the film is something Lemmons believes is the key to the film’s success.
“I know [the biblical aspect] is in my DNA. I wanted to get the church aspects of it right because when I see movies that don’t get it right, it bothers me,” Lemmons said. “So I wanted it to be real, you know? This was really a reverend, this is really his church, I wasn’t making fun of [Black Nativity], I was embracing it, trying to give breath to it.”
While Lemmons kept a lot of the score from the original play, she also added a few original songs written by songwriter Raphael Saadiq that the director feels will add something extra to the story.
“I knew if I partnered with the right musicians and musical director for the film, we could really do something great,” Lemmons said. “What you are going to hear when you see this movie is some great music. Everything has been kind of merged: R&B, hip-hop to gospel. It was really fun to me.”
Lemmons said one original song in particular will be something for the audience to look forward to.
“[“Test of Faith”] is a beautiful song sung by one of the talented singers of our time and [Hudson] is just tremendously talented,” Lemmons said. “I find it very, very moving, and I think the audience will too. “
Black Nativity comes to theaters Nov. 27.

After a year of secret talks between the United States and Iran, an interim deal was reached between Iran and six world powers Sunday aimed at slowing Tehran’s nuclear program, according to CNN. In what President Barack Obama called “an important first step,” the six-month agreement will put an effective freeze on Iran’s nuclear program, from halting Iran’s enrichment capabilities beyond five percent to converting its 20 percent enriched uranium stockpile to uranium oxide, thus making it incapable of being used for military purposes. In return, the current sanctions on Iran’s oil revenues, precious metals and auto industry  will be eased, with the remainder of the sanctions remaining firmly in place, according to CNN. This more diplomatic move has been met with a fierce overreaction from Israel, prompting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to dub the agreement a “historic mistake,” and liken it to the widely hailed diplomatic agreement with North Korea that proved ultimately ineffective, as North Korea conducted its first nuclear test a year later.
But North Korea is not Iran, and this deal is not a form of the international community condoning a nuclear Iran — far from it. Rather, it is an opportunity for both Iran and the West to take concrete steps in improving what has since been shaky relations. Absent of a diplomatic agreement, increased sanctions would only have alienated Iran further, which in turn could easily lead the already uneasy region into a further destabilizing situation.
Though Israel’s skepticism is understandable, their reaction to the agreement has been blown out of proportion. The deals’ fiercest critics have called the agreement a free pass to Iranian nuclear enrichment, but what they don’t understand is that this deal comes with strings — taut strings. In a nationally televised address late Saturday night, Obama reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to halting a nuclear Iran, threatening to “turn off the relief and ratchet up the pressure” if Iran were to violate any of the terms of the deal.
And while many have argued that security can only be reached through sanctions, they are quick to forget that it was only a few months ago that U.S. diplomacy led to a resolution ridding Syria of its chemical weapons arsenal that calmed Israeli fears of a Syrian chemical attack. Fast forward a couple of months, and Israel’s distribution of gas masks is expected to be significantly reduced.
Meanwhile, the very definition of this agreement is “interim” — there’s nothing permanent. Rather, the next six months are meant to be negotiated. Put simply, if Iran and the remaining P5+1 nations can’t strike a permanent treaty, then there’s nothing lost. Instead of attacking a deal that has only begun to be discussed, Israel should be supporting negotiations that can ultimately lead to its future security. Rather than prematurely attack an agreement that has yet to be finalized, it’s in both the United States’ and Israel’s interests to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon. And if it can be done diplomatically — even better.
Both Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry recognize that this “historic” first step is exactly that — a first step. Such steps will likely be more and more of an uphill battle as the six months progress. But as Sir Winston Churchill once famously said, “To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war.” If real, committed diplomacy is an option, than that is one all parties involved should implement.

“Islam is as dangerous in a man as rabies in a dog” Winston Churchill
Churchill knew Chamberlains deal with Hitler was not worth the paper it was written on and if alive today Churchill would know the same thing about this deal with Iran.
Don,  my response to the article qas not an attack on Yasmeen. Perhaps you didn’t have your coffee thi smorning before commenting. Are you her Journalism class professor? Your reponse sounds like a comment on a report card.  Geez.
And you believe verythingj you hear on CNN, MSNBC and NBC, too?
Haven’t you folks learned, through many examples since obama has been a public figure, that you cannot trust anything he says? I trust Bibi way more than I trust the compulsove liar in the White House. 
Obama has lied to the American people over Fast and furious, IRS-gate, NSA spying,, the ACA, Benghazi, and countless other campaigns logans used to manipulate the low information voter. Don’t be one. Go out and listen to other news sources other than thoise owned by Obama’s propaganda machine. 
From the words of a  great poet, Freddie mercury…. “open your eyes, look to the sky and see”!
Good luck.
Btw. Netanyahu is right. The US, under the  “leadership” of two traitors, Obama and John Kerry, have given the far m away again.
Yasmeen Serhan wrote a nice opinion piece. Her writing is clear and reflects her positive regard for others, her liberal outlook, her faith in the President and her willingness to view the Iranian government as wanting to pursue peace. Very nice. I do not attack her, but my opinions differ. I think we are seeing another Munich Conference. I think the Iranians are hurting from the sanctions and pushing for time to achieve nuclear weapons. They will talk sweet to gullible, desperate, Western leaders to get relief and more time. If Iran defaults on it’s own schedule, as I am certain it will, Western leaders will not have the stomachs to reimpose sanctions.
So what will happen? One morning the Presidential Press Secretary will gravely release the news that US Air Force satellites and ground sensors have detected a nuclear test shot in the Kavier-e-Lut desert of Iran. At that point, any remaining sanctions will be dropped as irrelevant. Then, the US and other Western nations will have to accept the fact of a nuclear armed and dangerous Iran, just as they accepted the USSR, China and North Korea.

President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai discussed the future of U.S. military involvement in the country last week with the loya jirga, a 2,500-person council of tribal leaders and influential Afghans. The loya jirga discussed the U.S. military agreement to allow troops to stay in the country in a combat role, rather than just an advisory and training capacity. That agreement is the only hope of a Taliban-free future for Afghanistan. On Sunday, the council voted to have Karzai sign the agreement, but the president is now announcing that he would prefer not to sign until after the presidential elections in April. Unfortunately, Karzai’s political games are interfering with the future of his country.
Mollie Berg | Daily Trojan
Installed first as a puppet leader after the fall of the Taliban in 2001, Karzai has been nothing but trouble for U.S. interests. The United States installed Karzai as Afghanistan’s leader without popular support and continues to rely on him. The election of 2009, which was riddled with low voter turnout, a lack of security and widespread voter fraud, saw Karzai emerge victorious despite low popularity before the election. The problem for Karzai is that he doesn’t have popular support yet. In the tribal-based society, the Afghan central government doesn’t have much to do with the day-to-day operations or leadership in most of the country. Thus, Karzai playing political games and holding up continued U.S. involvement gives him some ability to appear more important than he actually is.
The political theater in which Karzai is engaged in is only aided by the vital importance of the agreement between the United States and Afghanistan for both parties. The war in Afghanistan is now the longest-running U.S. conflict and a war in which the United States has fully engaged despite general dislike toward the conflict. Yet the United States cannot withdraw from Afghanistan without massive security consequences for the region. The United States is essentially stuck between a rock and hard place in Afghanistan, as the American people no longer have the will to continue the fight, but a withdrawal would further harm U.S. interests in the area and regional security. U.S. troops cannot be in Afghanistan without Karzai’s approval, especially after the upcoming end of the NATO mission in 2014, but the United States cannot pull out.
Karzai holds enormous power over the United States at this critical juncture. For Afghanistan, this decision is mostly about security. Because the United States has been responsible for a long and bloody conflict with high civilian casualties in the Afghan view, U.S. involvement has revitalized the Taliban movement by causing many otherwise moderate Afghans to join with the insurgent group. Though many of these moderates would likely disassociate themselves with the Taliban if U.S. troops leave, more extreme factions of the Taliban have been able to use the force given to them by moderate fighters to take control of various regions of the country. This phenomenon is especially prevalent in the Hindu Kush and the area bordering Waziristan, and creates security concerns for both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Karzai has the power to dictate the amount of U.S. presence in these areas, and allowing some U.S. forces to remain in the country is the only way to curb continued Taliban expansion throughout Afghanistan and into Pakistan.
The only way forward for Afghanistan at this point is to allow U.S. troops to currently stay in the country for the time being. As the Foreign Policy Journal stated in a recent article, Afghanistan is not yet ready to step up and take security into its own hands. Troop training is too far behind schedule and the Afghan army lacks the ability to take out high value targets. Furthermore, there are not enough police forces to enforce sustained peace in the areas that have already been freed from Taliban control, and corruption within the Karzai regime continues to give the Taliban the inside scoop on coalition forces’ deployment strategies. Though U.S. involvement has made a mockery of counterinsurgency warfare and resulted in increased casualties, only continued U.S. presence has a chance of restoring peace to the battered area.
Karzai has set himself up well for this political maneuvering. He stands with far less to lose than the United States or the tribal leaders without an arrangement, so his ablility to affect U.S. involvement gives him power. Unfortunately, for Karzai to continue to hold this power, Afghanistan has to lose.

Mr Dan Mogan Russell, I am afraid I question your diligence in producing this article!!!
For you to know why, I copy a paragraph of your contradictory article here:
”  Karzai holds enormous power over the United States at this critical juncture. For Afghanistan, this decision is mostly about security. Because the United States has been responsible for a long and bloody conflict with high civilian casualties in the Afghan view, U.S. involvement has revitalized the Taliban movement by causing many otherwise moderate Afghans to join with the insurgent group.

Karzai has the power to dictate the amount of U.S. presence in these areas, and allowing some U.S. forces to remain in the country is the only way to curb continued Taliban expansion throughout Afghanistan and into Pakistan.”
Just a simple question:
When you believe the US has exacerbated the security situation in Afghanistan for the past 12 years, and the presence of temporary US military forces in Afghanistan , even though it was sanctioned by United Nations, has caused the Taliban to recruit more fighters, then how you also believe that by enforcement of this Security Agreement that allows US to establish her Military Base in Afghanistan  She will be able to make Afghanistan secure? Or you believe that the US purposely exacerbated the Security Situation in Afghanistan as game to achieve its ultimate goal , i,e Occupation of Afghanistan by  consent of the already threatened Afghan Nation.
The people of Afghanistan have spoken loud and clear in Loya Jirga last week and that matters not what the leader and politicians are saying .
All these matters may or may not be entirely correct but the un ethical langaugae used by author by calling our president “a puppet” and insulting him by saying he is nothing , is a real shame. Please emphasize more on your moral values rather than suspicious facts. Thank you.

One week after toppling then-No. 5 Stanford behind an unusually powerful passing attack, the Trojans returned to a ground-and-pound strategy headed by redshirt sophomore running back Javorius “Buck” Allen on Saturday night to convincingly beat Colorado 47-29.
USC (9-3, 6-2), however, was still eliminated from the Pac-12 South division title race as Arizona State defeated UCLA 38-33 to clinch its spot in the conference championship game versus Stanford.
“We were hoping things would be a little different, but it’s college football,” redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble said. “As long as we keep winning, things will take care of themselves and we’ll end up somewhere good.”
The Buffs (4-7, 1-7) managed to put up 22 points and double its total yardage in the fourth quarter to make the final score close. But an onside kick recovery followed by a 52-yard touchdown scamper by redshirt sophomore fullback Soma Vainuku put the finishing touch on the Trojans’ fifth straight win, and improved their all-time record against the Buffs to 8-0.
“We were inconsistent with some things, but we won the game and that’s what matters,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said. “We had an emotional game against Stanford and a rivalry game [against UCLA] coming up, so it showed some maturity in our football team to come in here and win.”
Now, it seems next week’s matchup against the Bruins will only determine which rival can claim bragging rights for the next year, as well as possibly define the coaching future of interim head coach Ed Orgeron, who has guided the Trojans to a 6-1 (6-0 in the Pac-12) record after taking over for former head coach Lane Kiffin.
“We can control winning 10 games, and that’s what we’re worried about,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said. “It is what it is. It makes the game next week that much more personal for us.”
The chilly temperature would seem to help Colorado, given that in school history the Buffs had been 11-1-1 at home in sub-30 degree weather while USC hadn’t played in those conditions since 1959.
But the Trojan defense was up to the task, as most of the starters left with a 37-7 lead midway through the third quarter, with the lone Colorado touchdown coming off a fumble return. Colorado didn’t run a play in USC’s territory until the 2:40 mark of the second quarter – and that play resulted in an interception. The Buffaloes’ 73 first-half yards were a season low, as Colorado was shut out in the first half for the first time this year.
The Trojans did an excellent job of blanketing Colorado wideout Paul Richardson, who came in as the fourth-leading receiver nationally (120.1 receiving yards per game) but netted only 88 yards against USC, all of which came in the second half. His first reception came over halfway through the third quarter, when USC was up 37-7 and the game was well out of hand.
“[Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast] is really good at coming up with schemes to stop big-time receivers,” Bailey said. “All the big-time receivers we’ve played so far, we’ve shut them down way below their game average.”
Neither senior tailback Silas Redd (knee) nor junior wideout Marqise Lee (shin) traveled with the team due to injuries, but the Trojans were just fine on offense without them.
Kessler was his usual efficient self, completing 19 of 28 passes for 184 yards and two touchdowns before sitting out the fourth quarter with a healthy lead.
Allen continued to showcase his explosive talent, amassing 169 all-purpose yards (145 rushing) and three touchdowns on 21 carries and three receptions.
“We came out with a great mindset that we were going to pound the ball,” Allen said. “We struggled a little bit [at first], but as the game went on we picked it up.”
The former fourth-string tailback had his third three-touchdown game this season, and has tallied 619 rushing yards and 10 scores (nine rushing) in the last four weeks.
Allen put the Trojans on the board with an impressive 12-yard touchdown run, taking an outside handoff to the sideline before stretching to touch the pylon.
After USC’s defense pinned the Buffs deep in their own territory, redshirt sophomore fullback Soma Vainuku came up with his third blocked punt of the year. The ball spun out of the back of the end zone for a safety to put the Trojans up 9-0 with just over a minute left in the first quarter.
The Trojan defense pressured Colorado freshman quarterback Sefo Liufau all night long, letting the freshman complete just four of 15 passes in the first half. And it paid off midway through the second quarter after USC’s offense had started to lull.
Sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams came up with his sixth sack of the year, forcing a fumble that the Trojans recovered for great field position at the Colorado 20-yard line. Allen punched it in from one yard out a couple minutes later to give USC a 16-0 lead.
Earlier in the week, redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey had said that Liufau tended to “make a lot of freshman throws — overthrows, underthrows, misreading things.” Bailey backed up his talk, coming up with an interception with just over two minutes left before halftime to preserve USC’s first-half shutout.
From there, the Trojans drove 66 yards in less than two minutes to reach the end zone again before halftime. Sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor reeled in a 20-yard back shoulder throw from Kessler to extend USC’s lead to 23-0 heading into the locker room.
It briefly looked as though Colorado would make a push after the Buffs returned an Allen fumble 33 yards for a touchdown on the first play of the second half. But the Trojans responded with a 7-play, 75-yard drive punctuated by a 10-yard touchdown pass from Kessler to redshirt junior tight end Randall Telfer to reinstate their 23-point cushion and let them cruise to the finish line.

They doubled the points in the fourth off our 2nd string and they kept their starters in.  Please dont misrepresent the game.
A final score of 47-29 is not “close.”
