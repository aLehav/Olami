Senior forward Chevez Goodwin led USC, snatching a career-high 18 rebounds, while adding a team high 14 points. 
It was the first time the Trojans shot under 40% from the field this season, but their rebounding kept them in the game. USC totaled 47 rebounds, with 18 on the offensive end. 
Junior forward Isaiah Mobley had a quiet second half but tied the game at 50 apiece late in the half with a baseline drive to the basket. Both teams traded baskets until Goodwin and junior forward Max Agbonkpolo sealed the deal for the Trojans. 
After a miss from senior guard Drew Peterson, Goodwin got the rebound, pivoted and laid the ball in for two points. Goodwin then blocked a dunk attempt from freshman forward Tristan da Silva. With USC up 57-56, Goodwin was fouled by Colorado. He went 1-2 from the line, sealing the win. 
At times, both teams looked sloppy, turning the ball more than 16 times each. Colorado sophomore forward Jabari Walker had a game-high 5 turnovers. However, Walker was the Buffs’ leading scorer with 13 points, 6 of which came from behind the 3-point line. 
An early shooting foul on Peterson led to a da Silva free throw. Transfer junior guard Boogie Ellis scored the first field goal of the game, which occurred over two minutes into the matchup. 
Peterson and Ellis got into foul trouble early, each committing 2 personal fouls in the first half. Peterson struggled to get into his groove and went the entire first half without a basket, shooting 1-7 from the field in the game. Ellis shot well from the field and made it to the line twice on his way to an 11 point game. 
Colorado closed out the first half with an 8-4 run, led by senior forward Evan Battey, who had 7 points and 4 rebounds in the first 20 minutes of the game. Battey shot a deep 2-pointer to bring the Buffs within 2 points of USC. 
Ellis responded with a diving lay-up, but was called for an offensive foul. The Trojans had three offensive fouls in the first half. After a foul from Goodwin, Parker tied the game at 25 from the free throw line. 
Goodwin’s activity on the offensive boards defined the second half. After a quiet first half, the power forward had a hot start to the second, with Peterson finding Goodwin in the paint three times for the easy bucket. 
Colorado sophomore guard Nique Clifford had, arguably, the play of the game, with a powerful dunk over Peterson to brief scoring drought from the Buffs. 
A few minutes after Ellis was called for his fourth personal foul, Colorado hit back-to-back 3-point shots to take the lead. Sophomore guard Luke O’Brien and Clifford both benefited off of the fast break in order to hit their shots. 
Colorado made 46.7% of their 3-point shots. The team is shooting only 33% behind the arc this season. Da Silva and Walker led Colorado with two 3-pointers apiece. 
USC improves to 15-2 on the season and will travel to Salt Lake City to face Utah Saturday.

Amid their fluctuating record in the Pac-12, women’s basketball fell to UCLA in a crosstown showdown at the Pauley Pavilion 66-43. 
Despite out-rebounding the Bruins in a heavily-contested bout, costly turnovers and inefficiency from the field during the first half created a 13-point deficit entering the third quarter and subsequently placed the game out of reach, culminating in a 23-point defeat. 
UCLA graduate student forward IImari’i Thomas dominated the paint in her own right by collecting 7 rebounds and notching 20 points on 9-for-14 from the field. 
The Bruins’ defense quelled USC’s offense, keeping them under 28% from the field and 12% from beyond the arc, a far cry from the team season average of 44% and 36%, respectively. 
Although UCLA struggled in the first-half from behind the arc, only shooting 20%, the Bruins doubled their 3-point output after halftime as they converted four triples compared to USC’s sole 3-pointer. 
UCLA’s offense translated to multiple streams of scoring, as three Bruins finished the game with double-digit points. 
“We don’t feel good in our locker room. I don’t think that’s who we are or who we want to be,” said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb in a post-game press conference. “[UCLA] beat us in the toughness category. I thought they were ready to go. I thought we spent a lot of the game on our heels.”
Sophomore forward Jordyn Jenkins led USC in scoring and rebounding, recording a 17-point and 11 rebound double-double on 7-11 from the field. Jenkins was the only Trojan in double digits in her final game at Pauley Pavillion. 
Despite Jenkins efforts, UCLA’s defense kept USC at bay. 
“[UCLA’s] pressure kind of had us a little frazzled on offense, and we got a lot of turnovers because of it,” Jenkins said. “So I think now that we saw it, we can kind of get better at it and just make better passes and just be a better team offensively.” 
USC’s inefficient night coalesced with detrimental turnovers, as the Trojans committed 16 and 11 turnovers in respective halves. UCLA took advantage of USC’s lost possessions as they scored 21 of their 66 points as a result of turnovers compared to USC’s 6. 
Despite an impressive performance at the free-throw line, converting 9 of their 11 attempts compared to UCLA’s 4 from 6, the Trojans struggled in spacing as they only converted 2 three-pointers from 17 occasions. 
“As bad as we feel and sort of embarrassed as I am, I am also excited to play this team again in a couple of days,” Gottlieb said. “To me, I don’t think it’s errors — miles and miles of gap — we just need to be ourselves more. Credit to them, they won the game, and we’ll be ready on Sunday.” 
The Trojans will return to Galen Center Sunday and host the Bruins in hopes of clinching redemption after Thursday evening’s loss. The game tips off at 6 p.m.

Former UCLA assistant coach Jane Alukonis has been named as women’s soccer head coach for the upcoming season, USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn announced in a media release Thursday. Replacing former head coach Keidane McAlpine following his eight years with the Trojans, Alukonis joins as  the team’s fifth head coach in 29 years.
After winning back-to-back Pac-12 titles with the Bruins and finishing undefeated in last season’s conference play, Alukonis aims to help the Trojans win the eventual season in a competitive conference. 
“As a talented athlete and coach, Jane brings a winning pedigree and the highest level of competitiveness to our program,” said  Bohn in the media release Thursday. “Her familiarity with both the Pac-12 Conference and the California recruiting landscape is a tremendous asset as we aim to return to the podium as national champions.” 
Hailing from Cocoa Beach, Fla., Alukonis’ experience and soccer expertise dates back to collegiate play. Playing as a defender/midfielder for Duke’s women’s soccer program, Alukonis started 76 of her 84 total matches from 2006-2009, finishing her last season as first-team captain and a four-time ACC Honor Roll nominee. 
Prior to joining UCLA’s program, Alukonis served as the head coach of the Space Coast United U-10, U-11 and U-16 girls club teams and earned an UEFA B Coaching License. 
During Alukonis’ UCLA’s coaching staff tenure last season, the Bruins reached an undefeated Pac-12 record of 8-0-3 that featured All-Pac-12 First-Team members then-junior forward Mia Fishel and then-freshman defender Lilly Reale. The two were among seven Bruins who received Pac-12 honors last season. 
“I am deeply grateful to USC Athletics for bringing me into the Trojan Family,” said Alukonis in a statement. “I have had the pleasure of watching USC soccer over the years and love how the players play the game — fearlessly, aggressively, and with never-ending fight. I can’t wait to be a part of this!” 
While in Westwood, the Bruins never finished lower than second in conference standings, making four straight NCAA postseason appearances between 2018 and 2021. 
Crowned Pac-12 champions after beating the Trojans at home in a 3-1 performance last season, the win eventually propelled UCLA to finish one point over second-place USC. 
Alukonis looks to continue McAlpine’s successful tenure and build on previous season to help the Trojans return to the top of the Pac-12 standings.

When Catherine Chen found out she’d have to isolate after testing positive for the coronavirus, she went into a bit of a panic. After “shoving” enough clothes and toiletries to last her a week in a backpack, Chen rode a scooter from her off-campus apartment to the USC Hotel. 
As part of USC’s efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus since resuming in-person instruction last fall, students like Chen have undergone periods of isolation at the USC Hotel and, more recently, the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. The University is also housing isolating students at a third, undisclosed hotel, according to a student media briefing Wednesday with Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman. 
Chen, a junior majoring in game art and biological sciences, tested positive early in the fall semester through the University’s pop testing program. After receiving an email alerting her of a new message in her MySHR student health portal, Chen knew “something was up with the test.” A couple of hours later, a phone call from Student Health informed her of her positive results and provided instructions for her isolation, which Chen said she was happy to carry out. 
“[Student Health was] like, ‘Do you want to quarantine in the hotel instead of where you are now?’ And I was like, ‘Okay, that’s great.’ Because I didn’t want to risk the people I was living with,” Chen said.
Only students living in on-campus residence halls are required to undergo hotel isolation, Van Orman said in the Wednesday briefing, and all hotel accommodations are paid for by the University. 
Based on the date she began exhibiting symptoms, Student Health instructed Chen to isolate at the hotel for seven days. Under current L.A. County Department of Public Health guidance followed by Student Health, a full isolation period is 10 days where day zero is the onset of symptoms or, for asymptomatic individuals, the date of their positive test. The isolation period may be shortened to end on day six with a negative antigen test.
Once she arrived at the hotel, Chen said the check-in process was entirely “contactless.” She was provided with a passcode to a safe that contained her room key, a food menu and other information necessary for her stay. Chen was also given an allowance of $70 each day to spend on room service and requested drinking water to be brought to her room by calling the front desk. 
Overall, Chen said she was content with her accommodation but did have trouble keeping up with classes. 
“It was really comfortable,” Chen said. “I was lonely because I couldn’t go see anybody and nobody could go see me. Classes were hard because I think professors were not quite prepared to be hybrid at that time.”
Hannah Lane, a junior majoring in computer science, shared similar sentiments about her stay at the USC Hotel after her roommate contracted the coronavirus last February. As Lane lives in a former sorority house off campus and shares common facilities with about 30 other girls, it was recommended by Student Health that she isolate after her exposure to the virus. 
“I had tested negative maybe a day or two before I went,” Lane said. “But I talked to the health center over and over again … There was no condition under which I could leave, even though I definitely tried.”
Over the course of her 10-day stay at the hotel, Lane found ways to entertain herself; She said she watched “a lot” of TV, became “nocturnal” and even dyed her hair. Despite these distractions, Lane said, being isolated impacted her mental health. 
“They did the best they could with it,” Lane said. “The food was good. It’s hard to complain. But just the thing itself really sucked, just being alone for 10 days. By day six, I just kind of felt like I was going crazy.”
When George Danzelaud, a freshman majoring in computer science and business, tested positive for the coronavirus last November, Student Health informed him that the USC Hotel reached full capacity, so he would need to isolate at the DoubleTree by Hilton. In the Jan. 3 briefing, Van Orman said there is “adequate isolation capacity” and an unrevealed “contingency plan” in the case that the hotels fill up.
Once his stay was arranged, Danzelaud said he was required to fill out a contact tracing form and notify Student Health of his symptoms. He took an Uber to the hotel, which is located approximately 15 minutes away from campus. Student Health instructed Danzelaud to take special care when riding by minimizing contact with the driver and car and by double-masking. 
Food delivery at the Hilton varied slightly from the USC Hotel, as Danzelaud was given a $70 credit to use on DoorDash, which he said was “fantastic” and an “amazing feature.” Daily surveys were conducted through MySHR to monitor his symptoms and check on his mental health. 
Danzelaud described the experience as positive and said the stay was a well-timed break from a “fast-paced” first semester at college. 
“I never really felt bored,” Danzelaud said. “I felt like USC was looking out for me, honestly. It could have been a lot worse.”
Students who test positive for the coronavirus are exempt from the University’s pop testing program for 90 days following the date of their positive test.

Close to 50% of USC students have received their booster shots, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media health briefing Wednesday. All students who are eligible to receive a booster — eligibility is five months from completing the Pfizer, Moderna or EUL vaccine series, or two months after completing Johnson & Johnson — are required to be boosted by Jan. 30. 
Individuals have a one-month grace period to get their booster shot once they become eligible. According to an email from Student Health Wednesday, students who are eligible but not boosted are required to test twice weekly or every four days. 
Pharmacies on campus are providing booster shots for all eligible students. There is “plenty of booster availability” at USC right now, as well as in the surrounding community at places such as CVS and Rite Aid, Van Orman said.
As the new semester begins, student rates for influenza vaccinations have reached nearly 90%. 
“We have not seen much influenza at all, even to date, which is wonderful. That’s really the goal of having people influenza-vaccinated,” Van Orman said.
As of Wednesday, there are no plans to further delay the return to in-person classes past Jan. 24, according to Van Orman. For students who are immunocompromised, there is a process through the Office of Student Accessibilities Services to request accommodations.
“We also know that these first couple of weeks, while we’re still having high case numbers, are going to require a lot of flexibility for everybody,” Van Orman said.
Van Orman expects there to be high coronavirus case counts among faculty, staff and students alike, until cases start to drop in the community over the next several months. Though plans in the case that faculty members of students become ill will vary depending on the class and school, Van Orman said the University is prepared to allot flexibility in terms of supporting both staff and students who are out sick and need to isolate.
Over 99% of coronavirus cases in the community have been of the omicron variant. Although the Student Health lab is unable to notify students of the variant they contract, Van Orman said the University isn’t seeing anything but omicron in the “aggregate” reporting.
Studies have shown that the omicron variant affects the upper respiratory tract more than the lower respiratory tract, leading it to be more infectious but cause a somewhat less severe disease.
“Given the number of infections, the percentage of people that have severe disease that are ending up hospitalized or dying from omicron is much lower than it was with some of the other variants,” Van Orman said.
As of right now, no students have been hospitalized, which Van Orman said is “likely partially” due to the fact that over 96% of staff, faculty and students are fully vaccinated. 
Once a student has tested positive for the coronavirus, they are exempted from further surveillance testing for a 90-day period. Van Orman said that this is because of the likelihood that someone will continue testing positive after their quarantine period and the likelihood of repeat infection is low.
Everyone on campus is required to wear a surgical, KN95 or N95 mask. Surgical grade masks will be provided at all entrances for faculty and students who need them, and KN95 and N95 masks will be available upon request through the USC Bookstore. 
Students who test positive while living in campus residence halls are required to quarantine in a hotel, a service provided free of charge. Currently, three hotels provide quarantine spaces for USC students. Students living off campus may also quarantine in one of the hotels to avoid exposure to roommates or neighbors. 
As society transitions over the next few months to the coronavirus being an endemic disease, something that circulates and comes seasonally, the community needs to remain safe, according to Van Orman.
“We need to still be able to have this circulate in our community and people be protected and not overwhelm our healthcare systems though, and that’s the point we’re at right now,” Van Orman said.

Walking around her neighborhood with her summer camp in mind, high school senior Justine Nguyen noticed dim streetlights, which she connected to a more unsafe environment and a higher unhoused population. She then noticed brighter lights and a higher presence of security in a safer area located south of her neighborhood. Observing this, she realized the inequities present in her community. 
This past summer, Nguyen participated in the Health Equity and Media Collaborative’s first health media summer camp. The center, hosted by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, integrates public health and communication and researches improving community health through media. 
Despite renovations hindering them from having a physical space, the Health Equity and Media Collaborative has been able to work toward its goal of being embedded in the community. Robin Stevens, an associate professor of communication, founded the collaborative in 2015 in hopes of simply “[showing] up” and visiting Los Angeles schools and neighborhoods to embed the collaborative in the community. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, she and members of the collaborative came up with the idea of a summer camp to learn about L.A. through the lens of youth and be able to work with students outside of the collaborative.
“The core component of the lab is that we do community engagement research, which means that we don’t do research on the community. We do research with and by the community,” Stevens said. “The whole goal of this summer program was a kickstart, but we’re trying to be a part of communities, not like a one-time in and out. We’re here for the long term.”
During the virtual five-week camp, the participants were divided into two teams for the different projects. One involved conducting neighborhood assessments and social media observations. Additionally, the students were encouraged to go out into their communities and note the effects of gentrification, as well as observe features of different neighborhoods such as the prevalence of parks and drugstores.
Essence Wilson, a doctoral student majoring in communication, helped lead the students through the project. 
“We were just understanding what is the scope of how their neighborhood impacts their mental health overall, and then we also went further and looked into their social media environment,” Wilson said. “What’s your favorite social media? How do they go on it? How do they build a community to help with their mental health?” 
Nguyen’s experience with the collaborative helped her gain insight into social awareness and empathy as her final summer project culminated in a video, where she discussed how gentrification affected her family and how it impacts the mental health of society. Another student interviewed businesses in downtown Los Angeles about the financial effects of gentrification.
“I realized that a lot of people have a lot of different experiences, whether that be good or bad, and you can actually relate to everyone around you. There’s always going to be someone who has had at least some type of experience similar to yours, or at least can empathize with what you’re experiencing and vice versa,” Nguyen said. 
The camp’s other project tasked students with creating media messages about sports and energy drinks targeting teen education. The students learned about communication theory and how to incorporate persuasion into their messages. 
Stevens said the collaborative is currently working with a graphic designer to finalize the health messages created by the high schoolers. The messages will then be presented to a group of youth, who will provide ratings and feedback on the persuasiveness of the graphics. After this process, known as “message testing,” the lab will develop a dissemination plan in which another group of young people will determine which messages are the most effective and persuasive. Students displayed their projects such as videos, in addition to the messages, at the program’s ending showcase.
“I never expected someone to shoot a film with actors, like a 16-year old,” Stevens said. “Then, I was so impressed by another student. Her Instagram intervention about mental health was so above and beyond, and so, we’re continuing to work with at least one, and possibly more, of the students this year to continue doing more research.”
The collaborative is also working on a project, the Twitter Black and Latino Health Project, focused on HIV prevention. Using Twitter, the project aims to identify those at risk for HIV infection, primarily focusing on young Black and Latino men in L.A.
“I’m excited to see how [the lab is] going to grow at USC,” said Juan Carmen, study coordinator for the Twitter Black and Latino Health Project. “If folks are interested in doing a combination of communication and public health and research, it’s specifically for communities that are considered marginalized, [such as] in Black and brown communities. That would be a good space to kind of address some of those issues that folks might not know, or young people might know as well.”
Continuing the idea of being firm in the community, Stevens said the collaborative’s next research projects can be “hard to predict,” as the collaborative works to serve the community’s changing interests. In the future though, Stevens looks forward to the collaborative becoming a welcoming space for students from high school to graduate school to work collaboratively on research topics to improve health.
“We’ll probably spend another year digging in, building more community partners, networking, mapping that and understanding … how we look at young people who are resilient or have creativity and genius to offer,” Stevens said. “I don’t know what it’s gonna look like; I have no idea and I’m completely comfortable with that.”

As I reflect on the state of the United States Men’s National Team in its quest to qualify for the 2022 World Cup, an iconic press conference quote from the late Kobe Bryant after going up 2-0 in the 2009 NBA Finals circulates in my mind: “What’s there to be happy about? Job’s not finished.”
Couldn’t have said it better myself. 
It would be really easy for the U.S. to revel in its 2021 CONCACAF dominance: a 3-0 record against Mexico, a Nations League trophy and a Gold Cup trophy. But that is exactly what could cost this team. 
If the U.S. is notorious for anything, it’s playing to the level of its competition, for better or for worse (most of the time, for worse). The team plays three fixtures in the upcoming international break — home against El Salvador, away against Canada and home against Honduras. 
To put itself in a secure position to qualify, I estimate the USMNT needs at least 6 points from this window. That would see them at 21 points with just three more games to go. Depending on how things shake up with other teams, the U.S. has a chance to all but secure qualification by the end of this international break.
There’s no reason to believe this will be easy — the U.S. got just 5 points from the reverse fixtures of its upcoming three matchups. But there are a few key differences that could favor the U.S. the second time around.
The U.S. is 3-0-1 (W-L-T) at home and 1-1-2 away in the qualifying campaign so far. If you’ve been watching the team, you would know that away games in CONCACAF are some of the most challenging conditions for a team to play in. Away losses are going to happen, but it’s what you do at home that can cement your status at a top team in the Octagon. The team’s two home games this international break are against the bottom two teams in the group. Better yet, El Salvador and Honduras have combined for just 2 points in all of their away games throughout the campaign. It’s a huge opportunity for the U.S. to take advantage of underperforming teams in the States. Dare I say wins should be expected? 
The next difference comes from a singular player. Canada star winger Alphonso Davies won’t be available for the upcoming international break. Davies is not only Canada’s best player, but possibly the best player in CONCACAF period. In 13 games of World Cup Qualifying in his career, he has 5 goals and 8 assists. His assist led to Canada’s goal against the U.S. in the reverse fixture, where Canada stole points from the U.S. with a draw. 
The U.S. is catching a break heading into the game against Canada, as the injured Davies is one less threat to worry about defensively. But again, the USMNT can’t get caught sleeping here — this is still the best team Canada has fielded in decades, as it’s on track to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986. Striker Cyle Larin scored the goal against the U.S. in the reverse fixture, and he also had two huge goals in Canada’s shock win over Mexico Nov. 16. Winger Tajon Buchanan is another attacking threat whose pace and dribbling ability will challenge the U.S. fullbacks. 
A good result in the away game could see the U.S. return to the top of the Octagon, assuming the team takes care of El Salvador Jan. 27. I’m willing to make a bet here: If the USMNT wins away at Canada Jan. 30, it will go on to qualify for the World Cup. The stakes couldn’t be higher. 
Now that we’ve looked at the fixtures, let’s talk about expectations. I’ve been hellbent on this team just making the World Cup in any way possible, no matter how scrappy and no matter the method (automatic or playoff qualification). But allow me to move the goalposts in saying that the U.S. should, at a minimum, finish top three in the Octagon and avoid the fourth place playoff. Why, you ask? Just look at the standings as of now, one thing stands out: the gap between fourth and fifth place is 5 points. That’s a substantial cushion for the top 4 teams to work with. It’s not out of the question, but it’s looking more and more unlikely that one of the top four will drop out. 
The last thing that the U.S. needs is to leave its chances at qualification up to a singular game. Not only would that be a detriment to the mental health of fans everywhere, it’s just a little embarrassing. As one of the top dogs in CONCACAF, it should be an expectation that the U.S. can achieve automatic qualification, not a bonus. 
If you’ve ever read this column before, you would know I’m not a USMNT-positivist. I tend to expect the worst, it makes the disappointment sting less. Let me make it clear that I wouldn’t be shifting my expectations if I didn’t truly think the U.S. was in a good spot. That being said, the next three games could make or break the qualifying campaign. If there was ever a time to tune into the USMNT, it’s now.

USC and its crosstown rivals will finally battle this season in a two-game series, after the earlier matchup was postponed due to coronavirus protocols within UCLA’s program. The Trojans will first travel to Pauley Pavilion Thursday before welcoming the Bruins at Galen Center on Sunday. 
For Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb, she’ll finally get a taste of this long, historic rivalry. 
“I’m really excited,” said Gottlieb in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Not many rivalries is the team across the town, literally. There’s so much history in it and you feel the energy from our players and I’m excited just to roll into it and go to battle with them.”
UCLA leads the all-time series between crosstown rivals 51-50, winning the last three meetings. USC has not defeated the Bruins since a double overtime game in early January 2020, but UCLA has struggled to find its footing this season. 
A coronavirus outbreak in December sidelined the Bruins for almost a month, with six games either canceled or postponed and the original matchup with the Trojans moved to Jan. 20. A coronavirus outbreak also forced USC to cancel a game and reschedule two Pac-12 matchups. 
In its first game back, UCLA lost to Colorado on the road for its fourth loss of the season. In 2021, the Bruins didn’t suffer their fourth loss until early February — exactly a month later than this season. UCLA is on a two-game winning streak going into Thursday’s matchup after sweeping the Washington schools at home. 
Gottlieb highlighted taking care of the basketball against a Bruins side that forced 19 turnovers in each of their last two games. Being the aggressor in the game is also an emphasis for Gottlieb, in terms of crashing for boards and taking advantage of mismatches.
Senior guard Desiree Caldwell mentioned a similar key to a victory. 
“We just have to want it bad. We have to be way grittier than the Bruins,” Caldwell said. “They’re a very tough team that just plays super hard, so we have to match their intensity.”
USC is currently in the middle of the Pac-12 standings with a record of 9-5. The Trojans upset No. 4 Arizona Jan. 9 then proceeded to split its series against the Washington schools. The win over the Wildcats was USC’s first top-five win since 2014. 
Sophomore forward Jordyn Jenkins has caught fire as of late, scoring over 20 points in back-to-back games. 
The 6-foot-2 forward leads the Trojans with 13 points per game and ranks second on the team in rebounds per game with 5.6. Jenkins will likely match up with UCLA standout graduate student forward Iimar’i Thomas, averaging 17 points per game on nearly 60% shooting from the field. 
Thomas transferred from Cincinnati after last season, where she had a 51-point game against East Carolina. Thomas has scored double digits in all but two games this season. 
“She’s a really talented scorer. She puts pressure on you on all parts of the floor,” Gottlieb said. “We’re going to throw some different looks at her. I think our size is going to be effective, throwing a number of bodies at her and making her work on the other end too.”
Complementing Jenkins in the front court is graduate student Jordan Sanders. A strong low post presence, Sanders is averaging nearly 12 points per game but on only 37.5% shooting from the field. Both could overmatch a Bruins team that is heavy in guard play and lacking in forwards. 
UCLA has a strong back court with three guards averaging double digits in points per game, led by junior Charisma Osborne who averages 18. Osborne notched a triple-double in the Bruins meeting with the Trojans in a 42-point rout last season. 
Players are keeping it simple going into the crosstown rivalry. 
“For us, just play our hardest and focus on us,” junior guard Kyra White said. “We can’t control what they do out there, all we can have control over is us.”
USC will play the Bruins Thursday at 6:30 p.m., then return to Galen Center Sunday at 6 p.m.

It’s no secret that the start of 2022 has been rocky (to be generous). Of course, for most movie fanatics, this incites a greater need for escapism, a greater need to slip from our reality into the silver screen. Whether your appetite for superhero films still runs insatiable or you’re in need of some fresh storytelling, rest assured that this year will bring no shortage to movie theaters everywhere. 
“The Batman” (March 4) 
Following a delayed release from June 2021 due to coronavirus, Robert Pattinson finally plays the role of a fledgling Bruce Wayne as he takes on a gaggle of crime in Gotham City, not limited to Colin Farrell as Penguin and Paul Dano as the Riddler in “The Batman.” This upcoming film promises to excite viewers with its explosive chase scenes and terrifying villains. Directed by Matt Reeves, notable for his work on “War for the Planet of the Apes,” the film follows a young Batman, still a novice in his second year of crime fighting, a deviation from the typical portrayals of the character as a veteran hero. 
Also to be expected is the return of sidekick/love interest Catwoman, as portrayed by Zoë Kravitz. For those of you waiting to watch, you will find “The Batman” (and perhaps an accompanying bat signal) in theaters on March 4. 
“Everything Everywhere All at Once” (March 25)
A Chinese immigrant, portrayed by Michelle Yeoh, who initially struggles to finish her taxes, gets wrapped up in an epic, multiverse adventure, leaving her to her own devices (namely other versions of herself) to save the world. 
As seen in its perfectly confusing and action-packed trailer, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” is A24’s latest science fiction film created by the dynamic writer-directors duo, the Daniels; Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, both of whom are notable for their work in “Swiss Army Man.” This film’s cast features stellar talent such as Yeoh (“Tomorrow Never Dies,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” “Crazy Rich Asians”), Ke Huy Quan (“Head of the Class”), and Jenny Slate (“Saturday Night Live,” “Obvious Child,” “Gifted”). 
“Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore” (April 15) 
Muggles rejoice! The third installment of the “Fantastic Beasts” series will hit our screens this spring. Fans can look forward to a gripping adventure that will determine the fate of the Wizarding World. With the ensemble cast of heroes reprising their roles, such as Eddie Redmayne in the role of Newt Scamander, an engrossing battle between good and evil is bound to ensue. 
Succeeding the poor reception of “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald”, as demonstrated with a 36% Rotten Tomatoes score, Scamander is given the hefty task of preventing the rise of dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. David Yates (“Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,” “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” and “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2”), returns to continue his directorial work. Fans of the series can also look forward to seeing familiar faces, such as Eddie Redmayne (“The Theory of Everything,” “Les Misérables”), Dan Fogler (“Balls of Fury,” “Good Luck Chuck”), Alison Sudol (“A Fine Frenzy”), and Katherine Waterson (“Mid90s,” “Inherent Vice”). In addition, Jude Law (“Sherlock Holmes,” “The Grand Budapest Hotel”) reprises his role as a young Albus Dumbledore, to lead a scrappy group of witches and wizards up against Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen who will replace Johnny Depp) and his loyal followers and the beasts they meet along the way. Muggles can look forward to the newest addition to the Wizarding World to hit theaters on April 15. 
“Disappointment Blvd.” (April 22)
Renowned horror director Ari Aster is painfully quiet regarding his upcoming project, “Disappointment Blvd,” the newest, terrifying comedy horror film. Yet, with Aster’s beautifully twisted mind and the film’s stellar cast, with the likes of Joaquin Phoenix and Meryl Streep, the film is sure to do the opposite of its title. 
Aster is notable for his directorial work in “Hereditary” and “Midsommar,” and it appears “Disappointment Blvd” is the latest addition to his menagerie of cinematic terror with A24. The film portrays “an intimate, decades-spanning portrait of one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time,” according to A24. No further plot has been released thus far, but fans can look forward to viewing this “nightmare comedy,” as described by Aster, on April 22. 
“Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” (May 6) 
Have you caught the Marvel bug? The MCU’s fourth phase narrative continues this spring with the next installation of Dr. Strange’s narrative. 
“Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” follows Dr. Strange as he casts a spell that opens up the multiverse. Following the events of “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” dedicated Marvel fans can look forward to the return of Benedict Cumberbatch and the arrival of director Sam Raimi (“Spider-Man” trilogy) to the franchise.

Following a successful in-person fall semester, it felt almost guaranteed that the spring would be the same. But alas, the coronavirus had other plans, and here we are logging back onto Zoom University. Unfortunately, though we are entering the third year of this pandemic, “panoramic,” “pan-Demi Lovato,” — whatever you choose to call it — it doesn’t get any easier. 
While being stuck inside, TikTok continues to be a happy place for many, including myself, and I hope to continue sharing the joy it brings me through what I write in this column. As we continue through these first weeks online together, we can use this time to reflect on what has brought us a community and consistency during these unpredictable years. 
For me, trending TikToks and the algorithm of the “For You” page have served as not only a reminder that we aren’t the only ones going through this but also a joyous escape from the many downsides of the pandemic. 
Take the little dance Caroline Polachek brought from her “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings” music video to TikTok. Yes, the melodic beats and incredible vocals will get stuck in your head or you’ll catch yourself doing Caroline’s dance, but it is much more than that. 
We can all agree with Caroline when she says “I get a little lonely,” especially when we’re stuck in our rooms. Throughout these past two years, we have been feeling a lot of emotions, and loneliness is definitely at the top of that list. 
From stay-at-home orders to quarantines to Zoom University, the lack of human interaction has been the most devastating. After all, we are social beings, but we are also college students who are missing out on some of the most formative years of our lives. 
Besides the heartbreaking sides of the pandemic, there has also been some sunshine. When the world came to halt, we were able to focus on or find the things that made us happy. We were able to look inward and reflect on our mental health and our physical health. We were able to focus on self-love. 
One of my favorite trends to come out on TikTok was the “I Am Woman” challenge. “I Am Woman” is a song by Emmy Meli that is a beautiful amalgamation of affirmations we all should tell ourselves on a daily basis. So often, it is extremely tough to look at ourselves in the mirror and find the right words, so a great alternative is to take a few minutes to listen to this song. 
The videos under this sound on TikTok show the unique ways in which women interpret the lyrics. For instance, the lyrics talk about being unbeatable, powerful, feminine and masculine, and on TikTok, a pregnant woman displays just that by compiling clips of her pregnant belly, the moments after she gives birth and her power squatting.
Even though the process by which it is done seems unconventional, TikTok has provided a rather conventional sense of community during these times. It has brought joy and laughter in the ways that it always had prepandemic, and in the ways most people expect it to — through silly memes, dance trends or videos on the pop culture of the time. 
For instance, I am glad I am not the only one who went through a phase of watching Disney’s “Encanto” multiple times during the last week of winter break. There have been a number of videos showing millennials and Gen Zers thinking the song “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” absolutely slaps. 
And it’s true, Lin-Manuel Miranda put something in that song. I don’t know what his secret sauce is, but it makes the song so catchy and almost impossible to get out of your head. 
Something else that I can’t get out of my head is how much I hate the Duo Two-Factor Authentication system. USC has made me want to skip Zoom classes because it’s so annoying having to use Duo Push to log onto Blackboard. 
My hatred for Duo Push felt like a personal problem but turns out it’s not. Other people on TikTok hate Duo Push too. In one video, a student uses a sound of Michael Scott from “The Office” asking, “Is there no way we can get rid of him?”. In another, a user gives her impression of a two-factor authentication system and honestly, it had me on the floor laughing. 
Here’s her impression (make sure you read it in a British accent):
“Wanted to sign in? Sorry luv, I don’t trust you. Gonna have to come over here first and prove it.”
A lot of TikTok users are college students just trying to get through the absolute chaos that the Omicron variant is causing during this semester. Others are people who are on a journey of self-love.
No matter who you are on the app, there is one thing that is true — there is something for everyone. No matter what you look like, no matter what your hobbies are and no matter what this pandemic has you feeling, there are a billion people on the app who can provide you with the community and consistency that we have all been missing.

On Jan. 4, the Daily Trojan Instagram released the following breaking news alert: “Surgical or N95 masks required for the spring semester.” Soon after, the comment section exploded with complaints such as “I don’t wanna go back on accutane,” “How Totalitarian of you,” “That’s a burdensome requirement” and “I don’t want to go to school with weekly testing, N95, and Trojan check in my last semester.”
These responses from USC’s student body mirror those following other coronavirus protocol announcements, such as the transition to remote instruction for one week and the subsequent extension of remote learning until Jan. 24. The Daily Trojan Instagram coverage of the latter announcement attracted over 200 user comments, ranging from “What about the basketball games?” to “when I am forking up 60k for a private school education, I expect quality. You can go anywhere for online schooling.”
This pattern reveals a sense of entitlement among USC students: the notion that our social lives and personal comfort are more important than the health of our community and the South Central neighborhood we occupy. I find myself frightened by the audacity students have showcased in vocalizing their preferences for convenience over public health and safety.
USC’s new coronavirus protocols appear to have been implemented in response to new surging statistics, such as the average 103,161 new cases this past week reported in the Los Angeles Times as of Sunday, an increase of 71.2% compared to two weeks ago.
With such alarming data available at our fingertips, I’d expect our student body to understand the urgency of recently implemented safety measures. Don’t get me wrong — as a freshman, I  feel robbed of the perfect first-year college experience. I hate wearing masks in class as my glasses fog up, and I am tired of completing Trojan Check questionnaires daily. However, while I am not thrilled about having to take classes online for two weeks, I know these measures are necessary for the greater good.
A case summary on the Los Angeles County Public Health website reveals that, in Exposition Park alone, there have been 11,252 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Sunday. Considering the continuous gentrification effects USC housing developments bring on the South Central community, our student body needs to be mindful of the fact that we are not the only ones here — that we are guests in this neighborhood.
In the fall, I wrote an opinion piece headlined “USC should not suddenly switch synchronous classes to an online format,” in which I argued the exact opposite of where I stand now. What’s changed? For starters, the positivity rate at the time was 0.4% for students and 0.9% for employees. Now, it is a concerning 14.79% for students and 12.48% for employees, with 2,103 new positive cases reported between Jan. 2 through Jan. 8 alone. With the Omicron variant’s lightning-fast transmission speed, the student body needs to be more cautious than ever.
I compel our student body to rethink our antagonistic response to the University’s coronavirus announcements. The situation is not ideal, but this is not a time for individualism.

Famous artists are so precisely manicured, edited by publicists and shrouded in mystique that it’s often easy for us to forget they’re human. Indeed, FKA twigs has been on a supernatural run since releasing her debut album, “LP1,” in 2014.
So when twigs returned last Friday with “CAPRISONGS,” her first new collection since 2019’s “MAGDALENE,” she brought surprises for her listeners: brand new collaborations, heaps of experimentation and an unserious attitude distinct from her past releases.
That’s not to say her music has never been fun — on the contrary, diving into her music is an incredible journey through dense production and eclectic, genre-bending influences. But this release – her first “mixtape” – is obviously less artsy and momentous than it is joyous and human.
In the run-up to this release, many fans expressed anxiety about twigs’ evolution. It’s not uncommon that a beloved artist signs to a major label (Atlantic Records, in this case) and experiences shifts that alienate their original fanbase.
It’s a tale as old as time — or at least as old as cavemen and their instinctive fear of fire. The conception of something new is invariably met with unease, especially from those who cherish the present tripping over each other to grumble about its change.
Yet, as “CAPRISONGS” reveals, the playful 17-track tape is a reflection of twigs’ personal evolution, an aspect of her humanity which she can’t separate from her art.
Evolution, fate and humanity are common themes on the tape, manifested in twigs’ attention to astrology. Multiple tracks, including the entirety of “christi interlude,” discuss twigs’ newfound spiritual peace, as natural as the planets’ movement; “how delightful, you were born on a New Moon,” Christi Meshell says. “That gives you such an optimistic energy / You believe anything can happen, the world is your oyster.”
She elaborated on her evolution in a Twitter thread the night before the tape’s release, saying “those of you who have listened to magdalene know … i have fallen back in love with music, danger, trying new things … caprisongs is my journey back to myself through my amazing collaborators and friends.”
What amazing collaborators and friends, indeed; the mixtape features 9 artists and dozens of producers, most of whom twigs has never worked with before. They each bring something distinct out of her and the futuristic production, from grime rapper Shygirl’s tight verse on the squeaky dancehall track “papi bones” to The Weeknd’s trademark crooning on R&B pop single “tears in the club.” The effect of these features is not just enhanced songs but completely altered soundscapes — the influence guests have on twigs’ approach to a song is immense.
On the topic of inventive genre fusion, it’s impossible to classify this tape to a single genre. Spanning so many sounds, the only constants making this a unified experience are twigs’ flawless vocal control and willingness to play around with futuristic production elements.
There are certainly some chart-ready singles in the tracklist. “jealousy,” featuring Nigerian singer Rema and produced by twigs and Koreless, is a forward-thinking reggaeton track perfect for the new year. It’s been a while since Daniel Caesar’s impressive debut, “Freudian,” but the track “careless” that he’s featured on reinvents the same lowkey, choral R&B which made him so popular in a way that both updates the sound and sparks nostalgia.
The track “darjeeling,” though it may not be a chart-topper, is a fantastic take on U.K. grime. The trio of twigs and fellow English artists Jorja Smith and Unknown T float over the beat as they reflect on their journeys to the London music scene.
The presence of rappers in the tracklist brings out one of my favourite sides of FKA twigs: her rap delivery. She has a short but fantastic verse on the Pa Salieu-assisted track “honda,” but the lyrical dexterity seemingly inspires her to race around on the beat, changing up her cadence and weaving adlibs into a fascinating second half, exuding confidence all the while.
Though she maintains a confidence exclusive to those that have mastered their craft, twigs comes across with levity on every song. It’s certainly less serious than her other work, but the playfulness with which she approaches the tape doesn’t take away from its quality but rather puts the listener in a space to be receptive to the wild experimentation sprinkled throughout.
The highlight in that regard is “which way,” featuring Dystopia, an indescribable combination of spoken word, chanted poetry and squeaky vocal lines over a lowkey trill hop track. As a collaborator with legendary squeaky rapper 645AR, it’s not surprising that twigs would experiment with her upper register, but it is executed to such an artful level that it truly exceeds the fun-loving approach it was inspired by.
Of course, the takeaway from the tape is not that the work is above the playfulness of its production process — just the opposite. It was the willingness to have fun, to experiment with futuristic sounds and new friends, that caused FKA twigs to create this exceptional piece of work. Over the course of the pandemic and her work on this tape, it would seem that not just her music, but her approach to life has evolved.
“Each album i go off and learn a craft,” she said on Twitter. “LP1 to produce and vogue. MAGDALENE to pole dance, wushu. CAPRISONGS i learnt to laugh again and remember who i am.”

A capsule of melatonin a day keeps the late-night hallucinations away. That’s the old wives tale, right? Or maybe that’s part of the inscription underneath the bronze statue of Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., posing victoriously in the courtyard of the School of Cinematic Arts: “Ye shalt not miss a single night’s worth of sleep lest you forget how to operate your own vehicle.”
College students balance a diverse set of responsibilities: class schedules, employment, washing their roommate’s dishes, etc. As a result, many of them are not getting enough sleep. According to the Sleep Foundation, it’s up to 96% of the college student population in the United States.
The effects of sleep deprivation are likely already understood by most USC students — trouble focusing, an inability to manage stress, irrational irritability. A more visceral description is that missing even one night of sleep is equivalent to a blood alcohol content of .10 — well over the legal driving limit. Try knocking out a term paper or conducting a psychological study after three piña coladas and a shot of Fireball — it’s impossible.
Running on little or no sleep day after day, month after month, significantly increases an individual’s risk of developing a mood disorder. According to Harvard Medical School: “In one major study of 10,000 adults, people with insomnia were five times more likely to develop depression … In the same study, people with insomnia were 20 times more likely to develop panic disorder.”
So trading in Z’s for B’s is ineffective and dangerous. Why, then, is it relatively easy — for young people, especially — to push through the night, work, party, what-have-you and only slouch off to bed when the chickadees start chirping?
An elusive, manipulative culprit could be our childhood bedtimes.
Finals week is demanding, yes, and juggling a job, school and significant relationships is difficult, but our willingness to trade in sleep for study groups or last-minute concert tickets is a willingness that does not exist in other areas of self-sufficiency. Food, water and bathroom breaks are, for the most part, prioritized daily. This speaks to our disillusionment with rest.
For many of us, bedtime was a dreaded part of our evening routine. We’d don our pajamas, turn off the TV and trudge off to bed where we’d lay on lumpy pillows for hours on end. Indefatigable, we’d dream up scenarios we hoped to live out the next day until — finally! — our eyelids would surrender and we’d drift off to reluctant, momentary sleep.
Rest was never meant to be so industrialized, so carefully planned out and coordinated. It is as natural as craving sunshine and comradery. It should just be something that we do, undisputed, without recourse or demand for prior arrangement (within reason, of course).
Our internal clocks are almost as unique as our diets. Here’s Harvard again: “What determines our desire to wake with the sun or, conversely, burn the midnight oil, is influenced by the same system that regulates the cycling of many bodily functions … Although our internal clock is set to approximately 24 hours, the exact timing of circadian rhythms varies from one person to the next.”
As a result of these factors, strict “factory hour” bedtimes only discourage children from listening to their own bodies and acting in accordance to their particular needs. The result can be a long-standing feud with sleep itself, making it all the easier to toss it aside in the name of fun extracurricular activities and midnight-deadline rushing.
This year, in the spirit of resolutions, self-growth and actualization, let us give ourselves the gift of rest.
A good place to start healing our relationship with sleep is figuring out just how much we actually need.
Dr. Edward Pace-Schott, an investigator in the Sleep and Anxiety Disorders Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, posits that we can solve that puzzle by observing how much we sleep when we don’t need to be up by a certain time. According to Pace-Schott, “When you’ve been on vacation for two weeks, how are you sleeping during that second week? How long are you sleeping? … [Chances] are you need that amount or close to that amount of sleep.”
Once that number has been sorted out, we can select a new bedtime — one that’s hand-selected and customized to accommodate our current schedule, body and mind. Stick to it. Don’t compromise. And, perhaps most importantly, buy a decent pillow for Pete’s sake; our necks deserve better than the bottom of the Target bargain barrel.
