Shortly after news broke yesterday that former head coach Steve Sarkisian was sent home from practice after reportedly showing up for team meetings intoxicated, USC announced that senior center Max Tuerk will be out for the remainder of the season with a torn ligament in his knee.
Tuerk suffered the injury during Thursday’s 17-12 loss to Washington. Sophomore Toa Lobendahn, who usually starts at left guard and left tackle, took over at center. He will likely make his first start at center on Saturday when the Trojans take on the Irish in South Bend.
Tuerk was a veteran on the offensive line and was one of five captains for USC this season. He has started 38 games for the Trojans and was a preseason first team and  All-American selection.
On the other side of the ball, the Trojans will also be without defensive end Claude Pelon, who is listed as doubtful against Notre Dame with a knee injury. Wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. is listed as questionable with an ankle injury.
In the wake of Sarkisian’s firing, the Trojans have suffered even more losses, this time on the recruiting front. Five-star linebacker Daelin Hayes announced on Twitter Sunday that he would decommit from USC and reopen his recruitment. Shortly after, five-star tight end Isaac Nauta cancelled his scheduled official visit to USC in favor of visiting Alabama.

The Trojans are 3-2 overall and 1-2 in the Pac-12 and will travel to South Bend this weekend to face No. 14 Notre Dame. Daily Trojan columnists Luke Holthouse, Nick Barbarino and Jake Davidson join Daily Trojan sports editor Darian Nourian to discuss their reactions to Sarkisian’s firing and what to expect going forward.
What are your thoughts on Haden waiting a day to fire Sarkisian?
Davidson: Hindsight is 20/20, and while it may seem right now to have fired him after the pep rally, I don’t think that was a serious consideration. He should have been suspended then though and given time off. Overall, I think Pat Haden has a lot to answer for with this hire. If the Los Angeles Times was able to dig up Sark’s obscene spending on alcohol during recruiting trips, why didn’t Haden know about it? And if he did, why would he hire Sark? Counting Enfield as a miss, Haden is now 0 for 2 on revenue sport hires. He ‎has made a lot of mistakes, but not firing Sark in August isn’t one of them.
Barbarino: If Pat Haden was going to fire Sarkisian he should have done so from the start. Actually, Haden should have fired him after his drunken debacle at the Salute to Troy event.
Holthouse: I think immediately placing Sarkisian on indefinite leave was definitely the right move. For the sake of his health, he was not in the right state to coach the team. I’m torn about firing him this quickly though. I think a decision this serious did deserve at least a day for Haden and the Athletics Department to think over. Firing him on the spot would almost be as rash as Haden’s firing of Lane Kiffin at the airport. But I don’t think firing him right now instead of waiting until the end of the season to see if there’s any sort of progress in his rehabilitation makes much sense.
Nourian: I’m glad that Haden finally got it over with.  Yesterday’s decision to place Sarkisian on a leave of absence simply put him and the program in a state of limbo. This way, Sarkisian can move on and get the help he desperately needs and USC can move forward with its second coaching search in three years. This gives Haden and the Athletics Department some time to find the best fit possible for the Trojans because they are on thin ice after the way Sarkisian panned out. I do, however, wish that Haden just fired Sarkisian all at once instead of putting things off with the “leave of absence” pull. The end result was inevitable, but there’s no doubt that the situation as a whole could have been handled better.
How do you think interim coach Clay Helton will do at the helm?
LH: I still think the Trojans have a legitimate chance to rally and win the conference, and the infusion of some adversity might actually help. With that being said, I don’t think Helton will be the rallying force that Oregeron was. Maybe that’s a good thing, because that team Oregeron took over still lost to Notre Dame and UCLA, and it will take more than hype to beat those teams. But Helton’s personality seems to fit much better with his 2013 task of leading the team through one more game rather than his current task of turning a season around.
DN: Saying it’s going to be tough for Helton is an understatement.  Think of the SAT times 10 — that’s how difficult it’s going to be as the Trojans enter, perhaps, their toughest three-week stretch of the season. USC has the talent to win all three of these games against Notre Dame, Utah and Cal, respectively, but Helton’s lack of experience as a game manager troubles me. The one game he served as an interim head coach of in 2013 was against Fresno State and, though USC came out victorious in the end, the game was a blowout from the start so Helton wasn’t truly tested. Each of these games on the horizon have a potential to be close games and two of them are on the road. It’s not going to be easy for Helton to simultanously call the shots on offense and make critical decisions late in the game when necessary. That’s why Sarkisian handed the play calling duties to him in the first place.
NB: Helton has quite the test in front of him as the Trojans will face No. 14 Notre Dame, No. 4 Utah and No. 23 Cal in consecutive weeks. It’s very possible the Trojans go 0-3 in that stretch, but I believe in this teams ability to overcome adversity. I think they finish a respectable 8-4 this season.
JD: I’m not quite sure to be honest. He doesn’t have the raw fire and charisma Eddy O did, but he is a good playcaller and the team responded well in the bowl game under him. I think just like when he ran the offense under Orgeron, it will be a lot more explosive. If Wilcox can dial up some good defensive schemes, USC should be in every game.
Who will USC’s next head coach be and when will Haden hire him?
NB: The Trojans need to make a hire, and they need to make it quick. The Trojans already lost one top recruit because of the Sarkisian debacle. In order to restore stability, the Trojans need to go after a big name. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for Nick Saban.
JD: No idea on who, and I would guess at the end of the season. I would love to see Orgeron come back or, if not, a clean sweep. Kevin Sumlin and Kliff Kingsbury come to mind, but they are both young and USC might want someone with more experience who doesn’t look like he parties. Jon Gruden is a name that gets tossed around a lot, but that doesn’t seem plausible. Whoever it is, he will have to have the talent to win right away.
DN: Without a doubt, this is the biggest mystery now surrounding the program and a head coaching vacancy couldn’t come at a worse time, especially in terms of recruiting. Regardless of who USC hires in the end, it needs to call upon a proven winner in college football, rather than coaches who simply have former ties to the USC program or the Southern California recruiting pipelines. For those of you who want Coach O, I’m certain he won’t be back. He’s a great assistant coach and recruiter, but is 16-27 as a head coach. Honestly, there are not many good head coaching candidates on the market right now, so if USC’s going to get a tier one head football coach, it’s going to have to take them away from their current programs. I don’t even know how desirable the USC coaching job is right now with the way the surrounding media has destroyed its past two head coaches. While I don’t think USC is going to be able to nab a big name like Chip Kelly or Kevin Sumlin, I think it’s likely it hires a coach with a successful track record, regardless of where he’s been.
LH: The hire won’t come until the end of the regular season, so we’ll have plenty of time to speculate. And it will be someone defensive minded, but not Orgeron. I’ll go with Kevin Sumlin now, but I doubt he’ll really leave Texas A&M if they make a serious run at the SEC title this year.
FYI – I’m a Notre Dame fan and this game scares the s=*t out of me.

Come on now, Trojans. I know that we pride ourselves on being the school that everyone loves to hate, and we have more rivalries than you can count on one hand, but when one of our own is struggling, it’s hardly a cause for celebration.
You might not agree with his coaching style, and you certainly have the right to dislike him after Thursday night’s loss to Washington and his 3-2 record this season, but he’s one of us and Steve Sarkisian deserves your respect.
I’ve been seeing a lot of posts on social media celebrating Sark’s temporary dismissal and eventual termination. If Sark had been fired immediately after the Washington game, or if this was the end of the season and Haden announced that Sark wouldn’t be returning, that would be one thing.
But this is something bigger than his job as head coach and bigger than sports. This is about Sarkisian’s well-being and livelihood. This is about his personal struggle. He is the father of three young children who are now dealing with a very public meltdown.
Many reports are claiming that Sarkisian’s drinking is a result of his divorce and continued family problems. Instead of celebrating Sarkisian’s absence, the Trojan Family should wish him well in his time of struggle.
When Yankees pitcher C. C. Sabathia announced earlier this month that he would not join his team in the postseason so that he could seek treatment for this alcohol addiction, people had nothing but respect for him and applauded him for his courage and bravery. While Sabathia’s leave was voluntary and Sarkisian’s was forced, the issue at hand is the same.
Furthermore, the football team isn’t really any better off without Sarkisian than they were with him. It’s not like Pat Haden has gone out and hired a five-star replacement for Sarkisian. Instead, offensive coordinator Clay Helton will take over as head coach and lead a reeling Trojan team to South Bend to face the No. 14 team in the country. And it doesn’t get any easier from there. The Trojans will return home to face No. 4 Utah and then head north to take on a strong Cal team.
Furthermore, all of the confusion and drama that this situation has caused will only serve as a distraction to the team. The players have worked hard to prepare for this season and losing a head coach is nothing but a disappointment, especially for the older players like senior quarterback Cody Kessler who have been through two head coaches and two interim coaches.
The football team is facing an uphill battle after getting off to a 3-2 start overall and 1-2 in the Pac-12, and losing Sarkisian doesn’t make that any easier. Helton has been the interim coach before and is 1-0 in that position, and there is plenty of amazing talent left on the field for the Trojans. We have a capable quarterback with plenty of great offensive weapons and a strong defense. It is up to Helton to take charge of the team and fight on in the face of adversity and finish the season the way the team is capable of.
Meanwhile, it is up to Sarkisian to also be strong during a difficult time and focus on regaining his health. I hope he is able to get the help he needs and have a successful coaching career at another university.
If nothing more, he deserves some privacy and respect in this difficult time.
Regan Estes is a junior majoring in public relations and Spanish. She is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Wild Wild Westes,” runs Tuesdays.
Truck drivers, mailmen, teachers – a plethora of people get fired everyday for their problem with alcohol. Although I do not wish undue ill towards them – I would not say they “deserve” respect for abusing booze. 
We have contaminated the notion of people who deserve respect with wild notions. If you are a single parent working for minimum wage – and through poor planning have three kids – suddenly we are supposed to respect the single parent for their poor planning in their personal and professional choices. if you worked hard since elementary school, worked hard in HS and college, worked hard to get a decent paying job, work hard everyday at work to continue to make good money — AND you feel as a result of your hard work, you are being punished by paying high taxes – suddenly you are NOT deserving of respect by these modern day PC sentiments.
Back to Sarkisian – he had a great gig – high paying, high energy and high profile – he knew what he was getting himself into. If his love for alcohol usurped this – he only has himself to blame.
Differ. Compassion is called for. NO RESPECT for gargantuan drinking he chose in disrespect of his student athletes, his bosses and his fans.
Good point, Regan. The guy did his best and he did give us fans some great moments. This season, of course, has been mostly disappointing, but the poor coach has been mired in worse disappointments. He deserves our thanks for giving his best while he could. Divorce, alcohol abuse, failures, fired, embarrassed – he needs no further misery from criticizing USC fans. That would be disloyal and un-USC, kicking him while he is down. Best of luck to Coach Sarkisian and hopes for a speedy recovery from these terrible events in his life.
Mr. Estes has another pair of the blinders so popular among USC professionals.  Yes, on a personal level, most of us hope for a speedy healing and better outcomes for the Sarkisian family, not just for Steve, to be sure.  However, the main public matter is Coach Sarkisian’s inability to do his job, to maintain self discipline and high standards as demanded by his position and rewarded by over $4 million per year.  Getting drunk and mixing that with pills has been more important to Sarkisian than his job, his colleagues, his student athletes.  This is an ongoing problem supported (enabled) by success at any cost blinder wearing administrators and fellow coaches.  Nothing has been said about the cover ups.  There are many individuals, both at Washington and at USC, and among opponents, too, who observed the abuses and ducked and took cover, perhaps hoping, this too will pass.  Those people have been self serving and have contributed to the damages suffered by student athletes, parents, friends and fans.  Pat Hayden did step up and fire Sarkisian.  The phrase “too little, too late” predicts that others, very probably the trusted and too trusting AD will have to leave his distinguished career with self imposed blemishes.  Sarkisian and his drinking buddies happy drinking has been out of place.  Support for whims a Trojan in the Daily Trojan is out of place and unwarranted.  Take off the blinders and be responsible.  That is a higher value than blind loyalty.  Show some sympathy for the student athletes whose USC experience rattles down the drain of conspired inelegance.  If you wish to help a Sarkisian, do that in private.  For every thing there is a place.
Yes, Steven Means, as a DT staffer from many years ago I was wondering who would step up and re-write Miss Estes’ column. You did it perfectly! (An editor might have tweaked a couple of things, but you told the story.) Thanks!

Child’s play · Attendees participated in hands-on workshops during the conference on Monday at the California Science Center. – Anastasia Velicescu | Daily Trojan
PlayScience kicked off its Sandbox West Conference at the Annenberg Center in the California Science Center on Monday. The conference, which focuses on innovation in child development and play, will continue into Tuesday evening.
Founded in 2008, the Sandbox Summit is organized by PlayScience, a company focused on how play is developed in a world dominated by technology and innovation. Wendy Smolen, one of the original founders of the summit, explained that the development of media and technology has changed the way children play as they develop. Toys are becoming less popular, while electronics have turned into toys and learning devices. This summit provides a platform for discussion about the future of play and the products that are currently on the market.
While Sandbox has hosted events in Boston and New York City, this is the first time a summit has been held on the West Coast. The event was coordinated by Erin Reilly, managing director for the Annenberg Innovation Lab. She had worked at MIT with several of the leaders at PlayScience and knew that they were looking to expand the summit. She suggested that the Innovation Lab and PlayScience should collaborate to bring the conference to Los Angeles.
“The way that we look at play is changing in a lot of ways,” Reilly said. “What [the summit] does is it allows people to get their hands dirty and to experience [play] hands-on, and then to take what they learned back to their communities to apply it with what they are personally doing.”
Reilly said that play is far more important for children than most realize. Play is how children form basic social and mental patterns. The introduction of technology into children’s formative years has had a unique impact on the way children are growing up. It also affects the affordability of the way children are raised, creating a wider gap in the way that children from different socioeconomic backgrounds play. The idea behind the summit is that the way children play — in the “sandbox,” whether that is video games or in their backyard — is instrumental in the way they develop.
“There’s a huge implication in the way that media impacts children, even from a young age,” said Francesca Marie Smith, a research fellow at the Annenberg Innovation Lab who has been instrumental in helping Reilly coordinate the summit. “It’s important to emphasize the way that play, something so basic and yet so critical, can affect our futures.”
The Sandbox Summit spanned Monday and Tuesday and provided a variety of workshops, keynote speakers and networking events. On Monday, attendees could spend time in four different workshops, which ranged from conversations over mobile apps and technology privacy to hands-on sessions experimenting with equipment from the LA Makerspace. Attendees also had the opportunity to participate in a scavenger hunt throughout the California Science Center and a virtual reality tour using the Oculus Rift headset.
On Monday night, the conference hosted a cocktail party hosted by Intel. The event is one of the reasons that Smolen wanted to keep the conference small — it was predicted to sell 125 tickets and greatly exceeded that number. The party allowed students and teachers to see the newest products in child development and play, while also discussing future concepts in toy innovation.
One of the headliner events on Tuesday features Dylan Siegel, a nine-year-old boy who published a book, Chocolate Bar when he was six years old. He wrote the book to raise money to research a cure for GSD Type 1b, a rare liver disease that affected one of his best friends. Three years later, the book has sold over 300,000 copies to raise over $1,000,000 and is credited with accelerating the cure to the disease by decades.
“The beauty in it is that this is a 360-degree learning experience,” Smolen said. “We learn from these kids, and they show us how we can continue to teach them better, and the cycle continues on like that. That’s what it’s all about — continuing to learn from each other so that we can innovate and look forward to the future.”

Artist Nicky Jam took home three awards, shared with Enrique Iglesias, for song “El Perdón.” Photo courtesy of Iñaki Salazar, WIkipedia
The first annual Latin American Music Awards took place in Los Angeles on Oct. 8. The big winners of the night were Enrique Iglesias and Nicky Jam. As a Latino, I absolutely love the fact that Latino artists are being honored for their musical talents. 
The red carpet was star-studded. Lucero Leon, the host, had a shiny LaBourjoisie black dress on with a hood. She looked gorgeous. However, I personally found Gloria Trevi, the Pelo Suelto singer, to be the best dressed of the night. Chiquis Rivera, the daughter of the late pop star Jenni Rivera, was also present and discussed the upcoming movie about her mother. She said to Latina.com, “I’d love to be the one to play the part but I also want to be behind the cameras.” She also wishes that whoever plays the part of her mother Jenni Rivera does it with a lot of passion and love just as Jennifer Lopez did for Selena Quintanilla after her sudden death.
My favorite part of the night was the tribute to salsa icon Celia Cruz with a medley by Aymee Nuviola, who will be portraying the singer in the upcoming Telemundo series Celia about the iconic singer who began her career during the Cuban Revolution. She catapulted to stardom at a time when women had no stage on which to perform. I am overjoyed that a singer who represented the latino culture so well is being honored. Other performances included Daddy Yankee, Paulina Rubio, Lil Jon and Shaggy. 
Gloria Trevi also told Latina.com exactly what I feel about this new awards show: “I think Los Angeles is the second Mexico. It’s the best place they can make this event. I’m so happy because we are going to have a place to show what we can do.” 

I hope this is the beginning of many more years for the Latin AMAs!

This is the complete list of winners.

Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Jennifer Rivera portrayed Selena Quintanilla. Jennifer Lopez portrayed Selena Quintanilla in the 1997 film Selena. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.  
Hey! Great read. I’m pretty happy the Latin AMAs are a thing now too. Definitely trending in the right direction.
One correction though: Jennifer Lopez portrayed Selena Quintanilla, not Jennifer Rivera.

I.C.O.N. Products, in partnership with STOP CANCER, hosted the first annual “Cure Rocks,” a benefit concert on Monday with proceeds going toward funding research grants for breast cancer research at USC’s Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.
I.C.O.N. Products, an international hair care company, held the benefit concert at Whisky-A-Go-Go in West Hollywood. The stars arrived on the red carpet at 7 p.m. and the concert ran from 8:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.
In addition to helping the Norris Center, proceeds also benefit the City of Hope and UCLA’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Centers.
I.C.O.N. Products’ partner, STOP CANCER, has donated $65 million dollars to the three cancer centers and has worked with them for more than 25 years.
Chiara, I.C.O.N. Product’s owner, has personal ties to breast cancer awareness, as a survivor herself. The partnership with STOP CANCER, therefore, began in 2007 with a desire for her and her company to make a change.
“The partnership came about through one of our longtime members in the business world who made them aware of the work STOP CANCER does,” said Bette Bergsman, executive director of STOP CANCER. “I.C.O.N. found we would be a perfect fit because they wanted to get into the business of helping raise money to fund breast cancer research.”
Norris, along with the two other cancer centers, pledged to match every dollar contributed with a dollar of in-kind support to each awardee.
The additional money will help fund researchers’ space, equipment, telephones, lab supplies, administrative services and underlying salary support.
General admission tickets were $25, and VIP passes, which gave concert-goers a meet and greet with performers Lita Ford or All-4-One, cost $50.
Hosted by Courtney Sixx, the concert lineup began with alternative country artist Jourdain LaFleur. American R&B/pop group All-4-One, British-American legendary rock guitarist Lita Ford and electro-indie artist Taylor-Ann Hasselhoff were also among the performers. DJ Jessica Melody finished the show. These artists represent many different genres of music, from electronic dance music to rock.
“The assortment of artists from different genres brings a diverse audience to the event, which, in turn, brings more breast cancer awareness to people from different backgrounds,” said Alex Koops, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering.
Though the artists spanned many types of music, they all used their talent to share how breast cancer has affected their lives, whether it be themselves or their loved ones.
In the press release for the event, Runaway’s former lead guitarist, Lita Ford, explained her very personal ties to cancer.
“I’ve watched my mother and my father both die from cancer,” she said. “So many people suffer every day from some form of this disease somewhere in their family chain. Really, why can’t we find a cure for cancer?”
The attention paid to breast cancer during its awareness month benefits not only breast cancer research but also research for other cancers as well.
“Bringing awareness to what the Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center does in general helps them get more funding to not only cure breast cancer, but other types of cancer, such as prostate cancer,” Koops said.
Bergsman said the money raised in campaigns has  improved research and awareness.
“So many women are diagnosed and suffer from breast cancer,” Bergsman said. “In all these different campaigns, however, not only the money that has gone into research, but also the money that has gone into awareness, particularly in October, has proven to be very successful. Great progress has been made.”

The Political Student Assembly met Monday night to discuss the issue of mass incarceration in the United States in the wake of President Barack Obama’s historic visit to a U.S. prison. The event, “In a Nutshell: Federal Prison System,” was part of a weekly discussion group series hosted by PSA and the Undergraduate Student Government Program Board and touched upon issues such as mandatory minimum sentencing and racial inequality in the inmate population.
In July, Obama became the first sitting president to visit a U.S. prison when he traveled to El Reno, Oklahoma, to speak to inmates convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. According to Kyla Middleton, director of political content for the PSA, the trip sparked ideas for reform that Obama hopes will influence Congress to enact prison reform through legislation.
“Maybe we can start having a conversation about how to fix the system in a way that actually makes [inmates] helpful members of society that are more able to integrate back into day to day life,” Middleton said.
One of the topics brought up during the discussion was the privatization of the prison system, which incentivizes long-term imprisonment. According to Daphne Blakey, a senior majoring in economics, mathematics and sociology, powerful prison lobbies influence legislators to craft stronger sentencing laws, which ultimately keeps people in prison longer.
“I think that a profit motive has no place in the U.S. prison system,” Blakey said. “Companies make the most money when they’re housing as many prisoners as possible, for as little cost as possible — so we’re talking about hyper-incarceration and really poor conditions.”
Other issues discussed included recidivism, or the recurrence of criminal activity in individuals who have gone through the prison system. Middleton and others considered the example of Norway, which focuses on rehabilitation for its prisoners and experiences recidivism rates that are less than half of those in the United States; however, students such as Dominique Brown, a junior majoring in narrative studies, disagreed.
“I like the idea of rehabilitation for nonviolent offenders, but there are bigger things that we should worry about, like decriminalizing a lot of nonviolent offenses and taking away the stigma after they are released,” Brown said. “There are a lot of issues that are going to hold [inmates] back in society even if they got training while they were [in prison].”
Ultimately, event organizers such as PSA assistant director Shawn Ren, a junior majoring in computer engineering and computer science, hope that weekly PSA meetings can provide a forum for discussion and combat political apathy on campus.
“We’re trying to provide a safe space where people … can get together to discuss issues that affect them,” Ren said. “We just want them to get more interested in politics and to learn more about the political issues so they can become better informed citizens, vote more and participate more.”

Art exhibits should make patrons come in with questions and leave feeling like they discovered something. The USC Hillel Art Gallery’s Jerusalem Biennale has successfully done just that. The theme of the exhibit, “7,567 Miles,” is “what it means to be Jewish in L.A. in the 21st century,” according to the press release. Many of the art pieces exhibited, including works of mixed media, photography and paintings, subtly addresses oppression of marginalized groups.
According to USC Hillel’s press release, “7567 Miles” looks to explore “the physical, spiritual, and cultural connections between Los Angeles and Jerusalem.” The objective of the exhibition was to close the 7,567 miles of separation between the Jerusalem and the city, home to the United States’ second largest Jewish population. Rachel Keller, a first-year graduate student pursuing a master’s in curatorial studies and the Hillel Gallery director, said she was proud of the positive response that the artwork was receiving from patrons. According to Keller, USC Hillel is one of three hosts of the biennale. The purpose of the gallery was to create a conversation between L.A. and Jerusalem, as all artists are part of the Jewish Artists Initiative, an organization based in L.A.
When patrons walk into the exhibit, they are first confronted with one of the more fascinating contemporary culture pieces, “Facebook Series.” It’s a three-piece, colorful acrylic on mounted panel painting by Yaron Dotan. Each painting shows a phone-screen view of three different people’s Facebook profiles. Everything about each painting is different, from their varying battery lives, to their schools and their cover photos. Dotan’s “Facebook Series” has received popular reception from the public.
“I’m originally a portrait artist, but I decided to play around with a mixture of pop and contemporary art,” Dotan said. “Each painting tells a story about a person but in a modern way that this generation can easily respond to, just like how a simple painting from 200 years ago can tell a story. There is sense of identity to each painting, which is what I was aiming for.”
Renée Amitai created two oil paintings, “Condor” and “Blue Siriena.” “Blue Siriena” is especially interesting, as it is an abstract butterfly with rich blue color deployed. From far away, the painting resembles a big blue spot, but at a closer glance, there is an obvious outline of the butterfly.
“Inside the gates of my secret garden is my spiritual odyssey, a search for mystical meaning of the forces of nature,” Amitai said in the Hillel press release. “My paintings express my inner vision of the mystery and wonder of the life forces, the plants, the birds, the butterflies, the spiritual connection of all living things on earth, their power and their fragility. While suffering of loss is balanced by a promise of hope, by the flow of joy and pain, the perpetual movement of renewal and the spirituality of life. The transcendence of life.”
Many of the other exhibited artists, especially Erella Teitler, incorporated their Jewish identity into their pieces. Some found it difficult growing up Jewish in America, while others immediately embraced the varying cultures. When explaining her artwork, Teitler made it clear that she used her Israeli, American Jewish and Sephardic identities to inspire her and create a message within her paintings. Her rich blending of history, connecting what happened in the past to predict what would happen in her future and incorporation of the many different cultures that she had experienced throughout her life was fascinating and inspiring.
At this year’s Jerusalem Biennale, artists engaged with the story behind their art. In the case of this exhibit the artists also examined their identities, and looked at that for inspiration and a sense of meaning. Their work is made all the more powerful and enhances the notion of what it is like to not only be Jewish in Los Angeles, but also in the United States.

When I first saw the movie posters for Denis Villeneuve’s Sicario plastered around Los Angeles, I found myself completely disinterested. At the foreground of the poster stands a stern Emily Blunt, arms raised, finger on the trigger of a gun. Behind her, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin are poised, ready for action, moving toward her as if in support of whatever she’s about to do.
I was un-enthralled for two reasons. I didn’t truly believe -—from the perspective of my own gender-biases — that the movie could be centered around Blunt. I also felt the film was bound to just be some testosterone-fueled action movie with little to no heart involved. It had potential to be intense and fast-paced. But could it be interesting and transformative? No way.
But I was wrong. Without giving too much away, I felt it was important to examine Blunt’s character in what is now officially my favorite film of the year.
The topic of female protagonists in naturally male “gritty” environments has been on my mind a lot. This semester I enrolled in the “The Gangster and American Culture” class, and we have studied just how much the woman is relegated to background characters and shut out from the man’s “business.” In the final shot of The Godfather, we see Michael Corleone close the door to his office in his wife’s face, effectively shutting her completely out of his business and determining that the space was no place for a woman. Over the course of Mad Men, the audience watches as females struggle to assert themselves in the male-dominated ad space. In The Sopranos, Tony Soprano keeps his wife in the dark about his sordid and violent life outside their suburban home. Time and time again, it’s clear that women are not allowed in these worlds inhabited entirely of men.
And then, along comes Sicario, where Blunt’s Kate Macer is not only one of three primary characters, but is also the main avenue by which we learn information about the world around us. Kate is a tough FBI agent who’s specially chosen to work with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and Alejandro Gillick (Benicio Del Toro) in a task force fighting the war on drugs. Throughout the film, she continually challenges the seemingly illegal ways in which the task force is handling the job. She questions and demands and prods, and though the men fail to provide straightforward answers, she’s driven by a deeper desire to end the horrifying realities of the drug cartels rather than abandoning the project in favor of morals. Ultimately, she finds herself disheartened with the actions of the task force, but for the majority of the film she continues to seek justice over ethics, and we immerse ourselves the story as she continues.
In a conversation with one of my film school professors last week, we discussed whether Emily Blunt could be seen as a passive character (who has action happen to her) or an active character (who drives the plot). My professor pointed out that if the filmmakers had removed her from the story, the men in the film would’ve pretty much done the same things. By making Macer the lens through which we see the film, we are provided with a sympathetic way of viewing a film that would otherwise be too horrifying and violent for some people to digest. Blunt’s character is a respite for which we can rest our desensitized minds. We question morality along with her, and we’re allowed to see alternate perspectives instead of being bombarded with the manliness and overtly testosterone-fueled story line.
The vital need for Blunt’s character in Sicario becomes especially apparent with Netflix’s recently released new series Narcos — which also centers on the war on drugs. In Narcos, women are once again relegated to background players removed from the business of men. They’re set pieces and play things, not taken seriously or integral to the plot. In light of this, Kate becomes even more important, simply by the fact that she’s there and refuses to give up — no matter how many times the men keep her in the dark.
Of course, that isn’t to say the film isn’t problematic, but it ultimately demonstrates the radical way in which films may reframe and reimagine the stereotypically male spheres that exist in violent action and mobster genres. Perhaps in years to come, we will gain a perspective on how the film plays into the ultimate scheme of things, and Sicario will appear on cinema studies syllabi as a film that contributed to a dialogue in a positive, and perhaps revolutionary, way.

Typically a hub for ostentatious personalities, Hollywood is an unassuming place for exclusive live shows. Even more unusual for the flashy city is a soulful rock band playing in an intimate setting. As the touring guitarist for The Offspring and an enthusiastic member of the rock scene, Todd Morse seamlessly brought this unusual concept to life with his band Toddsplanet, breathing fresh air into what can admittedly turn into a stale club scene.
Toddsplanet reintroduces a style of soul music to the rock music scene that hasn’t been done in a while, which is why people are embracing it with open arms.
“History is cyclical,” Morse said. “The electronic lean-in music right now is going to create a hunger for the opposite.”
Morse’s band originally started out as a passion project. Cozied up to a lively crowd at The Sayers Club for one of their shows, the band chose the perfect setting for a show that needed to maintain high energy while keeping the environment personable. Consisting of a ten-piece band, the group merges a horns section and backup vocalists with the typical rock band elements to bring rock music back to its soul-driven roots.
“Somewhere along the way, the sexuality of rock ’n’ roll connected with the spirituality of gospel,” Morse said. “For me, that’s the most powerful thing, and it’s what makes you want to dance and what uplifts you.”
Trying to preserve that feeling while maintaining their artistic voice, the band specializes in making well-executed, inventive covers of classics as well as performing original songs. As the lead in producing and arranging the songs, Morse crafts material that’s well above the typical cover band quality. His musical influences, such as The Rolling Stones, Bob Marley and Wilson Pickett, and fierce dedication to preserving quality has helped Morse become a seasoned songwriter and skilled at preparing covers that are fresh yet fun and still recognizable.
Opening up with high energy, the band burst into “Beast of Burden” by The Rolling Stones, quickening the tempo of the lines to allow audience members to get lost in the rhythm. Morse leaned into the crowd and teased out lyrics, making the audience a part of his performance. As his passion project, it’s easy to see Morse’s love for his music as he feeds off the energy from the crowd and mingles among his band members.
To keep the audience on their feet, the band breaks into an original feel-good tune “Good Love,” featuring The Voice contestant Maiya Sykes. It felt like good friends jamming out at home just for fun. The band looked happy to be there — they exuded sincere passion for their art. The stage is level with the audience, bringing them even closer to the strong female vocals and infectious melody. With her voice gliding across her dynamic vocal range, Sykes was full-force and in her element.
This show also served as the debut of the band’s new song. What Morse claims as the closest he’s gotten to a Motown song, “Love Gets Loud,” is about unabashedly feeling love and embracing it. Rock ’n’ roll truly thrives off a solid groove and a band that feels every part of their performance, evidenced entirely by the contented faces of the band members. No one was merely performing. Everyone in the band was feeling and experiencing everything along with the audience.
With sights set on providing people with a good time, Toddsplanet is dedicated to keeping rock ‘n’ roll a soulful experience. Bringing a fresh energy to the Hollywood scene, the band merits attention for successfully collaborating within such a large group. The true marksmanship of any band is its ability to keep a crowd engaged and excited; Toddsplanet excelled at keeping the crowds focused on being present with their music circulating the house.

Hey Tiffany, 
I’m 22, and a senior in college. As a guy, I have always wanted a relationship, which doesn’t seem to be what a lot of my friends around me are looking for at this age. I’ve been with a handful of ladies in the past couple years, and just when things seem like they might transition into something more than just “hanging out,” they back away and let me down easy. “I’m just really overwhelmed” and “I don’t think I’m putting in as much as you are into this” are things I’ve heard way too often in the past couple years. It gets harder to hear every time. Most recently, this girl and I even had the “let’s be exclusive” talk, and she even took me home to meet her parents and all that jazz. Then suddenly, she let me know she’d been seeing someone else.
At this point, I’ve hung out with someone new a couple times, but my outlook is different now. Over the past two years I feel like I’m on the outside looking in on the college hook-up culture simply because I value an emotional connection over a sexual one. Not that I refuse to reverse that priority in certain situations, I guess, but it used to take much more effort than it does now. 
I know I want a relationship, but should I just put that on hold and spend my last times in college like the vast majority of those around me, immersed in the hook-up culture? Sure, something might surprise me if I do; I could meet someone awesome who wants what I want. But I know there’d be many more times where I’d be interested beyond hooking up, and then always feel unfulfilled after being with people for short amounts of time and then having to move on. Everyone says hooking up is easy and relationships are difficult, but for me, both are difficult because hooking up is not satisfying for me and so many people aren’t looking for a relationship, which is what I want.
Should I just focus on school and put the whole thing on hold? Keep going with the way I’ve been? Join everyone else on the hookup culture train? What do you think?
There is nothing wrong with valuing quantity of intimate encounters over quality; both bed hoppers and the celibate are entitled to live their lives the way they please. However, don’t try to force something that isn’t you. I sense that you wish you were a casual hook-up kind of guy, but you know you’re not. You will make things more agonizing for yourself by pretending to be. As someone who claims to “value an emotional connection over a sexual one,” getting on the hookup culture train will result in an exhausting cycle of wondering if it’s for real this time, over and over again.
Hooking up is only easy if you’re blindly blundering through with no consideration for your partners. Perfect records of mutually apathetic hookups are anomalies. Moreover, relationships definitely don’t have to be difficult, and good ones are more of a complement to your life than a sacrifice or burden.
As for your history of being let down — introspection is needed. Are you really falling for these people, or rather falling for the idea of them? Are you taking the time to get to know these ladies as friends, and are you honestly allowing them to get to know you? 
Moving forward, I think it would be best to focus on yourself more, and on romance less. If it happens, it happens. Approach new relationships with no expectations, and just take things day by day. Just know you can’t hurry love, you just have to wait. Love don’t come easy — it’s a game of give and take!
Why are guys at USC not looking to date, and why are they such jerks about it?
Even though it can sometimes seem like all guys at USC would rather stab themselves in the eye than date exclusively, a lot of them are trying to be in real relationships — you should meet the one above! Try diversifying the ways in which you’re meeting people, or go after some different fellas. (Hint: Any guy that is a “jerk about it” is probably just a jerk.)

I might be the biggest Kanye West fan out there. I know everyone tries to claim this, but not everyone has two posters of Kanye hanging over his or her bed.
So there, I win.
But at UCLA, some fraternity and sorority members took their admiration of the artist too far by hosting a Kanye West-themed party. As pictures from the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and Alpha Phi sorority party last week show, students who attended, many of them white, showed up in blackface. They had smeared charcoal on their cheeks and foreheads.
Blackface, historically, is the act of wearing dark makeup to depict black people during performances. It is rooted in racism. It was offensive then, and it is offensive now.
As soon as October hits we always hear stories about people who somehow still feel that this form of mockery is OK. In 2013, Julianne Hough, while dressing up as “Crazy Eyes” from Netflix’s Orange Is The New Black for Halloween, threw on a layer of dark-toned makeup to complete the look. Two students last year wore blackface when they dressed up as tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams in South Africa, a country that also has had its fair share of race relation issues.
So despite all the outrage that occurs after these instances, it keeps happening. My Facebook friends best summarized my feelings on this latest craziness: “Lol it’s 2015 lol.”
Thousands of people — literally thousands — have tried to make it absolutely clear that these forms of racial insensitivity have no place on college campuses.
Jerry Kang, vice chancellor of UCLA’s Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, tried to explain  why during a demonstration held by black Bruins last week.
“It’s one thing to suggest you are actually focusing on one celebrity who is African American, it’s another thing to take it as a license to perform every attribute, every stereotype, every grotesque minstrelsy that you see,” Kang said.
Two weeks ago, the Daily Trojan editorial board advocated for a position like Kang’s to be created on our campus.
That position is beneficial, but we need someone from higher up to speak out. That’s where a celebrity like my idol Kanye West comes in.
Those students in the fraternity and sorority houses at UCLA recognized how much of a cultural icon Kanye is — that’s why he was the theme of the party. Social media heightens our sense of personal connection to celebrities. These platforms elevate celebrities’ profiles widening and expanding their platform to advance conversations, particularly those on race.
Pushing entertainers to use their fame for advocacy has long been a debated topic. Yet based on the tone deafness of college students, it seems like celebrities could be vital to prevent these instances from occurring.
Celebrities should absolutely speak up when they are at the center of a racial controversy because their words have the most influence.
You’re probably reading this and thinking, “Uh, well, Kanye does speak out a lot, especially when people don’t ask him.” Right now, however, he’s missing a key moment to talk on an issue that actually needs to be addressed.
He’s not the first artist to miss this vital window of opportunity. A few years ago the public voiced their anger over Jay Z not pulling out of his Barney’s deal when cases of racial discrimination on the part of the department store were revealed. It felt like the perfect time for the music mogul to make a logical — and especially financial — stance on an injustice he has rapped about repeatedly (Think: “99 Problems”).
Yes, it’s a tall order to ask of a celebrity. But if we college students are really serious about having people hear us then we must get celebrities to join our cause. The platform they hold is very profitable. Advertisers follow the money, and if celebrities speak against certain institutions, they are bound to change.
Then that’s where we come in. Students who truly feel offended by blackface (read: hopefully everyone) must continue to support celebrities who choose to speak up. While we hold them accountable to their positions of power, we must push them to do so by encouraging their brands and their mission. Support their statements, and recognize that they might have been made at a cost.
If we fans don’t push celebrities to step up more and offer them positive feedback when they do, nothing will change. The progress toward more racial sensitivity on campus will — as Kanye once rapped — continue to “all fall down.”

@JordynJournals. She’s a senior studying print and digital journalism.
just saying, there is no evidence that anyone actually wore blackface. some were dressed as “gold diggers” with charcoal on their face and pickaxes, and others had fake facial hair, but there was nothing even approaching minstrelsy-level racism.
Having an “Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion” is a ridiculous waste of students’ tuition money. Does anyone really think having a bureaucracy set up to hammer the same political correctness message students are inundated with already will make a difference? The only reason USC would cower and go the way UCLA did is so they can pretend they are taking action on a subject that is so easy to pay lip service to. 
BTW, if a sorority, frat or any other student group decided to have a “Justin Bieber Night” or “Miley Cyrus Night” – I guess universities are saying black, brown or yellow students should NOT participate for fear of offending white students? Or does the double standard hypocrisy still stand and live strongly?

It is clear that globally, and even here on campus, human rights can be forgotten or disrespected. It has been three weeks since a highly publicized incident involving our student body president, and USC has still not responded to the concerns of students. Indeed, the Daily Trojan reported on Oct. 1 that in the three weeks following that occurrence, “Student Affairs has received more reports of bias incidents from students this semester than it did for all of the previous academic year.” It is evident that USC students direly need an open and permanent forum to discuss diversity, social justice, human rights and their significance. However, USC is still weighing options to respond to recent spotlight on students’ experiences of discrimination. In light of that, USC should establish a human rights center.
Founding a human rights center on campus would show that the Trojan Family has respect for the concerns and interests of all students. In doing so, USC will also demonstrate the commitment of the University and its alumni in the growing field of human rights studies. Establishing a human rights center that serves the needs of students is an expedient way to raise interdisciplinary awareness and interest about human rights.
The human rights center’s activities and direction should be student-driven with faculty input, and its focus should be on issues relevant to the student body as a whole. It should also cover individual hot topics as they surface. The student-driven activities should be broad enough to appeal to the interests of students across all majors, not only those from a liberal arts background. It should provide a speaker series that aims to expose students to the field of human rights studies and educate students about basic human rights. It should also provide funding for student internships with international human rights NGOs such as the International Rescue Committee and Anti-Slavery International that would normally be cost-prohibitive. It should ultimately aim to expose students from diverse backgrounds and fields of study to the fundamental field of international human rights and help them understand how human rights will interact with their career of choice.
USC has an international student population that constitutes more than 20 percent of the student body and numbers nearly 10,000 students as of Fall 2014. Many of these students will return home upon graduation as educated and inspirational leaders in their communities. USC should ensure that its international students go home not only with a first-rate education, but also with deep knowledge of and respect for human rights in an ever-globalizing world.
Additionally, USC is in a unique position due to its large international student population: There is opportunity for truly international dialogue about global issues and solutions here on campus. The only thing lacking, it seems, is a venue. A human rights center would provide that. Though it is true that USC hosts several institutes that deal with human rights, including the Shoah Foundation and the Levan Institute, these very targeted organizations do not coordinate as well as they could to address human rights concerns as a whole.
“A human rights center would serve as an umbrella organization for student-led activist groups and University institutes,” said political science professor Alison Renteln. “It would be a natural partner with the USC institutes that deal with genocide and ethics, but it would also encompass LGBTQ issues, food and water rights, the right to self-expression and other critical human rights. In essence, it would create bridges across campus and bring students and faculty together to face and discuss broad issues in the fields of human rights and social justice.”
In this way, a human rights center at USC would not be redundant, but in fact instrumental to ensuring that human rights and social justice issues are being discussed and addressed across all of the schools and various fields of study.
In fact, USC is lagging behind other premier universities when it comes to hosting institutions that advance human rights. The University of California at Berkeley’s College of Letters and Science has a Human Rights Program very similar to the one outlined above. Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government hosts the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, which has an extensive speaker series and funding for fellowships. Stanford’s Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law offers fellowships for NGOs and a speaker series designed to advance awareness of human rights. Even our rival schools, UCLA and Notre Dame, both have centers for human rights, the Sanela Diana Jenkins Human Rights Project and the Center for Civil and Human Rights, respectively.
It is evident that the most prestigious schools USC competes with have made the decision to host human rights centers that are committed to celebrating diversity, creating awareness of human rights and encouraging student involvement. There is good reason for USC to do the same. Having a human rights center makes USC a more attractive option for prospective students who want to become involved in advancing human rights. The issue of workers’ rights on campus, the pressure for a vice president of diversity and the increasing awareness of social justice on campus all underline the growing need for a forum to discuss these and other matters that USC students consider critical to their scholastic, professional and personal lives. If USC establishes a human rights center, then it will be making a decisive step towards making the University of Social Conscience a reality. To do otherwise would be an injustice to the students of USC.

Steve Sarkisian has officially been terminated as USC football’s head coach, Athletic Director Pat Haden announced Monday.
The decision to fire Sarkisian comes just a day after Haden asked him to take an indefinite leave of absence, following his absence at the team’s practice on Sunday.
“After careful consideration of what is in the best interest of the University and our student-athletes, I have made the decision to terminate Steve Sarkisian, effective immediately,” Haden said in a statement.
Haden named offensive coordinator Clay Helton the interim head coach of the Trojans on Sunday after determining that Sarkisian was clearly “not healthy.”
“I want to thank Clay Helton for stepping into the interim head coach role, and I want to add how proud I am of our coaching staff and players and the way they are responding to this difficult situation,” Haden said in the statement. “Through all of this, we remain concerned for Steve and hope that it will give him the opportunity to focus on his personal well-being.
In August, the 41-year-old Sarkisian admitted to mixing an unspecified medication with alcohol and said that he would seek treatment after exhibiting unsuitable behavior at the annual Salute to Troy event. He later apologized, but a number of boosters had already begun to call for his job after he shouted expletives and threw jabs at the team’s opponents, while slurring his words in front of many big donors to the University.
When asked if he had  a drinking problem at the time, Sarkisian said, “I don’t believe so.”
Based on a report released on Monday by the Los Angeles Times, it appears that Sarkisian may have been wrong about his difficulties with alcohol — issues with drinking have followed him from his days as a head coach at Washington.
Sarkisian, who was hired in December 2013, went 12-6 during his short 18-game tenure as head coach of USC — the same record that former coach Lane Kiffin attained through his first 18 games.
In his only full season with the Trojans, Sarkisian led the team to a 9-4 record and a victory over Nebraska in the National University Holiday Bowl.
During his tenure, Sarkisian was also able to put together a pair of nationally renowned recruiting classes.
Expectations for Sarkisian and the Trojans were high entering this season; the team was picked to win the Pac-12 Conference in a preseason media poll.
USC (3-2, 1-2 Pac-12), who was ranked as high as No. 6 in the AP Top 25 poll, fell from the rankings after suffering an embarrassing loss at the hands of an unranked Washington, Sarkisian’s former program, at home last Thursday.
“This one is on me,” Sarkisian said after the game.
Before coming to USC, Sarkisian rebuilt the Huskies’ program over five years as head coach, though, he only eclipsed the seven-win mark once during his tenure.
With pressure at an all-time high, Haden and the Athletics Department begin their second coaching search in three years. Speculation has risen that USC is in the early stages of putting together a target list of head coaches to pursue.
The Trojans, now unranked, will be forced to move on without Sarkisian and faces a tough task ahead, traveling to South Bend, Indiana, to take on No. 14-ranked Notre Dame this Saturday.
With Helton now at the helm, the Trojans will return to practice on Howard Jones Field on Tuesday.
“They still have a lot of things out there that we can obtain,” Helton said. “We have a big game versus Notre Dame this week, the opportunity to still compete for the South championship in the Pac-12, and again, I’m very fortunate to have a group around me as a staff that is as first class as they get.”
As Haden pointed out in his abrupt press conference on Sunday, Helton is undefeated in the head coaching role at USC. He previously coached the Trojans to victory over Fresno State in the Las Vegas Bowl in 2013.
Hi Trojan Fans, I am a Realtor in San Diego and may I say that when I hire an assistant, I use more due diligence than what seems to have been used by hiring a Head Coach. Unless I am missing something the situation with Coach has been well documented. My question is, why was he hired with this baggage ?
To me any kind of blame does not lie with Coach but with the person that hired him in spite of the obvious history and red flags. What say you ?
I guess it depends on how much due diligence one thinks is required…  Haden obviously did the bare minimum and wanted to pacify the fan base with a Pete Carroll-era coach.  Apparently, the Kiffin saga wasn’t a lesson learned.  Now that his own butt is on the line, I am sure he will search high and low and spare no expense by bringing a big time coach to USC.  I wish Sark all the best and hope he comes to grips with his addiction.  
Trojans will always and forever Fight On!

Cymbal is a new app by Anthem Labs that has beenout since May 1 that is changing the way we listen to music.
It allows users to pick songs that they are listening to at the moment and have friends discuss the song by liking and commenting on it.
Put more simply, Cymbal is the Instagram for music. The interface and design are very similar, but the function very different. As you scroll through the home page, you will find songs that users feel are defining their lives. You can listen to the entire song and then determine if it is worth liking or commenting on. These songs are presented in the same way as Instagram, but instead of photos, users see the corresponding album art.
For those of you trying to expand your horizons and discover new music, Cymbal is a must have. Because it allows you to see the tastes and preferences of your friends — and many other users, musicians and bands — you are able to be introduced to music you would have never thought of listening to before.  
In the new trend of social media and music — as found in apps like Spotify and SoundCloud — Cymbal is a nice refresher. It has a more modern interface and style, making it easy to navigate while maintaining its viability.  Cymbal still retains “liking,” “commenting,” and “hashtagging” from other social media apps like Facebook and Instagram, while at the same time being new and unique.
On the bottom of the app interface, there are five different options. One option allows you to add a new song to your profile that is “soundtracking your life right now.” The other four allow you to search for hashtags and people, see your notifications, see your profile — almost exactly the same as on Instagram and see the main feed where you can listen and comment on content that other users have posted.  
Cymbal is an easy and navigable app that fosters the sharing and discovery of music among all. Because of that I give this app a five out of five and, according to iTunes, so do a lot of new users.
