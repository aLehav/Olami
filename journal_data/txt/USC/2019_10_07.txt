“I guess Judd Apatow is one of the funniest people that ever walked through this school,” Dean of the School of Cinematic Arts Elizabeth Daley announced as she introduced this year’s honoree at the Jack Oakie and Victoria Horne Oakie Masters of Comedy Lecture Series.
On Friday, the renowned comedy writer, producer, director and stand-up performer was honored at the Ray Stark Family Theatre in front of an audience of over 100 SCA and SDA students, faculty, alumni and guests. The Jack Oakie and Victoria Horne Oakie Award is presented to an exceptional comedic writer, producer and/or performer by the comedy division of the Cinematic Arts school. Professor David Isaacs, alongside cinematic arts professors Barnet Kellman and Jack Epps Jr., established USC Comedy in 2010.
“[Apatow] has a great eye for who’s funny and what their particular strength is,” Isaacs said. ”We’ve always been hoping to give this award to Judd, because he is not only an alum but perhaps, [at] the top of the comedy writing and directing food chain of films.”
Apatow discussed his early career and chronicled his time at USC beginning in the mid-80s. The writer/director mentioned the cinema studies course “Theatrical Film Symposium,” currently taught by Professor Leonard Maltin. Apatow recalled one of his most memorable moments in the class was when Oliver Stone came to the Norris Cinema Theatre and showed a movie called “Salvador.”
SDA professor, actor, comedy historian and stand-up comic Wayne Federman moderated the event and joined Apatow in comically recalling the early stages of their respective careers. Federman also boasts a number of hilarious speaking roles in Apatow’s films including “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” “Knocked Up” and “Funny People.” 
“Wayne is very much a student of comedy,” Isaacs said. “He’s a nice guy, he’s funny, [and] he’s just the perfect kind of guy to talk to about comedy.” Isaacs elaborated by noting that Apatow and Federman have collaborated extensively before. 
The duo recently collaborated on an HBO documentary titled “The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling,” a tribute to the life of their fellow stand-up comedian and mentor. Federman asked Apatow about his time as a writer and consulting producer for Shandling’s popular ‘90s sitcom, The Larry Sanders Show, which he joined in its second season in 1993. Apatow made his TV directorial debut on the tenth episode of the final season of Shandling’s series. 
Shandling continued to offer his mentorship during the development of Apatow’s later films after their collaboration on the HBO series had ended. 
“[Shandling] would read my scripts and give me advice,” Apatow said. “And his advice was unlike other people’s advice – like when we did ‘The 40-Year-Old Virgin,’ I gave it to him, and he said, ‘You know, Judd, this movie is about the fact that when he has sex, it’s better than all his friends’ sex because he is in love … you have to show that the sex is better for him.’”
In 2017, Apatow performed stand-up comedy for the first time since 1992.  When asked during the Q&A session what inspired him to return to stand-up, Apatow shared a sentiment that is probably all too familiar amongst veteran writers, directors, producers and entertainers working in the film industry. 
“I think I just felt like it’s very easy to be alone in a room for the rest of your life. There’s something about the relationship with the audience … I think you can just get crusty if you don’t stay in the trenches,” Apatow said. “I missed being around the tribe of comedians and I liked, you know, having shakes and hamburgers at two in the morning … it’s just fun. And you know what, a movie, a lot of times it’s not fun – it’s terrifying.”
By the same token, Apatow felt that his recent stand-up performances strengthened his upcoming picture — a currently untitled film that he co-wrote with SNL cast member, comedian and writer Pete Davidson.
As the event came to a close, Professors Kellman and Isaacs took to the stage to introduce David L. Sonne, a trustee of the Jack Oakie and Victoria Horne Oakie Charitable Foundation. 
Sonne presented a series of scholarships whose honorees included USC Comedy founders and additional SCA faculty. The final award, to be received by a student in the 2020-2021 academic year, honored Apatow in the form of a $10,000 scholarship. Sonne not only presented Apatow the Jack Oakie and Victoria Horne Oakie Award, but also handed him a custom-made, silk pajama outfit from Jack Oakie’s dressing room. 
“The nice thing about these is that … you and your whole family will probably be able to fit in these,” Sonne joked. Apatow quickly responded with a punchline, “Oh my god. My wife loves when I wear the pajamas of men from the forties.”

During her freshman year, Aadi Ghildiyal remembers sitting on a kitchen floor in Cale and Irani Residential College watching her friends pass around a STIIIZY, a common THC vape pen, while they all hung out. Each time Ghildiyal was handed the pen, she declined to try it and passed it along to her other friends.
Ghildiyal, now a sophomore majoring in chemistry, said she never wanted to vape and wasn’t surprised when Los Angeles County health officials recently urged residents to stop vaping after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported potential health concerns.  
“I was never really interested in vaping anyway, and I never really understood the people who did it, but it wasn’t really my place to tell them to stop,” Ghildiyal said. 
Marijuana wax pens, Juuls and Suorins have become staples at college parties and social events over the last few years. USC is no exception. Even though students aren’t technically allowed to vape on campus under the no-smoking rule, Connor Fausto, a senior majoring in business administration, says he sees the impact that vaping has on his peers and those around him. 
“It is slightly social because you’re surrounded by it so much, but then there’s a certain point where people use it to deal with stress, and that just has to do with being at a place where you’re expected to succeed,” Fausto said. 
The CDC stated that, as of Oct. 1, more than 1,000 cases of lung illnesses and 18 deaths have occurred in at least 48 states, all likely connected to using e-cigarettes and similar vape products. The majority of cases involve young adult men between the ages of 18 and 35 who use THC delivery vapes. Little else is known about what causes the severe symptoms patients experience, like vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath and persistent coughing. 
The Mayo Clinic published a study Oct. 2 that examined 17 patients’ lung tissues. The report found that toxic chemicals in vape products could be causing damage to patients’ lungs.
Rob Kuznia, an adjunct professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, recently visited downtown L.A.’s “Cannabis District,” where many black-market vape products are made and distributed, and reported what he learned for the Washington Post. 
“One of the most telling or surprising or maybe even alarming things about that area was how much it dominated the block,” Kuznia said. “There was shop after shop after shop, and … a lot of the shops had ‘do not enter’ signs, and they were chained off. You had to be a member to go in.”
Kuznia also mentioned that he saw shops selling empty vape cartridges and counterfeit packaging in bulk. As a result of the ever-increasing number of vape-related illnesses, many states have proposed bills that would ban the sale and distribution of all flavored nicotine vape products. Michigan passed its first piece of legislation, with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer citing a public health emergency as her reasoning behind the sudden change in regulations. 
California politicians have followed suit. L.A. County officials voted Oct. 1 to temporarily ban sales of flavored tobacco products, which is set to take effect at the end of the month. Since then, the vote has been met with protests from many Angelenos who argue that it’s their right to vape despite potential risks. 
CJ Mack, a sophomore majoring in music industry, opposes the bans in favor of those who have turned to vape as a way to quit smoking cigarettes. Juul, a popular e-cigarette brand, markets its product as a cleaner, less foul-smelling alternative to smoking cigarettes. Additionally, their flavored nicotine pods are much more attractive to new smokers than traditional cigarettes. 
“I think that it’ll just turn people back to cigarettes if they don’t have the right support system in place to essentially stop [using] nicotine in general, because I don’t think this is a question of vaping versus not vaping,” Mack said. “I think this is a question of how to get people to stop [using] nicotine.” 
As for Ghildiyal, she doesn’t think the vape hype is going to fizzle out anytime soon, even in light of the incriminating evidence against vape culture. 
“It’s like almost every other person is a part of vape nation or whatever… it’s like Venmo or Lyft or something. Everyone does it,” Ghildiyal said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed three higher education reform bills into law Friday. The bills are part of a six-bill suite introduced in March by Democratic assembly members following the FBI’s investigation into the college admissions scandal, in which students were accepted to USC and other selective universities through bribe money and falsified athletic profiles.
According to a press release from the office of Assemblymember Phil Ting (D-San Francisco), who authored one of the bills, the investigation initiated a conversation about the legal ways those with connections in higher education can influence their children’s college applications and sway their admissions decisions. 
Ting said in the press release that the proposed bills aim to make college admissions fairer by making information about alumni and the effect of donor connections on admissions public.
“We must strive for a level playing field in the college admissions process so there can be equal opportunity for all,” Ting said. The press release also stated that the mandatory disclosure of data will be analyzed alongside state funding such as the CalGrant.
Assembly Bill 697 will require California colleges and universities to disclose preferential treatment given to applicants with personal relationships within the institution. Colleges will be required to release statistics about the number of applicants with a connection to a donor or an alumnus of the institution and the number of those applicants accepted into the institution whose admissions profile would not otherwise be considered eligible for admission.
The law will go into effect in 2020, and colleges and universities will be mandated to release preferential admission data from the 2019-20 academic year by June 30. 
AB 1383 restricts publicly funded universities’ ability to admit students who do not meet the standard conditions of admission — a practice known as “admission by exception.” The law states that each case of admission by exception must be backed by specific rationale.
The law requires three senior campus administrators to approve admissions cases in which applicants do not meet eligibility requirements but show “high potential for success and leadership in an academic or special talent program at the campus” like athletics and fine arts recruitment.  
The bill only applies to schools that receive state funding, meaning only the UC and CSU systems would be bound by the policy. 
AB 136, the third bill in the package, excludes donations made to the Key Worldwide Foundation and the Edge College & Career Network, the organizations accused of running the student-athlete scam, from tax exemption under the Personal Income Tax Law. 
William “Rick” Singer, who coordinated the scheme, used the Key Foundation and the Edge College & Career Network as cover-ups for the large sums of money used to bribe athletics staff and university officials to falsely designate applicants as athletic recruits.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University said it is reviewing the new laws. USC did not comment further.

The Department of Public Safety issued a crime alert to the University community Sunday following multiple reports of sexual battery incidents to inform the campus of important safety precautions and to ask students to come forward with any information about the reported incidents. 
The alert detailed three similar incidents of sexual fondling that occurred from Sept. 30 to Oct. 4 at different locations in the area surrounding campus. DPS believes the incidents are related. 
In each incident, a student described a suspect in a hoodie on a bike approached victims from behind and slapped their buttocks.
DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said the nature of the harrassment and the similarity of method result in DPS potentially looking for one perpetrator. 
The first incident took place on campus on Sept. 30 when the victim, a USC student leaving campus on Figueroa Street, was approached by the suspect on a bike and “felt a hard slap to her buttocks.”
A similar incident took place near the Shrine Auditorium Oct. 1 when another USC student walking alone was similarly approached and harrassed. 
The third incident took place on campus Oct. 4 when a USC student returning from an event was walking toward the Royal Street Structure “when a male riding a bicycle behind her grabbed her buttocks.”
Carlisle said DPS is currently investigating the incidents and searching for a suspect.
“These types of conflicts occur periodically,” Carlisle said. “Typically [they involve] different suspects, but when they happen in succession like this, we suspect it may be the same person.”
Two of the victims described a Hispanic male in his 20s with black shoulder-length hair riding a dark-colored bicycle. The crime alert also noted that “race, ethnicity, gender, and/or religious affiliations are not considered the basis for suspicion; only behaviors are considered suspicious.”
Carlisle suggested that students should always remain aware of their surroundings and travel in well-lit areas in groups after dark. He also advised students to take advantage of the various transportation services provided by the University, such as the free Lyft service and Campus Cruiser. 
“We would hope that [victims] would report immediately and any witnesses would come forward … so we can look for additional evidence such as a better description,” Carlisle said. “If the person calls right away on our emergency number, perhaps we can catch the person at the time the incident occurs.”
DPS said the investigation is ongoing and has been forwarded to the Los Angeles Police Department. Officials are currently going through surveillance cameras to see if there is any footage they could use to identify the suspect.

USC’s women’s volleyball squad split its two Pac-12 matches this weekend at Galen Center, defeating No. 8 Washington 3-1 Friday before falling to No. 24 Washington State 3-2 Sunday afternoon.
The Trojans were able to hand Washington its second conference defeat of the year. The Huskies came into the match at 10-2, so it felt like a must-win for a USC team that had been slipping down the polls this season.
USC came out strong in the first set, killing the ball 17 times in the frame, and was lifted by a key performance from junior outside hitter Brooke Botkin, who recorded a season-high 19 kills in the match, including six in the first set.
Senior libero Raegan LeGrand, who made her first collegiate start against Washington in 2018, was also dominant during the match after getting the nod at the libero position earlier in the week.
“Raegan LeGrand was fantastic at libero,” head coach Brent Crouch said. “She was just really, really good; it was exciting to see her perform.”
Although the defense has been inconsistent for the Trojans this year, USC was able to hold Washington to hitting just .100 for the whole match Friday en route to the win. Crouch said the team’s defense was its best attribute on the night.
“We were touching a lot of stuff and scrapping on the ground and digging,” Crouch said. “You hold a team to .100, you have a good chance to win.”
Washington’s 30 errors committed throughout the match proved to be costly for them but beneficial for the Trojans. With the third set tied at 19, USC went on a 6-0 run that included two attacking errors by the Huskies. 
The fourth set started rocky for the Trojans, who opened up with four errors to dig themselves in a 2-7 hole, but a timeout from Crouch helped spark a 6-3 run. In a similar situation last week against Arizona, USC came out of a timeout in the third set and rallied to secure a 3-1 victory. 
After battling back into striking position, Botkin put the match away, winning the last 2 points for USC.
The loss to Washington State was the first home contest of the season for the Trojans. USC climbed out of a 2-0 deficit to take the match to five sets but came up a few points short of the comeback. 
Despite the loss, LeGrand shined yet again for a USC team that still seems to be looking for a replacement for former libero Victoria Garrick. LeGrand had 25 digs on the day while committing no defensive errors.
Statistically,  the match against the Cougars was very even. USC hit .241 while the Cougars hit .249, and both teams had six aces each. Senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier’s performance was especially noteworthy, as the senior had season highs of 25.5 points, 23 kills and 59 attacks.
USC will have another chance to face the Cougars Nov. 3. but will head to the Rocky Mountains to play against Colorado as the Trojans start a four-game road trip. They return to Galen Center Oct. 25 to take on Cal.

Kirk Franklin and God’s Property’s “Stomp,” and Kanye’s “Ultralight Beam” are two sides of the same coin. Elements of Black American gospel music have long been used outside of the church’s four walls and have infiltrated into mainstream pop culture. 
Kanye’s “Jesus Walks,” a song about grappling faith with fame, might be the first instance that comes to mind for many. But before the 2004 hit graced our ears, the genre had several breakout pop culture moments.
In 1968, The Edwin Hawkins Singers’ rendition of “Oh Happy Day” hit No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Most notably, at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, Puff Daddy & The Family, along with then-widow Faith Evans and band 112, performed a tribute to the late Notorious B.I.G with “I’ll Be Missing You” featuring a gospel choir. And at the 2014 Grammy Awards, 33 couples wed to Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ “Same Love,” as a gospel choir belted in the background. 
Black gospel music is symbolic of the Christian, African American subculture. Originating in the tradition of Negro spirituals, the mere use of a choir has been used to evoke meaning broader than religion. It’s about unity, hope and overcoming struggle. 
While black gospel musical traditions are used fervently to honor the fallen or to celebrate progressiveness, they’ve also been pimped by artists and institutions in lieu of real empathy or support of the very community the music originated in. 
On the night of Oct. 1 live from Instagram in Paris, Kerby Jean-Raymond, designer and founder of the menswear label Pyer Moss called out the fashion publication, Business of Fashion for their exploitation or Black culture and plight for insincere gain. 
A Black gospel choir welcomed guests to the BoF 500 Gala in Paris Monday night, an annual event to celebrate those shaping the global fashion industry. And to the use of the choir, Jean-Raymond wrote: “This is some insulting shit.” 
Throughout the night via Instagram and later in a Medium post, Jean-Raymond explained the source of his frustration citing instances where Black designers have been lumped together on panels, getting offered the publication’s print cover then having that offer rescinded and other cases of disrespect to Black designers by the magazine’s founder, Imran Amed. Amed also took to the stage to dance with the choir in what Jean-Raymond called a “Kirk Franklin dance.” 
The Haitian designer himself has used Black gospel choirs throughout his runway career — including one that represented the untold stories of Black people’s contributions to American history and culture.
A fellow designer and friend of Jean-Raymond’s Aurora James also commented on her Instagram story.
“Not everyone gets to have a Black gospel choir,” she wrote. “I’m so confused. Aren’t we supposed to be celebrating diversity? And inclusion? Not appropriation? We are at a fashion awards show. Fashion exploits more women of color than any other industry. Why is there a Black gospel choir?”
Her inquiry is valid, and so is Jean-Raymond’s frustration. The choir was just the straw that broke the camel’s back in a long series of shady and disingenuous diversity efforts from BoF. It is disheartening for an organization that can’t get diversity right institutionally to use Black cultural elements as a celebration. In short, BoF couldn’t practice what they aesthetically preached. 
Diversity and inclusion is real work, not a trend. Although it’s been done many times, publications and institutions cannot mask efforts to break down institutional racism with ostentatious celebrations of Blackness or diversity. If, brewing under the surface, designers like Jean-Raymond feel overlooked and undervalued, no gala or performance matters. 
Unlike Diddy’s celebration of his late friend and label mate or Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ use of the choir to mark strides in LGBTQ rights, the drama surrounding BoF and their use of a Black choir is a classic case of cultural appropriation.
When thinking of other ways in which Black gospel choirs have been used problematically, I circle back to Kanye West. In 2019, we’ve experienced Kanye West as a revivalist. He’s likely coming for Franklin’s spot. His Sunday Service events feature a gospel-esque choir flipping hip-hop and R&B into praise in worship. 
On Oct. 5, at West’s free-to-attend Sunday Service in Salt Lake City, he showcased just how deceiving the use of the gospel choir can be. Kanye’s Sunday Service had up to this point been focused on spirituality and a commitment to Jesus, but this week he took the stage to tell fans that it was the Republican Party of Lincoln that freed the slaves. He also mentioned the flak he’s received for his support of President Donald Trump as a Black man. 
“I ain’t never made a decision only based on my color. That’s a form of slavery, mental slavery,” Kanye said, doubling down on his 2018 comment about slavery being a choice. 
In the same way BoF used a Black gospel choir in an unscrupulous way, Kanye has as well. 
Yes, the Chicago native has a long history of using Black gospel music. And who is to say he hasn’t actually reconnected with his faith and is ready to share it with the world? But it is in poor taste to not only spew false facts about slavery while using the choir as background music but to also publically support a political figure who has proven to not care about the people or culture that this music originates from. It is ironic that the same man who uttered that slavery was a choice is now using the stylings and aesthetics of Black gospel music, a tradition rooted in slavery. 
What Kanye and BoF show us is that Black culture and what it can do aesthetically continues to trump the actual support of Black people. 
Politically, America has a racist president and there are countless ways in which Black people are systematically oppressed. And in the fashion industry, it’s no question that there is a shortage of Black models, designers and creative directors, on top of the usual instances of cultural appropriation and culturally insensitive clothing. Instead of focusing on fixing these issues, both parties have chosen to pimp a symbol of joy, hope and resilience. 
There’s no doubt that there’s power in music, especially in gospel and gospel choirs. Negro spirituals served as the unofficial soundtrack to the Civil Rights movement; artists have long used elements of religion to tell stories and connect people to causes greater than themselves. 
Despite this long withstanding occurrence, we must not always take the use of religion in nonreligious contexts as working in good faith. The word of God, a cute Bible verse or the call and response of a choir is always awe-inspiring in theory, but they mean virtually nothing if the people or parties using — or better yet, weaponizing — it can’t practice what they preach.

Student-run sketch comedy group Fourth Quarter All-Stars had audiences laughing throughout the entirety of its show “16 in the Middle of Miami” at the USC Brain and Creativity Institute Thursday night.
The hour-long show featured a host of witty sketches that showcased the group’s masterful comedy-writing skills and ability to craft relatable content for its college student demographic. Spanning various mediums, a combination of performed scenes, film bits, rap songs and a knockout musical finale kept the show fresh and fast-paced. 
The show opened with a stellar impression of President Carol Folt by Vivian Gray, a sophomore majoring in film and television production, where Folt suggests an alternative spanking punishment for the guilty parties involved in the numerous scandals surrounding the University. The momentum continued with a substitute Professor Snape sketch where the students observe that he has a “bisexual bob,” leading to suspicions that he is an actor. There are recurring motifs and characters throughout the show that appear when you least expect them, surprising audiences in an already unpredictable show. The Hannah Montana theme song interludes bring characters together, helping them build an enduring relationship, and the reappearance of mobster Domino’s delivery boy Guiseppe blindsided audiences and made for one of the most comedic moments of the show.
But it was the short musical performances that stole the show. A rap number where musical artist “Onset” raps about his early-onset Alzheimer’s has snappy lyrics and an energetic beat. The ending musical number captivated the audience with a tune so catchy that they all left singing it.
The audience’s reaction was overwhelmingly positive. There were a few scattered laughs at every joke and a unified uproar during the punchlines or any particularly edgy moment.  
“There is definitely a lot going on, very action-packed within an hour, but most of the jokes remained fresh and [the show] flowed pretty well,” said audience member Charlie McCollum, a freshman majoring in film and television production.
Cooper Roth, a freshman majoring in film and television production and one of the group’s newest recruits directed the SNL-esque film sketch “The Search for Cupertino.” The script was written by fellow group member Samantha Lee, a sophomore majoring in history and writing for screen and television, who also starred in the short film.
“We knew that we only had one day to do it, and so they were very kind because they had never actually seen a piece of my directing before, and yet they all agreed that I should be directing the film,” Roth said. “It was a total blast because, for me, I’m this freshman. I was hoping that I would be able to make a film at some point in my freshman year in film school and all of a sudden I was directing a film in my first month with a bunch of people that were already some of my closest friends.”
4QAS never missed an opportunity for a comedic moment. The show concluded with a Non-Disclosure Agreement being thrown out into the audience, prohibiting attendees from being “a little snitch,” which left audience members in fits of laughter as they headed back into the real world.

Another NFL Sunday is in the books! The strengths and weaknesses of teams are becoming clearer, but there were still plenty of surprises this week. I’ll be breaking down Week 5’s biggest winners and losers and what to expect from them going forward. 
Winners:
Indianapolis Colts
Following an embarrassing loss to the Raiders, the Colts entered Arrowhead Stadium as 11-point underdogs. They put the league on notice by shutting down the Kansas City Chiefs’ high-powered offense in a 19-13 upset victory. Although the Chiefs are missing their best receiver Tyreek Hill, this is still an impressive feat for a Colts defense that came into the game as a middle-of-the-pack unit in both points and yards allowed. After all, the Chiefs had been averaging nearly 34 points per game despite losing Hill Week 1.
Going forward, the Colts will need to prove that this week was no fluke to establish themselves in what is currently a muddy AFC playoff picture. Head coach Frank Reich and general manager Chris Ballard have done a stellar job maintaining a competitive roster after Andrew Luck’s shocking retirement this preseason. The Chiefs need to hope that other defenses are not able to replicate the Colts’ performance in the coming weeks; they’ll bounce back, and Hill’s return will reignite the offense. 
Kirk Cousins
The Vikings’ quarterback took a step toward silencing his doubters with his performance in their 28-10 win over the Giants. Cousins’ teammate wide receiver Adam Thielen publicly criticized Cousins and the Vikings’ passing game as a whole after the offense put up just 6 points against the Bears last week. Against the Giants, Cousins threw for over 300 yards, and Thielen led the Vikings with 130 receiving yards and two touchdowns.
However, I would be surprised if this is the last we hear of this drama. The Giants defense is far from formidable, and I expect the Vikings will have more trouble throwing the ball in the coming weeks than they did Sunday. Additionally, defensive-minded head coach Mike Zimmer and offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski are both inclined toward a run-heavy offense. The Vikings host the Eagles Sunday, who possess a strong run defense and a questionable pass defense, so the Vikings offensive philosophy will be put to the test again soon. Cousins has to prove that he was worth the mammoth contract he signed last offseason, as the Vikings’ hopes for the season rest on his arm.
Kyler Murray and Kliff Kingsbury (sort of)
The Arizona Cardinals got their first win of the season Sunday over the Cincinnati Bengals, which means that Murray and Kingsbury earned their first win as an NFL quarterback and coach, respectively. Murray posted an impressive 77.8 quarterback rating and led the team in rushing with 93 yards and a touchdown. However, it’s unclear whether this win bodes well for the Cardinals’ long-term future. The Bengals dropped to an 0-5 record, significantly boosting their chances of securing a better draft pick than the Cardinals in April’s draft. Arizona’s roster is riddled with injuries and the team is already out of contention in the NFC, so Sunday’s win was a moral victory at the expense of building the team’s roster for next season. Additionally, the Cardinals’ tie with Detroit Week 1 means that all the currently winless teams — the Jets, Bengals, Redskins and Dolphins — have to win two more games than Arizona for the Cardinals to have a chance at a better pick than them. We’ll look back at this game come draft season, and the Cardinals can only hope it doesn’t cost them a top prospect.
Losers:
Titans’ field goal unit
The Titans missed not one, not two, not three but four field goal attempts in their 14-7 loss to the Buffalo Bills Sunday. The league average field goal percentage is currently 89.2%, which means if they had even managed to be league-average on their four attempts yesterday, they would have won the game. It’s rare to see a 53-yard miss, a 33-yard attempt blocked, a 36-yard miss and a 50-yard miss by a single team. This was only the third time since 2000 that a team has attempted at least four field goals and not made a single one, according to Pro Football Reference.
The Titans released Santos Monday following the embarrassing showing. The loss to the Bills will certainly be a tough one for the team to shake off, and it hurts Tennessee’s playoff chances significantly. The Bills have to feel lucky to come away with this win, as they continue to have the clearest path to a wild card in the AFC. 
Los Angeles Chargers
The Chargers laid an egg on Sunday, losing to the previously winless Broncos 20-13. The defense gave up 17 points in the first quarter, and the Chargers were never able to recover. Running back Melvin Gordon’s return from his holdout did not help the offense’s efficiency, and wide receiver Keenan Allen — who previously led the league in receptions — was unable to get going. This loss puts the Chargers in panic mode. They entered the season with playoff hopes, but they need better production from just about every position group on the roster if they are going to turn things around.
These will all be factors to watch going forward, although each week will bring a new set of surprises. I hope you’re as excited as I am for the rest of the season.

No. 2 USC women’s soccer has returned to its winning ways after a successful weekend in Arizona, where it defeated Arizona State 2-1 and Arizona 1-0. The Trojans improved to 9-1-1 overall and 2-1-0 in Pac-12 play. 
USC’s first game against ASU Thursday was a thriller that went down to the final whistle.
The Trojans took a 1-0 lead in the seventh minute as freshman midfielder Jaelyn Eisenhart’s corner kick bounced off an ASU defender and into the net. It was the first own goal in favor of USC this season.
The Trojans held the lead until the 62nd minute, when ASU sophomore midfielder Marleen Schimmer found the back of the net on a right-footed strike. Schimmer was a player that the Trojans looked to contain, but the talented midfielder was able to score despite the defensive attention.
ASU continued to cause problems for the Trojans throughout the second half, making it difficult for USC to find chances offensively. USC head coach Keidane McAlpine said the Sun Devils did not get discouraged after falling behind early.
“They were very disciplined in their tactics,” McAlpine told USC Athletics. “Even when we got that early goal, they stayed with it and found a way to get that goal.” 
As the clock wound down, it seemed the match was destined for overtime. Early in the 90th minute, however, a cross from redshirt senior midfielder Natalie Jacobs found the head of redshirt freshman defender Kaylin Martin, and the Trojans took a 2-1 lead with 38 seconds to play. It was Martin’s first goal of the season, and she became the eighth Trojan to score in 2019.
USC could not claim its victory yet, though, as ASU earned a penalty kick with a mere 21 seconds to play. Sophomore forward Nicole Douglas stepped up for the Sun Devils and fired a shot toward the right side of the goal, but sophomore goalie Anna Smith came up with the game-winning save, and the Trojans escaped Tempe with a 2-1 victory.
McAlpine was pleased with the result of the game but knew his squad could improve in a few areas before facing Arizona Sunday. 
“Huge win on the road — we’ve got some things to fix, but we’ll take it and we’ll move forward,” McAlpine said.
The Trojans had to battle not only the Wildcats but also the heat Sunday afternoon, as the thermometer read 90 degrees at kickoff.
Martin’s first goal against Arizona State Thursday was not her only first of the weekend. In the 38th minute, she picked up her first assist on a through ball to junior forward Tara McKeown. McKeown leads the Trojans with 9 goals on the season.
This time, the opening goal would be all USC needed as its defense buckled down and secured its third shutout of the season. It was also the first time Arizona has been held scoreless at home so far this season.
McAlpine said he was proud of the effort his team put forth despite the heat.
“This was a fantastic win for us,” McAlpine said. “Very difficult conditions, a great team across from us that knows how to compete [and] how to fight. We were able to defend really well and fight through when we needed to.” 
USC is now above .500 in Pac-12 play with a record of 2-1. The Trojans will have a few days off before facing Utah 3 p.m. Thursday at McAlister Field.

As of last week, it is year 5780 in the Jewish calendar. Jews around the world are celebrating the first month of the Jewish calendar, filled with happiness and holiday celebrations. This is no different for the Jews at USC. While the University hasn’t always been the most welcoming of places for Jewish students, times are drastically different today. There is a vibrant Jewish community that flourishes through various campus organizations, religious groups and even academic departments. But the University still lacks a key aspect of providing for its Jewish students: meeting religious dietary restrictions. 
Yes, the University has made great strides and has looked into the issue several times before. In the early 2000s, USC invited kosher food trucks, which eventually left because their profits weren’t as high as they could be if they operated in more heavily concentrated Jewish areas. As of 2018, the University caters three kosher meals a week in USC Village dining hall. However, there are only certain hours they can be picked up, it only exists three evenings a week and it certainly isn’t the same quality food as the non-kosher meals provided by the University. These attempts at providing for religious students make it clear that the University must put students over profit and invest in a permanent, on-campus kosher food option. 
Dean Varun Soni and Rev. Jim Burklo of the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life see an on-campus food option as the best solution, and they have been pushing for kosher and halal options for some time. 
“What our goal has always been is to, at some point, develop a full-time resource where we have a kosher and halal station in one of the dining halls so that anyone on a meal plan — Jewish, Muslim or otherwise — [can swipe in and eat],” Sonni said. “If the food is tasty enough, it doesn’t matter, people will eat it.” 
Soni listed the Good Karma Cafe as an example of how a kosher and halal option could work. The cafe, which recently reopened in St. Mark’s Lutheran Church, complies with the needs of Hindu students, but also attracts non-Hindu students because of the food’s quality. 
There is no doubt that a kosher dining hall section would require more investment than a vegetarian option; there are many factors at play when converting a section of a dining hall to accommodate the laws of kashrut. For this to work, the dining hall would need to have a separate kosher kitchen, kosher utensils and a trained rabbi who oversees the daily operations of the facility. It’s no easy feat. 
But if we boil it down to the main issue, we find that any reluctance comes down to only one obstacle: cost. It would be a shame if, of all things, unwillingness to spend is what prevents one of the wealthiest universities in the world from becoming a more welcoming environment. 
Soni notes that pushback against building a kosher dining hall section stems from the argument that the current number of observant Jews on the kosher meal plan — currently in the single figures, according to Sonni — does not justify the cost. However, he supports the initiative because of what he describes as a “chicken and an egg problem.”
“Everytime we run a kosher or halal program we don’t have enough students to justify the expense of a full-time resource,” Sonni said. “But without that full-time resource, we won’t get enough students to enroll here to sort of get us there.” 
He said he believes implementing a kosher section of the dining hall will cause more students, regardless of their background, to discover and enjoy Jewish food traditions. 
Even if the University is unwilling to build an entirely new kitchen, there is a simpler solution it should consider in the meantime. Chabad Jewish Student Center at USC — a Jewish organization that hosts religious services, social events and meals during the Jewish Sabbath and holidays — is in the process of renovating its space. In a few months, the Chabad House will have a new kitchen that will comply with the needs of observant Jewish and Muslim students. At the very least, the University should allow students to use their meal swipes and dining dollars at the Chabad kitchen after it is fully constructed. 
Chabad Rabbi Dov Wagner said he has spoken with USC Hospitality about the construction plans and said he is willing to make any accommodations to satisfy University requirements. He said he is waiting on USC Hospitality to fully inspect and approve the kitchen plans. Representatives from USC Hospitality did not comment in time for publication. 
President Carol Folt was clear in her inauguration speech that her tenure as the University’s leader would emphasize listening to students and putting their needs first, even if it means spending a little extra. Endorsing a kosher and halal dining hall section — or at least allowing University meal swipes to be used in the new Chabad kitchen — would show she really means it.

For many students, the transition from freshman to sophomore year marks a milestone that brings more responsibility and opportunities for “adulting.” One of the first major changes most students encounter is the upgrade from dorm- or suite-style living to apartments. Whether it’s in USC Village or Cardinal Gardens, most apartment plans have one thing in common: a kitchen. 
Although some students might not want to cook for themselves and are happy to continue eating at the dining hall, this sentiment may not be the same for all students in USC Housing apartments. Whatever their preference, students should have the freedom to cook completely on their own. USC should make it optional for students to purchase the apartment meal plan.
During the first year at USC, freshmen are required to purchase an extensive dining hall meal plan ranging from $2,950 to $3,750 that covers most, if not all, of their meals. Most freshmen live in a small dorm room without a kitchen, so this requirement of a dining hall meal plan makes sense. Without the dining hall, a freshman’s only other alternative would be to eat out for every meal. 
But USC requires that almost all students living in apartments under USC Housing purchase a meal plan. Totaling $1,260 for the year, the plan includes 40 swipes and $150 in dining dollars each semester. Dining dollars act like cash but can only be used at certain restaurants on campus.  
Excluding the $300 worth of dining dollars throughout the year, that leaves the apartment meal plan charging students $960 for 80 swipes. This equates to a student purchasing a $12 meal anytime they go into the dining hall. Although this may not seem like a lot for one meal, it adds up over time. Students can easily find cheaper alternatives by shopping for ingredients at the local grocery store. For example, a student could make a dinner of chicken, brussel sprouts and sweet potatoes for under $10 using ingredients from the Trader Joe’s on campus.
Additionally, because the 80 swipes included in the plan only account for a little less than three meals a week for the whole academic year, students on the apartment meal plan cannot live entirely off the dining hall. They need to be able to cook for themselves anyway. This means students must purchase kitchen appliances like a microwave, toaster, pots and pans, but then cannot make full use of their investment. This makes the $1,260 of the plan an added cost rather than a deal or benefit. 
The 40 swipes doesn’t even roll over to the next semester, which adds unnecessary structure to a student’s eating schedule. So, if a student has swipes left over at the end of the semester, their money has gone to waste. This rigidness makes it likely that students will not get the most out of what they paid for.
For students with special dietary restrictions, eating in the dining hall can be especially difficult. Parkside Restaraunt and Grill  is the only dining hall with an Allergen Awareness Zone. It is also the only facility on campus that is a peanut/nut sensitive facility. However, the online dietary accommodations flyer concedes that even at Parkside “ingredients may still be produced in a facility that handles tree nuts/peanuts.” For those with certain allergies and restrictions, the dining halls pose a risk to their health. Yet, if these same students live in apartments, they are required to pay for a plan that includes 80 swipes to dining halls. 
Certainly, for many students the process of planning meals, grocery shopping and cooking for themselves is a new and overwhelming concept. It is perfectly fine that some students would rather get a little help every now and then from the dining hall. 
The problem is when students are forced to pay for a meal plan they don’t want and end up spending more than $1,000 on something they don’t use. After freshman year, students who do not need the dining hall should be given the option to exercise independence and the process of learning self-sufficiency without interference from the University.
